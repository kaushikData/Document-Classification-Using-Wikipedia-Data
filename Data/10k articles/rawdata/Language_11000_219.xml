      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4925">{{About|the pop culture phenomena in Indonesia|other uses|Alai (disambiguation){{!}}Alai}}

{{unreferenced|date=May 2018}}
'''{{lang|id|Alay}}''' (or ''4L4Y'', ''{{lang|id|Anak Layangan}}'', ''Anak Jablay'' or ''{{lang|id|Anak Lebay}}'') is an [[Indonesia]]n [[popular culture|pop culture]] phenomenon. It is a [[stereotype]] describing something "tacky" and "cheesy" ''{{lang|id|norak}}'' or ''{{lang|id|kampungan}}''. The Alay culture phenomena spans a wide array of styles in [[music]], [[dress]], and [[messaging]]. It has often been compared to that of the [[Jejemon]] phenomenon originating from the Philippines, and [[Japanese street fashion|Harajuku]] from Japan. Although, the former emerged much later and the latter was even admired in the West.

==Etymology==
The word "Alay" or "Alayen" has no exact meaning or obvious derivation. Various definitions of alay are offered when one types it on a [[search engine]]. One theory that is widely accepted is that "Alay" is a [[portmanteau]] of the term "{{lang|id|Anak Layangan}}" ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: Kiteflyer), a pejorative describing someone having certain physical attributes from spending most of their time outside and getting sunburnt (e.g. reddened hair and skin). Also kite is considered as cheap entertainment to the middle and lower class in modern Indonesia, stereotyping alay as a part of that class. Alay is also consider as people who have these traits; Throwing garbage not in the trash can and also love to creates commotion.

==Characteristics==

===Writing style===
''{{lang|id|Alay text}}'' (Indonesian: Tulisan alay) is a form of the Indonesian language that has undergone "excessive [[leet]] transformation". Contrary to the popular belief that it is "destroying" the [[Indonesian language|national language]], grammatical standards are met in contrast to the modern [[Indonesian slang]] language. Similar to the [[Jejemon#Jejenese and Jejebet|jejebets]], alay texts offer an alternative in compressing words so that they are under the 160 character-limit in [[text messages]], often to the point that they are impossible to read. Rules in capitalization are [[CamelCase|mostly ignored]].

Alay text may have originated from the method of making strong passwords for internet accounts, which requires combinations of small and capital letters, numbers, as well as special characters. Normally, to keep the password meaningful and easy to remember, the password would consist of normal words, where some letters are capitalized or substituted with numbers (e.g. the letter a with 4, the letter o with 0). Soon this becomes a habit in writing text in general, and improved with mixing [[English Language|English]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] in one sentence.

Confusing text that could not be understood properly and probably has no meaning (except for the writer), is also considered as Alay Text. This type of text usually contains information of the writer's mood and feeling, it is also common for the text to contain the writer's own philosophy on a certain topic such as : love, heart break, and relationship.

According to ''[[The Jakarta Post]]'', a high school student from East Java initiated the trend and shot to fame after her writings were discussed in forums and blogs not because they were great, but they were in "code". Her approach in writing attracted a lot of attention, with some people reproducing her writing in forums and blogs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4861">'''Ananta Rau Sar Dessai''' (1910-?) was a Goan short-story writer, radio playwright and poet. He was one of a handful of Goan Hindus to have used Portuguese as his literary language, though he wrote also in Marathi. He was perhaps the only dedicated fictionist in Portuguese to have operated in Goa throughout the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]].&lt;ref&gt;Vimala Devi and Manuel de Seabra. ''A Literatura Indo-Portuguesa''. Lisbon: Junta de Investigações do Ultramar, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; 'His idiosyncratic language, raw provocative themes, and the great ambiguity with which he treats his subjects, make Sar Dessai one of the more interesting Goan writers to have worked in Portuguese'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro, ''Lengthening Shadows'', 2 vols (Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016), I p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in 1910 and practised medicine in the town of [[Mardol, Goa|Mardol]], Goa. He drew on his experience as a clinician for many of his plays and short narratives, such as "Um Cavalheiro Amável" [A Pleasant Gentleman] and "Vaxina, dá-me um pouco de Vaxina também" [Vacshin, give me some vacshin too].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro, ''Lengthening Shadows'', 2 vols (Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016), I pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==

Sau Dessai penned over 30 radio plays, some of which were broadcast, for example via the former ''[[Emissora de Goa]]''. Others were published in the now-defunct Portuguese-language press of Goa, in papers such as ''[[O Heraldo]]'' and ''A Luta''. He also wrote in Marathi, but little work has been done to establish his corpus in this language.&lt;ref&gt;Vimala Devi and Manuel de Seabra. ''A Literatura Indo-Portuguesa''. Lisbon: Junta de Investigações do Ultramar, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes in his Short Stories and Radio Plays===

Sar Dessai's short stories are often about poverty and the lack of social justice. Indeed, in some of his stories, Sar Dessai is the closest Goa had in the Portuguese-language to an explicitly anti-colonial literary stance towards [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]'s [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro. "Dictatorship, liberation, transition in the short fiction of three Portuguese-language Goan writers: Alberto de Menezes Rodrigues, Ananta Rau Sar Dessai and Telo de Mascarenhas". ''Journal of Romance Studies'', 13(2), 2013, pp.1–18&lt;/ref&gt; Rare for a writer of his time, several of his narratives take place in the hinterland of Goa known as the [[Novas Conquistas]], where Hindus have always formed the majority of the population and where the effects of Portuguese colonialism were rather different than in the coastal strip of Goa.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro, ''Lengthening Shadows'', 2 vols (Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016), I pp. 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loss of Anthology====

An anthology of Sar Dessai's short stories and radio plays was prepared by the Portuguese critic Manuel de Seabra in the mid 1970s. It was submitted to the Agência Geral do Ultramar, the Portuguese government agency dedicated to publishing work from the Portuguese overseas territories, but never commissioned and the manuscript never returned. The likelihood is that the manuscript was discarded when the dictatorship fell. Unless a copy of these texts has been retained in Goa - Seabra did not keep a copy for his personal records - it seems that at least half the author's oeuvre has unfortunately been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro, ''Lengthening Shadows'', 2 vols (Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016), I pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poems in Portuguese===

Sar Dessai's few poems in Portuguese were written after 1961 and mostly concern Indian nationalist themes.

Through the summers of 1933 and 1934, Jacobs interviewed Peterson in those two languages, collecting 32 Coos myth texts in Miluk, eight in Hanis, and two in both Hanis and Miluk for comparison of the two languages.

'''Arawakan''' (''Arahuacan, Maipuran Arawakan, "mainstream" Arawakan, Arawakan proper''), also known as '''Maipurean''' (also ''Maipuran, Maipureano, Maipúre''), is a [[language family]] that developed among ancient [[indigenous peoples in South America]]. Branches migrated to  [[Central America]] and the Greater Antilles in the Caribbean and the Atlantic, including what is now the Bahamas. Only present-day [[Ecuador]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Chile]] did not have peoples who spoke Arawakan languages. Maipurean may be related to other language families in a hypothetical [[Macro-Arawakan]] stock.

The name ''Maipure'' was given to the family by [[Filippo S. Gilij]] in 1782, after the [[Maipure language]] of [[Venezuela]], which he used as a basis of his comparisons. It was renamed after the culturally more important [[Arawak language]] a century later. The term ''Arawak'' took over, until its use was extended by North American scholars to the broader [[Macro-Arawakan languages|Macro-Arawakan]] proposal. At that time, the name ''Maipurean'' was resurrected for the core family. See [[Arawakan languages#Arawakan vs. Maipurean|Arawakan ''vs'' Maipurean]] for details.

==Languages==
Classification of Maipurean is difficult because of the large number of Arawakan languages that are [[extinct]] and poorly documented. However, apart from transparent relationships that might constitute single languages, several groups of Maipurean languages are generally accepted by scholars. Many classifications agree in dividing Maipurean into northern and southern branches, but perhaps not all languages fit into one or the other. The three classifications below are accepted by all:
*[[Ta-Maipurean]] = Caribbean Arawak / Ta-Arawak = Caribbean Maipuran,
*[[Upper Amazon Maipurean]] = North Amazonian Arawak = Inland Maipuran,
*[[Central Maipurean]] = Pareci–Xingu = Paresí–Waurá = Central Maipuran,
*[[Piro languages|Piro]] = Purus,
*[[Campa languages|Campa]] = Pre-Andean Maipurean = Pre-Andine Maipuran.

An early contrast between ''Ta-Arawak'' and ''Nu-Arawak'', depending on the prefix for "I", is spurious; ''nu-'' is the ancestral form for the entire family, and ''ta-'' is an innovation of one branch of the family.

===Kaufman (1994)===
The following (tentative) classification is from Kaufman (1994: 57-60). Details of established branches are given in the linked articles. In addition to the family tree detailed below, there are a few languages that are "Non-Maipurean Arawakan languages or too scantily known to classify" (Kaufman 1994: 58), which include these:

* [[Shebaye language|Shebaye]] ''(†)''
* [[Lapachu language|Lapachu]] ''(†)''
* [[Morique language|Morique]] (also known as Morike) ''(†)''

Another language is also mentioned as "Arawakan":
* [[Enawené-Nawé language|Salumã]] (also known as Salumán, Enawené-Nawé)

Including the unclassified languages mentioned above, the Maipurean family has about 64 languages. Out of them, 29 languages are now [[extinct language|extinct]]: Wainumá, Mariaté, Anauyá, Amarizana, Jumana, Pasé, Cawishana, Garú, Marawá, Guinao, [[Yavitero language|Yavitero]], Maipure, Manao, Kariaí, Waraikú, Yabaána, Wiriná, Aruán, Taíno, Kalhíphona, Marawán-Karipurá, Saraveca, Custenau, Inapari, Kanamaré, Shebaye, Lapachu, and Morique.

* ''[[Campa languages|Campa]] branch'' (also known as Pre-Andean)

Kaufman does not report extinct [[Magiana language|Magiana]] of the Moxos group.

===Aikhenvald (1999)===
Apart from minor decisions on whether a variety is a language or a dialect, changing names, and not addressing several poorly attested languages, Aikhenvald departs from Kaufman in breaking up the ''Southern Outlier'' and ''Western'' branches of Southern Maipurean. She assigns Salumã and Lapachu ('[[Apolista]]') to what is left of Southern Outlier ('South Arawak'); breaks up the ''Maritime'' branch of Northern Maipurean, though keeping Aruán and Palikur together; and is agnostic about the sub-grouping of the ''North Amazonian'' branch of Northern Maipurean.

The following breakdown uses Aikhenvald's nomenclature followed by Kaufman's: 
;North Arawak = Northern Maipurean
*Rio Branco = Kaufman's Wapishanan (2) [with Mapidian under the name "[[Mawayana language|Mawayana]]" and Mawakwa as a possible dialect]
*Palikur = Kaufman's Palikur + [[Aroã language|Aruán]] (3)
*[[Caribbean Arawakan|Caribbean]] = Ta-Maipurean (8) [incl. [[Shebaye language|Shebaye]]]
*[[Upper Amazon Arawakan|North Amazonian]] = Upper Amazon (17 attested)
;South and South-Western Arawak = Southern Maipurean
*South Arawak = [[Terena language|Terena]] + Kaufman's Moxos group + [[Enawene Nawe language|Salumã]] + [[Lapachu language|Lapachu]] ['Apolista'] (11)
*[[Pareci–Xingu]] = Central Maipurean (6)
*[[Piro languages|South-Western Arawak]] = Piro (5)
*[[Campa languages|Campa]] (6)
*[[Amuesha language|Amuesha]] (1)
*[[Chamicuro language|Chamicuro]] (1)

Aikhenvald classifies Kaufman's unclassified languages apart from [[Morique language|Morique]]. She does not classify 15 extinct languages which Kaufman had placed in various branches of Maipurean.

Aikhenvald (1999:69) classifies [[Mawayana language|Mawayana]] with [[Wapishana language|Wapishana]] together under a Rio Branco branch, giving for Mawayana also the names "Mapidian" and "Mawakwa" (with some reservations for the latter).

===Walker &amp; Ribeiro (2011)===
Walker &amp; Ribeiro (2011), using [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] [[computational phylogenetics]], classify the Arawakan languages as follows.

==Arawakan vs. Maipurean==
In 1783, the Italian priest [[Filippo Salvatore Gilii]] recognized the unity of the [[Maipure language]] of the Orinoco and [[Moxos language|Moxos]] of Bolivia; he named their family ''Maipure''. It was renamed ''Arawak'' by Von den Steinen (1886) and Brinten (1891) after [[Arawak language|Arawak]] in the Guianas, one of the major languages of the family. The modern equivalents are ''Maipurean'' or ''Maipuran'' and ''Arawak'' or ''Arawakan''.

The term ''Arawakan'' is now used in two senses. South American scholars use ''Aruák'' for [[Maipurean languages|the family demonstrated by Gilij]] and subsequent linguists. In North America, however, scholars have used the term to include a hypothesis adding the [[Guajiboan languages|Guajiboan]] and [[Arauan languages|Arawan]] families. In North America, scholars use the name ''Maipurean'' to distinguish the core family, which is sometimes called ''core Arawak(an)'' or ''Arawak(an) proper'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;Walker &amp; Ribeiro (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufman (1990: 40) relates the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Arawakan] name is the one normally applied to what is here called Maipurean. Maipurean used to be thought to be a major subgroup of Arawakan, but all the ''living'' Arawakan languages, at least, seem to need to be subgrouped with languages already found within Maipurean as commonly defined. The sorting out of the labels Maipurean and Arawakan will have to await a more sophisticated classification of the languages in question than is possible at the present state of comparative studies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Characteristics==
The languages called Arawakan or Maipurean were originally recognized as a separate group in the late nineteenth century. Almost all the languages now called Arawakan share a first-person singular prefix ''nu-'', but Arawak proper has ''ta-''. Other commonalities include a second-person singular ''pi-'', relative ''ka-'', and negative ''ma-''.

The Arawak language family, as constituted by L. Adam, at first by the name of Maypure, has been called by Von den Steinen "Nu-Arawak" from the prenominal prefix "nu-" for the first person. This is common to all the Arawak tribes scattered along the coasts from Dutch Guiana to British Guiana.

Upper Paraguay has Arawakan-language tribes: the ''Quinquinaos'', the ''Layanas'', etc. (This is the ''Moho-Mbaure'' group of L. Quevedo). In the islands of Marajos, in the middle of the estuary of the Amazon, the ''Aruan'' people spoke an Arawak dialect. The peninsula of Goajira (north of [[Venezuela]]) is occupied by the Goajires tribe, also Arawakan speakers. In 1890–95, De Brette estimated a population of 3,000 persons in the Goajires.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald (1999), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

C. H. de Goeje's published vocabulary of 1928 outlines the Lokono/Arawak (Dutch and Guiana) 1400 items, mostly morphemes (stems, affixes) and morpheme partials (single sounds) – rarely compounded, derived, or otherwise complex sequences; and from Nancy P. Hickerson's ''British Guiana'' manuscript vocabulary of 500 items. However, most entries which reflect acculturation are direct borrowings from one or another of three model languages (Spanish, Dutch, English).  Of the 1400 entries in de Goeje, 106 reflect European contact; 98 of these are loans. Nouns which occur with the verbalizing suffix described above number 9 out of the 98 loans.&lt;ref&gt;Deniker (1900), pp. 556–557.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
Though a great deal of variation can be found from language to language, the following is a general composite statement of the consonants and vowels typically found in Arawak languages, according to Aikhenvald (1999):

==Shared morphological traits==

===General morphological type===
Arawakan languages are polysynthetic and mostly head-marking. They have fairly complex verb morphology. Noun morphology is much less complex and tends to be similar across the family. Arawakan languages are mostly suffixing, with just a few prefixes.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald (1999), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alienable and inalienable possession===
Arawakan languages tend to distinguish alienable and inalienable possession. A feature found throughout the Arawakan family is a suffix (whose reconstructed Proto-Arawakan form is /*-tsi/) that allows the inalienable (and obligatorily possessed) body-part nouns to remain unpossessed.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald (1999), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; This suffix essentially converts inalienable body-part nouns into alienable nouns. It can only be added to body-part nouns and not to kinship nouns (which are also treated as inalienable). An example from the Pareci language is given below:&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald (1999), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

:{|
| ''no-tiho''
|-
| 1SG-face
|-
| my face
|}

:{|
| ''tiho-ti''
|-
| face-ALIEN
|-
| (someone’s) face
|}

===Classifiers===
Many Arawakan languages have a system of classifier morphemes that mark the semantic category of the head noun of a noun phrase on most other elements of the noun phrase.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald (1999), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The example below is from the Tariana language, in which classifier suffixes mark the semantic category of the head noun on all elements of a noun phrase other than the head noun (including adjectives, numerals, demonstratives, possessives) and on the verb of the clause:&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald (1999), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

:{|
| ''ha-dapana'' || ''pa-dapana'' || ''pani-si'' || ''nu-ya-dapana'' || ''hanu-dapana''
|-
| DEM-CL:HOUSE || one-CL:HOUSE || house-NON.POSSV || 1SG-POSSV-CL:HOUSE || big-CL:HOUSE
|}

:{|
| ''heku'' || ''na-ni-ni-dapana-mahka''
|-
| wood || 3PL-make-TOPIC.ADVANCING.VOICE-CL.HOUSE-REC.PAST.NON.VISUAL
|-
| colspan="2" | 'This one big house of mine is made of wood.'
|}

===Subject and object cross-referencing on the verb===
Most Arawakan languages have split-intransitive alignment systems of subject and object cross-referencing on the verb.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald (1999), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The agentive arguments of both transitive and intransitive verbs are marked with prefixes, whereas the patientive arguments of both transitive and intransitive verbs are marked with suffixes. The following example from Baniwa of Içana shows a typical Arawakan split-intransitive alignment:&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald (1999), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

:{|
| ''ri-kapa-ni''
|-
| 3SG.NFEM.AGENT-see-3SG.NFEM.PATIENT
|-
| 'He sees him/it.'
|}

:{|
| ''ri-emhani''
|-
| 3SG.NFEM.AGENT-walk
|-
| 'He walks.'
|}

:{|
| ''hape-ka-ni''
|-
| be.cold-DECL-3SG.NFEM.PATIENT
|-
| 'He/it is cold.'
|}

The prefixes and suffixes used for subject and object cross-referencing on the verb are stable throughout the Arawakan languages, and can therefore be reconstructed for Proto-Arawakan. The table below shows the likely forms of Proto-Arawakan:&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald (1999), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|  || Prefixes&lt;br&gt; (mark agent) || || Suffixes&lt;br&gt; (mark patient) ||
|-
| person || SG || PL {{spaces|10}} || SG || PL {{spaces|10}}
|-

|-
| 2 || (p)i- || (h)i- || -pi || -hi

|}

==Some examples==
The Arawak word for maize is ''marisi,'' and various forms of this word are found among the related tribal languages:
: [[Lokono]], ''marisi'', Guyana.
: [[Taíno]], ''mahisi'', Greater Antilles.
: Cauixana, ''mazy'', Rio Jupura.
: [[Wayuu]], ''maikki'', Goajira Peninsula.
: Passes, ''mary'', Lower Jupura.
: Puri, ''maky'', Rio Paraiba.
: Wauja, ''mainki'', Upper Xingu River.

==Geographic distribution==
Arawak is the largest family in the Americas with the respect to number of languages. The Arawakan languages are spoken by peoples occupying a large swath of territory, from the eastern slopes of the central [[Andes Mountains]] in [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], across the [[Amazon basin]] of [[Brazil]], northward into [[Suriname]], [[Guyana]], [[French Guiana|French Guyana]], [[Venezuela]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Colombia]] on the northern coast of South America, and as far north as [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Belize]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald (1999), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The languages used to be found in [[Argentina]] and [[Paraguay]] as well.

Arawak-speaking peoples migrated to islands in the Caribbean, settling the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas.  It is possible that some poorly attested extinct languages in North America, such as the [[Cusabo people|Cusabo]] and [[Congaree people|Congaree]] in South Carolina, were members of this family.&lt;ref&gt;Rudes (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taíno language|Taíno]], commonly called Island Arawak, was spoken on the islands of [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Jamaica]], and the [[Bahamas]]. A few Taino words are still used by [[English language|English]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking descendants in these islands. The Taíno language was scantily attested but its classification within the Arawakan family is uncontroversial. Its closest relative among the better attested Arawakan languages seems to be the [[Goajiro language]], spoken in Colombia. Scholars have suggested that the Goajiro are descended from Taíno [[refugee]]s, but the theory seems impossible to prove or disprove.{{Citation needed|date = July 2015}}

[[Garifuna language|Garífuna]] (or Black Carib) is another interesting Arawakan language originating on the islands.  It developed as the result of forced migration among people of mixed Arawak, Carib, and African descent.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald (1999), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated to have about 195,800 speakers in [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Belize]] combined.&lt;ref&gt;"Garifuna" (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the Arawakan languages with the most speakers are among the more recent ''Ta-''Arawakan (''Ta-''Maipurean) groups: [[Wayuu language|Wayuu]] [Goajiro], with about 300,000 speakers; and [[Garifuna language|Garifuna]], with about 100,000 speakers. The Campa group is next; [[Asháninka language|Asháninca]] or Campa proper has 15–18,000 speakers; and Ashéninca 18–25,000. After that probably comes [[Terena language|Terêna]], with 10,000 speakers; and [[Yanesha' language|Yanesha']] [Amuesha] with 6–8,000.{{Citation needed|date = July 2015}}

[[File:Bergakker runes.png|thumb|Visual copy of the Elder Futhark runes on the inscription.]]
The '''Bergakker inscription''' is an [[Elder Futhark inscription]] discovered on the scabbard of a 5th-century [[Migration Period sword|sword]]. It was found in 1996 in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] town of [[Bergakker]], near [[Tiel]] (in the [[Betuwe]], once the habitat of the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Looijenga | first = Tineke | title = Texts &amp; contexts of the oldest Runic inscriptions | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden Boston | page = 72 | year = 2003 | isbn = 9004123962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is consensus that the find dates from the period 425-475 and that the inscription is either the singular direct attestation of [[Frankish language|Frankish]] (Franconian) or the earliest attestation of [[Old Dutch]] (Old Low Franconian).

== Inscription ==
[[Runes|Runic writing]] at the time was used along the [[North Sea]] coast, in [[Frisia]], but there are very few other known inscriptions from [[Francia]]. The inscription can be read as

where '''V''' is a non-standard rune, apparently a vowel (variously read as ''e'' or ''u'', or as "any vowel"). 

Several readings have been presented in literature. There seems to be a consensus that the ''ann'' means "give/bestow/grant". Several authors read the first word as a personal name in the genitive (indicating property), and the last word as meaning "flame, brand", a [[kenning]] for swords. The third word is read either as ''kusjam'', meaning "chooser" or "chosen", or as ''ke(i)sjam'' meaning "cut" or "cutter", also referring to swords or sword wielders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.museumhetvalkhof.nl/collecties/archeologie/collectie-topstukken-archeologie/runeninscriptie-met-het-oudste-nederlands |title=Runeninscriptie met het oudste Nederlands(?) |series=Museum piece information |publisher=[[Valkhof Museum]] |language=Dutch |script-title= |trans-title=Runic inscription with the oldest Dutch(?) |access-date=10 November 2017 |quote=All experts agree on the meaning of the second word: "I (he) grant(s)", and many consider the first word to be the name of the owner of the sword that the scabbard belonged to.

Keeping in mind the function of the piece, some academics read the last word as "sword(s)".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scholarly interpretations === 
* Quak (2000): ''Ha(þu)þ[e]was ann k(u)sjam log(u)ns'', interpreting it as "[property] of Haþuþewaz. I bestow upon the choosers of the swords".
* Vennemann (1999): ''Haþ(ur)s ann k(u)sjam lōg(u)ns'' "[property] of Haþur. I grant lodging to the swordblades".
* Seebold (1999): ''h(ǫ)þ(u)was ann k(u)sjam log(u)ns.'' "I grant combat to the choosers of the sword".

* Looijenga (1999): ''Hā(le)þ(e)was ann k(e)sjam log(e)ns.'' "[property] of Hāleþewaz: He grants the swords to the swordfighters" (possibly a maker's inscription).
* Bammesberger (1999): '' Haþ(u)þ(u)ras ann k(u)s(j)am lōg(u)n[r]...'' "I grant to Haþuþuraʀ and his chosen [bride] the wedding-rune".
* Mees (2002): ''Ha(þu)þ[ȳ]was ann k(u)sjam lōguns.'' "[property] of Haþuþȳwaʀ. He grants a flame [=brand, sword] to the chosen".
* Grünzweig (2004): ''Ha(þu)þ(ewa)s ann k(u)sjam log(ō)ns'' "[property] of Haþuþyewaʀ - he grants the choosers [enemies?] the flame [sword?]".

=== Comparison with legend ===
{{Original research|section|date=June 2016}}
There is a possibility that the text refers to the Dutch-Flemish folk tale which survives in folk ballad '[[Heer Halewijn|Van Here Halewijn]]' (in English: The Song of Lord Halewijn). In that case the reading would be: ''Hā(le)þ(uin)s ann k(u)sjam log(u)ns'' "I grant Halewijn's [sword] to the chooser of the sword(s)", the chooser of the sword (vs. the noose) being the maiden/princess about to be killed by Lord Halewijn.

'''Berrichon''' is an [[Langues d'oïl|Oïl language]] very closely related to [[French language|French]] or a [[dialect]] of it traditionally spoken in the historical area of the French province of [[Berry (province)|Berry]]. The word is also used as a [[demonym]] and as an adjective meaning "pertaining to Berry".

==History==
The dialect evolved out of the [[langues d'oïl]] which evolved during the Middle Ages out of the [[Vulgar Latin]] spoken in northern [[Gaul]]. Its general use in the Berry region began to decline in the sixteenth century as the local aristocracy and bourgeoisie began to adopt [[History of French#Through Early Modern French.2C c. 1700 AD|standard French]], leaving Berrichon as a "[[patois]]" used by the peasantry in the countryside. Subsequent developments, such as the [[French Revolution]], which created a sense of [[nationalism]], and the [[Jules Ferry laws|establishment of free, mandatory, primary education]] under the Minister of Public Instruction, [[Jules Ferry]], which greatly expanded the teaching of French, further undermined the position of Berrichon.

==Current status==
The decline of Berrichon has virtually led to it being regarded as a sub-standard dialect of French rather than a separate language. Additionally, as most speakers in its region now speak standard French, it is no longer possible to say that a Berrichon "patois" exists, but rather that a regional version of French does. Nevertheless, traces of Berrichon and its regional varieties remain today. This is exemplified in the continued use of Berrichon terms in spoken French among speakers in the region.

==Phonology and lexicon==
Although Berrichon does not have an official grammar or pronunciation, there are general rules as to how it differs from French. Berrichon differentiates between closed and open ''a''. ''R''s are [[Alveolar trill|rolled]] and emphatic. Words which have the ''[[Close-mid back rounded vowel|o]]'' sound in standard French are pronounced with a [[close back rounded vowel]], resulting in, for example, ''un houmme'' (man), ''une poumme'' (apple). The ''oi'' [wa] sound becomes ''oé'' [oe].  The [[suffix]] -''eur'' becomes -''eux'' in Berrichon, and -''eau'' becomes -''iau''; therefore, ''leurs'' (theirs) is ''ieux'' and ''un seau d'eau'' (a bucket of water) is ''un siau d'iau''.

Conjugation is also different. The [[Present indicative#French present indicative tense|present indicative]] of the first-[[Grammatical person|person]] singular, the third-person singular and the third-person plural are all conjugated in the same manner, which results in phrases of the type, "''j'menons les oies''" ("I lead the [[Goose|geese]]"). There is also frequent truncation: "''i m'nons les oies''" ("they lead the geese"). Tense endings are also different from standard French, as in the third person plural [[Imperfect#French|imperfect]] ending ''-aient'' is replaced by ''-aint'', e.g., "''i's étaint''" instead of "''ils étaient''" ("They used to be").

In Berry, it is customary to precede given names with [[article (grammar)|article]]s: ''la'' for women's names and ''eul'' for men's names.

When referring to weather terms, the pronoun ''ça'' is used in place of the French ''il''. For example, "Il pleut" (''It is raining.'') would be  "Ça pleut" in Berrichon.

Examples of Berrichon vocabulary being used instead of their French counterparts include:

The '''Carrier language''' is a [[Northern Athabaskan language]]. It is named after the [[Dakelh]] people, a [[First Nations]] people of the [[British Columbia Interior|Central Interior of British Columbia]], Canada, for whom Carrier is the usual English name.  People who are referred to as Carrier speak two related languages. One, [[Babine-Witsuwit'en]] is sometimes referred to as ''Northern Carrier''. The other, Carrier proper, includes what are sometimes referred to as ''Central Carrier'' and ''Southern Carrier''.

There are three series of stops and affricates: aspirated, unaspirated (written voiced in the practical orthography), and ejective.

{{IPA|/r/}} is not native to the language but has been introduced by loans from French and English. {{IPA|/f/}} occurs in a single loanword "coffee". The labialized voiced velar fricative {{IPA|/ɣʷ/}} is found only in the speech of the most conservative speakers; for most speakers it has merged with {{IPA|/w/}}. The palatal nasal {{IPA|/ɲ/}} occurs allophonically before other palatal consonants; otherwise, it occurs only in a small set of [[grammatical person|2nd-person singular]] morphemes. For most speakers it has become an {{IPA|[n̩j]}} sequence, with a syllabic {{IPA|[n]}}. Similarly, the velar nasal {{IPA|/ŋ/}} occurs allophonically before other velar consonants but is found distinctively in one or two morphemes in each dialect.

Carrier once had a dental/alveolar (or [[laminal consonant|laminal]]/[[apical consonant|apical]]) distinction, attested in the earliest grammatical treatise of the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. However, by 1976 this had been leveled to the present alveolar series among younger speakers, and in 1981 the dental/laminal series (marked by underlining the consonant) was said to be found in only the "very oldest speakers".  Poser (2005) states that it is found in only the most conservative speech. In even the earliest description, there is evidence of the distinction being neutralized.

====Vowels====

Carrier has six surface-phonemic vowels: {{IPA|/i/, /u/, /e/, /o/, /a/,}} and {{IPA|/ə/}}. The first four are [[Tense vowel|tense]] in open syllables and [[Lax vowel|lax]] in closed syllables. The reduced vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} is quite variable in its realization: it approaches {{IPA|[i]}} immediately preceding {{IPA|/j/}} and approaches {{IPA|[a]}} when either or both adjacent consonants are [[Glottal consonants|laryngeal]]. Unlike in some related languages, there is no distinctive nasalization; that is, Carrier does not contrast [[oral vowel|oral]] and [[nasal vowel]]s.

The great majority of instances of {{IPA|/ə/}} are predictable from the phonotactics, introduced in order to create an acceptable syllable structure. The remaining instances are all found in certain forms of the verb where the morphology requires some vowel to be present.

In most if not all dialects there are surface-phonemic distinctions of [[vowel length]]. However, all of the long vowels that create such distinctions are morphophonemically derived. There is no need to represent vowel length in lexical representations.

====Tone====
Carrier has a very simple [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] system of the type often described as [[pitch accent]]—it is in fact very similar to the prototypical pitch-accent language, [[Japanese pitch accent|Japanese]]. In Carrier, a word may or may not have a tonic syllable. If it does not, the pitch rises gradually across the phonological word. If it does have a tonic syllable, then that syllable has a high pitch, the following syllable [[downstep]]s to a low pitch, and subsequent syllables until the end of the [[prosodic unit]] are also low pitched. Any syllable in the word may carry the accent; if it is the final syllable, then the first syllable of the following word is low pitched, even if it would otherwise be tonic. Representing this phonemic drop in pitch with the downstep symbol {{IPA|ꜜ}}, there is a contrast between the surface tone following an unaccented word ''xoh'' "goose" compared with the accented word ''yesꜜ'' "wolf":

:{{IPA|[xóh niɬʔén]}}
:"He sees the goose."

:{{IPA|[jésꜜ nìɬʔèn]}}
:"He sees the wolf."

However, after a tonic syllable, the high pitch of ''yesꜜ'' "wolf" is lost:

:{{IPA|[ʔiɬóꜜ jèsꜜ]}}
:"One wolf"

===Phonotactics===
In general the Carrier syllable is maximally CVC. All consonants other than the extremely rare {{IPA|/ŋ/}} are found in syllable-initial position. The possible coda consonants, on the other hand, are restricted. All of the sonorants except for the extremely rare palatal nasal may occur in the coda, but of the obstruents only the pulmonic unaspirated series occur. Affricates are not found in the coda with the exception of a few instances of {{IPA|/ts/}}. Palatals are also absent from the coda.

Word-internally consonant clusters occur only at the juncture between two syllables. Tautosyllablic clusters are found only word-initially, where any of the onset consonants may be preceded by {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/ɬ/}}.

Nasals at all points of articulation are syllabic word-initially preceding a consonant.

==Writing system==
The writing system in general use today is the [http://www.ydli.org/dakinfo/clcexp.htm Carrier Linguistic Committee] writing system, a Roman-based system developed in the 1960s by [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]] missionaries and a group of Carrier people with whom they worked. The CLC writing system was designed to be typed on a standard English typewriter. It uses numerous digraphs and trigraphs to write the many Carrier consonants not found in English, e.g. {{angle bracket|gh}} for {{IPA|[ɣ]}} and {{angle bracket|lh}} for {{IPA|[ɬ]}}, with an apostrophe to mark glottalization, e.g. {{angle bracket|ts'}} for the ejective alveolar affricate. Letters generally have their English rather than European values. For example, {{angle bracket|u}} represents {{IPA|/ə/}} while {{angle bracket|oo}} represents {{IPA|/u/}}.

The only diacritic it uses in its standard form is the underscore, which is written under the sibilants ({{angle bracket|s̲}}, {{angle bracket|z̲}}, {{angle bracket|t̲s̲}}, and {{angle bracket|d̲z̲}}) to indicate that the consonant is laminal [[denti-alveolar]] rather than apical alveolar. An acute accent is sometimes used to mark high tone, but tone is not routinely written in Carrier.

[[Image:NakazdliGraveyardBelzeniHeadstone.jpg|thumb|right|A grave inscribed in Carrier Syllabics]]

Carrier was formerly written in a writing system inspired by the [[Cree syllabics|Cree Syllabics]] known variously as the [[Carrier syllabics]] or Déné Syllabics. This writing system was widely used for several decades from its inception in 1885 but began to fade in the 1930s. Today only a few people can read it.

A good deal of scholarly material, together with the first edition of the "Little Catechism" and the Third Edition of the Prayerbook, is written in the writing system used by Father [[Adrien-Gabriel Morice]] in his scholarly work. This writing system is a somewhat idiosyncratic version of the phonetic transcription of the time. It is subphonemic and was never used by Carrier people themselves, though many learned to read the Prayerbook in it.

==Morphology==

===Nouns===
Carrier nouns are inflected for possession, including the [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]] of the possessor. [[Possession (linguistics)|Possession]] is marked by [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefixation]] as well, in some cases, as changes in the noun stem. Number is marked only on nouns denoting human beings and dogs, and these distinguish only singular and plural. Some dialects of Carrier have no number distinctions in nouns at all.

A noun has six basic personal possessive forms:

Possessive Paradigm of ''stick''
{|border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="10"
!
!sg
!pl
|-
!1
|{{IPA|/sdətʃən/}}
|{{IPA|/nedətʃən/}}
|-
!2
|{{IPA|/ndətʃən/}}
|{{IPA|/nahdətʃən/}}
|-
!3
|{{IPA|/udətʃən/}}
|{{IPA|/bədətʃən/}}
|}

Reading row-wise, these mean "my stick", "our stick", "your (1 person) stick", "your (two or more people) stick", "his/her/its stick", and "their stick".

However, in some dialects, such as that of Stony Creek, there is a distinction between first person dual and first person plural possessors:

Possessive Paradigm of ''stick'' (Stoney Creek dialect)
{|border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="10"

|-
!3
|{{IPA|/udətʃən/}}
|{{IPA|/həbədətʃən/}}
|{{IPA|/həbədətʃən/}}
|}

In such dialects, while the 1d and 1p are distinct, the 1d is the same as the 2dp.

There are five additional third person possessive forms:

The areal form is used when the possessor is saliently areal, spatial, or an extent of time. The reflexive is used when the subject of the clause and the possessor are the same, whether singular or plural. The disjoint form is used when both subject and possessor are third person singular and are not the same. The plural disjoint form is used when the subject is third person plural, the possessor is third person singular, and the possessor is not one of the individuals in the subject group. The reciprocal form, meaning "each other's", was used into the early twentieth century but has since fallen out of use.

The twelfth possessive form is almost always found on [[inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]] nouns. These are nouns that may not occur as words in their own right. In Carrier, the great majority of such nouns are either body parts or kinship terms. For example, although we can abstract the stem {{IPA|/ke/}} from forms for "foot" such as {{IPA|/ske/}} ('my foot'), {{IPA|/neke/}} ('our feet'), and {{IPA|/uke/}} ('his foot'), {{IPA|/ke/}} by itself is not a word. It must either occur with a possessive prefix or as part of a compound, such as {{IPA|/kekˈetɬˈu/}} ('sock'). To refer to an inalienably possessed noun without specifying its owner, the indefinite possessive prefix {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is used. The approximate equivalent of "a foot" is therefore {{IPA|/ʔəke/}}.

To describe alienable possession of an inalienably possessed noun, the regular possessive forms are used with the indefinite form as a base rather than the bare stem. Thus, to say "my foot" if the foot is not your own foot but is, for example, a rabbit's foot, you would say {{IPA|[seʔəke]}}. (The fact that the vowel is {{IPA|[e]}} rather than {{IPA|[ə]}} is the result of a phonological rule that changes {{IPA|/ə/}} to {{IPA|[e]}} immediately preceding {{IPA|/ʔ/}} in noun prefixes and in the disjunct zone of the verb.)

Most Dakelh nouns do not have distinct singular and plural forms.
How many items are under discussion may be inferred from context
or may be specified by using a number or quantifier; otherwise, it
remains ambiguous. With very limited exceptions, only nouns denoting
human beings and dogs have distinct plural forms.

The most common way of forming the plural is by adding the suffix {{IPA|/-ne/}}. Thus, we have {{IPA|/dəne/}} "man", {{IPA|/dənene/}} "men", {{IPA|/dakelh/}} "Dakelh person", {{IPA|/dakelhne/}} "Dakelh people".

Nouns derived from verbs by adding the suffix {{IPA|/-ən/}} form their plurals by replacing {{IPA|/-ən/}} with {{IPA|/-ne/}}. Thus we have {{IPA|/hodəɬʔeh-ən/}} "teacher", {{IPA|/hodəɬʔeh-ne/}} "teachers".

A smaller but nonetheless considerable number of nouns take the plural suffix {{IPA|/-ke/}}, e.g. {{IPA|/ɬi/}} "dog", {{IPA|/ɬike/}} "dogs". This is the usual way of making the plural of kinship terms, e.g. {{IPA|/nelu/}} "our mother", {{IPA|/neluke/}} "our mothers". The plural suffix {{IPA|/-ne/}} is occasionally heard on kinship terms, but the suffix {{IPA|/-ke/}} is more widely used and generally considered to be more correct. The plural of "dog" is invariably {{IPA|/ɬike/}}, never {{IPA|/ɬine/}}.

In addition, there are a handful of nouns with irregular
plurals:

&lt;DIV align=center&gt;

{|
|-----
|-----
| Singular || Plural || Gloss
|-----
| {{IPA|ʔat}} || {{IPA|ʔatku}} || wife
|-----
| {{IPA|tʃiɬ}} || {{IPA|tʃilke}} || young man
|-----
| {{IPA|-tʃəl}} || {{IPA|-tʃisle}} || younger brother
|-----
| {{IPA|-dəs}} || {{IPA|-dəsneke}} || ancestor

| {{IPA|kʼeke}} || {{IPA|kʼekuke}} || friend

| {{IPA|tʼet}} || {{IPA|tʼedəku}} || young woman
|-----
| {{IPA|tsʼeke}} || {{IPA|tsʼeku}} || woman
|}
&lt;/DIV&gt;

{{IPA|/ʔat/}} "wife" is also found with the more regular plural {{IPA|/ʔatke/}}.  {{IPA|/tʼet/}} is sometimes found with the double plural {{IPA|/tʼedəkune/}}. {{IPA|/-dəs/}} "parent, ancestor" is also found with the undoubled plural {{IPA|/-dəske/}}.

The exceptions to the statement that only nouns denoting human beings and dogs have distinct plurals are all nouns derived from verbs. The form of the underlying verb may vary with number in such a way as to create distinct number forms for the derived noun.

Where the deverbal noun is derived by means of the agentive suffix {{IPA|/ -ən/}} the verb is almost invariably in the third person singular form, which is to say, not marked for number. Plurality in these forms is normally marked only by the use of the duo-plural agentive suffix {{IPA|/-ne/}} in place of singular {{IPA|/-ən/}}. Zero-derived agentive nouns may show plurality by means of subject markers. For example, "shaman" may be either {{IPA|/dəjən-ən/}}, with an overt agentive suffix, but the zero-marked {{IPA|/dəjən/}} is more common. There are two plural forms: {{IPA|/dəjən-ne/}}, with the duo-plural agentive suffix, and  {{IPA|/hədəjən/}}, in which the zero-marked form is based on the plural form of the verb.

There are two other cases in which the underlying verb may lead to a number distinction in the derived nouns. One is when the verb is restricted in the number of its absolutive argument. For example, there are two verbs "to kill", one that takes a singular or dual object, another that takes a strictly plural object. Since the word "prey" is derived from "kill", there
are a singular-dual form {{IPA|/beˈdə&lt;u&gt;z&lt;/u&gt;əlɡɣe-i/}}, based on the stem
{{IPA|/-ɡhe/}} "kill one or two" and a plural form {{IPA|/beˈdəɣan-i/}},
based on the stem {{IPA|/ɣan/}} "kill three or more".

The other case in which the underlying verb induces a number distinction in the derived noun is when the verb contains a prefix such as distributive {{IPA|/n/}}. For example, {{IPA|/nati/}} "cross-road" has the duo-plural
{{IPA|/nanəti/}}. Similarly, {{IPA|/ˈədzatbeti/}} "rabbit trail" has the duo-plural {{IPA|/ˈədzatbenəti/}}. Such examples arise because the "noun"
{{IPA|/ti/}} "road, trail" is really a verb and takes the distributive
prefix.

Even if a noun possesses a plural form, it is not necessary for it to take on the plural form in order to have a plural meaning. Indeed, there is a strong tendency to avoid overt marking of the plural if plurality is indicated in other ways, in particular, by an immediately following possessed noun. For example, the full form of "Dakelh language" is {{IPA|/dakeɬne bəɣəni/}}, literally "the words of the Dakelh people". Here {{IPA|/dakeɬne/}} consists of {{IPA|/dakeɬ/}} "Dakelh person with the plural suffix {{IPA|/-ne/}}, and {{IPA|/bəɣəni/}} is the third person plural possessed form of {{IPA|/xəni/}} "words". The plurality of the possessor is indicated by the use of the third person duo-plural possessive prefix {{IPA|/bə/}} instead of the third person singular {{IPA|/u/}}. The form {{IPA|/dakeɬ bəɣəni/}}, in which {{IPA|/dakeɬ/}} is not overtly plural-marked, is much preferred.

===Postpositions===

Most postpositions are inflected for their object in a manner closely resembling the marking of possession on nouns. The inflected forms are used when the object is  not a full noun phrase. Here is the paradigm of {{IPA|/ba/}} "for":

Object Paradigm of ''for''
{|border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="10"
!

!pl
|-
!1
|{{IPA|/sba/}}
|{{IPA|/neba/}}
|-

|-
!Disjoint
|{{IPA|/jəba/}}
|-
!Plural disjoint
|{{IPA|/hiba/}}
|-
!Reciprocal
|{{IPA|/ɬba/}}
|}

The postposition {{IPA|/be/}} "by means of" is unusual in being uninflectable. At the other extreme, the postposition {{IPA|/ɬ/}} "together with" is always inflected, even when its object is an overt noun phrase.

Whereas the reciprocal possessive form of nouns is obsolete, the reciprocal object of postpositions remains in common use. The form {{IPA|/ɬba/}}, for example, may be used in roughly the same contexts as the English phrase "for each other".

===Verbs===
The Carrier verb is extremely complex. A single verb may have hundreds of thousands of forms. Verbs are marked for the [[grammatical person|person]] and number of the subject, object, and indirect object, tense, mood, numerous [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]ual categories, and [[negation]]. The subjects of verbs, and in some dialects objects and indirect objects, distinguish singular, dual, and plural numbers. Verbs are also marked for numerous "derivational" categories. For example, a basic motion verb, such as "walk" has derivatives meaning "walk into water", "walk into a hole", "walk ashore", "walk around" and "walk erroneously" (that is, "get lost walking").

The basic paradigm of a verb consists of three persons in three numbers, with the tenses and modes Imperfective, Perfective, Future, and Optative, in both affirmative and negative forms. Notice how the stem of the verb changes with tense/aspect/mode and negation, e.g. {{IPA|/ke/}} in the Imperfective Affirmative but {{IPA|/koh/}} in the Imperfective Negative and {{IPA|/ki/}} in the Perfective Affirmative. In addition to the stem, the forms below contain the prefix {{IPA|/n/}} "around, in a loop".

&lt;/DIV&gt;

Carrier has multiple systems of [[noun class]]ification,&lt;ref&gt;Poser, William J. (2005) "Noun Classification in Carrier". ''Anthropological Linguistics'' 47.2.143-168.&lt;/ref&gt; several of which are realized on the verb. One of these, the system of absolutive or ''gender'' classifiers, consists of the prefixes {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/xʷ/}}, which indicate that the [[absolutive]] argument (the subject of an intransitive verb or the object of a transitive verb) is round, stick-like, or areal/spatial, respectively. Some verbs can take any or none of these prefixes. Others can take only a subset or none at all. For example, the verb "to be white" has the forms:
&lt;DIV align="center"&gt;
{| class="IPA wikitable"
|-
|{{IPA|ɬjəl}} || it (generic) is white
|-
|{{IPA|nəljəl}} || it (round) is white
|-
|{{IPA|dəljəl}} || it (stick-like) is white
|-
|{{IPA|xʷəljəl}} || it (areal/spatial) is white
|}
&lt;/DIV&gt;

==Syntax==
In general terms, Carrier is a head-final language: the [[verb]] comes at the end of the [[clause]], [[adposition]]s are [[postposition]]s rather than prepositions, and complementizers follow their clause. However, it is not consistently head-final: in head-external relative clauses, the [[relative clause]] follows the head noun. Carrier has both head-internal and head-external relative clauses. The [[subject (grammar)|subject]] usually precedes the object if one is present.

Carrier is an "everything drop" language. A verb can form a grammatical sentence by itself. It is not in general necessary for the subject or object to be expressed overtly by a noun phrase or [[pronoun]].

==Semantics==

===Scope phenomena===
Verb-internal negation has [[low scope]], meaning that, with certain exceptions, the scope of negation is restricted to the verb itself. Thus, a sentence like:

{{IPA|[ɬeʔzəstʼət]}} "I am not smoking (unspecified object)"

is acceptable since the object marker ([[underlyingly]] just {{IPA|/ʔ/}}, with epenthetic {{IPA|/ə/}} changed to {{IPA|[e]}} because it immediately precedes {{IPA|/ʔ/}} in the disjunct zone) is part of the verb, but

{{IPA|[dekʼa ɬəzəstʼət]}} "I am not smoking tobacco"

is bizarre because the object {{IPA|/dekʼa/}} "tobacco" is a separate noun phrase. The bizarreness results from the fact that the negative morphology of the verb does not have scope over the NP object. In order to bring the object within the scope of negation, it must follow the negative particle {{IPA|/ʔaw}}:

{{IPA|/ʔaw dekʼa ɬəzəstʼət/}} "I am not smoking tobacco"

==Classification==
Carrier is generally regarded as one of three members of the central British Columbia subgroup of [[Athabascan]], the other two being [[Babine-Witsuwit'en]] and [[Chilcotin language|Chilcotin]]. As noted above, the term "Carrier" has often been applied to both Carrier proper and [[Babine-Witsuwit'en]] but this identification is now rejected by specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Kari, James (1975) "Babine, a New Athabaskan Linguistic Grouping," ms. Alaska Native Language Center, Fairbanks, Alaska.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Story, Gillian L. (1984) Babine and Carrier Phonology: A Historically Oriented Study. Arlington, Texas: Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kari, James and Sharon Hargus (1989) "Dialectology, Ethnonymy and Prehistory in the Northwest Portion of the `Carrier' Language Area," ms. Alaska Native Language Center, Fairbanks, Alaska, and University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ethnologue]] treats Carrier proper as consisting of two languages, Carrier (code: crx) and [[Southern Carrier (language)|Southern Carrier]] (code: caf), where the latter consists of the dialects of the Ulkatcho, Kluskus, Nazko, and Red Bluff bands. More recent research disputes the treatment of "Southern Carrier" as a distinct language and in fact classifies this dialect group as one of two parts of a larger "Southern Carrier" dialect group that contains all of Carrier proper except for the Stuart/Trembleur Lake dialect. Southern Carrier in the sense of the Ethnologue, that is, the Blackwater dialect group, is mutually comprehensible with all other Carrier dialects.

==Dialects==
Current research divides Carrier into two major dialect groups, a ''Stuart-Trembleur'' Lake group, and a ''Southern'' group. The Southern group, in turn, is divided into two subgroups, the ''Fraser-Nechako'' group, comprising the communities of Cheslatta, Stellako, [[Nadleh Whut'en First Nation|Nadleh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| title = FirstVoices: Nadleh Whut'en Community Portal
| accessdate = 2012-10-19
| url = http://www.firstvoices.com/en/Nadleh-Whuten
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saik'uz, and Lheidli, and the ''Blackwater'' group, comprising the communities of Lhk'acho (Ulgatcho), Lhoosk'uz (Kluskus), Nazko,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| title = FirstVoices: Dakelh / Southern Carrier Community Portal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lhtakoh (Red Bluff).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ydli.org/dakinfo/dialects.htm Dakelh Dialects], Yinka Déné Language Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CarrierCommunities.jpg|thumb|left|The Carrier Region]]

Much of the literature distinguishes ''Central Carrier'' from ''Southern Carrier''. Unfortunately, the usage of these terms is quite variable. Almost all material in or about ''Central Carrier'' is in the Stuart Lake dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| title = FirstVoices: Nakʼazdli Dakelh Community Portal
| accessdate = 2012-10-19
| url = http://www.firstvoices.com/en/Nakazdli-Dakelh
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Central Carrier cannot be taken to be a synonym for Stuart-Trembleur Lake dialect because some of the more northerly of the Southern Carrier dialects, particularly Saik'uz dialect, are sometimes included in Central Carrier.

Although all speakers of all varieties of Carrier can communicate with each other with little difficulty, the dialects are quite diverse. They differ from each other not only in phonological details and lexicon but in morphology and even syntax.

==Contact with other languages==
Carrier is neighbored on the west by [[Babine-Witsuwit'en]] and [[Haisla Nation|Haisla]], to the north by [[Sekani]], to the southeast by [[Secwepemc|Shuswap]], to the south by [[Tsilhqot'in|Chilcotin]], and to the southwest by [[Nuxalk Nation|Nuxalk]]. Furthermore, in the past few centuries, with the westward movement of the [[Plains Cree]], there has been contact with the Cree from the East. Carrier has borrowed from some of these languages, but apparently not in large numbers. Loans from Cree include {{IPA|[məsdus]}} ('cow') from Cree (which originally meant "buffalo" but extended to "cow" already in Cree) and {{IPA|[sunija]}} ('money, precious metal'). There are also loans from languages that do not directly neighbor Carrier territory. A particularly interesting example is {{IPA|[maj]}} ('berry, fruit'), a loan from Gitksan, which has been borrowed into all Carrier dialects and has displaced the original Athabascan word.

[[Image:CarrierNeighbours.jpg|thumb|left|Carrier and the neighbouring languages]]

European contact has brought loans from a number of sources. The majority of demonstrable loans into Carrier are from French, though it is not generally clear whether they come directly from French or via [[Chinook Jargon]]. Loans from French include {{IPA|[liɡok]}} ('chicken') (from French ''le coq'' 'rooster'), {{IPA|[lisel]}} (from ''le sel'' 'salt'), and {{IPA|[lizas]}} ('angel'). As these examples show, the French article is normally incorporated into the Carrier borrowing. A single loan from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is known: {{IPA|[mandah]}} ('canvas, tarpaulin'), apparently acquired from Spanish-speaking packers.

The trade language [[Chinook Jargon]] came into use among Carrier people as a result of European contact. Most Carrier people never knew Chinook Jargon. It appears to have been known in most areas primarily by men who had spent time freighting on the [[Fraser River]]. Knowledge of Chinook Jargon may have been more common in the southwestern part of Carrier country due to its use at [[Bella Coola, British Columbia|Bella Coola]]. The southwestern dialects have more loans from Chinook Jargon than other dialects. For example, while most dialects use the Cree loan described above for "money", the southwestern dialects use {{IPA|[tʃikəmin]}}, which is from Chinook Jargon. The word {{IPA|[daji]}} ('chief') is a loan from Chinook Jargon.

European contact brought many new objects and ideas. The names for some were borrowed, but in most cases terms have been created using the morphological resources of the language, or by extending or shifting the meaning of existing terms. Thus, {{IPA|[tɬʼuɬ]}} now means not only "rope" but also "wire", while {{IPA|[kʼa]}} has shifted from its original meaning of "arrow" to mean "cartridge" and {{IPA|[ʔəɬtih]}} has shifted from "bow" to "rifle". {{IPA|[hutʼəp]}}, originally "leeches" now also means "pasta".
A microwave oven is referred to as {{IPA|[ʔa benəlwəs]}} ('that by means of which things are warmed quickly'). "Mustard" is {{IPA|[tsʼudənetsan]}} ('children's feces'), presumably after the texture and color rather than the flavor.

==Status==
Like most of the languages of [[British Columbia]], Carrier is an [[endangered language]]. Only about 10% of Dakelh people now speak the Carrier language, hardly any of them children. Members of the generation following that of the last speakers can often understand the language but they do not contribute to its transmission.

Carrier is taught as a second language in both public and band schools throughout Carrier territory. This instruction provides an acquaintance with the language but has not proven effective in producing functional knowledge of the language. Carrier has also been taught at the [[University of Northern British Columbia]], the [[College of New Caledonia]], and the [[University of British Columbia]].

The [[Yinka Dene Language Institute]] (YDLI) is charged with the maintenance and promotion of Carrier language and culture. Its activities include research, archiving, curriculum development, teacher training, literacy instruction, and production of teaching and reference materials.

Prior to the founding of YDLI in 1988 the [[Carrier Linguistic Committee]], a group based in [[Fort Saint James]] affiliated with the [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]], produced a number of publications in Carrier, literacy materials for several dialects, a 3000-entry dictionary of the Stuart Lake dialect,&lt;ref&gt;Antoine, Francesca, Bird, Catherine, Isaac, Agnes, Prince, Nellie, Sam, Sally, Walker, Richard, and David B. Wilkinson (1974) Central Carrier Bilingual Dictionary. Fort Saint James, British Columbia: Carrier Linguistic Committee.&lt;/ref&gt; and various other materials.

The Carrier Linguistic Committee is largely responsible for literacy among younger speakers of the language. The ''Carrier Bible Translation Committee'' produced a translation of the New Testament that was published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier Bible Translation Committee. 1995. Yak'usda Ooghuni: 'Andidi Khuni Neba Lhaidinla-i. Colorado Springs, Colorado: International Bible Society.&lt;/ref&gt; An adaptation to Blackwater dialect appeared in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier Bible Translation Committee. 2002. Yak'usda Bughunek: K'andit Khunek Neba Lhaidinla. Wycliffe Bible Translators.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Place names in Carrier==

"The first record of the Carrier language" in Gary Holton and Siri Tuttle (eds.) Working Papers in Athabaskan Languages. Fairbanks: Alaska Native Language Center. Working Papers #4.&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by a few Carrier words mentioned in the journal of [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] for the year 1806 and by a list of over 300 words given in an appendix to his journal by [[Daniel Williams Harmon|Daniel Harmon]], published in 1820. The first known text by native speakers of Carrier is the [[Barkerville Jail Text]] of 1885.

'''Chaha''' or '''Cheha''' (in Chaha and [[Amharic]]: ቸሃ ''čehā'' or ''čexā'') is a [[Gurage languages|Gurage]] language spoken in central [[Ethiopia]], mainly within the [[Gurage Zone]] in the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region]]. It is also spoken by [[Gurage people|Gurage]] settlers in Ethiopian cities, especially [[Addis Ababa]]. Chaha is known to many [[phonology|phonologists]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologists]] for its very complex [[morphophonology]].

==Speakers==
According to [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sgw Ethnologue], the dialects of SBG (Sebat Bet Gurage) are Chaha (''čäxa''), Ezha (''äža''), Gumer (or Gwemare, ''gʷämarä''), Gura, Gyeto (or Gyeta, ''gʸäta''), and Muher (or Mwahr, ''mʷäxǝr'').  However, some of these are sometimes considered languages in their own right.  In particular, Muher diverges so much from the other dialects that it is not necessarily even treated as a member of the Western Gurage group to which SBG belongs.{{ref|hetzron72}}

This article focuses on the Chaha dialect, which has been studied more than the others.
Unless otherwise indicated, all examples are Chaha.

==Sounds and orthography==

=== Consonants and vowels ===
SBG has a fairly typical set of phonemes for an [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopian Semitic]] language. There is the usual set of [[ejective consonant]]s as well as plain voiceless and voiced consonants. However, the Chaha language also has a larger set of [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] and [[labialization|labialized]] consonants than most other Ethiopian Semitic languages. Besides the typical seven vowels of these languages, SBG has [[open-mid vowel|open-mid]] front ({{IPA|ɛ}}) and back vowels ({{IPA|ɔ}}). Some of the dialects have both short and long vowel phonemes, and some have nasalized vowels.

The charts below show the phones of the Chaha dialect; exactly how many phonemes there are is a matter of controversy because of the complexity of SBG [[morphophonology]].{{ref|banksira}}
For the representation of SBG sounds, this article uses a modification of a system that is common (though not universal) among linguists who work on [[Ethiopic languages|Ethiopian Semitic languages]], but it differs somewhat from the conventions of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. When the IPA symbol is different, it is indicated in brackets in the
charts.

===Morphophonology===
In addition to the complexity in verb morphology characteristic of all [[Semitic language]]s, SBG exhibits another level of complexity because of the intricate relationship between the set of consonants in the [[triliteral|root]] of a verb and how they are realized in a particular form of that verb or a noun derived from that verb.
For example, the verb meaning 'open' has a root consisting of the consonants {''kft''} (as it does in most other Ethiopian Semitic languages).
In some forms we see all of these consonants.
For example, the third person singular masculine perfective Chaha form meaning 'he opened' is ''käfätä-m''.
However, when the impersonal of this same verb is used, meaning roughly 'he was opened', two of the stem consonants are changed: ''''kä'''fʷ'''ä'''č'''-i-m''''.

At least three different phonological processes play a role in SBG morphophonology.

====Devoicing and "gemination"====
In most Ethiopian Semitic languages, [[gemination]], that is, consonant lengthening, plays a role in distinguishing words from one another and in the grammar of verbs.

For example, in [[Amharic]], the second consonant of a three-consonant verb root is doubled in the perfective: {''sdb''} 'insult', ''sä'''dd'''äbä'' 'he insulted'. In Chaha and some other SBG dialects (but not Ezha or Muher), gemination is replaced by devoicing.  For example, the verb root meaning 'insult' is the same in SBG as in Amharic (with ''b'' replaced by ''β''), but in the perfective the second consonant becomes ''t'' in the non-geminating dialects: ''sä'''t'''äβä-m'' 'he insulted'.

Only voiced consonants can be devoiced: ''b/β'' → ''p'', ''d'' → ''t'', ''g'' → ''k'', ''bʷ'' → ''pʷ'', ''ǧ'' → ''č'', ''gʸ'' → ''kʸ'', ''gʷ'' → ''kʷ'', ''z'' → ''s'', ''ž'' → ''š''.

The "devoiced/geminated" form of ''r'' is ''n''.
Other voiced consonants are not devoiced.

====Labialization====
Several morphological processes cause consonants to be labialized (rounded).
For example, from the three-consonant verb root {''gkr''} 'be straight', there is the derived adjective '''''gʷ'''ǝ'''kʷ'''ǝr'' 'straight'.

Labial and velar consonants can be labialized: ''p'' → ''pʷ'', ''b'' → ''bʷ'', ''β'' → ''w'', ''f'' → ''fʷ'', ''k'' → ''kʷ'', ''ḳ'' → ''ḳʷ'', ''g'' → ''gʷ'', ''x'' → ''xʷ''.

====Palatalization, depalatalization====
Several morphological processes cause consonants to be palatalized.
For example, the second-person feminine singular form of verbs in the imperfective and jussive/imperative palatalizes one of the root consonants (if one is palatalizable): {''kft''} 'open', ''tǝkäf'''t''''' 'you (m.) open', ''tǝkäf'''č''''' 'you (f.) open'.

Dental and velar consonants can be palatalized: ''t'' → ''č'', ''ṭ'' → ''č̣'', ''d'' → ''ǧ'', ''s'' → ''š'', ''z'' → ''ž'', ''k'' → ''kʸ'', ''ḳ'' → ''ḳʸ'', ''g'' → ''gʸ'', ''x'' → ''xʸ''.

''r'' palatalizes to ''y''.

In one morphological environment the reverse process takes place.
In the imperative/jussive form of one class of verbs, the first consonant in the root is depalatalized if this is possible.
For example, the verb meaning 'return' (transitive) has the stem consonants {''žpr''} in other forms, for example, '''''ž'''äpärä-m'' 'he returned', but the ''ž'' is depalatalized  to ''z'' in the imperative '''''z'''äpǝr'' 'return! (m.)'.

===Allophones===
The relationship among ''n'', ''r'', and ''l'' is complex.  At least within verb stems, {{IPA|[n]}} and {{IPA|[r]}} may be treated as allophones of a single phoneme.  The consonant is realized as {{IPA|[n]}} at the beginning of the word, when this is a [[#Devoicing and "gemination"|"gemination"]] environment, and when it ends the penultimate syllable of the word.  {{IPA|[r]}} appears otherwise.
* '''''n'''ämädä-m'' 'he liked', ''tä-'''r'''ämädä-m'' 'he was liked'
* ''yǝ-βä'''r'''a'' 'he eats', ''bä'''n'''a-m'' 'he ate' ("geminated")
* ''sǝ'''r'''äpätä-m'' 'he spent some time', ''wä-sä'''m'''bǝt'' 'to spend some time' (the ''n'' becomes ''m'' because of the following ''b'')

Banksira also argues that ''k'' is an allophone of ''x'' and ''b'' an allophone of ''β''.{{ref|banksira}}

===Orthography===
Chaha is transcribed using the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez]] (Ethiopic) writing system. It was originally developed for the now-extinct [[Ge'ez language]], and now serves as the orthography for [[Amharic]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]. Although there are still relatively few texts in the language, three novels have appeared in the Chaha dialect (by Sahlä {{IPA|Səllase}} and Gäbräyäsus Haylämaryam).

To represent the palatalized consonants not found in Ge'ez, Amharic, or Tigrinya, modified characters were introduced to the script, such as using wedges on the tops. The original use of this was done in the [[New Testament]] published by the [[Ethiopian Bible Society]], then for the entire [[Bible]]; it has now become generally adopted.

'''Congressional Debate''' (also known as '''Student Congress''', '''Legislative Debate''') is a form of interscholastic [[high school]] [[debate]] in the [[United States]]. The [[National Speech and Debate Association]] (NSDA), [[National Catholic Forensic League]] (NCFL), many state associations and national invitational tournaments offer Congressional Debate as an event. Each organization and tournament offers its own rules, although the National Forensic League has championed standardization since 2007, when it began to ask its districts to use one of a number of procedures for qualification to its National Tournament.&lt;ref name="congressionaldebate.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congressionaldebate.org/|title=Congressional Debate|work=congressionaldebate.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Student Congress (Pakistan)|Pakistan Student Congress]] event is a conference, and not interscholastic competition.

In Congressional Debate, high school students emulate members of the [[United States Congress]] by debating [[bill (proposed law)|bills]] and resolutions. Before the event, each school submits mock legislation to each tournament. After the legislation has been compiled, it is distributed to each participating team. Each team attempts to research as many topics as possible, with the goal of being able to speak on both sides of every legislation.

== Legislation ==
Unlike other debate events, students drive the topics for discussion by drafting their own legislation for submission to tournaments. The bills and resolutions must be national in scope, and must either fall within jurisdiction for lawmaking by the United States Congress as a bill, or express a specific position and/or recommendation for further action outside of Congress' jurisdiction as a resolution. A popular type of resolution is to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, which requires action by state legislatures.

Tournaments may review legislation submitted before sharing the overall docket with all participating schools. Contestants from each school will research and prepare arguments both in favor and against each legislation in the docket before arriving at the tournament.

== Chambers and Sessions ==
Students attending each tournament are divided up into sections of 10-30 (usually 15-20). These individual rooms are called chambers, and sometimes labeled as a "House", or "Senate," depending on the region and the tournament.

During each phase of a tournament (preliminary and elimination), there is at least one round, often referred to as a "session." The National Forensic League defines a session as having:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.congressionaldebate.org/tutorials/how-tournaments-work&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ten minutes of time allocated for each student (average is three hours for 18-20 contestants)
* Election of a presiding officer
* New seating chart (necessary accommodations for students with special needs may be made)
* Resetting of precedence/recency
* New legislation that has not been debated in a previous session at that tournament
* The same contestants stay in one chamber, until the tournament advances to the next level of elimination.

While larger tournaments may have preliminary rounds that precede elimination rounds (semifinals, finals, etc.), smaller tournaments may not have elimination rounds and may recognize and award students in individual chambers.

=== Setting the Agenda ===
Rounds usually begin with a method for determining which bills will be debated and in which order, referred to as the agenda. This most commonly happens with a nominated agenda at the tournament, although some areas have a system of informal caucusing or highly organized committees, which convene to review legislation that has been subdivided by the tournament to address a specific topic area, such as is done in the National Catholic Forensic League&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncfl.org/competition/studentcongress/assets/NCFLStudentCongressManual.pdf National Catholic Forensic League Student Congress Manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926194914/http://ncfl.org/competition/studentcongress/assets/NCFLStudentCongressManual.pdf |date=2010-09-26 }}, 1996 Edition, pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; and Illinois Congressional Debate Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edline.net/pages/ICDA|title=Illinois Congressional Debate Association|work=edline.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common committee structure includes: "[[Public welfare]]", "[[Economics]]," and "[[International relations|Foreign Affairs]]."

=== Speeches ===
Congressional Debate speeches last up to three minutes. The first speech on each legislation, known as the "authorship," goes to a debater who wrote the legislation, or from the same school of the author.  If nobody from the author's school is present, another debater gives a sponsorship speech, which is functionally identical to an authorship. This first speech is followed by a two-minute questioning period. One three-minute speech in opposition (negation) follows it,  with another mandatory two minutes of questioning. After these initial speeches, debate alternates in favor and opposition to the legislation with three-minute speeches and one minute of questioning. Within each speech, contestants develop two or three organized, logical arguments supported by credible evidence for why the chamber should vote for or against the given legislation. The general format of a speech is as follows:
# '''Introduction''': Usually, speeches begin with some sort of attention-getting device, such as a quotation (which could be humorous, shocking, or sad) or statistic. The introduction is tied to the central thesis of the speech, as the speaker urges the chamber to vote in support or opposition. Sometimes, the two or three main lines of argument are previewed to give the audience an idea of where the speech is leading; however, some criticize this practice as a waste of limited time.
# '''Contentions''': Two or three arguments for or against the legislation. Each contention should be explained in the speaker's own words and supported by evidence from reputable and relevant sources.
# '''Conclusion''': The speaker often restates his 2 or 3 contentions and returns to the attention-getting device from the introduction to give the speech thematic unity. Alternatively, conclusions can consist of merely 1 or 2 sentences, such as "For these reasons you must pass/defeat this bill/resolution/legislation."

==== Questioning ====
Questioning, traditionally, has been the standard set by the debate rules. One speaker at a time has an opportunity to ask one question at a time, moderated by the presiding officer. Typically, questions attempt to expose faults in the speech given. Sometimes speakers upholding the same side as the current speaker will ask a "friendly question," seeking agreement, although in some regions, this is discouraged. Questions, and their respective answers, are to be short and to the point, as delays will unfairly cut into other speakers' questioning time.

Rules do not allow for "prefacing," where students formulate a statement or argument as part of their question; rather, they must simply ask a question, and only a question.

The debate rules also provides for direct questioning, if the standing rules of the organization allow for it, where the speaker and questioner can engage in direct dialogue without moderation from the chair. This is done in 30- or 60-second blocks of time, allowing the questioner to engage the floor speaker to greater depth. This is used to sometimes build arguments that the questioner uses in a later speech, similar to cross-examination in other competitive debate events. At tournaments where this is practiced, the presiding officer is either required or strongly advised to keep a separate questioning priority, to ensure equal opportunity for questioners. Several tournaments have piloted this method since the National Forensic League suggested this as a result of discussions with its Congressional Debate Rules and Recommendations Committee in 2009.

Some leagues and tournaments still use a protocol where the balanced of unused speaking time is reserved for questioning, rather than having a specific period.

While some student questioners feel the need to ask if the speaker yields, this is unnecessary under procedure, because the standing rules of the organizations and tournaments provide specific parameters for questioning periods that already establish when questioning begins.

== Procedure and Presiding Officers ==
While all Congressional Debate competition rely upon [[parliamentary procedure]] as practiced in Congress (i.e. the [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate]] or the [[Procedures of the United States House of Representatives]]) as the underpinning for how sessions are conducted, there may be slight variations in how the competition itself is run. Each chamber has a presiding officer (PO) or chair. At the beginning of each session, contestants in the chamber nominate candidates. Usually, each nominee gives a brief candidacy speech introducing themselves and stating their qualifications. Contestants then elect a presiding officer by majority via individual, secret balloting.

The presiding officer's job is to facilitate fair, balanced, and efficient debate during the session in which they have been elected, primarily through recognition of speakers and questioners (see section below). At the end of many tournaments students in the chamber vote on which presiding officer was the best, and some tournaments have a separate means for judge recognition of presiding officers.

The most common duties of the presiding officer are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.congressionaldebate.org/tutorials/presiding&lt;/ref&gt;
* recognizing speakers
* recognizing contestants to ask questions of speakers
* recognizing contestants to move motions
* timing speeches (often done with an audible gavel signal)
* conducting votes on motions, including legislation
* keeping order in the chamber

=== Speaker Recognition ===
The presiding officer always calls for an author or sponsor for the first legislation in order, and the author always gets first right of refusal. When a session starts, there usually are not predetermined methods for selecting contestants for their first speech. Once speakers have been recognized, the universal rule in all leagues and tournaments is to first recognize those who have not spoken, or those who have spoken least (referred to as "precedence"). Beyond that, the National Forensic League and common practice have dictated that students also consider who spoke earlier (referred to as "recency"). Before precedence and recency are established, the presiding officer must recognize speakers fairly and equitably. The National Forensic League and many tournaments have (as of 2012) ruled the use of methods that tie the number of questions asked or motions made to speaker recognition, as well as how many times a student has stood, out of order, because they result in competitors simply "playing the game".

Often, coaches will instruct students who preside to call on contestants for early speeches that they do not know, and/or who are less experienced. Additionally, since debate becomes more complex after more arguments have been introduced, later speakers bear a higher burden for clash and refutation.

In some areas, before precedence and recency are established, priority cards are distributed or numbers are designated to each student, giving the presiding officer a clear and objective directive as to whom to recognize. This has been criticized by longtime National Forensic League Congress Coordinator Harold Keller for entirely removing the dynamism of the activity from students' hands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalforensicleague.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001051938/http://www.nationalforensicleague.org/ |date=2013-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motions ===

The National Forensic League's Table of Parliamentary Motions is in use by almost every organization that conducts Congressional Debate competition, including the National Catholic Forensic League.&lt;ref name="congressionaldebate.org" /&gt; The motions are similar, if not usually identical to those used in Congress with a few exceptions, including the one-thirds second required to amend a motion or legislation, to prevent abuse of that protocol.

The presiding officer never should call for motions; rather, contestants should rise and say "motion," and then that they move a specific motion.

==== Frequently Used Parliamentary Motions ====

The following motions are used at almost all Congressional Debate tournaments:

{| border="1"
!Motion !! Notes!! Second Required !! Fraction of Chamber Required
|-
|To open the floor to debate* || Also called the "main motion" || Yes || Majority
|-
|To take a bill from the table || Re-opens debate on tabled legislation, which may or may not have already been debated || Yes || Majority
|-
|To lay a bill on the table || Pauses debate on a bill. Some states typically return to vote on all tabled items before the conclusion of a tournament, but there is no rule requiring this.|| Yes || Majority
|-
|To call the previous question || To call the "previous question" ends debate on a bill and states the main motion to vote on it || Yes || 2/3
|-
|To recess || The time of the recess (e.g. "for ten minutes" or "until 11:30") must be specified || Yes || Majority
|-
|To rise to a point of personal privilege || To make a personal request || No || Decision of chair
|-
|To rise to a point of order/parliamentary procedure || To correct a parliamentary error, ask a question, or clarify a procedure|| No || Decision of chair
|-
|To amend || Modifies a pending motion or the pending bill/resolution; filled-out slip must be passed to P.O. in advance || 1/3 second triggers debate on the amendment || 2/3 majority to call the previous question to end debate, then majority to pass.
|-
|To adjourn|| Made at the end of a tournament|| Yes || Majority
|}

&lt;small&gt;* Widely recognized to be an unnecessary motion. The rule in Congress states that the floor is opened by the presiding officer, not by a motion coming from the chamber.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX|title = Debate – Rules of the Senate|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-03|website = www.rules.senate.gov|publisher = United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://rules.house.gov/resources|title = Resources|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-03|website = rules.house.gov/resources|publisher = United States House of Representatives Committee on Rules|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These motions are allowed at some Congressional Debate tournaments, depending on the region and the style of debate:

{| border="1"
!Motion !! Notes!! Second Required !! Fraction of Chamber Required
|-
|To demand a roll call vote || Used to verify a voice vote or vote by show-of-hands. || Yes || 1/5
|-
|To "Divide the House" || Used to verify a voice vote || No || No (demand by a single member requires a re-count)
|-
|To modify or withdraw a motion || To change or take back a motion that has not yet passed || Yes, only if chair has already stated the motion || Majority (after motion is stated by chair), no vote required if motion has not been stated.
|-
|To suspend the rules || To take an action against rules (such as adding another minute of questioning) || Yes || 2/3
|-
|To appeal a decision of the chair || Allows chamber to overrule the PO's ruling on a prior point of order || Yes || Majority
|-
|To extend questioning time (by a stated time)* || To continue asking questions of the speaker || Yes || 2/3
|}

This requires a suspension of the rules.*

==== Main Motion ====
The term "main motion" refers to the primary question before the assembly; in Congressional Debate, this is the legislation as presented on the agenda, so it is never necessary for a contestant to specifically move the main motion. Main motions can be changed or affected by a variety of subsidiary motions.

The following motions end debate on the pending main motion:
* Previous question (ends debate and moves to voting on the legislation).
* Lay on the Table (pauses debate until a motion to take from the table passes).
* Recess (pauses debate for the specified duration of the recess, debate resumes automatically on return)
* Adjourn (ends debate on the pending item and any items left on the table; any item not passed automatically fails without a vote)

Only one main motion is in order at any given time.  If the chamber wishes to change to another legislation while another is still being considered, the chamber must end debate (which could include pausing debate by laying on the table) before changing to the desired item. Some tournaments establish a minimum time before the previous question can be moved; others limit how long each legislation may be debated. When debate gets one-sided, or "stale," often a contestant will rise and move the previous question, which requires two-thirds of the chamber concurring. If this motion fails, the presiding officer should rule any immediate subsequent motion to "lay on the table" (requiring a simple majority vote) out of order, since that is an abusive way to circumvent the spirit of the rules to allow the minority a voice before majority rules.

==== Voting ====
After the previous question has been moved, the presiding officer calls for a vote on the legislation, and after counting votes, announces whether the ayes or noes have it, and the motion carries or is defeated. Note that "yay" and "nay" are archaic modes of voting expression that are no longer used in parliamentary parlance.

It is commonplace for students to move a recess following voting.

==== Amendments ====
Amendments are an important tool that can add nuance and perspective to debate on a particular issue, even though they are not practiced as often as they once were. To amend, a student will submit the amendment in writing to the head table (often rising to a point of personal privilege and seeking permission to approach the rostrum). The presiding officer (often in consultation with the parliamentarian) will first determine if the amendment is germane; or if it changes the original intent of the legislation, it is ruled dilatory. The author of the amendment then moves to amend, and if the presiding officer rules it germane, they read it aloud to the chamber and calls for a one-thirds second (usually by voice vote). If one-third of the chamber concurs to consider the amendment, the presiding officer then calls for a speech in support of the amendment. At most tournaments, the speech introducing or sponsoring the amendment is not guaranteed to its author, and in fact, it is common practice in some areas for a contestant to immediately move the previous question on the amendment. If that happens, it is not debated before the chamber passes or defeats the amendment. If the amendment passes, subsequent debate on the legislation must consider the legislation as amended.

== Judging ==

Judges either serve as a scorers or parliamentarians. Scorers judge individual sessions
# Evaluate individual speeches, awarding speaker points (usually on a 1-6 scale)
# Evaluate the presiding officer, awarding speaker points (usually on a 1-6 scale)
# Holistically rank the judge's eight most preferred contestants, considering the presiding officer for inclusion or exclusion among those eight.

=== Evaluating Speeches ===
While judging a speech is clearly, to a certain extent, subjective, there are certain key standards that distinguish effectiveness:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://congressionaldebate.org/tutorials/judging-standards | title=Judging Standards | accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Originality of Thought''': advances debate rather than repeats previously stated ideas; refutes opposing arguments.
* '''Organization and Unity''': cohesively links ideas.
* '''Evidence and Logic''': cites credible sources, connecting to claims.
* '''Delivery''': extemporaneous speaking vs. reciting a manuscript, seriousness of purpose, style and poise.
* '''Questioning''': how well the debater defends her/his position and claims made.

=== Evaluating Presiding Officers ===
The presiding officer always is taken into consideration for recognition in the chamber by judges (usually through ranking at the end of the session), and some tournaments have both the scorers and parliamentarian evaluate the presiding officer, while others just have one or the other do so.  The following key standards distinguish effectiveness:{{cite web | url=http://congressionaldebate.org/tutorials/judging-standards | title=Judging Standards | accessdate=March 22, 2013}}
* '''Parliamentary Procedure''': clearly explains protocols and procedures.
* '''Recognition''': fairly and efficiently recognizes speakers and questioners, maintains appropriate speaker precedence and recency, and avoids "activity," "longest standing/standing time."
* '''Control''': maintains decorum of delegates, and willing to rule motions out of order.
* '''Demeanor''': fosters a respectful, professional, and collegial atmosphere.
* '''Communication''': overall use of language, avoiding unnecessary verbiage.

=== Parliamentarian ===
In addition to judges who score speeches, most tournaments have a parliamentarian in each chamber. Unlike scorers, who generally rotate each session, the parliamentarian remains in one chamber for all sessions (preliminary, semifinal or final). The parliamentarian's role is a fairly passive one; their main purpose is to serve as a reference on parliamentary procedure in case there is confusion or a dispute the presiding officer cannot resolve. Unless either the presiding officer makes (or fails to correct) a major error in procedure or else the debate gets bogged down the parliamentarian will generally not intervene in the proceedings unless asked by someone in the chamber.

In Utah,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} the presiding officer appoints a member of the chamber to act as parliamentarian. This student keeps record of speaking priority/recency for the chair. The student parliamentarian is considered a member of the body and continues to participate, and because of the appointed nature of the office, it is not counted as a speech. The parliamentarian serves at the chair's pleasure, and there are often occasions  the chair will not appoint a parliamentarian, rather, handling duties her/himself.

== History ==
The first high school Congress was held in 1938 by the National Forensic League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalforensicleague.org/aspx/nav.aspx?navid=195&amp;pnavid=195 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316110815/http://nationalforensicleague.org/aspx/nav.aspx?navid=195&amp;pnavid=195 |archivedate=2013-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other forms of debate, it emphasizes clash of ideas, and consideration of questions of policy (bills) and value (resolutions). It operates like a forensic speech event with sectioning of multiple entries per section and comparative ranking and rating by points (as opposed to pairing just two entries and wins/losses).  Since 2000, the event has been growing nationwide, added by several states as State Tournament event, and added to numerous large invitational tournaments.

=== National Trends ===
In the past decade, Congressional Debate has spread widely across the debate community. The first major tournament outside of NFL and NCFL nationals to hold Congressional Debate was the Harvard University Tournament traditionally held near President's Day weekend in February. Other major tournaments which host congress competitions include The Barkley Forum for High Schools at Emory University, The University of Florida Blue Key, Yale, Princeton, the Villiger tournament in Philadelphia, the Glenbrooks tournament in Chicago, the Crestian Classic in Florida, Pennsbury, Princeton, George Mason, the Minneapple Debate Tournament in Minnesota, Stanford, the California Invitational at UC Berkeley, and the Sunvitational in Florida. In addition, Congress is now one of the official events at the debate Tournament of Champions, hosted by the University of Kentucky. Students who achieve a high level of competitive success at other national tournaments qualify to compete at the TOC, which brings together some of the best congresspersons from across the nation. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728065654/http://studentcongressdebate.org/component/docman/doc_download/18-toc-congressional-debate-results-2010] The nomenclature of "congressional debate" is also the result of a shift in recent times toward a more debate-oriented category. In the past, the category focused more on simulating the Congress through oratory skills, hence the name "student congress." The trend is to strike a balance between eloquent speech and reasoned debate.

[[Image:Latin alphabet Đđ.svg|right|250px]]

'''Đ''' (lowercase: '''đ''', [[Latin alphabet]]), known as '''crossed D''' or '''dyet''', is a letter formed from the base character [[D]]/d overlaid with a [[bar (diacritic)|crossbar]]. Crossing was used to create [[eth]] (ð), but eth has an [[uncial]] as its base whereas ''đ'' is based on the straight-backed roman ''d''. Crossed ''d'' is a letter in the alphabets of several languages and is used in [[linguistics]] as a [[phonetic transcription|phonetic symbol]].

== Appearance ==
[[File:Dbarbowl.svg|frame|right|Barred ''d'', with crossbar through the bowl.]]

In the lowercase, the crossbar is usually drawn through the [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]], but when used as a phonetic symbol it may be preferred to draw it through the [[bowl (typography)|bowl]], in which case it is known as a barred ''d''.&lt;ref name="unicode"&gt;{{cite book |author=The Unicode Consortium |year=2003 |title=The Unicode Standard, Version 4.0 |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Addison-Wesley Developers Press |page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some African languages' orthographies, such as that of [[Moro language|Moro]], the barred ''d'' is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n2847.pdf ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2/WG 2  Revised Proposal to Encode Additional Latin Orthographic Character JTC1/SC2/WG2 N2847R]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the uppercase, the crossbar normally crosses just the left stem, but in Vietnamese and Moro it may sometimes cross the entire letter.&lt;ref name="Le Ba Khanh"&gt;Example: {{cite book|author=Lê Bá Khanh|author2=Lê Bá Kông|title=Vietnamese-English/English-Vietnamese Dictionary|edition=7th printing|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Hippocrene Books]]|year=1991|isbn=0-87052-924-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spanish de ligature.svg|thumb|right|100px|Ligature DE.]]
The ''DE'' ligature should not be confused with the ''Đ''. That ligature was used stylistically in pre-19th century Spanish as a contraction for ''de'', as a D with an E superimposed. For example, ''Universidad &lt;span style="font-feature-settings: 'hlig' on"&gt;DE&lt;/span&gt; Guadalajara''.

== Uses by language ==

[[File:Constellations9thcentury(p.31)Text2.png|thumb|left|upright|A 9th century Latin manuscript. The abbreviation '''{{lang|la|ſcđo}}''' ({{lang|la|secundo}}, "second") occurs on the third line.]]

=== African languages ===
A lowercase ''đ'' appeared alongside a lowercase [[African D|retroflex D]] in a 1982 revision of the [[African reference alphabet]]. This revision of the alphabet eliminated uppercase forms, so there was no conflict between ''ɖ'' and ''đ''.

=== Latin ===
''Đ'' was used in [[Medieval Latin]] to mark [[abbreviation]]s of words containing the letter ''d''. For example, {{lang|la|hđum}} could stand for {{lang|la|h&lt;u&gt;ere&lt;/u&gt;dum}} "of the heirs". Similar crossbars were added to other letters to form abbreviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bischoff |first=Bernhard |year=1990 |title=Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Slavic languages&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Serbian language]] --&gt; ===

The crossed ''d'' was introduced by Serbian [[philologist]] [[Đuro Daničić]] in 1878 for use in [[Serbo-Croatian]] in his ''Dictionary of the Croatian or Serbian Language'', replacing the older digraphs ''dj'' and ''gj''.&lt;ref name="Maretić"&gt;Maretić, Tomislav. ''Gramatika i stilistika hrvatskoga ili srpskoga književnog jezika'', p. 14-15. 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; Daničić modeled the letter after the [[Icelandic alphabet|Icelandic]] or [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] letter [[eth]], albeit representing a different sound, the [[affricate]] {{IPAblink|dʑ}}.&lt;ref name="Maretić" /&gt; In 1892 it was officially introduced in [[Croatia]]n and [[Slavonia]]n schools (in the [[Habsburg]] [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] where the [[Croatian language]] was official) and so definitively added to [[Gaj’s Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref name="Maretić" /&gt; The letter thereafter gradually entered daily use,&lt;ref name="Maretić" /&gt; spreading throughout [[Serbo-Croatian]] and then to [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] (its Latin transliterations heavily influenced by Serbo-Croatian from the Yugoslav period).

The crossed ''d'' is today considered a distinct letter, and is placed between [[Dž]] and [[E]] in [[alphabetical order]]. Its [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] equivalent is [[Ђ|Ђ ђ]].&lt;ref name="Maretić" /&gt; Its partial equivalent in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] is [[Ѓ|Ѓ ѓ]] (because only some dialects contain the {{IPA|/dʑ/}} sound). When a true ''đ'' is not available or desired, it is [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] as ''dj'' in modern Serbo-Croatian, and as ''gj'' in Macedonian. The use of ''dj'' in place of ''đ'' used to be more common in Serbo-Croatian texts, but is now considered obsolete and discouraged by style guides.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[Image:Wright germanic spirants.gif|350px|thumb|right|An example of '''đ''' being used for a voiced dental fricative in the [[phonetic transcription]] of early [[Germanic languages]], alongside [[ƀ]] for [[voiced bilabial fricative|bilabial]] and [[ʒ]] for [[voiced velar fricative|velar]], from [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]]'s ''Old High German Primer'' (1906).]]

=== Sami languages ===
In the present-day orthographies of [[Northern Sami language|Northern Sami]], [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]] and [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]], ''đ'' represents the fricative {{IPAblink|ð}}. It is considered a distinct letter and placed between [[D]] and [[E]] in [[alphabetical order]].

=== Vietnamese ===
[[File:Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum.pdf|page=95|thumb|right|upright|A page from the '''đ''' section of de Rhodes's {{lang|la|Dictioniarum Annamiticum}}, a 1651 Vietnamese-Portuguese-Latin dictionary. As with the [[B with flourish]], Đ only appears in lowercase in de Rhodes's works.]]

''Đ'' is the seventh letter of the [[Vietnamese alphabet]], after ''D'' and before ''E''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bài Tập Tại Nhà #1|trans-title=Homework Practice #1|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Lạc Hồng Vietnamese Language School|page=1|date=August 7, 2009|accessdate=November 17, 2013|url=http://www.vscso.org/lachong/Classes/2007/Cap2A/Bai%20Tap%20Tai%20Nha%201%20-%20Hoc%20on.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, digraphs and trigraphs like ''CH'' and ''NGH'' were considered letters as well, making ''Đ'' the eighth letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tài Liệu Cho Giáo Viên|trans-title=Teaching Materials|publisher=La Vang Vietnamese Language School|date=October 28, 2011|accessdate=November 18, 2013|page=1|url=http://truongvietngu.cdmelavang.com/downloads/TaiLieuGVFall2011.pdf|format=PDF|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Đ'' is a letter in its own right, rather than a ligature or letter-diacritic combination; therefore, ''đá'' would come after ''dù'' in any alphabetical listing.

''Đ'' represents a [[voiced alveolar implosive]] ({{IPA|/ɗ/}}) or, according to [[Laurence Thompson|Thompson]] (1959), a [[Glottalization|preglottalized]] [[voiced alveolar stop]] ({{IPA|/ʔd/}}).&lt;ref name="Thompson 1959"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Laurence|authorlink=Laurence Thompson|title=Saigon phonemics|journal=[[Language (journal)|Language]]|publisher=[[Linguistic Society of America]]|volume=35|issue=3|year=1959|pages=458–461|doi=10.2307/411232|jstor=411232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas ''D'' is pronounced as some sort of dental or alveolar stop in most Latin alphabets, an unadorned ''D'' in Vietnamese represents either {{IPA|/z/}} (Hanoian) or {{IPA|/j/}} (Saigonese).

The Vietnamese alphabet was formally described for the first time in the 17th-century text {{lang|la|Manuductio ad Linguam Tunckinensem}}, attributed to a Portuguese Jesuit missionary, possibly [[Francisco de Pina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Portuguese Pioneers of Vietnamese Linguistics|first=Roland|last=Jacques|location=Bangkok|publisher=Orchid Press|year=2002|isbn=9748304779}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Filipe Sibin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gesammelte Studien|series=Bibliotheca Instituti Historici S.I.|publisher=[[Jesuit Historical Institute]]|year=1963|volume=21|page=12|language=Portuguese|quote=…e a «&amp;nbsp;Manuductio ad linguam Tunckinensem&amp;nbsp;» do Padre Filipe Sibin SI…}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage about the letter ''Đ'' was later incorporated into [[Alexandre de Rhodes]]' seminal {{lang|la|[[Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum]]}}:&lt;ref name="Hon Viet"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alexandre de Rhodes có phải là cha đẻ của chữ Quốc ngữ?|trans-title=Was Alexandre de Rhodes the father of the Vietnamese alphabet?|author=Nguyễn Minh Hoàng|magazine=Hồn Việt|accessdate=November 17, 2013|url=http://honvietquochoc.com.vn/bai-viet/3028-alexandre-de-rhodes-co-phai-la-cha-de-cua-chu-quoc-ngu.aspx|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Another letter written with the symbol đ is completely different than our own and is pronounced by raising the tip of the tongue to the palate of the mouth, immediately removing it, without in any way touching the teeth, for example ''đa đa'': partridge.

On older typewriters, {{key press|Đ}} was located where {{key press|Z}} would be in the French [[AZERTY]] layout.&lt;ref&gt;{{flickr-inline2|photos/13712099@N05/1503345730/|VietNamese Typewriter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a hyphen can be [[Overstrike|overstruck]] onto a D.

On computers without support for a Vietnamese [[character set]] or [[Unicode]], ''Đ'' is encoded as &lt;code&gt;DD&lt;/code&gt; and ''đ'' as &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; according to the [[Vietnamese Quoted-Readable]] standard. Vietnamese computer users typically input ''Đ'' as {{key press|D}}{{key press|D}} in the [[Telex (IME)|Telex]] and VIQR input methods or as {{key press|D}}{{key press|9}} in the [[VNI]] input method. In the absence of an input method, the [[TCVN 6064:1995]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] Vietnamese keyboard layouts map ZA0-09 ({{key press|0}} on a U.S. keyboard) to ''đ'', or ''Đ'' when holding down {{key press|shift}}. The Windows layout also maps ZA0-11 ({{key press|1==}}) to ₫.

Other modes of communication also have dedicated representations of ''Đ''. In [[Vietnamese Braille]], it is {{Braille cell|145}}, which corresponds to ''D'' in [[French Braille]]. In the [[Vietnamese sign languages|Vietnamese manual alphabet]], ''Đ'' is produced by touching the thumb to the index finger. In [[Morse code]], it is rendered –&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;·, corresponding to Telex's "DD".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morse Code|location=Alberquerque, New Mexico|publisher=Our Lady of La Vang Eucharistic Youth Society|year=2011|accessdate=October 12, 2014|url=http://tntt.lavangnm.org/morsecode.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==

=== Phonetic transcription ===

The lowercase ''đ'' is used in some [[phonetic transcription]] schemes to represent a [[voiced dental fricative]] {{IPA|[ð]}} (English ''th'' in '''''th'''is''). [[Eth]] (ð) is more commonly used for this purpose, but the crossed ''d'' has the advantage of being able to be typed on a standard [[typewriter]], by overlaying a [[hyphen]] over a ''d''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pullum |first=Geoffrey K. |authorlink=Geoffrey K. Pullum |author2=Ladusaw, William A. |year=1996 |title=[[Phonetic Symbol Guide]] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Currency symbols ===

A minuscule form of the letter, đ, is the symbol of the [[Vietnamese đồng|đồng]], the currency of Vietnam, by a 1953 decree by [[Ho Chi Minh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sắc lệnh của Chủ tịch Nước Việt Nam Dân chủ Cộng hòa số 162/SL|trans-title=Decree number 162/SL of the President of Vietnam|author=Ho Chi Minh|authorlink=Ho Chi Minh|publisher=[[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]|date=May 20, 1953|url=http://moj.gov.vn/vbpq/Lists/Vn%20bn%20php%20lut/View_Detail.aspx?ItemID=1119|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South Vietnamese đồng]], on the other hand, was symbolized "Đ.", in majuscule. In Unicode, the Vietnamese đồng symbol is properly represented by {{unichar|20ab|Dong sign}}, but {{unichar|0111|Latin small letter D with stroke}} is often used instead. In Vietnamese, the đồng sign is written after the amount in superscript, often underlined.

The uppercase [[eth]] (Ð) is also now used to symbolize the [[cryptocurrency]] [[Dogecoin]]. The idea originated in December 2013 on the website [[Reddit]] when a user realized that the symbol wasn't currently being used for any other [[currency]], and the community believed it was fitting for Dogecoin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sv0co/proposed_dogecoin_symbol_ð/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemistry ===

[[Dispersity]] is represented by the symbol Đ, and is a measure of the heterogeneity of sizes of molecules or particles in a mixture, referring to either molecular mass or degree of polymerization.

== Computer encoding ==
''Đ'' and ''đ'' are encoded in [[Unicode]] as U+0110 &lt;small&gt;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH STROKE&lt;/small&gt; and U+0111 &lt;small&gt;LATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH STROKE&lt;/small&gt;; in [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|Latin-2]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-4|Latin-4]] and [[ISO/IEC 8859-16|Latin-10]] as D0 and F0 respectively; and, in [[ISO/IEC 8859-10|Latin-6]] as A9 and B9 respectively. In [[PostScript]] they are Dcroat, Dmacron, Dslash, dcroat, dmacron and dslash. In Unicode, both crossed ''d'' and barred ''d'' are considered [[glyph variant]]s of U+0111.&lt;ref name="unicode"/&gt;

Unicode has a distinct code point for the visually very similar capital [[eth]], Ð, U+00D0, which can lead to confusion.

As part of [[WGL4]], ''Đ'' and ''đ'' can be expected to display correctly even on older Windows systems.

'''Duisburg dialect''' ({{lang-de|Duisburger Platt}}, {{IPA-de|ˈdyːsbʊɐ̯ɡɐ ˌplat|pron}}; Duisburg dialect: ''Düsbergsch Platt'') was part of the southeasternmost form of the [[South Guelderish]] [[dialect]] (Cleverlands) within the 
[[Low Franconian languages]]. 
South Guelderish refers to the easternmost group of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] dialects spoken along the lower Rhine in Germany and the Netherlands.
Duisburg dialect was spoken in the German city of [[Duisburg]]. Through historical circumstances it became broadly influenced by the Central German language.

The Uerdingen Line (named after the city of [[Uerdingen]]) is the linguistic [[isogloss]] within the continental [[West Germanic languages]] in Europe that separates dialects which preserve the -k sound in the first person singular pronoun word "ik" (north of the line) from dialects in which the word final -k has changed to word final -ch in the word "ich" ({{IPA|ç}}) (south of the line). That sound shift is the one that progressed the farthest north among the consonant shifts that characterize [[High German]] and [[Low German]]/[[Low German|Low Saxon]] dialects. The line passes through Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.

The dialect, north of the Uerdingen Line, is now regarded as extinct. As a spoken language, it died out between the 1950s and 1970s.
A so-called [[Ruhr]]/[[Lower Rhine]] area dialect with traces of the old dialect in grammar, syntax and vocabulary is spoken in the Duisburg region.

== Examples ==

Duisburg dialect:
: Wellem van der Weppe wor all fis op Johre, as hä sech en Frau nohm. Hä wor ömmer
: en betzke vörsechtig en allem.
: „Jezz bös do noch los on ledig,“ sagg hä sich, as hä fiefonvertig Johr old wor,
: „on wezz, wat do häss, ävver wat do kriggs, wenn do dich en Frau an den Hals
: hängs, dat wezz do noch lang nit!“


Dutch:
: Wellem van der Weppe was al jaren oud als hij een vrouw nam. Hij was altijd
: een beetje voorzichtig in alle dingen.
: „Nu ben je nog los en ongehuwd“, zei hij als hij vijfenvertig jaar oud was,
: „en je weet wat je hebt, maar wat je krijgt als je je een vrouw op de hals haalt,
: dat weet je nog lang niet!“


English:
: Wellem van der Weppe was years old when he took a wife. He has always been
: a bit cautious in all matters.
: „Now I am free and unmarried“, he said when he was fifty-four years old.
: „now I know what I have, but what I will get when I am saddled with a wife, 
: that I do not know by far yet!“


German:
: Wilhelm van der Weppe war schon alt an Jahren, als er sich eine Frau nahm. Er war immer
: ein bisschen vorsichtig in allem.
: „Jetzt bist du noch frei und ledig,“ sagte er sich, als er fünfundvierzig Jahre alt war,
: „und weißt, was du hast, aber was du bekommst, wenn du dir eine Frau an den Hals
: hängst, das weißt du noch lang nicht!“

'''Eastern Middle Atlas Berber''' is a cluster of [[Berber languages|Berber dialects]] spoken in the eastern and north-eastern parts of the [[Middle Atlas]], in [[Morocco]]. These dialects are those of the tribes of Aït Seghrushen, Aït Waraïn, Marmusha, Aït Alaham, Aït Yub and Aït Morghi.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annales de géographie]]: bulletin de la Société de géographie, Volume 33, p.275 (A. Colin, 1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourrilly"&gt;J. Bourrilly, Éléments d'éthnographie marocaine, p.42 (Larose, 1932)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. S. Colin, [http://i55.servimg.com/u/f55/14/67/35/08/bbscan54.jpg Carte linguistique du Maroc] (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that they are [[mutually intelligible]] with neighbouring [[Central Atlas Tamazight]] dialects and are generally classified among them, these dialects actually belong to the [[Zenati languages]] and are intermediate dialects between the [[Riffian language|Riffian]] and [[Atlas languages|Atlas]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;Revue d'ethnographie et des traditions populaires, Volume 2, p.68 (Société française d'ethnographie, 1921)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kossmann"&gt;M.

Kossmann, [https://www.academia.edu/8902056/Berber_subclassification_preliminary_version_ Berber subclassification (preliminary version, unpublished)], pp.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Among these Zenati dialects, those of ''[[Ait Seghrouchen Berber|Aït Seghrouchen]]'' and ''Aït Waraïn'' were subject to most studies, while only a few studies were focused on the dialects of ''Aït Alaham'' and ''Marmusha'', and practically none focused on the dialects of ''Aït Yub'' and ''Aït Morghi''.

An '''endangered language''', or '''moribund language''', is a [[language]] that is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers [[Language death|die out]] or [[language shift|shift]] to speaking another language. [[Language loss]] occurs when the language has no more native speakers and becomes a "[[dead language]]". If no one can speak the language at all, it becomes an "[[extinct language]]". A dead language may still be studied through recordings or writings, but it is still dead or extinct unless there are [[Fluency|fluent]] speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Death|last=Crystal|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521012716|location=|pages=11|quote=A language is said to be dead when no one speaks it any more. It may continue to have existence in a recorded form, of course traditionally in writing, more recently as part of a sound or video archive (and it does in a sense 'live on' in this way) but unless it has fluent speakers one would not talk of it as a 'living language'.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although languages have always become extinct throughout human history, they are currently dying at an accelerated rate because of [[globalization]], [[neocolonialism]]&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Peter K|editor-last=Austin|editor2-first=Julia|editor2-last=Sallabank|chapter=Introduction|title=Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages|first=Peter K|last=Austin|first2=Julia|last2=Sallabank|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88215-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[language death|linguicide]] (language killing).&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 55-56 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil‘ad]], Shakuto-Neoh, Shiori &amp; Quer, Giovanni Matteo (2014), [http://www.professorzuckermann.com/#!native-tongue-title/cufd Native Tongue Title: Proposed Compensation for the Loss of Aboriginal Languages], ''Australian Aboriginal Studies'' 2014/1: 55-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language shift]] most commonly occurs when speakers switch to a language [[prestige language|associated with social or economic power]] or spoken more widely, the ultimate result being language death. The general consensus is that there are between 6,000&lt;ref name="Moseley"/&gt; and 7,000 languages currently spoken and that between 50% and 90% of them will have become extinct by the year 2100.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; The [[List of languages by number of native speakers|20 most common languages]], each with more than 50 million speakers, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, but most languages are spoken by fewer than 10,000 people.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The first step towards language death is ''potential endangerment''. This is when a language faces strong external pressure, but there are still communities of speakers who pass the language to their children. The second stage is ''endangerment''. Once a language has reached the endangerment stage, there are only a few speakers left and children are, for the most part, not learning the language. The third stage of language extinction is ''seriously endangered''. During this stage, a language is unlikely to survive another generation and will soon be extinct. The fourth stage is ''moribund'', followed by the fifth stage ''extinction''.

Many projects are under way aimed at preventing or slowing language loss by [[language revitalization|revitalizing]] endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages, often involving joint projects between language communities and linguists.&lt;ref&gt;Grinevald, Collette &amp; Michel Bert. 2011. "Speakers and Communities" in Austin, Peter K; Sallabank, Julia, eds. (2011). Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-88215-6}}. p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Across the world, many countries have enacted [[language policy|specific legislation]] aimed at protecting and stabilizing the language of indigenous [[speech community|speech communities]]. Recognizing that most of the world's endangered languages are unlikely to be revitalized, many linguists are also working on [[language documentation|documenting]] the thousands of languages of the world about which little or nothing is known.

==Number of languages==
The total number of contemporary languages in the world is not known, and it is not well defined what constitutes a separate language as opposed to a dialect. Estimates vary depending on the extent and means of the research undertaken, and the definition of a distinct language and the current state of knowledge of remote and isolated language communities. The number of known languages varies over time as some of them become extinct and others are newly discovered. An accurate amount of languages in the world was not yet known until the use of universal, [[systematic survey]]s in the later half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Death|last=Crystal|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521012716|location=England|pages=3|quote=As a result, without professional guidance, figures in popular estimation see-sawed wildly, from several hundred to tens of thousands. It took some time for systematic surveys to be established. Ethnologue, the largest present-day survey, first attempted a world-wide review only in 1974, an edition containing 5,687 languages.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of linguists in the early twentieth century refrained from making estimates. Before then, estimates were frequently the product of guesswork and very low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Death|last=Crystal|first=David|publisher=Cambridge|year=2000|isbn=0521653215|location=|pages=3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most active research agencies is [[SIL International]], which maintains a database, [[Ethnologue]], kept up to date by the contributions of linguists globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grenoble, Lenore A.  |author2=Lindsay J. Whaley |year=1998 |chapter=Preface |chapterurl=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805215/91027/frontmatter/9780521591027_frontmatter.pdf |format=[[PDF]]|pages=xi–xii|title=Endangered languages: Current Issues and Future Prospects.|editor=Lenore A. Grenoble|editor2=Lindsay J. Whaley |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-59102-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnologue's 2005 count of languages in its database, excluding duplicates in different countries, was 6,912, of which 32.8% (2,269) were in Asia, and 30.3% (2,092) in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistical Summaries|work=Ethnologue Web Version|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=area|publisher=SIL International|year=2009|accessdate=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contemporary tally must be regarded as a variable number within a range. Areas with a particularly large number of languages that are nearing extinction include: [[Eastern Siberia]],{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[Central Siberia]], [[Northern Australia]], [[Central America]], and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Northwest Pacific Plateau]]. Other hotspots are [[Oklahoma]] and the [[Southern Cone]] of South America.

===Endangered sign languages===
Almost all of the study of language endangerment has been with spoken languages. A UNESCO study of endangered languages does not mention sign languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/europe_index.html Endangered languages in Europe: indexes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some [[sign language]]s are also endangered, such as Alipur Village Sign Language (AVSL) of India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://elar.soas.ac.uk/deposit/avsl-59168 ELAR – The Endangered Languages Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adamorobe Sign Language]] of Ghana, [[Ban Khor Sign Language]] of Thailand, and [[Plains Indian Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pislresearch.com/ "Hand Talk: American Indian Sign Language"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hederpaly, Donna. ''[http://helenair.com/lifestyles/article_da41d7a8-a6a4-11df-9ff4-001cc4c03286.html Tribal "hand talk" considered an endangered language]'' Billings Gazette, August 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Many sign languages are used by small communities; small changes in their environment (such as contact with a larger sign language or dispersal of the deaf community) can lead to the endangerment and loss of their traditional sign language. Methods are being developed to assess the vitality of sign languages.&lt;ref&gt;Bickford, J. Albert, M. Paul Lewis, Gary F. Simons. 2014. Rating the vitality of sign languages. ''Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development'' 36(5):1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining and measuring endangerment==
While there is no definite threshold for identifying a language as endangered, [[UNESCO]]'s 2003 document entitled ''Language vitality and endangerment''&lt;ref name="UNESCO 6000" /&gt; outlines nine factors for determining language vitality:
# Intergenerational language transmission
# Absolute number of speakers
# Proportion of speakers existing within the total (global) population
# Language use within existing contexts and domains
# Response to language use in new domains and media
# Availability of materials for language education and literacy
# Government and institutional language policies
# Community attitudes toward their language
# Amount and quality of documentation
Many languages, for example some in [[Indonesia]], have tens of thousands of speakers but are endangered because children are no longer learning them, and speakers are shifting to using the [[national language]] (e.g. [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]) in place of local languages. In contrast, a language with only 500 speakers might be considered very much alive if it is the primary language of a community, and is the first (or only) spoken language of all children in that community.

Asserting that "Language diversity is essential to the human heritage", UNESCO's Ad Hoc Expert Group on Endangered Languages offers this definition of an endangered language: "... when its speakers cease to use it, use it in an increasingly reduced number of communicative domains, and cease to pass it on from one generation to the next. That is, there are no new speakers, adults or children."&lt;ref name="UNESCO 6000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/00120-EN.pdf|title=Language Vitality and Endangerment|date=|year=2003|website=|publisher=|format=pdf|access-date=12 August 2016|author=UNESCO Ad Hoc Expert Group on Endangered Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|UNESCO definitions}}&lt;!-- incoming links to here --&gt;UNESCO operates with four levels of language endangerment between "safe" (not endangered) and "extinct" (no living speakers), based on intergenerational transfer: "vulnerable" (not spoken by children outside the home), "definitely endangered" (children not speaking), "severely endangered" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and "critically endangered" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often [[Speaker types|semi-speaker]]s).&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{cite book

Using an alternative scheme of classification, linguist [[Michael E. Krauss]] defines languages as "safe" if it is considered that children will probably be speaking them in 100 years; "endangered" if children will probably not be speaking them in 100 years (approximately 60–80% of languages fall into this category) and "moribund" if children are not speaking them now.&lt;ref name=K2007&gt;{{Cite book|last =Krauss| first =Michael E.| author-link =Michael E.

Many scholars have devised techniques for determining whether languages are endangered. One of the earliest is GIDS (Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale) proposed by [[Joshua Fishman]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, Joshua. 1991. ''Reversing Language Shift''. Clevendon: Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 an entire issue of ''[[Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development]]'' was devoted to the study of ethnolinguistic vitality, Vol. 32.2, 2011, with several authors presenting their own tools for measuring language vitality. A number of other published works on measuring language vitality have been published, prepared by authors with varying situations and applications in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Arienne M. 2011.

==Causes==
According to the Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages,&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; there are four main types of causes of language endangerment:

Causes that put the populations that speak the languages in physical danger, such as:
# [[War]] and [[genocide]]. Examples of this are the language(s) of the indigenous population of [[Tasmania]] who were wiped out by colonists, and many extinct and endangered languages of the Americas where [[indigenous peoples]] have been subjected to genocidal violence. The [[Miskito language]] in [[Nicaragua]] and the [[Mayan languages]] of [[Guatemala]] have been affected by civil war. 
# [[Natural disaster]]s, [[famine]], [[disease]]. Any natural disaster severe enough to wipe out an entire population of native language speakers has the capability of endangering a language. An example of this is the languages spoken by the people of the Andaman Islands, who were seriously affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]].

Causes which prevent or discourage speakers from using a language, such as:
# [[Cultural imperialism|Cultural]], political, or economic [[marginalization]] creates a strong incentive for individuals to abandon their language (on behalf of themselves and their children) in favor of another more prestigious one. One example of this is assimilatory education. This frequently happens when indigenous populations, in order to achieve a higher social status, have better chance to get employment, or are forced to it in school, adopt the cultural and linguistic traits of a people who have come to dominate them through colonisation, conquest, or invasion; examples of this kind of endangerment are the [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], and [[Scots Language|Scots]] in [[Great Britain]], the [[Ainu language|Ainu]] language in [[Japan]], and the [[Chamorro language]] in [[Guam]]. This is the most common cause of language endangerment.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; Ever since the Indian government adopted Hindi as the official language of the union government, Hindi has taken over many languages in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2013/09/07/india-speaks-780-languages-220-lost-in-last-50-years-survey/|title=India speaks 780 languages, 220 lost in last 50 years – survey|last=Lalmalsawma|first=By David|website=Reuters Blogs|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of cultural imperialism include religion and technology. Religious groups may hold the belief that use of a certain language is immoral or require its followers to speak one language that is the approved language of the religion. Cultural hegemony may often arise not from domination or conquest but simply from increasing contact with a larger and more influential language community through better communications compared with the relative isolation of past centuries.
# [[Political repression]]. This has frequently happened when nation-states working to promote a single national culture limit the opportunities for using minority languages in the public sphere, schools, the media, and elsewhere, sometimes even prohibiting them altogether. Sometimes ethnic groups are forcibly resettled, or children may be removed to be schooled away from home, or otherwise have their chances of cultural and linguistic continuity disrupted. This has happened in the case of many [[Native American languages|Native American]] and [[Indigenous Australian languages|Australian languages]], as well as European and Asian minority languages such as [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], or [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]] in [[France]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] in [[Turkey]].
# [[Urbanization]]. The movement of people into urban areas can force people to learn the language of their new environment. Eventually, later generations will lose the ability to speak their native language, leading to endangerment. Once urbanization takes place, new families who live there will be under pressure to speak the [[lingua franca]] of the city. 
# [[Interethnic marriage|Intermarriage]] can also cause language endangerment, as there will always be pressure to speak one language to each other. This may lead to children only speaking the more common language spoken between the married couple.

Often multiple of these causes act at the same time. Poverty, disease and disasters often affect minority groups disproportionately, for example causing the dispersal of speaker populations and decreased survival rates for those who stay behind.

===Marginalization and endangerment===

Among the causes of language endangerment cultural, political and economic marginalization accounts for most of the world's language endangerment. Scholars distinguish between several types of marginalization: Economic dominance negatively affects minority languages when poverty leads people to migrate towards the cities or to other countries, thus dispersing the speakers. Cultural dominance occurs when literature and higher education is only accessible in the majority language. Political dominance occurs when education and political activity is carried out exclusively in a majority language.

Historically, in colonies, and elsewhere where speakers of different languages have come into contact, some languages have been considered superior to others: often one language has attained a dominant position in a country. Speakers of endangered languages may themselves come to associate their language with negative values such as poverty, illiteracy and social stigma, causing them to wish to adopt the dominant language which is associated with social and economical progress and [[modernity]].&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; Immigrants moving into an area may lead to the endangerment of the autochthonous language.&lt;ref&gt;Paris, Brian. The impact of immigrants on language vitality: A case study of Awar and Kayan. ''Language and Linguistics in Melanesia'' 32.2: 62-75. [http://www.langlxmelanesia.com/LLM%20Vol.%2032_2_Paris.pdf Web access].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Language endangerment affects both the languages themselves and the people that speak them.

===Effects on communities===
As communities lose their language they often also lose parts of their cultural traditions which are tied to that language, such as songs, myths and poetry that are not easily transferred to another language. This may in turn affect their sense of identity, producing a weakened social cohesion as their values and traditions are replaced with new ones. This is sometimes characterized as [[anomie]]. Losing a language may also have political consequences as some countries confer different political statuses or privileges on minority ethnic groups, often defining ethnicity in terms of language. That means that communities that lose their language may also lose political legitimacy as a community with special [[collective rights]]. Language can also be considered as scientific knowledge in topics such as medicine, philosophy, botany, and many more. It reflects a communities practices when dealing with the environment and each other. When a language is lost, this knowledge is lost as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerin|first=Valerie|year=2013|title=Language Endangerment|url=|journal=Language of the Pacific Islands|pages=185|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, language revitalization is correlated with better health outcomes in indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whalen|first1=D. H.|last2=Moss|first2=Margaret|last3=Baldwin|first3=Daryl|title=Healing through language: Positive physical health effects of indigenous language use|journal=F1000Research|date=9 May 2016|volume=5|doi=10.12688/f1000research.8656.1|url=https://f1000research.com/articles/5-852/v1|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on languages===
During language loss—sometimes referred to as ''obsolescence'' in the linguistic literature—the language that is being lost generally undergoes changes as speakers make their language more similar to the language that they are shifting to. For example, gradually losing grammatical or phonological complexities that are not found in the dominant language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy Dorian|Dorian, Nancy]] C. 1978. The Fate of Morphological Complexity in Language Death: Evidence from East Sutherland Gaelic. ''Language'' Vol. 54, No. 3: 590–609.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Annette. 1985. "The Fate of Ergativity in Dying Dyirbal". ''Language'' Vol. 61, No. 2: 378–396.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical considerations and attitudes===
Generally the accelerated pace of language endangerment is considered to be a problem by linguists and by the speakers. However, some linguists, such as the late phonetician [[Peter Ladefoged]], have argued that language death is a natural part of the process of human cultural development, and that languages die because communities stop speaking them for their own reasons. Ladefoged argued that linguists should simply document and describe languages scientifically, but not seek to interfere with the processes of language loss.&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, Peter 1992. Another view of endangered languages. Language 68(4): 809–11.&lt;!-- doi:10.2307/416854, JSTOR 416854 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A similar view has been argued at length by linguist [[Salikoko Mufwene]], who sees the cycles of language death and emergence of new languages through [[Creole language|creolization]] as a continuous ongoing process.&lt;ref&gt;Mufwene, Salikoko (2004). "Language birth and death". Annual Review of Anthropology 33: 201–222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mufwene, Salikoko (2001). The ecology of language evolution. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-511-01934-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Mufwene, Salikoko (2008). Language Evolution: Contact, Competition and Change. Continuum International Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of linguists do consider that language loss is an ethical problem, as they consider that most communities would prefer to maintain their languages if given a real choice. They also consider it a scientific problem, because language loss on the scale currently taking place will mean that future linguists will only have access to a fraction of the world's linguistic diversity, therefore their picture of what human language is—and can be—will be limited.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, Krauss, Watahomigie, Yamamoto, Craig, &amp; Jeanne 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Austin &amp; Sallabank 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nettle &amp; Romaine 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skuttnabb-Kangas 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Austin 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Some linguists consider linguistic diversity to be analogous to biological diversity, and compare language endangerment to [[Endangered species|wildlife endangerment]].&lt;ref&gt;Mafﬁ L, ed. 2001. On Biocultural Diversity: Linking Language, Knowledge, and the Environment. Washington, DC: Smithsonian Inst. Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
Linguists, members of endangered language communities, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and international organizations such as UNESCO and the European Union are actively working to save and stabilize endangered languages.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;  Once a language is determined to be endangered, there are three steps that can be taken in order to stabilize or rescue the language. The first is language documentation, the second is language revitalization and the third is language maintenance.&lt;ref name="Handbook" /&gt;

[[Language documentation]] is the documentation in writing and audio-visual recording of [[grammar]], vocabulary, and oral traditions (e.g. stories, songs, religious texts) of endangered languages. It entails producing descriptive grammars, collections of texts and dictionaries of the languages, and it requires the establishment of a secure archive where the material can be stored once it is produced so that it can be accessed by future generations of speakers or scientists.&lt;ref name="Handbook" /&gt;

[[Language revitalization]] is the process by which a language community through political, community, and educational means attempts to increase the number of active speakers of the endangered language.&lt;ref name="Handbook" /&gt; This process is also sometimes referred to as [[language revitalization|language revival or reversing language shift]].&lt;ref name="Handbook" /&gt; Vocabulary and courses are available online for a number of endangered languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Courses|url=http://lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=11 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language maintenance refers to the support given to languages that need for their survival to be protected from outsiders who can ultimately affect the number of speakers of a language.&lt;ref name="Handbook" /&gt; UNESCO's strides towards preventing language extinction involves promoting and supporting the language in aspects such as education, culture, communication and information, and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ on endangered languages {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/faq-on-endangered-languages/|website=www.unesco.org|accessdate=25 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another option is "post-vernacular maintenance": the teaching of some words and concepts of the lost language, rather than revival proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5158">In any of several studies that treat the use of [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s—for example, in [[linguistics]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[semiotics]]—the '''extension''' of a concept, idea, or [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] consists of the things to which it applies, in contrast with its [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] or [[intension]], which consists very roughly of the ideas, properties, or corresponding signs that are implied or suggested by the concept in question.

In philosophical [[semantics]] or the [[philosophy of language]], the 'extension' of a concept or expression is the set of things it extends to, or applies to, if it is the sort of concept or expression that a single object by itself can satisfy.  Concepts and expressions of this sort are [[monad (Greek philosophy)|monadic]] or "one-place" concepts and expressions.

So the extension of the word "dog" is the set of all (past, present and future) dogs in the world: the set includes Fido, Rover, [[Lassie]], Rex, and so on.  The extension of the phrase "Wikipedia reader" includes each person who has ever read Wikipedia, including ''you''.

The extension of a whole statement, as opposed to a word or phrase, is defined (since [[Frege]] 1892) as its [[truth value]]. So the extension of "Lassie is famous" is the logical value 'true', since Lassie is famous.

Some concepts and expressions are such that they don't apply to objects individually, but rather serve to relate objects to objects.  For example, the words "before" and "after" do not apply to objects individually—it makes no sense to say "Jim is before" or "Jim is after"—but to one thing in relation to another, as in "The wedding is before the reception" and "The reception is after the wedding".  Such "relational" or "polyadic" ("many-place") concepts and expressions have, for their extension, the set of all sequences of objects that satisfy the concept or expression in question.  So the extension of "before" is the set of all (ordered) pairs of objects such that the first one is before the second one.

== Mathematics ==
In [[mathematics]], the 'extension' of a mathematical concept is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] that is specified by that concept.{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

For example, the extension of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is a set of [[ordered pair]]s that pair up the arguments and values of the function; in other words, the function's graph.  The extension of an object in [[abstract algebra]], such as a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], is the [[underlying set]] of the object. The extension of a set is the set itself. That a set can capture the notion of the extension of anything is the idea behind the [[axiom of extensionality]] in [[axiomatic set theory]].

This kind of extension is used so constantly in contemporary mathematics based on [[set theory]] that it can be called an implicit assumption.

== Computer science ==

In [[computer science]], some [[database]] textbooks use the term 'intension' to refer to the [[logical schema|schema]] of a database, and 'extension' to refer to particular [[Row (database)|instance]]s of a database.

== Metaphysical implications ==

There is an ongoing controversy in [[metaphysics]] about whether or not there are, in addition to actual, existing things, non-actual or nonexistent things.  If there are—if, for instance, there are possible but non-actual dogs (dogs of some non-actual but possible species, perhaps) or nonexistent beings (like Sherlock Holmes, perhaps)—then these things might also figure in the extensions of various concepts and expressions.  If not, only existing, actual things can be in the extension of a concept or expression.  Note that "actual" may not mean the same as "existing".  Perhaps there exist things that are merely possible, but not actual.  (Maybe they exist in other universes, and these universes are other "[[possible worlds]]"—possible alternatives to the actual world.)  Perhaps some actual things are nonexistent.  (Sherlock Holmes seems to be an ''actual'' example of a fictional character; one might think there are many other characters [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] ''might'' have invented, though he actually invented Holmes.)

A similar problem arises for objects that no longer exist.  The extension of the term "Socrates", for example, seems to be a (currently) non-existent object.  [[Free logic]] is one attempt to avoid some of these problems.

== General semantics ==

Some fundamental formulations in the field of [[general semantics]] rely heavily on a valuation of extension over [[intension]]. See for example extension, and the [[#External links|extensional devices]].

{{Refimprove|date=April 2015}}

'''French grammar''' is the set of rules by which the [[French language]] creates statements, questions and commands. In many respects, it is quite similar to that of the other [[Romance languages]].

French is a moderately [[Inflection|inflected]] language. [[Noun]]s and most [[pronoun]]s are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); [[adjective]]s, for number and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; [[personal pronoun]]s and a few other pronouns, for [[grammatical person|person]], number, gender, and [[grammatical case|case]]; and [[verb]]s, for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and the person and number of their [[subject (grammar)|subjects]]. Case is primarily marked using [[word order]] and [[preposition]]s, while certain verb features are marked using [[auxiliary verb]]s.

==Verbs==
{{main article|French verbs}}

Verbs in French are conjugated to reflect the following information:
* a [[grammatical mood|mood]] ([[Indicative mood|indicative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[Conditional mood|conditional]],&lt;ref name="conditional"&gt;In some of its uses, the conditional acts as a tense of the indicative mood; in other uses, including the use from which it takes its name, it acts as a distinct mood.&lt;/ref&gt; [[infinitive]], [[participle]], or [[gerundive]]&lt;ref name="analytic information"&gt;The gerundive mood, the perfect, and the passive and reflexive voices are not [[synthetic language|synthetic]] but [[analytic language|analytic]]; that is, they are expressed using multi-word verb forms.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* a [[grammatical tense|tense]] ([[Past tense|past]], [[Present tense|present]], or [[Future tense|future]], though not all tenses can be combined with all moods)
* an [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] ([[Perfective aspect|perfective]] or [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]])
* a [[grammatical voice|voice]] ([[Active voice|active]], [[Passive voice|passive]],&lt;ref name="analytic information"/&gt; or [[reflexive voice|reflexive]]&lt;ref name="analytic information"/&gt;)

Some of these features are combined into seven [[tense–aspect–mood]] combinations.  The simple (one-word) forms are commonly referred to as the present, the simple past or [[preterite]]&lt;ref name="pret and imp"&gt;The preterite and imperfect are sometimes called, somewhat redundantly, the ''preterite past'' and ''imperfect past''. The preterite is also called the ''simple past'', a translation of its French name (''le passé simple'').&lt;/ref&gt; (past tense, perfective aspect), the [[imperfect]]&lt;ref name="pret and imp"/&gt; (past tense, imperfective aspect), the future, the conditional,&lt;ref name="conditional"/&gt; the present subjunctive, and the imperfect subjunctive. However, the simple past is rarely used in informal French, and the imperfect subjunctive is rarely used in modern French at all.

Verbs in the finite moods (indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and conditional) are also conjugated to [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with their subjects in [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, or third) and [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural). As in English, the subject must be included (except in the imperative mood); in other words, unlike other [[Romance language]]s, French is neither a [[null-subject language]] nor a [[pro-drop language]].

[[Auxiliary verb]]s are combined with past participles of main verbs to produce compound tenses, including the compound past ''([[passé composé]])''. For most main verbs the auxiliary is (the appropriate form of) ''avoir'' ("to have"), but for reflexive verbs and certain intransitive verbs the auxiliary is a form of ''être'' ("to be"). The participle agrees with the subject when the auxiliary is ''être'', and with a preceding [[direct object]] (if any) when the auxiliary is ''avoir''. Forms of ''être'' are also used with the past participles of transitive verbs to form the passive voice.

The imperative mood, which only has first-person plural and second-person singular and plural forms, usually has forms similar or identical to the corresponding ones in the present indicative.

==Nouns==

=== Gender ===
Every French [[noun]] has a [[grammatical gender]], either masculine or feminine. The grammatical gender of a noun referring to a human usually corresponds to the noun's natural gender (i.e., its referent's [[sex]] or [[gender]]). For such nouns, there will very often be one noun of each gender, with the choice of noun being determined by the natural gender of the person described; for example, a male singer is a ''chanteur'', while a female singer is a ''chanteuse''. A plural noun that refers to both males and females is masculine. In some cases, the two nouns are identical in form, with the difference only being marked in neighbouring words (due to gender agreement; see [[#Articles and determiners|below]]); a Catholic man is ''un catholique'', while a Catholic woman is ''une catholique''. Nonetheless, there are some such nouns that retain their grammatical gender regardless of natural gender; ''personne'' 'person' is always feminine, while (at least in "standard" French) ''professeur'' 'teacher' is always masculine. In Canadian French, ''une professeure'' is the standard feminine form, which is becoming more and more common in European French.

A noun's gender is not perfectly predictable from its form, but there are some trends. As a very broad trend, nouns ending in ''-e'' tend to be feminine, while the rest tend to be masculine. More consistently, some endings, such as ''-sion'', ''-tion'', ''-aison'' and ''-ité'' occur almost exclusively with feminine nouns, while others, such as ''-aire'' and ''-isme''  occur almost exclusively with masculine ones. Nonetheless, a noun that seems masculine judging by its ending might actually be feminine (e.g., ''la peau'' 'skin') or vice versa (e.g., ''un squelette'' 'skeleton').

[[Noun clause]]s are masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguee.fr/francais-anglais/search?source=anglais&amp;query=it+is+disappointing|title=it is disappointing - Traduction française – Linguee|author=|date=|work=Linguee.fr|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very small number of nouns can be used either in masculine or feminine gender with the same meaning (e.g., ''après-midi'' 'afternoon'). Often one gender is preferred over the other. Some (very rare) nouns change gender according to the way they are used: the words ''amour'' 'love' and ''délice'' 'pleasure' are masculine in singular and feminine in plural; the word ''orgue'' 'organ' is masculine, but when used emphatically in plural to refer to a church organ it becomes feminine (''les grandes orgues''); the plural noun ''gens'' 'people' changes gender in a very unusual way, being usually masculine but triggering feminine agreement when certain adjectives precede the word.

The vocabulary of French includes many [[homophone]]s, i.e., pairs of words with different spellings but the same pronunciation. Grammatical gender, however, may serve to distinguish some of these. For example, ''le pot'' 'pot' and ''la peau'' 'skin' are both pronounced {{IPA|[po]}} but disagree in gender.

=== Number ===
As in English, nouns inflect for [[grammatical number|number]]. In terms of spelling, the plural is usually formed from the singular by adding the letter ''-s'' (cf. ''maison &gt; maisons'' 'houses'). Nouns ending in ''-au, -eu,'' and ''-ou'' often take the ending ''-x'' instead (cf. ''jeu &gt; jeux'' 'games'). However, the endings ''-s'' and ''-x'' are mute outside of liaison contexts, so the plural form of a noun generally has the same pronunciation as the singular. Nouns which end in ''-s, -x'' or ''-z'' in the singular are left unchanged in the plural in both pronunciation and spelling (cf. ''croix &gt; croix'' 'crosses', both pronounced [kʁwa]).

In spoken French, therefore, the plurality of a noun generally cannot be determined from the pronunciation of the noun, but it is commonly marked by the form of a preceding article or determiner (cf. ''la maison'' [la mɛzɔ̃] 'the house' &gt; '' '''les''' maisons'' [le mɛzɔ̃] 'the houses'; ''mon frère'' [mɔ̃ fʁɛːʁ] 'my brother' &gt; '' '''mes''' frères'' [me fʁɛːʁ] 'my brothers').

[[Liaison (French)|Liaison]] between a plural noun and a following adjective is only common in careful speech, for example, by newsreaders. In this case the plural ending ''-s'' or ''-x'' may be pronounced: ''des fenêtre'''s''' ouvertes'' {{IPA|[dɛ fənɛtʁə'''z'''‿uvɛʁt]}} ("open windows"). In common speech this is almost never done, so singular and plural forms of most nouns are homophonous in all contexts.

However, some French nouns have distinguishable spoken plural forms. This includes most of those ending in ''-al'', whose plural form is ''-aux'' (cf. ''cheval'' {{IPA|[ʃəval]}} &gt; ''chevaux'' {{IPA|[ʃəvo]}} 'horses'), as well as a few nouns ending in ''-ail'' which also follow this pattern (cf. ''travail'' [tʁavaj] &gt; ''travaux'' [tʁavo] 'works'). Three nouns form completely irregular plurals: ''aïeul'' [ajœl] &gt; ''aïeux'' [ajø] 'ancestors'; ''ciel'' [sjɛl] &gt; ''cieux'' [sjø] 'heavens'; and ''œil'' [œj] &gt; ''yeux'' [jø] 'eyes'. Three other nouns have regular plurals in spelling but have irregular pronunciations: ''bœuf'' {{IPA|[bœf]}} &gt; ''bœufs'' {{IPA|[bø]}} 'oxen, cattle'; ''œuf'' {{IPA|[œf]}} &gt; ''œufs'' {{IPA|[ø]}} 'eggs'; and ''os'' {{IPA|[ɔs]}} &gt; ''os'' {{IPA|[o]}} 'bones'.

As with English, most uncountable nouns are grammatically treated as singular, though some are plural, such as ''les mathématiques'' 'mathematics'; some nouns that are uncountable in English are countable in French, such as ''une information'' 'a piece of information'.

=== Case ===
Nouns in French are not inflected for any other grammatical categories. (However, personal pronouns are inflected for [[grammatical case|case]] and [[grammatical person|person]]; see [[#Pronouns|below]].)

==Articles and determiners==
{{main article|French articles and determiners}}

[[Article (grammar)|Articles]] and [[determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] agree in gender and number with the noun they determine; unlike with nouns, this inflection is made in speech as well as in writing.

French has three articles: definite, indefinite, and partitive. The difference between the definite and indefinite articles is similar to that in English (definite: ''the''; indefinite: ''a'', ''an''), except that the indefinite article has a plural form (similar to ''some'', though English normally doesn't use an article before indefinite plural nouns). The partitive article is similar to the indefinite article but used for uncountable singular nouns.

==Adjectives==
An adjective must agree in gender and number with the noun it modifies. French adjectives therefore have four forms: masculine singular, feminine singular, masculine plural, and feminine plural.

The masculine singular, an adjective's basic form, is listed in dictionaries. The feminine singular is normally formed by adding ''-e'' to the basic form. This ''-e'' is mute, which makes many masculine and feminine forms [[homophone|homophonous]] (cf. ''civil &gt; civile'' 'civil', both pronounced /sivil/). However, the ending causes "mute" final sounds to be pronounced, whereby masculine-feminine pairs become distinguishable in pronunciation if the masculine form ends in a mute consonant, which is the case with a great deal of adjectives (cf. ''lourd'' {{IPA|[luʁ]}} ''&gt; lourde'' {{IPA|[luʁd]}} 'heavy'). Under certain circumstances, other minor changes occur in the formation of feminine forms, such as the placement of an accent, the doubling of a consonant, or its replacement with another, changes that often reflect the pronunciation of such endings (cf. ''bon'' [bɔ̃] &gt; ''bonne'' [bɔn] 'good'; ''heureux'' [øʁø] &gt; ''heureuse'' [øʁøːz] 'happy'). Irregular feminine forms include ''beau &gt; belle'' 'beautiful', ''blanc &gt; blanche'' 'white', and a limited number of others. If an adjective's basic form ends in ''-e'', it is left unchanged in the feminine (cf. ''riche &gt; riche'' 'rich').

The plural is normally formed by adding ''-s'' to the singular (masculine and feminine). This ''-s'' is usually mute, but pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} in [[liaison (French)|liaison]] with a following noun that begins with a vowel. Unlike liaison after plural nouns, liaison after plural adjectives is common and even obligatory in standard usage. If the basic form ends in ''-s, -x'', or ''-z'', an adjective is left unchanged in the masculine plural (cf. ''doux &gt; doux'' 'soft, gentle'). A few adjectives take the (also mute) ending ''-x'' in the masculine plural (cf. ''nouveau &gt; nouveaux'' 'new'). Plural forms that are distinguishable from the singular outside of liaison environments occur only with adjectives ending in ''-al''. These normally have ''-aux'' in the masculine plural (cf. ''central'' {{IPA|[sɑ᷉tʁal]}} ''&gt; centraux'' {{IPA|[sɑ᷉tʁo]}} 'central'). By contrast, the feminine plural is formed according to the general rule: ''centrale &gt; centrales''.

Due to the aforementioned rules, French adjectives might have four distinguished written forms which are all pronounced the same. This is the case if an adjective's masculine and feminine forms are homophonous and if there is no liaison between the adjective and a following noun.

|{{IPA|de pʁɛ᷉sɛs '''tyʁk'''}}
|''Turkish princesses''
|}

On the other hand, if the masculine and feminine forms have different pronunciations and liaison does occur, all four forms can be distinguishable in pronunciation. Adjective declension is therefore important in spoken French, though to a lesser extent than in writing. (All forms distinguished in pronunciation are also distinguished in writing, but not vice versa.)

|''great empresses''
|}

Due to the peculiar [[French orthography|orthography of French]], which denotes mute final consonants, most feminine forms seem regular in terms of their spelling because they are formed by adding ''-e'' to the masculine form, e.g., ''grand &gt; grand'''e''', lent &gt; lent'''e''', persan &gt; persan'''e'''''. However, if we put this etymologic orthography aside and consider only current pronunciation, the formation of French female forms becomes quite irregular with several possible "endings": {{IPA|[ɡʁɑ̃]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɡʁɑ̃'''d''']}}, {{IPA|[lɑ̃]}} &gt; {{IPA|[lɑ̃'''t''']}}, {{IPA|[pɛʁsɑ̃]}} &gt; {{IPA|[pɛʁs'''an''']}}.

Most adjectives, when used attributively, appear after their nouns: ''le vin '''rouge''''' ("the ''red'' wine"). A number of adjectives (often having to do with beauty, age, goodness, or size, a tendency summarized by the acronym "BAGS"), come before their nouns: ''une '''belle''' femme'' ("a ''beautiful'' woman"). With a few adjectives of the latter type, there are two masculine singular forms: one used before consonants (the basic form), and one used before vowels. For example, the adjective ''beau'' ("beautiful") changes form from ''un '''beau''' garçon'' ("a ''handsome'' boy") to ''un '''bel''' homme'' ("a ''handsome'' man"). Some adjectives change position depending on their meaning, sometimes preceding their nouns and sometimes following them. For example, ''ancien'' means "former" when it precedes its noun, but "ancient" when it follows it. To give another example, ''un homme '''grand''''' means "a ''tall'' man", whereas ''un '''grand''' homme'' means "a ''great'' man".

Many compound words contain an adjective, such as '''''belle'''-mère'' "mother-in-law", which is distinct from '''''belle''' mère'' "beautiful mother". Some of them use an [[archaism|archaic]] form of the feminine adjective that lacks the final ''-e'' and sometimes show an apostrophe instead of a hyphen, such as '''''grand' '''route'' "main country road", which is distinct from '''''grande''' route'' "long way", and '''''grand'''-mère'' "grandmother", which is distinct from '''''grande''' mère'' "tall mother".

==Adverbs==
{{main article|French adverbs}}

As in English, [[adverb]]s in French are used to modify adjectives, other adverbs, verbs, or clauses. Most adverbs are derived from an adjective by adding the suffix ''-ment'' to its feminine form (''-ment'' is analogous to the English suffix ''-ly''), though some adverbs are derived irregularly and others do not derive from adjectives at all.

Adverbs themselves are generally invariable. Exceptions to this are a handful of adverbs exhibiting [[Syncretism (linguistics)|syncretic]] comparative forms (e.g. ''bien'' "well" → ''mieux'' "better") and the adverb ''tout'' "wholly, very" which agrees in gender and number with the adjective it modifies (e.g. ''tout petit'' "very small, m." → ''toute petite'' "very small, f.").

==Prepositions==
French prepositions link two related parts of a sentence. In word order, they are placed in front of a noun in order to specify the relationship between the noun and the verb, adjective, or other noun that precedes it. Some common French prepositions are: ''à'' (to, at, in), ''à côté de'' (next to, beside), ''après'' (after), ''au sujet de'' (about, on the subject of), ''avant'' (before), ''avec'' (with), ''chez'' (at the home/office of, among), ''contre'' (against), ''dans'' (in), ''d'après'' (according to), ''de'' (from, of, about), ''depuis'' (since, for), ''derrière'' (in back of, behind), ''devant'' (in front of), ''durant'' (during, while), ''en'' (in, on, to), ''en dehors de'' (outside of), ''en face de'' (facing, across from), ''entre'' (between), ''envers'' (toward), ''environ'' (approximately), ''hors de'' (outside of), ''jusque'' (until, up to, even), ''loin de'' (far from), ''malgré'' (despite), ''par'' (by, through), ''parmi'' (among), ''pendant'' (during), ''pour'' (for), ''près de'' (near), ''quant à'' (as for, regarding), ''sans'' (without), ''selon'' (according to), ''sous'' (under), ''suivant'' (according to), ''sur'' (on), ''vers'' (toward).

==Pronouns==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pronoun]] --&gt;
{{main article|French pronouns}}

In French [[pronouns]] can be inflected to indicate their role in a clause (subject, direct object, etc.), as well as the person, gender, and number of their referent. Not all of these inflections may be present at once; for example, the [[relative pronoun]] ''que'' (''that'', ''which'', ''whom'') may have any referent, while the [[possessive pronoun]] ''le mien'' (''mine'') may have any role in a clause.

As noted above, French (like English) is a non-pro-drop ("pronoun-dropping") language; therefore, pronouns feature prominently in the language. Impersonal verbs (e.g., ''pleuvoir'' – ''to rain'') use the impersonal pronoun ''il'' (analogous to English ''it'').

French object pronouns are all [[clitic]]s. Some appear so consistently – especially in everyday speech — that some{{Who|date=February 2012}} have commented that French could almost be considered to demonstrate [[polypersonal agreement]].

==Negation==
French usually expresses negation in two parts, with the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''ne'' attached to the verb, and one or more negative words ([[connegative]]s) that modify the verb or one of its [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]]. Negation encircles a conjugated verb with ''ne'' after the subject and the connegative after verb, if the verb is [[finite verb|finite]] or a [[gerund]]. However, both parts of the negation come before the targeted verb when it is in its [[infinitive]] form. For example:
* ''Je les ai pris'' 'I took them' → ''Je '''ne''' les ai '''pas''' pris'' 'I did not take them'
* ''Je voudrais regarder un film et m'endormir'' 'I would like to watch a movie and fall asleep' &lt;br&gt;→ ''Je voudrais regarder un film et '''ne''' '''pas''' m'endormir.'' 'I would like to watch a movie and '''not''' fall asleep'

Other negative words used in combination with ''ne'' are:
* negative adverbs
:''ne … plus'' — "not anymore, no longer"
:''ne … jamais'' — "never"
:''ne … nulle part'' — "nowhere"
:''ne … guère'' — "not much, hardly" (literary)
:''ne … point / aucunement / nullement'' — "not, not at all" (literary)
* negative pronouns
:''ne … rien'' — "nothing"
:''ne … personne'' — "nobody"
* others
:(determiner) ''ne … aucun'' — "no/not any" (also ''nul'', literary)
:(restrictive particle) ''ne … que'' — "only"

Examples:
* « Je '''ne''' sais '''pas'''. » — "I do not know."
* « Il '''ne''' fume '''plus'''. » — "He does not smoke anymore."
* « Nous '''n''''avons vu '''personne'''. » — "We did not see anybody."
* « Elle '''n''''a '''rien''' bu. » — "She didn't drink anything."
* « Je '''n''''ai '''aucune''' idée. » — "I have no idea."
* « Vous '''ne''' mangez '''que''' des légumes ? » — "You only eat vegetables?"

The negative adverbs (and ''rien'') follow finite verbs but precede infinitives (along with ''ne''):
* « Il prétend ne pas/ne jamais/ne rien fumer. » — "He claims not to smoke/to never smoke/to smoke nothing."

Moreover, it is possible for ''rien'' and ''personne'' to be used as the subject of a sentence, which moves them to the beginning of the sentence (before the ''ne''):
* « Rien n'est certain. » — "Nothing is certain."
* « Personne n'est arrivé. » — "Nobody came."

Several negative words (other than ''pas'') can appear in the same sentence, but the sentence is still usually interpreted as a simple negation. When another negative word occurs with ''pas'', a double negation interpretation usually arises, but this construction is criticised.
* « Elle n'a '''plus''' '''jamais''' '''rien''' dit à '''personne'''. » — "She never said anything else to anybody."
* « Elle n'a '''pas''' vu '''personne'''.  — "She did not see nobody (i.e., she saw somebody)."

=== Colloquial usage ===
In colloquial French, it is common to drop the ''ne'', although this can create some ambiguity with the ''ne … plus'' construction when written down, as ''plus'' could mean either "more" or "not anymore". Generally when ''plus'' is used to mean "more", the final "s" is pronounced ([plys]) whereas it is never pronounced when used to mean "not anymore" ([ply]).

As an example, the informal sentence ''Il y en a plus'' could be pronounced with the final [s] ([il i ɑ̃n a plys, jɑ̃n a plys]) to mean "There is more". Or it could be pronounced without it ([il i ɑ̃n a ply, jɑ̃n a ply]) to mean "There is none left".

=== Independent ''ne'' ===
In certain, mostly literary constructions, ''ne'' can express negation by itself (without ''pas'' or another negative word). The four verbs that can use this construction are ''pouvoir'' ("to be able to"), ''savoir'' ("to know"), ''oser'' ("to dare"), and ''cesser'' ("to cease").
* (standard, ''ne'' + ''pas'') « Je '''n''''ai '''pas''' pu venir. » — "I was not able to come."
* (casual, ''pas'' only) « J'ai '''pas''' pu venir. » [same]
* (literary, ''ne'' only) « Je '''n''''ai pu venir. » [same];&lt;br&gt;''cf.'' phrase « Je '''ne''' sais quoi » — "I do not know what [it is]" remaining in colloquial speech as a [[Fossilization (linguistics)|fossilized]] phrase

=== Expletive ''ne'' ===
In certain cases in formal French, the word ''ne'' can be used without signifying negation; the ''ne'' in such instances is known as expletive ''ne'' (French: ''ne explétif):

:« J'ai peur que cela '''ne''' se reproduise. » — "I am afraid that it might happen again."
:« Il est arrivé avant que nous '''n''''ayons commencé. » — "He arrived before we started."
:« Ils sont plus nombreux que tu '''ne''' le crois. » — "There are more of them than you think."

Expletive ''ne'' is found in finite subordinate clauses (never before an infinitive). It is characteristic of literary rather than colloquial style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/ne-expletif/ | title = Ne explétif - French Negation | publisher = Lawless French | first = Laura K | last = Lawless | accessdate = 2007-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other registers French tends to not use any negation at all in such clauses, e.g., ''J'ai peur que cela se reproduise''.

The following contexts allow expletive ''ne''
* the complement clause of verbs expressing fear or avoidance: ''craindre'' (to fear), ''avoir peur'' (to be afraid), ''empêcher'' (to prevent), ''éviter'' (to avoid)
* the complement clause of verbs expressing doubt or denial: ''douter'' (to doubt), ''nier'' (to deny)
* [[adverbial clause]]s introduced by the following expressions: ''avant que'' (before), ''à moins que'' (unless), ''de peur/crainte que'' (for fear that)
* comparative constructions expressing inequality: ''autre'' (other), ''meilleur'' (better), ''plus fort'' (stronger), ''moins intelligent'' (less intelligent), etc.

==Existential clauses==
In French, the equivalent of the English [[existential clause]] "there is" is expressed with ''il y a'', literally, "it there has" or "it has to it".  The verb may be conjugated to indicate tense, but always remains in the third person singular. For example
* « Il y a deux bergers et quinze moutons dans le pré. » - "There are two shepherds and fifteen sheep in the meadow."
* « Il y aura beaucoup à manger. » - "There will be a lot to eat."
* « Il y aurait deux morts et cinq blessés dans l'accident. » - "There appears to have been (lit. would have) two dead and five injured in the accident." (as in news reporting)
* « Il n'y avait personne chez les Martin. » - "There was nobody at the Martins' home."

This construction is also used to express the passage of time since an event occurred, like the English ''ago'' or ''it has been'':
* « Je l'ai vu il y a deux jours. » - "I saw him two days ago."
* « Il y avait longtemps que je ne l'avais pas vu. » - "It had been a long time since I had seen him."
* « Le langage d’il y a cent ans est très différent de celui d’aujourd’hui. » - "The language/usage of one hundred years ago is very different from that of today."

In informal speech, ''il y'' is typically reduced to [j], as in:
* Y a [ja] deux bergers et quinze moutons dans le pré.
* Y aura [joʁa] beaucoup à manger.
* Y avait [javɛ] personne chez les Martin.
* Je l'ai vu y a deux jours.

== Word order ==
The components of a declarative clause are typically arranged in the following order (though not all components are always present):
# Adverb(s)
# Subject
# ''ne'' (usually a marker for negation, though it has some other uses)
# First- and second-person object pronoun (''me'', ''te'', ''nous'', ''vous'') or the third-person reflexive pronoun (''se'')
# Third-person human direct-object pronoun (''le'', ''la'', ''les'')
# Third-person human indirect-object pronoun (''lui'' or ''leur'')
# The pronoun ''y''
# The pronoun ''en''
# Finite verb (may be an auxiliary)
# Adverb(s)
# The pronoun ''rien'' (if not subject)
# Main verb (if the finite verb is an auxiliary)
# Adverb(s) and object(s)

French basic word order is thus [[subject–verb–object]] (''Je lisais un livre'': I was reading a book) although, if the object is a [[clitic]] pronoun, it precedes the verb (''Je le lisais'': I was reading it). Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] of the subject and verb. For example, some adverbial expressions placed at the beginning of a sentence trigger inversion of pronominal subjects: ''Peut-être est-elle partie'' (Maybe she has left).

Word order can be an indicator of stylistic [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]. For instance, inversion of nominal subjects is possible in many relative clauses.
* C'est le livre [que mon cousin lui a donné]. (Object–subject–verb)
* C'est le livre [que lui a donné mon cousin]. (Object–verb–subject)
:"That's the book my cousin gave her."
The second version of the sentence, with inversion, is more formal.

'''Ginger Software''' is an Israeli start-up company that has developed language enhancement technology that uses statistical algorithms in conjunction with [[natural language processing]], aiming to improve written communications, develop English speaking skills and boost smartphone productivity. The company was founded towards the end of 2007 by Yael Karov and Avner Zangvil. Ginger Software differentiates itself by recognizing words in the context of complete sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israel21c.org/technology/ginger-s-spellchecker-helps-dyslexics-get-it-right |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217022034/http://www.israel21c.org/technology/ginger-s-spellchecker-helps-dyslexics-get-it-right |archivedate=2012-02-17 |df= }} Ginger's Spell Checker Helps Dyslexics Get It Right&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, Ginger Software was one of nine projects approved by the Board of Governors of the [[Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation]] for a funding of $8.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bird-israel-us-binational-industrial-rd-foundation-to-invest-81-million-in-nine-new-projects-2011-12-20] BIRD - Israel-US Binational Industrial R&amp;D Foundation to Invest $8.1 Million in Nine new Projects&lt;/ref&gt; The company also raised $3 million from private Israeli and US investors in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2009/01/25/3938015.htm] Text correction co Ginger raises $3m&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 2014 [[Intel]] acquired one of Ginger's business units and the rights to use the company's patented technology. &lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/09/intel-ginger-software-personal-assistant/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founders==
Before founding Ginger Software, Yael Karov had worked with [[Rosetta Genomics]] as its Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of Research and Development from 2003 to 2006, and with [[ClickSoftware Technologies]] as a Director of Research and Development from 1990 to 1994. Karov also founded Agentics, a company specializing in free-text classification of e-commerce product information based on natural language processing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gingersoftware.com/about/#ixzz1mLpPdvt8] http://www.gingersoftware.com/about/#ixzz1mLpPdvt8&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996. 

Avner Zangvil is the co-founder of Ginger Software and the husband of Yael Karov. Zangvil co-founded Menta Software in 1996 with his brother Arnon Zangvil to develop a product that transforms any Windows-based application into a Web-enabled application usable from any remote computer running a Web browser. Menta was acquired by GraphOn Corporation in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gingersoftware.com/about/#ixzz1mLsbZs20] http://www.gingersoftware.com/about/#ixzz1mLsbZs20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Ginger Software uses patented software algorithms that deal with [[natural language processing]]. The company claims that the algorithm allows it to correct the written sentences with relatively high accuracy (eliminating up to 95 percent of writing errors),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gingersoftware.com/company-overview/ Ginger Website]&lt;/ref&gt; compared to standard spell checkers. Its unique algorithm allows the software to understand the context of the sentence rather than correcting based solely on a word. According to its founder, Karov, the software operates on the logic of sentence context in addition to the memory of a database of words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/israeli-start-up-company-may-have-a-cure-for-dyslexic-typos-1.249855 Israeli start-up company may have a cure for dyslexic typos Israel News | Haaretz]&lt;/ref&gt; The company is at the heart of a growing revolution in the world of [[assistive technology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn.gingersoftware.com/media/pdf/TheDyslexiaRevolution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ginger claims that the benefits of the software have been leveraged by native English and non-native speakers alike, and have also found value in niche markets like dyslexia management. They further claim that [[ESL]] users derive great benefit from the use of the software, as it lets them write error-free English text. Its use also extends to native English speaking business professionals and students who use it as a 'safety net' for their email edits, as well as international students writing in English.{{cn|date=March 2014}}

More recently, the company has focused on implementing its technology in mobile devices as an integral component of its mobile keyboard products.

==Products==
Ginger Software products include [http://www.gingersoftware.com/ginger-for-windows Ginger Page], a cross-platform writing enhancement app, and Ginger Keyboard which is available for [http://www.gingersoftware.com/android-keyboard-page Android] devices.

'''Ginger Page''' operates as an [[online service]] and supports [[Microsoft Word|MS-Word]], [[Microsoft Outlook|MS-Outlook]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint|MS-PowerPoint]], [[Internet Explorer]], [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] and [[Firefox]], and functions as a writing enhancement app for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and iOS mobile devices. Its main feature is the grammar and spelling checker that runs seamlessly with the different [[user interfaces]]. It also has an advanced paraphrasing tool, contextual synonyms and definitions, multi-language translation and a [[text-to-speech]] function that enables users to hear sentences before and after correction.

'''Ginger Keyboard''' for Android replaces the stock keyboard and functions as a productivity boosting keyboard app. Featuring a full set of advanced keyboard features like Stream (swipe-like) typing, adaptive word prediction, a wide variety of customizable themes and emoji, Ginger Keyboard is the only 3rd party keyboard to offer proofreading and other writing tools via one tap access to Ginger Page.

==Target Segment==
Ginger Software started off with people with [[dyslexia]] as its primary target segment. The mathematical algorithm underlying the software studies a vast pool of proper sentences in English and builds a model of proper language. The software does not analyze the text at the level of the word, but of the whole sentence. Dyslectics can have trouble choosing the right word – hence the attention to the sentence as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/israeli-start-up-company-may-have-a-cure-for-dyslexic-typos-1.249855] Israeli start-up company may have a cure for dyslexic typos&lt;/ref&gt; From 2010, Ginger Software included a new target segment in its marketing outreach – users of English as a second language ([[ESL]]). Its contextual-based writing correction tool could benefit those who are not proficient at the English language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gingersoftware.com/sites/default/files/011209%20-%20SecEd%20-%20New%20to%20the%20show.pdf]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} New to the Show&lt;/ref&gt;

With the launch of Ginger Page and Ginger Keyboard, Ginger expanded its target audience to include anyone who writes in English, be they native or ESL.

==Business Model==
Originally the company’s business model was a free 2-day trial followed by an option to purchase the user license after the trial expired. On 15 January 2012, the company changed its business model by releasing its [[freemium]] version. The freemium version consists of the contextual-based grammar and spelling checker which users could download and keep for free. The premium version was also available for purchase. Its features include [http://www.gingersoftware.com/products/text-reader Ginger Text Reader] and [http://www.gingersoftware.com/products/english-personal-trainer Personal Trainer] a progress report analysis tool, along with unlimited access to Grammar Checker, the grammar and spelling checker, and [http://www.gingersoftware.com/products/sentence-rephraser Sentence Rephraser] the rephrasing tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gingersoftware.com/download/] http://www.gingersoftware.com/download/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ginger Keyboard is completely free to download and use, although it does offer in-app purchases like themes and theme packs. It also will disable your original spell checker.

She was daughter of [[Narasimha Chintaman Kelkar]]. She married into a family of illustrious [[Marathi language|Marathi]] literary figures. She was encouraged by her husband to pursue Marathi literature as a profession, and thus fulfill her aspirations. She was a prolific writer who promoted Marathi language and literature. She started Bhagini Mandal, a women's organisation in [[Jalgaon]]. She was the president of the All India Hindu Mahila Parishad in 1935.&lt;ref name="Anagol2005"/&gt;

Her works include ''Purushanche Band'' [Men's Rebellion] and ''Striyanche Swarga'' [Women's Paradise]. Padma Anagol describes her views on women's oppression as complex, which found themselves expressed in her works. According to her, the play ''Purushanche Banda'' was written to "counteract the effects of vilification of Indian women" by [[Krushnaji Prabhakar Khadilkar|Khadilkar]]'s play ''Striyancha Band'' [Women's Rebellion].&lt;ref name="Anagol2005"/&gt; The ''Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature'' describes her work as inspired by [[Hari Narayan Apte|Apte]].

The dialect is [[phonology|phonologically]] peculiar when compared to the other Adyghe sub-dialects. Its lexicon and [[consonant]]al system are substantially affected by the [[Ubykh language]], the [[first language]] of many Hakuchi speakers before its death. Hakuchi Adyghe is one of the most divergent dialects from the literary dialect of Adyghe.

[[Acharya]] '''Hemachandra''' was a [[Jainism|Jain]] scholar, poet, and [[polymath]] who wrote on [[grammar]], philosophy, [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and contemporary history. Noted as a prodigy by his contemporaries, he gained the title ''kalikālasarvajña'', "the all-knowing of the [[Kali Yuga]]".

==Early life==

Hemachandra was born in [[Dhandhuka]], in present-day [[Gujarat]], on Kartika Sud Purnima (the full moon day of Kartika month). His date of birth differs according to sources but 1088 is generally accepted.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The dates of birth and death differs according to sources. He was initiated at age of 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joshi2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dinkar Joshi|title=Glimpses of Indian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fw-0iBvmMAC&amp;pg=PA80|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Star Publications|isbn=978-81-7650-190-3|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Chachiga-deva was a [[Modh]] [[Bania (caste)|Bania]] [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]]. His mother, Pahini, was a [[Jainism|Jain]].&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt6-YXE2aUwC&amp;pg=PA134|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-26606-2|pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amaresh Datta|author2=various|title=The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume One (A To Devo)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&amp;pg=PA15|volume=1|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1803-1|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemchandra's original given name was Changadeva. In his childhood, the [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] Devachandra Suri visited Dhandhuka and was impressed by the young Hemachandra's intellect. His mother and maternal uncle concurred with Devachandra, in opposition to his father, that Hemachandra be a disciple of his. Devachandra took Hemachandra to [[Khambhat]], where Hemachandra was placed under the care of the local governor Udayana. Chachiga came to Udayana's place to take his son back, but was so overwhelmed by the kind treatment he received, that he decided to willingly leave his son with Devachandra.{{sfn|Asoke Kumar Majumdar|1956|p=97}}

Some years later, Hemachandra was initiated a Jain monk on Magha Sud Chauth (4th day of the bright half of Magha month) and was given a new name, Somchandra. Udayana helped Devchandra Suri in the ceremony.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt; He was trained in religious discourse, philosophy, logic and grammar and became well versed in Jain and non–Jain scriptures. At the age of 21, he was ordained an [[acharya]] of the [[Śvētāmbara]] school of Jainism at [[Nagaur]] in present-day [[Rajasthan]]. At this time, he was named Hemachandra Suri.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hema" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.283442|title=The Kumarapalacarita (Prakrta Dvyasraya Kavya) of Hemachandra with commentary of Purnakalashagani|last=|first=|date=|publisher=The Bhandarkar Oriental Institute|others=P.

==Hemachandra and Siddharaja==
[[File:Bust of Acharya Hemachandra.jpg|thumb|Bust of Hemachandra at [[Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University]]]]
At the time, Gujarat was ruled by the [[Chaulukya dynasty]] from [[Patan, Gujarat|Anhilavada]] (Patan). It is not certain when Hemachandra visited Patan for the first time. As Jain monks are [[mendicant]]s for eight months and stay at one place during [[Chaturmas]], the four  monsoon months, he started living at Patan during these periods and produced the majority of his works there.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt;

Probably around 1125, he was introduced to the [[Jayasimha Siddharaja]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1092–1141) and soon rose to prominence in the Chaulukya royal court.&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt; According to the ''Prabhavaka Charita'' of Chandraprabha, the earliest biography of Hemachandra, Jayasimha spotted Hemachandra while passing through the streets of his capital. The king was impressed with an impromptu verse uttered by the young monk.{{sfn|Asoke Kumar Majumdar|1956|p=83}}

In 1135, when the Siddharaja conquered [[Malwa]], he brought the works of [[Bhoja]] from Dhar along with other things. One day Siddhraja came across the manuscript of ''Sarasvati-Kanthabharana'' (also known as the ''Lakshana Prakash''), a treatise on [[Sanskrit grammar]]. He was so impressed by it that he told the scholars  in his court to produce a grammar that was as easy and lucid. Hemachandra requested Siddharaja to find the eight best grammatical treatises from [[Kashmir]]. He studied them and produced a new grammar work in the style of [[Pāṇini]]'s ''Aṣṭādhyāyī''.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt; He named his work ''Siddha-Hema-Śabdanuśāśana'' after himself and the king. Siddharaja was so pleased with the work that he ordered it to be placed on the back of an elephant and paraded through the streets of Anhilwad Patan.&lt;ref name="Meghani2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jhaverchand Meghani]]|title=A Noble Heritage: A Collection of Short Stories Based on the Folklore of Saurashtra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=scNjAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemachandra also composed the ''Dvyashraya Kavya'', an epic on the history of the [[Chaulukya dynasty]], to illustrate his grammar.&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt;

==Hemachandra and Kumarapala==

According to the ''Prabhachandra'', there was an incident where Siddharaja wanted to kill his nephew [[Kumarapala (Chaulukya dynasty)|Kumarapala]] because it was prophesied that the kingdom would meet its demise at Kumarapala's hands. Hemachandra hid Kumarapala under a pile of manuscripts to save him.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"/&gt; However, such motifs are common in Indian folk literature, so it is unlikely it was an actual historical event. Also, many sources differ on Siddharaja's motives.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"/&gt;

Hemachandra became the advisor to Kumarapala.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt; During Kumarapala's reign, Gujarat became a center of culture. Using the Jain approach of ''[[Anekantavada]]'', Hemchandra is said to have displayed a broad-minded attitude, which pleased Kumarapala.&lt;ref name=Hema&gt;{{cite web | title =Hemacandra | publisher =Jain World | url =http://www.jainworld.com/literature/story28.htm | accessdate =6 May 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080429205050/http://www.jainworld.com/literature/story28.htm| archivedate=29 April 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kumarapala was a [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] and ordered the rebuilding of [[Somnath]] at [[Prabhas Patan]]. Some people who were jealous of Hemachandra's rising popularity with the Kumarapala complained that Hemachandra was a very arrogant person, that he did not respect the [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s and that he refused to bow down to [[Shiva]]. When called upon to visit the temple on the inauguration with Kumarapala, Hemachandra readily bowed before the [[lingam]] but said:{{quote|''Bhava Bijankaura-janana Ragadyam Kshayamupagata Yasya, Brahma va Vishnu va Haro Jino va Namastasmai.'' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I bow down to him who has destroyed the passions like attachment and malice which are the cause of the cycle of birth and death; whether he is [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]] or [[Tirthankara|Jina]].&lt;ref name="Hema" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgNHE-48jNcC&amp;pg=PA278|publisher=Global Vision Pub House|isbn=978-81-8220-113-2|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Ultimately, the king became a devoted follower of Hemachandra and a champion of Jainism.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hema" /&gt;

Starting in 1121, Hemachandra was involved in the construction of the [[Jain temple]] at [[Taranga (Jain Temple)|Taranga]]. His influence on Kumarapala resulted in Jainism becoming the official religion of Gujarat and animal slaughter was banned in the state. The tradition of [[animal sacrifice]] in the name of religion was completely uprooted in Gujarat. As a result, even almost 900 years after Hemchandra, Gujarat still continues to be a predominantly [[lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarian]] state, despite having an extensive coastline.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt;

==Death==
He announced about his death six months in advance and fasted in his last days, a Jain practice called ''[[sallekhana]]''. He died at Anhilavad Patan. The year of death differs according to sources but 1173 is generally accepted.&lt;ref name="Joshi2005"/&gt;

==Works==
A prodigious writer, Hemachandra wrote [[grammar]]s of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Prakrit]], [[poetry]], [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], [[lexicons]], texts on [[science]] and [[logic]] and many branches of [[Indian philosophy]]. It is said that Hemachandra composed 3.5 [[crore]] verses in total, many of which are now lost.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Jain philosophy===

His systematic exposition of the Jain path in the [[Yogaśāstra]] and its auto-commentary is a very influential text in Jain thought. According to Olle Quarnström it is "the most comprehensive treatise on [[Svetambara]] [[Jainism]] known to us".&lt;ref&gt;Olle Quarnström, The Yogasastra of Hemacandra : a twelfth century handbook of Svetambara Jainism, 2002, introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===

====''Siddha-Hema-Śabdanuśāśana''====
[[File:Instruction by Monks, Folio from a Jain text of Sanskrit Grammar, the Siddhahemashabdanushasana by Hemachandra (1089-1172) LACMA M.88.62.2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Hemachandra's grammar text ''Siddhahemashabdanushasana'' in Sanskrit]]
This Sanskrit grammar was written in the style of [[Pāṇini]]. It has seven chapters with each chapter having four sections, similar to that of the grammar of [[Bhoja]]. The ''Siddha-Hema-Śabdanuśāśana'' also includes six Prakrit languages: the "standard" [[Prakrit]] (virtually [[Maharashtri Prakrit]]), [[Shauraseni language|Shauraseni]], [[Magahi language|Magahi]], [[Paiśācī]], the otherwise-unattested Cūlikāpaiśācī and [[Apabhraṃśa]] (virtually Gurjar Apabhraṃśa, prevalent in the area of Gujarat and [[Rajasthan]] at that time and the precursor of [[Gujarati language]]). He gave a detailed grammar of Apabhraṃśa and also illustrated it with the folk literature of the time for better understanding. It is the only known Apabhraṃśa grammar.&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt;

===Poetry===

====Dvyashraya Kavya====
To illustrate the grammar, he produced the epic poetry ''Dvyashraya Kavya'' on the history of [[Chaulukya dynasty]]. It is an important source of history of region of the time.&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt;

====Trishashthi-Shalaka-Purusha====
The [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''Trīṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacharitra'' or "Lives of Sixty-Three Great Men" is a [[hagiography|hagiographical treatment]] of the twenty four [[tirthankara]]s and other important persons instrumental in defining the Jain philosophical position, collectively called the "[[Salakapurusa|śalākāpuruṣa]]", their asceticism and eventual liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth, as well as the legendary spread of the Jain influence. It still serves as the standard synthesis of source material for the early history of Jainism.&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt; The appendix to this work, the ''[[Parishishtaparvan|Pariśiṣṭaparvan]]'' or ''Sthavirāvalīcarita'',{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=26}} contains his own commentary and is in itself a treatise of considerable depth&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt; It has been translated into English as ''The Lives of the Jain Elders''.&lt;ref name="HemacandraFynes1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hemacandra|author2=R. C. C. Fynes|title=The Lives of the Jain Elders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=quNpKVqABGMC|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-283227-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other====

His ''Kavyanuprakasha'' follows the model of Kashmiri rhetorician Mammata's ''Kavya-prakasha''. He quoted other scholars like [[Anandavardhana]] and [[Abhinavagupta]] in his works.&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt;

===Lexicography ===
''Abhidhan-Chintamani'' (IAST abhidhāna-cintāmaṇi-kośa)  is a [[lexicon]] while ''Anekarth Kosha'' is a lexicon of words bearing multiple meanings. ''Deshi-Shabda-Sangraho'' or ''Desi-nama-mala'' is the lexicon of local or non-Sanskrit origin. ''Niganthu Sesa'' is a botanical lexicon.&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt;

===Prosody===
He composed the ''Chandonushasana'', a work on [[Metre (poetry)|prosody]], with commentary.
====Mathematics====
[[File:Thirteen ways of arranging long and short syllables in a cadence of length six.png|thumb|Thirteen ways of arranging long and short syllables in a cadence of length six, here shown with [[Cuisenaire rods]] of length 1cm and 2cm]]
Hemachandra, following the earlier Gopala, described [[Fibonacci number#Origins|Fibonacci sequence]] before Fibonacci. The work was presented around 1150, about fifty years before [[Fibonacci]] (1202). He was considering the number of cadences of length ''n'', and showed that these could be formed by adding a short syllable to a cadence of length ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, or a long syllable to one of ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2. This recursion relation ''F''(''n'') = ''F''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) + ''F''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2) is what defines the Fibonacci sequence.&lt;ref name="kosh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tetlow" /&gt;

===Other works===
His other works are a commentary in rhetoric work ''Alankara Chudamani'', ''Abhidhana-chintamani'',&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olle Quarnström (2002), The Yogaśāstra of Hemacandra: A Twelfth Century Handbook of Śvetāmbara Jainism, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674009349}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pramana-mimansa'' (logic), ''Vitaraga-Stotra'' (prayers).&lt;ref name="Dattavarious2006"/&gt;

{{Japanese writing}}
The '''Japanese script reform''' is the attempt to correlate standard spoken Japanese with the written word, which began during the [[Meiji period]]. This issue is known in [[Japan]] as the {{nihongo|''kokugo kokuji mondai''|国語国字問題|national language and script problem}}. The reforms led to the development of the modern Japanese written language, and explain the arguments for official policies used to determine the usage and teaching of [[kanji]] rarely used in Japan.
{{Table Hanzi}}

==History==

===Pre-World War II reforms===
A misconception is held that Japanese script reform originated from the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] during the [[Occupation of Japan]], but in fact, a plan had already been put into place prior to the occupation. Reform efforts date back to at least 1900, and proposals to reform kanji usage had been developed in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In the 1900 spelling reforms, [[hentaigana]] (old variant forms of kana) were eliminated, though [[historical kana orthography]] (dating to the [[Heian period]], a millennium before) was retained. A separate character for ん was also prescribed; previously it had been written as む ('mu') and ん was a hentaigana for both these sounds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} A proposal to eliminate certain kanji from use was implemented in a number of regions and overseas territories in the 1920s, near the end of the [[Taishō period]].

In November 1922, the {{nihongo|''rinji kokugo chōsakai''|臨時国語調査会|Temporary National Language Investigation Committee}}, the precursor to the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs|Japanese Language Council]], now the Japanese Language subdivision of the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]], selected and approved a list of 1,962 kanji characters for daily use. This group of characters formed the basis for the ''[[tōyō kanji]]'' list, which eventually developed into the modern ''[[jōyō kanji]]'' list. In December 1923, the committee approved a set of reforms for kana usage; the prototype for the modern kana system.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Reforms===
The reforms made after the [[Second World War]] have had a particularly significant impact on accepted kanji usage in the modern Japanese language.

On 12 November 1945, the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] newspaper published an editorial concerning the abolition of kanji, and on 31 March 1946, the first American Education Delegation arrived in Japan at the invitation of the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|SCAP]] and issued its first report. The report pointed out the difficulties concerning kanji use, and advocated the use of [[Romanization of Japanese|rōmaji]], which they considered more convenient. As a result, the gradual abolition of kanji became official policy for the SCAP, and the ''tōyō kanji'' list and modern kana usage proposals were drawn up in accordance with this policy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

====''Tōyō kanji''====
The ''[[tōyō kanji]]'' list, containing 1850 characters, was published by the cabinet on 16 November 1946 with the intention of completely abolishing the use of kanji in the future.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} The list reduced the number of kanji deemed appropriate for daily use, and categorized certain kanji for specific use in official publications and documents.

Prior to this reform, an attempt had already been made to simplify several older complex kanji, the ''[[kyūjitai]]'', with new simpler variants, the ''[[shinjitai]]'', but was not conducted with a systematic simplification of elements and [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]]s the way China would develop its [[simplified Chinese character|simplified writing system]] a decade later, though some ''shinjitai kanji'' have even served as the basis for several [[simplified Chinese characters]]. In Japan, changes were only made to complex characters that needed to be abbreviated.

Another separate attempt was made to limit the number of [[Kanji#Readings|kanji readings]], but the first list proved much too restrictive. For instance, the character {{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:魚|魚]]}} had its readings limited to ''gyo'' and ''uo'' when the most common reading, ''sakana,'' was not officially recognized by the list. These shortcomings were acknowledged in the revised list of ''tōyō kanji,'' published on 28 June 1972.

On 5 July 1956, the Japanese Language Council announced a list of substitute characters for words that contained characters not on the official list in an effort to ease the implementation of ''tōyō kanji''. This use of alternative, common kanji in place of rarer ones was called {{nihongo|''kakikae''|書きかえ}}.

Different spellings for words were unified using characters from the ''tōyō kanji'' list. The list below shows some examples, with the non-''tōyō kanji'' placed in brackets.

*{{lang|ja|注文 (註文)}} ''chūmon'' (order, request)
*{{lang|ja|遺跡 (遺蹟)}} ''iseki'' (historic ruins)
*{{lang|ja|更生 (甦生)}} ''kōsei'' (rebirth, originally read ''sosei'', and may be written as 蘇生 to reflect the original reading)
*{{lang|ja|知恵 (智慧)}} ''chie'' (wisdom)
*{{lang|ja|略奪 (掠奪)}} ''ryakudatsu'' (pillage, plunder)
*{{lang|ja|妨害 (妨碍, 妨礙)}} ''bōgai'' (jamming, interference)
*{{lang|ja|意向 (意嚮)}} ''ikō'' (intention, idea)
*{{lang|ja|講和 (媾和)}} ''kōwa'' (reconciliation, peace)
*{{lang|ja|格闘 (挌闘)}} ''kakutō'' (fighting)
*{{lang|ja|書簡 (書翰)}} ''shokan'' (letter, epistle)

Jargon and other specialized words that could be written in more than one way were generally written using characters from the list.
*{{lang|ja|骨格 (骨骼)}} ''kokkaku'' (skeletal structure)
*{{lang|ja|奇形 (畸形)}} ''kikei'' (birth defect)

Other words that used kanji that were not included in the list were given phonetic substitutes.
*{{lang|ja|防御 (防禦)}} ''bōgyo'' (defence)
*{{lang|ja|扇動 (煽動)}} ''sendō'' (abet, agitate)
*{{lang|ja|英知 (叡智)}} ''eichi'' (wisdom)
*{{lang|ja|混交 (混淆)}} ''konkō'' (mix)
*{{lang|ja|激高 (激昂)}} ''gekikō'' (excited, enraged)

For kanji compounds with characters that could not be reasonably substituted, the recommendation was to write the "missing" kanji in kana instead, a practice known as {{nihongo|''[[#Mazegaki|mazegaki]]''|交ぜ書き}}.
*{{lang|ja|皮フ (皮膚)}} ''hifu'' (skin)
*{{lang|ja|たん白質 (蛋白質)}} ''tanpakushitsu'' (protein)

However, the recent prevalence of computers has made it easier for Japanese speakers to identify and use rarer characters, and the idea of having a list of approved characters has come under reconsideration.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} The Japanese media has increasingly used non-approved kanji with [[furigana]] to aid the reader in place of ''mazegaki''.

====Kanji for names====
On 16 February 1948, 881 of the ''tōyō kanji'' were designated to be taught during primary education, and became known as the ''[[kyōiku kanji]]'' (education kanji).

In the same year, Article 50 of the [[family register]] law made it illegal to name a child using characters not on the official list. When this law first came into effect, the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]] declared that all newborn babies must be registered in the ''[[koseki]]'' (the Japanese family registry) with a name that used only [[hiragana]], [[katakana]] or ''tōyō kanji''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} However, in 1951, an additional 92 characters were approved by the government as ''[[jinmeiyō kanji]]''; kanji acceptable for use in names. This list was modified in 1997 to increase to a total of 285 characters. At the time, eight characters from the original ''jinmeiyō kanji'' list were added to the ''[[jōyō kanji]]'' (daily use) list, and were removed from the group of ''jinmeiyō kanji''.

On 27 September 2004, another 488 kanji were approved for use in names, partly as a result of the ruling by the [[Sapporo]] High Court that it was unacceptable for so many common characters to be excluded from use in names simply because they were not part of the official list. 578 characters were initially added, though some characters unsuitable for names such as [[wikt:怨|怨]] (grudge, resent), [[wikt:痔|痔]] (haemorrhoids) and [[wikt:屍|屍]] (corpse) were removed as a result of public feedback.

====Criticisms====
The ''tōyō kanji'' list, which was created as a step towards the abolition of kanji, has undergone frequent criticism by scholars. In 1958, [[Tsuneari Fukuda]] wrote an article in the magazine ''Koe'' pointing out that it was impossible to restrict kanji use, and in 1961, several prominent anti-reformists walked out of the Japanese Language Council general meeting in protest of the dominance of the phoneticists, who were always re-elected to their positions on the council.

The following year, Japanese Language Council member [[Tomizō Yoshida]] argued that the council should base their reforms on standardising the current writing system using a mixture of [[kanji]] and [[kana]], and in 1965, [[Morito Tatsuo]], the then chairman of the council, announced that the complete abolition of kanji was now inconceivable and that Yoshida's suggestion would become official policy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

====Modern kana usage====
On 16 November 1946, [[historical kana usage]] underwent official reform to reflect modern pronunciation as {{nihongo|''gendai kanazukai''|現代かなづかい|modern kana usage}}.  In addition, two kana, ゐ/ヰ ''wi'' and ゑ/ヱ ''we'', were officially declared obsolete, as the pronunciations they represented had dropped from the language many centuries before.

Some reformers wished to eliminate kanji altogether, and have a phonetic written language only using kana, but this was decided against, and further reforms were halted.

Modern kana usage still has one or two incongruities, as reform was halted at an intermediate stage. On 1 July 1985, the government confirmed that no further reforms would be made in the near future.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

*Three [[Japanese particles|particles]] maintain their historical kana form: the topic marker ''wa'' is written {{lang|ja|は}} ''ha'' instead of {{lang|ja|わ}}, the direction marker ''e'' is written {{lang|ja|へ}} ''he'' instead of {{lang|ja|え}} and the object marker ''o'' is written with the otherwise archaic kana {{lang|ja|を}} ''wo'' instead of {{lang|ja|お}}.
*The sounds ''ji'' and ''zu'' are usually written with the kana {{lang|ja|じ}} and {{lang|ja|ず}} respectively, with two exceptions. In compound words of Japanese origin where the second element normally begins ''chi'' or ''tsu'' and is [[rendaku|voiced in the compound]], the kana {{lang|ja|ぢ}} and {{lang|ja|づ}} are used instead. For example, {{lang|ja|鼻血}} ''hanaji'' (nose bleed) consists of [[wikt:鼻|鼻]] ''hana'' (nose) and [[wikt:血|血]] ''chi'' (blood). As ''chi'' is written using the ''kana'' {{lang|ja|ち}}, ''hanaji'' is written はな'''ぢ''', adding a ''[[dakuten]]'' to the original kana to indicate that it is [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]. This is a form of [[morpho-phonemic orthography]], to indicate that it comes from voicing a ち rather than voicing a し or being an unrelated じ.
*ぢ and づ are also used in words of Japanese origin if the preceding kana is the unvoiced form of the same character. For example, the words {{lang|ja|つづく (続く)}} and {{lang|ja|ちぢむ (縮む)}} are written in this manner, though the correct spelling of ''chijimi'' (the Japanese word for the Korean dish ''buchimgae'') is チジミ, as opposed to チヂミ, as the word is not native to the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhk.or.jp/bunken/research/kotoba/kotoba_qa_04110101.html  Chizimi or Chidimi? {{ja icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{lang|ja|ぢ}}  and {{lang|ja|づ}} are never used for words of Chinese origin. The character [[wikt:通|通]] is usually read ''tsū'', but in compounds it may be read as ''zū'' (for instance, {{lang|ja|融通}} ''yūzū'' (flexibility) is written {{lang|ja|ゆう'''ず'''う}}) with no regard to its usual pronunciation.

===Reintroduction of older kanji in mass media===
When reporting the lawsuits against [[Minamata disease]] in 1970, the non-tōyō kanji 怨 ''on'', "grudge", was used to refer to the feelings of the bereaved families. As a result of this widespread coverage, this kanji was reintroduced into popular usage, which opened the door for many more kanji to be rehabilitated.&lt;ref&gt;NHK special 「戦後日本　漢字事件簿」 第3回 常用漢字への軌跡 September 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jōyō kanji'' and the JIS===
The ''[[jōyō kanji]]'' list, consisting at that time of 1945 characters, was published by the Japanese government in 1981 to serve as a replacement for the ''[[tōyō kanji]]'' list. This newer list was based on the older ''tōyō kanji'' list, though ''jōyō kanji'' was more of a guide to kanji usage while ''tōyō kanji'' was created to gradually eliminate kanji usage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Around the same time, the [[Japanese Industrial Standards Committee]] (JIS) also attempted to create a standardised kanji [[character set]] for use in [[computing]] and [[word processor|word processing]], and to assign a unique [[character code]] to each kanji for data processing. This character set was, like the ''jōyō kanji'', merely a subset of the thousands of documented kanji, and became known colloquially as the JIS kanji set. The character set has undergone several revisions since its inception. The first of these, officially known as [[JIS X 0208|JIS C 6226]], or more commonly as the old JIS kanji set, was published in 1978 and contained 6802 characters. After the creation of the ''jōyō kanji'' list in 1983, the old set was expanded to contain 6877 characters, including some non-kanji characters. This is known as the new JIS kanji set, and was designated as [[JIS X 0208]] in 1987.

Approximately 200 characters were changed from their traditional form to their simplified form in the change from the old JIS to the new JIS set, meaning that word documents written on computers using the old character set would not display the same characters when displayed on a computer that used the new character set.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The JIS character set makes no distinction between the forms of characters, so it is not possible to distinguish between traditional and simplified forms. However, some characters, such as [[wikt:剣|剣]], [[wikt:劒|劒]], and [[wikt:劍|劍]], are distinguished within the character set, despite being variations of the same character.

===Gaiji===
Increased use of [[Japanese input methods#Kana to kanji conversion|kana to kanji conversion]] on word processors and computers during the mid-1980s brought drastic changes to the amount of Japanese written by hand. As a result, the use of kanji outside the ''jōyō kanji'' increased, reversing the prior trend of using fewer kanji. These characters were called ''[[Kanji#Gaiji|gaiji]]'' (lit. "outside characters")

The preface to the Japanese Language Council internal report on the ''jōyō kanji'' states that the council's decision on the forms of characters not on the approved list is pending, and will await research from each field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bunka.go.jp/kokugo/main.asp?fl=show&amp;id=1000001413&amp;clc=1000000500&amp;cmc=1000000518&amp;cli=1000001393&amp;cmi=1000001399  Preface to the Japanese Language Council report on ''jōyō kanji'' {{ja icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The new JIS character set [[Extended Shinjitai|extends kanji simplification]] to ''gaiji'', creating a discrepancy between the standard forms of characters used in literature and materials produced on a computer or word processor. There is pressure for the Japanese publishing industry to adopt the new JIS character set abbreviations, and the resulting variation in ''gaiji'' led the Japanese Language Council, in their final report in December 2000, to produce a list of standard forms for many of these kanji to be used as a guideline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bunka.go.jp/kokugo/main.asp?fl=list&amp;id=1000000518&amp;clc=1000000500|Japanese Language Council report{{ja icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; This list is called the {{nihongo|''Hyōgai kanji jitai-hyō''|表外漢字字体表|extra=lit. "Non-listed kanji form list"}} in Japan.

This list was compiled by researching the various gaiji forms used in printed materials, and 1022 major characters were given standard forms to be used in print type face. 22 of these characters were simplified common forms, and the abbreviated forms of three [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]]s were acknowledged as permissible alternatives for these characters. However, the general policy of the list was to use traditional forms for all gaiji.

Though newspaper publishers had been firm advocates for reducing the number of kanji, the release of the ''gaiji'' list forced them to reduce [[Tōyō kanji#Mazegaki|''mazegaki'']] in newspaper print. Subsequent issues of the {{nihongo|''Kisha handobukku shinbun yōji yōgo shū''|記者ハンドブック 新聞用字用語集|extra=lit. "Journalist handbook of newspaper character usage"}} tended to increase the number of permissible characters, so that former ''mazegaki'' words could be written as kanji (for example, the use of "拉致" in place of "ら致" or "危惧" in place of "危ぐ").{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} As newspapers began to use computerised typesetting, some newspapers reintroduced [[ruby character]]s to indicate the reading of uncommon kanji. Though not a unified movement, there was a general trend towards increased kanji use. Other mass media organizations followed suit, and the {{nihongo|NHK shin yōji yōgo jiten|NHK 新用字用語辞典|extra=lit. [[NHK]]'s dictionary of new character usage}} also reduced the amount of ''mazegaki'' used.

There were substantial discrepancies between the ''gaiji'' list and JIS forms, but these discrepancies were corrected in 2004 with the release of [[JIS X 0213]], which brought the JIS in line with the Japanese Language Council. The changes in [[jinmeiyō kanji]] made by the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]] during the same year also conformed to this standard printed form, with [[wikt:芦|芦]] being an exception. Computers have also moved towards a standard form following the printed character forms. However, JIS X 0213 subsumes personal place names and other proper nouns that were excluded from the ''gaiji'' list, so confusion may still result for characters like [[wikt:辻|辻]], where the character form differs between the printed standard and naming standard.

''[[Jōyō kanji]]'' and ''[[jinmeiyō kanji]]'' (list as of 2000) were not included on the ''gaiji'' list, so the standards for those characters are the forms used in the jinmeiyō kanji list. Similarly, [[wikt:曙|曙]] and [[wikt:蓮|蓮]], which were added to the jinmeiyō kanji list in 1990, remain the standards forms for the same reason, even though traditional forms exist for those characters (a dot in the middle of 者 for 曙, and a double-dotted radical for 蓮). These kanji remained unchanged in the alterations made to the list in 2004. On the other hand, the characters 堵 and 逢, which were added to the jinmeiyō kanji list in 2004, do have a standard printed form with a dot in the middle of 者 and two dots on the radical, and were amended accordingly in JIS X 0213.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Historical advocates for reform==
The use of kanji as part of Japanese orthography has been a matter of debate since at least the end of the [[Edo period]]. The use of kanji has been criticised for various reasons, the main criticisms being:
*There are too many kanji, and it is difficult to remember how to read and write them.
*The [[Latin alphabet]] is used internationally, and using kanji separates Japan from the rest of the world. This argument was used from a technical point of view after the appearance of the [[typewriter]] and computer.
*Processing kanji is more time consuming on word processors and computers
*Text that uses a mixture of kanji and kana requires [[Japanese input methods#Kana to kanji conversion|kanji conversion]], which is inefficient in comparison to text that only uses kana or rōmaji.

These criticisms led to arguments that reduction or eradication of kanji was a matter of national interest. The idea of abolishing kanji is often referenced to [[Maejima Hisoka]]'s report titled {{nihongo|''Kanji onhaishi no gi''|漢字御廃止之議|extra=lit. "The argument for the abolition of kanji"}}, which was submitted to the ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] in 1866. The report argued that kanji should be abolished because the process of learning kanji was inefficient; however, in recent years the existence of this report has come into question,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} and further investigation was made into the subject in a graduation thesis for the department of literary history at [[Risshō University]] in 1999. Other advocates of kanji reform include the following:

*[[Kamo no Mabuchi]], {{nihongo|''Kokuikō''|国意考}}
:Critical of the number of kanji, and argued that kana were more convenient because they were phonetic characters like the alphabet. Notes that a [[French language|French]] dictionary was written using only 50 characters, and that [[Dutch language|Dutch]] uses only 25 characters.
*[[Motoori Norinaga]], {{nihongo|''Tamakatsuma''|玉勝間}}
*[[Fukuzawa Yukichi]], {{nihongo|''Moji no Oshie''|文字之教|extra= lit. "The teaching of characters"}} (1873)
*[[Maejima Hisoka]], {{nihongo|''Kanji Gohaishi no Gi''|漢字御廃止之儀|extra=lit. "The argument for the abolition of kanji"}} (1866)
*[[Nishi Amane]], {{nihongo|''Yōji o motte kokugo o shosuru no ron''|洋字ヲ以テ国語ヲ書スルノ論|extra=lit. "Argument for writing Japanese in western script"}} (advocating the use of rōmaji)
*[[Suematsu Kenchō]], {{nihongo|''Nihon Bunshōron''|日本文章論|extra=lit. "Japanese syntax"}} (1886)
*[[Ueda Kazutoshi]]
*[[Mori Arinori]], {{nihongo|''Nihon no Kyōiku''|日本の教育|extra=lit. "Japanese education"}}  (Advocating the use of English)
*[[Nanbu Yoshikazu]] (Advocated the use of rōmaji)
*[[Baba Tatsui]], {{nihongo|''Nihongo Bunten''|日本語文典|extra= lit. "Japanese grammar"}}
*[[Shiga Naoya]], {{nihongo|''Kokugo Mondai''|国語問題|extra=lit. "The language problem"}} (Advocating the use of French) (''Kaizō'' magazine, April, 1946)

The romaji issue is still occasionally pushed by fringe writers, for example the 2011 book {{nihongo|"Kanji is the ruin of Japanese"|漢字が日本語をほろぼす|Kanji ga Nihongo wo horobosu}} by [[Katsuhiko Tanaka]] ([[:ja:田中克彦|田中克彦]]).

==Current issues==

===''Character-Related Issue''===
Current opinion favors the inclusion of the character 碍 under the Jōyō Kanji list in order to promote the more positive word for handicapped person, 障碍者, because the current word for handicapped, 障害者, uses the character 害, which has a secondary derogatory meaning of "harm or evil influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=明彦 (Akihiko) | last=白石 (Shiroishi) | script-title=ja:「障害者」か「障碍者」か　「碍（がい）」を常用漢字に追加求め意見 | date=2010-04-05 | url =http://www.asahi.com/culture/news_culture/TKY201004050103.html | work =Asahi Shimbun | accessdate = 2010-04-06 | language = Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mazegaki''===
The current issue of ''[[mazegaki]],'' mixing kanji and kana to write a single word, originated with the modern reforms, particularly the introduction of the ''tōyō kanji'' list. Though the intention was to have words requiring characters that were not included on the list to be substituted with a suitable synonym, in reality, the rule was circumvented by writing these kanji in kana and making ''mazegaki'' commonplace. One of the most commonly seen examples is 宝くじ (''takara-kuji'' lottery), which is traditionally written 宝籤. Foods commonly written either just in kana or in mazegaki include 醤油／しょう油 (''shōyu'' soya sauce) and 味噌 (''[[miso]]''). Other words commonly written as ''mazegaki'' include 改ざん, 破たん, 隠ぺい, 漏えい, 覚せい剤, and 団らん where the traditional forms are 改竄, 破綻, 隠蔽, 漏洩, 覚醒剤, and 団欒 respectively. Note that in some cases the unused kanji is very complicated (欒 has 23 strokes), while in other cases the character may be relatively simple but not on the official list (e.g. 洩 has only 9 strokes). This is also common for medical terms, which often use rare kanji, as in 骨粗しょう症 for 骨粗鬆症.

''Mazegaki'' is not enforced and is rarely used in literature, where traditional forms are often used, although it is common in media outlets such as newspapers and television broadcasts, since non-Jōyō kanji are not supposed to be used in these contexts. In extreme cases, ''[[jōyō kanji]]'' may be written in this way in television programmes or manga aimed at younger children or language learners – for example 友達 (''tomodachi'' "friend") may be written as 友だち. ''Mazegaki'' may also be used in signs, possibly as katakana – for example, 皮膚科 (''hifuka'' dermatologist) may be written as 皮フ科 to improve legibility from a distance.

At the time of the introduction of the ''tōyō kanji'' list, the use of [[ruby character]]s, also known as [[furigana]], led to high printing costs for newspaper companies due to difficulties in typesetting, and ''mazegaki'' eliminated the need for furigana.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} The resulting reduction in printing costs gave the restriction or abolition of kanji serious economic advantages for newspaper companies, and they became heavily involved in decisions made by the Japanese Language Council.

===''Kakikae''===
The use of common kanji in place of uncommon ones with the same reading is known as ''kakikae'' ("changed writing"). One of the most common examples is the use of 才 instead of 歳, both pronounced ''sai,'' when writing ages, as in 10才 rather than 10歳. Another common example is 抽籤 ''chūsen'' (lottery), which is often written as 抽選, in addition to the mazegaki 抽せん mentioned above. A rarer example is the word 沈澱 ''chinden'' 'settlement (of sediment)', which is a combination of the characters 沈 'to sink' and 澱 'sediment', so the meaning is evident from the kanji. However, in modern writing the uncommon character 澱 has been substituted with 殿 'Mr, lord' (omitting the 3-stroke water radical on the left), a similar character with the same pronunciation but a different meaning, yielding the combination 沈殿, which could now be construed to mean 'sinking lord'.

Various hybrid simplifications also exist, using simpler non-standard characters. This is generally used in handwriting instead of print, and these characters are known as ''[[ryakuji]]'' ("abbreviated characters"). For example, replacing 闘 with 斗, both pronounced ''to,'' is ''kakikae,'' as these are both standard characters, but replacing 闘 with the non-standard character 閗 (門斗: 斗 contained in 門) is a ''ryakuji''.

===Controversy on ''mazegaki'' and ''kakikae''===
Advocates of the method explain that it makes content easier to read and will attract a wider audience, while critics argue that it is sloppy and erodes traditional culture. Further, mazegaki is criticized because in some respects it makes the text more difficult to read, as it is not clear that the hiragana are part of a content word, and not [[okurigana]] or performing a grammatical function (inflection or particles).

As they are phonetic substitutions, one of the problems with using ''mazegaki'' and ''kakikae'' is that the original meaning of the word is not clear from the characters. Kanji have both sound and meaning, and most compounds are created by combining both ([[ateji]] use only sound, however). For example, the 破 of 破たん ''hatan'' means 'rip', but the たん is kana ''tan'' and does not carry any meaning. Furthermore, ''mazegaki'' may cause problems in discerning the intended reading; for example, the word 真摯 ''shinshi'' ("sincerity"), when written as 真し, may be misconstrued as *''mashi'' or *''masashi'', causing momentary confusion.

Although there are some examples where ''kakikae'' uses a simpler character with a similar or related meaning and is generally not criticized, for the most part the substitutions have been purely phonetic and the practices of ''mazegaki'' and ''kakikae'' have been criticised for legitimising sloppy Japanese and eroding part of Japanese culture.

===Variant characters in Microsoft Windows===
In 2005, [[Microsoft]] announced that the fonts [[Meiryo]], [[MS Gothic]], and [[MS Mincho]] in the [[Microsoft Windows Vista|Windows Vista]] operating system would comply with JIS X 0213:2004. Though this removed incompatibilities with the accepted ''gaiji'' forms in the Windows environment, it did raise concerns that the characters would be displayed differently depending on the version of Windows system used, re-creating the problems that occurred in the shift from the old to new JIS character set. Microsoft allayed these fears by announcing that the standard Japanese fonts on Vista would be [[OpenType]] compatible, and old character forms could also be used by converting between variant forms. In actuality, the [[Adobe Systems]] applications [[Adobe InDesign|InDesign]], [[Adobe Illustrator|Illustrator]] and the [[JustSystems]] application [[Ichitaro]] allow conversion of variant forms in software that have full support for OpenType.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ddc.co.jp/mt/words/archives/20050916111011.html  Converting between variant forms in Adobe Illustrator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justsystems.com/jp/products/ichitaro/feature1.html#h3_02  Converting between variant forms in Ichitaro]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are few other applications released for Windows Vista that support OpenType, and [[Microsoft Office 2007|Office 2007]] does not support conversion of variant kanji forms.

'''Kamwe''' is a [[Chadic language]] spoken in [[Adamawa State]], Borno State in [[Nigeria]] and North Western Cameroon.

The Kamwe people and language are sometimes called '''Higi''' (Higgi).  Kamwe elders say this is a derogatory name, given to the Kamwe by their relatives the [[Marghi people|Margi]], that literally means "grasshopper". The Margi first called the Kamwe people "Higi" in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Tribal Studies in Northern Nigeria. C.K Meek 1931&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nigeria about 80 percent of Kamwe are found in [[Michika|Michika Local Government Area]] of Adamawa State Nigeria, a substantial number of them are also found in the local government areas of [[Mubi North]], [[Hong, Nigeria|Hong]], [[Gombi]], [[Song]] and [[Madagali]] in Adamawa State. The Kamwe people are also found in [[Borno State]], especially in  [[Askira/Uba]] and Gwoza local government areas.

==Dialects==
Kamwe dialects include Nkafa, Dakwa, Krghea (sometimes called Higgi Fali), Fwea, Humsi, Modi, Sina, and Tilyi; Blench (2006) considers [[Psikye language|Psikye]] to be another.&lt;ref&gt;Blench, 2006. [http://rogerblench.info/Language/Afroasiatic/General/AALIST.pdf The Afro-Asiatic Languages: Classification and Reference List] (ms)&lt;/ref&gt;  Nkafa is well understood by all and is widely spoken, being the main language of administration and commerce, and having a literary tradition.  It is natively spoken by the clans of Kwache, Kwaga, Kwabe, Kwaya and Kwaghe. The other Nkafa clans are Kwaha and Kwabuggi. (The Nkafa clans are said to descend from brothers [from the same mother] who migrated to Nkafamiya together from Ghye.{{clarify|date=March 2015}}  Other dialects of Kamwe are also divided into clans. For example, Tlowou is spoken by the clans Mbammi, Nyahuo, Nka, Zharawa, Towoo, Ngulvi and Mihalyi.

==People==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Most Kamwe identify themselves with Mwe-ci-ka (Michika), the ancestral home of all Kamwe people. Kamwe literally means people of the "Heavenly realms or people of the Rocks and Hill". The Kamwe people believe in a heavenly God called 'Hyalatamwe' Communication with Hyalatamwe directly is not possible in Kamwe culture. Hyalatamwe is revered and feared. Communication with him has to be through intermediaries called "Da melie or Tchuhye shwa" 
In the Kamwe culture, caste system does exist as the Kamwe race is broadly classified into 'Melie and Ka-Ligyi'.
The founder of Michika (Mwe-ci-ka) was said to be one Kwada Kwakaa, a prince from Kuli in Nkafamiya on the hills of Michika. Kwada Kwakaa was said to be a warrior hunter who could hunt lions and leopards just by himself.  When his father, who was the King in Nkafamiya, got to know that Kwada was 'kwa' 'kaa',{{&lt;ref&gt;Oral Interview with Shi Mairama Wape 1991&lt;/ref&gt;}} he mandated Kwada to be the ruler in the present day Michika.

A first-born male child is named ''Tizhe'', a first-born female child ''Kuve''. The first ten children in Kamwe culture are named as follows:- First male child is Tizhe, the female child is Kuve. The second male child is Zira, the female is Masi. The third male child is Tumba, the female is Kwarramba, the fourth male child is Vandi, the female is Kwanye. The fifth child is Kwaji whether male or female. The sixth child is Tari for male and Kwata for female. The seventh child is sini for male and Kwasini for female. The eight child is Kwada for both male and Female. The ninth child is Drambi for both the male and female. The tenth child is called Kwatri for both the male and female child. Subsequently any other child will have a suffix "hale" attached to the name signifying that the child was born in old age of the mother. Example is Kuve-hale or Zira-hale as the case may be.
Twins or multiple births are celebrated in Kamwe culture.
To enhance cultural renaissance in Kamweland, annual cultural festival tagged "Kamwe People Annual Cultural Festival of Art and Culture has been staged in Michika Adamawa State Nigeria every First (1st) Saturday in the month of April every year since 2017. It is aimed at reviving the rich culture of the Kamwe people and attracts tourists from far and near.
During the maiden edition in 2017, a book tilted the 'Kamwe People of Northern Nigeria: Origin, History and Culture was presented to the public.

'''Kursenieki language'''&lt;ref name="Kiseliunaite"/&gt; (Kursenieki: ''Kursisk valuod''; {{lang-lv|Kursenieku valoda}}) or '''Couronian language of Couronian isthmus'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Skujiņa|first=Valentīna|year=2007|title=Valodniecības pamatterminu skaidrojošā vārdnīca |url=http://termini.lza.lv/term.php?term=kursenieku%20valoda |location=Riga |publisher=Latvian Language Agency|page=|isbn=978-99-849-8369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|Nehrungskurisch}} – 'Spit Curonian') is a dialect of the [[Latvian language]] spoken by the [[Kursenieki]] of the [[Curonian Spit]], a thin strip of land stretching between southwestern Lithuania and Russia. In the process of various migrations of the 14th–17th centuries, [[Curonians]] (already speaking a Latvian dialect) settled along the Curonian Spit in [[East Prussia]] and became known as [[Kursenieki]].

[[Image:Curonians kursenieki in 1649.png|thumb|left|200px|In 1649 settlement of the Kursenieki language speaking Kursenieki spanned from [[Klaipėda|Memel (Klaipėda)]] to [[Gdańsk|Danzig (Gdańsk)]] in [[Poland]].]]
Kursenieki language was influenced by [[Old Prussian]], [[Low German Language|Low German]], [[German language|High German]] and [[Samogitian dialect|the Samogitian dialect]] successively, and by the end of the 18th century new Curonian dialects had formed, with the dialect of the Curonian Spit being notably distinct, due to its isolation from the mainland. Kursenieki vocabulary published in 1927 shows: 60% of Curonian words were the same as Latvian, 26% were loanwords from “German” (i.e. Low German and High German), and 13% from Lithuanian dialects. The Kursenieki language is [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with Latvian, especially with its southwestern dialects, and Latvians can communicate easily with Kursenieki today.&lt;ref&gt;Pietsch, Richard: Deutsch-Kurisches Wörterbuch, Verlag Nordostdeutsches Kulturwerk Lüneburg 1991, p.17, {{ISBN|3-922296-60-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[World War II]], the Kursenieki language was a [[sociolect]] of Curonian fishermen of the Curonian Spit. In other spheres of everyday life Kursenieki used the Low German and High German languages.  
The events of the first half of the 20th century, including the Soviet and German [[Occupation of Baltic states|occupations of the Baltic states]] and later [[East Prussia]], led to the near extinction of the language, making it [[endangered language|severely endangered]]. Several remaining native speakers live in [[Germany]], having been [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] as "Germans" in the [[Evacuation of East Prussia|ethnic cleansing that took place in East Prussia]] after [[World War II]].

It shows "Mr. [[Solid South]]" writing on wall, "Eddikashun qualifukashun. The Blak man orter be eddikated afore he kin vote with us Wites, signed Mr. Solid South."]]
A '''literacy test''' assesses a person's [[literacy]] skills: their ability to read and write. Literacy tests have been administered by various governments to immigrants. In the United States, between the 1850s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connecticuthistory.org/literacy-tests-and-the-right-to-vote/|title=Literacy Tests and the Right To Vote - ConnecticutHistory.org|author=|date=|website=connecticuthistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1960s, literacy tests were administered to prospective voters, and this had the effect of disenfranchising African Americans and others.

==Voting==

From the 1890s to the 1960s, many state governments in the [[Southern United States|United States]] administered literacy tests to prospective voters purportedly to test their literacy in order to vote. In practice, these tests were intended to disenfranchise racial minorities. Southern state legislatures employed literacy tests as part of the voter registration process starting in the late 19th century. Literacy tests, along with [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency and property restrictions and extra-legal activities (violence, intimidation)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crmvet.org/info/lithome.htm|title=Civil Rights Movement -- Literacy Tests &amp; Voter Applications|author=|date=|website=www.crmvet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; were all used to deny suffrage to [[African Americans]]. The first formal voter literacy tests were introduced in 1890.  At first, whites were generally exempted from the literacy test if they could meet alternate requirements that in practice excluded blacks, such as a [[grandfather clause]] or a finding of "good moral character"

In ''[[Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections]]'' (1959), the U.S. Supreme Court held that literacy tests were not necessarily violations of Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment nor of the Fifteenth Amendment. Southern states abandoned the literacy test only when forced to do so by federal legislation in the 1960s. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] provided that literacy tests used as a qualification for voting in federal elections be administered wholly in writing and only to persons who had completed six years of formal education.

In part to curtail the use of literacy tests, Congress enacted the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. The Act prohibited jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to citizens who attained a sixth-grade education in an American school in which the predominant language was Spanish, such as schools in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 4(e); {{usc|52|10303(e)}} (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(e))&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court upheld this provision in ''[[Katzenbach v. Morgan]]'' (1966). Although the Court had earlier held in ''Lassiter'' that literacy tests did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections]]'', {{ussc|360|45|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Morgan'' the Court held that Congress could enforce Fourteenth Amendment rights—such as the right to vote—by prohibiting conduct it deemed to interfere with such rights, even if that conduct may not be independently unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buss|first=William G.|title=Federalism, Separation of Powers, and the Demise of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act|journal=Iowa Law Review|date=January 1998|volume=83| pages=405–406|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/ilr83&amp;div=19|accessdate=January 7, 2014}} {{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Katzenbach v. Morgan]]'', {{ussc|384|641|1966}}, pp. 652–656&lt;/ref&gt;

As originally enacted, the Voting Rights Act also suspended the use of literacy tests in all jurisdictions in which less than 50% of voting-age residents were registered as of November 1, 1964, or had voted in the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]]. In 1970, Congress amended the Act and expanded the ban on literacy tests to the entire country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Richard A.|title=The 1982 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act: A Statutory Analysis of the Revised Bailout Provisions|journal=Washington University Law Review| year=1984| volume=62| issue=1| pages=5–9| url=http://digitalcommons.law.wustl.edu/lawreview/vol62/iss1/2/|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court then upheld the ban as constitutional in ''[[Oregon v. Mitchell]]'' (1970), but just for federal elections. The Court was deeply divided in this case, and a majority of justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tok ji|first=Daniel P.|title=Intent and Its Alternatives: Defending the New Voting Rights Act|journal=Alabama Law Review|year=2006|volume=58|page=353|url=http://www.law.ua.edu/pubs/lrarticles/Volume%2058/Issue%202/tokaji.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oregon v. Mitchell]]'', {{ussc|400|112|1970}}, pp. 188–121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration==

The literacy test was a device to restrict the total number of immigrants while not offending the large element of ethnic voters.  The "old" immigration (British, Irish, German, Scandinavian) had fallen off and was replaced by a "new" immigration from Italy, Russia and other points in Southern and eastern Europe. The "old" immigrants were voters and strongly approved of restricting the "new" immigrants.  All groups of American voters strongly opposed Chinese and Asian immigration.  The 1896 Republican platform called for a literacy test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brian |last=Gratton |chapter=Demography and Immigration Restriction in American History |editor-first=Jack A. |editor-last=Goldstone |title=Political Demography: How Population Changes Are Reshaping International Security and National Politics |year=2011 |pages=159–75 |isbn=978-0-19-994596-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Federation of Labor]] took the lead in promoting literacy tests that would exclude illiterate immigrants, primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe.  A majority of the labor union membership were immigrants or sons of immigrants from Germany, Scandinavia and Britain, but the literacy test would not hinder immigration from those countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. T. |last=Lane |title=American Trade Unions, Mass Immigration and the Literacy Test: 1900–1917 |journal=Labor History |year=1984 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=5–25 |doi=10.1080/00236568408584739 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate industry however, needed new workers for its mines and factories and opposed any restrictions on immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Claudia |last=Goldin |chapter=The political economy of immigration restriction in the United States, 1890 to 1921 |title=The regulated economy: A historical approach to political economy |publisher=U. of Chicago Press |year=1994 |pages=223–258 |isbn=0-226-30110-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the House Speaker [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]], a conservative Republican, worked aggressively to defeat a proposed literacy test for immigrants. A product of the western frontier, Cannon felt that moral probity was the only acceptable test for the quality of an immigrant. He worked with Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]] and President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to set up the "[[Dillingham Commission]]," a blue ribbon body of experts that produced a 41-volume study of immigration. The Commission recommended a literacy test and the possibility of annual quotas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert F. |last=Zeidel |title=Hayseed Immigration Policy: 'Uncle Joe' Cannon and the Immigration Question |journal=Illinois Historical Journal |year=1995 |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=173–188 |jstor=40192956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presidents Cleveland and Taft vetoed literacy tests in 1897 and 1913. President Wilson did the same in 1915 and 1917, but the test was passed over Wilson's second veto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Bischoff|title=Immigration Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z55TNEvNX-UC&amp;pg=PA156|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the [[first language]] of nearly 10,000 people on the island of [[Minicoy]] in the [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], India, where the Mahl dialect of the Maldivian language is spoken.

Maldivian is closely related to the [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] language of [[Sri Lanka]].

The ethnic [[exonym and endonym|autonym]] for the language, ''Divehi'', is occasionally found in English as ''Dhivehi'' (spelled according to the locally used [[Malé Latin]] for romanization of the Maldivian language), which is the official spelling as well as the common usage in the [[Maldives]]. Maldivian is written in the [[Thaana]] script.

The major dialects of Maldivian are ''Malé'', ''Huvadhu'', ''Mulaku'', ''Addu'', ''Haddhunmathee'', and ''Maliku''. The standard form of Maldivian is Malé, which is spoken in the Maldivian capital [[Malé|of the same name]]. The Maliku dialect spoken in Minicoy is officially referred to as ''Mahl'' by the Lakshadweep administration. This has been adopted by many authors when referring to Maldivian spoken in Minicoy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.mv/books?id=qG-9cwHOcCIC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=mahl+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=emruTIf-KqGU4gaa4YjiCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&amp;q=mahl%20dialect&amp;f=false |title=Frommer's India – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.mv |date=2010-02-18 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.mv/books?id=8xkJAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=mahl+dialect&amp;dq=mahl+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kGjuTNO1L4OfOoe0ncAK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBDgU |title=Journal of the Bombay Natural ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.mv |date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.mv/books?id=F2SRqDzB50wC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;dq=mahl+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kGjuTNO1L4OfOoe0ncAK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=mahl%20dialect&amp;f=false |title=Concise encyclopedia of languages of ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.mv |date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maldivian is a descendent of [[Elu|Elu Prakrit]] and is closely related to the [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] language, but not mutually intelligible with it. Many languages have influenced the development of the Maldivian language through the ages, most importantly [[Arabic]]. Others include [[French language|French]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], and English. The English words ''[[atoll]]'' (a ring of coral islands or reefs) and ''[[dhoni]]'' (a vessel for inter-atoll navigation) are anglicised forms of the Maldivian words ''{{transl|dv|atoḷu}}'' and ''{{transl|dv|dōni}}''.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word "Divehi" is ''Div''+''vehi'' meaning "Islanders" (from [[Sanskrit]] [[Dvīpa]]). ''Bas'' means "language" (from Sanskrit [[Bhāṣā]]), so ''{{transl|dv|Divehi-bas}}'' means "Islanders' language". [[Harry Charles Purvis Bell]], one of the first Dhivehi linguists, called it ''Divehi''. This was consistent with ''Maldives'', the name of the country, for the ''-dives'' of ''Maldives'' and the word ''Divehi'' have the same root, [[Old Indo-Aryan]] ''dvīpa'' "island".

[[Wilhelm Geiger]], a German linguist who undertook the first research on Maldivian [[linguistics]] in the early 20th century, also called the language ''Divehi''. An ''h'' was added to the name of the language— "Dhivehi"— in 1976, when the semi-official transliteration called [[Malé Latin]] was developed. Today the spelling with an ''h'' is both common and official usage in the Maldives.

==Origin==
Maldivian is an Indo-Aryan language closely related to the Sinhalese language of [[Sri Lanka]]. Maldivian represents the southernmost Indo-Aryan language. Together with Sinhala, Maldivian represents a subgroup within the Modern Indo-Aryan languages which is called [[Insular Indo-Aryan]]. However, Sinhala and Maldivian are not mutually intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go2081/is_3_127/ai_n31523541/ | work=The Journal of the American Oriental Society | title=The Dhivehi Language: A Descriptive and Historical Grammar of Dhivehi and Its Dialects. 2 vols | first=James W. | last=Gair | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maldivian is descended from the [[Maharashtri Prakrit]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} of ancient and medieval India. These Prakrits were originally derived from Old Indo-Aryan vernaculars related to [[Vedic Sanskrit]].

Whereas earlier it was believed that Maldivian was a descendant of the Sinhalese language, in 1969 Sinhalese philologist M. W. S. de Silva for the first time proposed that Maldivian and Sinhalese have branched off from a common mother language.&lt;ref name="de Silva"&gt;de Silva (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Loamaafaanu.jpg|thumb|12th-century ''{{transl|dv|[[lōmāfānu]]}}'', copper plates in which early Maldivian sultans wrote orders and grants]]

Maldivian has a continuous written history of about eight hundred years. The earliest writings were on the ''{{transl|dv|[[lōmāfānu]]}}'' (copper-plate [[Conveyancing|grants]]) of the 12th and 13th centuries. Early inscriptions on coral stone have also been found. The oldest inscription found to date is an inscription on a coral stone, which is estimated to be from around the 7th or 8th century.

Maldivian is an Indo-Aryan language of the Sinhalese-Maldivian subfamily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Language: Dhivehi|url=http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/dhiv1236|website=Glottolog|publisher=[[Glottolog]]|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It developed in relative isolation from other languages until the 12th century. Since the 16th century, Maldivian has been written in a unique script called [[Thaana]] which is written from [[right to left]], like those of [[Aramaic script|Aramaic]] and [[Arabic script|Arabic]] (with which it shares several common diacritics for vowel sounds).

The foundation of the historical linguistic analysis of both Maldivian and [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] was laid by [[Wilhelm Geiger]] (1856–1943). In Geiger's comparative study of Maldivian and Sinhalese, he assumes that Maldivian is a dialectal offspring of Sinhalese and therefore is a "daughter language" of Sinhalese. However, the material he collected was not sufficient to judge the "degree of relationship" of Maldivian and Sinhalese.

Geiger concludes that Maldivian must have split from Sinhalese not earlier that the 10th century CE. However, there is nothing in the history of these islands or Sinhalese chronicles, even in legendary form, that alludes to a migration of Sinhalese people which results such a connection.

Vitharana suggests that Maldivian did not evolve as a separate language to Sinhalese until the 12th century CE.&lt;ref name=Vitharana&gt;Vitharana (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; But Reynolds and others{{who|date=March 2017}} have suggested that Maldivian started showing indications of divergence as early as the 4th century CE.{{citation needed| date= July 2016}}

De Silva proposes that Maldivian and Sinhalese must have branched off from a common mother language. He says that "the earliest Indic element in Maldivian is not so much a result of branching off from Sinhalese as a result of a simultaneous separation with Sinhalese from the Indic languages of the mainland of India", referring to Dravidian influences seen in the Maldivian language, such as in old place names.

De Silva's theory is supported by the legend of Prince Vijaya as told in the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', because if this legend is to be believed, the migration of Indo-Aryan colonists to the Minicoy, Maldives and Sri Lanka from the mainland (India) must have taken place simultaneously. This means that Maldivian and Sinhalese must be "sister languages" that developed from a common Prakrit.{{citation needed| date= July 2016}}

Whatever the origin of Maldivian, linguists agree that Maldivian is an Indo-Aryan language which also has older Indic elements in it.

A rare Maliku Thaana primer written in Maldivian published by Lakshadweep's administration during the time of [[Rajiv Gandhi]]'s rule was reprinted by Spanish researcher [[Xavier Romero-Frias]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/4681688/Maliku_Taana-Devana_Foiy |title=Minicoy Language Primer (Maliku Taana - Devana Foiy) |accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a holiday, the ''Dhivehi Language Day'', which is celebrated in the Maldives on 14 April, the birthday of the writer [[Husain Salaahuddin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anydayguide.com/calendar/1898|access-date = 3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
Most speakers of Maldivian live in the [[Maldives]], where it is the national language of the island-nation. Maldivian is also spoken in [[Minicoy|Minicoy Island]] in the [[Union Territory]] of [[Lakshadweep]], India, while a few have migrated to [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kochi (India)|Kochi]] and elsewhere in the state of [[Kerala]].{{citation needed| date= July 2016}}

===Official status===
Maldivian is the official language of [[Maldives]] and a semi-official language in the [[Union Territory]] of [[Lakshadweep]], India.

===Dialects===
Due to the wide distribution of the islands, differences in pronunciation and vocabulary have developed during the centuries. The mainstream form of Maldivian is known as ''Malé Bas'' and is based on the dialect spoken in the capital of the Maldives.

The most divergent dialects of the language are to be found in the southern atolls, namely [[Huvadhu]], [[Fuvahmulah]] and [[Addu Atoll|Addu]]. Slighter variants are spoken in [[Haddhunmathi Atoll|Haddhunmathi]] and in [[Minicoy|Minicoy (Maliku)]] where ''Haddhunmathee Bas'' and ''Maliku Bas'' (''Mahl'') are spoken respectively. The dialect spoken in Minicoy has fewer differences from the standard Maldivian than other dialects. Among the dialects, ''Malé Bas'' and ''Maliku Bas'' are most similar. The other variants show much difference including the dialects spoken in a few islands in [[Kolhumadulu Atoll|Kolhumadulu]], which are hardly recognised and known.

''Mulaku Bas'' is a dialect of Maldivian spoken by the people of [[Fuvahmulah]]. ''Mulaku Bas'' has word-final 'l' (''laamu sukun'' {{lang|dv|ލް}}), which is absent from the other dialects of Maldivian. Another characteristic is the 'o' sound at the end of words, instead of the final 'u' common in all other forms of Maldivian; e.g. 'fanno' instead of 'fannu'. Regarding pronunciation, the retroflex 'ṣ' (IPA [ʂ]), which has almost a slight 'r' sound in mainstream Maldivian, becomes 'š' (IPA [ʃ]) in ''Mulaku Bas'', sounding like {{lang-ar|ش}} ''shīn''. One of the most unusual features of ''Mulaku Bas'' is that, unlike other dialects, it distinguishes gender. Also, there are many remarkable differences in the dialect in place of the ''[[#sukun|Sukun]]'' system as well as the vowel or diacritical system following a distinctive set of rules.

''Huvadhu Bas'', spoken by the inhabitants of the large atoll of [[Huvadhu Atoll|Huvadhu]], is another distinctive form of Maldivian. Because of the isolation from the Northern Atolls, and the capital of Malé, ''Huvadhu Bas'' compared to other variants makes more use of the retroflex /ʈ/. ''Huvadhu Bas'' also retains old [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] words and is sometimes considered to be linguistically closer to Sinhala than the other dialects of Maldivian.

''Addu Bas'' is also quite different from the official form of the Maldivian language and has some affinities with ''Mulaku Bas''. In the past, Addu Atoll being a centre of Education, the islanders from the three atolls of the south who acquired education from the atoll used the ''Addu Bas'' as their lingua franca. Hence, when for example one of these islanders of any of the Huvadhu islands met with someone from Fuvahmulah, they would use ''Addu Bas'' to talk to each other. ''Addu Bas'' is the most widespread of the dialects of Maldivian. However, the secessionist government of the [[United Suvadive Republic|Suvadives]] (1959–1963) used ''Malé Bas'' in its official correspondence.

The lesser known dialect in the Madifushi island of [[Kolhumadulu Atoll|Kolhumadulu]] locally known as ''Madifushi Bas'' has some similarities with ''Huvadhu Bas''. Word-final 'a' is often replaced with 'e' or 'o', and some final consonants also differ.

The letter [[Ṇaviyani]] {{lang|dv|ޱ}} (different from the letter Ñaviyani), which represented the retroflex ''n'' sound common to many Indic languages ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], etc.), was abolished from official documents in 1950 by Muhammad Amin, the ruler of Maldives. It is not known why this particular letter representing a retroflex sound was abolished while others, like Ḷaviyani, Ḍaviyani, and Ṭaviyani, were not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders: A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom''&lt;/ref&gt; Ṇaviyani's former position in the Thaana alphabet, between the letters Gaafu and Seenu, is today occupied by the palatal nasal Ñ or Ñyaviyani ޏ. It is still seen in reprints of traditional old books like the ''Bodu Tarutheebu'' and official documents like ''Rādavaḷi''. It is also used by people of southern atolls when writing songs or poetry in their language variant.

According to Sonja Fritz, "the dialects of Maldivian represent different diachronial stages in the development of the language. Especially in the field of morphology, the amount of archaic features steadily increase from the north to the south. Within the three southernmost atolls (of the Maldives), the dialect of the Addu islands which form the southern tip of the whole archipelago is characterized by the highest degree of archaicity".&lt;ref name= Fritz&gt;Fritz (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fritz puts forward this theory based on research into the dialects of Addu and Fuvahmulah. She is yet to do research on the dialect of Huvadhu Atoll, and has to do more research on both Addu and Fuvahmulah dialect.{{who|date=July 2016}}{{when|date=July 2016}} Only then can she determine whether the dialects Fuvahmulah and Huvadhu or that of Addu is more archaic. However, from Malé (Maldives) to the south up to Huvadhu Atoll (Maldives) the amount of archaic features increase but from Huvadhu Atoll the amount of archaic features decrease towards south. And the dialect of Huvadhu is characterized by the highest degree of archaicity.

Fritz also adds that "the different classes of verb conjugation and nominal inflection are best preserved there, morphological simplifications and, as a consequence increasing from atoll to atoll towards north (in the Maldives)".

== Spoken and literary varieties ==
Maldivian presents another aspect with which English speakers are not too familiar: the distinction between what is spoken and what is written. Every language that has a written idiom has this distinction to a greater or lesser degree. But Asian languages such as Maldivian seem to exhibit major differences between the two varieties of language. Malé Bas and Maliku Bas are the only dialects commonly used in writing.

Spoken Maldivian, for instance, has twenty seven consonants. In contrast, written or literary Maldivian contains these sounds and some Arabic sounds as well. Though these sounds are also used in speaking, their phonetics are not strictly observed. This results in pronouncing it as close as possible to the Maldivian sounds when speaking.

To make things simpler it may be said that every sentence in written Maldivian ends with the addition of ‘ve’, which is never used to end a sentence in spoken Maldivian. In using ‘ve’ a strict word-order also has to be maintained. But in spoken Maldivian word-order is not considered to be very rigid.

{{anchor|sukun}}One of the very important things one has to take into account in written Maldivian which is not so important in spoken Maldivian is the ‘[[sukun]]’ on the letters ‘alif’ and ‘shaviyani’. ‘Sukun’ in general is a mark to indicate an abrupt stop on the sound of the letter on which it is placed. However, if it comes within the word, the letter is repeated; if it comes on a ‘shaviyani’ or ‘alif’ at the end of a word, it signifies the sound ‘h’; if it comes on a ‘thaa’, the sound is replaced by ‘iy’.

== Writing system ==
{{main|Maldivian writing systems|Thaana}}

The Maldivian language has had its own script since very ancient times, most likely over two millennia, when Maldivian Buddhist monks translated and copied the Buddhist scriptures.

It used to be written in the earlier form (Evēla) of the [[Dhives Akuru]] ("Dhivehi/Maldivian letters") which are written from left to right. Dhives Akuru were used in all of the islands between the conversion to Islam and until the 18th century. These ancient Maldivian letters were also used in official correspondence with Addu Atoll until the early 20th century. Perhaps they were used in some isolated islands and rural communities until the 1960s, but the last remaining native user died in the 1990s. Today Maldivians rarely learn the Dhives Akuru alphabet, for Arabic is being favoured as second script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4643911/Divehi_Akuru_1_|title=The Maldivian Script. Volume One. (Divehi Akuru - 1)|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maldivian is now written using a different script, called Taana or Thaana, written from right to left. This script is relatively recent.

The literacy rate of the Maldives is very high (98%) compared to other South Asian countries. Since the 1960s English has become the medium of education in most schools although they still have Maldivian language classes, but Maldivian is still the language used for the overall administration.

Maldivian uses mainly the Thaana script for writing. It is an [[alphabet]], with obligatory vowels derived from the vowel diacritics of the [[Arabic script|Arabic abjad]].  It is a largely [[phoneme|phonemic]] script: With a few minor exceptions, spelling can be predicted from pronunciation, and pronunciation from spelling.

The origins of Thaana are unique among the world's alphabets: The first nine letters (h&amp;ndash;v) are derived from the Arabic numerals, whereas the next nine (m&amp;ndash;d) were the local Indic numerals. (See [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system|Hindu-Arabic numerals]].) The remaining letters for loanwords (t&amp;ndash;z) and Arabic transliteration are derived from phonetically similar native consonants by means of diacritics, with the exception of y, which is of unknown origin. This means that Thaana is one of the few alphabets not derived graphically from the [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|original Semitic alphabet]] – unless the Indic numerals were (see [[Brahmi numeral]]s). The Thaana alphabet (hā, shaviyani, nūnu, rā, bā, ...) does not follow the ancient order of the other Indic scripts (like Sinhala or Tamil) or the order of the Arabic alphabet.

Thaana, like Hebrew and Arabic, is written [[right to left]].  It indicates vowels with diacritic marks derived from Arabic. Each letter must carry either a vowel or a ''[[sukun]]'', which indicates "no vowel". The only exception to this rule is ''noonu'' which, when written without a diacritic, indicates [[prenasalized stop|prenasalisation]] of a following [[plosive consonant|stop]].

The [[vowel]]s are written with diacritical signs called ''fili''. There are five ''fili'' for short vowels (a, i, u, e, o), where the first three look identical to the [[harakat|Arabic vowel signs]] (''fatha'', ''kasra'' and ''damma''). Long vowels (aa, ee, oo, ey, oa) are denoted by doubled ''fili'' (except oa, which is a modification of the short ''obofili'').

The letter ''alifu'' has no sound value of its own and is used for three different purposes:
It can act as a carrier for a vowel with no preceding consonant, that is, a word-initial vowel or the second part of a [[diphthong]]; when it carries a ''sukun'', it indicates [[gemination]] (lengthening) of the following consonant; and if ''alifu''+''sukun'' occurs at the end of a word, it indicates that the word ends in /eh/. Gemination of nasals, however, is indicated by ''noonu''+sukun preceding the nasal to be geminated.

Maldivian is also written in [[Romanization of Mahal|Roman script]] and [[Devanāgarī]] script.

==Latin transliteration==
{{main|Malé Latin}}

Towards the mid-1970s, during President [[Ibrahim Nasir]]'s tenure, the Maldivian government introduced [[Telegraphy|telex]] machines in the local administration. This was viewed as great progress, but the local Thaana script was deemed to be an obstacle because messages on the [[Teleprinter|telex machines]] could only be written in the [[Latin script]].

Following this, in 1976 the government approved a new official Latin transliteration, [[Malé Latin|Dhivehi Latin]], which was quickly implemented by the administration. Booklets were printed and dispatched to all Atoll and Island Offices, as well as schools and merchant liners. This was seen by many as the effective demise of the Thaana script.
Clarence Maloney, an American anthropologist who was in the Maldives at the time of the change, lamented the inconsistencies of the "Dhivehi Latin" which ignored all previous linguistic research on the Maldivian language done by H.C.P. Bell and Wilhelm Geiger. He wondered why the modern [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|Standard Indic transliteration]] had not been considered. Standard Indic is a consistent script system that is well adapted to writing practically all languages of South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Clarence Maloney. ''People of the Maldive Islands''&lt;/ref&gt;

The government reinstated the Thaana script shortly after President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Maumoon]] took power in 1978. There was widespread relief in certain places, especially rural areas, where the introduction of Latin had been regarded with suspicion. However, the substandard Latin transcription of 1976 continues to be widely used.

== Dictionary ==
The 412-page hard-back English-Maldivian dictionary, ''A Maldivian Dictionary'', written by [[Christopher Hanby Baillie Reynolds]], was published on 22 July 2003 by [[Routledge]] and contains about 5000 individual entries.

== Phonology ==
{{main|Maldivian phonology}}
The sound system of Maldivian is similar to that of [[south India]]n languages. Like other modern Indo-Aryan languages the Maldivian phonemic inventory shows an opposition of long and short vowels, of dental and retroflex consonants, and of single and [[geminate]] consonants.

===Intonation===
Maldivian, like English, has intonation, but its patterns are very different from those of English. In Maldivian, the general tendency is to stress the first syllable of a word.

Maldivian has [[geminate consonant]]s. For example, the two 's' sounds in ''vissaara'' (rain) fall into adjoining syllables: ''vis-saa-ra''. Similarly ''feth-thun'' (to swim), ''dhek-kun'' (to show).

===Consonant clusters===

Native Maldivian (''mabbas'') words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s; the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side). Many speakers of Maldivian restrict their phonology to this pattern, even when using loan words, thus ''iskūl'' (VC.CVC) for ''skūl'' (CCVC) "school".

==Grammar==

=== Letters ===
The old sequence of letters used to be:

{{lang|dv|ހ ށ ނ ރ ބ ޅ ކ އ ވ މ ފ ދ ތ ލ ގ ޱ ސ ޑ ޝ ޒ ޓ ޏ ޔ ޕ ޖ ޗ}}

The letters are now ordered:

{{lang|dv|ހ ށ ނ ރ ބ ޅ ކ އ ވ މ ފ ދ ތ ލ ގ ޏ ސ ޑ ޒ ޓ ޔ ޕ ޖ ޗ}}

The letter {{lang|dv|ޱ}} was replaced by {{lang|dv|ޏ}}, and the letter {{lang|dv|ޝ}} was regarded as a letter from the set of ''{{transl|dv|thikijehi-Thaana}}'' (pointed [[Thaana]]) during the rule of [[Mohamed Ameen Didi]].

===Morphology===

====Nouns====

Nouns in Maldivian inflect for [[definiteness]], number and case. Definiteness may be one of ''definite'', ''indefinite'' or ''unspecified''. Number may be ''singular'' or ''plural''. Case may be one of ''[[nominative]]'', ''[[dative]]'', ''[[ablative]]'', ''[[genitive]]'', ''[[locative]]'', ''[[instrumental case|instrumental]]'' or ''[[Nominative case#Emphatic case|emphatic]]''.

=== Nominal morphology ===
The nominal system of Maldivian comprises nouns, pronouns, adjectives and numerals as parts of speech.

=== Numerals ===
Maldivian uses two numeral systems. Both of them are identical up to 30. After 30, however, one system places the unit numeral stem before the decade, for example, ''eh-thirees'' '31' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} "one and thirty") while the other combines the stem of the decade with the unit numeral, for example, ''thirees-ekeh'' '31' ("thirty + one"). The latter system also has numerals multiplied by ten for decades 70, 80 and 90. The decade ''fas dholhas'' '60' ("five twelves"), comes from a much older [[duodecimal]], or dozen-based, system which has nearly disappeared.

=== Verbal morphology ===
The Maldivian verbal system is characterised by a derivational relationship between active, causative and involitive/intransitive verb forms.

===Word order===

The [[word order]] in Maldivian is not as rigid as in English, though changes in the order of words in a sentence may convey subtle differences in meaning. To ask for some fish in a market, one uses the following words: ‘mashah’ (to me) ‘mas’ (fish) ‘vikkaa’ (sell), which may be put in any of the following orders without a change in meaning:

: mashah mas vikkaa.
: mas mashah vikkaa.
: mas vikkaa mashah.

The word ‘mashah’ (to me) may be dropped wherever the context makes it obvious.

===Loan words===
Speakers of Maldivian use a great many loan words from many languages in their everyday conversation (see § [[#Vocabulary|Vocabulary]]). The extent to which loan words  are used varies between speakers, depending on their contacts with that language. Thus, those who have had an English education will tend to use a larger number of English words, while an average speaker with little or no contact with English will tend to use just a few. Some of these adopted words have now become so much part of the Maldivian language that there seem to be no other words that could replace them.

There are different ways by which loan words are naturalised in Maldivian. This depends on whether the loan word refers to a person, a thing, or some kind of action.

====Words referring to persons====
If the loan word refers to a person, the following suffixes can be used: 
* 'u' or no suffix : [[wikt:definite#en-linguistics|definite]] singular
* 'eh' : [[wikt:indefinite#en-linguistics|indefinite]] 
* 'un' : plural

: waiter (veitar) + u = the waiter	 (veitaru)
: waiter (veitar) + eh = a waiter	 (veitareh)
: waiter (veitar) + un = waiters 	(veitarun)

Among some of the most common words of this kind are the following:

actor (ektaru), 
agent (ejentu), 
ambassador (embesedaru), 
architect (aakitektu), 
bodyguard (bodeegaadu),
cashier (keyshiyaru),
director (direktaru, dairektaru), 
doctor (daktaru), 
driver (duraivaru), 
guard (gaadu), 
inspector (inispektaru), 
manager (meneyjaru), 
minister (ministaru), 
operator (opareytaru), 
producer (purodiusaru), 
sergeant (saajentu),
servant (saaventu)

====Words referring to things====

If the loan word refers to a thing, the suffixes are
* 'u’ [[wikt:definite#en-linguistics|definite]] singular
* ‘eh’ [[wikt:indefinite#en-linguistics|indefinite]] singular
*  ‘uthah’ plural

: car (kaar) + u = the car	 (kaaru)
: car (kaar) + eh = a car 	(kaareh)
: car (kaar) + uthah = cars 	(kaaruthah)

Some of the most commonly used words of this kind are the following:

bicycle (baisikalu), 
bill (bilu), 
cable (keybalu), 
cake (keyku), 
coat (koatu), 
counter (kauntaru), 
parcel (paarisalu/paarusalu), 
ticket (tiketu)

====Words referring to actions====

If the loan word refers to some kind of action, the Maldivian word 'kure' (present), ‘kuranee’ (present continuous), ‘koffi’ (present perfect), "kuri" (past) or ‘kuraane’ (future) is added after it, if it is done intentionally, and 've' (present),‘vanee’ (present continuous), ‘vejje’ (present perfect), 'vi' (past) and ‘vaane’ (future) is added after it, if it happens to be unintentional or passive. For example, using 'kensal' "cancel":

: kensal + kure = cancel 
: kensal + kuranee = canceling
: kensal + koffi = has been cancelled / cancelled
: kensal + kuri = cancelled
: kensal + kuraane = will cancel

: kensal + vanee = canceling (on its own) i.e. getting cancelled.
: kensal + vejje = cancelled (on its own) i.e. got cancelled
: kensal + vaane = will cancel (on its own) i.e. will get cancelled.

Some examples:

: book (buk) kuranee = booking
: develop (divelop) kuranee = developing
&lt;!-- See Talk page, § "misconstructed example"
: tharaqqee (develop) vanee = developing
--&gt;

==Levels of speech==
Inherent in the Maldivian language is a form of elaborate class distinction expressed through three levels: The first level, the ''enme maaiy goiy'' (known colloquially as ''reethi bas''), is used to address members of the upper class and of royal blood, but is now more often used on national radio and TV. To show respect for elders, officials and strangers the second level, ''maaiy goiy'' is used. People use the more informal third level ''aadhaige goiy'' in everyday life and to talk about themselves. Even a nobleman or a high official does not use the high level to talk about himself.

Regarding salutations, there is no direct translation of the English "hello" or "good-bye" in Maldivian. Instead, islanders greet each other with a smile or the raising of the eyebrow and just ask "where are you going?", followed by "what for?". Goodbyes were not traditionally expressed, except in highly formal speech or in poetry

== Vocabulary ==
Maldivian contains many [[loan word]]s from other languages.

=== Word origins ===
After the arrival of [[Islam in South Asia]], Persian and Arabic made a significant impact on Maldivian. It borrowed extensively from both languages, especially terms related to Islam and the judiciary. Some examples follow:
* ''{{transl|dv|namādu}}'' – "prayer" (from Persian ''{{transl|fa|namāz}}'')
* ''{{transl|dv|rōda}}'' – "fasting" (from Persian ''{{transl|fa|rōzā}}'')
* ''{{transl|dv|kāfaru}}'' – "non-believer" (from Arabic ''{{transl|fa|kāfir}}'')
* ''{{transl|dv|taareekh}}'' – "date" or "history" (from Arabic ''{{transl|ar|tarikh}}'')
* ''{{transl|dv|zaraafaa}}'' – "giraffe" (from Arabic ''{{transl|ar|zarafah}}'')

Portuguese influence in the language can be seen from the period of Portuguese colonial power in the region. Some examples follow:
* ''{{transl|dv|lonsi}}'' – "hunting spear" (from Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|lança}}'')
* ''{{transl|dv|mēzu}}'' – "table" (from Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|mesa}}'')

Maldivian has also borrowed words from [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]] and more recently, English (in particular many scientific and technological terms).

English words are also commonly used in the spoken language, for example "phone", "note", "radio", and ''{{transl|dv|soat}}'' ("shorts").

== Information technology ==

===Typography===
Founded in 1984, the Mahal Unit Press at [[Minicoy]] prints texts in Maldivian, among other languages. The press also publishes the ''Lakshadweep Times'' in three languages on a regular basis: Maldivian, English and [[Malayalam]]. This unit is based in the main building, constructed in 1998. For the first time in the history of Lakshadweep, Maldivian was brought into the field of typography.

Activities:
* Production of note books for the department of Education and Jawahar Navodaya School at Minicoy.
* Printing Maldivian textbooks for Standards I to IV.
* Undertaking printing work from the public on a payment basis.

===Fonts===
Freely downloadable [[open-source Unicode typefaces]] featuring Thaana letters include [[FreeSerif]] and MPH 2B Damase.

===Text editors===
Fthaana, Universal Word, Accent Express, Accent Special Edition are the most common word processors used. However now most of the people use [[MS Word]] to write Maldivian.

[[File:Nostratic tree.svg|thumb|330px|A phylogenetic representation of Nostratic proposed by [[Allan R. Bomhard|Allan Bomhard]] in 2008.]]
'''Nostratic'''&lt;ref&gt;http://starling.rinet.ru/Texts/dlgsynth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[macrofamily]], or hypothetical large-scale [[language family]], which includes many of the indigenous language families of [[Eurasia]], although its exact composition and structure vary among proponents. It typically comprises [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]], [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], and [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] languages; some languages from the disputed [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] family; the [[Afroasiatic languages]] spoken in [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the [[Near East]]; and the [[Dravidian languages]] of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] (sometimes also [[Elamo-Dravidian languages|Elamo-Dravidian]], which connects [[India]] and the [[Iranian Plateau]]).

The hypothetical ancestral language of the Nostratic family is called '''Proto-Nostratic'''.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Bomhard 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Proto-Nostratic would have been spoken between 15,000 and 12,000&amp;nbsp;BCE, in the [[Epipaleolithic]] period, close to the end of the [[last glacial period]].&lt;ref&gt;(Bomhard 2008:240).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nostratic hypothesis originates with [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] in the early 20th century. The name "Nostratic" is due to Pedersen (1903), derived from the Latin ''[[:wikt:nostrates|nostrates]]'' "fellow countrymen". The hypothesis was significantly expanded in the 1960s by Soviet linguists, notably [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]], termed the "Moscovite school" by Bomhard (2008, 2011, and 2014), and it has received renewed attention in English-speaking academia since the 1990s.

The hypothesis is controversial and has varying degrees of acceptance amongst linguists worldwide. In [[Russia]], it is endorsed by a minority of linguists, such as [[Vladimir Dybo]], but is not a generally accepted hypothesis. [[Allan R. Bomhard|Allan Bomhard]] is a supporter, [[Lyle Campbell]] a critic. Some linguists take an agnostic view.&lt;ref&gt;For instance Philip Baldi: "No particular side on the issue is taken in this book" (Baldi 2002:18).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], a similar grouping, was proposed by [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000) and endorsed by [[Merritt Ruhlen]]: it is taken as a subfamily of Nostratic by Bomhard (2008).

==History of research==

===Origin of the Nostratic hypothesis===
The last quarter of the 19th century saw various linguists putting forward proposals linking the [[Indo-European languages]] to other language families, such as [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] and [[Altaic languages|Altaic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Sweet|Sweet]] 1900: vii, 112–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

These proposals were taken much further in 1903 when [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]]  proposed "Nostratic", a common ancestor for the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]], [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyed]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Manchu language|Manchu]], [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]], [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo]], [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], and [[Afroasiatic languages|Hamitic]] languages, with the door left open to the eventual inclusion of others.

The name ''Nostratic'' derives from the [[Latin]] word ''nostrās'', meaning 'our fellow-countryman' (plural: ''nostrates'') and has been defined, since Pedersen, as consisting of those language families that are related to Indo-European.&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen as cited by Ruhlen, 1991: 384.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Merritt Ruhlen]] notes that this definition is not properly taxonomic but amorphous, since there are broader and narrower degrees of relatedness, and moreover, some linguists who broadly accept the concept (such as Greenberg and Ruhlen himself) have criticised the name as reflecting the [[ethnocentrism]] frequent among Europeans at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhlen 1991: 384-5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Bernal]] has described the term as distasteful because it implies that speakers of other language families are excluded from academic discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernal|authorlink=Martin Bernal|title=[[Black Athena]]|chapter=Nostratic and Euroasiatic|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFLm_M_OdK4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA40,M1|year=1987|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn= 0-8135-3655-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the concept arguably transcends ethnocentric associations. (Indeed, Pedersen's older contemporary [[Henry Sweet]] attributed some of the resistance by Indo-European specialists to hypotheses of wider genetic relationships as "prejudice against dethroning [Indo-European] from its proud isolation and affiliating it to the languages of yellow races".)&lt;ref&gt;Sweet (1900), ''The History of Language'', cit in Ruhlen 1991: 381-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed alternative names such as ''Mitian'', formed from the characteristic Nostratic first- and second-person pronouns ''mi'' 'I' and ''ti'' 'you' (exactly '[[thee]]'),&lt;ref&gt;Ruhlen 1991:259.&lt;/ref&gt; have not attained the same currency.

An early supporter was the French linguist [[Albert Cuny]]—better known for his role in the development of the [[laryngeal theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Szemerényi 1996:124.&lt;/ref&gt;—who published his ''Recherches sur le vocalisme, le consonantisme et la formation des racines en « nostratique », ancêtre de l'indo-européen et du chamito-sémitique'' ('Researches on the Vocalism, Consonantism, and Formation of Roots in "Nostratic", Ancestor of Indo-European and Hamito-Semitic') in 1943.  Although Cuny enjoyed a high reputation as a linguist, the work was coldly received.

===Muscovite school===
While Pedersen's Nostratic hypothesis did not make much headway in the West, it became quite popular in what was then the [[Soviet Union]]. Working independently at first, [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]] elaborated the first version of the contemporary form of the hypothesis during the 1960s. They expanded it to include additional language families. Illich-Svitych also prepared the first dictionary of the hypothetical language.

A principal source for the items in Illich-Svitych's dictionary was the earlier work of [[Alfredo Trombetti]] (1866–1929), an Italian linguist who had developed a classification scheme for all the world's languages, widely reviled at the time&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Trombetti’s defense against his critics in ''Come si fa la critica di un libro'' (1907).&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently ignored by almost all linguists. In Trombetti's time, a widely held view on classifying languages was that similarity in inflections is the surest proof of [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]]. In the interim, the view had taken hold that the [[comparative method]]—previously used as a means of studying languages already known to be related and without any thought of classification&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Greenberg 2005:159. See also Saussure's remarks on Franz Bopp, the founder of comparative linguistics, after Saussure has described the discovery of Indo-European by Cœurdoux and William Jones: "Bopp's originality is great. His merit is not to have discovered the kinship of Sanskrit with other European languages, but to have conceived that there was a subject for study in the precise relations of one related language to another related language." (From course notes by R. Engler, quoted by Tullio De Mauro in his critical edition of Ferdinand de Saussure, ''Cours de linguistique générale'', Paris: Payot, 1972, p. 412; cp. ''Cours'' p. 14.)&lt;/ref&gt;—is the most effective means to establish genetic relationship, eventually hardening into the conviction that it is the only legitimate means to do so. This view was basic to the outlook of the new Nostraticists. Although Illich-Svitych adopted many of Trombetti's etymologies, he sought to validate them by a systematic comparison of the sound systems of the languages concerned.

===21st century===
The chief events in Nostratic studies in 2008 were the posting online of the latest version of Dolgopolsky's ''Nostratic Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/196512&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication of Allan Bomhard's comprehensive treatment of the subject, ''Reconstructing Proto-Nostratic'', in 2 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.com/reconstructing-proto-nostratic-2-vols|title=Reconstructing Proto-Nostratic (2 vols) - Brill|website=www.brill.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008 also saw the opening of a website, ''Nostratica'', devoted to providing important texts in Nostratic studies online, which is now offline.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nostratic.net/index.php?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; Also significant was Bomhard's partly critical review of Dolgopolsky's dictionary, in which he argued that only those Nostratic etymologies that are strongest should be included, in contrast to Dolgopolsky's more expansive approach, which includes many etymologies that are possible but not secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/BomhardACriticalReviewOfDolgopolskysNostraticDictionary |title=Bomhard - A Critical Review of Dolgopolsky's Nostratic Dictionary |first=Allan R. |last=Bomhard |publisher= |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, Allan Bomhard published his latest monograph on Nostratic, ''A Comprehensive Introduction to Nostratic Comparative Linguistics''.&lt;ref name=Bomhard_2016&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/BomhardAComprehensiveIntroductionToNostraticComparativeLinguistics |title=A Comprehensive Inroduction to Nostratic Comparative Linguistics (2nd edition) |first=Allan R. |last=Bomhard |date=15 February 2016 |publisher= |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constituent language families==
The language families proposed for inclusion in Nostratic vary, but all Nostraticists agree on a common core of language families, with differences of opinion appearing over the inclusion of additional families.

The three groups universally accepted among Nostraticists are Indo-European, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], and Altaic; the validity of the Altaic family, while itself controversial, is taken for granted by Nostraticists. Nearly all also include the [[South Caucasian languages|Kartvelian]] and [[Dravidian language|Dravidian]] language families.{{Citation needed|date = December 2014}}

Following Pedersen, Illich-Svitych, and Dolgopolsky, most advocates of the theory have included [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]], though criticisms by [[Joseph Greenberg]] and others from the late 1980s onward suggested a reassessment of this position.

A fairly representative grouping, arranged in rough geographical order (and probable order of [[phylogenetic]] branching, following Starostin),&lt;ref&gt;http://starling.rinet.ru/images/globet.png&lt;/ref&gt; would include:

*[[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]
*[[South Caucasian languages|Kartvelian]]
*[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]
*[[Uralic languages|Uralic]]
*[[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]]
*[[Altaic languages|Altaic]], or separately:
**[[Koreanic languages|Koreanic]]
**[[Turkic languages|Turkic]]
**[[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]]
**[[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]]
**[[Japonic languages|Japonic]]
*[[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]]

The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] languages, usually regarded as [[language isolate]]s, are thought by some to be Nostratic languages as well. Others, however, consider one or both to be members of another macrofamily called [[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené–Caucasian]]. Another notional isolate, the [[Elamite language]], also figures in a number of Nostratic classifications. It is frequently grouped with Dravidian as [[Elamo-Dravidian languages|Elamo-Dravidian]].&lt;ref&gt;Salmons Joseph, Nostratic: sifting the evidence (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. F. K. Koerner, Sheila M. Embleton, John Earl Joseph, Hans-Josef Niederehe, The Emergence of the Modern Language Sciences: Methodological perspectives and applications (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Joseph Greenberg proposed a similar macrofamily which he called [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, J., "The Indo-European First and Second Person Pronouns in the Perspective of Eurasiatic, Especially Chukotkan", ''Anthropological Linguistics Vol. 39'', No. 2 (Summer, 1997), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;  It included the same "Euraltaic" core (Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic), but excluded some of the above-listed families, most notably Afroasiatic. At about this time Russian Nostraticists, notably [[Sergei Starostin]], constructed a revised version of Nostratic which was slightly broader than Greenberg's grouping but which similarly left out Afroasiatic.

Beginning in the early 2000s, a consensus emerged among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis. Greenberg basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern 'tier' (his Eurasiatic) and a southern 'tier' (principally Afroasiatic and Dravidian). The American Nostraticist [[Allan R. Bomhard|Allan Bomhard]] considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic alongside other branches: Kartvelian, Afroasiatic, and Elamo-Dravidian. Similarly, [[Georgiy Starostin]] (2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to anything else.&lt;ref&gt;http://starling.rinet.ru/Texts/elam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Sergei Starostin's school has now re-included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic, while reserving the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping which comprises the rest of the macrofamily. Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise placement of Kartvelian and Dravidian.

According to Greenberg, Eurasiatic and [[Amerind languages|Amerind]] form a genetic node, being more closely related to each other than either is to "the other families of the Old World".&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg 2002:2.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of hypotheses incorporating Nostratic into an even broader linguistic 'mega-phylum', sometimes called [[Borean languages|Borean]], which would also include at least the Dené–Caucasian and perhaps the Amerind and [[Austric languages|Austric]] superfamilies. The term SCAN has been used for a group that would include Sino-Caucasian, Amerind, and Nostratic.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven. ''The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language''. William Morrow and Company: New York, 1994. p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urheimat and differentiation==
Allan Bomhard and [[Colin Renfrew, Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn|Colin Renfrew]] are in broad agreement with the earlier conclusions of Illich-Svitych and Dolgopolsky in seeking the Nostratic [[Urheimat]] (original homeland) within the [[Mesolithic]] (or [[Epipaleolithic]]) in the [[Fertile Crescent]], the stage which directly preceded the [[Neolithic]] and was transitional to it.

Looking at the cultural assemblages of this period, two sequences in particular stand out as possible archeological correlates of the earliest Nostratians or their immediate precursors. Both hypotheses place Proto-Nostratic within the [[Fertile Crescent]] at around the end of the [[last glacial period]].
*The first of these is focused on the [[Levant]]. The [[Kebaran]] culture (20,000–17,000 BP)&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Tobias et al. 2011. Interaction before Agriculture: Exchanging Material and Sharing Knowledge in the Final Pleistocene Levant. Cambridge Archaeological Journal 21:1, 95–114. doi:10.1017/S0959774311000060&lt;/ref&gt; not only introduced the [[microlith]]ic assemblage into the region, it also has African affinity specifically with the Ouchtata retouch technique associated with the microlithic [[Halfan culture]] of [[Egypt]] (20,000–17,000 BP)&lt;ref&gt;Fred Wendorf, Romuald Schild and Herbert Haas. A New Radiocarbon Chronology for Prehistoric Sites in Nubia. Journal of Field Archaeology, Vol. 6, No. 2 (Summer, 1979), pp. 219-223&lt;/ref&gt; The Kebarans in their turn were directly ancestral to the succeeding [[Natufian]] culture (10,500–8500 BCE), which has enormous significance for prehistorians as the clearest evidence of hunters and gatherers in actual transition to Neolithic food production. Both cultures extended their influence outside the region into southern [[Anatolia]]. For example, in [[Cilicia]] the [[Belbaşı]] culture (13,000–10,000 BC) shows Kebaran influence, while the Beldibi culture (10,000–8500 BC) shows clear Natufian influence.

*The second possibility as a culture associated with the Nostratic family is the [[Zarzian]] (12,400–8500 BC) culture of the [[Zagros]] mountains, stretching northwards into [[Quhistan|Kohistan]] in the [[Caucasus]] and eastwards into [[Iran]]. In western Iran, the [[M’lefatian|M'lefatian]] culture (10,500–9000 BC) was ancestral to the assemblages of [[Ali Tappah]] (9000–5000 BC) and [[Jeitun]] (6000–4000 BC). Still further east, the [[Hisar, India|Hissar]] culture has been seen as the Mesolithic precursor to the [[Keltiminar]] culture (5500–3500 BC) of the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] steppe.

It has been proposed that the [[broad spectrum revolution]]&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, E., W. Wetterstrom, D. Nadel, and O. Bar-Yosef, "The broad spectrum revisited: Evidence from plant remains" (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2004 101:9551-9555)&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Kent Flannery]] (1969),&lt;ref&gt;F Hole, KV Flannery, JA Neely (1969)"Prehistory and human ecology of the Deh Luran plain: an early village sequence from Khuzistan, Iran", (University of Michigan)&lt;/ref&gt; associated with [[microlith]]s, the use of the [[bow (weapon)|bow and arrow]], and the [[Origin of the domestic dog|domestication of the dog]], all of which are associated with these cultures, might have been the cultural "motor" that led to their expansion. Certainly cultures which appeared at [[Franchthi Cave]] in the Aegean and [[Lepenski Vir]] in the Balkans, and the Murzak-Koba (9100–8000 BC) and [[Grebenki]] (8500–7000 BC) cultures of the Ukrainian steppe, all displayed these adaptations. 

Bomhard (2008) suggests a differentiation of Proto-Nostratic by 8,000 BCE, the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution in the Levant, over a territory spanning the entire Fertile Crescent and beyond into the Caucasus ([[Proto-Kartvelian]]), Egypt and along the Red Sea to the Horn of Africa ([[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afroasiatic]]), the Iranian Plateau (Proto-Elamo-Dravidian) and into Central Asia (Proto-Eurasiatic, to be further subdivided by 5,000 BCE into [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], [[Proto-Uralic]] and [[Proto-Altaic]]).

According to some scholarly opinion the Kebaran is derived from the Levantine Upper Palaeolithic in which the microlithic component originated,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Debitage Analysis of ‘Uyun al-Hammâm The Reconstruction of Epipalaeolithic Reduction Sequences by Danielle Macdonald B.A. Honours, University of Toronto, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; although microlithic cultures were earlier found in Africa.

Ouchtata retouch is also a characteristic of the Late Ahmarian Upper Palaeolithic culture of the Levant and may not indicate African influence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Reconstruction of Proto-Nostratic==
The following data is taken from Kaiser and Shevoroshkin (1988) and Bengtson (1998) and transcribed into the [[help:IPA|IPA]].

===Phonology===
The [[phoneme]]s tabulated below are commonly reconstructed for the Proto-Nostratic language (Kaiser and Shevoroshkin 1988). Allan Bomhard (2008), who relies more heavily on Afroasiatic and Dravidian than on Uralic, as do members of the "Moscow School", reconstructs a different vowel system, with three pairs of vowels represented as: {{IPA|/a/~/ə/, /e/~/i/, /o/~/u/}}, as well as independent /i/, /o/, and /u/. In the first three pairs of vowels, Bomhard is attempting to specify the subphonemic variation involved, inasmuch as that variation led to some of the vowel gradation ([[ablaut]]) and [[vowel harmony]] patterning found in various daughter languages.

====Consonants====
The reconstructed consonants of Nostratic are shown in the table below. Every distinction is supposed to be contrastive by the Nostraticists who reconstruct them.

====Sound correspondences====
The following table is compiled from data given by Kaiser and Shevoroshkin (1988) and Starostin.&lt;ref&gt;http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/bdescr.cgi?root=config&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=\data\nostr\nostret&lt;/ref&gt; They follow Illich-Svitych's correspondences in which Nostratic voiceless stops give (traditional) PIE voiced ones, and Nostratic glottalized stops give (traditional) PIE voiceless stops,&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; in contradiction with the [[Glottalic theory|PIE glottalic theory]], which makes traditional PIE voiced stops appeared like glottalized ones. To correct this anomaly, linguists such as Manaster Ramer&lt;ref&gt;Manaster Ramer(?). ''A "Glottalic" Theory of Nostratic.''&lt;/ref&gt; and Bomhard&lt;ref name=Bomhard_2008&gt;{{cite book |author=Bomhard, A. |year=2008 |title=The Glottalic Theory of Proto-Indo-European and Consonantism and Its Implications for Nostratic Sound Correspondences}}&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed to correlate Nostratic voiceless and glottalized stops with PIE ones, so this is done in the table.

Because linguists working on Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Uralic, and Proto-Dravidian do not usually use the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], the transcriptions used in those fields are also given where the letters differ from the IPA symbols. The IPA symbols are between slashes because this is a [[Phoneme|phonemic]] transcription. The exact values of the phoneme "*p₁" in Proto-Afroasiatic and Proto-Dravidian are unknown. "∅" indicates disappearance without a trace. Hyphens indicate different developments at the beginning and in the interior of words; no consonants ever occurred at the ends of word roots. (Starostin's list of affricate and fricative correspondences does not mention Afroasiatic or Dravidian, and Kaiser and Shevoroshkin don't mention these sounds much; hence the holes in the table.)

Note that, due to lack of research, there are at present several different mutually incompatible reconstructions of Proto-Afroasiatic (see [http://www.tufs.ac.jp/ts/personal/ratcliffe/comp%20&amp;%20method-Ratcliffe.pdf] for two recent reconstructions). The one used here has been said to be based too strongly on [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic]] (Yakubovich 1998&lt;ref&gt;[http://popgen.well.ox.ac.uk/eurasia/htdocs/nostratic.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Similarly, the paper by Kaiser and Shevoroshkin is much older than the newest ''Altaic Etymological Dictionary'' (2003; see [[Altaic languages]] article) and therefore assumes a somewhat different phonological system for Proto-Altaic.
&lt;!-- I have tried to fix this below, but I'm not sure how the different reconstructions correspond to each other.
The reconstruction of voiced and voiceless instead of short and long plosives in Proto-Dravidian follows a mention in G. Starostin (1998) and the usage of the first External Link below. These sources also reconstruct a contrast between dental and alveolar plosives in Proto-Dravidian (in addition to the retroflexes) which I cannot match to anything in Kaiser &amp; Shevoroshkin (1988). Help would be appreciated! --&gt;

===Morphology===

Because grammar is less easily borrowed than words, grammar is usually considered stronger evidence for language relationships than vocabulary. The following correspondences (slightly modified to account for the reconstruction of Proto-Altaic by Starostin et al. [2003]) have been suggested by Kaiser and Shevoroshkin (1988). /N/ could be any nasal consonant. /V/ could be any vowel. (The above cautionary notes on Afroasiatic and Dravidian apply.)

In addition, Kaiser and Shevoroshkin&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser and Shevoroshkin 1988:314f.&lt;/ref&gt; write the following about Proto-Nostratic grammar (two asterisks are used for reconstructions based on reconstructions; citation format changed):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The verb stood at the end of the sentence ([[subject–object–verb|SV and SOV type]]). The 1st p[er]s[on] was formed by adding the 1st ps. pronoun **mi to the verb; similarly, the 2nd ps. was formed by adding **ti. There were no endings for the 3rd ps. present [''or at least none can be reconstructed''], while the 3rd ps. [[preterit]] ending was **-di (Illich-Svitych 1971, pp. 218–19). Verbs could be [[Active voice|active]] and [[Passive voice|passive]], [[causative]], [[desiderative]], and [[reflective]]; and there were special markers for most of these categories. Nouns could be [[Gender (grammar)|animate or inanimate]], and plural markers differed for each category. There were subject and object markers, [[Locative case|locative]] and [[Lative case|lative]] en[[clitic]] particles, etc. Pronouns distinguished direct and oblique forms, animate and inanimate categories, notions of the type 'near':'far', [[Inclusive and exclusive we|inclusive:exclusive]] [...], etc. Apparently there were no prefixes. Nostratic words were either equal to roots or built by adding endings or suffixes. There are some cases of word composition...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Lexicon===

According to [[Aharon Dolgopolsky|Dolgopolsky]] Proto-Nostratic language had [[Isolating language|analytic structure]], which he argues by diverging of post- and prepositions of auxiliary words in descendant languages.
Dolgopolsky states three lexical categories to be in Proto-Nostratic language:
* Lexical words,
* [[Pronoun]]s,
* Auxiliary words.
Word order was [[subject–object–verb]] when the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] was a noun, and [[object–verb–subject]] when it was a [[pronoun]]. Attributive (expressed by a lexical word) preceded its head. Pronominal attributive ('my', 'this') might follow the noun. Auxiliary words are considered to be [[postposition]]s.

====Core vocabulary====
The list of etymologies of lexical words reconstructed by Dolgopolsky that are considered by [[Allan R. Bomhard|Bomhard]] to be well-founded (noted as "strong") includes the following{{clarify|reason=phonetic characters need explanation or link|date=October 2014}}:

====Personal pronouns====
[[Personal pronoun]]s are seldom borrowed between languages. Therefore the many correspondences between Nostratic pronouns are rather strong evidence for the existence of a Proto-Nostratic language. The difficulty of finding Afroasiatic [[cognate]]s is, however, taken by some as evidence that Nostratic has two or three branches, Afroasiatic and Eurasiatic (and possibly Dravidian), and that most or all of the pronouns in the following table can only be traced to Proto-Eurasiatic.

[[Nivkh language|Nivkh]] is a living (if moribund) language with an orthography, which is given here. /V/ means that it is not clear which vowel should be reconstructed.

For space reasons, [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] is not included, but the fact that it had '''/mi/''' 'I' and '''/mini/''' 'me' seems to fit the pattern reconstructed for Proto-Nostratic ideally, leading some&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bomhard 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; to argue that the [[Tyrsenian languages|Aegean or Tyrsenian languages]] were yet another Nostratic branch.

There is no reconstruction of Proto-Eskimo–Aleut, although the existence of the [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] family is generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;See Bomhard 2008:209: "While Proto-Eskimo–Aleut has not yet been reconstructed, great progress has been made in reconstructing Proto-Eskimo."&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on comparisons to other Nostratic languages, however, some linguists (e.g. Ruhlen 1998) interpret 'I' as a compound of a Proto-Nostratic demonstrative pronoun {{IPA|/ʔe/ ~ /ʔi/}}, a Proto-Nostratic (or Proto-Eurasiatic) verb /gæ/ ~ /ge/ ~ /gi/ that probably meant 'to be', and -/m/&amp;nbsp;– in short, 'that's me' (''that'' demonstrative pronoun, ''is'' verb, and a derivative of Proto-Nostratic /minV/) or "c'est moi" (''ce'' demonstrative pronoun, ''est'' verb, and another derivative of Proto-Nostratic /minV/). As support, Ruhlen (1998) cites Chukchi {{IPA|-/eɣəm/}} and {{IPA|/ɣem/}} 'I' and {{IPA|-/eɣət/}} and {{IPA|/ɣet/}} 'thou', [[Itelmen language|Itelmen]] ким /kim/ 'I' and ма /ma/ 'me', the Proto-Eskimo suffix -/m'''kə'''t/ (see table), and several Uralic occurrences like [[Kamassian language|Kamassian]] /igæm/ 'I am' or Hungarian ''engemet'' {{IPA|/ɛmɡɛmɛt/}} 'me', ''tégedet'' {{IPA|/teːɡɛdɛt/}} 'thee' (where ''-et'' is the accusative ending).

====Other words====
Below are selected reconstructed etymologies from Kaiser and Shevoroshkin (1988) and Bengtson (1998). Reconstructed ( = unattested) forms are marked with an asterisk. /V/ means that it is not clear which vowel should be reconstructed. Likewise, /E/ could have been any front vowel and /N/ any nasal consonant. Only the consonants are given of Proto-Afroasiatic roots (see above).

*Proto-Nostratic '''{{IPA|*/kʼo/}} or {{IPA|*/qʼo/}}''' 'who'
**Proto-Indo-European {{IPA|*kʷo- /kʷo/-}} 'who', {{IPA|kʷi- /kʷi/-}} (with suffix -i-) 'what'. Ancestors of the English ''wh-'' words.
**Proto-Afroasiatic {{IPA|*/kʼ(w)/}} and {{IPA|/k(w)/}} 'who'. The change from ejective to plain consonants in Proto-Afroasiatic is apparently regular in grammatical words (Kaiser and Shevoroshkin 1988; see also {{IPA|*/tV/}} instead of {{IPA|*/tʼV/}} above).
**Proto-Altaic ?{{IPA|*/kʰa/-}}. The presence of /a/ instead of /o/ is unexplained, but Kaiser and Shevoroshkin (1988) regard this alternation as common among Nostratic languages.
**Proto-Uralic {{IPA|*ko- ~ ku- /ko/- ~ /ku/-}} 'who'
**"Yukaghir" ([[Northern Yukaghir language|Northern]], Southern, or both?) кин {{IPA|/kin/}} 'who'
**Proto-Chukotko-Kamchatkan {{IPA|*/mki/}}, {{IPA|*/mkin/-}} 'who'
**Proto-Eskimo–Aleut {{IPA|*/ken/}} 'who'
*Proto-Nostratic '''{{IPA|*/kʼærd/}}, {{IPA|*/kʼerd/}}, or {{IPA|*/kʼird/}}''' 'heart ~ chest' (Kaiser and Shevoroshkin [1988]; the Proto-Eskimo form given by Bengtson [1998] may indicate that the vowel was {{IPA|/æ/}} ''or not'').
**Proto-Indo-European {{IPA|*ḱerd- /kʲerd/-}} 'heart'. The occurrence of {{IPA|*d}} instead of {{IPA|*dʰ}} is regular: voiceless and aspirated consonants never occur together in the same Proto-Indo-European root.
**Afroasiatic: Proto-Chadic {{IPA|*/kʼVrd/-}} 'chest'
**Proto-Kartvelian {{IPA|*/mkʼerd-/}} (/m/ being a prefix) 'chest ~ breast'
**Proto-Eskimo {{IPA|*/qatə/}} 'heart ~ breast'. The presence of /q/ instead of /k/ is not clear.
*Proto-Nostratic '''{{IPA|*/qʼiwlV/}}''' 'ear ~ hear'
**Proto-Indo-European {{IPA|*ḱleu̯- /kʲleu̯/-}} 'hear'. Ancestor of English ''listen'', ''loud''.
**Proto-Afroasiatic {{IPA|*/kʼ(w)l/}} 'hear'
**Proto-Kartvelian {{IPA|*/qʼur/}} 'ear'
**Proto-Altaic {{IPA|*/kʰul/-}} 'ear'
**Proto-Uralic {{IPA|*kūle- /kuːle/-}} (long vowel from fusion of {{IPA|-/iw/-}}) 'hear'
**Proto-Dravidian {{IPA|*kēḷ /keːɭ/}} 'hear'. (Must figure out if it's /g/- instead.)
**Proto-Chukotko-Kamchatkan {{IPA|*/vilvV/}}, possibly from earlier {{IPA|/kʷilwV/}} 'ear'
*Proto-Nostratic '''{{IPA|*/kiwæ/ ~ /kiwe/ ~ /kiwi/}}''' 'stone'
**Afroasiatic: Proto-Chadic {{IPA|*/kw/-}} 'stone'
**Proto-Kartvelian {{IPA|*/kwa/-}} 'stone'
**Proto-Uralic {{IPA|*kiwe- /kiwe/-}} 'stone'
**Proto-Dravidian {{IPA|*/kwa/}} 'stone'
**Proto-Chukotko-Kamchatkan {{IPA|*/xəvxə/}} 'stone'; [[Itelmen language|Kamchadal]] квал {{IPA|/kβal/}}, ков {{IPA|/koβ/}} 'stone'
**Proto-Eskimo–Aleut {{IPA|*/kew/-}} 'stone'
*Proto-Nostratic '''{{IPA|*/wete/}}''' 'water'
**Proto-Indo-European {{IPA|*wed- /wed/-}} 'water ~ wet'
**Altaic: Proto-Tungusic {{IPA|*/ødV/}} 'water'
**Proto-Uralic {{IPA|*wete /wete/}} 'water'
**Proto-Dravidian {{IPA|*ōtV- ~ wetV- /oːtV/- ~ /wetV/-}} 'wet'

**Proto-Indo-European {{IPA|*h₂ant- /χant/-}} 'front side'
**Proto-Afroasiatic {{IPA|*/χnt/}} 'front side'; the change from {{IPA|*/ntʼ/}} to {{IPA|*/nt/}} is ''apparently'' regular
**Proto-Altaic {{IPA|*/antV/-}} 'front side'
*Proto-Nostratic '''{{IPA|*/d͡zeɢV/}}''' 'eat'
**Proto-Indo-European {{IPA|*seh₃(w)- /seʁ(w)/-}} 'satiated'
**Proto-Afroasiatic (?) {{IPA|*/zʁ/-}} 'be fed' ~ 'be abundant'

===Sample text===

[[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] using his version of Proto-Nostratic composed a brief poem.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} (Compare [[Schleicher's fable]] for similar attempts with several different reconstructions of Proto-Indo-European.)

==Status within comparative linguistics==

While the Nostratic hypothesis is not endorsed by the mainstream of [[comparative linguistics]], Nostratic studies by nature of being based on the comparative method remain within the mainstream of contemporary linguistics from a methodological point of view; it is the scope with which the comparative method is applied rather than the methodology itself that raises eyebrows{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

Nostraticists tend to refuse to include in their schema language families for which no proto-language has yet been reconstructed. This approach was criticized by [[Joseph Greenberg]] on the ground that genetic classification is necessarily prior to linguistic reconstruction,&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg 2005:337.&lt;/ref&gt; but this criticism has so far had no effect on Nostraticist theory and practice.

Certain critiques have pointed out that the data from individual, established language families that is cited in Nostratic comparisons often involves a high degree of errors; Campbell (1998) demonstrates this for [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] data. Defenders of the Nostratic theory argue that were this to be true, it would remain that in classifying languages genetically, positives count for vastly more than negatives (Ruhlen 1994). The reason for this is that, above a certain threshold, resemblances in sound/meaning correspondences are highly improbable mathematically.

Pedersen's original Nostratic proposal synthesized earlier macrofamilies, some of which, including [[Indo-Uralic languages|Indo-Uralic]], involved extensive comparison of inflections.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Sweet 1900:115–120.&lt;/ref&gt; It is true the Russian Nostraticists and Bomhard initially emphasized lexical comparisons. Bomhard recognized the necessity to explore [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] comparisons and has since published extensive work in this area (see especially Bomhard 2008:1.273–386). According to him the breakthrough came with the publication of the first volume of Joseph Greenberg's Eurasiatic work,&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; which provided a massive list of possible morphemic correspondences that has proved fruitful to explore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/BomhardMoreThoughtsOnNostraticMorphology |title=More Thoughts on Nostratic Morphology |first=Allan R. |last=Bomhard |publisher= |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important contributions on Nostratic morphology have been published by John C. Kerns&lt;ref&gt;In Bomhard and Kerns 1994:141–190.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vladimir Dybo]].&lt;ref&gt;Dybo 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that were one to collect all the words from the various known Indo-European languages and dialects which have at least one of any 4&amp;nbsp;meanings, one could easily form a list that would cover any conceivable combination of two consonants and a vowel (of which there are only about 20×20×5&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2000). Nostraticists respond that they do not compare isolated lexical items but reconstructed proto-languages. To include a word for a proto-language it must be found in a number of languages and the forms must be relatable by regular sound changes. In addition, many languages have restrictions on [[Proto-Indo-European root|root structure]], reducing the number of possible root-forms far below its mathematical maximum. These languages include, among others, Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic—all the core languages of the Nostratic hypothesis. To understand how the root structures of one language relate to those of another has long been a focus of Nostratic studies.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Cuny 1943:113–159 and the various sections on "Root structure patterning" in Bomhard 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  For a highly critical assessment of the work of the Moscow School, especially the work of Illich-Svitych, cf. Campbell and Poser 2008:243-264.

It has also been argued that Nostratic comparisons mistake [[Wanderwort|Wanderwörter]] and cross-borrowings between branches for true cognates.&lt;ref&gt;For example:

From Bomhard and Kerns, ''The Nostratic Macrofamily'', p. 219:
* Proto-Nostratic '''*bar-/*bər-''' 'seed, grain':
** A.  Proto-Indo-European ''*b[h]ars-'' 'grain':   Latin ''far'' 'spelt, grain'; Old Icelandic ''barr'' 'barley'; Old English ''bere'' 'barley'; Old Church Slavonic ''brašъno'' 'food'. Pokorny 1959:111 ''*bhares-'' 'barley'; Walde 1927–1932. II:134 ''*bhares-''; Mann 1984–1987:66 ''*bhars-'' 'wheat, barley'; Watkins 1985:5–6 ''*bhares-'' (''*bhars-'') 'barley'; Gamkrelidze-Ivanov 1984.II: 872–873 ''*b[h]ar(s)-''.
** B.  Proto-Afroasiatic ''*bar-/*bər-'' 'grain, cereal':  Proto-Semitic ''*barr-/*burr'' 'grain, cereal' &gt; Hebrew ''bar'' 'grain'; Arabic ''burr'' 'wheat'; Akkadian ''burru'' 'a cereal'; Sabaean ''brr'' 'wheat'; Harsūsi ''berr'' 'corn, maize, wheat'; Mehri ''ber'' 'corn, maize, wheat'. Cushitic: Somali ''bur'' 'wheat'. (?) Proto-Southern Cushitic ''*bar-/*bal-'' 'grain (generic) &gt; Iraqw ''balaŋ'' 'grain'; Burunge ''baru'' 'grain'; Alagwa ''balu'' 'grain' K'wadza ''balayiko'' 'grain'. Ehret 1980:338.
** C.  Dravidian:   Tamil ''paral'' 'pebble, seed, stone of fruit'; Malayalam ''paral'' 'grit, coarse grain, gravel, cowry shell'; Kota ''parl'' 'pebble, one grain (of any grain)'; Kannaḍa ''paral'', ''paral'' 'pebble, stone' Koḍagu ''para'' 'pebble'; Tuḷu ''parelụ'' 'grain of sand, grit, gravel, grain of corn, etc.; castor seed'; [[Kolami language|Kolami]] ''Parca'' 'gravel'. Burrow-Emeneau 1984:353, no. 3959.
** D. [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''bar'' 'seed'.

Proto-Indo-European ''*b[h]ars-'' seems to be a cultural loanword from Semitic (though several reputable Indo-Europeanists dispute this and consider it to be a native IE word). It should be noted that much of the IE agricultural lexicon is not shared among all branches and seems to have been borrowed, thus supporting the view that the expansion of IE languages was post-Neolithic rather than a Neolithic one as postulated by Renfrew's theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Onnik Chifte-Saraf''' (Armenian Օննիկ Չիֆթե-Սարաֆ) (1874 in  [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Ottoman Empire]] &amp;ndash; July 11, 1932, in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]) was a renowned [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Armenian]] journalist, short story writer, and novelist.&lt;ref name="A reference guide to modern Armenian literature, 1500-1920: with an introductory history"&gt;{{cite book|last=B.

== Life ==
Onnik Chifte-Saraf was born Hovhannes Abisoghomian Aspet in the [[Istanbul]] suburb of [[Üsküdar]].&lt;ref name="Օննիկ Չիֆթե-Սարաֆ" /&gt; He received his education at the Armenian school in [[Kadıköy]], then continued at the [[Getronagan]] Armenian High School, but financial constraints forced him to quit school and work as a clerk to a merchant.&lt;ref name="A reference guide to modern Armenian literature, 1500-1920: with an introductory history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Օննիկ Չիֆթե-Սարաֆ" /&gt; His first articles appeared in the daily Surhantak (Messenger) in 1900. The following year he was invited by [[Arpiar Arpiarian]] (1852-1907) and [[Krikor Zohrab]] (1861-1915) to contribute to the Massis newspaper, where his first short stories were published.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; In 1902-03 he traveled through Italy, Switzerland, France, and England, acquainting himself with the literary trends of the region, and returned home with new impressions. There followed a fertile creative period. He became a regular contributor to a number of periodicals in addition to Massis such as ''Tsaghig'' (Flower), ''Arevelyan Mamul'' (Eastern Press), ''Shirak'', ''Hay Kraganutyun'' (Armenian Literature), ''Byuzantium'', [[Teotig]]'s ''Amenuyn Daretyutsi'' (Everyone's Almanac), and others.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; He also served as an elected member of the Armenian National Assembly. At the start of the [[World War I|First World War]] he was drafted into the Turkish army and thus spared the horrible fate met by most of his writer colleagues during the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt;

In 1919 he founded a weekly paper ''Hay Mitk'' (Armenian Mind), which, though it had only a brief life, reflected at length and in depth upon the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]]. In one article he says: "As the tattered remnants of six hundred years of slavery and suffering, what we lived through these four horrendous years was the sum total of the misery of that entire period. Now our generation, beheaded of its intellectuals, dismembered, stricken at heart, humpbacked and aged, is left like a paralyzed and stunned invalid."&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; In the same year he was teaching in an Armenian orphanage that sheltered hundreds of children retrieved from deportation camps. He was so closely associated with these children that in 1920, when the orphanage moved to the Greek island of [[Corfu]], he moved with them.&lt;ref name="A reference guide to modern Armenian literature, 1500-1920: with an introductory history" /&gt; The literature he produced the following years was strongly influenced by the psychological devastation cause by the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; At this time he signed his works Hovhannes Aspet.

In 1923 he was in [[Marseille]], as principal of the local Armenian National School, and in 1928 in [[Geneva]], as a teacher, where remained for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="A reference guide to modern Armenian literature, 1500-1920: with an introductory history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Օննիկ Չիֆթե-Սարաֆ" /&gt;

== Literary Style ==
[[Literary realism|Realism]] was the dominant trend when he started his literary career, and [[Krikor Zohrab]] was the undisputed master. "His name has a gravitational attraction," he wrote in 1901. "There is charm in the way he writes, the way he thinks, and the way he lives." Zohrab's influence on Chifte-Saraf's earlier stories is particularly strong.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; His own aesthetic principle, however, is that nature and life conceal such a wealth of unequaled beauties in their depths that even the strongest poetic imagination cannot rival them. There are few characters and little action in his short stories, but plenty of love, emotion, and passion. His heroes are compassionate lovers of good, beauty, and harmony, and always of a lyrical disposition. Because he was an admirer of [[Émile Zola]], some critics also claimed to detect a trace of [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] in his realism.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt;

== Works ==
Although Chifte-Saraf wrote a great number of articles, reports, travel notes, meditations, and sketches, he made his fame with short stories, of which some of the best known are ''Jermaknerov'' (Clothed in White), ''Metz Ayon'' (The Big Yes), ''Hokineru Prgutyun'' (Salvation of Souls), ''Pajanumi Kisheri'' (The Night of Separation), ''Speghani'' (Healing Ointment), ''Zeytuntsi Patanin'' (The Youth of [[Süleymanlı|Zeytun]]), and ''Khachelutyun'' (Crucifixion). His best known work is ''Miamiti me Argatsneri'' (The Adventures of a Naive Young Man, 1908), his only novel, which depicts the prodigal life of a youth who inherits considerable wealth from his Scrooge-like uncle.&lt;ref name="A reference guide to modern Armenian literature, 1500-1920: with an introductory history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt;

{{No footnotes|date=April 2011}}
'''Poverty Row''' was a slang term used in [[Hollywood]] from the late 1920s through the mid-1950s to refer to a variety of small (and mostly short-lived) [[B movie]] [[Movie studio|studios]].  While many of them were on (or near) today's [[Gower Street (Hollywood)|Gower Street]] in Hollywood, the term did not necessarily refer to any specific physical location, but was rather a figurative catch-all for low-budget films produced by these lower-tier studios.

== Characteristic films ==
The films of Poverty Row, many of them [[western (genre)|Westerns]] (including series like ''Billy The Kid'', starring [[Buster Crabbe]] from [[Producers Releasing Corporation|PRC]]) or comedy/adventure series such as those featuring the [[The Bowery Boys|Bowery Boys]] ([[Monogram Pictures]]) and detectives such as [[The Shadow]], were generally characterized by low budgets, casts made up of lower ranked stars or unknowns, and overall production values that unintentionally betrayed the haste and economy with which they were made.{{fact|date=June 2013}}

== Studios ==
While some Poverty Row studios came and quickly went after a few releases, others operated on more or less the same terms as—if vastly different scales from—[[major film studio]]s such as [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[Paramount Pictures]].{{fact|date=June 2013}}

The most successful and longest-lived of such lower-tier companies maintained permanent lots (and many standing sets that dedicated moviegoers could frequently recognize from movie to movie), had both cast and crew on long-term contract, and had a more varied output than smaller firms.{{fact|date=June 2013}}

=== Leading studios ===
* [[Columbia Pictures|CBC Productions]] (later to become [[Columbia Pictures]]), founded by [[Harry Cohn]], was considered a Poverty Row studio from 1919 until its reorganization in 1924.
* [[Tiffany Pictures]] was in operation from 1921 through 1932 as both a production company (about 90 films) and a distributor.  
* [[Mascot Pictures]] was formed in 1927 by [[Nat Levine]], and merged into [[Republic Pictures]] in 1935.  
* [[Larry Darmour|Larry Darmour Productions]] flourished from 1927 through the 1930s, mainly on the popularity of its [[Mickey McGuire (film series)|Mickey McGuire]] short film series starring [[Mickey Rooney]].  Damour was also the principal producer within Majestic Pictures until 1935.
* [[Monogram Pictures]] was created in 1931 by the merger of [[Sono Art-World Wide Pictures]] with [[W. Ray Johnston]]'s [[Rayart]].  After the attempted 1935 merger of Monogram into Republic Pictures, Johnston took Monogram independent again, and in the following decades produced everything from college/teen musicals starring popular swing bands to versions of classics like ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' and the final films of [[Kay Francis]].  It evolved, in relatively good financial condition, into [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]] in 1953.  
* [[Republic Pictures]] was organized in 1935 when [[Herbert J. Yates]] combined six other established poverty-row companies, Monogram, [[Mascot Pictures]], [[Liberty Pictures]], [[Majestic Pictures]], [[Chesterfield Pictures]], and [[Invincible Films]] with his [[Consolidated Film Laboratories]].  Republic began by releasing serial shorts and Westerns with [[Gene Autry]] in the 1930s before eventually riding the success of eventual superstar [[John Wayne]] and embarking on more ambitious projects, such as 1952's Wayne hit, ''[[The Quiet Man]]''. 
* [[Grand National Films Inc.]] was organized in 1936 with some significant talent ([[James Cagney]] and director [[Charles Lamont]]), but could not survive without its own distribution channel.  It folded quickly in 1939, having released about 100 films altogether.  
* [[Producers Releasing Corporation]] emerged in 1939 and lasted until 1946, when it was absorbed into [[Eagle-Lion Films]].  PRC presented a steady output of westerns, gangster movies, with occasional high spots, such as [[Edgar G. Ulmer]]'s ''[[Detour (1945 film)|Detour]]'', and their 1944 ''[[Minstrel Man (1944 film)|Minstrel Man]]'', nominated for two [[Academy Awards]].

===Lower-tier studios ===
The smallest studios, including [[Tiffany Pictures]], [[Sam Katzman]]'s Victory, [[Mascot Pictures Corporation|Mascot]] and Chesterfield often packaged and released films from independent producers, British "[[Cinematograph Films Act 1927|quota quickie]]" films, or borderline [[exploitation films]]  such as ''[[Hitler, Beast of Berlin]]'' to supplement their own limited production capacity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Sometimes the same producers would start a new studio when the old one failed, such as [[Harry S. Webb]] and Bernard B. Ray's Reliable Pictures and Metropolitan Pictures.{{fact|date=June 2013}}

Some organizations such as [[Astor Pictures]] and [[Realart Pictures]] began by obtaining the rights to re-release older films from other studios before producing their own films.{{fact|date=June 2013}}

== Decline ==
The breakup of the [[studio system]] (and its restrictive chain-theater distribution network, which left independent movie houses eager for seat-filling product from the Poverty Row studios) following 1948's ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' decision  and the advent of [[television]] are among the factors that led to the decline and ultimate disappearance of "Poverty Row" as a Hollywood phenomenon.

'''Pre-adhesive mail''', also called '''pre-stamp mail''', are [[mail|letters]] carried in mail systems before the issuance of [[postage stamp]]s. A '''stampless cover''' is another description and generally also refers to any item of mail sent before the issuance of [[postage stamp]]s but it can also refer to mail sent, after the introduction of postage stamps, unpaid (as was permitted in many countries) or without the pre-payment being indicated by the affixing of a postage stamp; it could have been pre-paid in cash and marked paid.

This mail is usually a [[letter sheet]] because the use of [[envelope]]s was not popularised until after the introduction of postage stamps. Pre-adhesive mail includes court and government letters and items from the general populace before official public mail services were introduced.  The mail often bears distinctive town and other marks applied worldwide.

In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] pre-adhesive mail was the norm before the [[Penny Black]] and [[Two pence Blue]] stamps were issued for use by the General Post Office on 6 May 1840, and in other countries, to mail used prior to each country's [[postal administration]] adopted adhesive labels to indicate postage had been pre-paid.

In the United States, the majority of stampless mail was sent collect.  This meant that the person receiving the letter paid the postage.  This type of letter was not marked Paid.  Pre-payment of postage was not mandatory in the U.S.A. until 1856.  This greatly impacted small town postmasters as they were compensated based on the amount of postage they collected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12486">In [[logic]], '''Richard's paradox''' is a semantical [[antinomy]] of [[set theory]] and natural language first described by the [[france|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Jules Richard]] in 1905. The paradox is ordinarily used to motivate the importance of distinguishing carefully between [[mathematics]] and [[metamathematics]]. [[Kurt Gödel]] specifically cites Richard's antinomy as a semantical analogue to his syntactical incompleteness result in the introductory section of "[[On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I]]". The paradox was also a motivation of the development of [[impredicativity|predicative]] mathematics.

== Description ==

The original statement of the paradox, due to Richard (1905), is strongly related to [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] on the uncountability of the set of [[real number]]s.

The paradox begins with the observation that certain expressions of natural language define real numbers unambiguously, while other expressions of natural language do not. For example, "The real number the integer part of which is 17 and the ''n''th decimal place of which is 0 if ''n'' is even and 1 if ''n'' is odd" defines the real number 17.1010101... = 1693/99, while the phrase "the capital of England" does not define a real number, also, the phrase "the smallest positive integer not definable in under sixty letters" does not define a real number (see [[Berry's paradox]]).

Thus there is an infinite list of English phrases (such that each phrase is of finite length, but lengths vary in the list) that define real numbers unambiguously. We first arrange this list of phrases by increasing length, then order all phrases of equal length [[Lexicographical order|lexicographically]] (in dictionary order, e.g. we can use the [[ASCII]] code, the phrases can only contain codes 32 to 126), so that the ordering is [[Canonical form|canonical]]. This yields an infinite list of the corresponding real numbers: ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... .  Now define a new real number ''r'' as follows. The integer part of ''r'' is 0, the ''n''th decimal place of ''r'' is 1 if the ''n''th decimal place of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is not 1, and the ''n''th decimal place of ''r'' is 2 if the ''n''th decimal place of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is 1.

The preceding two paragraphs are an expression in English that unambiguously defines a real number ''r''. Thus ''r'' must be one of the numbers ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. However, ''r'' was constructed so that it cannot equal any of the ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (thus, ''r'' is an [[undefinable number]]). This is the paradoxical contradiction.

== Analysis and relationship with metamathematics ==

Richard's paradox results in an untenable contradiction, which must be analyzed to find an error.

The proposed definition of the new real number ''r'' clearly includes a finite sequence of characters, and hence it seems at first to be a definition of a real number. However, the definition refers to definability-in-English itself. If it were possible to determine which English expressions actually ''do'' define a real number, and which do not, then the paradox would go through. Thus the resolution of Richard's paradox is that there is not any way to unambiguously determine exactly which English sentences are definitions of real numbers (see Good&amp;nbsp;1966). That is, there is not any way to describe in a finite number of words how to tell whether an arbitrary English expression is a definition of a real number. This is not surprising, as the ability to make this determination would also imply the ability to solve the [[halting problem]] and perform any other non-algorithmic calculation that can be described in English.

A similar phenomenon occurs in formalized theories that are able to refer to their own syntax, such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC). Say that a formula φ(''x'') ''defines a real number'' if there is exactly one real number ''r'' such that φ(''r'') holds. Then it is not possible to define, by ZFC, the set of all ([[Gödel number]]s of) formulas that define real numbers. For, if it were possible to define this set, it would be possible to diagonalize over it to produce a new definition of a real number, following the outline of Richard's paradox above. Note that the set of formulas that define real numbers may exist, as a set ''F''; the limitation of ZFC is that there is not any formula that defines ''F'' without reference to other sets. This is related to [[Tarski's indefinability theorem]].

The example of ZFC illustrates the importance of distinguishing the [[metamathematics]] of a formal system from the statements of the formal system itself. The property D(φ) that a formula φ of ZFC defines a unique real number is not itself expressible by ZFC, but must be considered as part of the [[metatheory]] used to formalize ZFC. From this viewpoint, Richard's paradox results from treating a construction of the metatheory (the enumeration of all statements in the original system that define real numbers) as if that construction could be performed in the original system.

== Variation: Richardian numbers ==

A variation of the paradox uses integers instead of real-numbers, while preserving the self-referential character of the original. Consider a language (such as English) in which the [[arithmetic|arithmetical properties]] of integers are defined. For example, "the first natural number" defines the property of being the first natural number, one; and "divisible by exactly two natural numbers" defines the property of being a [[prime number]]. (It is clear that some properties cannot be defined explicitly, since every [[deductive system]] must start with some [[axiom]]s. But for the purposes of this argument, it is assumed that phrases such as "an integer is the sum of two integers" are already understood.) While the list of all such possible definitions is itself infinite, it is easily seen that each individual definition is composed of a finite number of words, and therefore also a finite number of characters.  Since this is true, we can order the definitions, first by length and then [[Lexicographical order|lexicographically]].

Now, we may [[map (mathematics)|map]] each definition to the set of [[natural number]]s, such that the definition with the smallest number of characters and alphabetical order will correspond to the number 1, the next definition in the series will correspond to 2, and so on. Since each definition is associated with a unique integer, then it is possible that occasionally the integer assigned to a definition ''fits'' that definition. If, for example, the definition "not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself" happened to be 43rd, then this would be true. Since 43 is itself not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, then the number of this definition has the property of the definition itself. However, this may not always be the case. If the definition: "divisible by 3" were assigned to the number 58, then the number of the definition does ''not'' have the property of the definition itself. Since 58 is itself not divisible by 3. This latter example will be termed as having the property of being ''Richardian''. Thus, if a number is Richardian, then the definition corresponding to that number is a property that the number itself does not have. (More formally, "''x'' is Richardian" is equivalent to "''x'' does ''not'' have the property designated by the defining expression with which ''x'' is correlated in the serially ordered set of definitions".) Thus in this example, 58 is Richardian, but 43 is not. 

Now, since the property of being Richardian is itself a numerical property of integers, it belongs in the list of all definitions of properties. Therefore, the property of being Richardian is assigned some integer, ''n''. For example, if the definition: "being Richardian" were assigned to the number 92. Finally, the paradox becomes: Is 92 Richardian? Suppose 92 is Richardian. This is only possible if 92 does not have the property designated by the defining expression which it is correlated with. In other words, this means 92 is not Richardian, contradicting our assumption. However, if we suppose 92 is not Richardian, then it does have the defining property which it corresponds to. This, by definition, means that it is Richardian, again contrary to assumption. Thus, the statement "92 is Richardian" cannot consistently be designated as either true or false.

== Relation to predicativism ==

Another opinion concerning Richard's paradox relates to mathematical [[predicativism]]. By this view, the real numbers are defined in stages, with each stage only making reference to previous stages and other things that have already been defined. From a predicative viewpoint it is not valid to quantify over ''all'' real numbers in the process of generating a new real number, because this is believed to result in a circularity problem in the definitions. Set theories such as ZFC are not based on this sort of predicative framework, and allow impredicative definitions.

Richard (1905) presented a solution to the paradox from the viewpoint of predicativisim. Richard claimed that the flaw of the paradoxical construction was that the expression for the construction of the real number ''r'' does not actually define a real number unambiguously, because the statement refers to the construction of an infinite set of real numbers, of which ''r'' itself is a part. Thus, Richard says, the real number ''r'' will not be included as any ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, because the definition of ''r'' does not meet the criteria for being included in the sequence of definitions used to construct the sequence ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Contemporary mathematicians agree that the definition of ''r'' is invalid, but for a different reason. They believe the definition of ''r'' is invalid because there is no well-defined notion of when an English phrase defines a real number, and so there is no unambiguous way to construct the sequence ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Although Richard's solution to the paradox did not gain favor with mathematicians, predicativism is an important part of the study of the [[foundations of mathematics]]. Predicativism was first studied in detail by [[Hermann Weyl]] in ''Das Kontinuum'', wherein he showed that much of elementary [[real analysis]] can be conducted in a predicative manner starting with only the [[natural number]]s.  More recently, predicativism has been studied by [[Solomon Feferman]], who has used [[proof theory]] to explore the relationship between predicative and impredicative systems.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Feferman, "[https://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/predicativity.pdf Predicativity]" (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruund''' (Ruwund), also known as '''Northern Lunda''' or ''Uruund'', is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Angola]]. It is highly unusual among [[Bantu languages]] for allowing [[consonant]]al [[coda (linguistics)|coda]]s and for its reduced vowel system, in which short /e/ and /o/ have become [i] and [a] respectively, leaving only 3 short vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~hyman/Bantu_segmental.pdf|title=Segmental Phonology|last=Hyman|first=Larry|page=8|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interesting feature of Ruund is that, as with the related [[Luba-Kasai language|Ciluba]] language, the tones of Proto-Bantu have reversed, so that High has become Low and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, J.A. (1994), [https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/elanguage/sal/article/download/1296/1296-2281-1-PB.pdf "Underlying Low Tones in Ruwund"]. 
''Studies in African Linguistics'' Volume 23, Number 3,1992-1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In this language therefore the accented syllables are Low and the default tone is High.

The left-handed '''Scout handshake''' is a formal way of greeting other Scouts of both genders and is used by members of [[Scouting|Scout and Guide]] organizations around the world. The handshake is made with the hand nearest to the heart and is offered as a token of friendship. In most situations, the handshake is made firmly, without interlocking fingers, and many organizations only use this handshake when both people are in uniform. There are some variations of the handshake between national Scouting organizations and also within some program sections.

The 1935 [[Boy Scout Handbook]] says that "By agreement of the Scout Leaders throughout the world, Boy Scouts greet Brother Scouts with a warm left hand clasp."

All [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] members share the left handshake, and when meeting other Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, it may be used in conjunction with the [[Scout sign]] done with the right hand.

==Meaning of the left-hand==
Various sources have attributed the origin of the handshake, as an ancient sign of bravery and respect, to [[Lord Baden-Powell]]'s encounter after battle with [[Prempeh I]], or to earlier published works by [[Ernest Thompson Seton]]. There exist various versions of the Prempeh story, all centering on African warriors using the left hand to hold their shields and to lower it and shake the left hand of the person was to show they trusted each other.

According to the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] warrior version of the story, then-Colonel Baden-Powell saluted them with his right hand, but the Ashanti chiefs offered their left hands and said, "In our land only the bravest of the brave shake hands with the left hand, because to do so we must drop our shields and our protection." The Ashantis knew of Baden-Powell's bravery because they had fought against him and with him, and they were proud to offer the left hand of bravery.

Another version of the story is that the left-handed handshake was a homage paid to [[Chief Kweku Andoh]] who was left-handed and had the tendency to shake hands with his left.  [[Baden-Powell]] dedicated his account 'The Downfall of Prempeh' to him:  "(Without His Permission). To Chief Andoh of Elmina.  My Guide, Adviser and Friend".  [[Chief Kweku Andoh]] was the officer in the British Army that led the troops to Kumase when they captured [[Prempeh I]] and purportedly taught [[Baden-Powell]] how to scout in the jungle.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The term itself was used as the title of a work by [[Hilary Saint George Saunders]], ''The Left Handshake: The Boy Scout Movement during the War, 1939-1945'', because of the extraordinary courage shown during those times. According to the foreword by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Chief Scout (The Scout Association)|Chief Scout]] [[Thomas Corbett, 2nd Baron Rowallan|Lord Rowallan]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;When Colonel Baden-Powell entered the capital city of the Ashanti people in 1890 he was met by one of the Chiefs who came to him holding out his left hand. B.-P. held out his right in return but the Chief said: "No, in my country the bravest of the brave shake with the left hand." So began the "left handshake" of the world-wide brotherhood of Scouts. In this book are told some of the stories of courage and endurance shown by Scouts in many different countries during the war of 1939-45. There would not be room even in many books to tell them all. Many, indeed, can never be told; some for political reasons, some because the actors died unknown. They remembered their Promise, to do their best to do their duty to God, and their Country; to think of other people and not themselves. So, when the time came, they were prepared in body and in spirit to render their service. Their record is unsurpassed; they were "the bravest of the brave."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The left hand is also closer to the heart, with that attendant symbolism.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The '''serpentine system''' is a method employed in the organization of a [[competition]] to define the [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeded]] teams and arrange them in pools. The ''n'' ranked teams that will be involved in the [[tournament]] are distributed in ''m'' pools according to the following [[algorithm]]:

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="{ font-size:smaller; }"
|- bgcolor="#efefef" 
!Pool 1!!Pool 2!! . . . !!Pool ''m'' − 1!!Pool ''m''
|- align="center"
|1||2|| . . . ||''m'' − 1||''m''
|- align="center"
|2''m''||2''m'' − 1|| . . . ||''m'' + 2||''m'' + 1
|- align="center"
|2''m'' + 1||2''m'' + 2|| . . . ||3''m'' − 1||3''m''
|- align="center"
|...||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;
|}

For instance, 12 teams would be organized in four-team pools, according to the serpentine   system, as follows:

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="font-size:smaller"
|- bgcolor="#efefef"
!Pool 1!!Pool 2!!Pool 3
|- align="center"
|1||2||3
|- align="center"
|6||5||4
|- align="center"
|7||8||9
|- align="center"
|12||11||10
|}

To improve competitivity, this method is sometimes used in conjunction with the [[Drawing straws|drawing of lots]] method: the serpentine system is used only for some of the teams involved in a competition ("seeds"); the rest is distributed in pools following a drawing of lots.

==Controversy==
In 28 April 2004, Sreebala approached the State Women's Commission (SWC) against the residents' association office-bearers of her flat complex, alleging that they have been intruding into her personal life to the point of harassment. The complaint was filed jointly by the owner of the flat, [[Dr J. Devika]], a researcher at the Centre for Development Studies and Ms. Menon to whom she had let out the flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=staff|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/04/29/stories/2004042913180300.htm|title= Woman complaints against residents' association office-bearers|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since she was single woman, visitors to her flat were asked to jot down their names in a book, which she considered to be a breach of her privacy.

This incident sparked off a debate on the right to privacy of the tenant and the problems faced by working women when they search for accommodation. V. Shantaram, Director, State Women's Commission, said on the issue that  "We shall initiate appropriate action. The Constitution also provides special protection to women and any sort of physical or verbal harassment can be brought to the notice of the police officials. No woman should tolerate such unfair treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=staff|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/06/28/stories/2004062801510100.htm|title=Single and OUT!|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Study of the [[Hebrew language]]''' has an ancient history. Since Hebrew is the original [[language]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (known as the [[Torah]] and [[Tanakh]]), it is therefore a language that has always been central to [[Judaism]] and valued by the [[Jew]]ish people for over three thousand years and later by [[Christian]] scholars as well.

==Jewish scholars of Hebrew==

The beginnings of the study of Hebrew are found in the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]], which have some [[grammar|grammatical]] notes. The [[Masoretes]] continued the study as they fixed the text and vocalization of the Hebrew Bible. Under the influence of the Arab grammarians, Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]] (tenth century) made the Jewish study of Hebrew grammar almost scientific. Later Jewish grammarians include [[David Kimhi|David Qimhi]] (known as the Radak), [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], and [[Judah ben David Hayyuj]].

[[Eliezer Ben Yehuda]] is credited by many as being almost single-handedly responsible for the Zionist movement's revitalization of Hebrew as a modern spoken language, although in his book "Language in Time of Revolution" the Israeli linguist and literature researcher Benjamin Harshav diminishes Ben-Yehuda's role and attributes the success of the revival to a wider movement in the Jewish society.

==Non-Jewish scholars of Hebrew==

The first major non-Jewish grammarian was [[John Reuchlin]] (16th century), but it was not until the early 19th century that Hebrew [[linguistics]] was studied on a secular, scientific level. The pioneer of this movement was [[Wilhelm Gesenius]], who published thirteen editions of his ''Hebräische Grammatik''. After Gesenius' death in 1842, the 14th through 21st editions were published by [[E. Rödiger]], and the 22nd through 28th editions were published by [[Emil Kautzsch]]. Many of these editions were translated into English; the 28th edition was done in 1910 by [[A. E. Cowley]] and is known today simply as ''[[:s:Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar|Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar]]''. It became the standard Hebrew reference grammar and although it is somewhat outdated by newer works, it is still widely used in the field in the 21st century.

The largest compendium of Hebrew grammatical material is [[Friedrich_Eduard_König | König]]'s ''Historisch-Kritisches Lehrgebäude der Hebräischen Sprache'' (1881-97).

[[Paul Joüon]]'s ''Grammaire de l'hébreu biblique'' (1923) was recently edited and translated into English by [[Takamitsu Muraoka | Muraoka]] as ''A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew'' (1991; revised edition 2006). Muraoka made this into the most complete and up-to-date reference grammar. Also quite modern is [[Rudolf Meyer]]'s ''Hebräische Grammatik'' (1966-72), but it is not quite as thorough as Joüon-Muraoka. Of note as well is [[Mayer Lambert]]'s ''Traité de grammaire hébraïque'' (1931).

The most thorough, well-organized, and analytically incisive Hebrew grammar is the 29th edition of Gesenius' grammar by [[Gotthelf Bergsträsser]]. However, the author only managed to complete the sections on Phonology (1918) and the Verb (1929) before his untimely death. Although other grammars are more current, Bergsträsser's is unsurpassed due to its depth and insight. Another excellent grammar is Hans Bauer and Pontus Leander's ''Historische Grammatik der Hebräischen Sprache des Alten Testaments'' (1917-22) although it, too, lacks syntax. Neither grammar has been translated into English, although Bergsträsser's has been translated into Hebrew (Jerusalem, 1972).

==Israeli Hebrew scholars==

One must note the contributions, in recent years, of [[Israel]]i scholars to the field of Hebrew linguistics, most notably [[Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai]], [[Chaim Menachem Rabin]], [[E. Y. Kutscher]], [[Shelomo Morag]], [[Joshua Blau]], [[Ze'ev Ben-Hayyim]], [[Elisha Qimron]] and [[Moshe Bar-Asher]].

==The Academy of the Hebrew Language== 

The [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]
(האקדמיה ללשון העברית) in modern [[Israel]] is the "Supreme Foundation for the Science of the Hebrew Language" founded by the Israeli Government in 1953. This academy is responsible for creating new Hebrew words to keep up with today's rapidly changing society. In addition, the academy has the "final say" concerning matters of spelling and grammar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12824">'''Teaching writing in the United States''' has progressed through several approaches during the history of education in the United States.

== Background ==

At its most basic level, writing is how people keep track of the thoughts that are important to them. From the ancient [[Egyptians]], to the monks of the Middle Ages, to [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], writing has been used to capture thought, from the mundane to the profound.&lt;ref&gt;The Vermont Writing Collaborative: ''Writing for Understanding'', pp 4–5.  Authentic Education, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In schools, writing serves not only to record and convey thoughts, but to refine and synthesize thinking. As school effectiveness researcher Doug Reeves discovered, "The association between writing and performance in other academic disciplines [is] striking, and gets to the heart of the curriculum choices teachers must make."&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Douglas:  ''Accountability in Action—A Blueprint for Learning'', pp. 189–90.  Advanced Learning Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early writing instruction ==

Early academic instruction in writing centered almost exclusively on mechanics, commonly referred to today as [[Convention (norm)|conventions]]. Emphasis was placed on handwriting, grammar, punctuation and spelling. Papers were more likely to be graded on conformity to these conventions and accuracy of content than on style or creative expression of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;"Literacy: Writing and Composition." Encyclopedia of Education. The Gale Group, Inc, 2002. Answers.com 30 Jan. 2010. [http://www.answers.com/topic/literacy-writing-and-composition]&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, instruction in writing has focused on a narrow pool of concrete, easily definable skills.

== Writing process approach ==

Research conducted in the late 1970s by [[Donald Graves]], Janet Emig and others led to a focus on the process, rather than solely the product, of writing.&lt;ref&gt;National Writing Project and Carl Nagin: ''Because Writing Matters'', p. 22, Jossey-Bass,2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[writing process]] approach rests on the premise that writing is a complex and individualized task which can be described through a series of [[Recursion|recursive]] stages.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, D: ''Write to Learn'', pp. 5–6, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; These stages, commonly including pre-writing, writing, editing and revision, and the concepts of craft within them, can be modeled and taught to students. This allows the teacher to identify the difficulties students are having with writing and to provide appropriate instruction and support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Institute for Writing and Rhetoric|url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~writing/materials/tutor/pedagogy/process.html|website = www.dartmouth.edu|access-date = 2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The writing process approach helps students to understand what writers actually do when they write, providing multiple models and individual feedback on writing pieces in progress. Students are encouraged to choose their own topics and purposes for writing, and to write to real audiences. This approach has been widely adopted in schools throughout the United States.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

A new way to have students write is to work together – known as collaborative writing. There are many criticisms against collaborative writing and many people are uncomfortable with it. Darolyn Jones, author of ''Collaborative Writing: Priority, Practice and Process'', says that many people work alone for several reasons. The first one is that many people cannot find time to meet with the rest of the group. Another reason is that each writer has their organization and own process of writing. When students are forced to work with others, they must adjust to the style of the group and get rid of their own. Many times there is a misunderstanding of what is expected of the students. The last reason, and the biggest one, is the fear of being criticized. Many writers do not feel comfortable sharing their work because they are afraid it will be torn down and disliked by readers and their audience.

Despite these issues, there are several benefits to collaborative writing. Collaboration results in a stronger finished product.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Each member can contribute their own strengths for the assignment. Working together allows students to mentor each other and practice working with one another, which will help them in the real world when they go out for their job. While the project may seem daunting, working together allows the burden to be shared and there are more eyes for editing the final project.

== Writing across the curriculum ==

During the 1980s and 1990s, new approaches to teaching writing emerged, as teachers realized that in order to be effective, a piece of writing should be tailored to a specific purpose and audience. Prominent among these was the British-based movement which came to be known as [[Writing Across the Curriculum]]. This approach rests on the premise that all teachers, not just [[language arts]] teachers, must be teachers of writing.  Designed to ease the separation between [[literacy]] and content knowledge, this approach emphasizes the connection between writing and cognitive development, teaching students to write in a variety of genres, specific to purpose and discipline. Writing Across the Curriculum teachers often emphasize two basic pedagogical strands:  Writing to Learn, informal writing done to prompt students to more deeply understand concepts; and Writing in the Disciplines, in which students are taught writing skills and conventions necessary to participate in specific academic discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Bazerman, Joseph Little, Lisa Bethel, Teri Chavkin, Danielle Fouquette, and Janet Garufis: ''Reference Guide to Writing Across the Curriculum''. Parlor Press and the WAC Clearinghouse,2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing for understanding ==

''Writing for understanding'', a 21st-century approach, adapts the principles of [[backward design]]&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, Grant &amp; McTighe, Jay:  ''The Understanding by Design Handbook'', ASCD, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; to teach students to write effectively. Writing for Understanding grew out of a recognition that most students require explicit instruction in both the knowledge and the structures that they need to construct meaning in writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Think Before You Write|journal=Educational Leadership|date=October 2006|first=Joanna|last=Hawkins|volume=64|issue=2|pages=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral processing and the extensive use of models and modeling are core teaching methodologies in this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kristen | last=Fountain | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Fresh Approach Vermont Educators Use New Methods to Teach Writing | date=2008-11-25 | publisher=Valley News | url = | work =Valley News | pages =C2–C3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Writing for Understanding Approach rests on three pillars: Backward Design, Understanding and Direct Instruction.  Students are given focused, intentional instruction and practice in:

* developing a knowledge and understanding which can be articulated in spoken and written language
* identifying an appropriate focus for thinking about and synthesizing that knowledge and understanding
* choosing a structure through which to clearly develop and present that knowledge and understanding
* establishing control over conventions.&lt;ref&gt;The Vermont Writing Collaborative: ''Writing for Understanding'', p.xiii.  Authentic Education, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for understanding teachers intentionally design instruction to enable students to appropriately generalize and transfer their skills to multiple contexts.  The Vermont Writing Collaborative [http://www.vermontwritingcollaborative.org/index.html] serves as a clearinghouse for information about Writing for Understanding and provides professional development, instructional materials and support for educators.

== The reading and apprenticeship connections ==
According to some writing theorists, reading for pleasure provides a more effective way of mastering the art of writing than does a formal study of writing, language, grammar, and vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding reading (4th ed.)|last=Smith|first=F.|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum.|year=1988|isbn=|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The power of reading|last=Krashen|first=S.|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=1993|isbn=|location=Englewood, CO|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The writer's mind|last=Hays|first=J. N. Hays et al. (eds.) (see chapter by Perl, S. Understanding composing)|publisher=National Council of Teachers of English|year=1983|isbn=|location=Urbana (IL)|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tate|first=G.|date=1993|title=A place for literature in freshman composition|url=|journal=College English|volume=55|pages=321|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Studies that sought to improve writing by providing reading experiences in place of grammar study or additional writing practice found that these experiences were as beneficial as, or more beneficial than, grammar study or extra writing practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stotsky|first=S.|date=1983|title=Research on reading/writing relationships: a synthesis and suggested directions|url=|journal=Language Arts|volume=60|page=637|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The apprenticeship approach provides one variant of the reading connection, arguing that the composition classroom should resemble pottery or piano workshops—minimizing dependence on excessive self-reflection, preoccupation with audience, and explicit rules.  By watching the master, according to Michael Polanyi,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personal knowledge|last=|first=|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1962|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an “apprentice unconsciously picks up the rules of the art, including those which are not explicitly known to the master himself.”  Writing instructors, according to this approach, serve as models and coaches, providing explicit feedback in response to the learner's compositions. Students focus their attention on the task at hand, and not on "an inaccessible and confusing multitude of explicit rules and strategies." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissany|first=M|date=1996|title=The Apprenticeship Approach to Writing Instruction|url=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/visiblelanguage/pdf/V30N3_1996_E.pdf|journal=Visible Language|volume=30|issue=3 |pages=284–313|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2009–present ==

In 2009, the [[National Governors Association]] Center for Best Practices (NGA Center) and the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]] (CCSSO) assumed the coordination of a state led effort called The Common Core State Standards Initiative.  In this initiative, "Governors and state commissioners of education from 48 states, 2 territories and the District of Columbia committed to developing a common core of state standards in English-language arts."&lt;ref&gt;Common Core State Standards Initiative: [http://www.corestandards.org/], Retrieved 30 Jan 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Common Core State Standards Initiative's focus, with regard to writing, is to prepare America's students for college and career writing. These standards indicate key points in English Language Arts Writing through outlining the following main categories: Text Types and Purposes; Production and Distribution of Writing; Research to Build and Present Knowledge; and Range of Writing. These main categories are divided into 10 concepts and skills which are introduced to students in Kindergarten and then built upon in every subsequent grade level. Complexity and rigor increase each year so students develop and master each concept and skill. This effort is ongoing and is certain to have a profound effect nationwide on writing curriculum and pedagogical practice over the next decade. The National Commission on Writing has challenged American public educators "to teach all students to write effectively, clearly and thoughtfully."&lt;ref&gt;National Commission on Writing: ''The Neglected 'R':  the Need for a Writing Revolution''. College Entrance Examination Board, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8370">{{redirect|Golden Egg}}
"'''To kill the Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs'''" is an idiom used of an unprofitable action motivated by greed. It refers to one of [[Aesop's Fables]], numbered 87 in the [[Perry Index]], a story that also has a number of Eastern analogues. Many other stories contain geese that lay golden eggs though certain versions change them for hens that lay golden eggs.

==The story and its moral==
[[Avianus]] and [[Caxton]] tell different stories of a goose that lays a golden egg, where other versions have a hen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/87.htm |title=The Man And The Golden Eggs |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[George Fyler Townsend|Townsend]]: "A cottager and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg every day. They supposed that the Hen must contain a great lump of gold in its inside, and in order to get the gold they killed [her]. Having done so, they found to their surprise that the Hen differed in no respect from their other hens. The foolish pair, thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived themselves of the gain of which they were assured day by day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/townsend/163.htm |title=Mythfolklore.net |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs - Project Gutenberg etext 19994.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs, illustrated by [[Milo Winter]] in a 1919 edition]]
In early tellings, there is sometimes a commentary warning against greed rather than a pithy moral. This is so in [[La Fontaine's Fables|Jean de La Fontaine]]'s fable  of ''La Poule aux oeufs d'or'' (Fables V.13),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oaks.nvg.org/fonta5.html#zehengoleg |title=Oaks.nvg.org |publisher=Oaks.nvg.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which begins with the sentiment that 'Greed loses all by striving all to gain' and comments at the end that the story can be applied to those who become poor by trying to outreach themselves. It is only later that the morals most often quoted today began to appear. These are 'Greed oft o’er reaches itself' (Joseph Jacobs, 1894)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/jacobs/57.htm |title=Mythfolklore.net |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Much wants more and loses all' ([[Samuel Croxall]], 1722).&lt;ref&gt;Available on Google Books, pp.228-9 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yNCdxCtV3pgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=samuel%20croxall%20%20aesop%27s%20fables&amp;source=gbs_slider_thumb#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20man%20and%20his%20goose&amp;f=false books.google.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable also that these are stories told of a goose rather than a hen.

The English idiom "Kill not the goose that lays the golden egg",&lt;ref name="Antiquity of Proverbs"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttHYAAAAMAAJ | title=The Antiquity of Proverbs: &lt;small&gt;Fifty Familiar Proverbs and Folk Sayings with Annotations and Lists of Connected Forms, Found in All Parts of the World&lt;/small&gt; | publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons | author=Marvin, Dwight Edwards | year=1922 | pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes shortened to "Killing the golden goose", derives from this fable. It is generally used of a short-sighted action that destroys the profitability of an asset. Caxton's version of the story has the goose's owner demand that it lay two eggs a day; when it replied that it could not, the owner killed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/caxton/724.htm |title=Mythfolklore.net |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same lesson is taught by [[Fables and Parables|Ignacy Krasicki]]'s different fable of "The Farmer:"
:::A farmer, bent on doubling the profits from his land,
:::Proceeded to set his soil a two-harvest demand.
:::Too intent thus on profit, harm himself he must needs:
:::Instead of corn, he now reaps corn-cockle and weeds.
There is another variant on the story, recorded by [[Syntipas]] (Perry Index 58) and appearing in [[Roger L'Estrange]]'s 1692 telling as "A Woman and a Fat Hen" (Fable 87): ''A good Woman had a Hen that laid her every day an Egg. Now she fansy’d to her self, that upon a larger Allowance of Corn, this Hen might be brought in time to lay twice a day. She try’d the Experiment; but the Hen grew fat upon’t, and gave quite over laying''. His comment on this is that 'we should set Bounds to our Desires, and content our selves when we are well, for fear of losing what we had.' Another of Aesop's fables with the moral of wanting more and losing everything is ''[[The Dog and the Bone]]''.

==Eastern instances==
An Eastern analogue is found in the ''Suvannahamsa Jataka'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j1/j1139.htm |title=Sacred-texts.com |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which appears in the fourth section of the Buddhist book of monastic discipline (''[[Vinaya]]''). In this the father of a poor family is reborn as a swan with golden feathers and invites them to pluck and sell a single feather from his wings to support themselves, returning occasionally to allow them another. The greedy mother of the family eventually plucks all the feathers at once, but they then turn to ordinary feathers; when the swan recovers its feathers they too are no longer gold. The moral drawn there is:
:::::''Contented be, nor itch for further store.
:::::''They seized the swan – but had its gold no more''.

North of India, in the formerly Persian territory of [[Sogdiana]], it was the Greek version of the story that was known. Among the 8th-century murals in [[Panjakent]], in the western Sugdh province of [[Tajikistan]], there is a panel from room 1, sector 21, representing a series of scenes moving from right to left where it is possible to recognize the same person first in the act of checking a golden egg and later killing the animal in order to get more eggs, only to understand the stupidity of his idea at the very end of the sequence. A local version of the story still persists in the area but ends differently with the main character eventually becoming a king.&lt;ref&gt;See Matteo Compareti's description of the murals at [http://Vitterhetsakad.se/pdf/uai/Compareti_Aesop.pdf vitterhetsakad.se]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' a story is recounted of wild birds that spit gold, and were discovered by a man who soon strangled them "out of greed".&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 2.55.10, Buitenen translation vol. 2, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in the arts==
The French text was set as the fourth of [[:nl:Rudolf Koumans|Rudolf Koumans]]' ''Vijf fabels van La Fontaine'' for children’s choir and orchestra (Op. 25 1968). Yassen Vodenitcharov (1964-) has created a chamber opera from the story (2004).

The majority of illustrations of "The Goose that laid the Golden Eggs" picture the farmer despairing after discovering that he has killed the goose to no purpose. It was also one of several fables applied to political issues by the American illustrator [[Thomas Nast]]. Captioned ''Always killing the goose that lays the golden eggs'', it appeared in ''[[Harpers Weekly]]'' for March 16, 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sophia.smith.edu/~maldrich/topics/labor_strikes/1878harpersmar16.htm |title=View online |publisher=Sophia.smith.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There the picture of the baffled farmer, advised by a 'Communistic Statesman', referred to the rail strike of 1877. The farmer stands for the politically driven union members whose wife and children sorrow in the background.

'''Yolanda Oreamuno Unger''' (8 April 1916 &amp;ndash; 8 July 1956) was a [[Costa Rica]]n writer. Her most acclaimed novel is ''La Ruta de su Evasión'' (1948). Her 40 years of life were markedly divided into two phases: the first 20 years, filled with youth, beauty and happiness, contrasted sharply with the following years of tragedy, loneliness and sickness.

==Early life==
Yolanda Oreamuno was the only child of Carlos Oreamuno Pacheco and Margarita Unger Salazar. Her father died before her first birthday, so she was mainly raised by her maternal grandmother, Eudoxia Salazar Salazar, whose husband Unger was deceased by then.&lt;ref name="women"&gt;''Spanish American Women Writers: A Bio-Bibliographical Source Book'', Diane E. Marting (Editor), Greenwood Press, 1990. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lrLI2BJkPu4C&amp;pg=PA394&amp;lpg=PA394&amp;dq=Jorge+Molina+Wood&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x7B7XhOyeX&amp;sig=pNiTpN0m6jZQpBMeapucCUOZwwA&amp;hl=ru&amp;ei=bZS2TuHaB-Pl4QSZnNj8Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Jorge%20Molina%20Wood&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; She obtained her secondary education in the Colegio Superior de Señoritas. She then studied bookkeeping and worked at the Costa Rican Post Office headquarters.

At the age of 20 she published her first two stories, "La lagartija de la panza blanca" and "Para Revenar, no para Max Jiménez".

==Marriage and adult life==
She was working in the [[Chile]]an embassy when she met the diplomat Jorge Molina Wood. They were married, and moved to that country. She recounted life during that time in her stories ''La mareas vuelven de noche'' and ''Don Junvencio'' (which remained unpublished until 1971). Her time in Chile was prolific; her stories appeared in ''[[Repertorio Americano]]'', including ''40º sobre cero'', ''18 de setiembre'', ''Misa de ocho'', ''Vela urbana'', ''El espíritu de mi tierra'', '' Insomnio'' and ''El negro, sentido de la alegría''. Their marriage, however, fell apart in 1936; her husband, weakened by an incurable disease, committed suicide. She returned to Costa Rica at the end of 1936.

In 1937 she married a lawyer, Óscar Barahona Streber, who was involved with the Costa Rican communist movement. They both participated in opposition activities.  Their son, Sergio Barahona Oreamuno, was born 8 December 1942. Their marriage did  not last; after their divorce, her ex-husband migrated to Guatemala.

She wrote her first novel, ''Por tierra firme'', in 1938. In 1940 she submitted it to a writing contest, winning a three-way first prize. However, she declined to share the honor with the others, and decided against sending the manuscript for publication; eventually the manuscript was lost.

[[File:Tumba de Yolanda Oreamuno.jpg|thumb|Oreamuno's tomb. The epitaph reads "Tal vez solo a la muerte se llega demasiado temprano" (perhaps only in death was she too early)]]
Oreamuno moved to Mexico, then decided to become a permanent [[Guatemala]]n citizen. However, by 1949 she was gravely ill, and she dwelt four months in a [[Washington D. C.]] hospital. She left the hospital to travel to Mexico City, to stay in the house of Costa Rican poet [[Eunice Odio]]. She died there in 1956. She was buried in a mausoleum in San Joaquín, D.F. In 1963 her remains were moved to San José.&lt;ref&gt;Armando G. Tejeda.

P. Morales. [http://miasfera.blogspot.com/2011/07/lo-que-dije-el-ocho-develando-la-placa.html ''Lo que dije el ocho, develando la placa de Y.O.''], ''Miasfera'', 10 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation of her work==
Her most renowned novel is La Ruta de su Evasión (1948). Oreamuno draws on narrative techniques that were uncommon in other Costa Rican writers. It is believed that authors like [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Marcel Proust]] influenced her literary creation. Costa Rican critic Abelardo Bonilla wrote that "In this as in all works of Yolanda Oreamuno there is boldness of conception and form, but there is a lack of internal unity".&lt;ref&gt;Bonilla, Abelardo. (1971). Historia de la literatura costarricense, Editorial STVDIUM, San José, San José, Costa Rica: p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Analitik''' ({{lang-ru|Аналитик}}) is a [[programming language]]&lt;ref name=io89.pl.tl/&gt;, developed in 1968&lt;ref name=compiler.su/&gt;&lt;ref name=dspace.nbuv.gov.ua/&gt;&lt;ref name=cendomzn.ucoz.ru/&gt;&lt;ref name=edu.sernam.ru/&gt; (in [[USSR]]) at the Institute of Cybernetics of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|Academy of Sciences]] of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]. It is the development of the [[ALMIR-65]] language&lt;ref name=notes.sochi.org.ru/&gt; keeping compatibility with it.

A distinctive feature of the language are abstract data types, calculations in arbitrary algebras, and analytic transformations.

It was implemented on [[МИР-2|MIR-2]] machines&lt;ref name=cendomzn.ucoz.ru/&gt;.

Later a version of [[Аналитик-74|Analitik-74]] was developed, implemented on [[МИР-3|MIR-3]]&lt;ref name=compiler.su/&gt; machines.

At the moment the language ANALITIK exists as a computer algebra system [[Аналитик-2010|Analitik-2010]], which is being developed jointly by the Institute of Mathematical Machines and Systems of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and the [[Poltava National Technical University]].

Разработан в 1968 в Институте кибернетики АН УССР. В качестве подмножества Аналитик содержит язык машины «МИР». Аналитик непосредственно интерпретируется в машине «МИР-2».
