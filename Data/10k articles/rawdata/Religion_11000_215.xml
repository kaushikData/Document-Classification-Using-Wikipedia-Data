'''''Jannat al-Baqīʿ''''' ({{lang-ar|جَنَّة ٱلْبَقِيع|lit=Garden of the Baqi}}) is a [[cemetery]] in [[Medina]], the [[Hijaz]]i&lt;ref name="MWGD2001"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |co-authors= |title=Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary |page=479 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Co_VIPIJerIC&amp;pg=PA479 |year=2001 |isbn=0 87779 546 0 |access-date=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; region of present-day [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is located to the southeast of the [[Prophet's Mosque]], which contains the [[grave]] of [[Muhammad]]. It is also known as '''''Baqīʿ al-Gharqad''''' ({{lang-ar|بَقِيْع الْغَرْقَد}}, meaning "Baqiʿ of the [[Boxthorn]]").&lt;ref name="EI"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Werner |first=Ende |author-link= |editor-last=Fleet |editor-first=Kate |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam |title=Baqīʿ al-Gharqad |trans-title= |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/baqi-al-gharqad-COM_23494?s.num=119&amp;s.rows=100&amp;s.start=20 |access-date=28 August 2016 |language= |edition=Third |date= |year=2010 |publisher= |series= |volume= |location= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |pages= |quote= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grounds hold much significance for [[Muslim]]s, being the resting place of many of Muhammad's relatives and companions. Many traditions relate Muhammad issuing a prayer every time he passed it. A [[Jewish]] graveyard was once located behind Jannat al-Baqi. The [[Umayyad]] rulers took down the wall of the Jewish cemetery and widened the Muslim graveyard to enclose the tomb of [[Rashidun Caliphate|Caliph]] [[Uthman ibn Affan]] within it.&lt;ref name="Knappert et al."&gt;Textual Sources for the Study of Islam, by Knappert, Jan, and Andrew Rippin&lt;/ref&gt;

When Muhammad arrived at Medina from [[Mecca]] in September 622 [[Common Era|CE]], al-Baqi' was a land covered with ''[[Lycium shawii]]'' boxthorn trees. According to historical records, after the arrival of Muhammad, the houses of Medina developed near Baqi', which was therefore considered as the public tomb. Also Baqi' was introduced as somewhere which its east side is Nakhl and its west side there are houses. In fact, before demolition Baqi was located behind the houses in the city.&lt;ref name="Najmi"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ebookshia.com/books/pdf/6333/%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%AE+%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%85+%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%85%D9%87+%D8%A8%D9%82%DB%8C%D8%B9+%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%87%D9%85+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85+%D9%88+%D8%A2%D8%AB%D8%A7%D8%B1+%D8%AF%DB%8C%DA%AF%D8%B1+%D8%AF%D8%B1+%D9%85%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%86%D9%87+%D9%85%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%87 |title=history of tombs of Imam in Baqi and other monuments |author=Muhammad Sadiq Najmi |page=67-68 |publisher=Mashar |language=[[Farsi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the construction of the Prophet's Mosque, on the site he purchased from two orphan children when he arrived after his migration from Mecca to Medina, Asa'ad Bin Zararah, one of Muhammad's companions died. Muhammad chose the spot to be a cemetery and Asa'ad was the first individual to be buried in al-Baqi among the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]].

While Muhammad was outside Medina for the [[Battle of Badr]], his daughter [[Ruqayyah]] fell sick and died in 624. She was buried in al-Baqi 

Shortly after Muhammad arrived from Badr, [[Uthman bin Maz'oon]] died and was buried in al-Baqi. He was considered the first companion of Muhammad from the [[Muhajirun]] to be buried in the cemetery.

Earlier, [[Caliph]] Uthman ibn Affan&lt;ref name="Knappert et al."/&gt; was buried in the huge neighbouring Jewish grave yard. The first enlargement of al-Baqi in history was made by [[Muawiyah I]], the first Umayyad Caliph. In order to honour Uthman ibn Affan, Muawiyah included the huge Jewish graveyard into al-Baqi cemetery. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] built the first dome in al-Baqi over his grave. During different times of history, many domes and structures were built or rebuilt over many famous graves in al-Baqi.

At the beginning of the [[Wahhabi|Wahhabis of Najd]]'s nineteenth century (1806) control over Mecca and Medina, they demolished many of the religious buildings including tombs and mosques, whether inside or outside the Baqi,&lt;ref name="Islamic Magazine"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Ahmed |first=Irfan |magazine=Islamica Magazine |date= |title=The Destruction Of The Holy Sites in Mecca and Medina |url=http://islamicamagazine.com/?p=424 |issue=15 |dead-url=yes |location= |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713063137/http://islamicamagazine.com/?p=424 |archive-date=13 July 2011 |access-date=7 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with their doctrine.&lt;ref name="EI"/&gt; These were razed to the ground&lt;ref name="Islamica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Bahramian |first1=Ali|last2=Gholami|first2=Rahim|editor-last1=Madelung |editor-first1=Wilfred|editor-last2=Daftary |editor-first2=Farhad|editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Islamica |title=al-Baqīʿ|trans-title= |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-islamica/al-baqi-COM_00000066|access-date= 2 September 2016|language= |edition= Third |date= |year=2013 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="al-Islam"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Cemetery Of Jannat Al-Baqi|url=https://www.al-islam.org/history-shrines/history-cemetery-jannat-al-baqi|website=Al-Islam.org|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plundered for their decorations and goods.&lt;ref name="cgie"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Bahramian |first1=Ali |editor-link= |encyclopedia=The Great Islamic Encyclopedia |title=Baqi |trans-title= |url=http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/7898 |access-date=9 September 2016 |language=fa |edition= |date= |year= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clan of Saud regained control of the Hijaz in 1924&lt;ref name="Islamica" /&gt; or 1925.&lt;ref name="EI" /&gt; The following year [[Ibn Saud|King Ibn Saud]] granted permission to destroy the site with religious authorization provided by [[Qadi]] [[Abd Allah ibn Bulayhid]], and the demolition began on 21 April 1926&lt;ref name="Islamica" /&gt; (or 1925)&lt;ref name="Mohammadi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afshin" /&gt; by ''[[Ikhwan]]'' ("The Brothers"), a Wahabbi religious militia.&lt;ref name="CASS"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Destruction Heritage in Saudi Arabia |url=http://www.shiaresearch.com/Doc/Destruction-of-Islamic-Heritage-in-Saudi.pdf|publisher=The Center for Academic Shi'a Studies |accessdate=14 September 2016|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demolition included destroying "even the simplest of the gravestones".&lt;ref name="EI" /&gt; British convert Eldon Rutter compared the demolition to an earthquake: "All over the cemetery nothing was to be seen but little indefinite mounds of earth and stones, pieces of timber, iron bars, blocks of stone, and a broken rubble of cement and bricks, strewn about."&lt;ref name="Islamica" /&gt;

The second demolition was discussed in ''[[National Consultative Majlis|Majles-e Shora-ye Melli]]'' (The National Consultative Assembly of [[Iran]]) and a group of representatives was sent to Hijaz to investigate.

The ''āsrava'', that is, the influx of karmic occurs when the karmic particles are attracted to the soul on account of vibrations created by activities of mind, speech and body.{{sfn|George|2008|p=328}}&lt;ref name=Jaini112&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 }} p.112&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jain text, [[Tattvartha sutra]], translates S.A. Jain: {{quote|''yoga'' (activity) i.e. the action of the body, the organ of speech and the mind is the reason for ''asrava''.|[[Tattvārthasūtra]] (6:1–2){{sfn|Jain|2011|p=80}}}} The karmic inflow on account of ''yoga'' driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of ''karma'' prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kuhn | first =Hermann | title =Karma, The Mechanism : Create Your Own Fate | publisher =Crosswind Publishing | year =2001 | location =Wunstorf, Germany | isbn =3-9806211-4-6 }} p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Tatia | first = Nathmal | title =Tattvārtha Sūtra: That Which Is of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =Rowman Altamira | year =1994 | location =Lanham, MD | language =Sanskrit, English | isbn =0-7619-8993-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jains, ''āsrava'' refers to the influx of very fine matter particles. [[Champat Rai Jain]] in his book, ''The Key of Knowledge'' writes:&lt;ref name = "key"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|title=The Key Of Knowledge|date=1975|publisher=Today and Tomorrow's Printers|location=New Delhi|edition=Third|url=https://archive.org/details/keyofknowledge|p=621}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|To begin with ''āsrava'', the first thing to grasp is that there can be no bondage of pure mental abstractions, or purely wordy concepts; the word signifies some kind of real fetters, not, indeed, consisting in chains of iron, but of some very subtle and fine kind of matter. It is well to know that nothing but force, in some form or other, is capable of exercising restraint or of holding living beings in the condition of captivity, and that no kind of force is conceivable apart from a substance of some kind or other. The bondage of soul must, therefore, be the bondage of matter, the only substance which is known to enter into interaction with souls, and the obtainment of freedom must consequently imply the removal of the particles of this foreign material from the constitution of the ego.|Champat Rai Jain}}

== Classification ==
There are two kinds of influx, namely:{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=81}}
#that of persons with passions, which extends transmigration, and
#that of persons free from passions, which prevents or shortens transmigration

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11200">In contrast with many Indian religious traditions, [[Buddhism]] does not regard the body and the mind or spirit as being two entirely separate entities - there is no sense in Buddhism that the body is a "vessel" that is guided or inhabited by the mind or spirit.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{citation

Buddhist attitudes towards the body itself are complex, combining the distaste for sensual pleasure that characterizes the general Buddhist view towards desire with a recognition of both the individuals dependence on the body, and the utility of the body as an aide in the development of insight.  Issues of gender, the mortification of the body, and the body as a source of troublesome desire are all addressed within the Buddhist scriptural tradition directly, while Buddhist attitudes towards other, more contemporary issues have continued to develop and change in response to the social and material changes in modern society.

==Historical and scriptural perspectives==

===Views===

==== Place ====
The Buddhist tradition regards the body and the mind as being mutually dependent.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;  The body or physical form (called ''rupa'') is considered as one of the five ''[[skandha]]'', the five interdependent components that constitute an individual.  The [[Buddha]] taught that there is no separate, permanent, or unchanging self, and that a human being is an impermanent composite of interdependent physical, emotional and cognitive components.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_1CPzX7kjkgC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=anatta|title=Encountering Religion|author=Ian S. Markham, Tinu Ruparell|pages=197–198|isbn=978-0-631-20674-3|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Identifying either the body or the mind as the self is dismissed as a mistaken view by the Buddha; in the [[Anatta-lakkhana Sutta]], it is clearly stated that none of the five ''skandha'' should be regarded as the self.&lt;ref name="SN22.59"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.059.than.html Panacavaggi Sutta/Anatta-lakkhana Sutta]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional sources often emphasize the attitude that the body should be subordinate to the mind; scriptures depict the Buddha instructing followers to look beyond physical discomfort and leave their minds undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3nIRK8pr3wC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=buddhism+body|title=Buddhist Psychology|author=Edwina Pio|year=1988|isbn=978-81-7017-246-8|pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health and mortification====
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

==== Revulsion ====
Though perhaps less concerned with issues of purity and pollution than the [[Historical Vedic religion|Brahmanist]] tradition, certain views of the body recorded in Buddhist scriptures do depict the body as unwholesome and potentially an object of disgust.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;  This is the “unwantedness” of a body in the tradition of Buddhism identified by some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Griffiths On Being Mindless La Salle, Ill. : Open Court, c1986&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting on the loathsomeness of the body is considered to be a particularly powerful method for countering attachment to sensual pleasures, such as sexuality or pride in appearance.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;  Stories recorded in scriptures and in the biographies of Buddhist teachers particularly focus on the contemplation of the foulness of the female body as a remedy for sexual desire in a male religious practitioner.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

==== Value ====
In contrast to views of the body as disgusting or a source of unworthy desire, the Buddhist tradition does speak of the value of the body in the context of the preciousness of human birth, and the value of a healthy body as an aid to pursuing the Buddhist path.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;  While contemplating the repulsiveness of the body is considered to be a powerful remedy for sensual attachment, this is a therapeutic perspective that is not necessarily intended to be carried over into other areas of life.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;  In particular, the suitability of the human body for the pursuit of religious practice is praised in traditional sources, comparing favorably with the capacities of birth among the gods or the various chthonic realms.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

===Meditation===
Scriptures and meditation text depict a number of meditation methods that focus particularly on the body.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;
The passage of the breath through the body is particularly common.  Entire sutras are devoted to contemplating [[breathing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-83TWlTjU8C&amp;pg=PA62|title=The complete idiot's guide to understanding Buddhism|page=62|year=2002|author=Gary Gach|isbn=978-0-02-864170-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other meditations, used to counter attachment to sensuality, contemplate the frailty of the body - sickness, old age and death - to develop a sense of disgust with it.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= An introduction to Buddhist psychology|page=146|author=Padmasiri De Silva|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7425-0857-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1RQGAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Analytic meditations - which break down the body into either its anatomical components or in terms of traditional [[Classical element|elements]] - are intended to develop in the practitioner a knowledge of [[anatman]], the Buddhist principle that no permanent enduring self exists within the individual.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

=== Desire ===
{{see also|Buddhism and sexuality}}

"the engine for sex exemplifies ignorant craving quintessentially,”.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald S. Critical Terms for the Study of Buddhism. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. 2005. Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, “Sexual desire traps us; it renders us slaves to pleasure, slaves to our partners, slaves to the body itself. And it never brings satisfaction; rather, sex causes conflict, burns the mind, and brings us into bad company.” Sex can be seen as a primary reason of continuing samsara, after all, it did bring us into our discontented existence. Nonetheless, sex is not forbidden and Buddhists are aware that laymen and women will still have sex, so “A symbiotic relationship between the monastic order and lay adherents has characterized Buddhism from the beginning, with a dual sexual ethical track: Buddhism has traditionally held celibate monasticism in the highest regard, but it has also seen marriage and family life as highly suitable for those who cannot commit themselves to celibacy, and as an arena in which many worthwhile qualities are nurtured.”.&lt;ref&gt;Numrich, Paul David. "The Problem with Sex According to Buddhism." Dialog: A Journal of Theology 48.1 (Spring 2009-2009): 62-73. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. [Library name], [City], [State abbreviation]. 13 Mar. 2009 &lt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=36650277&amp;site=ehost-live&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; For the laypeople, some guidelines regarding normal, ethical sexual behavior can be found. For example, sex should only be between married couples, it should not be done on religious holidays or within the area of sacred shrines, and there are some examples of sexual misconduct, like oral and anal sex&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald S. Critical Terms for the Study of Buddhism. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. 2005. Page 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary Views ==
There are a number of issues relating to the body that, though given little attention in traditional Buddhist sources, have assumed significant importance in the modern world.  Contemporary Buddhist views on these issues vary greatly between different cultures and individuals, and may combine the reinterpretation of traditional views with a variety of other influences.

=== Addiction ===
Buddhist scriptures talk a great deal about the general idea of attachment to sensual pleasures, but do not directly address the issue of substance addiction as it is understood in contemporary society.  Jataka stories and certain rules governing lay and monastic behavior do discuss the use of alcohol and intoxicants.

===Suicide===
{{see also|Religious views of suicide}}

The issue of suicide can be difficult to address since the Buddha never stated what he thought about this topic.  In Buddhism, [[suicide]] can be seen as an immoral act or it can be justified under certain circumstances. "The topic of suicide has been chosen not only for its intrinsic factual and historical interest but because it spotlights certain key issues in the field of Buddhist ethics and doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;Wiltshire, Martin G. (1983) "The 'Suicide' Problem in the Pali Canon," Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 6, pp. 124-140&lt;/ref&gt; This raises a lot of questions whether suicide is right or wrong in Buddhism or if the Buddha believed that suicide can be condoned. Some Buddhists may say that only the Enlightened can commit suicide. “(suicide) can be either right or wrong depending on the state of mind of the person who suicides: the presence of desire (or fear) makes it wrong, and the absence of desire (or fear) makes it right”. The story of Channa is one of the strongest stories, which question whether suicide can be justified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistethics.org/3/keown.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

“Channa was an unenlightened person (puthujjana) who, afflicted by the pain and distress of a serious illness, took his own life. This story however, raises a lot of questions whether the Buddha condoned suicide.”  “Channa was not an arhat until the point of death those who suggests that suicide is wrong for a non- arhat would have to accept that Channa was wrong to commit the act”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma/suicide.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that there are some Buddhists who commit suicide and then become enlightened when they are about to kill themselves. The only person that can commit suicide is a bodhisattva. A bodhisattva might risk life and limb for the good of others.&lt;ref&gt;John Renard, 101 questions and answers to Buddhism, New York : Paulist Press, c1999&lt;/ref&gt;

To seek one's death or to make death one’s aim (even when the motive is compassionate, directed toward reducing suffering) is to negate in the most fundamental way the values and final goal of Buddhism by destroying what the traditional sources call the “precious human life” we have the rare good fortune to obtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1051472 | volume=13 | pages=385–405}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also said that a person who commits suicide will simply be reborn with the additional bad karma of the suicide to contend with.

'''Cueva de Achbinico''', also called '''cave of San Blas''' ({{lang-es|cueva de Achbinico}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[church architecture|church]] and cave located in [[Candelaria, Tenerife|Candelaria]], [[Tenerife]], [[Canary Islands]] ([[Spain]]).

After the [[conquest of the Canary Islands]] it was the first Christian sanctuary of religious significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.candelaria.es/opencms/opencms/ayuntamiento_es/bloques/nuestroMunicipio/presentacion.html Presentación, municipio de Candelaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113013845/http://www.candelaria.es/opencms/opencms/ayuntamiento_es/bloques/nuestroMunicipio/presentacion.html |date=2010-11-13 }} in ''candelaria.es''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first sanctuary dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]] in the Canary Islands, where the [[Virgin of Candelaria]], the patron saint of the Canary islands, was worshipped.

== Situation and presentation ==
The cave is located on the coast, just behind the [[basilica of Candelaria|basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria]].
It is elongated and deep, with a ceiling shaped as a dome. It is 14 meters long by 6 meters wide and 5 meters high. A small chapel was built just outside of it, covering and including within its walls the entrance of the cave.

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Inside the cave is a bronze replica of the Virgin of Candelaria. Her statue is most venerated on the island, and has turned the cave into the most important pilgrimage centre in the Canaries for the past 5 centuries. It is still visited by pilgrims, who commonly take and leave flushed candles and do requests to the Virgin.

The Achbinico cave has a great importance, not only religious but also historic and prehistoric.

[[File:Virgen de la Candelaria Cueva de Achbinico Tenerife.jpg|thumb|Statue of the Virgin of Candelaria, in the cave of Achbinico.|alt=|center]]
== History ==
The cave long served as a [[Christian]] worship place. When the statue of the [[Virgin of Candelaria]] was found on [[Güimar]]'s beach of Chimisay at the end of the 14th century, the island had not yet been conquered by the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and its native inhabitants were the [[Guanches]]. The statue's finders brought it to [[Acaymo]], the Guanche king (or ''[[mencey]]''), at his [[cave of Chinguaro|cave-palace of Chinguaro]]. The statue was [[translation (relic)|translated]] to the Achbinico cave in 1446, the ceremony accompanied with popular celebrations.

In one of the walls of the cave there is a picture explaining the story of the translation of the Virgin. In the lower part of it is a text that says:

{{quote|''Upon advice of [[Guanches|Guanche]] Antón, Hernán Peraza's page boy, king [[Acaymo]] of [[Güimar]] translated the statue of [[Our Lady of Candelaria]], from his palace of Chinguaro, to this cave of Achbinico''.}}

Guanches were baptized in the cave. The original baptismal font used to this effect is preserved in the basilica's [[camarín]].

In 1497, Tenerife conqueror [[Alonso Fernandez de Lugo]] held in this cave the first celebration of [[Candlemas]], at the same time as the Festivity of the Purification of the Virgin.

In 1526, on February 2 ([[Candlemas]]), the Virgin was [[translation (relic)|translated]] from the cave to its new chapel. The current [[basilica of Candelaria]], the primary Marian shrine of the Canary Islands, was built later in 1959. It sits over the remains of a small church that had burned down a few hundred meters away from the cave.

King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] was declared protector of the Virgin of Candelaria. After ascending the throne, the Spanish monarch gave the title of "Royal" to this sanctuary - the first sanctuary in the [[Canary Islands]] to have received that title.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.laopinion.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=2009020700_25_197498__Afondo-Medio-siglo-fervor-Candelaria Medio siglo de fervor en Candelaria (Historia del Santuario)] ("Half a century of fervor in Candlemas (History of the Sanctuary)").&lt;/ref&gt;

In this cave there is also a statue of saint Blas, whose original statue was placed there in 1530 and substituted much later with the present one from sculptor [[Fernando Estévez]]. Thus the cave remains honoured by the statue of a saint and maintains its tradition of worship in February: on February 2 there is a religious ceremony in honour of the Virgin of Candelaria and on February 3 the worship is dedicated to saint Blas, with the statue carried out in procession around the [[plaza de la Patrona de Canarias]]. This is why the Achbinico cave is also called Saint Blas' cave, with both names in use.

== Prehistory ==
Various archaeological excavations have proved that the cave was a place of worship long before the Guanches placed the statue of the Virgin in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://elguanche.net/Benchomo/arquitecturacanariapre8.htm Arquitectura canaria precolonial] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612085142/http://elguanche.net/Benchomo/arquitecturacanariapre8.htm# |date=2010-06-12 }} in ''elguanche.net''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent excavations, the layers of ashes found there and subjected to [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon-14 dating]] indicate an age of more than 3000 years. In this cave a permanent fire had been maintained, such as in the [[Vestal Virgins|vestal temples]] of Antique Rome. This sacred character held from very ancient times would explain that after the conquest the original inhabitants of the Canary Islands placed the Virgin precisely in this cave and nowhere else.

Radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at the age of five,&lt;ref name="agefive"&gt;{{cite news |title=Faces of the week: DANIEL RADCLIFFE |publisher=BBC News |date=2 March 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6413257.stm |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 1999, aged 10, he made his acting debut in [[BBC One]]'s [[David Copperfield (1999 film)|televised two-part adaptation]] of the [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[David Copperfield]]'', portraying the [[David Copperfield (character)|title character]] as a young boy.&lt;ref name="dcref1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts |first=Sheila |title=Daniel Radcliffe Interview, December Boys |publisher=Movies Online |date=10 September 2007 |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_12913.html |accessdate=27 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411092919/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_12913.html |archivedate=11 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at three [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]] for boys: [[Redcliffe School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/daniel-radcliffe-on-alcoholism-starving-himself-harry-potter---a|title=Daniel Radcliffe on alcoholism, starving himself, Harry Potter - and the day he fell in love|newspaper=The Telegraph|last1=Williams |first1=Sally|date=1 July 2016|access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a day school in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]'s [[Redcliffe Square]], [[Sussex House School]],&lt;ref name="parade09info"/&gt; a day school in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]'s [[Cadogan Square]],&lt;ref name="Sussex"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Sussex House School, London |publisher=Independent Special Boarding International}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[City of London School]], a day school on the North Bank of the [[River Thames]] in London's financial district (known as the [[City of London]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/9071566/Daniel-Radcliffes-next-trick.html|title=Daniel Radcliffe's Next Trick|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 February 2012|accessdate=3 November 2012|location=London|first=Sally|last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe after the release of [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|the first ''Harry Potter'' film]], with some fellow pupils becoming hostile, though he says it was people just trying to "have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter" rather than jealousy.&lt;ref name="details07"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/cover-stars/200706/meet-the-new-grown-up-harry-potter-star-daniel-radcliffe?currentPage=2 |title=DANIEL RADCLIFFE |first=Simon |last=Garfield |work=[[Details (magazine)|Details]] |page=2 |date=June 2007 |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his acting career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe continued his education through on-set tutors. He admitted he was not very good at school, considering it useless and finding the work "really difficult."&lt;ref name="parade09info"/&gt; He achieved A grades in the three [[GCE Advanced Level|AS-level exams]] that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university.&lt;ref name="exams"&gt;{{cite web |last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer |title='Harry Potter' Star Daniel Radcliffe Gets Leather-y in Racy Photo Spread |publisher=MTV |date=10 July 2007 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1564452/daniel-radcliffe-gets-leathery-photo-spread.jhtml|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/9695962/Daniel-Radcliffe-Ive-always-had-an-intolerance-for-bad-behaviour.html |title=Daniel Radcliffe: 'I've always had an intolerance for bad behaviour'|last1=Farndale |first1=Nigel |date=26 November 2012 |website=www.telegraph.co.uk |publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=21 June 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write, and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience. "The [[paparazzi]], they'd love it," he told [[Details (magazine)|''Details'' magazine]] in 2007. "If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were."&lt;ref name="details07"/&gt;

The release of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' (released as ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' in the United States) took place in 2001. Radcliffe received a seven figure salary for the lead role, but asserted that the fee was "not that important" to him;&lt;ref name="maincastinter"&gt;{{cite news|title=When Danny Met Harry |work=The Times |location=UK |date=3 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; his parents chose to invest the money for him.&lt;ref name="potteranquus"/&gt; The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews, and critics took notice of Radcliffe:&lt;ref name="rtscore"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/daniel_radcliffe/|title = Daniel Radcliffe|work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher = Flixster|accessdate = 28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Radcliffe is the embodiment of every reader's imagination. It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions, from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing," wrote Bob Graham of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/05/31/DD77471.DTL#ixzz1NpMxbWrG |title='Potter's' amazing powers |first=Bob |last=Graham |work=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=Hearst Communications Inc |date=31 May 2002 |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harry Potter cast.jpg|thumb|left|Handprints, footprints and wand prints of (from left to right) Watson, Radcliffe, Grint, at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood.]]
A year later Radcliffe starred in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', the second installment of the series. Reviewers were positive about the lead actors' performances but had polarised opinions on the movie as a whole. The 2004 release ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' was the third film in the series. Radcliffe's performance was panned by ''New York Times'' journalist [[A. O.

[[File:Darab by Eugène Flandin.jpg|thumb|280px|Drawing of Darab during the [[Qajar Persia|Qajar]] period by [[Eugène Flandin]]]]

'''Darab''' ({{lang-fa|Dārāb}}, also [[Romanize]]d as '''Dārāb''')&lt;ref&gt;{{GEOnet3|-3059243}}&lt;/ref&gt; — formerly '''Darábghird''', or '''Darábgerd''' — is a city and capital of [[Darab County]], [[Fars Province]], [[Iran]].  At the 2006 census, its population was 54,513, in 13,279 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{IranCensus2006|07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around Darab are many villages such as [[Bargan]], [[Tizab, Fars|Tizab]], Nasravan, Barab.

==Historical background==
Darab city one of the oldest cities in Iran, and is even mentioned in the famous Persian epic [[Shahname]] by [[Ferdowsi]]. Legend ascribes the foundation of the city to [[Darius I]], hence its earlier name Daráb-gerd (Darius-town).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Daráb |volume=7 |page=826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the neighborhood there are various remains, including the Kalah i Daráb (citadel of Darius), which consists of a series of [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] arranged in a circle around an isolated rock. Another monument in the vicinity is a giant [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-relief]], carved on the vertical face of a rock, representing the victory of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Shapur I]] over the Roman emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] in 260 A.D.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Agricultural products==
Major city products are wheat, citrus, cotton, maize and palm.

==In literature==
In the notes to his long mystical poem ''[[The Kasidah]]'' (1880), Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]] describes his alter ego, "Haji Abdu El-Yezdi" as being a native of Darab.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5636">{{For|the Epicurean philosopher, also from Seleucia|Diogenes of Seleucia}} 
'''Diogenes of Babylon''' (also known as '''Diogenes of Seleucia'''; {{lang-grc-gre|Διογένης Βαβυλώνιος}}; {{lang-la|Diogenes Babylonius}}; c. 230 – c. 150/140 BC{{sfn|Dorandi|1999|pp=50–51}}) was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher. He was the [[scholarch|head]] of the Stoic school in [[Athens]], and he was one of three philosophers sent to [[Rome]] in 155 BC. He wrote many works, but [[lost books| none of his writings survive]], except as quotations by later writers.

==Life==
Born in [[Seleucia on the Tigris]] in [[Babylonia]], Diogenes was educated at [[Athens]] under the auspices of [[Chrysippus]] and succeeded [[Zeno of Tarsus]] as head (''[[scholarch]]'') of the Stoic school there in the 2nd century BC.  Among his pupils were [[Panaetius]] and [[Antipater of Tarsus]] who succeeded him as scholarch.  He seems to have closely followed the views of Chrysippus, especially on [[dialectic]], in which he is said to have instructed [[Carneades]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 30; ''De Oratore'', ii. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Carneades and [[Critolaus]], he was sent to [[Rome]] to appeal a fine of hundred [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] imposed on Athens in 155 BC for the sack of [[Oropos|Oropus]].  They delivered their [[epideictic]] speeches first in numerous private assemblies, then in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].  Diogenes pleased his audience chiefly by his sober and temperate mode of speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Attic Nights'', vii. 14; Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cicero]] speaks of him as deceased by 150 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Senectute'', 23&lt;/ref&gt; and since [[Lucian]] claims that he died at the age of 80,&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Macrobii'', 20&lt;/ref&gt; he must have been born around 230 BC. There is some evidence, however, that he may have lived to around 140 BC.&lt;ref&gt;"[the traditional] chronology clashes with the dates for [[Mnesarchus of Athens|Mnesarchus]] and [[Dardanus of Athens|Dardanus]] and with the crucial events in the life of [[Antiochus of Ascalon]]. The date of Diogenes' death can reasonably be put forward at least a decade, to around 140" {{harv|Dorandi|1999|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Cicero calls Diogenes "a great and important Stoic".&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Officiis'', iii. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  In the works of the [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] philosopher [[Philodemus]] found in carbonized [[papyrus]] rolls recovered from the ruins of the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], Diogenes is discussed more frequently than any philosopher besides [[Epicurus]] himself.{{sfn|Obbink|2004|pp=73–84}}

He was the author of several works, of which, however, little more than the titles is known: 
* Διαλεκτικὴ τέχνη – ''Dialectic Art''.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 51}}
* ''On Divination''.&lt;ref&gt;''De divinatione'': [[Latin]] title given in Cicero, ''De Divinatione'', i. 3, ii. 43&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''On [[Athena]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''De Minerva'': Latin title given in Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
* Περὶ τοῦ τῆς ψυχῆς ἡγεμονικοῦ – ''On the Ruling Faculty of the Soul''.&lt;ref&gt;Galen.{{full|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Περὶ φωνῆς – ''On Speaking''.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 55}}
* Περὶ εὐγενείας – ''Οn Noble Βirth''.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, iv. 168&lt;/ref&gt;
* Περὶ νόμων – ''On Laws''.&lt;ref&gt;In several books, the first of which is quoted in Athenaeus, xii.; cf. Cicero, ''De Legibus'' iii. 5, where "Dio" is a false reading for "Diogenes"&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it appears from Philodemus that he wrote extensive works ''On Music'' and ''On Rhetoric''.{{sfn|Easterling|Knox|1989|pp=195–196}} Some aspects of his views on these two subjects are recoverable from the critical remarks to be found in Philodemus' works on these two subjects.{{sfn|Easterling|Knox|1989|pp=195–196}} There are several passages in Cicero from which we may infer that Diogenes wrote on other subjects also, such as duty, the highest good, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Officiis'', iii. 12, 13, 23; ''De Finibus'', iii. 10, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33050">An '''elder''' in [[Christianity]] is a person who is valued for [[wisdom]] and holds a position of responsibility and authority in a Christian group. In some Christian traditions (e.g., [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Methodism]]) an ''elder'' is an [[ordination|ordained]] person who usually serves a local [[Local church|church]] or churches and who has been ordained to a ministry of word, [[sacrament]] and order, filling the preaching and pastoral offices. In other Christian traditions (e.g., [[Presbyterianism]], [[Baptists]], [[Plymouth Brethren]]), an elder may be a [[lay person]] charged with serving as an administrator in a local, or be ordained to such an office, also serving in the preaching (in this case referring to teaching done during church gatherings) or pastoral roles. There is technically a distinction between the idea of ordained elders and lay elders, often the two concepts are conflated in everyday conversation (for example, a lay elder in the Baptist tradition may still be referred to as being "clergy", especially in America). Particularly in reference to age and experience, elders exist throughout world cultures,&lt;ref&gt;''The Human Elder in Nature, Culture, and Society'' by David Gutmann, 1997, Westview Press, {{ISBN|0-8133-2973-6}}, Preface&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Iftikhar''World Cultures: a Global Mosaic'' (1993) Prentice Hall, page 14: "In cultures with extended families, respect for elders is strong. The elders pass on their wisdom to the young."&lt;/ref&gt; and the Christian sense of elder is partially related to this.

==Elders in the Bible==
Elders are mentioned in a number of New Testament passages. Individuals such as [[James the Just|James]] had a significant role in the Jerusalem church and the [[Council of Jerusalem]].{{Bibleref2c|Acts|11:30}}{{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|15:2-6}}{{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|15:22-23}}{{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|16:4}}{{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|21:18}} In reference to churches in [[Antioch, Pisidia]], [[Iconium]], [[Lystra]] and [[Derbe]], Paul appoints elders{{Bibleref2c|Acts|14:23}} as a key step in organizing a new church and instructs [[Saint Titus|Titus]] to appoint others.{{Bibleref2c|Tit|1:5}} Paul spoke directly to the elders in [[Acts]]{{Bibleref2c|Acts|20:17}} and warned them to "be on guard for themselves and for all the flock, among which the [[Holy Spirit]] has made them overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood."&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Acts 20:28]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

===Terminology===
The Christian office of "elder" is drawn from the word's various uses in the [[Bible]]. In many instances, particularly in the [[Old Testament]], it has reference to the older men in a tribe, usually entrusted with the governmental affairs{{Bibleref2c|Exod|3:16}}{{Bibleref2c-nb|Exod|4:29}}{{Bibleref2c-nb|Exod|12:21}}{{Bibleref2c|Josh|7:6}}{{Bibleref2c|Ruth|4:2}}, whose counsel was frequently sought because of their age and experience. This was not necessarily a priesthood calling,{{Bibleref2c|Gen|50:7}}{{Bibleref2c|Ruth|4:2}}{{Bibleref2c|Matt|15:2}}{{Bibleref2c|Acts|4:5}} although the [[Kohen|Aaronic Priesthood]] is listed as having ordained elders.{{Bibleref2c|Exod|24:9-11}}{{Bibleref2c|Num|11:16}} In the [[Septuagint]], the word for Old Testament elders is πρεσβύτερος (presbuteros), as used in the New Testament for both Christian and Jewish leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Nathan|title=Model of Biblical Church Leadership|url=https://www.beyondachurch.com/2018/03/model-of-biblical-church-leadership.html|website=Beyond A Church|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various traditions in Christianity translate the underlying term differently depending on their particular doctrinal or practical view of the role. In the [[Moravian Church]], an elder is referred to as a Helper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moravians.net/joomla/index.php/about-us/34-moravian-moments/71-moravian-moment--8 Moravian Moments #8]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ''presbuteros'', there are two other words used in the [[New Testament]] to describe various aspects of this position of leadership: 'overseer' and 'shepherd': [[Saint Peter|Peter]] draws the three concepts together in one passage: "Therefore, I exhort the ''elders'' among you... ''shepherd'' the flock of God among you, ''exercising oversight''." {{Bibleref2c|1Pet|5:1-2}}&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Acts 20]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

====''Presbuteros''====
''Presbuteros'' (πρεσβύτερος, {{StrongGreek|4245}}) is the most commonly used term for elder in the New Testament, stemming from ''presbus'', elderly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studylight.org/isb/view.cgi?number=4245 Studylight.org, presbuteros]&lt;/ref&gt; It is used with regard to the twelve [[apostles]],{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} the [[seventy disciples]]{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} or others acting in a specific role of authority in a local assembly of Christians. It is used twenty-eight times in the [[Gospels]] and [[Acts]] of the members of the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]] and twelve times in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] of the representatives of the redeemed people of God. The remaining nineteen times the word is employed in Acts and the [[Epistles]], it identifies the leaders in the local churches of the New Testament. While no specific age is given, the connotation of seniority and experience in this term emphasizes the nature of the position and the character of the person, implying maturity, dignity, experience and honor.&lt;ref name="Strauch"&gt;Strauch, A. (1995). ''Biblical Eldership''. Lewis and Roth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gloriouschurch.com/pdf/New-Testament-Elders.pdf Huston, D. The New Testament Elders] Presented to a symposium on Apostolic beliefs held at the Urshan Graduate School of Theology in Florissant, MO&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[modern English]] words "[[priest]]" or "[[presbyter]]" are derived [[etymology|etymologically]] from ''presbyteros''.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', College Edition, The World Publishing Company, Cleveland OH, s.v. "priest"&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament meaning is taken by some scholars as the Latin word [[Legatus|''Legate'']] which describes the ancient classical function as a [[herald]] who represents the highest state office and might be a governor of a province.&lt;ref&gt;Stott, John R. W. (1961). The Preacher's Portrait: Some New Testament Word Studies. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. p. 43. {{ISBN|0-8028-1191-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Episkopos''====
''Episkopos'' (ἐπίσκοπος, {{StrongGreek|1985}}) was a common word in the Greek culture for any official who acted as a superintendent, manager, overseer, controller, curator, guardian or ruler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studylight.org/isb/view.cgi?number=1985 StudyLight.org episkopos]&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs only five times in the New Testament, once referring to [[Christ]]{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|2:25}} and the other four times to church leaders. The [[Authorised Version]] translates the word as "[[bishop]]", emphasizing the function of an elder as exercising authority and supervision "by divine placement, initiative and design."&lt;ref name="Strauch" /&gt; The overseer can sometimes be viewed as a lead elder or as just one of a plurality of elders.

====''Poimen''====
''Poimen'' (ποιμήν, {{StrongGreek|4166}}) means shepherd,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=4166 StudyLight.org poimen]&lt;/ref&gt; also translated as pastor{{Bibleref2c|Eph|4:11}}. It is applied only once in the noun form and three times in the verb form in the New Testament in the context of church leaders. The term emphasizes the elder as one who tends, feeds, guides, protects and cares for his flock.&lt;ref name="Strauch" /&gt;

===Responsibilities of elders===
The [[New Testament]] offers more instruction regarding elders than on many other important church subjects such as the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]], the [[Lord's Day]], [[baptism]] or [[spiritual gifts]],&lt;ref name="Strauch" /&gt; and their duties are laid out in several places. In the majority of the references, the word for elders is plural and word for church is singular,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.org/article/who-should-run-church-case-plurality-elders Wallace, Daniel B. 'Who should run the church? A case for the plurality of elders']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, G.W. 1992 (''A Commentary on the Pastoral Epistles''. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp.175-177&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the pattern in the early church was for a plurality of elders in each local church.&lt;ref name="Dumas"&gt;[http://audio.gracechurch.org/sc/2006notes/The%20Biblical%20Case%20for%20Elder%20Rule,%20Dumas.pdf The Biblical Case for Elder Rule]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Viola, F. and Barna, G. (2008) [https://www.scribd.com/doc/32724382/Pagan-Christianity Pagan Christianity: exploring the roots of our church practices] Carol Stream:Tyndale House&lt;/ref&gt; 
These were to be shepherds to their flock, setting an example{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|5:1-3}} - just like shepherds, they were to feed their flock{{Bibleref2c|Acts|20:28}}, to work hard among them and to reprove where necessary{{Bibleref2c|1Thes|5:12-13}} and to care for the spiritual and physical needs of church members.{{Bibleref2c|Jas|5|14}} Elders are considered rulers over their flocks{{Bibleref2c|1Tim|5:17}}{{Bibleref2c|1Thes|5:12}} and their judgement to be submitted to,{{Bibleref2c|Heb|13:17}} not so that they can be "lords over God's heritage,"{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|5:3}} but because they are to give account to God for the spiritual character of their church.{{Bibleref2c|Heb|13:17}}

Elders must to be able to teach and preach sound [[doctrine]] and rebuke those who are teaching error, so that false teaching doesn't creep into the church.{{Bibleref2c|1Tim|5:17}}{{Bibleref2c|Tit|1:9-13}} To this end, they are also to train and appoint others.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|14:23}}{{Bibleref2c|1Tim|4:14}}{{Bibleref2c|Tit|1:5}} Above all, the elder is to serve with humility, remembering that their position is a picture of [[Christ]] as the chief shepherd.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|5:4}}

===Qualifications===
There are two key passages dealing with the qualifications of elders in the New Testament, {{Bibleref2|1Timothy|3:1-7}} and {{Bibleref2|Titus|1:6-9}}.&lt;ref name="Dumas" /&gt; The qualifications given by the Apostle Paul are as follows:
* Blameless as a [[steward (office)|steward]] of God, above reproach
* Faithful husband to his wife
* Temperate, sober, vigilant
* Sober-minded, prudent
* Of good behaviour, orderly, respectable
* Given to hospitality
* Able to teach
* Not given to wine
* Not violent, not pugnacious
* Patient, moderate, forbearing, gentle
* Uncontentious, not soon angry or quick-tempered
* Not covetous, not a lover of money
* Rules his own house well, his children are faithful, not accused of rebellion to God
* Not a novice or new convert
* Has a good rapport or reputation with outsiders
* Not self-willed
* A lover of what is good
* Just, fair
* Holy, devout
* Self-controlled
* Hold firmly to the faithful message as it has been taught

==Elders in the early church==
Where elders are addressed in the writings of [[Saint Paul|Paul]] and Peter, there is no inference of a [[Episcopal polity|monarchical episcopacy]] or single leaders in any of the New Testament-era churches,{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|5:1-3}}{{Bibleref2c|Phil|1:1}} and ''presbuteros'' and ''episkopos'' are used interchangeably. This was still the case later in the century: the writings of the [[Apostolic Fathers]] (such as [[1 Clement]] and the [[Didache]]) continue to assert the apostolic authority of the bishops/presbyters as rulers of the church making no distinction between the two terms. The epistle does imply a degree of authority residing in the [[Bishop of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Granfield, P. and Phan, P.C., (2000) ''The Gift of the Church: A Textbook On Ecclesiology In Honor Of Patrick Granfield, O.S.B'', (Collegeville: Liturgical Press), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Meyendorff, The Primacy of Peter: Essays in Ecclesiology and the Early Church(St Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1992), p. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; Writing c.199, [[Tertullian]] claimed that Clement was ordained by Peter himself as bishop of Rome,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0311.htm Tertullian, ''Prescription Against Heretics'', 32]&lt;/ref&gt; and although tradition identifies him as the fourth [[pope]] (after [[Pope Linus|Linus]] and [[Pope Anacletus|Anacletus]]) the order is much disputed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04012c.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Pope St Clement I)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Liber Pontificalis]], Linus and Anacletus were ordained with responsibility for the church at Rome and Clement for the church as a whole&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/liberpontificalis1.html Liber Pontificalis 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of the [[Apostolic Fathers]], [[Ignatius of Antioch]], records that many churches had single bishops by the beginning of the second century, although the church at Rome was not one of them.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman, Bart. Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History and Legend. Oxford University Press, USA. 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-530013-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became the norm by the middle of the century.&lt;ref&gt;"Bishop". Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ignatius distinguished the relationship between [[bishop]], [[presbyters]] and [[diaconate]] [[typology (theology)|typologically]] and in doing so referred to the practice of a single bishop in a church, separated from the body of presbyters and deacons:

''In like manner let all men respect the deacons as Jesus Christ, even as they should respect the bishop as being a type of the Father and the presbyters as the council of God and as the college of Apostles. Apart from these there is not even the name of a church.'' — [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallesians]] 3:1.

==Distinctions in practice==

[[Ecclesiastical polity|Church governance]] is generally organised in one of three main types:
* [[Episcopal polity]], in which churches are governed in a hierarchical fashion, with the role of elders being fulfilled by external bishops. It is common in [[Anglican]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]], [[Methodist]], [[Lutheran]] and [[Roman Catholic]] churches, and was prevalent up to and after the [[Reformation]].
* [[Presbyterian polity]], in which churches are governed on a denominational, geographical basis by committees of elders.
* [[Congregational polity]], in which each church is responsible for its own governance. Churches employing this method include [[Baptist]], [[Congregational church|Congregational]] and [[Plymouth Brethren]] churches. Some churches are led by a [[pastor]]; some maintain a [[plurality (church governance)|plurality]] of elders.

===Baptists===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Baptist]] --&gt;
Historically, [[Baptist]] churches do not recognize elder as a separate office from those of pastor or deacon; it is commonly considered a synonym of deacon or pastor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baptist.org.uk/resources/resource_downloads/493.pdf Fiddes, P. ''A Leading Question''] London: Baptist Publications&lt;/ref&gt; This is not universal in Baptist circles, however, and there are many Baptist churches which are elder-led. The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] does not prescribe an elder-led pattern, although a number of churches in this convention,&lt;ref name="Dumas" /&gt; and other Baptist branches (including [[Reformed Baptists]]) are governed by a group of elders. The functional term 'presbytery' has been utilized among Southern Baptists to denote their ordination council.&lt;ref&gt;McMinn, J.B. (1958). "Elder". In Encyclopedia of Southern Baptists. 1. Nashville, Tenn: Broadman Press. pp. 396-397.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christadelphianism===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
[[Christadelphians]] do not appoint any form of clergy. Organisation is based on ecclesially accountable committees for [[evangelism]], youth and [[Sunday School]] work, [[military service]] issues, care of the elderly and humanitarian work. These do not have any legislative authority and are wholly dependent upon support from within the church. Women are typically not eligible to teach in formal gatherings of the [[wikt:congregation|ecclesia]] when male believers are present, and do not sit on the main committees, however they do participate in other ecclesial and inter-ecclesial committees.

===Churches of Christ===
{{main|Churches of Christ#Congregational autonomy and leadership}}
Congregations referring to themselves as [[Churches of Christ]] believe that local congregations should be led by a plurality of biblically qualified elders.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Rhodes, The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations, Harvest House Publishers, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7369-1289-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard, V.E. (1971) ''What Is the Church of Christ?'' 4th Edition (Revised) Central Printers &amp; Publishers, West Monroe, Louisiana&lt;/ref&gt;  They base this on a conviction that congregations (and Christians in general) should attempt to follow the teachings of the [[New Testament]] wherever humanly possible.&lt;ref&gt;This belief is shared with other religious organizations with roots in the [[Restoration Movement]], such as the [[Independent Christian Church]].
&lt;/ref&gt;  In accordance with the teachings of the bible the Churches of Christ teach and practice that only males may serve as elders (female elders are not recognized), and must meet Biblical qualifications (generally I Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:5-9 are the Biblical texts used to determine if a male is qualified to serve as elder).

In this regard, elders are accountable to each other and to God. The evangelist and the elders have the spiritual oversight of the congregation (e.g., withdrawing fellowship from a member who the elders consider to be wayward in doctrine or refuses to abide by the elders' counsel or decision in a matter) as well as administrative oversight (e.g., overseeing the congregation budget).

The elders will be assisted by [[deacons]] who, depending on the congregation, may have a specific area of non-spiritual service (e.g., finance, building and grounds, benevolence); the deacons are in all matters subservient to the elders. An elder may also be qualified to serve as a deacon (and, in some cases, may have previously served as a deacon before becoming an elder).

Depending on the congregation, the elders may rotate main preaching and teaching duties or appoint one or more male persons (who may or may not be elders) to serve as the [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]s for that congregation. If one person is assigned main preaching duties, he is never referred to as "Father" (based on Matthew 23:9, which states that the only Father a Christian has is in Heaven), nor is the individual referred to as "pastor" (due to belief that the one reference to "pastor" in Ephesians 4:11 is translated "shepherd" in all other cases, and in context either refers to Jesus Christ or to an elder; as stated above the person with main preaching duties may or may not be an elder) or "reverend" (due to belief that the one reference to this term in Psalm 111:9 refers to the reverence of God's name).  Instead, common terms used are "evangelist", "preacher", "minister" (or "pulpit minister"; the latter may be used if the congregation has assistant or associate ministers over certain programs or functions), or "preaching elder" (if the person is also an elder).

===Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
{{main|Elder (Latter Day Saints)}}
''Elders'' are members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] who have the [[Melchizedek Priesthood]] and have been ordained to the office of elder. Additionally, male [[Missionary#Latter-day Saint missionaries|missionaries]] of the Church, [[General Authority|General Authorities]] and [[Seventy (LDS Church)#Third.2C Fourth.2C Fifth.2C Sixth.2C Seventh.2C and Eighth Quorums of the Seventy|Area Authority Seventies]] are honorarily titled "Elder" unless they are instead referred to by the title of ''President.''

The detailed duties of the ordained elders in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today have been defined in the book of [[Doctrine and Covenants]].
Elder is the proper title given to all holders of the Melchizedek Priesthood. Thus an apostle is an elder in this sense, and it is proper to speak of members of the Quorum of the Twelve or the First Quorum of the Seventy by this title.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] (D&amp;C) 20: 38; cf. 1 Pet. 5: 1; 2 Jn. 1: 1; 3 Jn. 1: 1&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}.

===Church of Scotland===
{{main|Ministers and elders in the Church of Scotland}}
Governance in the [[Church of Scotland]] is based on [[presbyterian polity]]. There are several roles in the ministry including [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] of Word and Sacrament, [[chaplains]], [[deacons]] and readers. Elders are another role, which is voluntary and un-salaried elders. They are ordained for life by the minister and [[Kirk Session]] of a [[parish]], and carry out [[pastoral]] and local church government duties under the guidance of the [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]. All elders are members of the Kirk session, and may train to chair the session, conduct funerals, preach and lead worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/ministry/ministryroles.htm Church of Scotland website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congregational churches===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
{{main|Congregational church}}
[[Congregational church]]es are generally run by committee rule, and elders are one office which is appointed by the committee. The governance of each church is arranged with a system of checks and balances so that undue power is never given to one office or individual.

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
{{main|Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Elders}}
Among [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], an [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Elders|elder]] is a man appointed to teach the congregation. He is also called an "overseer" or "servant". Elders within each congregation work within a "body of elders", several of whom are assigned to oversee specific congregational tasks. Each body of elders has a Coordinator (previously known as the Presiding Overseer), a Secretary, and a Service Overseer. Witnesses consider the office of elder to be the same as that referred to in the Bible as "older man" ("[[presbyter]]"), overseer ("[[bishop]]"), and shepherd ("[[pastor]]") but do not use any of the terms as [[title]]s.

Representatives of the [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses]] select elders to be appointed as [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Circuit|circuit overseer]]s, (also referred to as traveling overseers). Each circuit overseer visits the [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Congregations|congregation]]s in his jurisdiction twice each year. During his visit, local elders recommend members who may qualify for appointment as elders or [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Ministerial servants|ministerial servants]] (equivalent to [[deacon]]s), and appointments are decided by the circuit overseer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/w20141115/questions-from-readers/ "Questions From Readers", ''The Watch Tower'', pages 28,29]&lt;/ref&gt; Congregation elders do not receive monetary compensation; traveling overseers receive a modest stipend.

===Lutheranism===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
An Elder in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] is a position of lay-service, concerned with the temporal and administrative affair of the congregation. In many congregations, elders are also charged with oversight of the pastor but exercising only that oversight given to every Christian in the congregation. They are also assigned to assist the pastor in the [[Lutheran sacraments|sacraments]] (the [[Eucharist in the Lutheran Church|Eucharist]] and [[Baptism]]). In the Eucharist, the Elder may assist in the distribution. In Baptism, the Elder may hold the [[Holy water|water]] or assist the pastor in other ways. Generally, an elder is not permitted to [[Consecration|consecrate]] the bread and wine in the Eucharist, or perform [[Holy Absolution]], as these acts are usually reserved for the pastor. An Elder helps brothers at each congregation.

However, many within the confessional wing of Lutheranism, see the term "elder" being used in such a way an unfortunate effect of Reformed (and broader Protestant) influence on the Lutheran Church. Elder (or Presbyteros, in the Greek) serving as a synonym for "Pastor" or "Priest", not unlike how Lutheran teaching also recognizes "episkopos" (Greek, meaning overseer), or bishop to be yet another synonym. Historic Lutheranism recognized a single office of Word and Sacrament being established directly by Christ (technically two, counting the uniquely Lutheran vocation of laity); all distinctions within nomenclature and structural ranking were purely "jure humano" (of human make). Thus making a distinction between "pastor" and "elder" would seem pointless, and using the term "lay elder" would be oxymoronic.

===Methodism===
{{main|Elder (Methodism)}}
An ''Elder'' - sometimes called a "Presbyter" - is someone who has been [[ordained]] by a [[bishop]] to the ministry of Word, [[Sacrament]], Order, and Service. Their responsibilities are to preach and teach, preside at the celebration of the sacraments, administer the church through pastoral guidance, and lead the congregations under their care in service ministry to the world.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church]]''. Nashville: The United Methodist Publishing House, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The office of ''Elder'', then, is what most people tend to think of as the [[pastor]]al, [[priest]]ly, [[clergy]] office within the church. Indeed, even a Methodist [[Bishop]] is still an Elder who has been elected and consecrated by the laying on of hands to the '''office''' of Bishop (Bishop being understood as an ''office'' within the Presbyterate, '''not''' an ''order'' or separate level of ordination). In some of the denominations within [[Methodism]], [[ordination]] to the office of ''Elder'' is open to both women and men, while in others, such as the [[Primitive Methodist Church]] and [[Evangelical Wesleyan Church]], it is only opened to men.&lt;ref name="EWC2015"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Evangelical Wesleyan Church |year=2015|publisher=[[Evangelical Wesleyan Church]]|language=English|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMC2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivemethodistchurch.org/Discipline-2013.pdf|title=Discipline of the Primitive Methodist Church in the United States of America|publisher=[[Primitive Methodist Church]]|language=English|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plymouth Brethren===
{{main|Plymouth Brethren#No clergy}}
One of the key distinctions of [[Plymouth Brethren]] churches is the total rejection of the concept of [[clergy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preciousseed.org/view.php?id=2038&amp;highlight_word=elders Holmes, F. (1962) Regarding Elders. ''Precious Seed'', 13(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the doctrine of the [[priesthood of all believers]], they view all Christians as being ordained by God to serve and therefore ministers. Leaders are chosen according to the qualifications found in {{Bibleref2|1Tim|3:1-7}} and {{Bibleref2|Tit.|1:6-9}}, and appointed by the Holy Spirit.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|20:28}} Plymouth Brethren churches tend to have multiple elders based on the plural use of the word in reference to New Testament churches.

One branch of the Plymouth Brethren, the [[Exclusive Brethren]], are so named for their practice of serving the Lord's Supper exclusively to those who are part of their own particular group, agreeing with them on various doctrinal positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/exclusivebrethren_1.shtml BBC website]&lt;/ref&gt; Most Exclusive Brethren groups believe the church to have been in ruins between the death of the apostles and their own time. Since no truly apostolic authority exists to appoint elders the church has none. Instead they recognize "leading brothers" who demonstrate maturity and leadership ability.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Presbyterianism===
{{main|Presbyterian polity#Elder}}
Although practices in the [[Presbyterian Church]] vary internationally, typically the church recognises three offices within church polity: the [[Presbyterian polity#Minister|minister]] (alternately "teaching elder" or "pastor"), a bench of ruling elders, and [[deacons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpc.org/resources/books/miller/elder01.html/ Miller, Samuel. 1831. ''An Essay, on the Warrant, Nature and Duties of the Office of the Ruling Elder, in the Presbyterian Church'' (New York: Jonathan Leavitt; Boston: Crocker and Brewster, 1831). Chapter 1 retrieved on November 29, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The elders are "ordained lay" people and form the [[Kirk Session|session]], which is a ruling council for their congregation.

===Rastafari===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
Members of the [[Rastafari Movement]] often refer to their experienced members as elders, such as [[Joseph Hibbert]], [[Vernon Carrington]], [[Leonard Howell]], and [[Mortimer Planno]].

===Roman Catholic Church===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
Members of the [[Catholic Church]] still use the Greek word [[Presbyter]] (πρεσβύτερος, presbuteros: "elder", or "priest" in Christian usage) to refer to priests (priest is etymologically derived from the Greek presbyteros via the Latin presbyter). Collectively, however, their "college" is referred to as the "presbyterium" (meaning "council of elders"), "presbytery", or "presbyterate."

The [[presbyterium]] is most visible during the ordination of new priests and bishops and the [[Mass of the Chrism]] (the Holy Thursday Mass) where the blessing of the oils used in the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, Anointing of the Sick, and Holy Orders takes place. They are also visible during other special liturgical functions such as the wake and burial of their bishop.

===Seventh-day Adventist Church===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
In each local church, the Pastor works with a ''local elder'', who is appointed by the local congregation and ordained by the pastor. The elder is considered a religious leader in the local church and is able to conduct {{clarify span|text=ordinances|date=December 2014}} such as baptism. In some cases more than one elder is appointed, with one designated the "head elder". The elder is largely responsible for running the church and allocating responsibilities therein. Whereas "pastor" is often used as a title, "elder" is not. The local elder's authority is limited to the church in which he serves, whereas pastors have wider authority.

"Elder" is also used as a title used to denote ordained clergy. Those who are unordained clergy are often and universally addressed as "pastor". If one is ordained and remains in the local church, they are often titled interchangeably  as 'Pastor or Elder'. Once ordained clergy leave the local church and begin their service within the Adventist Church's organizational leadership, e.g. Conference/Union/Division/General Conference offices as departmental directors, etc., they are universally addressed as "Elder", as in the case of the current (World Church) President of the General Conference, "Elder Ted Wilson".

===Shakerism===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
Among the [[Shakers]], noted for their acceptance of females in leading roles, Elders and Eldresses were leaders in specific areas. Two Elders and Eldresses headed the central Shaker ministry at the [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Society]] and dealt with both spiritual and temporal matters. Other pairs of elders and eldresses headed groups of Shaker communities, while others were spiritual leaders of smaller groups within the communities.

Born in 1946 in the United States, Cowan was raised in Chicago, Winnipeg and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granitepublishing.us/dox/PSM/Cowan.bio.pdf Biography at Granite Publishing (PDF)] Retrieved 5/6/2011&lt;/ref&gt; He received a degree in Anthropology from [[Pomona College]] and pursued post-graduate study in documentary filmmaking at [[UCLA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granitepublishing.us/dox/PSM/Cowan.bio.pdf Biography at Granite Publishing (PDF)], Retrieved 5/6/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UOkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=%22eliot+cowan%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AlXETfaaGajl0QGKqJWOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22eliot%20cowan%22&amp;f=false Plant Spirit Medicine by Holly Hammond] Yoga Journal December 1996 (Issue 131) p.79 at Google Books, Retrieved 5/6/2011&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1970, while living on a farm in [[Vermont]], he became distraught because one of his goats was sick. Unwilling to accept a "hopeless" diagnosis from a veterinarian, he began to read about herbalism and treated the goat with a plant. The goat healed, and Cowan's work in Herbalism began. In 1971, he traveled to England to study [[acupuncture]], receiving Licentiate, Bachelor and Master of Acupuncture degrees from J.R. Worsley at the College of Traditional Acupuncture, [[Leamington Spa]], England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluedeer.org/teachers/eliot-cowan Blue Deer Center biography] 2011, Retrieved 5/14/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granitepublishing.us/dox/PSM/Cowan.bio.pdf Biography at Granite Publishing (PDF)] Retrieved 5/6/2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a number of years practicing acupuncture, he came across an article on the [[Huichol Indians]] of the Mexican Sierras. The article caused him to travel to Mexico and meet them. A series of dreams, encounters and experiences guided him to apprentice with Don Guadalupe Gonzalez Rios, an eminent Huichol shaman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granitepublishing.us/dox/PSM/Cowan.bio.pdf Biography at Granite Publishing (PDF)] Retrieved 5/6/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UOkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=%22eliot+cowan%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AlXETfaaGajl0QGKqJWOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22eliot%20cowan%22&amp;f=false Plant Spirit Medicine by Holly Hammond] Yoga Journal December 1996 (Issue 131) p.79 at Google Books, Retrieved 5/6/2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 2000, Cowan was ritually recognized by Don Guadalupe as a guide to shamanic apprentices in the Huichol tradition. As of 2011, twenty-five of Eliot Cowan's apprentices have gone on to become shamans in the Huichol tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granitepublishing.us/dox/PSM/Cowan.bio.pdf Biography at Granite Publishing (PDF)] Retrieved 5/6/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to teaching, lecturing, healing and training of shamanic apprentices on the Huichol path, one of Cowan's most significant contributions is his synthesis of [[shamanism]], [[traditional Chinese Medicine]] and [[Herbalism]] into the healing technique known as Plant Spirit Medicine. Cowan is Founder and Board Chair of the Blue Deer Center in the New York [[Catskills]], and is Elder Emeritus of the Plant Spirit Medicine Seminary. In that capacity he offers healer training courses on Plant Spirit Medicine, healing camps based on traditional Huichol healing, and animal [[totem]] courses in the United States and internationally.

'''''Everson v. Board of Education''''', 330 U.S. 1 (1947),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Everson v. Board of Education|330|1|1947}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[landmark case|landmark decision]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] which applied the [[Establishment Clause]] in the country's [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] to [[State law]]. Prior to this decision, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s words, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion"&lt;ref&gt;in the [[s:United States Bill of Rights|United States Bill of Rights]]&lt;/ref&gt; imposed limits only on the federal government, while many states continued to grant certain religious denominations [[legislature|legislative]] or [[de facto|effective]] privileges.&lt;ref name=schultz78&gt;{{harvnb|Schultz|1999|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first Supreme Court case [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporating]] the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment as binding upon the states through the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The decision in ''Everson''  marked a turning point in the interpretation and application of disestablishment law in the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Witte|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was brought by a [[New Jersey]] taxpayer against a tax-funded [[school district]] that provided reimbursement to parents of both public and private schooled people taking the public transportation system to school. The taxpayer contended reimbursement given for children attending private religious schools violated the [[constitutionality|constitutional]] prohibition against state support of religion, and the use of taxpayer funds to do so violated the Due Process Clause.  The Justices were split over the question whether the New Jersey policy constituted support of religion, with the majority concluding these reimbursements were "separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function" that they did not violate the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1949/1946/1946_52/ "Everson v. Board of Education: Conclusion", OYEZ U. S. Supreme Court Media"], 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Both affirming and dissenting Justices, however, were decisive that the Constitution required a sharp separation between government and religion and their strongly worded opinions paved the way to a series of later court decisions that taken together brought about profound changes in legislation, public education, and other policies involving matters of religion.&lt;ref name=schultz78/&gt; Both Justice [[Hugo Black]]'s majority opinion and Justice [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Wiley Rutledge]]'s [[dissenting opinion|dissent]] defined the First Amendment religious clause in terms of a "wall of separation between church and state".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schultz|1999|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See

==Background==
After repealing a former ban, a [[New Jersey]] law authorized payment by local school boards of the costs of transportation to and from schools &amp;ndash; including private schools. Of the private schools that benefited from this policy, 96% were parochial [[Catholic school]]s. Arch R. Everson, a taxpayer in [[Ewing Township, New Jersey|Ewing Township]], filed a lawsuit alleging that this indirect aid to religion through the mechanism of reimbursing parents and students for costs incurred as a result of attending religious schools violated both the [[New Jersey state constitution]] and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. After a loss in the [[New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals]], then the state's highest court, Everson appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on purely federal constitutional grounds.

==Opinions==
The 5-4 decision was handed down on February 10, 1947, and was based upon the writing of [[James Madison]] (''[[Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments]]'') and Thomas Jefferson ([[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Everson v. Board of Education of Ewing Tp |vol=330 |reporter= |opinion=1 |pinpoint= |court=Supreme Court |date=1947 |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=330&amp;invol=1 |accessdate=2015-01-13 |quote=}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal |last=Munoz |first=Vincent Phillip |last2= |first2= |date= |title=The Original Meaning of the Establishment Clause and the Impossibility of its Incorporation |url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1280&amp;context=jcl |journal=Journal of Constitutional Law |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=588–590 |doi= |accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court, through Justice Hugo Black, ruled that the state bill was constitutionally permissible because the reimbursements were offered to all students regardless of religion and because the payments were made to parents and not any religious institution. Perhaps as important as the actual outcome, though, was the interpretation given by the entire Court to the Establishment Clause. It reflected a broad interpretation of the Clause that was to guide the Court's decisions for decades to come. Black's language was sweeping:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 'establishment of religion' clause of the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance. No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups and vice versa. In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect 'a wall of separation between Church and State.' 330 U.S. 1, 15-16.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice Jackson wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice Frankfurter.  Justice Rutledge wrote another dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justices Frankfurter, Jackson and Burton.  The four dissenters agreed with Justice Black's definition of the Establishment Clause, but protested that the principles he laid down ought logically to lead to the invalidation of the challenged law.

In his written dissent, Justice Wiley Rutledge argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The funds used here were raised by taxation. The Court does not dispute nor could it that their use does in fact give aid and encouragement to religious instruction. It only concludes that this aid is not 'support' in law. But Madison and Jefferson were concerned with aid and support in fact not as a legal conclusion 'entangled in precedents.' Here parents pay money to send their children to parochial schools and funds raised by taxation are used to reimburse them. This not only helps the children to get to school and the parents to send them. It aids them in a substantial way to get the very thing which they are sent to the particular school to secure, namely, religious training and teaching. 330 U.S. 1, 45.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Impact==
In its first hundred years, the United States Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution's Bill of Rights as a limit on federal government and considered the states bound only by those rights granted to its citizens by their own state constitutions. Because the federal laws during this period were remote influences at most on the personal affairs of its citizens, minimal attention was paid by the Court to how those provisions in the federal Bill of Rights were to be interpreted.

Following the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth]] to [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]s to the Constitution at the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the Supreme Court would hear hundreds of cases involving conflicts over the [[constitutionality]] of laws passed by the states.  The decisions in these cases were often criticized as resulting more from the biases of the individual Justices than the applicable rule of law or constitutional duty to protect individual rights. But, by the 1930s, the Court began consistently reasoning that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed citizens First Amendment protections from even state and local governments, a process known as [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McWhirter|1994|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1940 decision in ''[[Cantwell v. Connecticut]]'' was the first Supreme Court decision to apply the First Amendment's religious protections to the states, that case focusing on the so-called [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|Free Exercise Clause]]. The decision ''Everson'' followed in 1947, the first incorporating the [[Establishment Clause]].&lt;ref name=larson&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward John |edition=3, revised |title=Trial and error: the American controversy over creation and evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press US |isbn=9780195154702 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous state cases followed disentangling the church from public schools, most notably the 1951 New Mexico case of ''[[Zellers v. Huff]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeffer, Leo (1967) ''Church, state, and freedom'' Beacon Press, Boston, Massachusetts, pages 545-549&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, Curtis Daniel (1952) ''Understanding public opinion: A guide for newspapermen and newspaper readers'' Macmillan, New York, page 532&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holscher, Kathleen A. (2008) ''Habits in the classroom: A court case regarding Catholic sisters in New Mexico '' Doctoral Dissertation, Department of Religion, Princeton University, page ''iii'', [https://www.scribd.com/doc/19156923/Habits-in-the-classroom-A-court-case-regarding-Catholic-sisters-in-New-Mexico Abstract and Introduction] from Scribd&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar First Amendment cases have flooded the courts in the decades following ''Everson''.  Having invoked Thomas Jefferson's metaphor of the [[separation of church and state|wall of separation]] in the ''Everson'' decision, the lawmakers and courts have struggled how to balance governments' dual duty to satisfy both the nonestablishment clause and the free exercise clause contained in the language of the amendment. The majority and dissenting Justices in ''Everson'' split over this very question, with Rutledge in the minority by insisting that the Constitution forbids "every form of public aid or support for religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McWhirter|1994|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3175">The Belarusian chapter of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|General Jewish Labour Bund]] was among political parties forming the government and parliament of the [[Belarusian People's Republic]] gaining independence in 1918.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

Members of the Bund became members of the Parliament. Bund member [[Mojżesz Gutman]] even became a [[Minister without portfolio]] in the Government of the newly created republic and drafted its constitution.{{fact|date=April 2014}} The Bund left later the government bodies of the BNR.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Contrarily to the attitude of the Communist party in [[Communist Bund (Ukraine)|Ukraine]] and [[Communist Bund (Russia)|Russia]] proper, the [[Communist Party (bolsheviks) of Lithuania and Belorussia]] agreed to integrate in its ranks the local Bund, renamed Belarusian Kombund in April 1920 after the Twelfth Conference of the Bund on April 12–19, 1920 in [[Gomel]], into an autonomous Jewish Communist Party, thus not forcing individual members either to join directly the party or through the [[Yevsektsiya]]. They even demanded the Yevsektsiya to be dissolved into the Kombund. This seems however to have been a mere agreement on paper that was never implemented, a manoeuver by the Communists to attract support from Bundists as the Bund was more powerful than them in the Belarusian cities.&lt;ref name="levin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Nora|title=The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917: Paradox of Survival|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|year=1990|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Nz0N5GBW6MC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=2009-11-10 | isbn=978-0-8147-5051-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, at its Thirteenth Conference of the still "General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia", i.e. then in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, a majority of the Bundist delegates decided to dissolve the party, and part of its membership joined the R.C.P.(B.) on the basis of the rules of admission,&lt;ref name="lenin1920"&gt;explanatory note to {{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/apr/18.htm|title=To Members of the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)|last= Lenin|first=Vladimir I.|date=April 19 – May 6, 1920 |work=Marxists Internet Archive|publisher=Lenin Internet Archive (2003)|accessdate=2009-11-10}}, from documents archived at the Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.TJ.&lt;/ref&gt; while the minority formed the [[Social Democratic Bund]].

In [[West Belarus]], that was part of interwar [[Poland]], the remnants of the party finally merged into the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Polish Bund]], while many activists chose to join the [[Communist Party of Poland|Polish Communist Party]].

{{Hinduism by country}}
The earliest evidence of '''Hinduism in Tanzania''' is from the 1st millennium AD when there was trade between East Africa and Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=cjjr&gt;Constance Jones and James D. Ryan, Encyclopedia of Hinduism, {{ISBN|978-0816073368}}, pp. 10-12&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these traders came from Gujarat, Deccan (now Maharashtra) and Tamil Chola empire. Archaeological evidence of small Hindu settlements have been found in [[Zanzibar]] and parts of [[Swahili coast]], Zimbabwe and Madagascar.&lt;ref name=cjjr/&gt;

Pew Research Center estimates there were about 50,000 Hindus in Tanzania in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/table-religious-composition-by-country-in-numbers/ Table: Religious Composition by Country, in Numbers] Pew Research Center (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A mention of ancient trade between Hindus of India and Africa is from the time of [[Nabonidus]], when Babylon was one of the hubs of global trade.&lt;ref name=whi&gt;W.H. Ingrams (1967), Zanzibar: Its History and Its People, {{ISBN|978-0714611020}}, Routledge, pp. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient times, the Hindus would trade, never interfere in political system and return to India. Small settlements of Hindus began in 1st century AD, mostly on islands east of Africa, along its coast and in few cases inland. Ancient Indian texts refer to ''Wanyamwezi'', or "the men of the moon" - a term still in use to identify the [[Nyamwezi people]] in Tanzania.&lt;ref name=whi/&gt; Every major explorer who visited eastern side of Africa has mentioned the presence of Hindu traders and merchants, in Zanzibar, Kilwa, Mombasa, Malindi and Mozambique. Vasco da Gama won over and convinced one such Africa-settled Gujarati Hindu to help pilot his maiden voyage from Africa to India.&lt;ref name=whi/&gt; This affinity and regular trade was helped by steady trade winds that flow from east Africa to Indian peninsula for part of the year, while reverse and flow from Indian peninsula to east Africa for another part of the year.&lt;ref&gt;K.N. Chaudhuri (1985), Trade and Civilisation in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the rise of Islam to 1750, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521285421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindus were known to be vegetarians and non-violent, never imposing their religion or culture in Africa. They prospered by offering a good trade, quality products and cash loans to the Zanzibar and other African community, but have traditionally kept their religion, social and cultural life as a private, personal matter.&lt;ref name=whi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prabha Bhardwaj, [http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3571 Hindus Stand Strong In Ancient Tanzania] Hinduism Today (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; The first major change came to Tanzania with the arrival of Shia Islam (Ismaili), when Muslims and Omani Arabs began to compete with Indian Hindus, and when Muslims began a campaign of conversion. The second major change came with in 16th century with the arrival of colonial empires and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Markovits (2008), The Global World of Indian Merchants, 1750–1947: Traders of Sind from Bukhara to Panama, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521089401}}, pp. 10-79&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial era, after European officials,&lt;ref&gt;Both during the German colonial empire before World War I, as well the British colonial rule of Tanzania after World War I&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus were the most economically successful ethnic group in Tanzania, but they remained politically and legally insecure as a minority.&lt;ref&gt;G. Oonk (2006), South Asians in East Africa (1880-1920) with a Particular Focus on Zanzibar: Toward a Historical Explanation of Economic Success of a Middlemen Minority, African and Asian Studies, Volume 5, Issue 1, pages 57 – 90&lt;/ref&gt; When British colonial era ended, Indian Hindus became a targeted, persecuted group and many emigrated from Tanzania to Europe and India.&lt;ref&gt;A. Keshodkar (2010), Marriage as the Means to Preserve ‘Asian-ness’: The Post-Revolutionary Experience of the Asians of Zanzibar, Journal of Asian and African Studies, 45(2), pp. 226-240&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism]] is a minority religion in [[Tanzania]], practiced by some 30,000 people (1996) in the mainland and [[Zanzibar]] combined. Most practitioners are of Indo-Tanzanian (particularly [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]) ancestry.

There were about 50,000 Hindus in Tanzania in 2010, according to Pew Research Center estimates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/table-religious-composition-by-country-in-numbers/ Table: Religious Composition by Country, in Numbers] Pew Research Center (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the various traditions within Hinduism, Swaminarayan from Gujarat is an active [[bhakti]] school of Hinduism in Tanzania and Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Brady Williams (1984), A New Face of Hinduism: The Swaminarayan Religion, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521274739}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was well established by 1950, because of its social, cultural and temple building initiatives in East Africa. Hindu temples have been established in Dar-es-Salaam, most of them located at the City Centre, the street name where the Hindu temples are located has been renamed to [[Pramukh Swami]] street. [[Swaminarayan temples]] have also been built in cities other than [[Dar-es-Salaam]], such as [[Zanzibar]], [[Arusha]] and [[Moshi, Kilimanjaro|Moshi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Hindu temples outside India#Tanzania]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other Hindu schools with presence in Tanzania include [[Yoga]] and [[Vedanta]].

Followers of [[Brahma Kumari]], [[Satya Sai Baba]] and [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] also have a presence amongst the Hindus in Tanzania.

[[Diwali|Dipawali]] and other Hindu festivals are observed by the Hindus of Tanzania.

'''Islamic Scholarship &amp; Learning in Central Asia during Abbasid Period'''

The [[educational institution]]s in [[Central Asia]] were graded and comprised [[elementary school]]s during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Period]]. The [[educational system]] was further enlarged and elaborated. Elementary schools for senior students and institutions for advanced students. The formal education of the children usually begins at the age of six when they were admitted to elementary schools. The elementary schools were generally attached to the [[mosque]]s. At the elementary stage boys and girls read tighter. The curricula for the elementary schools included reading, writing, [[grammar]], traditions and arithmetic. After completing education in the mosque school, a student could seek admission to an educational institution meant for senior students. The syllabus of studies at such institutions included [[theology]], [[jurisprudence]], [[lexicography]], and [[literature]]. In the institutions for advanced studies the curricula included [[astronomy]], [[geometry]], [[philosophy]], [[music]], [[medicine]], and other studies. The Abbasid Caliph, [[Al-Ma'mun]], set up an academy known as Bait ul Hikma which served as an institution of higher learning. Under the [[Seljuks]], Minister [[Nizam-al-Mulk]] set up a [[University]] at [[Baghdad]] known as [[Nizamiyya|Nizamiyah]]. It was residential institution and scholars like [[Al-Ghazali|Imam Ghazali]] taught at this university. Later the Abbasid Caliph Mutansir set up another University at Bagdad known as the [[Mustansiriya University|Mustansiriyah]]. Numerous colleges were set up in various parts of the country. Some of the colleges in Khurasan and Persia were: Sadiyya, Bahaqiyya, Astrabadiyya, and Isfaranayya. One of the [[carving]]s on the Portals of these universities was that the world supported by four things: learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the religious and the valour of the brave.

As an adjunct to the process of [[education]], the Muslims set up [[Library|libraries]]. There were libraries attached to all educational institution. The Nizamiah university had four lakh books. The library at Ray had for hundred camel loads of books.
[[Bukhara]] was one of the leading centres of learning, culture, and art in the Muslim world. Some of the greatest historians, scientists, and geographers in the history of [[Islamic culture]] were natives of the Central Asia who came to be known for their work during Abbasid rule in central Asia.

Furthermore, scientists who were citizens of the [[Khilafah]] such as al-Khorezmi, Beruni, Farabi, Abu Ali ibn Sina brought fame to the area all over the world, generating respect across the world, and many scientific achievements of the period made a great impact on the European science. [[Al-Biruni]] (from Central Asia, 10th–11th centuries) is best known for his work of history, Chronology of Ancient Nations. He also wrote treatises on [[astronomy]], [[geography]], [[mathematics]], and [[pharmacology]].

Jabir Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) developed an early scientific method in his Book of Optics (1021). The most important development of the [[scientific method]] was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally empirical orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. Ibn al-Haytham is also regarded as the father of [[optics]], especially for his empirical proof of the [[intromission theory]] of light.

[[Algebra]] was also pioneered by Persian Scientist Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī during this time in his landmark text, Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabala, from which the term algebra is derived. He is thus considered to be the father of algebra. The terms [[algorism]] and [[algorithm]] are also derived from the name of al-Khwarizmi, who was responsible for introducing the [[Arabic numeral]]s and Hindu-Arabic numeral system beyond the Indian Subcontinent.

Medicine was advanced particularly during the Abbasids' reign in Central Asia. During the ninth century, Baghdad contained over 800 doctors, and great discoveries in the understanding of [[anatomy]] and [[disease]]s were made. The clinical distinction between [[measles]] and [[smallpox]] was discovered during this time in Central Asia. Famous Persian scientist Ibn Sina produced thesis and works that summarized the vast amount of knowledge that scientists had accumulated, and is often known as the father of modern medicine for his [[encyclopaedia]]s, The Canan of Medicine and the Book of Healing. Some of his great works are: “Kitab Shifa al Nafs” (The book the healing of the soul); “Kitab al Najat al Nafs” (the book of the salvation of the soul); “Kitab al Isharat wal Tanbhihat” (The book of the hints and the Warnings).

Towards the end of 9th century, in Samarkand Al-Maturidi, a contemporary of Al Ash’ari established a school of Rational Theology or Kalam, which sought to effect a compromise between [[orthodoxy]] and Mutazilism.

In the 10th Century Abu Nasr Muhammad Al Farabi produced a book Aara Ahl al Madinah al Fadila. (the Opinins of the Virtuous City), and Al Siyasat al Madaniyya (Political Regimes’) he produced the concept of “Virtuous City” and “First Chief”.

Imam al Ghazali produced his classical work Ihya Ulum ul Din towards the end of 11th century.

Abul Barkat Al Baghdadi was an eminent [[philosopher]] of the twelfth century. His principal book is Kitab ul Mutahar (The Book of that which has been established by personal reflections). He held that the space is three-dimensional and infinite. He defined time as the measure of being. He held that there is no distinction between intellect and soul.

During [[Middle Ages]] the Muslims were the most advanced people in the world. While in Europe even the kings could not read and write, in the Muslim countries even the common man could read and write. According to Imam Abu Hanifah, the eminent [[jurist]], the purpose of education in Islam is the acquisition of [[Taqwa]]. Taqwa means the right conduct.

“Education means the understanding of what makes or mars a soul, the acquisition of power and the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong, between good and bad in regard to this and the next world, and the acquisition of the right and proper capacity to choose the right conduct to that the misguided intellect of man may not lead him astray.” Indeed, no purpose of education could be nobler than that.

The '''Jewish Telegraphic Agency''' ('''JTA''') is an international [[news agency]] and [[wire service]] serving Jewish community [[newspaper]]s and media around the world, with about 70 syndication clients listed on its web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=https://www.jta.org/about-us|website=Jewish Telegraph Agency|publisher=Jewish Telegraph Agency|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The JTA was founded on February 6, 1917, by Jacob Landau as the Jewish Correspondence Bureau in [[The Hague]] with the mandate of collecting and disseminating news affecting the Jewish communities around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A808AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA182 |title=American Jewish year book |publisher= |year=1920 |author=American Jewish Committee, Jewish Publication Society of America |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCiwUyWDBu4C&amp;pg=PA91 |title=Religion and our divided denominations |publisher= |year=1971 |author=Willard Learoyd Sperry |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DuagGR8RNsC&amp;pg=PA143 |title=Guide to the YIVO Archives |publisher= |year=1998 |author= YIVO Archives, Fruma Mohrer, Marek Web, Yivo Institute for Jewish Research|accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E8qqhylTDZYC&amp;pg=PA490 |title=Deutsches Judentum unter dem Nationalsozialismus  |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |date= |author=Otto Dov Kulka |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially from the European war fronts.&lt;ref name="Sarna"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.brandeis.edu/hornstein/pdfs/publications/American%20Jewish%20Press%20-%20Oxford%20Handbook.pdf |title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and the American News Media |author=Jonathan D.

In 1922, the JTA moved its headquarters to New York City.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; By 1925, over 400 newspapers (Jewish and general) subscribed to the JTA. Its cable service improved the quality and range of Jewish periodicals.&lt;ref name="Sarna"/&gt; Today, it has correspondents in [[Washington, DC]], [[Jerusalem]], Moscow and 30 other cities in North and South America, Israel, Europe, Africa and Australia. The JTA is committed to covering news of interest to the Jewish community  with [[journalistic objectivity|journalistic detachment]].&lt;ref name="Sarna"/&gt;

In 1940, the JTA spawned the Overseas News Agency (ONA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cit news | newspaper = JTA | date = July 14, 1940 | title = Overseas News Agency Launched | url = https://www.jta.org/1940/07/14/archive/overseas-news-agency-launched}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although designed to appear like a normal news agency, it was in fact secretly funded by the British intelligence service [[MI6]].&lt;ref name=Grisar&gt;{{cite news | author = PJ Grisar | title = Sharks Defending Britain From Nazis?

'''Kaupinam''' ([[Devanagari]]: कौपिनम), '''kaupina''' ([[Devanagari]]: कौपिन)  or '''[[langota|langot]]''' ([[Devanagari]]: लंगोट) is an undergarment worn by Indian men as a [[loincloth]] or [[underclothing]], usually by [[pehalwani|pehalwan]] exercising or [[sparring]] in [[Akhara#Dangal|dangal]] at traditional [[wrestling]] [[akhara]]s. It is made up of rectangular strip of cotton cloth that is used to cover the genitals with the help of the strings connected to the four ends of the cloth for binding it around the waist of the wearer. It is used by wrestlers in the game of ''kushti'' or traditional Indian wrestling in the ''akharada'' (wrestling ring) and during practice sessions and training.

==Use==
It is used extensively by wrestlers (''pehelwans'') in [[India]] participating in the traditional game of ''[[Pehlwani]]'' (a form of traditional wrestling). It is worn by wrestlers during matches, practice, training and exercises (''kasrat'').

The kaupinam in India is the traditional male sports gear associated with almost every form of physically straining sports like kushti and ''[[kabaddi]]''. It has been worn by sportsmen and bodybuilders during training and exercise sessions (similar to the contemporary use of gym shorts) since ancient times and is still used in traditional sports. ''Langot'' was earlier worn (and is still worn sometimes) in India by men performing any form of physically straining activity. The wrestlers often wear a [[G-string]]-shaped guard underneath to protect their genitals.

The kaupinam is a very ancient form of sportswear and was in use since the early [[Vedic Period]] (2000–1500 BC) in India as is evident from a verse in the [[Sam Veda]], the Hindu sacred scriptures, written at that time, encouraging the use of kaupinam during sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=wrestle&gt;{{cite book|last=Alter|first=Joseph S.|title=The wrestler's body: identity and ideology in north India|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|isbn= 9780520076976|pages=305 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; The devotees of [[Lord Shiva]] were said to be wearing kaupinam.

It has religious significance attached to [[asceticism]] for the [[Hindu]]s. [[Bhagavata Purana]] enjoins that a true ascetic shouldn't wear anything other than a kaupina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/sb/7/13/2/ Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 7.13.2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019071350/http://vedabase.net/sb/7/13/2/ |date=2013-10-19 }}, Bhaktivedanta VedaBase&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes Lord Shiva himself is depicted wearing Kaupina.&lt;ref name=shaivism&gt;{{cite book|first=C.

'''Kerry Ray King''' (born June 3, 1964) is an American musician, best known as a guitarist and songwriter for the American [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]]. He co-founded the band with [[Jeff Hanneman]] in 1981 and has been a member ever since.

==Biography==
Kerry Ray King was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. His father was an aircraft parts inspector, and his mother was an employee of a telephone company.&lt;ref name=BloodyReign17/&gt; King attended [[Warren High School (Downey, California)|Warren High School]] in [[Downey, California|Downey]], [[California]], and started learning guitar at Calvano's Music in [[South Gate, California|South Gate]].

In school, King was a good student who excelled in math. However, his grades slowly declined after he "discovered" girls. He said it worked out in the end because he did not plan to go to college. King confesses that he is an experienced drinker, but he has never done drugs in his entire life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawson|first1=Dom|title=Slayer’s Kerry King: My Life Story|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-09-13/slayer-s-kerry-king-my-life-story?ns_type=hidden&amp;ns_campaign=dontmiss&amp;ns_linkname=slayer-s-kerry-king-my-life-story&amp;ns_articleCount=4&amp;ns_articlePosition=4|website=TeamRock.com|accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, King was at a session trying out for the position of guitarist in a band. After the session was over [[Jeff Hanneman]] approached him and the two began playing [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Judas Priest]] songs with the session's drummer. King and Hanneman subsequently decided to start their own band.&lt;ref name="Knac.com interview with Jeff Hanneman"&gt;{{cite web

King's trademark personal appearance and extensive tattoos all over his arms and skin head. His tattoo was praised to such a degree by ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender Magazine]]'' that they once produced a tour of his body ink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blender.com/video/965/KerryKingsTattoos.video?src=blender_ed |title=Tour of Kerry King's Tattoos |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012163343/http://blender.com/video/965/KerryKingsTattoos.video?src=blender_ed |archivedate=October 12, 2007}}, ''Blender'' Online, retrieved on March 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; King's [[abbreviation]], KFK, was revealed to mean "Kerry Fuckin' King" in the January 2007 Issue of ''[[Guitar World]]''.&lt;ref name="metal-rules2004"&gt;{{cite web

==Guest appearances==
In addition to appearing on Slayer's albums, he has also made several guest appearances for other artists. While lending production to 1986's ''[[Reign in Blood]]'', Rick Rubin was also helping with the production of the [[Beastie Boys]]' debut album ''[[Licensed to Ill]]''. Rubin felt the track "[[No Sleep till Brooklyn]]" needed a guitar solo, so he called in King to lay down the part.&lt;ref name="OralHistory"&gt;{{cite web| title= An exclusive oral history of Slayer|publisher=Decibel Magazine|url= http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features_detail.aspx?id=4566|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060813155123/http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features_detail.aspx?id=4566|archivedate= August 13, 2006|accessdate=2006-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; King has since commented that his playing ability "certainly wasn't that of a virtuoso".&lt;ref name="OralHistory"/&gt; The video for "No Sleep till Brooklyn", whose title was a spoof on [[Motörhead]]'s 1981 live album ''[[No Sleep 'til Hammersmith]]'', was originally intended to feature King being knocked offstage by a gorilla, although King refused.&lt;ref name="OralHistory"/&gt; King replied, "If there's gonna be anyone knocking anyone offstage, it'll be me knocking the gorilla", which was what subsequently happened.&lt;ref name="OralHistory"/&gt; King has reminisced that he thought the Beastie Boys were cool, although he had never heard any of their music at the time.&lt;ref name="OralHistory"/&gt;

On ''Licensed to Ill'', King also played the guitar solo on the song "[[Fight For Your Right (To Party)]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McIver|first=Joel|title=Nu Metal – The Next Generation of Rock &amp; Punk (Omnibus Press)|year=2002|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|isbn=978-0-7119-9209-2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King contributed a lead guitar outro part to [[Pantera]]'s song "[[Goddamn Electric]]", which appeared on the 2000 album, ''[[Reinventing the Steel]]''.&lt;ref name="KNACKing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive!

Many fans noticed elements of King's own style used on these occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mansonwiki.com/wiki/2008/02/23_Los_Angeles,_CA 2008/02/23 Los Angeles, CA] – MansonWiki.com&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, 2010, the final date of the [[Jägermeister]] Music Tour, King joined Megadeth on stage at the [[Gibson Amphitheater]] in [[Hollywood]] to perform "Rattlehead" which was the first time in 26 years that King had shared the stage with Megadeth (King had been a touring substitute for a few months in 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=148091 |title=Blabbermouth.Net – Slayer's Kerry King To Perform With Megadeth Tonight! |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025111722/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=148091 |archivedate=October 25, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allmusic. Retrieved 2010-12-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Thom Jurek, also of AllMusic, described his work on 2006's ''[[Christ Illusion]]'' as creating "an intensely harrowing and angular riff that changes from verse to verse, through the refrain and bridge, and comes back again."&lt;ref&gt;Thom Jurek [http://www.allmusic.com/album/christ-illusion-r849648/review "Christ Illusion – Slayer"]. Allmusic. Retrieved 2010-12-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
King has been twice divorced and has a daughter named Shyanne Kymberlee King with his first wife; his current wife is Ayesha King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After 25 years, Slayer keeps casting metal|author=Beck, Aaron|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch|date=February 10, 2007|url=http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/02/10/20070210-B1-02.html|accessdate=2007-02-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66WBAhlvg?url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/404.html|archivedate=March 29, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King is known to despise organized religion and expresses his views in his songwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKibbin|first1=Adam|title=Slayer: A conversation with Kerry King|url=http://www.theredalert.com/features/slayer.php|website=The Red Alert|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 interview with [[Blabbermouth.net]], King expressed his anti-religious views: "I don't really have a life philosophy; my thing is just rebelling against pretty much organized religion. That is my main thing, because personally I think it's a crutch for people that are too weak to get through life on their own. I'm the kind of guy that says if I don't see it, then it doesn't work. And nobody can show me God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/slayer-s-kerry-king-my-thing-is-rebelling-against-organized-religion/|title=Slayer's Kerry King: 'My Thing Is Rebelling Against Organized Religion' - Blabbermouth.net|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by ''[[Revolver Magazine]]'' what superpower would he want if he was a supervillain, King replied "the ability to burst a church into flames by simply walking by it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wiederhorn|first1=Jon|title=Mayhem Festival’s Headliner Slayer Featured on the Cover of Next Issue of Revolver — Read an Excerpt from the Cover Story|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/news/mayhem-festivals-headliner-slayer-featured-on-the-cover-of-next-issue-of-revolver-read-an-excerpt-from-the-cover-story.html|website=Revolver Magazine|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Former Catholics''' or '''ex-Catholics''' are people who used to be [[Catholic]] for some time, but no longer identify as such. This includes both individuals who were at least nominally raised in the [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith, and individuals who converted to it in later life, both of whom later rejected and left it, or converted to other faiths (including the related non-Roman Catholic faiths). This page lists well-known individuals in history who are former Catholics.

One 2008 [[Pew Research Center]] study estimates that 10.1% of people in the United States describe themselves as former Catholics in some sense, in total the study reports that 44% of Americans profess a different religious affiliation than the one they were raised in. A majority converted to another religion while a substantial minority are counted as currently unaffiliated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2008/02/01/chapter-2-changes-in-americans-religious-affiliation/ |title=Religion in America: U.S. Religious Data, Demographics and Statistics - Pew Research Center |work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |date=11 May 2015 |accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: The list includes those who leave the Catholic Church including any [[Eastern Catholic Church]] which is in communion with it. People such as [[Eddie Doherty]], who were allowed to transfer from the [[Latin Church|Latin Catholic Church]] to an Eastern Catholic church, or ''[[vice versa]]'' are not considered  as "former Roman Catholics", while Eastern Catholics who convert to a non-Catholic church or another religion are considered as such, even though Eastern Catholics do not typically refer to themselves as "Roman".

===''Gottgläubigkeit''===
The ''[[gottgläubig]]'' movement was an officially sanctioned unorganised religion in [[Nazi Germany]]. Several prominent Nazi leaders started leaving their Catholic or Protestant churches over the course of 1936 as an act of political protest after a gradual worsening of relations with the churches, whom they accused of meddling in Germany's internal affairs. The ''Gottgläubigen'' stressed they still believed in a creator-God who guided the German nation, and rejected atheism and irreligion. The movement disappeared shortly after World War II.

===Debatable===
This section lists some who, while adopting ideas that some others would consider incompatible with the Catholic faith, may have defected from the Church neither by a [[actus formalis defectionis ab Ecclesia catholica|formal act]] nor even informally by an act of [[heresy]], [[schism (religion)|schism]] or [[apostasy]]. Mere attendance at services of another religion or adoption of certain meditation techniques need not signify abandonment of one's own religion. According to a 2009 survey of the Pew Research Center Forum on Religion and Public Life, one in five American Catholics report that they at times attend places of worship other than the local Catholic parish (which does not have to mean non-Catholic places). The same survey noted that some Catholics incorporate "yoga as a spiritual practice", emphasize psychics, and draw on and involve themselves in other religious movements.&lt;ref&gt;Editors, "Believers mix their creeds, survey finds", ''The Tablet'', 19/26 December 2009, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

London Jewish Cultural Center [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=London_Jewish_Cultural_Centre&amp;action=edit]
}}The '''London Jewish Cultural Centre''' ('''LJCC'''; formerly the Spiro Institute) was a charitable organisation based (from 2005) at [[Ivy House]], the former home of prima ballerina [[Anna Pavlova]], in North End Road, [[Golders Green]], London.&lt;ref name="Dysch 180914"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/122915/two-cultural-institutions-very-different-stories | title=Two cultural institutions with very different stories | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=18 September 2014 | accessdate=20 September 2014 | author=Dysch, Marcus}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provided an educational programme of courses, events and leisure activities.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ljcc.org.uk/about/background | title=Exploring, Learning, Connecting at the London Jewish Cultural Centre | publisher=London Jewish Cultural Centre | work=Background | accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014 it was announced that the London Jewish Cultural Centre would merge with [[JW3]], the Jewish Community Centre London. JW3 and LJCC merged in March 2015, forming a single, enhanced organisation. The merged organisation runs a variety of events from the JW3 site on [[Finchley Road]], London.

==History==
The LJCC was previously known as the '''Spiro Institute'''. The Spiro Institute was created by Robin Spiro and his wife Nitza,&lt;ref name="Spiro lecture"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.jw3.org.uk/event/jw3-presents-inaugural-annual-spiro-lecture#.Usr1nbQ3UYI | title=JW3 presents the inaugural annual Spiro lecture | publisher=[[JW3]] | work=Events | date=January 2014 | accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palgrave"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJc8afOZV0QC&amp;pg=PA948&amp;lpg=PA948&amp;dq=nitza+robin+spiro&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hMPzIHRysA&amp;sig=y8ez9tJkDKc1kAzuMqu5QEJGwFE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D_fKUtfnIfCV7Abs-4GYAw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=nitza%20robin%20spiro&amp;f=false | title=Spiro, Robin Myer | publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] | work=The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History | date=2011 | accessdate=6 January 2014 | author=Rubinstein, William D; Jolles, Michael; Rubinstein, Hilary L. (editors) | pages=948}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was its Executive Director from 1983 to 1998.

==Organisation==
Louise Jacobs succeeded Trudy Gold as Chief Executive in 2011&lt;ref name="Joseph"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/community/community-life/54351/ljcc-chief-cooks-a-cultural-alternative | title=LJCC chief cooks up a cultural alternative | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=8 September 2011 | accessdate=20 January 2014 | author=Joseph, Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained so until 31 January 2015, when she stepped down to be succeeded by Raymond Simonson, Chief Executive of JW3. Michael Marx was Chairman.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

==Holocaust education==
LJCC's Holocaust and Anti-Racism Education Department sought to fight prejudice and bigotry through education and to emphasise the relevance of the [[Holocaust]] for humanity as a whole. It ran educational programmes in the UK, and – under the auspices of the [[International Task Force for Holocaust Education]] – in Eastern Europe and in China. The Department also advised many organisations, including the [[BBC]], on issues related to the Holocaust and racism.&lt;ref name="Holocaust"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ljcc.org.uk/holocaust/ | title=Introduction: Holocaust and Anti-Racism Department | publisher=London Jewish Cultural Centre | work=Holocaust and Anti-Racism | accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In January 2011, with the backing of [[Michael Gove]], who was then [[Secretary of State for Education]], the LJCC launched ''The Holocaust Explained'', an education website for secondary school children.&lt;ref name="Elgot"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/holocaust-memorial-day/44228/michael-gove-backs-holocaust-study-aid-schools | title=Michael Gove backs Holocaust study aid for schools | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=27 January 2011 | accessdate=6 January 2014 | author=Elgot, Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Envoy"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-envoy-for-post-holocaust-issues-launches-the-holocaust-explained-website | title=UK Envoy for post-Holocaust issues launches 'The Holocaust Explained' website | publisher=[[Her Majesty's Government]] | work=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] | accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
The Centre held 97 paintings by the artist Yonia Fain (born 1913).&lt;ref name="Paintings"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/galleries/locations/london-jewish-cultural-centre-6511 | title=London Jewish Cultural Centre | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=Your paintings: Uncovering the nation's art collection | accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lyman Pierson Powell''' (September 21, 1866 - February 10, 1946) was an [[United States|American]] [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] [[clergyman]] and college president.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Farmington, Delaware]]. He graduated from [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1890, studied at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and the [[Philadelphia Divinity School]] where he graduated in 1897. He was ordained a priest in 1898. He became president of [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]] and of [[William Smith College]] ([[Geneva, New York]]) in 1913. 

He died in [[Morristown, New Jersey]] at the [[Morristown Medical Center|Morristown Memorial Hospital]] on February 10, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Rev. Dr. Powell, Author, 79, Dies.

His age was 79. His home was at 100 Hanover Road, this place. ...  |work=[[New York Times]] |date= February 11, 1946|accessdate=2010-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles S. Macfarland wrote a biography of Powell in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, Sidney E. (1948). ''Reviewed Work: Lyman Pierson Powell: Pathfinder in Education and Religion by Charles S. MacFarland''. ''[[The Journal of Religion]]'' 28 (1): 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian Science==

Powell wrote a critical book, denouncing [[Christian Science]] in 1907. The book is notable for describing Christian Science as "neither Christian nor scientific."&lt;ref name="Corey 1950"&gt;Corey, Arthur. (1950). ''Christian Science Class Instruction''. The Farrallon Press. pp. 257-258&lt;/ref&gt; 

He later radically changed his position and wrote a supportive biography of [[Mary Baker Eddy]] in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Gottschalk|Gottschalk, Stephen]]. (1978). ''Christian Science''. University of California Press. p. 211. {{ISBN|0-520-03718-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powell's biography was authorized by the [[The First Church of Christ, Scientist|Mother Church]] and he was given access to their archives. The Church hoped that the biography would rebut the criticisms of [[Edwin Franden Dakin]].&lt;ref name="Corey 1950"/&gt; He has been described as a "warm sympathizer" of Christian Science.&lt;ref&gt;Macfarland, Charles S. (1947). ''Lyman Pierson Powell: Pathfinder in Education and Religion''. New York: Philosophical Library. p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Sutherland Bates]] negatively reviewed Powell's 1930 biography commenting "His method of vindicating Mrs. Eddy is simply to ignore all the charges against her including those which he himself has made." Bates noted that Powell's criticisms of Eddy that he made in 1907 such as her indebtedness to [[Phineas Quimby]] do not appear in his later biography.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Sutherland Bates|Bates, Ernest Sutherland]]. (October 25, 1930). [http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1930oct25-00268 ''Before and After Taking'']. ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|The Saturday Review]]''. p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6533">'''[[Madagascar|Malagasy]] [[mythology]]''' is rooted in [[oral history]] and has been transmitted by [[storytelling]] (''angano'', "story"), notably the Andriambahoaka epic, including the [[Ibonia]] cycle.
 
Traditional mythology in Madagascar tells of a [[creator deity]] referred to as ''Zanahary'', and the division of [[Heaven]] and [[Earth]] between Zanahary and his son, [[Andrianerinerina]], a rebellious [[hero]] and frequent theme of their worship as the son of God,&lt;ref&gt;Ottino, P. (1983). ''Ancient Malagasy Dynastic Succession: The Merina Example.''  History in Africa, 10, 247-292.&lt;/ref&gt; or between Zanahary and earth deities such as [[Ratovantany]] which crafted human bodies from clay; in these myths Zanahary gave life to humans, and their souls return to him on the sky or on the sun while their bodies return to the earth deities.&lt;ref name="madagascarcreationmyth"&gt;https://www.scilt.org.uk/portals/24/passeport2/educationscotland/Images/MadagascarCreationMyth_tcm4-730169.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Andrianerinerina, the word ''Andriamanitra'' (the [[Merina people|Merina]] term for "Fragrant Lord") is used to refer to revered ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;http://malagasyword.org/bins/teny2/Andriamanitra&lt;/ref&gt; Malagasy cultures were generally [[polytheistic]], and worshiped a variety of entities that straddled the line between god and revered ancestor.&lt;ref name="folktalescreolization"&gt;Lee Haring (2007). ''Stars and Keys: Folktales and Creolization in the Indian Ocean'', Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Thompson, Richard Adloff (1965). ''The Malagasy Republic: Madagascar Today'', Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestors are generally viewed as a benevolent force in the life of the living, but among some Malagasy it is believed that the spirits of ancestors may become ''angatra'' (ghosts of the dead) if they are ignored or abused.&lt;ref name="littleton"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gods, goddesses, and mythology |last=Littleton |first=C. Scott |year=2005 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |location= |isbn= 9780761475590  |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LerKCvsyE6EC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=malagasy+mythology&amp;hl=ko&amp;ei=jQEcTKXdA4PEOK6btZMM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angatra are believed to haunt their own graves and bring disease and misfortune to those living who offended them.  A particular type of angatra is the ''kinoly'': beings which look like people but have red eyes and long fingernails and disembowel living people.&lt;ref name="littleton"/&gt; Rituals such as the ''[[famadihana]]''—rewrapping the bodies of the dead every 5–10 years in fresh ''[[Lamba (garment)|lamba]]'' (handmade cloth)—are believed by some to prevent ''kinoly'' due to the traditional association of the lamba with ''[[Hasina (Madagascar)|hasina]]'', the mystical and sacred life force.&lt;ref name="littleton"/&gt;  Beliefs relating to the powers and activities of the ancestors vary greatly from community to community within Madagascar.

The declarations or actions of ancestors are often the source of ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' (taboos) that shape the social life of Malagasy communities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Across Madagascar, [[lemur]]s are often revered and protected by fady. In all of the origin myths of the [[Indri]] (in [[Betsimisaraka language|Betsimisaraka]] dialect: Babakoto), there is some connection of the lemur with humanity, usually through common ancestry. There are numerous accounts of the origin of the [[Indri]] in particular, but all characterize [[lemur]]s as sacred, and not to be hunted or harmed.

Malagasy mythology portrays a [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]]-like people called the ''[[Vazimba]]'' as the original inhabitants.  Some Malagasy believe that these original inhabitants still live in the deepest recesses of the forest. In certain communities (and particularly in the Highlands), the practice of [[veneration of the dead]] can extend back to veneration of the Vazimba as the most ancient of ancestors. The kings of some Malagasy tribes claim a blood kinship to the Vazimba, including the [[Merina Kingdom|Merina dynasty]] that eventually ruled over all of Madagascar. The Merina claim Vazimba ancestry through the royal line's founder, King [[Andriamanelo]], whose mother, Queen [[Rafohy]], was of the Vazimba.

'''Maya cave sites''' are [[cave]]s used by and associated with the [[Maya civilization]] of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]. Certain beliefs and observances connected with cave sites are also maintained among some [[Maya peoples|contemporary Maya communities]]. These cave sites are understood to have served religious purposes rather than utilitarian ones. Accordingly, archaeological artifacts found within caves can inform interpretations of religious ritual and cave studies combined with epigraphic, iconographic, and ethnographic studies can further inform [[Maya religion]] and society.&lt;ref&gt;Prufer and Brady 2005: 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya cave sites of great interest for the robbers and invaders during the war, so the entrances to some of them were walled up (James Brady as examples leads immured [[Dos Pilas#Caves|caves of Dos Pilas]] and [[Naj Tunich]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/books/bramaw.html James E. Brady and Keith M. Prufer (2005). In the Maw of the Earth Monster: Studies of Mesoamerican Ritual Cave Use. Part 3: The Maya Region. CHAPTER 12: Ethnographic Notes on Maya Q’eqchi’ Cave Rites: Implications for Archaeological Interpretation. Organization of Q’eqchi’ Maya Sacred Geography. Page № 313]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==
The total number of caves in the [[Puuc region]] in the [[Yucatan]] is estimated in more than 2000, most of which is not open (the most extensive to date inventory has about 300 caves).&lt;ref name="artdaily.com"&gt;[http://artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=31676 Аrtdaily.org. Maya Caves and Caverns Registration Continues]&lt;/ref&gt; In compiled in the fight against [[idolatry]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]] chronicles 16th century mentioned 17 sites [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[cave]]s and [[cenote]]s (of which found 9 caves).&lt;ref name="INAH. Templos subterráneos"&gt;[http://www.inah.gob.mx/boletines/14-hallazgos/1598-templos-subterraneos INAH. Templos subterráneos]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]] author [[Diego de Landa]] described [[Sacred Cenote]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiansworld.org/cenote.html Гуляев. Древние Майя. Загадки погибшей цивилизации]&lt;/ref&gt; Underground Maya archeology was actively developing starting from the 1980s-1990s.&lt;ref name="utexas.edu"&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/books/bramaw.html James E. Brady and Keith M. Prufer (2005). In the Maw of the Earth Monster: Studies of Mesoamerican Ritual Cave Use. Part 3: The Maya Region.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Museo Nacional de Antropología]] leads two projects to study the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] caves: ''Caves: Register of Prehispanic Cultures Evidence in Puuc Region'' with 1997 year&lt;ref name="artdaily.com"/&gt; and ''The cult of the cenotes in the center of the Yucatan''.&lt;ref name="INAH. Templos subterráneos"/&gt; In 2008, a Mayan underground complex consisting of eleven temples, the 100-meter stone roads and flooded labyrinth of caves, was found on the [[Yucatan Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/15/us-mexico-mayans-idUSN1442474520080815 |title=Portal to mythical Mayan underworld found in Mexico |author=Miguel Angel Gutierrez |date=15 August 2008 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=2011-09-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AEO5BHwG?url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/15/us-mexico-mayans-idUSN1442474520080815 |archivedate=27 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous caves are the Maya: [[Balankanche]], [[Loltun Cave]], [[Actun Tunichil Muknal]] and [[Jolja']].

==Associations with writing==
[[File:Maya Hieroglyph Fig 7 4.png|thumb|right|"sign entry" or "impinged bone element" (versions early and late of the classical period Maya)]]

At the moment it is not known exactly what the sign represents a cave in the Maya writing. According to the hypothesis of James Brady cave means popular in the Mayan texts "sign entry" or "impinged bone element" (see figure). James Brady proposes to read this sign as CH'EN or CH'EEN. As proof of his hypothesis, James Brady cites three arguments: 1) use of the mark in the sentence denotes to a certain place in which you can enter, sit down or do a burial. 2) visual mark has common features with symbols of death, the underworld and bats. 3) phonetically the mark ends in a consonant "N". In Maya writing this sign is part of the verb "OCH-WITZ" ("Go inside the Mountain")&lt;ref name="utexas.edu"/&gt;

==Association with settlement==
A desire to be near the sacred has influenced [[Mesoamerica]]n settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Dunning et al. 1999: 652&lt;/ref&gt; Mountains and caves were important elements in [[Mesoamerican creation myths]]. Mesoamerican belief systems liken water to fertility and mountains give flowing water and rainfall through caves.&lt;ref&gt;Prufer and Kindon 2005: 28&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, these natural features were considered sacred and were sought out by Mesoamerican migrants looking for a new home.&lt;ref&gt;Brady and Prufer 2005: 368&lt;/ref&gt; A cave could be considered an ''[[axis mundi]]'' if it marked the center of a village (Brady and Ashmore 1999: 127). The Late Postclassic site of [[Mayapan]] incorporated several ''[[cenote]]s'' into its ceremonial groups and the [[Cenote Ch’en Mul]] is at the site core.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh 2005: 54&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Dos Pilas]] house platforms were often in front of cave entries and the tunnel went beneath the platform.&lt;ref&gt;Brady and Ashmore 2005: 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural landscapes and themes==
Artificial landscapes often mimicked sacred landscapes. Doorways of temples were seen as the cave entrances to mountains. Sometimes these doorways were ''witz'' monster mouths.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999: 51, 55&lt;/ref&gt; The same was true for the Aztecs, who at [[Utatlán]] designed an artificial cave that ends under the central plaza and is designed according to the mythical seven-chamber cave of emergence, [[Chicomoztoc]] (this is also seen at [[Teotihuacan]], though somewhat different).&lt;ref&gt;Brady and Prufer 2005: 373&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Muklebal Tzul]] it appears that an artificial well underneath a massive platform was made to appear like a water-bearing cave.&lt;ref&gt;Prufer and Kindon 2005: 40&lt;/ref&gt; In the Yucatán many Late Postclassic temples had Spanish churches built on top of them after the conquest and so caves and ''cenotes'' can still be found near these places today.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh 2005: 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrances to the Underworld==
Caves are often described as entries into the watery [[Maya underworld]]. For Mesoamerican groups, including the Maya, life and death occur at [[Liminality|liminal]] zones between this world and the otherworld. Caves then are both associated with life and death; when something emerges from the underworld, that something lives, and when something descends into the underworld, that something dies. Caves are seen as birthplaces where humans and group ancestors were born (and live) and the Maya of the Yucatán even thought that the sun and moon were born out of the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh 2005: 50; Moyes 2005: 189; Brady and Colas 2005: 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associations with sex and fertility==
There appears to be a strong association (and perhaps conflation) between caves and [[sweatbath]]s. Caves are often perceived as female and are likened to the womb and vagina. Hence they are a symbol of fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Brady and Prufer 2005: 369&lt;/ref&gt; Like caves, sweatbaths have also been associated with human fertility and both have strong sexual connotations.&lt;ref&gt;Moyes 2005: 189&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these sexual connotations include the painting of a couple engaged in intercourse at the cave site of [[Naj Tunich]], the contemporary [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzil]] Maya belief that a hypersexual being lives in a cave, and the fact that sweatbaths have been places of illicit sex amongst many Maya groups.&lt;ref&gt;Moyes 2005: 190&lt;/ref&gt; Artifacts found at a sweatbath on the periphery of [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]] included a circular [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirror]] and five marine shells, artifacts that have been associated with the watery underworld and the latter of which has been found in the artificial caves underneath the [[Pyramid of the Sun]] at Teotihuacan.&lt;ref&gt;Moyes 2005: 193; Christenson 2001: 80&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Speleothems]] in caves have also been regarded as sacred and have played a role in Maya religion. Caves are considered to be "living beings with personhood and souls".&lt;ref name="Brady and Prufer 2005: 370"&gt;Brady and Prufer 2005: 370&lt;/ref&gt; and according to a 41-year-old Q’eqchi’ Maya their speleothems "are also alive, they grow and sweat water; they themselves are water".&lt;ref&gt;Brady et al. 2005: 218&lt;/ref&gt; People may take these rocks from the caves and put them on their altars.&lt;ref&gt;Brady et al. 2005: 219&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xibun]] Maya incorporated speleothems into the construction of the [[ball court]] at the Hershey site.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson et al. 2005: 233&lt;/ref&gt; Ball courts have been associated with the underworld just as caves have been.

==Associations with natural forces==
Caves are linked with wind,&lt;ref&gt;Pugh 2005: 50&lt;/ref&gt; rain, and clouds. The Zinacantecos of the [[Chiapas highlands]] even believe that lightning comes from caves.&lt;ref name="Brady and Prufer 2005: 370"/&gt; The Yukatek and Lacandon believe that caves and ''[[cenotes]]'' are where rain deities reside and the Yukatek of the sixteenth century sacrificed humans to appease these deities.&lt;ref&gt;Morehart 2005: 174-75&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Dos Pilas]] the Cueva de Murciélagos rests beneath the royal palace platform. After it rains heavily water rushes out from this cave signaling the beginning of the rainy season and the advance of the crop cycle. This artificial landscape showed that the king had control over water, rainmaking, and fertility, thereby legitimizing his authority.&lt;ref&gt;Brady and Ashmore 1999: 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Caves in art have also been used to legitimize authority and elevate status. Individuals in the mouth of a cave for example are endowed with authority that is often associated with [[shamanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Brady and Ashmore 1999: 127&lt;/ref&gt; Scribal imagery is often associated with a skeletal jaw (maws are often likened to the mouths of caves), which may indicate that caves are where his craft originated. Perhaps this imagery "served to mystify and exalt the scribe's role."&lt;ref&gt;Stone 2005: 141-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associations of art and ritual==
Caves are often associated with transformation. One artifact in the Cenote X-Coton is a human stone figure that is making an offering and wearing a (possible) jaguar skin with the human's face coming out of its mouth. It appears that in addition to water and sacrifice rituals the ''cenote'' may have been used for ''[[wayob|way]]'' transformations.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh 2005: 57-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sacrifice to gods connected to caves was widespread. The sacrifice either occurred in the cave or the body was put there afterwards. Children were commonly sacrificed in the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]]&lt;ref&gt;Scott and Brady 2005: 275&lt;/ref&gt; and child sacrifice was recorded in Highland Guatemala as well.&lt;ref&gt;Owen 2005: 336&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists have found caves that have been sealed such as the [[Cueva de El Duende]]. It is possible that the desecration of caves could have been used as a symbol of conquest and political legitimacy. Another explanation could relate to termination rituals that have often been seen in architectural construction.&lt;ref&gt;Brady and Colas 2005: 161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offerings==
Agricultural products are common offerings in caves. Modern Maya believe that [[maize]] originated beneath the earth, an idea perhaps expressed by Classic depictions of the [[Maya maize god|Maize God]] emerging from the underworld. This belief gives caves life-giving power as accounts from the [[Popul Vuh]] indicate that humans were made from maize dough. Domesticated plants found in lowland caves were probably used in rituals performed for deities related to agricultural fertility. Use of agricultural products in agricultural rituals continues amongst the contemporary Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Morehart 2005: 174-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jade use in Mesoamerica|Jade]] is a frequent cave offering. The largest amount of jade found at one site is at the [[Cenote of Sacrifice]] at [[Chichen Itza]]. Metal was a common offering during the Postclassic, the largest collections coming from the Cenote of Sacrifice and "bell" caves in western [[Honduras]]. It is possible that the notion of the Earth Lord having lots of wealth in his cave may have come from this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Brady 2005: 121, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burials==
Mayans believed, that the cave home of [[ancestral spirits]], why do in they burial people.&lt;ref name="utexas.edu"/&gt; It appears that [[elite]] cave burial was rare,&lt;ref&gt;Scott and Brady 2005: 269&lt;/ref&gt; but it is possible that common people may have used caves as burial places for their dead such as at the [[Caves Branch Rock Shelter]] in [[Belize]]. Two tomb structures have been discovered in caves to date. One at the site of [[Naj Tunich]] and the other at Quen Santo,&lt;ref&gt;Kieffer 2009&lt;/ref&gt; both in Guatemala. Lineage founders have also been buried in caves. Elites were able to build their own elaborate burial "caves" and by doing so reinforced their power and status. It seems elites tried to make their tombs look like natural caves. Stalactites found at Tomb 2 of [[Nim Li Punit]] provide an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;Glassman and Bonor Villarejo 2005: 293-4; Brady and Colas 2005: 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nancy Campbell Academy''' (formerly Nancy Campbell Collegiate Institute) is a grade 7 through 12 (day-school or [[Boarding school|residentia]]l) Canadian accredited international private [[Bahá'í school]] in [[Stratford, Ontario]], Canada. Emphasizing its "twin pillars" of academic excellence and a clear moral framework, ''NCA'' satisfies the [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)]] standards, leading to the [[Ontario Secondary School Diploma]] (OSSD). The Institute was named after Nancy Campbell (1905-1980), an accomplished pianist, artist, actress and dancer, who lived as a "world citizen" motivated by her belief in the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. Campbell worked to promote the ideal of the oneness of humanity, and was a dynamic speaker who travelled throughout the world giving lectures on peace and world unity. Breakwell Education Inc. established NCA in 1994 as Nancy Campbell Collegiate Institute, or NCCI. Within seven years of its founding, NCA was among 16 schools rated Number One in a [[Fraser Institute]] survey of 816 Ontario high schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinsquest.com/personal/ontario_university_thestar.htm Giving it the college try] by Vivian Macdonald, The Toronto Star&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nancycampbell.net/news002.html Nancy Campbell Collegiate scored a perfect 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twin pillars==
Academic excellence and a defined moral framework, based on 19 Moral Leadership Capabilities, are the twin pillars of NCA.
The Institution approaches the education process with a lenient model of teachers as counsellors, guides, and friends, based on a relationship of concern and mutual respect.
The Secondary School (Grade 7 – 12) academic programs include:
*Arts and Humanities
*Science, Design and Technology,
*Wildfire Outdoor Education Centre for Environmental Studies,
*Performing, Visual, and Media Arts
*World Citizenship Curriculum

Students participate in the Advanced Placement Program in association with the [[College Board]], the American body of college and high school instructors that provide students with college/university level credits for [[advanced standing]] when they arrive at post-secondary education institutions. Many students have received scholarships with institutions such as [[McGill University]], [[McMaster University]] and the [[University of Toronto]]. Other programs include Independent Tutorial and accredited English as a Second Language as needed.

The Moral Framework used by the institute was adapted from the Moral Framework developed at [[Nur University (Bolivia)|Universidad Nur]]. It is harmonized with the [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. For example, two of the moral capabilities include:
*Thinking systematically and strategically in search for solutions.
*Encouraging others and bringing happiness to their hearts.

==Student life==
Formal qualities of student life at NCA include a "student family", proactive counseling programme, and group spiritual observances. "Student families" are annualized groupings of students of different ages, races, nationalities, religions, talents and abilities who are carefully grouped in a way such that strengths and weaknesses are balanced out by all the members. The families and their faculty sponsors work together to plan and participate in service projects, hold social and family unity activities and consult together on school-related issues. In the counseling programme students learn how to resolve conflicts through effective communication making decisions that are compatible with spiritual and personal values. Effort is also made to educate students about the effects of drug and alcohol addictions, safe dating practices, and goal setting. The spiritual life at NCA is shared by staff and students which observe religious and cultural celebrations from around the world. Service projects are actively formulated with a strong international, but also local, outlook. Students have participated in community service projects in the following countries:

{{div col end}}

==Campus==
Until 2013, the campus was situated in the heart of London, Ontario/Canada, at the edge of the [[Thames River (Ontario)|Thames River]]. The campus, with its historical buildings built in the 1870s, had been beautifully restored after NCA bought out the former [[Weldon Park Academy]] which closed in 2003. The Institute was founded in 1994 in [[Stratford, Ontario]], Canada and is located there today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3615">'''National mysticism''' (German ''Nationalmystik'') is a form of [[nationalism]] which raises the [[nation]] to the status of [[numen]] or [[divinity]]. Its best known instance is [[Ariosophy|Germanic mysticism]], which gave rise to [[Nazi occultism|occultism]] under the "[[Third Reich]]". The idea of the nation as a divine entity was presented by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]. National mysticism is closely related to [[Romantic nationalism]], but goes beyond the expounding of romantic sentiment, to a [[mysticism|mystical]] veneration of the nation as a transcendent truth. It often intersects with [[ethnic nationalism]] by pseudohistorical assertions about the origins of a given [[ethnicity]].

National mysticism is encountered in many nationalisms other than Germanic or Nazi mysticism, and expresses itself in the use of [[occult]], [[pseudoscientific]], or [[pseudohistorical]] beliefs to back up nationalistic claims, often involving unrealistic notions of the antiquity of a nation ([[antiquity frenzy]]) or any [[national myth]] defended as "true" by pseudo-scholarly means. Notable instances of national mysticism include:
* The [[Sun Language Theory]] in [[Pan-Turkism]]
* [[Kurdish nationalism|Kurdish nationalists]] often make the claim that they are the descendants of the [[Medes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ethnic Identity of the Kurds in Turkey |author=Martin van Bruinessen |url=http://www.let.uu.nl/~martin.vanbruinessen/personal/publications/Bruinessen_Ethnic_identity_Kurds.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish [[Sarmatism]]
* Greek Epsilonism and [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greeks theory]] (see also and [[List of Ancient Greek tribes]])
* Some branches of [[Historical revisionism|revisionist history theories]] of [[History of Bulgaria|Bulgarians and Bulgaria]] (i.e. '[[Thracians|Thracomania]]') and Macedonian nationalist history theories
* Narratives on the [[origin of the Albanians]] in [[Albanian nationalism]] 
* The Croat [[Illyrian movement]]
* Romanian [[Protochronism]]
* [[Philippine Nationalism|Philippine Destiny]]
* The [[Battle of Kosovo]] as the national myth in [[Serbian nationalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Described as national mysticism in Christian Kind, ''Der Wille zur Macht -Wie sich Milosevic zum Herrscher über Serbien erhob'' [[NZZ Folio]] 06/99&lt;/ref&gt;
* American [[Manifest Destiny]]
* The [[Indigenous Aryans]] theory  in [[Hindu nationalism]]

A '''pentacle''' (also spelled and pronounced as ''pantacle'' in [[Thelema]], following [[Aleister Crowley]], though that spelling ultimately derived from [[Eliphas Levi]])&lt;ref name="CrowleyCLXV"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Master of the Temple (Liber CLXV) |url=http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/Liber165.pdf |first=Aleister |last=Crowley |authorlink=Aleister Crowley |accessdate=21 June 2007}} "The Pantacle of Frater V. I. O."&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[talisman]] that is used in [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] [[evocation]], and is usually made of [[parchment]], paper, or metal (although it can be of other materials), upon which a magical design is drawn. Protective symbols may also be included (sometimes on the reverse), a common one being the six-point form of the [[Seal of Solomon]]. Pentacles may be pieces of parchment or cloth that are sewn to the chest of one's garment, or they may be flat objects that hang down from one's neck in front of one's torso, or they may be flat objects that are placed flat upon the ground or upon an altar. Pentacles are almost always shaped as disks or flat circles.

Many varieties of pentacle can be found in the [[grimoire]] called the [[Key of Solomon]]. In the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], a pentacle is placed within the triangle of evocation. Pentacles are also used in the [[modern paganism|neopagan]] magical religion called [[Wicca]], alongside other [[Magical tools in Wicca|magical tools]]. In the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and Wicca, pentacles symbolize the [[classical element]] earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Witches' Way |title=A Witches' Bible |publisher=Phoenix |location=Custer, Washington |first1=Janet |last1=Farrar |author1-link=Janet Farrar |first2=Stewart |last2=Farrar |author2-link=Stewart Farrar |year=1996 |origyear=1981 |isbn=0-919345-92-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guiley1989"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Witches and Witchcraft |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |first=Rosemary |last=Guiley |authorlink=Rosemary Ellen Guiley |pages=122–124 |year=1989 |isbn=0-8160-2268-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1909 [[Rider-Waite tarot deck|Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck]] (the pentacles of which were designed by [[Arthur Edward Waite]]), and subsequent [[tarot]] decks that are based upon it, and in [[Wicca]], pentacles prominently incorporate a pentagram in their design. This form of pentacle is formed upon a disk which may be used either upon an altar or as a sacred space of its own.

==Definitions==
The first documents to depict pentacles were the 1500s grimoires called [[The Heptameron]] and [[The Key of Solomon]]. In The Heptameron, there is only one pentacle, whereas in the Key of Solomon, there are dozens of different pentacles. The Heptameron's pentacle is a hexagram that is embellished by patee crosses and letters, whereas The Key of Solomon's pentacles have a very broad variety of designs, only two of which are pentagrammic. That contrasts with the later popular false definitions of pentacles from the 1900s, which state that pentacles are inherently pentagrammic.

[[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], the creator of [[Wicca]], got his concept of pentacles in large part from the 1909 [[Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck]], in which the pentacles are disks that are covered with a pentagram. In Gardner's 1949 book [[High Magic's Aid]], and in his 1954 book [[Witchcraft Today]], Gardner defined a pentacle as a "five-pointed star", intending to mean a pentagram. In his 1959 book [[The Meaning of Witchcraft]], Gardner defined a pentacle as a synonym of 'pentagram'. Major dictionaries have taken their definition of the word 'pentacle' from Gerald Gardner, being unaware of its historical inaccuracy. For example, the Online ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2007 revision) states that the words ''pentacle'' and ''[[pentagram]]'' (a five-point [[Eulerian path|unicursal star]]) are essentially synonymous.

There is a particular definition of 'pentacle' among many latter-day Wiccans: Namely, a ''pentacle'' refers to a ''pentagram'' [[Circumscribed circle|circumscribed by a circle]].&lt;ref name="Guiley1989" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The word is first recorded in English usage in 1561,  from earlier French use, in turn from post-classical Latin ''pentaculum'' (from ''penta-'' "fivefold" + ''-culum'' diminutive suffix). The French word had a meaning of "talisman", typically in the shape of a pentagram, but the word could also refer to talismans in the shape of a hexagram.&lt;ref name="OED3rd"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/140279 |chapter=Pentacle |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |date=September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in earlier editions (2nd edition 1989) went on to say    that "some would connect it" with the [[Middle French]] word ''pentacol'' (1328) or ''pendacol'' (1418), a jewel or ornament worn around the neck (from ''pend-'' hang, ''à'' to, ''col'' or ''cou'' neck).&lt;ref name="OED2nd"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.oed.com/oed2/00174753 |chapter=Pentacle |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=2nd |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Godefroy1881"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k50639p |title=Dictionnaire de l'ancienne langue française et de tous ses dialectes du IXe au XVe siècle |publisher=F. Vieweg |location=Paris |first=Frédéric |last=Godefroy |authorlink=Frédéric Godefroy |volume=6 |page=88 |year=1881–1902 |oclc=1034921}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the derivation the [[Theosophical Society]] employ in their glossary:
:...it seems most likely that it comes through Italian and French from the root pend- "to hang", and so is equivalent to a [[pendant]] or [[amulet|charm]] hung about the neck. From the fact that one form of pentacle was the pentagram or star-pentagon, the word itself has been connected with the [[Greek language|Greek]] pente (five).&lt;ref name="TheoGloss"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/pa-peq.htm |chapter=Pa-Peq |title=Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary |publisher=Theosophical University Press |editor-first=Gottfried |editor-last=de Purucker |editor-link=Gottfried de Purucker |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-55700-141-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As magical objects==
''Pentacles'', despite the sound of the word, often had no connotation of "five" in the old magical texts, but were, rather, magical talismans inscribed with any symbol or character. When they incorporated star-shaped figures, these were more often [[hexagram]]s than [[pentagram]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Pentacles showing a great variety of shapes and images appear in the old magical [[grimoire]]s, such as the [[Key of Solomon]]; as [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] summarises it, their use was to "fore-know all future things, &amp; command whole nature, have power over devils, and Angels, and do miracles." Agrippa attributes [[Moses]]' feats of magic in part to his knowledge of various pentacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/agripp3e.htm |title=Of Occult Philosophy, Book 3, Part 5 |last=Agrippa |first=Heinrich Cornelius |authorlink=Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa |others=Trans. John French |year=1651 |origyear=1533 |accessdate=29 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy'' (c. 1565), which was falsely attributed to Agrippa, gives detailed instructions as to how pentacles should be formulated:
:But we now come to speak of the holy and sacred Pentacles and Sigils. Now these pentacles, are as it were certain holy signes preserving us from evil chances and events, and helping and assisting us to binde, exterminate, and drive away evil spirits, and alluring the good spirits, and reconciling them unto us. And these pentacles do consist either of Characters of the good spirits of the superiour order, or of sacred pictures of holy letters or revelations, with apt and fit versicles, which are composed either of Geometrical figures and holy names of God, according to the course and maner of many of them; or they are compounded of all of them, or very many of them mixt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/agrippa4.htm#chap6 |chapter=Concerning Pentacles and Sigils |title=Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy |author=Anonymous |others=Trans. Robert Turner |year=1655 |origyear=c. 1565 |accessdate=29 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett]], in his influential work ''[[The Magus (book)|The Magus]]'' of 1801 (Book 2, part 2), repeats these instructions almost verbatim.

Another common design employed in pentacles is a [[magic square]], such as the [[Sator Square|Sator-Arepo-Tenet square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Introduction by Mathers |title=[[The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage]] |publisher=Dover |location=New York |author=Abraham ben Simeon, of Worms |others=Trans. [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers|S. L. MacGregor Mathers]] |year=1975 |origyear=1897 |isbn=0486232115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] magical system, the Earth Pentacle is one of four [[Classical element|elemental]] "weapons" or tools of an Adept. These weapons are "symbolical representations of the forces employed for the manifestation of the inner self, the elements required for the incarnation of the divine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Golden Dawn |publisher=Llewellyn |location=St. Paul, Minnesota |first=Israel |last=Regardie |authorlink=Israel Regardie |id=Volume I, section 94 |page=47 |year=2003 |isbn=0-87542-663-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pentacles for the evocation of spirits are also employed in the Golden Dawn system; these are engraved with the name and sigil of the spirit to be invoked, inside three concentric circles, having painted on their reverse a circle and cross like a [[celtic cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Z.2: Magical Formulae |title=The Golden Dawn |publisher=Llewellyn |location=St. Paul, Minnesota |first=Israel |last=Regardie |authorlink=Israel Regardie |id=Volume III, section 159 |page=380 |year=2003 |isbn=0-87542-663-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Aleister Crowley]]'s instructions for the [[A∴A∴]], the pentacle is a disc of wax, gold, silver-gilt or [[Electrum Magicum]], eight inches diameter and half an inch thick; the Neophyte should "by his understanding and ingenium devise a symbol to represent the Universe", and engrave this on the disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://lib.oto-usa.org/libri/liber0412.html |title=Liber CDXII: Liber A vel Armorum |chapter=The Pantacle |publisher=A∴A∴ |first=Aleister |last=Crowley |authorlink=Aleister Crowley}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:There is, therefore, nothing movable or immovable under the whole firmament of heaven which is not included in this pantacle, though it be but 'eight inches in diameter, and in thickness half an inch.' Fire is not matter at all; water is a combination of elements; air almost entirely a mixture of elements; earth contains all both in admixture and in combination. So must it be with this Pantacle, the symbol of earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2KUQHX9yZcC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95 |chapter=The Pantacle |title=[[Magick (Book 4)|Magick: Book 4, Liber ABA]] |publisher=S. Weiser |location=[[York Beach, Maine]] |first=Aleister |last=Crowley |authorlink=Aleister Crowley |page=95 |year=1997 |isbn=0-87728-919-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pentacle is also employed as a magical tool within [[Wicca]], generally to summon certain energies or summon spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Witches' Way |title=A Witches' Bible |publisher=Phoenix |location=Custer, Washington |first1=Janet |last1=Farrar |author1-link=Janet Farrar |first2=Stewart |last2=Farrar |author2-link=Stewart Farrar |year=1996 |origyear=1981 |isbn=0-919345-92-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Method of employment===
In many old grimoires dealing with magical evocation, the pentacle is described as being hung about the neck, providing protection and authority to the operator. [[Johannes Trithemius]] has the magician donning the pentacle just before casting the protective circle:
:Then taking your ring and pentacle, put the ring on the little finger of your right hand; hang the pentacle round thy neck; (Note, the pentacle may be either wrote on clean virgin parchment, or engraven on a square plate of silver and suspended from thy neck to the breast)....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/tritheim/trchryst.htm |title=The Art of Drawing Spirits Into Crystals |first=Johannes |last=Trithemius |authorlink=Johannes Trithemius |others=Trans. Francis Barrett, c. 1801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One version of the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'' mentions both a "Great Pentacle" which is drawn in a book, as well as a collection of other pentacles which are drawn in ink on separate pieces of parchment for use as amulets:
:Thou shalt preserve them to suspend from thy neck, whichever thou wilt, on the day and hour wherein thou wast born, after which thou shalt take heed to name every day ten times, the Name which is hung from thy neck, turning towards the East, and thou mayest be assured that no enchantment or any other danger shall have power to harm thee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/l1203.htm |title=The Veritable Clavicles of Solomon |others=Trans. Rabbi Abognazar from Hebrew to Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pentacle is of central importance in the evocation of spirits. A fairly typical evocation involves a series of conjurations of increasing potency, each involving the display of the pentacle:
:...&amp;nbsp;If they then immediately appear, it is well; if not, let the master uncover the consecrated pentacles which he should have made to constrain and command the spirits, and which he should wear fastened round his neck, holding the medals (or pentacles) in his left hand, and the consecrated knife in his right; and encouraging his companions, he shall say with a loud voice:
::Here be the symbols of secret things, the standards, the ensigns, and the banners, of God the conqueror; and the arms of the almighty One, to compel the aerial potencies. I command ye absolutely by their power and virtue that ye come near unto us, into our presence, from whatsoever part of the world ye may be in, and that ye delay not to obey us in all things wherein we shall command ye by the virtue of God the mighty One. Come ye promptly, and delay not to appear, and answer us with humility.
:If they appear at this time, show them the pentacles, and receive them with kindness, gentleness, and courtesy; reason and speak with them, question them, and ask from them all things which thou hast proposed to demand.
:But if, on the contrary, they do not yet make their appearance, holding the consecrated knife in the right hand, and the pentacles being uncovered by the removal of their consecrated covering, strike and beat the air with the knife as if wishing to commence a combat, comfort and exhort thy companions, and then in a loud and stern voice repeat the following conjuration: ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/ksol.htm |title=The Key of Solomon |others=Trans. [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers|S. L. MacGregor Mathers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the spirit has appeared and been constrained, the pentacle is covered again, but is uncovered whenever demands are made of the spirit or when it is compelled to depart.

In the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] system, the pentacles are not suspended from the neck, but wrapped in a cloth covering. Instead of wearing a pentacle, the magician wears fastened to their breast a [[lamen (magic)|lamen]].

==In tarot==
In the [[tarot]], the [[Minor Arcana]] are divided into four suits (much like conventional [[playing card]]s), which are swords, batons or wands, cups, and coins. Following the innovation of [[Eliphas Levi]], many English-language writers on [[tarot divination]] now call the coins "pentacles". The first published tarot deck to use an ''actual'' [[suit of pentacles]] was the 1909 [[Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck]]. That deck inspired the creation of subsequent tarot decks which likewise have a suit of pentacles. In the Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck, [[Arthur Edward Waite]] designed the pentacles as golden disks with a pentagram on them. The Wiccan style of pentacle, which is a disk that is covered by a pentagram symbol, was based upon the pentacles from the Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck.

==In mathematics==
The term ''pentacle'' is used in ''Tilings and Patterns'' by Grumbaum and Shepard to indicate a five-pointed star composed of ten [[line segment]]s, similar to a [[pentagram]] but containing no interior lines.&lt;ref name="Grunbaum1987"&gt;{{cite book |title=Tilings and Patterns |publisher=W.

[[Image:Phimai Prang.jpg|thumb|Main shrine of the Khmer temple in [[Nakhon Ratchasima]], exhibiting a prang.]]
A '''prang''' ({{lang-km|ប្រាង្គ}}; {{lang-th|ปรางค์}}) is a tall tower-like [[spire]], usually richly carved. They were a common shrine element of [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] architecture in the [[Khmer Empire]]. They were later adapted by Buddhist builders in [[Thailand]], especially during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] (1350–1767) and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] (1782-1932). In Thailand it appears only with the most important Buddhist [[temple]]s.

==Etymology==
The term ''prang'' is a compound of the [[Sanskrit]] terms ''pra-'' ('forward, in front') and ''aṅga'' (limb of the body), with the contacting vowels united by [[sandhi]].&lt;ref name="headley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Headley|first=Robert K. |author2=Kylin Chhor |author3=Lam Kheng Lim |author4=Lim Hak Kheang |author5=Chen Chun|title=Cambodian-English Dictionary|publisher=Catholic University Press|date=1977|url=http://sealang.net/khmer/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
''Prang'' tower took form of a multi-tiered structure with receding size as it ascends. The receding size of almost identical roof structures of the stepped pyramidal tower, creates a [[visual illusion|perspective illusion]] as if the tower is taller than it actually is. The form of the tower is a reminiscent of Indic [[shikhara]] of Hindu temple, although slightly different in design. On each cardinal points, a ''prang'' usually has richly adorned [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] and [[lintel]] above doorways or blind doors. The ''prang'' took plan of multi corners rectangular, which on top of each roof steps are adorned with [[antefix]]es, which mostly took theme of multi-headed [[Nāga]]s, [[Garuda]] or deities.

==History==

===Khmer temples===
[[File:Middle tower of Angkor Wat temple.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The central prang of Angkor Wat temple symbolizes the mount [[Mount Meru (Mythology)|Meru]].]]
Originally the Khmer prang temples were for the worship of the [[Hindu]] gods, such as [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]]. The space within the prang tower, the [[cella]], was relatively small for two reasons:
# The rituals which were held in them were reserved for a small elite (in the capital of the Khmer only the god king could enter the shrine).
# The technology of the Khmer could not yet make large airy halls. (Ringis, 1990)

The Cella was entered via a small porch, usually aligned to the east, which was called the [[Mandapa]]. Over the cubic Cella rose the central tower, the [[bud]]-shaped Prang, modeled after the cosmic mountain [[Mount Meru (Mythology)|Meru]], crowned by a top stone in form of a [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] bud.

The Khmer prangs resembled north Indian temples' [[shikhara]] and rekha (temple towers) elements. The early 10th century and the late 12th century prangs in Thailand were influenced by the Khmer architects of the great temple complexes of [[Angkor Wat]] and [[Angkor Thom]].

===Thai temples===
[[Image:Sunset at Wat Chaiwatthanaram, Ayutthaya, Thailand.jpg|300px|thumb|Wat Chaiwatthanaram, an example of Thai style prang]]
The first prangs in Thailand were built in [[Phimai]] and [[Phanom Rung historical park|Khao Phnom Rung]] and [[Lopburi]] between the early 10th century and the late 12th century, when the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] kingdom was dominant.

After the [[Khmer Empire]] collapsed, the Thai building masters of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] adapted the Prang form. They extended and developed it. The building material was no more separate small sandstone blocks, instead the Thais built the Prang in brick or laterite covered with stucco. And the Cella could be reached only by stairs. An example for this is the Prang of the [[Wat Phra Si Rattana Mahathat|Wat Mahathat]] in [[Phitsanulok]]. Later developments of the Prang suggested the Cella only. The entrance door became a niche, in which was placed the [[Buddharupa|''Buddharupa'' (Buddha statue)]], which had originally taken the central position inside. For reasons of symmetry the niche was repeated on all four sides. On its pinnacle was a [[Trishul (weapon)|Trishul]], the "weapon of [[Indra]]".

A "more modern" Prang is a slim construction, like an ear of corn, which lets its Khmer origin be only suspected. The best example is [[Wat Arun]], the landmark of [[Bangkok]]. Also [[Wat Phra Kaeo]] has six thin Prangs arranged in a row. Another example is the four Prangs arranged in all four directions around [[Wat Pho]] in [[Bangkok]], and the five Prangs in [[Wat Pichayart]] in [[Thonburi]].

'''Private revelation''' is, in [[Christian theology]], a message from [[God]] which can come in a variety of types.

==Roman Catholic theology==

According to the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', public revelation was complete in New Testament times, but depends on interpretation and deepening understanding of this foundational or "definitive" revelation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''97''' "Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture make up a single sacred deposit of the Word of God" in which, as in a mirror, the pilgrim Church contemplates God, the source of all her riches.&lt;br&gt;'''66''' "The Christian economy, therefore, since it is the new and definitive Covenant, will never pass away; and no new public revelation is to be expected before the glorious manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ." Yet even if Revelation is already complete, it has not been made completely explicit; it remains for Christian faith gradually to grasp its full significance over the course of the centuries.&lt;br&gt;'''67''' Throughout the ages, there have been so-called "private" revelations, some of which have been recognized by the authority of the Church. They do not belong, however, to the deposit of faith. It is not their role to improve or complete Christ's definitive Revelation, but to help live more fully by it in a certain period of history. Guided by the Magisterium of the Church, the ''sensus fidelium'' knows how to discern and welcome in these revelations whatever constitutes an authentic call of Christ or his saints to the Church. Christian faith cannot accept "revelations" that claim to surpass or correct the Revelation of which Christ is the fulfilment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Divine revelation was fulfilled, [[completed revelation|completed]], and perfected in Christ, the fullness and mediator, author and interpreter, purpose and center of public revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s2a1.htm#2763 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The summary of the whole Gospel |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a1.htm#III |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The Revelation of God |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#105 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - Sacred Scripture |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - Sacred Scripture |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s2a3.htm#2824 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The seven petitions |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#134 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - Sacred Scripture |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, public revelation is the [[Sacred Tradition|deposit of faith]] and [[rule of faith]] and must be lived by all Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html|title=Dei Verbum, 5|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that all public revelation ended with the death of Saint [[John the Apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3174.htm|title=Question 174|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private revelations cannot surpass, correct, improve, fulfill, complete, or perfect public revelation.&lt;ref name="vatican1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a1.htm#66|title=The Vatican on private revelations|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divine revelation, since it is contained in the Word of God and in Christ, also includes the living tradition or ''sensus fidelium'', the [[magisterium]], the sacraments, and [[Catholic dogma]].&lt;ref name="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p1.htm#767"&gt;Catechism, 767&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s1c1a2.htm#1116"&gt;Catechism, 1116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm#88"&gt;Catechism, 88&lt;/ref&gt; Because the living tradition and the magisterium are a part of divine revelation, they both have divine authority.&lt;ref name="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p4.htm#874"&gt;Catechism, 874&lt;/ref&gt; Because the sacraments are a part of divine revelation, their natures cannot be changed (for example, receiving Holy Communion without mortal sin) but their ways of celebration can be changed (for example, receiving Holy Communion in the hand or on the tongue).&lt;ref name="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html"&gt;Redemptionis Sacramentum, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Because Catholic dogma is a part of divine revelation, the saving truths of Christ are immutable.&lt;ref name="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20120106_nota-anno-fede_en.html"&gt;Note with pastoral recommendations for the Year of Faith: "The Council, according to Pope John XXIII, wanted 'to transmit doctrine, pure and whole, without attenuations or misrepresentations,' in such a way that 'this sure and immutable teaching, which must be respected faithfully, is elaborated and presented in a way which corresponds to the needs of our time.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/speeches/1984/may/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19840503_vescovi-coreani.html"&gt;Address of Pope John Paul II to the Bishops of Korea: "In union with Christ you will ponder again what God’s word demands of the Church in Korea. With the courage that comes only with holiness you will accept the full authentic exigencies of the Second Vatican Council for your dioceses. In prayer you will review the perennial teachings of the faith and the ever relevant newness of the Church’s immutable dogmas. In vital communion with Christ, the life-giving vine, and in union with the universal Church, you will continue to preach the word of faith which depends on hearing and which enables the People of God to confess with their lips that Jesus is Lord, to believe in their hearts that God raised him from the dead, and to be saved (Cf. Rom. 10, 9)). This faith - which is nourished in your own hearts and proclaimed with the special episcopal charism that is yours - is the source of all the insights of the faithful, who are called to believe and, in the power of the Holy Spirit, to ponder that belief and live it. "&lt;/ref&gt; But what truths are dogmas has needed to be clarified by church councils, and the much more numerous doctrines have yielded to varied and increased understanding based on solid study of the Biblical roots and of the history of the topic. For this the work of theologians is indispensable, since the charism of the bishops is not to receive revelations but to determine what is Catholic teaching, the more so in doctrines that are more central to the faith and dogmatically taught. The Second Vatican Council of Bishops maintained a careful line between the "two source" (Scripture and the living tradition) and "one source" explanation of revelation, careful to acknowledge the ultimate priority of the original deposit of faith: "For Sacred Scripture is the word of God inasmuch as it is consigned to writing under the inspiration of the divine Spirit, while sacred tradition takes the word of God entrusted by Christ the Lord and the Holy Spirit to the Apostles, and hands it on to their successors in its full purity, so that led by the light of the Spirit of truth, they may in proclaiming it preserve this word of God faithfully, explain it, and make it more widely known."&lt;ref&gt;''Dei Verbum'', 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamental Theology|last=O"Collins, SJ|first=Gerald|publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Pub|year=2001|isbn=1579106765|location=Eugene, Oregon|pages=}}, chapter VIII&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of revelation===

Private revelation is a heavenly message that helps people live by divine revelation.&lt;ref name="vatican1" /&gt; Various types of private revelations have been reported in the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private revelations can come to anyone for so long as God pleases. Some address the visionary, while others address more people. For instance, [[Our Lady of Laus]] appeared to a young shepherdess for many years, while [[Our Lady of Kibeho]] addressed the leaders of the nation of Rwanda .

The appearances of the [[Veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism|Blessed Virgin Mary]] are usually called [[Marian apparitions]]. These generally include a vision of the Blessed Virgin, accompanied by brief messages. These are by far the most widely reported form. Well known examples of approved Marian apparitions include [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] and [[Our Lady of Fátima]]. These apparitions are considered private revelations from God through the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p2.htm#798 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The Church - People of God, Body of Christ, Temple of the Holy Spirit |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marian visions do not mean Mary appears as a disembodied spirit, since she has been [[Assumption of Mary|assumed into heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |title=Apostolic Constitution defining the Dogma of the Assumption - Munificentissimus Deus |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is probable that Mary could appear in bodily form by [[bilocation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15477a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Visions and Apparitions |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some theologians, such as Father Reginaldus, believe that, because Jesus does not appear in bodily form, Mary does not appear bodily either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newtheologicalmovement.blogspot.com/2010/08/where-was-mary-assumed-to.html?showComment=1282020628330#c1810571090577229906 |title=Where was Mary assumed to? &amp;#124; The New Theological Movement |publisher=Newtheologicalmovement.blogspot.com |date=2010-08-14 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Vision (spirituality)|apparitions]] of [[Jesus Christ]] following his [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] have been reported. Some of these have received approval, as safe for private belief, from the [[Holy See]]. For instance, the Vatican biography of [[Faustina Kowalska|Saint Faustina Kowalska]] quotes some of her conversations with Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20000430_faustina_en.html |title=Mary Faustina Kowalska |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparitions of Jesus are not the same as the [[Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], even if they include [[Eucharistic adoration]], because the sacraments are a part of public revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s1.htm#1076 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacramental economy |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparitions are also not the same as the [[Second Coming]], because the church believes Jesus "will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c2a7.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - "From thence He will come again to judge the living and the dead" |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also reports of [[interior locutions]] in which inner voices are reported, but no vision of divinity is claimed. The Vatican biographies of both [[Teresa of Ávila|Saint Teresa of Ávila]] and [[Mother Teresa|Mother Teresa of Calcutta]] refer to their interior locutions, although Mother Teresa often preferred to remain private about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/audiences/2011/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20110202_en.html |title=General Audience of Pope Benedict XVI, 2 February 2011 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20031019_madre-teresa_en.html |title=Mother Teresa of Calcutta (1910-1997), biography |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some private revelations produce large amounts of text, while others amount to a few reported sentences. For instance, father [[Stefano Gobbi]] produced a book of messages attributed to the [[Veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism|Blessed Virgin Mary]], while [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart Droste zu Vischering]] simply wrote two letters to [[Pope Leo XIII]] with a message attributed to [[Jesus Christ]], prompting the Pope to consecrate the world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]].

The church does not regard [[occultism]] – spiritism, automatic writing, astrology, fortune-telling, psychic powers, magic, divination, conjuring the dead, etc. – as types of private revelations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14221a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Spiritism|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11197b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Occult Art, Occultism|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church also does not regard private revelations as having authority over the [[Pope]] or the [[Catholic bishop|bishops]] in communion with him, because the church, the bishop, and public revelation have divine authority as a matter of faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19871014en.html|title=Jesus Christ the Divine Lawgiver|author=John Paul II|date=14 October 1987|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_30091943_divino-afflante-spiritu_en.html|title=Divino Afflante Spiritu|author=Pius XII|date=30 September 1943|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_29061881_diuturnum_en.html|title=Diuturnum|author=Leo XIII|date=29 June 1881|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xv/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xv_enc_01111914_ad-beatissimi-apostolorum_en.html|title=Ad Beatissimi Apostolorum|author=Benedict XV|date=1 November 1914|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while private revelations are not a matter of faith but are believed with human faith.&lt;ref name="Message of Fatima"/&gt; Private revelations neither have divine authority nor can they be believed with divine and catholic faith,&lt;ref name="Message of Fatima"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Message of Fatima"/&gt; and a proof of this is that the Magisterium infallibly interprets the inerrant Word of God,&lt;ref name="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html"&gt;Dei Verbum, 11 &amp; 25: "Therefore, since everything asserted by the inspired authors or sacred writers must be held to be asserted by the Holy Spirit, it follows that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings...It devolves on sacred bishops 'who have the apostolic teaching' to give the faithful entrusted to them suitable instruction in the right use of the divine books, especially the New Testament and above all the Gospels."&lt;/ref&gt; whereas saints can make errors about the details of private revelations,&lt;ref name="Co-Patronesses of Europe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_01101999_co-patronesses-europe_en.html|title=Co-Patronesses of Europe|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; since fallen human nature is inclined to sin and error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a1.htm#1707|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - Man: the image of God|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Catholics cannot disobey the church in favor of obeying private revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a4.htm#2242|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The fourth commandment|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources of revelation===

According to the church private revelations come from God, while false revelations come either from human or demonic sources. Just as in [[exorcism]], the Catholic Church is careful to distinguish between supernatural events, mental illness, drug abuse, deception, and demonic activity. The church gathers a team of scientists, theologians, and other experts to test the spirit of the alleged visionary to see if he is genuine, psychotic or manipulative, influenced by drugs, deceptive or deceived, or possessed by demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/faith/teachings/maryd8.htm|title=Private Revelations|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm#2291|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The fifth commandment|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revelations from God are an extraordinary grace which confirms [[Catholic doctrine]] and dogma. One famous example is [[Our Lady of Lourdes]], who declared Mary to be the [[Immaculate Conception]] four years after the dogma of the Immaculate Conception was proclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lourdes-france.org/index.php?goto_centre=ru&amp;contexte=en&amp;id=417&amp;id_rubrique=417|title=Lourdes|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they are extraordinary, revelations are not to be confused with [[Sanctification#Roman Catholicism|holiness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm#2014|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - Grace and justification|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they are a grace, no one can rightfully desire to receive revelations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a1.htm#65|title=St. John of the Cross|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they remind the faithful of what is already contained in public revelation, private revelations can sometimes occur in unexpected ways, such as the [[stigmata]], which reminds Catholics of the [[Paschal Mystery]]; [[weeping statues]], which remind of sin and Mercy; and the mystical ring of [[Catherine of Siena|Saint Catherine of Siena]], which reminds of [[mystical marriage]].

Mother [[Eugenia Elisabetta Ravasio|Eugenia Ravasio]] reported a series of messages from [[God the Father]], which were published as ''"The Father speaks to His children"''. Mother Ravasio's messages were approved by [[Bishop of Grenoble|Bishop Alexander Caillot of Grenoble]],&lt;ref&gt;"Testimony of the Right Reverend A. Caillot, Bishop of Grenoble, Following the Report Prepared during the Canonical Enquiry into the Case of Mother Eugenia", [http://www.fatherspeaks.net/pdf/the_father_speaks_english_v-2005-02.pdf] pp 5-10.&lt;/ref&gt; that ordered an investigation and after ten years issued a letter stating that the messages had a divine nature. In 1988 the messages received also the imprimatur of Cardinal [[Petrus Canisius Van Lierde]], the [[Vicar General for the Vatican City State]], whose general duties were the administration of daily functions of [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Father Speaks to His Children'' [http://www.fatherspeaks.net/pdf/the_father_speaks_english_v-2005-02.pdf] page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] at the [[Holy See]], which is the official authority for approving private revelations on behalf of the Catholic Church, did not declare Mother Eugenia's writings heresy, so this is not controversial to the Catholic Church.

A common human source of false revelations is [[pareidolia]], where people see visions or hear voices where there are none. The church claims that apparitions and visions cannot be photographed and messages and locutions cannot be recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19351220_ad-catholici-sacerdotii_en.html|title=Ad Catholici Sacerdotii 62|author=Pius XI|date=20 December 1935|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, some people believe in the [[Our Lady of Zeitoun|apparitions of Zeitoun]]; the church, however, has never judged the alleged apparitions.

Another human source of false revelations is misattribution, where people put words into saints' and other persons' mouths, such as the "three days of darkness" prophecy attributed to [[Pio of Pietrelcina|Saint Padre Pio of Pietrelcina]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opusdeialert.com/3daysofdarkness.htm The 3 Days of Darkness] Padre Pio and other Catholics eminent for sanctity, have for centuries prophesied the dreadful coming chastisement of the Three Days of Darkness; where at least half to three quarters of the world's population will be killed by God's Just Wrath.&lt;/ref&gt; the "end-times" prophecy attributed to [[Our Lady of Laus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaeldubruiel.blogspot.com/2008/05/apparition-approved-signal-of-end-of.html|title=Apparition Approved (Signal of the End of Times?)|author=Michael Dubruiel|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Medjugorje sayings attributed to [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;Sr. Emmanuel; Nolan, Denis, ''Međugorje: What Does the Church Say?'', Queenship Publishing (2000) p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the church a common demonic source of false revelations is [[demonic possession]]. It claims that Satan can appear like an angel of light and rebuke people for their sins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newadvent.org/fathers/250105.htm|title=St. Eusebius, Church History, Book V, 16:9|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mimic the miracles and revelations of God. The most famous case is [[Magdalena de la Cruz]], through whom Satan uttered false prophecies and fabricated miracles, including [[Tabor light|uncreated light]], [[stigmata]], [[levitation]], [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasy]], and extraordinary fasting (she allegedly survived solely on the [[Eucharist]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm|title=Imposters|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a misconception that the church is quick to accept mental illness or drug abuse, such as [[schizophrenia]] or [[hallucinogens]], for private revelation and demonic activity. The church is skeptical, and only accepts private revelation after discernment, because it is "the pillar and bulwark of the truth"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c3a2.htm#171|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - We believe|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because it has a long history of dealing with fraudulent visionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Imposters|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discernment of revelation===

Just as with all [[charism]]s, the charisms of [[prophecy]], [[speaking in tongues]], and [[gift of miracles|miracles]] are subject to discernment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p2.htm#799|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The Church - People of God, Body of Christ, Temple of the Holy Spirit|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church uses the 1987 ''[[Normae Congregationis]]'' to discern and judge private revelations. Firstly, the local Catholic bishop judges the alleged revelation according to its fruits:&lt;ref name="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19780225_norme-apparizioni_en.html"&gt;Normae Congregationis, positive and negative criteria&lt;/ref&gt;
:Good Fruits
:*the alleged revelation likely happened/is happening, and is not attributable to [[postdiction]] and [[hoaxes]]
:*the alleged visionary is mentally healthy, honest, humble, and lives a normal life
:*conformity to public revelation and immunity from error in faith or morals
:*healthy devotion to the alleged revelation (adherence to Dogma, submission to the Bishop, obedience of faith, etc.)
:*abundant spiritual fruits that spring from said healthy devotion (prayer, conversion, charity, etc.)
:Bad Fruits
:*the alleged revelation didn't actually happen (someone mistaking [[sun dogs]] for a miracle, etc.)
:*doctrinal errors attributed to God or a Saint, although this does not include redaction 
:*using the alleged revelation for fame, fortune, sex, or other gains 
:*occultism or other grave sins (drug abuse, etc.) in connection with the alleged revelation
:*mental illness, psychotic tendencies, and demonic activity

Examples of revelations with good and bad fruits include:
* the revelations to the Polish mystic St. [[Faustina Kowalska]] were promoted by Pope Saint John Paul II from before his papacy, and received his approval as safe in practice;&lt;ref name="http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2002c/083002/083002f.htm"&gt;John L. Allen Jr, "A saint despite Vatican reservations" (''National Catholic Reporter'', 30 August 2002)"&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Mariavite Church|Mariavite]] revelations contained heresy and attacked critics, despite promoting popular piety and frequency of the sacraments.&lt;ref name="http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-x/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-x_enc_05041906_tribus-circiter.html"&gt;Tribus Circiter, encyclical by Pope Pius X&lt;/ref&gt;

When judgment is favorable, the bishop permits a local devotion without judging the revelation to be worthy of belief, which can include being favorable toward miracles in connection with the revelation without approving of the revelation itself.&lt;ref name="http://www.miraclehunter.com/marian_apparitions/approved_apparitions/faith-expression.html"&gt;Miracle Hunter: Apparitions Approved for Faith Expression&lt;/ref&gt; This step is commonly called "approved for faith expression."&lt;ref name="http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/aprtable.html"&gt;
Marian Apparitions of the Twentieth and Twenty-first Centuries: A Directory of Twentieth and Twenty-first Century Apparitions&lt;/ref&gt; Then, after the bishop sees a healthy devotion to the revelation and abundant spiritual fruits spring from said devotion, he judges the revelation to be worthy of belief: the private revelation contains nothing contrary to Catholic faith or morals, the faithful are authorized to prudently believe in the private revelation (without obligation), and it is legal to publish the private revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20100930_verbum-domini_en.html|title=Verbum Domini|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the bishop approves of the titles – such as "[[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]]" – given to a Marian apparition (Our Lady of Lourdes, for example).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/speeches/1964/documents/hf_p-vi_spe_19641205_mount-mary-in-bandra_en.html|title=Visit to the Marian Shrine of Our Lady of Bandra|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judgment on private revelations falls under a bishop's ordinary [[magisterium]], which is authoritative but noninfallible and requires religious submission of intellect and will. A bishop or his successor could overturn a prior judgment, such as happened in the case of the apparitions of the [[Lady of all Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/our_lady_of_all_nations.htm|title=Our Lady of All Nations|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bishop can judge an alleged private revelation to be either worthy of belief (''constat de supernaturalitate'') or not worthy of belief (''constat de non supernaturalitate''). A private revelation that is worthy of belief can receive full approval if it is approved by the Pope, such as happened with the revelations to St. Margaret Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_08051928_miserentissimus-redemptor_en.html|title=Miserentissimus Redemptor 3|author=Pius XI|date=8 May 1928|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papal approval does not include popes visiting sites of alleged revelations, granting special privileges to shrines, offering gifts to alleged visionaries, or speaking favorably of alleged revelations or visionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19780225_norme-apparizioni_en.html Normae Congregationis] It is up to the Sacred Congregation to judge and approve the Ordinary’s way of proceeding or, in so far as it be possible and fitting, to initiate a new examination of the matter, distinct from that undertaken by the Ordinary and carried out either by the Sacred Congregation itself or by a special Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; A private revelation that is not worthy of belief can either be more fully investigated or, if bad fruits are found, condemned. A condemned revelation may not be followed, believed, or published by the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/apparitions.htm|title=Apparitions|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/mary/apparit.htm|title=Bryan J Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bishop can judge an alleged private revelation before it ends, such as was the case with the prophecies of Montanus (condemned)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newadvent.org/fathers/250105.htm|title=Eusebius of Caesarea, Church History, Book V, Chapter 16|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the prophecies of [[Elizabeth Barton]] (approved).&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/theangelofsyonth00hamiuoft#page/26/mode/2up|title=The Angel of Syon : the life and martyrdom of Blessed Richard Reynolds, martyred at Tyburn, May 4, 1535|website=archive.org|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fraudulent visionaries sometimes counter the negative judgments of their bishops, and skeptics of authentic revelations sometimes counter positive judgments, by saying the bishops didn't do a thorough investigation, such as interviewing the visionaries.&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smwa.org/documents/Bayside_The_Facts_Revealed/Bayside_Facts_Revealed.html|title=Bayside, The Facts Revealed|website=www.smwa.org|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all reports of private revelation are approved, even if they have good fruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_x/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-x_enc_05041906_tribus-circiter_en.html|title=Tribus Circiter|author=Pius X|date=5 April 1906|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/archbishop-enters-row-over-knock-sun-miracle-1924930.html|title=Archbishop enters row over Knock 'sun miracle'|work=Independent.ie|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, reports of ''Our Lady of [[Surbiton]]'' claiming that the Virgin Mary appeared every day under a pine tree in [[England]] were flatly rejected by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] as a fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1563941/Vatican-rejects-woman's-Virgin-Mary-claim.html|title=Vatican rejects Our Lady of Surbiton|date=23 September 2007|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is permissible, with the bishop's permission, to make a [[shrine]] in honor of an approved revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4J.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no one is obligated to believe in a private revelation, since it is not public revelation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20100930_verbum-domini_en.html|title=Verbum Domini 14|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; just as no one is obligated to practice [[popular piety]], since it is not the [[liturgy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html|title=Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only public revelation and the liturgy are obligatory, for they are necessary for salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm#74|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The Transmission of Divine Revelation|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2.htm#1068|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The celebration of the christian mystery|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, some Catholics, such as the Fatima Crusaders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatimacrusader.com/consecration/tocconsecration.asp|title=Fatima Crusader|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe the [[rosary]] is necessary for world peace because [[Our Lady of Fatima]] said "Pray the Rosary every day, in order to obtain peace for the world, and the end of the war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santuario-fatima.pt/portal/index.php?id=42318|title=Santuário de Fátima - Página Oficial|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication of revelation===
On October 23, 1995 the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] clarified about private revelations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
With regard to the spreading of texts of presumed personal revelations, the Congregation makes it clear that:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. The interpretation by some people of a decision approved by Paul VI on October 14, 1966, and promulgated on November 15 of the same year, by virtue of which writings and messages coming from presumed revelations might be freely spread within the Church is absolutely not valid. This decision actually referred to the 'Abolition of the Index of Banned Books,' and said that - once relative censures were lifted - the moral obligation in any case not to spread or read those writings which endangered faith and morals still remained.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
2. A reminder, therefore, that for the diffusion of texts of presumed private revelations, the norm of the Code in force, Canon 823, para 1, which gives pastors the right 'to demand that the writings of the faithful which touch faith or morals be submitted to their own judgment before publication', remains valid.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
3. Presumed supernatural revelations and writings which regard them are in the first instance subject to the judgment of the diocesan bishop and, in particular cases, to that of the episcopal conference and the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_df96vr.htm|title=CATHOLIC LIBRARY: Communique on Vassula Ryden (1996)|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is a misconception that the faithful do not need permission to publish alleged private revelations since the abolition of Canon 1399 and 2318 of the former Canonical Code by [[Pope Paul VI]] in AAS 58 (1966) on October 14, 1966. The truth is that Pope Paul VI only abolished the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19651207_integrae-servandae_en.html|title=Pope Paul VI, Integrae Servandae|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Canon 823 and 824 of the current [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] define the right and duty of the bishop to censor all material concerning faith or morals.&lt;ref name="vatican2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2Q.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[canonization]] of a [[Christian mysticism|mystic]] or an [[imprimatur]] given to a book of revelations do not mean a private revelation is authentic, because the church does not pronounce on alleged revelations when it pronounces on the holiness of an individual&lt;ref name="Co-Patronesses of Europe"/&gt; and because the Imprimatur only guarantees that a book is free from all doctrinal and moral errors.&lt;ref name="vatican2"/&gt;

===Controversy===

Certain private revelations have been the subject of [[conspiracy theories]]. The theories include church coverups,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Last Secret of Fatima |last=Bertone |first=Tarcisio |publisher=Doubleday Religion |date= May 6, 2008 |pages=65–66|isbn=0-385-52582-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; church officials siding with the local government to destroy apparitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medjugorje.org/localbishandmed.htm|title=The Stance of the Local Bishop on Medjugorje|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; visionaries' doubles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09008b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: La Salette|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and church corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_x/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-x_enc_05041906_tribus-circiter_en.html|title=Pius X, Tribus Circiter (05/04/1906)|author=Pius X|date=5 April 1906|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes claimed that private revelations prove conspiracy theories. For instance, some UFO conspiracy theorists claim that the [[Miracle of the Sun]] was a UFO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufoseek.org/fatimajv.htm|title=This website is currently unavailable.|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rabbiofzidichov.JPG|thumb|Rebbe [[Naftali Tzvi Labin of Zidichov]]]]
'''''Rebbe''''' ({{lang-he-n|רבי}}: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|ɛ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|i}}&lt;ref name="ODoE-rebbe"&gt;Oxford Dictionary of English, Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Yiddish]] word derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''[[rabbi]]'', which means 'master', 'teacher', or 'mentor'. Like the title ''rabbi'', it refers to teachers of [[Torah]] or leaders of [[Judaism]].

In common parlance of modern times, the phrase ''the Rebbe'' is often used specifically by [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] to refer to the leader of their Hasidic movement.&lt;ref name="Heilman" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TheRebbeOnRebbe&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneerson|first=Rabbi Menachem Mendel|title=The Head|url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/letters/default_cdo/aid/66722/jewish/The-Head.htm|work=Kabbalah and the Mystical|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|access-date=25 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619001923/http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/letters/default_cdo/aid/66722/jewish/The-Head.htm|archivedate=19 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology and origin ==
The [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] term ''rebbe'' comes from the Hebrew word ''rabbi'', meaning "My Master", which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. It was an honorific originally given to those who had [[Smicha]] in the [[Pharisees|Pharisaic]] and Talmudic era. Since vowels were not written at the time, it is impossible to know historically whether it was pronounced rah-bee ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɑː|b|i}}) or r-bee ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|i}}). The English word ''rabbi'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|b|aɪ}}) comes directly from this form. In Yiddish, the word became ''reb-eh'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|ɛ}})&amp;mdash;now commonly spelled ''rebbe'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|ə}}&amp;mdash;or just ''reb'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b}}). The word ''master'' {{Hebrew|רב}} ''{{transl|he|rav}}'' {{IPA-he|ˈʁäv|}} literally means "great one".

The Sages of the Mishnah known as the ''[[Tannaim]]'', from the 1st and 2nd centuries of the common era, were known by the title ''Rabbi'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|b|i}}) (for example, [[Rabbi Akiva]] and Rabbi [[Simeon bar Yohai|Shimon bar Yochoy]]). Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the leader of Jewry in Mishnaic Times, was simply called ''Rabbi'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|b|i}}), as being the rabbi par excellence of his generation.

The Sages of the Talmud known as the ''[[Amoraim]]'', from the 3rd, 4th and early 5th centuries, those born in the [[Land of Israel]], are called ''Rabbi'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|b|i}}); those born in the [[diaspora]] are known by the title ''[[Rav]]'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɑː|v}}).

== Usage ==
{{Judaism}}
Today, ''rebbe'' is used in the following ways:
# Rabbi, a teacher of Torah – [[Yeshiva]] students or ''[[cheder]]'' (elementary school) students, when talking to their Teacher, would address him with the [[Honorifics in Judaism|honorific]] ''Rebbe'', as the Yiddish-German equivalent to the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word Rabbi ({{Hebrew|רַבִּי}} ''{{transl|he|rabi}}'' {{IPA-he|ˈʁäbi|}}).
# Personal mentor and teacher—A person's main [[Rosh Yeshiva]], Yeshiva teacher, or mentor, who teaches him or her Talmud and Torah and gives religious guidance, is referred to as ''rebbe'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|ə}}&lt;ref name="ODoE-rebbe"/&gt;), also as an equivalent to the term "rabbi".
# Spiritual leader—The spiritual head of a Hasidic movement is called a ''rebbe'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|ə}}&lt;ref name="ODoE-rebbe"/&gt;). His followers would address him as "The ''Rebbe''" or refer to him when speaking to others as "the ''Rebbe''" or "my ''Rebbe''". He is referred to by others as the ''Rebbe'' of a particular Hasidut. In Hebrew, a hasidic rebbe is often referred to as an ''[[Honorifics in Judaism#Admo.22r|AdMoR]]'', which is an abbreviation for '''''Ad'''oneinu, '''Mo'''reinu, ve'''R'''abbenu'' ("Our Master, our Teacher, and our Rabbi"). In writing, this title is placed before the name of the Hasidut, as in "Admor of Belz"; while the title ''Rebbe'' comes after the name of the ''Hasidut'' when used as an adjective, as in "Lubavitcher Rebbe", "Amshinever Rebbe", and every rebbe of every Hasidic Dynasty. In the ''[[Litvishe]]'' world, when not referring to a hasidic ''rebbe'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|ə}}&lt;ref name="ODoE-rebbe"/&gt;), the word can be pronounced "rebbee" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|i}}). Sephardic Jews can pronounce it as "Ribbi" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|b|i}}). The [[Lubavitch]]er hasidim have a tradition that the Hebrew letters that make up the word rebbe ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|i}}) are also an acronym for "'''R'''osh '''B'''nei '''Y'''isroel", meaning "a spiritual head of the [[Children of Israel]]".


An ordinary communal rabbi, or ''rebbe'' in Yiddish, is sometimes distinct from a ''[[rav]]'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|v}}, also pronounced ''rov'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɒ|v}} by Jews of Eastern European or Russian origin), who is a more authoritative [[Halakha|halakhic]] decider. A significant function of a ''rav'' is to answer questions of [[halakha]] (corpus of Jewish law), but he is not as authoritative as a ''[[posek]]''. The short form ''[[Reb (Yiddish)|reb]]'' is an [[honorific]] for [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] men, who are most likely to have profound knowledge of the Talmud and Torah, as opposed to [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Conservative Judaism]]. Originally, this title was added to the names of Jews at the time of the schism with the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite sect]], as a sign of loyalty to the original [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic tradition]], known today as [[Orthodox Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]], ''Halikhot Shlomo'' 1:370–373;&lt;br/&gt; [[Salo Wittmayer Baron]], ''A Social and Religious History of the Jews'', vol. 5 p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hasidism ==
As a rule, among hasidim, ''rebbe'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|ə}}) is referred to in Hebrew as ''admor'' (pl. ''admorim''), an abbreviation for [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]] ''adoneinu moreinu v'rabeinu'', meaning 'our master, our teacher, and our rabbi', which is now the modern Hebrew word in Israel for ''rebbe''.

Hasidim use the term ''rebbe'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|ə}}) also in a more elevated manner, to denote someone that they perceive not only as the religious leader or ''[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|nasi]]''&lt;ref name=TheRebbeOnRebbe/&gt; of their congregation, but as their spiritual adviser and mentor. ''The Rebbe'' or ''my Rebbe'' in this sense is a ''rav'' or ''rabbi'' whose views and advice are accepted not only on issues of religious law and practice, but in all arenas of life, including political and social issues. Sometimes a hasid has a ''rebbe'' as his spiritual guide and an additional ''rav'' for rulings on issues of ''halakha''.

Hasidim use the concept of a (non-hasidic) ''rebbe'' in the simple sense of ''rabbi'', as the Yiddish-German equivalent to the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word {{Hebrew|רַבִּי}} ''{{transl|he|rabi}}'' {{IPA-he|ˈʁäbi|}}. For example: "I will ask my rebbe ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|ə}}), Rabbi ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ae|b|aɪ}}) [[Ploni#Hebrew|Ploni]] (so-and-so), for advice about this personal matter."

== The hasidic rebbe {{anchor|Rebbe (Hasidism)}} {{anchor|Chasidic Rebbes}} ==
A hasidic rebbe ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|b|ɛ}}) is generally taken to mean a great leader of a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[List of Hasidic dynasties|dynasty]], also referred to as "Grand Rabbi" in English or an ''ADMOR'', a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] acronym for '''''A'''doneinu'''-Mo'''reinu-ve'''R'''abbeinu'' ("our lord/master, teacher, and rabbi"). Outside of Hasidic circles the term "Grand Rabbi" has been used to refer to a rabbi with a higher spiritual status. The practice became widespread in America in the early 1900s when Hasidic rebbes began to emigrate to the United States and was derived from the [[German language|German]] ''Grossrabbiner''.

Rabbi [[Israel ben Eliezer|Yisroel Baal Shem Tov]], the founder of Hasidism, is regarded by Hasidim as the first Hasidic rebbe.&lt;ref name="Heilman" /&gt; During his lifetime he was referred to mainly as "The holy" rather than as "Rebbe", and his disciples were "[[Maggid|magidim]]" or "preachers", such as the [[Mordechai Twersky|Magid of Chernobyl]] or the [[Magid of Mezritsh]].

The first "rebbe" to be known as such was the Baal Shem Tov's grandson, Rabbi Boruch of [[Medzhibozh (Hasidic dynasty)|Mezhibozh]], who was referred to as "The Rebbe" during his lifetime. After him, those who rose to positions of leadership and their successors began to be called ''rebbe''. The title gradually came to suggest a higher spiritual status.

Each Hasidic group refers to its leader as "the rebbe".

[[Hannah Rachel Verbermacher]], also known as the [[Maiden of Ludmir]] or the "Ludmirer Moyd", was the only female rebbe in the history of the Hasidic movement; she lived in the 19th century in Ukraine and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Maiden_of_Ludmir|title=YIVO - Maiden of Ludmir|author=|date=|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K4WylwfJNOoC&amp;dq=biography+maiden+ludmir&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Maiden of Ludmir: A Jewish Holy Woman and Her World|first=Nathaniel|last=Deutsch|date=6 October 2003|publisher=University of California Press|accessdate=1 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship of hasidim to their rebbe ===

==== Rebbe as tzadik ====
According to [[Maimonides]],&lt;ref&gt;Tractate Yevamot of the [[Babylonian Talmud]] 49b–50a: "One whose merit surpasses his iniquity is a ''tzadik''". [[Mishneh Torah]], ''Sefer Madda'', Laws of [[repentance in Judaism|Repentance]] 3:1&lt;/ref&gt; a tzadik is "one whose merit surpasses [his/her] iniquity", and every person can reach the level of a Tzadik. According to the [[Tanya]], a tzadik has no evil inclination, and only a select few predestined to attain this level can attain it. According to [[Kabbalah]] (and particularly the hasidic understanding of Kabbalah), the world is sustained on the "shoulders" of [[Tzadikim Nistarim]], divinely predestined exceptionally righteous people in a generation. Nobody has knowledge about who was such a tzaddik, even one of these exceptionally righteous people would not know that they really are such a tzadik. These people are understood to have perfected their personal service of God to such an extent that they become literally and physically aware of God. These righteous people's perception (of both spiritual and physical, not to mention temporal matters) transcends the apparent boundaries of existence.

However, a hasidic rebbe is generally said to be a righteous person, called a "[[tzaddik]]".&lt;ref name="Heilman"&gt;Heilman, Samuel. [http://www.uctv.tv/shows/The-Rebbe-and-The-Resurgence-of-Orthodox-Judaism-22631 "The Rebbe and the Resurgence of Orthodox Judaism."] ''Religion and Spirituality (Audio)''. UCTV, 20 Oct 2011. web. 31 Jul 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a rebbe is said to be able to affect divine providence, and a rebbe is said to be able to "see the future", or at least have strong insight into the life and trials of another.

As a result, hasidim in some hasidic circles seek their rebbe's advice for a variety of concerns: spiritual, physical, and even business concerns. Furthermore, many people seek the blessing ''([[Berakhah|bracha]])'' of a rebbe (and a hasid will specifically seek the blessing of his own rebbe) for anything from minor (and all the more so major) physical troubles, to grand spiritual concerns. Many famous and common stories of a rebbe's intervention involve women who successfully seek a rebbe's blessing for fertility so that they can conceive after having been barren for many years.

[[File:Moses speaks to the children of Israel.jpg|thumb|150px|Kabbalah describes an extension of [[Moses]] in each generation, alternately identified with the ''Tzadik of the generation'', and the potential [[Jewish messianism|Jewish Messiah]] of the generation. In Hasidism, each person's soul essence relates to the level of Moses.]]

==== Tzadik HaDor ====
In some movements the hasidim believe that their rebbe is the "''tzadik hador''" ([[Tzadik#The Tzadik HaDor-Tzaddik of the Generation|tzaddik of the generation]]) and would regard any thought that detracts from his perfection and holiness as heresy. Other sects lessen this idealization to some degree or another. Since many rebbes are sons-in-law or students of other rebbes, it makes sense that they would view themselves as subordinate to those other rebbes. Nonetheless, their hasidim remain loyal to them because of their special loyalty, a family connection, or a belief that a specific ''[[tzaddik]]'' or Nasi HaDor (although others might have greater spiritual stature) connects best with one's soul. For example, the [[Kosov (Hasidic dynasty)|Kosover]] Rebbe makes yearly pilgrimages to the [[Tosh (Hasidic dynasty)|Tosher]] Rebbe. Nonetheless, his followers remain very loyal to him.

==== Rebbe as conduit ====
Unlike rabbis or non-hasidic rebbes in other Jewish movements, hasidic Judaism considers a 'hasidic rebbe' to be a conduit between Jews and God.&lt;ref name="Heilman" /&gt; On the basis of traditional Kabbalistic concepts and terminology, [[Hasidic philosophy]] bridged [[deveikut]], a Jewish concept referring to closeness to God, to the hasidic rebbe, embodying and channeling the [[Ayin and Yesh|Divine flow]] of blessing to the world, because Creation is dependent on the continuous flow of Divine lifeforce, without which it would revert to nothingness.&lt;ref&gt;''God and the Zaddik as the two focal points of Hasidic worship'' Ada Rapoport-Albert, in ''Essential Papers on Hasidism'' edited by Gershon Hundert, NYU Press 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hasidic followers of a rebbe ====
Given a rebbe's physical awareness of God, and the rebbe's transcendent perception of Godliness, many hasidim take special care to observe the specific and sometimes minute practices of their rebbe. Even things that seem mundane may nonetheless be seen by hasidim as incredibly significant. For example, [[Chabad|Lubavitch]]er hasidim frequently shape their [[fedora]]s to match the way that the Lubavitcher Rebbe shaped his hat-which was more flat than many others. Many [[Skver]]er hasidim (of the Skverer Rebbe in [[New Square]]) wear their [[peyos]] identical to those of the Skverer Rebbe. While hasidim do not always follow the specific practices of their rebbe, the rebbe is able to create practices that may be specific and unique to his hasidim. For example, Rabbi Aaron Roth (''Reb Areleh'', as he was called) the first rebbe of [[Toldos Aharon|Shomer Emunim]], told his hasidim to pause frequently while eating their meals in order to keep them from overindulging. A hasid will usually love his rebbe like a close family member, if not more so. The degree and nature of this belief varies, however, depending on the movement.

=== Functions of a hasidic rebbe ===
{{Prose|section|date=September 2011}}
There are some functions which are exclusively the domain of hasidic rebbes:
* Reading ''[[kvitel|kvitlach]]''
* Running a ''[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|tish]]'' or leading a ''[[farbrengen]]''

Others are not exclusive to Hasidic rebbes, but are often an important part of their role:

* Participating in family celebrations of the hasidim, such as weddings and ''[[bris]]im'' (circumcision ceremony)
* Performing mitzvos, etc. in the presence of their hasidim, such as kindling the [[Chanuka]] lights and drawing water with which to bake [[matzo]]s
* Leading the prayers on Shabbos, Holy Days, and other special occasions
* Delivering learned or inspirational discourses (in [[Chabad]] Hasidut, this is one of the main roles of a rebbe)
* Build educational, social and religious institutions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vienna Celebrates 'the Most Influential Rabbi of Modern History'|agency=Connection Newspapers|date=May 7, 2014|location=Alexandria, VA|quote=Chabad Tysons Jewish Center will present Paradigm Shift: Transformational Life Teachings of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, a new six-session course by the Rohr Jewish Learning Institute. The course will be offered as part of a series of local activities in Northern Virginia marking 20 years since the passing of "the Rebbe", Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson of righteous memory. The Rebbe was a visionary religious leader who inspired countless individuals during his lifetime and established a global network of educational, social, and religious institutions to revive the post-holocaust Jewish landscape.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Kvitlach'' ====
{{Main article|kvitel}}
A rebbe has times when Hasidim (and other petitioners) may come for a private audience. A [[kvitel]] (Yiddish for "note", plural ''kvitlach'') is a note with the name of the petitioner and a short request for which the rebbe is asked to pray. The formula in which a person's name is written is one's own Hebrew name, the son/daughter of one's mother's Hebrew name, such as ''Shimon ben Rivkah'' (Simeon the son of Rebecca). Hasidim believe that rebbes read supernaturally "between the lines" of a ''kvitel'', and in every Hasidic movement there are numerous anecdotes relating how the rebbe saw things that were not written in the ''kvitel''. In most Hasidic groups, the ''kvitel'' is written by the rebbe's ''[[gabbai]]'' (secretary), however sometimes the petitioner writes it on his own. Usually, but with some exceptions, a ''[[pidyon]]'' (redemption) of cash is customarily handed to the rebbe under the ''kvitel'', but this is not obligatory. This is considered to be the [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] through which the blessing is given, and a redemption for the soul of the petitioner. ("A gift makes its receiver glad" is given as an explanation: a blessing only comes from a joyous heart.) It is also customary to tip the gabbai, although this too is not obligatory.

==== Tish and farbrengen ====
{{Main article|Tish (Hasidic celebration)|Farbrengen}}
[[File:bostonertischbeitar.jpg|thumb|The Bostoner Rebbe ''feert [[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|tish]]'', lit. "runs [a] table" in his synagogue in [[Beitar Illit]]]]

A rebbe conducts a ''tish'' ({{lang-yi|פֿירט טיש}}: ''feert tish'', literally, "to run [a] table") or a ''farbrengen''—a communal festive meal with highly mystical overtones—on [[Shabbat]] and other occasions. At a tish, the rebbe distributes ''shirayim'' (lit. remnants) to the Hasidim seated at or gathered round the table. When a gathering similar to a ''tish'' is led by a rabbi who is not a rebbe, it can be referred to as a ''botte'' (esp. amongst groups from Romania) or ''sheves achim''.

'''Sacred Heart Church''', in [[Dangriga]], [[Belize]], is a Roman Catholic [[Parish (Catholic Church)|parish]].

==Early contacts==
{{Main|History of Belize#Emigration of the Garifuna}}
The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] migrated to the southern shore of Belize in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name=Woods&gt;{{cite book | last =Woods, Charles M. Sr.| title =Years of Grace: The History of Roman Catholic Evangelization in Belize: 1524-2014 | publisher =Roman Catholic Diocese of Belize City-Belmopan | date =2015 | location =Belize City|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|315}} Their womenfolk cultivated the rich alluvial river banks while the men were fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jesuitarchives.org/belize-mission-collection Pictures of Garifuna culture in Belize, from early 20th century]&lt;/ref&gt; Preceding them to Stann Creek town (later Dangriga) were some Black [[Afro-Belizean|Creoles]] and a few whites who were served by [[Anglican]] and [[Methodist]] [[missionary|missionaries]]. In 1834 these missionaries built a chapel for the Garifuna in Stann Creek. There was then a cumulative population of about 500 in Stann Creek and the closely associated town of [[Mullins River]] ten miles to the north that had already become a focus of Catholic missionary activity.&lt;ref name=John&gt;{{cite book | last =Johnson| first =W.R.| title =A history of Christianity in Belize: 1776-1838|publisher =University Press of America| date =1985 | location = Lanham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181}}

The first evidence that a Catholic priest had been in Stann Creek comes from 1830.&lt;ref&gt;“Armstrong to WMMS.” (November 19, 1830). In {{cite book | last=Johnson| first=W.R.| title =A history of Christianity in Belize: 1776-1838|publisher =University Press of America| date =1985 | location =Lanham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Jeffries, a Methodist minister, said that the Garifuna wore “makeshift [[prayer beads|beads]] and [[Christian cross|crosses]] to ward off evil and danger, a practice they explained as an inheritance from earlier instruction by Spanish priests.”&lt;ref name=John/&gt; Mullins River with its colony of immigrant [[mestizo]]s from [[Honduras]] remained the more important [[Holy Redeemer Catholic Parish, Belize City|Catholic mission]] until 1867.

In 1862 [[Jesuit]] Fr. Genon was covering Stann Creek from [[Punta Gorda, Belize|Punta Gorda]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, F.C. (1897). ''Historical Sketch of the Catholic Mission in British Honduras 1851–1893''. Belize: The Angelus Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1867 Jesuit Fr. Brindisi built the first Catholic rectory and church in Stann Creek. In 1871 he built a better church “with pillars and naves and a goodly size”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Murphy| first =W. J.|location=Retrieved at Jesuit Archives|title =The Catholic Church in British Honduras, A Compilation|date=December 1930|pages=20| url=http://jesuitarchives.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had the assistance of a [[diocesan]] missionary priest Leon Maclluchet from 1874 to 1879. In 1877 Fr. Alfonso Parisi replaced Fr. Brindisi. He built a school in Stann Creek and a new chapel at Mullins River.&lt;ref&gt;Pittar, John. (October 1874). ''Woodstock Letters &amp; Notices'', '''10''', pages 145-162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1874, Jesuit Fr. Pittar described the Garifuna congregation as “remarkably gentle and docile in their conduct … and not a little superstitious.” One superstition he referred to was the belief that spirits of the dead communicate with the living, the [[dugu ceremony]] or “spiritualism.” For decades into the 20th century the church and government tried to stamp out this custom.&lt;ref&gt;“A Pastoral Visitation to Stann Creek.” (April 17, 1904). ''The Daily Clarion'', pages 323-325.&lt;/ref&gt; But it has endured with mutual influence: the cross and statues of the [[Virgin Mary]] might be placed on the altar in the Dubuyaba, and the Buyei encourage attendance at Christian church services, especially for thanksgiving. Garifuna priests now regard this cultural tradition favorably. The Catholic [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] has been translated into Garifuna and has been enculturated, as displayed at the annual celebration of [[Garifuna Settlement Day]] each November 19.

==Prominence==

In 1890 a contingent of Catholics from each of the districts, about 300 strong, gathered at Sacred Heart Church in Stann Creek for the consecration of the [[Apostolic prefect|Prefecture]] to the [[Sacred Heart]], a devotion that had come to flourish in the colony. A grand parade with banners and bands processed through town along with Prefect [[Salvatore di Pietro]] and the members of the Catholic Association.&lt;ref&gt;''The Angelus''. (January 1890).&lt;/ref&gt; This all-inclusive event created a future pattern for cultural harmony at Catholic [[liturgy|liturgies]]. It would no longer be the mestizo or Creole or Garifuna church or the church of the elite but the church of all the people.&lt;ref&gt;''National Studies: A Journal of Social Research and Thought''. (May 1974), '''3''', #3. Belize City: St. John’s College.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1890s, Dangriga had a population of 3965 of whom about 3000 were Catholic. The church building could accommodate 800.

==Education==
In 1894 in Stann Creek, beginning in standard 6, the best students received extra classes to enable them to teach in the primary schools, especially in the rural areas. Graduates who were able and willing were hired for a pittance to help in the primary schools of their communities while preparing to qualify as certified teachers. The Garifuna took well to learning and would be essential to the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Belize#Apostolic works|educational efforts]] of the Catholic church in Belize. In 1897 the [[Sisters of the Holy Family (Louisiana)|Sisters of the Holy Family]] arrived from [[New Orleans]] principally to serve in Stann Creek.

==Long-standing pastors==
[[File:KofB1910.png|thumb|right|Jesuit Fr. Lynam with Catholic Knights of Belize c. 1910]]
In 1903 Fr. Joe Lynam replaced Joe Rigge as pastor and remained until 1910. In six years Lynam recorded 541 baptisms, 242 marriages, and 310 deaths. Also serving at this time were Spanish Jesuit Matthew Antillach (1893–1910) and Fr. Edmond Coony (1904–1918; 1921–1929). Following him was Fr. Michael Schaefer (1929–1935). In 1931 Stann Creek welcomed its first native priest, Fr. Sebastian Arjonilla.&lt;ref&gt;“Stann Creek’s First Priest.” (October 1931). ''Jesuit Missions'', pages 199, 218.&lt;/ref&gt; While John Knopp served as pastor (1941–1945; 1954–1957), a plague of locusts destroyed people’s crops (1941) and a hurricane destroyed two schools. Then in January 1942 a fire completely destroyed the church and convent.&lt;ref&gt;"Fourth fire in five years – Stann Creek church and convent completely destroyed". (March 1942). ''Jesuit Missions'', page 213.&lt;/ref&gt; The present church building was built in 1954. In 1945 Robert  McCormack became pastor in Stann Creek. In 1953 he helped open Lynam College nine miles outside of town, which for 18 years served as the country’s only agricultural college, closing in 1971. There followed the pastors William Thro 1963–1970, who built a new rectory, Howard Oliver 1970–1980, and James Short 1981–1989 who had recruited the [[Sisters of Charity of Nazareth]] for Belize in 1975 to assist with pastoral ministry at Sacred Heart.&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|179}} The involvement of the laity was formalized into a Lay Ministry Program for Sacred Heart Parish that, in 1980, saw 37 men and women begin the year-long process of preparation. This increased the self-confidence level of lay ministers, as they conducted prayer and [[Eucharist|Communion]] services in rural areas and took Communion to the sick.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, M.R. (2003). ''We drank the water: Nazareth in Belize.'' Prospect, KY: Harmony House, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 Garifuna [[Osmond P. Martin]] was ordained to the priesthood in his home parish of Sacred Heart in Stann Creek. He would become the first native bishop of Belize in 1983.

[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|300px|Major denominations and religions of the world]]
A '''sect''' is a subgroup of a [[religion|religious]], [[politics|political]], or [[philosophy|philosophical]] belief system, usually an offshoot of a larger group. Although the term was originally a classification for religious separated groups, it can now refer to any organization that breaks away from a larger one to follow a different set of rules and principles.

In an [[India]]n context, sect refers to an organized tradition.&lt;ref name="sai.uni-heidelberg"/&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Catalogue of Sects.GIF|thumb|right|280px|''A Catalogue of the Severall Sects and Opinions in England and other Nations: With a briefe Rehearsall of their false and dangerous Tenents''. Broadsheet. 1647]]
The word ''sect'' comes from the [[Latin]] noun ''secta'' (a feminine form of a variant past participle of the verb ''sequi'', to follow&lt;ref name=oel_sect&gt;
{{cite web
| url         = https://www.etymonline.com/word/sect#etymonline_v_23088
| title       = sect (n.)
| work        = [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]
| publisher   = [[Douglas Harper]]
| accessdate  = 2018-11-03
| quote       = mid-14c., "distinctive system of beliefs or observances; party or school within a religion," from Old French secte, sete "sect, religious community," or directly from Late Latin secta "religious group, sect in philosophy or religion," from Latin secta "manner, mode, following, school of thought," literally "a way, road, beaten path," from fem. of sectus, variant past participle of sequi "follow," from PIE root *sekw- (1) "to follow." Confused in this sense with Latin secta, fem. past participle of secare "to cut" (from PIE root *sek- "to cut"). Meaning "separately organized religious body" is recorded from 1570s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), meaning "a way, road", and figuratively a (prescribed) way, mode, or manner, and hence [[metonym]]ously, a discipline or school of thought as defined by a set of methods and doctrines. The present gamut of meanings of ''sect'' has been influenced by confusion with the [[homonym]]ous (but etymologically unrelated) Latin word ''secta'' (the feminine form of the past participle of the verb ''[[Wikt:secare|secare]]'', to cut).&lt;ref name=oel_sect/&gt;

==Sociological definitions and descriptions==
{{Main article|Church-sect typology}}
There are several different sociological definitions and descriptions for the term.&lt;ref name="available online"&gt;McCormick Maaga, Mary excerpt from her book ''Hearing the Voices of [[Jonestown]]'' (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1998) [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=16596  available online]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first to define them were [[Max Weber]] and [[Ernst Troeltsch]] (1912).&lt;ref name="available online"/&gt; In the [[church-sect typology]] they are described as newly formed religious groups that form to protest elements of their parent religion (generally a [[Religious denomination|denomination]]). Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of apostasy or [[heresy]] in the parent denomination; they are often decrying liberal trends in denominational development and advocating a return to true religion. The American [[sociology|sociologists]] [[Rodney Stark]] and [[William Sims Bainbridge]] assert that "sects claim to be authentic purged, refurbished version of the faith from which they split".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark|Stark, Rodney]], and Williams Sims Bainbridge (1979) ''Of Churches, Sects, and Cults: Preliminary Concepts for a Theory of Religious Movements'' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 18, no 2: 117–33&lt;/ref&gt; They further assert that sects have, in contrast to churches, a high degree of tension with the surrounding society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark|Stark, Rodney]], and [[William Sims Bainbridge]] (1985) ''The Future of Religion: Secularization, Revival, and Cult formation'' Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists of religion such as Fred Kniss have asserted that sectarianism is best described with regard to what a sect is in tension with.  Some religious groups exist in tension only with co-religious groups of different ethnicities, or exist in tension with the whole of society rather than the church which the sect originated from.&lt;ref&gt;Kniss, Fred, and Numrich, Paul (2007) ''Sacred Assemblies and Civic Engagement''Rutgers University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sectarianism]] is sometimes defined in the [[sociology of religion]] as a worldview that emphasizes the unique legitimacy of believers' creed and practices and that heightens tension with the larger society by engaging in boundary-maintaining practices.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, Meredith B. "Religion: the Social Context" fifth edition (2002) {{ISBN|0-534-54126-7}} page 338&lt;/ref&gt;

The English sociologist [[Roy Wallis]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eileen Barker|Barker, E]]. ''New Religious Movements: A Practical Introduction'' (1990), Bernan Press, {{ISBN|0-11-340927-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that a sect is characterized by "[[epistemology|epistemological]] authoritarianism": sects possess some authoritative locus for the legitimate attribution of heresy. According to Wallis, "sects lay a claim to possess unique and privileged access to the truth or salvation" and "their committed adherents typically regard all those outside the confines of the collectivity as 'in error'". He contrasts this with a [[cult]] that he described as characterized by "epistemological individualism" by which he means that "the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member."&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''[[The Road to Total Freedom A Sociological analysis of Scientology]]'' (1976) [http://whyaretheydead.net/krasel/books/wallis/wallis1.html available online (bad scan)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405052348/http://whyaretheydead.net/krasel/books/wallis/wallis1.html |date=2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''Scientology: Therapeutic Cult to Religious Sect'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614094446/http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/1/89 abstract only] (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other languages==
The corresponding words for "sect" in [[Europe]]an languages other than [[English language|English]] – ''Sekte'' (German), ''secte'' (French), ''secta'' (Spanish, Catalan), ''sectă'' (Romanian), ''seita'' (Portuguese, Galician), ''sekta'' (Polish, Czech, Slovak, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian, Latvian, Lithuanian), ''sekt'' (Danish, Estonian, Norwegian, Swedish), ''sekte'' (Dutch) and ''szekta'' (Hungarian), ''секта'' (Russian, Serbian, Bulgarian) – refer to a harmful religious sect and translate into English as "[[Cult|cult]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In [[France]], since the 1970s, ''secte'' has a specific meaning{{which|date=October 2014}} which is very different from the English word.&lt;ref&gt;Esquerre Arnaud, "Lutter contre les sectes: l’invention d’un psycho-pouvoir", ''Le Banquet'', n°24, février 2007, p. 199-212&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quote|date=October 2014}}

==In Buddhism==
{{Main article|Schools of Buddhism}}
[[File:Japanese buddhist monk by Arashiyama.JPG|thumb|Japanese buddhist monk from the [[Sōtō Zen]] sect]]
The ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Religion'' distinguishes three types of classification of Buddhism, separated into "Movements", "Nikāyas" and "Doctrinal schools":
* Schools:
** [[Theravada]], ''primarily in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]].''
** [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]], ''primarily in [[East Asia]].''
** [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]], ''primarily in [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Mongolia]] and the Russian republic of [[Kalmykia]].''
* [[Nikāya]]s, or monastic fraternities, three of which survive at the present day:
** [[Theravada|Theravāda]], in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]]
** [[Dharmaguptaka]], in [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]
** [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]], in the Tibetan tradition

==In Christianity==
{{see also|List of Christian denominations|Christian denomination}}
While the historical usage of the term "sect" in [[Christendom]] has had [[pejorative]] connotations, referring to a group or movement with [[Christian heresy|heretical]] beliefs or practices that deviate from those of groups considered orthodox,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan R. Wilson|Wilson, Bryan]] ''Religion in Sociological Perspective'' 1982, {{ISBN|0-19-826664-2}} [[Oxford University Press]] page 89&lt;br&gt;
"In English, it is a term that designates a religiously separated group, but in its historical usage in Christendom it carried a distinctly pejorative connotation. A sect was a movement committed to heretical beliefs and often to ritual acts and practices like isolation that departed from orthodox religious procedures."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Sect and Sects}}&lt;/ref&gt; its primary meaning is to indicate a community which has separated itself in some way from the larger body from which its members came and to which they may or may not still adhere. The term remains valid for this purpose.

===Roman Catholic sects===
There are many groups outside the Roman Catholic Church which regard themselves as Catholic, such as the [[Community of the Lady of All Nations]], the [[Palmarian Catholic Church]], the [[Philippine Independent Church]], the [[Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church]], the [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God]], [[Most Holy Family Monastery]], and others.

===Protestant sects===
{{See also|List of the largest Protestant denominations}}

==In Hinduism==
{{Main article|Hindu denominations}}
[[File:Ganapati.1..JPG|thumb|[[Ganesha]] worshippers]]
The [[Indology|Indologist]] [[Axel Michaels]] writes in his book about [[Hinduism]] that in an Indian context the word "sect does not denote a split or excluded community, but rather an organized tradition, usually established by founder with ascetic practices."&lt;ref name="sai.uni-heidelberg"&gt;{{cite book | title = Hinduism past and Present (2004) translated from German "Der Hinduismus" (1998)| first=Axel| last=Michaels| author-link=Axel Michaels| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn=0-691-08952-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michaels, "Indian sects do not focus on heresy, since the lack of a center or a compulsory center makes this impossible – instead, the focus is on adherents and followers."&lt;ref name="sai.uni-heidelberg"/&gt;

==In Islam==
{{Main article|Islamic schools and branches|fiqh|madhhab}}
The ancient schools of [[fiqh]] or [[sharia]] in [[Islam]] are known as "[[madhhab]]s." In the beginning Islam was classically divided into three major sects. These political divisions are well known as [[Sunni Islam]], [[Shia Islam]] and [[Khawarij|Khariji Islam]]. Each sect developed several distinct jurisprudence systems reflecting their own understanding of the Islamic law during the course of the [[history of Islam]].

For instance, Sunnis are separated into five sub-sects, namely, [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Ẓāhirī]].

The Shia, on the other hand, first developed [[Kaysanites|Kaysanism]], which in turn divided into three major groupings known as [[Fivers]], [[Seveners]] and [[Twelvers]]. The [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydis]] separated first. The non-Zaydis are initially called as "[[Rafida]] Groups." These [[Rafidi]]s were later divided into two sub-groups known as [[Imamiyyah]] and [[Batiniyyah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmed Cevdet Pasha]], ''Kısas-ı Enbiyâ,'' vol. II, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The "[[Imami]]-[[Shi'a]]" later brought into existence [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]]. [[Akhbari]]sm, [[Usuli]]sm, and [[Shaykhism]] were all ensued as variations of "Ja'fari fiqh," while [[Alawites]] and [[Alevis]] who are not the strict followers of "Ja'farism" are developed separately from the teachings of ''[[Ithna'ashari]] [[Imām]]s.''[[File:Ghardaia02.jpg|thumb|[[M'zab]] valley in Sahara is home of the [[Ibadi]] religious sect]]
*[[Batiniyya]] groups, on the other hand, were divided into two sub-groups known as [[Sevener]]s and [[Ismā'īlī]]s. [[Qarmatians]] who did not follow the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] were branched from the [[Seveners]]. Those groups of [[Batiniyya]] who followed the [[Fatimids]] are the ancestors of today's [[Ismā'īlī]]s. [[Druze]] was emerged as an offshoot of Ismāʿīlism at the beginning of the 11th Century. [[Isma'ilism]] at the end of the 11th Century split into two major branches known as [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]] ''([[Assassins]] of [[Alamut]])'' and [[Musta’li Ismaili]]. As a result of the assassination of [[Fatimid Caliph]] [[Al-Amir bi-Ahkami'l-Lah]], [[Mustaali]] was once more again divided into [[Hafizi]]s and [[Taiyabi Ismaili]]s ''([[Dawoodi Bohra|Dawoodis]], [[Sulaymani]]s and [[Alavi Bohra|Alavis]])''
* The Khawarij were initially divided into five major branches: [[Sufri]]s, [[Azariqa]], [[Najdat]], Adjarites and [[Ibadi]]s.

The Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali Sunnis, the Twelver groups, the Ismā'īlī groups, the Zaydis, the Ibadis, and the Ẓāhirīs continue to exist. In addition, new sects like [[Ahmadiyya movement]], [[Islam in the United States#Black Muslim movements|Black Muslim movements]], [[Quranists]], [[Salafis]], [[Wahhabis]], and [[Zikris]] have been emerged independently.

=== Amman Message ===
{{main article||Amman Message}}
{{further information|Islamic denominations}}
An Islamic convention held in [[Jordan]] in July 2005, which brought 200 Muslim scholars from over 50 countries together, announced the official recognition of eight [[Madhhab|schools]] of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ammanmessage.com/ The Amman Message summary] – Official website&lt;/ref&gt; and the varying [[schools of Islamic theology]].&lt;ref name="3Points"&gt;[http://ammanmessage.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=91&amp;Itemid=74 The Three Points of The [[Amman Message]] V.1]&lt;/ref&gt; The eight recognized [[List of Islamic schools and branches|Islamic schools and branches]] are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3070">'''Sehajdhari Sikh Party''' (SSP), formerly known as '''Sehajdhari Sikh Federation''' (SSF), is a [[political party]] registered under section 29(A) of the Representation of the People Act 1951 by the [[Election Commission of India]]. It claims to be the world's first organization that represents the [[Sahajdhari]] [[Sikh]]s. Dr. Paramjeet Singh Ranu is the founder National President of the Party.].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-04-20/chandigarh/28327518_1_sehajdhari-sikh-federation-ssf-sikh-community Sehajdhari Sikhs back Cong]. The Times of India, 20 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==

SSP aims to spread the teachings and principles of [[Guru Nanak Dev]] and the other [[Sikh Gurus]] with the preaching of [[Guru Granth Sahib]], to "spread the Message of Peace worldwide". It also aims to "prevent the fascist forces to divide the religion or the nation on caste basis".

== History  ==

Sehajdhari Sikh Federation was formed on 13 April 2001 by holding Ardas at Gurudwara Tahliana Sahib Raekot by certain likeminded secular persons especially those Sikhs who were born in Sikh families, when resolutions were passed by [[SGPC]] to disfranchise the voting right of Sehajdhari Sikhs in SGPC elections. Firstly the organization was registered under the Society Act at [[Ludhiana]] and then on November 4, 2001, the Federation held a large congregation of thousands of Sehajdhari Sikhs before [[Akal Takht]] at [[Amritsar]] and held Ardas by turning the Sehajdhari Sikh Federation into a political out fit and named it as Sehajdhari [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] SSAD.

Later an application was filed with the Election Commission of India for getting the organization registered as a Political Party under section 29(A) of the Representation of the People Act 1951. The Akali Dals in Punjab opposed the name “Sehajdhari Shiromani Akali Dal” and the Election Commission directed to change the words ‘Shiromani’ and ‘Akali’ from the title. As the word ‘AKALI’ means ‘KHALSA’(Amritdhari) and Sehajdharis are not Khalsa hence the old name was selected by the National Council of the Organisation and the Election Commission of India registered the name of “Sehajdhari Sikh Federation” as a Political Party under section 29(A) of the Representation of People Act 1951.Now the Election commission has approved the change of name of the Party as SEHAJDHARI SIKH PARTY (SSP).

The Party has been contesting a legal battle in the Punjab &amp; [[Haryana]] High Court for the voting right of Sehajdhari Sikhs in the SGPC elections which was existing since 1959 and was disfrenchised in 2003 by a notification. The High Court quashed the notification and revived the voting rights of sehajdhari sikhs.The SGPC filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the High Court Verdict and the matter is under adjudication.

'''Serankulam''' or '''Serangulam''' or '''Serangolam''', is a village in [[Mannargudi]] Taluk of [[Thiruvarur]] District in [[Tamil Nadu]] in [[India]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tiruvarur District Mannargudi Block|url=http://www.tiruvarur.tn.nic.in/mngblk.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serangolam is about 5 kilometers from Mannargudi and can be reached by buses, auto-rickshaws and a mini-bus. Serangolam is roughly about 330 kilometers from Chennai.

==Religious Significance==
In the [[Tamil culture|Tamil]] [[Srivaishnava]] tradition, Serangolam (aka, Serankulam, Serangulam) is one of five villages collectively known as [[Panchagramam]]. The other villages are Karappangadu, Nammankurichi, Peravoorani and Puliyakkudi (Idaikkadu).

===Oral tradition about Panchagramam===
Once upon a time, a group of Srivaishnavas from Kooram, Kidambi and Selperi (near Kanchipuram) set off on a pilgrimage. One nightfall, they stopped at the place now known as Karappangadu. That night, they had a dream in which the Lord directed them to an anthill (marked by a flying Garuda) in which they were to find a deity. The Lord directed the Srivaishnavas to build a temple and chant the Divya Prabhandam for HIM. Thus, the town of Karappangadu was formed. As days went by, the families from Karappangadu settled in the near-by areas. They got settled in Peraavoorani, Nammankurichi, Puliyakkudi, and Serangolam - these came to be called "The Panchagramams" (meaning: "The 5 villages") along with Karappangaadu.

==Temple==
[[File:Srinivasa-Perumaal.jpg|thumb]]
Serangolam has a temple dedicated to Lord Srinivasa, located on the banks of the river Paamani, a branch of Cauvery until it unites with Bay of Bengal in the town of Muthupettai.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5475">{{Theravada Buddhism}}
A '''siladhara''' is a [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhist]] female monastic established by [[Ajahn Sumedho]] at [[Chithurst Buddhist Monastery]], [[England]].{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2007}}  In 1983, he obtained permission from the Sangha in Thailand, to give a [[Five Precepts#Ten Precepts|ten-precept]] ''[[pabbajja]]'' to the women, making them officially recognized female renunciants trained in the [[Ajahn Chah]] lineage. The reasons for its establishment are due to the historical loss of the [[bhikkhuni]] (nun's) ordination in Theravada Buddhism, limiting renunciation for female Theravadins to ad-hoc roles such as the [[thilashin]]s and [[maechi]]s, neither of which garner respect from the Theravada community as genuine renunciates.

==History==
Ajahn Sumedho enlisted [[Ajahn Sucitto]] to train the nuns from 1984 to 1991. By 2008, siladharas were trained in the discipline of more than one hundred precepts, including rules based on the [[patimokkha]] of the [[bhikkhuni]] order. The order waxed and waned throughout its brief history, peaking at around 14, mostly living at [[Amaravati Buddhist Monastery]].

==Status==
The siladhara order is formally considered a community junior to that of the [[bhikkhu]] order of fully ordained men. Over the last twenty years, many siladhara have therefore sought full bhikkhuni ordination with commensurate privileges, recognition and responsibilities enjoyed by male monastics. Making full ordination available to women a cultural issue with significant implications for the welfare of young girls living in poverty in Asian countries where Theravada Buddhism is prevalent, especially [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and [[Sri Lanka]].{{sfn|Diab|2012|p=62}} Speaking of Thailand, Lynne Hybels writes, "Young men in desperately poor families such as those in [[Chiang Rai (city)|Chiang Rai]] can bring honor to their families by becoming monks, but girls are expected to provide financially. Traffickers understand this vulnerability, prey on it, and easily lure girls into life in the brothel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hybels|first1=Lynne|title=Protecting the Innocent|journal=Sojourners|url=https://sojo.net/magazine/may-2014/protecting-innocent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Five Point Declaration==
After years of debate and dispute, Ajahn Sumedho issued a "Five Point Declaration" concerning women's roles and rights in the Amaravati monastic community.&lt;ref&gt;http://west-wight-sangha.blogspot.com/2010/03/more-on-nun-ordinations-at-amaravati.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://forestsangha.org/community/news/where-we-are-now|title = Where We Are Now|date = 19 November 2009|work = Forest Sangha News|accessdate = 12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affirmed the traditional privileges and seniority of bhikkhus over female monastics. The edict holds that while some teaching and management responsibilities are shared between the two orders according to capability, the siladhara order is unequivocally junior to that of the monks.

The "Five Point declaration" is considered to be discriminatory against women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leighb.com/nuns.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://awakeningtruth.org/blog/?p=38&lt;/ref&gt; Some monastics and scholars also consider it to be an inaccurate interpretation of the [[Vinaya]] and other texts&lt;ref&gt;https://sujato.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/the-five-points/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/2013/06/24/the-revival-of-the-bhikkhuni-order-and-the-decline-of-the-sasana/&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] in the [[United States Constitution ]] or other codified examples of discrimination such as [[coverture]]. Many female monastics living at Amaravati at the time left the monastery citing discrimination and an inaccurate understanding of compassion on the part of Amravati leadership.&lt;ref name="Ground Between"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Thannisara Mary|title=Ground Between|url=http://bhikkhuni.net/present/spring2010/present-groundbetween-spring2010.pdf|work=Present Magazine|publisher=Alliance for Bhikkhunis|accessdate=September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726221253/http://www.bhikkhuni.net/present/spring2010/present-groundbetween-spring2010.pdf|archivedate=2010-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several siladharas from this group founded a community in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://saranaloka.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Along with numerous other women in recent years, these former siladharas have taken full bhikkhuni ordination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Bhikkhuni_ordination&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bhikkhuni.net/news/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Silvius''', or '''Sylvius''', ([[Latin]]: ''Silvǐus''; [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Σιλούιος''; said to have reigned 1139-1110 BC),&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] ''Roman Antiquities'' 1.70&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Silvius Postumus''',&lt;ref&gt;Neil Wright [https://books.google.com/books?id=XIWbo1BfzkIC&amp;lpg=PR100&amp;ots=qEXpgBITmH&amp;dq=Silvius%20Postumus&amp;pg=PR100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Historis regum Britannie by Geoffrey of Monmouth II The First Variant Edition: a critical edition'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schedel, Hartmann 1440-1514 [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=nur;cc=nur;view=text;idno=nur.001.0004;rgn=div2;node=nur.001.0004%3A6.7 ''The Nuremberg Chronicle''] Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Digital Collections Center
2010&lt;/ref&gt; was either the son of [[Aeneas]] and [[Lavinia]] or the son of [[Ascanius]].  He succeeded [[Ascanius]] as King of [[Alba Longa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil|Vergil]] ''[[Aeneid]]'' 6.763-766&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the former tradition, upon the death of Aeneas, Lavinia is said to have hidden in a forest from the fear that [[Ascanius]] would harm the child. He was named after his place of birth, ''Silva'' being the Latin word for forest or [[wood]].

According to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a dispute arose on who should succeed Ascanius, either Silvius (the brother of Ascanius) or Iulus (the son of Ascanius).&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'' 1.70&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was decided in favor of Silvius by the people who believed that it was his right as the grandson of Latinus. Julus was awarded the [[priest]]hood. All the kings of Alba following Silvius bore the name as their [[cognomen]].

His son, [[Aeneas Silvius]], was also king of Alba Longa, and his other son, [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]], was the first king of [[Great Britain|Britain]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3818">{{Korean shamanism}}
'''Sungmo''' (崇母, "Holy Mother"), also called '''Daemo''' ("Great Mother"), '''Jamo''' ("Benevolent Mother"), '''Sinmo''' ("Divine Mother"), '''Nogo''' ("Ancient Lady"), '''Chungkyun Moju''' ("Empress Mother of the Rightful View") and by other names,{{sfnb|Lee|2010s|pp=6–7}} is a [[mother goddess]] in [[Korean shamanism]]. She is regarded as the mother or daughter of the [[Haneullim|Heavenly King]] and, in some myths, as the mother of all shamans. In other myths, the shamans are rather explained as descendants of [[Dangun]].{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=13}}

==Relation to the shamans==
In a collection of myths, the origin of the shamans is linked to Sungmo, who is associated with a mountain and presented as either the mother or the spiritual daughter of the "Heavenly King". In some myths, she is a mortal princess who is later [[apotheosis|turned into a goddess]]. The investiture of the shamans, according to such myths, is believed to pass down through female lineage.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=5–12}}

These myths usually tell of a man, Pobu Hwasang, who encountered the "Holy Mother [of the Heavenly King]" on the top of a mountain.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=5–6}} The Holy Mother then became a human being and married the man who met her, giving birth to eight girls, the first ''mudang''.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=5–6}} According to some scholars, this myth was first elaborated in the [[Silla]] period, when [[Buddhism]] and influences from [[China]] had already penetrated the Korean peninsula.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|pp=5–6, 13}}

The myth of the princess is the most popular, and it differs from region to region.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=6}} In one of the versions, the princess is Ahwang Kongju of the Yao kingdom, located on the Asian mainland.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=6}} The princess had a strong link with divinity, granting welfare to her people.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=6}} Her father sent the princess among the people, whom began to worship her for her healing powers.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}} The first ''mudang'' were established as her successors.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}} The princess is worshipped with seasonal offerings in [[Chungcheong]].{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}} The yellow and red clothes worn by the ''mudang'' are regarded as Ahwang Kongju's robes.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}}

In the north of the Korean peninsula the princess is known as ''Chil Kongju'' (the "Seventh Princess"), seventh amongst the daughters of the king.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}} The myth tells that she was rejected by her father, who sealed her in a stone coffin and casted it in a pond, but she was rescued by a [[Dragon King]] sent by the Heavenly King, and ascended to the western sky becoming the goddess of healing waters.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}} Names of the goddess in other local traditions ''Pali Kongju'' and ''Kongsim''.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=7}} In the tradition of [[Jeju Island]], where there are more male ''baksu'' than female ''mudang'', the myth tells of a prince as the ancestor of all shamans.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=12}}

The '''Tabon Caves''', dubbed as the ''Philippines' Cradle of Civilization,''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.pia.gov.ph/index.php?article=711344239637|title = Tabon Cave in Palawan declared Nat'l Cultural Treasure|date = August 7, 2012|accessdate = September 2, 2014|website = |publisher = Philippine Information Agency|last = Mendoza|first = Victoria Asuncion}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a group of caves located on Lipuun Point, north of [[Quezon, Palawan|Quezon]] municipality, in the south western part of the province of [[Palawan]] on [[Palawan Island]], in the [[Philippines]]. They are part of the Lipuun Point Reservation, which has been protected by the government of the Philippines as a museum reservation to protect the caves and immediate vicinity from deforestation and to preserve the cultural artifacts present there.&lt;ref name="NationalMuseumWebsite"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tabon Cave Complex|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/ASBMD/Tabon.html|website=National Museum|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The caves are named after the [[Tabon scrubfowl]]. It is bordered on the south by the town proper of Quezon, Bgy. [[Panitian]] on the west, and the [[West Philippine Sea]] on the north and east. Out of 215 known caves, 29 have been explored and seven  of these are open to the public. The seven  include Tabon, Diwata, Igang and Liyang Caves.  One of the oldest human bones found in the Philippines, the [[Tabon Man]],  was found here in 1962.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cavingnews.com/20120808-philippine-cave-declared-national-cultural-treasure|title = Philippine Caves Declared National Cultural Treasure|date = August 8, 2012|accessdate = September 4, 2014|website = Caving News|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other excavated, unexamined remains are stored onsite. In 2006, the ''Tabon Cave Complex and all of Lipuun'' was added to the tentative list of the Philippines for future [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] nomination.

The complex is managed by the [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]]&lt;ref name="council"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcsd.ph/photo_gallery/wonders/Tabon%20Cave%20%20profile.htm |title=Tabon Caves: Site of an important Philippine archaeological discovery |accessdate=1 February 2009 |publisher=Palawan Council for Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was declared as a National Cultural Treasure by the same institution in February 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://loqal-explorer/tabon-cave-in-palawan-a-national-treasure/?post=1850|title = Tabon Cave in Palawan: A national treasure|date = August 15, 2014|accessdate = September 4, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological discoveries ==
[[File:Manunggul Jar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Manunggul Jar|Manunggul burial jar]].]]
The caves were researched by Dr. [[Robert B. Fox]] and a team from the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] between 1962 and 1966.&lt;ref name="NationalMuseumWebsite" /&gt; The greatest find of was the skull cap of the [[Tabon Man]].  It is believed to be approximately 22,000-24,000 years old.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="council" /&gt; The team found over 1,500 burial jars.  One jar in particular, the [[Manunggul Jar]], is considered to be a National Cultural Treasure. Other finds included earthenware, jade ornaments and jewelry, many stone tools, animal bones, and human fossils dating back to 47,000 years ago, the earliest human remains found in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1860/ |title=The Tabon Cave Complex and all of Lipuun |accessdate=1 February 2009 |date=16 May 2006 |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological finds indicate habitation from 50,000 to 700 years ago.  The limestone formations in the reservation date back 25 million years to the Lower Middle Miocene Period.

The Lipuun Point Reservation, covering a {{convert|138|ha|abbr=on}} island connected to the Palawan mainland by a mangrove forest, was declared a Site Museum Reservation in April 1972 and was made a priority site for tourism development in 1991 for its natural and cultural heritage.

In recent years, verification of facts in addition to further analysis of previously collected samples has allowed for a greater understanding of the site as a whole. Radioisotope dating techniques have been able to show a period of near continuous habitation from 30,000-9,000 years ago. Human remains as well as rock flakes, hammers, and other stone tools indicate the cave may have been used as a workshop.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"&gt;{{cite web |jstor=10.1086/342432 |title=Notes on the Morphology and Age of the Tabon Cave Fossil Homo sapiens |date=October 2014 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bone fragments found in the caves have been suggested to have been from the late Pleistocene to early Holocene periods.&lt;ref name="JSTOR" /&gt; Previous excavations of the site have also revealed evidence of a diet including pig and deer, which are extinct in the Philippines today.

While little new data is available because of the cave's location and safety concerns, they are slowly being excavated and the old data is being reexamined.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}  Approximately 25% of archaeological sites in the caves have been excavated.&lt;ref name="NationalMuseumWebsite" /&gt;

== Cave use ==
Earliest cave uses included inhabitation, and the factory like production of stone tools. According to a video by Dr. Fox, a jar burial period began 3000 years ago and lasted until 1500 years ago. This is evidence the area became dominated by people known as the [[Sa Huỳnh culture]].&lt;ref name="Cham"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140616-south-china-sea-vietnam-china-cambodia-champa/ |title=The Cham: Descendants of Ancient Rulers of South China Sea Watch Maritime Dispute From Sidelines |accessdate=29 June 2015 |date=18 June 2014 |publisher=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sa Huynh adorned their dead with agate, carnelian, and glass beads from India and Iran.&lt;ref name="Cham" /&gt; Artifacts of this nature, including glass bracelets, were found in the cave and are displayed at the Palawan Cultural Museum in Puerto Princesa.

A migration of Sa Huyhn people to [[Vietnam]] is accepted by most experts to have been the forebears of the [[Cham people]].&lt;ref name="Cham" /&gt; These are a people still existing today that created an empire known as Champa.

History of the people in the area took on a new significance in modern times owing to the [[Spratly Islands dispute]].

A gold Ornamental Pendant, from the Tabon caves in the island of Palawan, is an image of [[Garuda]], the eagle bird who is the mount of [[Hindu]] deity [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name=TabonGaruda&gt;[http://www.oocities.org/lppsec/pp/palawan.htm Palawan Tabon garuda]&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon caves has been linked to those found from [[Óc Eo]] archaeological site in [[Thoại Sơn District]] in southern [[An Giang Province]] of [[Vietnam]] in the [[Mekong River Delta]].&lt;ref name=atnb&gt;Anna T. N. Bennett (2009), [http://archeosciences.revues.org/2072 "Gold in early Southeast Asia"], ''ArcheoSciences'', Volume 33, pp 99-107&lt;/ref&gt; These archaeological evidence suggests an active trade of many specialized goods and gold between [[India]] and Philippines and coastal regions of Vietnam and China.

==Igang Cave Findings==
Igang is one of the upper caves and one of the longest of the complex.  It appears to have been the primary burial site and most of the burial jars were found here.

==Tabon Cave wall findings==
Tabon Cave lends its name to the complex as a whole.  In this large cave with a big open chamber, researchers found artifacts indicating trade with China during the [[Song Dynasty]] and the [[Yuan Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tabon Cave Complex and all of Lipuun|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1860/|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centere|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are now at the Philippine National Museum in Manila.

==College of Tabonology==
In July 2015, [[Holy Trinity University]] in Puerto Princesa, Palawan was selected for the construction of a new college to studies of ancient Palawan man (Tabonology).&lt;ref name="pn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palawan-news.com/htu-named-as-research-center-for-ancient-palawan/   |title=HTU named as research center for ancient Palawan man |author=Joy Tabuada|date=16 July 2015|publisher=Palawan News|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nearly all active research stopped after Dr. Fox died.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Security measures==
The National Museum of the Philippines carefully guards the cave complex.  All visitors are watched to ensure they take nothing but pictures and do not damage the cave walls.  Further, all burial jars and remains have been secured.

One issue is that new research and exploration of the complex has largely ceased.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

'''''The Late, Great Planet Earth''''' is a best-selling 1970 book by [[Hal Lindsey]] with [[Carole C. Carlson]], and first published by [[Zondervan]]. The book was adapted by [[Rolf Forsberg]] and Robert Amram&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079445/fullcredits#writers{{unreliable source|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; during 1976 into a film narrated by [[Orson Welles]] and released by [[Pacific International Enterprises]]. It was originally ghost-written by Carlson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scionofzion.com/ghost_writers.htm |title=The Scandal of Christian Ghostwriting |last1=Marrs |first1=Texe |date= |work=scionofzion.com |publisher= |accessdate=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom later printings credited as co-author. Lindsey and Carlson later published several sequels, including ''Satan Is Alive and Well on Planet Earth'' and ''The 1980s: Countdown to Armageddon''.

==Antichrist in the 1970s, Rapture in the 1980s==
''The Late, Great Planet Earth'' is a treatment of literalist, [[Premillennialism|premillennial]], [[Dispensationalism|dispensational]] [[eschatology]]. As such, it compared [[End time|end-time]] prophecies in the [[Bible]] with then-current events in an attempt to predict future scenarios resulting in the [[rapture]] of believers before the [[tribulation]] and [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus|Christ]] to establish his thousand-year (i.e. millennial) Kingdom on Earth.  Emphasizing various passages in the books of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], Lindsey originally suggested the possibility that these climactic events might occur during the 1980s, which he interpreted as one generation from the foundation of modern [[Israel]] during 1948, a major event according to some conservative evangelical schools of eschatological thought. Cover art of the Bantam edition suggested that the 1970s were the "era of the [[Antichrist]] as foretold by [[Moses]] and Jesus," and termed the book "a penetrating look at incredible ancient prophecies involving this generation."  Descriptions of alleged "fulfilled" prophecy were offered as proof of the infallibility of God's Word, and evidence that "unfulfilled" prophecies would soon find their denouement in God's plan for the planet.
 
He cited an increase in the frequency of [[famine]]s, [[war]]s and [[earthquake]]s, as major events just prior to the end of the world. He also foretold a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion of Israel ([[War of Ezekiel 38–39|War of Gog and Magog]]). Lindsey also predicted that the [[European Economic Community]], which preceded the [[European Union]], was destined (according to Biblical prophecy) to become a "[[United States of Europe]]", which in turn he says is destined to become a "Revived [[Roman Empire]]" ruled by the Antichrist. Lindsey wrote that he had concluded, since there was no apparent mention of America in the books of Daniel or Revelation, that America would not be a major geopolitical power by the time the tribulations of the end times arrived. He found little in the Bible that could represent America, but he suggested that [[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Ezekiel#Chapter 38|Ezekiel 38:13]] could be speaking of America in part.

Although Lindsey did not claim to know the dates of future events with any certainty, he suggested that [[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 24|Matthew 24:32-34]] indicated that Jesus' return might be within "one generation" of the rebirth of the state of Israel, and the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple, and Lindsey asserted that "in the Bible" one generation is forty years. Some readers accepted this as an indication that the Tribulation or the Rapture would occur no later than 1988. In his 1980 work ''The 1980s: Countdown to Armageddon'', Lindsey predicted that "the decade of the 1980s could very well be the last decade of history as we know it".

''The Late, Great Planet Earth'' was the first Christian prophecy book to be published by a secular publisher (Bantam, 1973) and sell many copies.  Despite some dated content, 28 million copies had sold by 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Bart D. Ehrman, MDiv, PhD. [http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/historical-jesus.html Historical Jesus.

'''''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross: A Study of the Nature and Origins of Christianity Within the Fertility Cults of the Ancient Near East''''' is a 1970 book about the [[linguistics]] of early [[Christianity]] and [[fertility cult]]s in the [[Ancient Near East]]. It was written by [[John Marco Allegro]] (1923–1988).&lt;ref name="FlintVanderKam2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Flint, Peter  |author2=VanderKam, James  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA324 |year= 2005 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-567-08468-2 |pages=324–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AllegroIrvin2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Allegro, John M.  |author2=Irvin, J. R.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross: A Study of the Nature and Origins of Christianity Within the Fertility Cults of the Ancient Near East |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFsSQgAACAAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Gnostic Media Research &amp; Publishing |isbn=978-0-9825562-7-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
The book relates the development of language to the development of myths, religions, and cultic practices in world cultures. Allegro argues, through etymology, that the roots of [[Christianity]], and many other religions, lay in [[fertility cult]]s, and that cult practices, such as ingesting [[entheogen|visionary plants]] to perceive the mind of God, persisted into the early [[Christian]] era, and to some unspecified extent into the 13th century with reoccurrences in the 18th century and mid-20th century, as he interprets the fresco of the [[Plaincourault Chapel]] to be an accurate depiction of the ritual ingestion of ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' as the [[Eucharist]]. Allegro argued that Jesus never existed as a historical figure and was a mythological creation of early [[Christian]]s under the influence of [[psychoactive]] mushroom extracts such as [[psilocybin]].&lt;ref name="FlintVanderKam2005"/&gt;

His claims have often been subject to ridicule and scorn due to Allegro's unconventional theory. As ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine put it in an article headed "Jesus as mushroom",&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909327,00.html "Religion: Jesus as Mushroom"], ''Time'', 8 June 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To some biblical scholars in Britain, the new book looked like the psychedelic ravings of a hippie cultist. To others, it was merely an outlandish hoax. One described it as reading "like a Semitic philologist's erotic nightmare".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reaction==
The book has been described as ''"notorious"'' and as ''"one of the strangest books ever published on the subject of [[religion]] and [[pharmacology]]"''.&lt;ref name="Taylor2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=Taylor, Joan E. |title=The Essenes, the Scrolls, and the Dead Sea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWIMFY4VnI4C&amp;pg=PA305 |year= 2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-955448-5 |pages=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a [[media frenzy]] when it was published at the dawn of the 1970s. This caused the publisher to apologize for issuing it and forced Allegro's resignation from his university position.&lt;ref name="FlintVanderKam2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Judith Anne |title=John Marco Allegro: The Maverick Of The Dead Sea Scrolls |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXHf8qdq9kYC&amp;pg=PA291 |year=2005 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |isbn=978-0-8028-2849-1 |pages=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Anne Brown suggested that the book was ''"difficult to read and difficult to summarize, because he follows clues that criss-cross different cultures and lead into many-layered webs of association"''.&lt;ref name="Brown2005"/&gt; Mark Hall writes that Allegro suggested the scrolls all but proved that a historical Jesus never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Mark. "Foreword", in Allegro, John M. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls &amp; the Christian Myth''. Prometheus 1992, first published 1979, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Jenkins writes that Allegro was an eccentric scholar who relied on texts that did not exist in quite the form he was citing them, and calls the ''Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'' "possibly the single most ludicrous book on Jesus scholarship by a qualified academic".&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Philip (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv6x5kTHGvsC&amp;pg=PA180 "Hidden Gospels"]. Oxford University Press, p. 180, {{ISBN|0195156315}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconsideration==
Some studies of Allegro's work have given new purported evidence and led to calls for his theories to be re-evaluated by the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Michael (2006) [http://www.egodeath.com/WassonEdenTree.htm "Wasson and Allegro on the Tree of Knowledge as Amanita"]. ''Journal of Higher Criticism''.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009 ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'' was reprinted in a 40th anniversary edition with 30-page addendum by Prof. [[Carl A. P. Ruck]] of [[Boston University]].&lt;ref&gt;Allegro, John M. (2009) ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'', 40th anniversary edition, Gnostic Media, {{ISBN|978-0-9825562-7-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A more articulate exposition of Allegro's insights into early Christianity and his discoveries studying the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] was published in his 1979 book ''[[The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth]]''.

The work of Allegro also gained recognition and consideration by such late proponents of experiential psychedelia through pharmacological interaction as [[Terence McKenna]], who cited Allegro's claims of certain psychoactive fungi analogizing the [[Eucharist]], spoken in a live lecture in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Brown2005"/&gt;

'''''There is No Natural Religion''''' is a series of philosophical [[aphorism]]s by [[William Blake]], written in 1788. Following on from his initial experiments with [[William Blake#Relief etching|relief etching]] in the non-textual ''[[The Approach of Doom]]'' (1787), ''[[All Religions are One]]'' and ''There is No Natural Religion'' represent Blake's first successful attempt to combine image and text via relief etching, and are thus the earliest of his [[illuminated manuscript]]s. As such, they serve as a significant milestone in Blake's career; as [[Peter Ackroyd]] points out, "his newly invented form now changed the nature of his expression. It had enlarged his range; with relief etching, the words [[Epigraphy|inscribed]] like those of God upon the tables of law, Blake could acquire a new role."&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd (1995: 115–116)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relief etching==
[[File:The Ghost of Abel (page 2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|left|Page 2 of ''The Ghost of Abel'' (1822); note the writing in the colophon at bottom right.]]
In 1822, Blake completed a short two-page dramatic piece which would prove to be the last of his illuminated manuscripts, entitled ''[[The Ghost of Abel|The Ghost of Abel A Revelation In the Visions of Jehovah Seen by William Blake]]''. Inscribed in the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] of this text is "W Blakes Original [[Stereotype (printing)|Stereotype]] was 1788". It is almost universally agreed amongst Blakean scholars, that the "Original Stereotype" to which he here refers was ''All Religions are One'' and/or ''There is No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Bindman (1978: 468), Erdman (1982: 790); Ackroyd (1995: 115)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1770s, Blake had come to feel that one of the major problems with reproducing artwork in print was the division of labour by which it was achieved; one person would create a design (the artist), another would [[Engraving|engrave]] it (the engraver), another [[Printing|print]] it (the printer) and another [[Publishing|publish]] it (the publisher).&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 10)&lt;/ref&gt; It was unusual for artists to engrave their own designs, due primarily to the [[social status]] attached to each job; engraving was not seen as an especially exalted profession, and was instead regarded as nothing more than mechanical reproduction.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"/&gt; Artists like [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] and [[John Hamilton Mortimer]] were the exceptions to the norm insofar as they tended to engrave their own material.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"/&gt; A further division in the process was that text and images were handled by different artisans; text was printed by means of a movable [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]], whereas images were engraved, two very different jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 41)&lt;/ref&gt;

During Blake's training as a professional copy engraver with [[James Basire]] during the 1770s, the most common method of engraving was [[stippling]], which was thought to give a more accurate impression of the original picture than the previously dominant method, [[line engraving]]. [[Etching]] was also commonly used for layering in such aspects as landscape and background.&lt;ref&gt;Bindman (1978: 12)&lt;/ref&gt; All traditional methods of engraving and etching were [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]], which meant that the design's outline was traced with a needle through an acid-resistant 'ground' which had been poured over the copperplate. The plate was then covered with acid, and the engraver went over the incised lines with a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] to allow the acid to bite into the furrows and eat into the copper itself. The acid would then be poured off, leaving the design incised on the plate. The engraver would then engrave the plate's entire surface with in a web of [[Hatching|crosshatched lines]], before pouring the ink onto the plate and transferring it to the [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 37)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated with this method, Blake seems to have begun thinking about a new method of publishing at least as early as 1784, as in that year a rough description of what would become relief etching appears in his unpublished satire, ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''. Around the same time, [[George Cumberland]] had been experimenting with a method to allow him to reproduce handwriting via an etched plate, and Blake incorporated Cumberland's method into his own relief etching; treating the text as handwritten script rather than mechanical letterpress, and thus allowing him to make it a component of the image.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 13)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake's great innovation in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, parts of the plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid about a quarter of an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above the rest of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern [[rubber stamp]]. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;The exact method is described in great detail in Joseph Viscomi, ''Blake and the Idea of the Book'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), chapters 4 and 18&lt;/ref&gt; This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio.&lt;ref&gt;See Bindman (1978), Bindman (2000) and Viscomi (2003) for more specific information.&lt;/ref&gt; The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he [[Mirror writing|wrote in reverse]].&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 43)&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 13)"/&gt;

Blake could also colour the plates themselves in coloured inks before pressing them or tint them with [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] after printing. Because of this aspect, a major component of relief etching was that every page of every book was a unique piece of art; no two copies of any page in Blake's entire ''oeuvre'' are identical. Variations in the actual print, different colouring choices, repainted plates, accidents during the acid bath etc., all led to multiple examples of the same plate.

Blake himself referred to relief etching as "printing in the infernal method, by means of corrosives [...] melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid."&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' (1790); Plate 6&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary description of the method was provided by Blake's friend, [[John Thomas Smith (engraver)|J.T. Smith]]; "writing his poetry, and drawing his marginal subjects of embellishments in outline upon the copper-plate with an impervious liquid, and then eating the plain parts or lights away with [[Nitric acid|aquafortis]] considerably below them so that the outlines were left as Stereotype."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bindman (1978: 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

Relief etching was the same basic method used for [[woodcut]]ting, and copper relief etching had been practised in the early 18th century by [[Elisha Kirkall]], but Blake was the first to use such a method to create both words and designs mixed together on the same plate.&lt;ref name="Bindman 1978: 14"&gt;Bindman (1978: 14)&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the unique aesthetic effects possible, a major advantage of relief etching was that Blake could print the material himself. Because the text was in relief, the pressure needed for printing was constant, unlike in intaglio printing, where different pressures were needed to force the paper into the furrows, depending on size. Additionally, intaglio etchings and engravings were printed with great pressure, but in relief etching, because the printed material was a raised surface rather than incised lines, considerably less pressure was required.&lt;ref&gt;Bindman (2000: 7)&lt;/ref&gt; As such, relief etching tackled the problem of the division of labour of publishing. Blake's new method was autographic; "it permitted—indeed promoted—a seamless relationship between conception and execution rather than the usual divisions between invention and production embedded in 18th-century print technology, and its economic and social distinctions among authors, printers, artists and engravers. Like drawings and manuscripts, Blake's relief etchings were created by the direct and positive action of the author/artist's hand without intervening processes".&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 9)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake served as artist, engraver, printer ''and'' publisher.

==Copies==
Bibliographically, ''No Natural Religion'' is one of the most complex and ambiguous of all of Blake's illuminated manuscripts. What is known for certain is that there were two printing sessions; one in 1794, and one in 1795, when a large paper copy was printed as part of a deluxe edition of Blake's collected illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref name="TNR Intro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=nnr&amp;java=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003052211/http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=nnr&amp;java=yes |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 October 2006 |title=Introduction |author= |date= |work=There is No Natural Religion |publisher=[[William Blake Archive]] |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''There is No Natural Religion'' was etched in 1788, whether Blake had printed it prior to 1794 is unknown. However, the fact that it is not mentioned in his 'To the Public' address of October 1793, where he listed all of his extant manuscripts up to that time except ''All Religions'' and ''No Natural Religion'', would suggest he had not.&lt;ref name="TNR Intro"/&gt;

The 1794 printing consists of 87 known impressions of a total of twelve plates. These impressions comprise the majority of Copy A ([[British Museum]]), Copy B ([[Yale Center for British Art]]), Copy C ([[Library of Congress]]), Copy D ([[Houghton Library]]), Copy G ([[Morgan Library &amp; Museum]]) and Copy M ([[Victoria and Albert Museum]]). All 87 impressions of the twelve plates have been colour printed in reddish-brown ink on the same type of paper. However, only Copy G (reproduced below) contains impressions of all 12 plates, although this copy was not assembled by Blake himself, but by [[John Linnell]], after Blake's death, using unbound leaves found amongst Blake's possessions.&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 22)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it was once thought that impressions from the 1794 print made up the majority of plates in Copy E, Copy F, Copy H, Copy I, Copy J and Copy K. However, in 1993, Joseph Viscomi proved that all but five of the plates in these copies are imitations. Copy E, Copy J and Copy K are composed entirely of imitations. Copy F and Copy H have two original impressions each, and the rest are imitations. Copy I has one original plate (a9; reproduced below as Plate a9 from Copy G is damaged). Viscomi believes the imitations may have been commissioned by the publisher [[Basil M. Pickering]] in the early 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph Viscomi, ''Blake and the Idea of the Book'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), chapters 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1795 printing, there is only one known set of impressions (Copy L), now held in the Morgan Library. However, although this second printing also contains 12 plates (with one missing), only four plates from the 1794 print were reprinted. The remaining seven plates are known only in this single impression. The black ink framing lines in Copy L are thought to have been added at a later date, possibly in 1818, just prior to when Blake gave the plates to John Linnell. It has been suggested that the framing lines may have been added due to the discrepancy between the size of the plates and the size of the paper (each plate is roughly 5.4 x 4&amp;nbsp;cm.; each page is 37.8 x 27&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 21)&lt;/ref&gt; In all copies other than Copy L, the plates are roughly 14 x 11&amp;nbsp;cm.

In numerous cases in both the 1794 print and the 1795 print, it seems as if the acid has eaten away too much of the relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and [[Wash (painting)|wash]], often touching the text and design outlines with pen.&lt;ref name="Bindman 1978: 14"/&gt; This ink and wash work may have been executed in 1818, along with the addition of the frame lines, although this cannot be ascertained for certain.&lt;ref name="TNR Intro"/&gt; Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of [[Woodcut#White-line woodcut|white line engraving]], a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.

All known copies of ''No Natural Religion'' were assembled from loose plates sold anonymously at [[Sotheby's]] on April 29, 1862, to [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Richard Monckton Milnes]], and as such, there is no definitive order (except where the plates are numbered).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/copy/nnr.b?descId=nnr.b.illbk.01 |title=Copy Information |author= |date= |work=There is No Natural Religion |publisher=The William Blake Archive |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this lack of definitive order however, the sequence of the plates from the 1794 print is generally agreed to be the frontispiece, followed by the title page, then the Argument, then the plates numbered I–VI, followed by the plates reprinted in 1795.  The order of the twelve plates from the 1795 print is generally agreed to be the frontispiece, followed by the title page, then the plates numbered I–VII, followed by the Conclusion, Application and the 'Therefore' plate. Traditionally, Blakean scholars tended to place the Conclusion after the Application, but since Mary Johnson and John E. Grant in 1979, this has been reversed.&lt;ref&gt;See Mary Johnson and John E. Grant, ''Blake's Poetry and Designs'' (New York: Norton, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the original 1794 and 1795 printings, the text of ''There is No Natural Religion'' was not published until 1886, in a facsimile edition edited by [[William Muir]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentley and Nurmi (1964: 61)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series a and Series b==
In 1886, William Muir attempted to impose an order on the various plates, but his efforts were not universally accepted.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 468)"/&gt; More successful was [[Geoffrey Keynes]]' attempt in 1971, and many of his decisions are still followed by modern editors.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Keynes most important, and controversial, editorial choice was to rigidly divide the two printing sessions into two distinct series', which came to be known as Series a and Series b. Specifically, he used the later addition of the framing lines in Series b (i.e. the 1795 print) to help him establish that Series as distinct from Series a (i.e. the 1794 print).&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 468)"/&gt;

In Keynes' reordering, Series a comprises eight plates, one of which is missing (Plate a2 (title page); this is because the title page from the 1794 print is actually a version of the title page from the 1795 print, and as the title is thought to suit Series b better than Series a, it tends to be designated Plate b2 and assigned to Series b). Keynes also assigned the three plates from 1794 which were reprinted in 1795 to Series b, designating them b3, b4 and b12. As such, Series b comprises eleven plates, with at least one plate missing (Plate b5; III). In 1978, David Bindman suggested that there are more plates missing from Series b than just Plate 5, as he argued that the last three plates (Application, Conclusion and 'Therefore') are thematically isolated, suggesting more missing plates which should come after Plate b8 (VII).&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 468)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 468)&lt;/ref&gt; Bindman also saw the missing title page from Series a as important, arguing that although Series a was printed with the same title plate as Series b, there is no direct evidence that ''There is No Natural Religion'' is actually the correct title of Series a; "''There is No Natural Religion'' would seem to be the title of Series b, and its content would be compatible with such a title; but there would then be no reason why Series a should have the same title."&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 468)"/&gt;

Keynes' editorial decisions have been supported by most scholars since 1971, and editors of Blake's collected work in particular tend to adhere to the division into two distinct series'; for example, [[Alicia Ostriker]]'s ''William Blake: The Complete Poems'' (1977), David Bindman's ''The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake'' (1978), [[David V. Erdman]]'s 2nd edition of ''The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake'' (1982), and Bindman's 2nd edition of ''The Illuminated Blake: William Blake's Complete Illuminated Works'' (1992), and ''The Complete Illuminated Books of William Blake'' (2003).

==One series or two?==
However, Keynes' theories have not been accepted by all Blakean scholars. For example, in ''Blake's Illuminated Books, Volume 3: The Early Illuminated Books'' (1993), Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick and Joseph Viscomi argue that the two Series are one, and the only difference between the 1794 and 1795 prints is that the 1794 print is an abridged version of the whole, and only the second half of the work was printed in 1795. They argue that "the existence of only one title, as well as the ''c.''1794 abridgement containing plates from both groups, suggest that the work was etched not as two separate Series but as a single work arranged into two parts, the second answering the first."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 24–25)&lt;/ref&gt; If this is correct, Series a cannot stand alone, as the [[irony]] found within it is only revealed when it is contrasted with Series b and thus, were it to be interpreted alone, "Blake would have appeared to contemporary readers as an advocate of the very position he is attacking."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 25)"&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 25)&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been accepted by several modern editors of Blake's work, such as W.H. Stevenson in the 3rd edition of ''Blake: The Complete Poems'' (2007).

An important component of Keynes' theory was that the three plates from the 1794 print reprinted in 1795, formed a part of Series b, not Series a. However, if they are included with Series a (such as in Bindman's ''The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake''), they come at the end; plates numbered I &amp; II to refute the theories of the previous plates, followed by the 'Therefore' plate to bring the work to a close. As such, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi argue that the 1794 print represents a twelve plate abridgement (the twelve plates are a1, a2/b2, a3-9, b3-4 and b12). They argue that "the b-series plates provide a brief but bold refutation of the [[Empiricism|empirical]] and [[Materialism|materialist]] principles offered on the preceding pages and indicate the irony with which Blake offers the first group of aphorisms."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt; They especially argue that the abridgement theory is supported by plates a9 and b3, which is the crossover point from irony to refutation. Plate a9 depicts a prone figure with his head on the right, whereas plate b3 is a mirror image, a figure with his head on the left; "this visual reversal complements the sudden change of philosophical perspective in the accompanying text."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 23)"&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 23)&lt;/ref&gt; The plates are also ideologically in direct opposition; they both deal with perceptions and organs of sense, but whereas a9 asserts that man can experience through such organs only, b3 states that this is patently false, and perceptions can go beyond organs of sense. Plate b4 elaborates on this theory, and plate b12 fulfils the prophecy of what will happen "when we know more." Thus the series forms a coherent, if brief, statement. As to the question of why Blake omitted the rest of the plates, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi argue that plates b6-11 deal with issues which thematically wouldn't fit into the abridgement—hence the 1794 print represents a streamlined version of the overall thesis; "a statement on the empiricist theory of perception followed by its direct and forceful rebuttal."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 23)"/&gt;

A major question related to the 1795 print is why did Blake only print Series b (or under Eaves, Essick and Viscomi's terms, the second half of the overall work). There are two possibilities. Perhaps he did print the entire work, but Series a (i.e. the first half) was lost. The second theory is that he may have printed only Series b as he wanted it to exist as a companion to the 1795 print of ''All Religions''; "the decision to delete the first sequence may have been motivated by a desire to create an eleven-page companion to ''All Religions are One'', a work in ten plates. Both are positive statements of Blake's principles; the presence of the ironic first sequence of propositions from ''There is No Natural Religion'' would have come between and disrupted the symmetrical relationship between the companion works."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 24)&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this theory is the fact that Copy L of ''No Natural Religion'' was printed on the same paper and in the same ink as the only existing copy of ''All Religions'', and also has the same framing lines.

Taking all of this into consideration, it is possible, however tentative, to suggest what the original appearance of the overall work may have been when first etched in 1788. Eaves, Essick and Viscomi propose the following order:
* Plate a1 (frontispiece with elderly couple and shepherds)
* Plate a2 (title page)
* Plate a3 (The Argument)
* Plate a4 (I. "Man cannot conceive...")
* Plate a5 (II. "Man by his reasoning power alone...")
* Plate a6 (III. "From a perception...")
* Plate a7 (IV. "None could have...")
* Plate a8 (V. "Mans desires are limited...")
* Plate a9 (VI. "The desires and perceptions...")
* Plate b3 (I. "Mans perceptions are not bounded...")
* Plate b4 (II. "Reason or the ratio...")
* Plate b5 (III. Untraced plate)
* Plate b6 (IV. "The bounded is loathed...")
* Plate b7 (V. "If the many become...")
* Plate b8 (VI. "If any could desire...")
* Plate b9 (VII. "The desires of Man being Infinit...")
* Plate b10 (Conclusion)
* Plate b11 (Application)
* Plate b12 ('Therefore')
* Plate b1 (full plate design usually treated as a frontispiece to Series b)
Although it is possible that plate b1 served as a divider between the two series, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi believe it was a tailpiece to the overall work. In that position it would mirror the only other full plate design (the frontispiece). Also the graphical content would suggest it as a tailpiece, as it returns to the [[gothic architecture]] of the title page. It also serves as an illustration of plate b12 ('Therefore') insofar as it depicts a [[resurrection]] where we become as God is; "the work therefore ends with its most hopeful and religious concept, the restoration of humanity to spiritual life"&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 25)"/&gt; insofar as "the plate holds out the promise of a resurrection from the 'death' of [[John Locke|Lockean]] philosophy and into the life of the [[spirit]]."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 40–41)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
Until 1971, most editors tended to consider ''All Religions are One'' as later than ''There is No Natural Religion''. For example, in his 1905 book ''The poetical works of William Blake; a new and verbatim text from the manuscript engraved and letterpress originals'', [[John Sampson (linguist)|John Sampson]] places ''No Natural Religion'' prior to ''All Religions'' in his 'Appendix to the Prophetic Books'. However, in 1971, Geoffrey Keynes argued that ''All Religions are One'' was the earlier of the two, based on what he saw as its "greater technical imperfection."&lt;ref name="Erdman (1982: 789)"&gt;Erdman (1982: 789)&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1978 book, ''The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake'', David Bindman initially disagreed with Keynes, arguing that the imperfections in ''All Religions'' are not because of an earlier date of composition, but because of the increased complexity of the plates, with such complexity demonstrating Blake growing in confidence from the more rudimentary plates for ''No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 468)" /&gt; Most scholars however support Keynes, and ''All Religions are One'' precedes ''There is No Natural Religion'' in almost all modern anthologies of Blake's work; for example, Alicia Ostriker's ''William Blake: The Complete Poems'' (1977), David V. Erdman's 2nd edition of ''The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake'' (1982), Morris Eaves', Robert N. Essick's and Joseph Viscomi's ''Blake's Illuminated Books, Volume 3: The Early Illuminated Books'' (1993), even Bindman's own ''The Complete Illuminated Books of William Blake'' (2003), and W. H. Stevenson's 3rd edition of ''Blake: The Complete Poems'' (2007).

Further evidence for Keynes hypothesis is discussed by Eaves, Essick and Viscomi, who, in counterpoint to Bindman, see the style of ''No Natural Religion'' as more confident than that of ''All Religions''. They especially cite the use of upright [[Latin alphabet|roman lettering]] in ''All Religions'' contrasted with the [[Italic script|italic]], [[cursive]] writing on several plates of ''No Natural Religion''; italic text "was easier to execute since it required fewer independent strokes. And since the resulting dense matrix of lines provided better support for the inking dabber, italic permitted a shallower etch."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 12)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake introduced italic script on plate a3 of ''No Natural Religion'', a script which he would use throughout the 1790s.&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt; Other evidence for an earlier dating of ''All Religions'' is that many of the individual letters themselves lean to the left, unlike in ''No Natural Religion''. This was a common problem in mirror writing, and its presence in ''All Religions'' but not ''No Natural Religion'' suggests Blake was only learning how to overcome it as he worked.

==Content==
When analysing ''No Natural Religion'' it is important to remember that the images are not necessarily literal depictions of the text; "the philosophical propositions [...] offer little visual imagery or even named objects. These qualities may have determined the relative independence of many of the designs from the accompanying text. The links are thematic and metaphoric, not direct and literal."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

The dog may carry the symbolic association that Man's organic perceptions are no better or different than animals', i.e. if Man limits himself to his organic senses and adheres to the principals of Empiricism, he is no different, or better, than a mere animal; it is only by the acceptance of the spiritual and the imagination, faculties unavailable to animals and unique to Man, that he can rise above a strictly physical existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/copy/nnr.c?descId=nnr.c.illbk.04 |title=Copy C, object 4 |author= |date= |work=There is No Natural Religion |publisher=The William Blake Archive |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake would return to this concept in the [[Planographic printing|planographic print]] ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (Blake)|Nebuchadnezzar]]'' (''c.''1795/1805).

==Interpretation==
One of the most immediately obvious aspects of the two series' is how they fundamentally contradict one another. In Series a, Blake explicitly states that Man is purely physical and limited to that physicality; "Naturally he is only a natural organ subject to sense", and he "cannot naturally Perceive. But through his natural or bodily organs." Because of this, Man can only understand that which he has already encountered (i.e. he cannot understand something he has not encountered, because to do so would involve faculties beyond the physical senses); Man "can only compare &amp; judge of what he has already perceiv'd." Man cannot even extrapolate new comprehensions by combining old ones; "From a perception of only 3 sense or 3 elements none could deduce a fourth or fifth." Thus, because man is limited by organic physicality ("None could have other than natural or organic thoughts if he had none but organic perceptions"), both his thoughts and his desires are so limited; "Mans desires are limited by his perceptions. none can desire what he has not perceiv'd." As such, "The desires &amp; perceptions of man untaught by any thing but organs of sense, must be limited to organs of sense." Overall, Series a serves as a declaration of extreme empiricism, which goes much further than any of the empiricist theorists ever took it.

Series b however, completely refutes the basic concepts of empiricism. It begins by declaring that "Mans perceptions are not bounded by organs of perception, he perceives more than sense (thou' ever so acute) can discover." As such, Man can indeed discover aspects beyond his own immediate experience; "Reason or the ratio of all we have already known. is not the same as it shall be when we know more." Blake points out that Man is fundamentally desirous of discovering more and moving beyond the bounds of his specific physicality, which is nothing more than a restriction; "The bounded is loathed by its possessor." As a result, Man yearns to know that which he does not yet know because "Less than all cannot satisfy Man." However, Man should never desire more than he can possess, because "if any could desire what he is incapable of possessing, despair must be his eternal lot." However, because Man tends to desire the infinite, thus "the desire of Man being Infinite the possession is Infinite &amp; himself Infinite." That is to say, if Man can only desire what he can possess, yet he desires the infinite, then he must be able to possess the infinite. Blake takes from this that if Man's desires and possessions can be infinite, then Man too must be Infinite, and, by extension, Man can see the Infinite. Indeed, ''not'' to see the Infinite is a perversion of Man's true nature, as defined by the Poetic Genius; "If it were not for the Poetic or Prophetic character. the Philosophic &amp; Experimental would soon be at the ratio of all things &amp; stand still, unable to do other than repeat the same dull round over again"; i.e. Man is made to do more than perceive and experience through the senses only. Furthermore, to see the Infinite is to see God, which is to transcend the sensate ("the Ratio"); "He who sees the Infinite in all things sees God. He who sees the Ratio only sees himself only." Therefore, for Man to see God, he must be as God, and as such, "God becomes as we are that we may be as he is."

David Bindman summarises ''There is No Natural Religion'' as "an early and fundamental statement of [Blake's] philosophical beliefs, expressed in the rational language of [[Age of Enlightenment|18th-century philosophers]]."&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 468)"/&gt; In line with this way of thinking, S. Foster Damon suggests that "the first series states John Locke's philosophy of the five senses until it becomes self-evidently absurd."&lt;ref name="Damon 1988: 402"/&gt;  A similar conclusion is reached by Denise Vultee, who argues that both ''All Religions are One'' and ''There is No Natural Religion'' are "part of Blake's lifelong quarrel with the philosophy of [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and Locke. Rejecting the rational empiricism of 18th-century [[deism]] or "natural religion", which looked to the material world for evidence of God's existence, Blake offers as an alternative the [[Imagination|imaginative faculty]] or "Poetic Genius"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org//exist/blake/archive/biography.xq?b=biography&amp;targ_div=d3&amp;targ_pict=1&amp;render=text |title= Illuminated Printing and other Illustrated Books, 1789-1792 |author= Denise Vultee  |date= |work=William Blake (1757–1827) |publisher=The William Blake Archive |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, ''No Natural Religion'' is a "mockery of rationalism and an insistence on Man's potential infinitude."&lt;ref&gt;Ostriker (1977: 877)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as well as attacking the theories of empiricism, Blake also engages with the concept of natural religion. [[Northrop Frye]] argues that "[[Theology]] distinguishes between "natural" and "revealed" religion, the former being the vision of God which man develops with his fallen reason, and the later the vision communicated to him by inspired prophets. To Blake, there is no natural religion. The only reason people believe in it is because they are unwilling to believe in the identity of God and Man."&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1947: 44)&lt;/ref&gt; For Harold Bloom, because Blake is able to see the identity of God and man, the rejection of Locke and the tenets of deism makes way for a system in which "to see the infinite in all things is to see God because it is to see as God sees, which Blake believes is the only way to see God. But to see as God sees, man must himself be infinite, a state to be attained only by the individual utterly possessed by the Poetic character."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, "Commentary" in Erdman (1982: 895)&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, "there is no natural religion, according to Blake, because no man reasoning from fallen nature can come to see that "the real man, the imagination" and God are the same. Religion must be "revealed" in the sense that Revelation means the consuming of natural appearance by a more imaginative vision."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (1982: 894)&lt;/ref&gt; Along these same lines, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi argue that, for Blake, natural religion is a "contradiction in terms antithetical to religious belief. Natural religion is derived from experience provided by the fallen senses, not from the Poetic Genius. Thus it is not a religion and cannot be included in the 'all' of ''All Religions are One''."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 31)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Blake's ironic treatment of empirical doctrines and natural religion, a key element introduced in Series b is desire; "the rational mind, merely a mechanical manipulation or "ratio" of sense experience, "shall be" transformed as spiritual enlightenment advances and we discover more than "organic perceptions" allow.&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 32)"/&gt; If it were not for desires reaching beyond the sensate, Man would be trapped in a self-imposed empiricist prison. For Blake, expanding the prison or accumulating more will not bring any respite, as only the Infinite will satisfy Man. If we could not attain the infinite, we would be in eternal despair, but because we are not, Blake reasons that we thus must be able to attain the Infinite, and as such, Man becomes Infinite himself; "Locke's principle of a reciprocal and mutually validating relationship among the mind, the sense organs, and their objects has been converted into a similarly structured reciprocity among infinite desire, its infinite object, and its infinite desirer."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 33)&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of influences, in 1787 [[Henry Fuseli]] was working on a translation of [[Johann Kaspar Lavater|J. K. Lavater]]'s ''[[Aphorisms on Man]]'' for the publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], when he hired Blake to engrave the frontispiece. Blake became so enamoured of Lavater's work that on the inside cover of his own copy of the book, he inscribed both his name and Lavater's, and drew a heart encompassing them.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd (1995: 107)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake also extensively annotated his own copy of ''Aphorisms'', and a number of critics have noted parallels between the Lavater annotations and Blake's own aphorisms in both ''All Religions'' and ''No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Hilton (2003: 195)&lt;/ref&gt; S. Foster Damon specifically points to Lavater's first two aphorisms as having a strong influence on Blake;

# Know, in the first place, that mankind agree in essence, as they do in their limbs and senses.
# Mankind differ as much in essence as they do in form, limbs, and senses - and only so, and not more".

To these points Blake has annotated "This is true Christian philosophy far above all abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Damon (1988: 16-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton and John Locke is paramount to the work, and it is known that Blake despised empiricism from an early age. ''c.''1808, he annotated Volume 1 of ''The Works of Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]]'', edited by [[Edmond Malone]], and wrote

{{quote|[[Edmund Burke|Burke's]] [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|Treatise on the Sublime &amp; Beautiful]] is founded on the Opinions of Newton &amp; Locke on this Treatise Reynolds has grounded many of his assertions. in all his Discourses I read Burkes Treatise when very Young at the same time I read Locke on [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Human Understanding]] &amp; Bacons [[The Advancement of Learning|Advancement of Learning]] on Every one of these Books I wrote my Opinions &amp; on looking them over find that my Notes on Reynolds in this Book are exactly Similar. I felt the Same Contempt &amp; Abhorrence then; that I do now. They mock Inspiration &amp; Vision Inspiration &amp; Vision was then &amp; now is &amp; I hope will always Remain my Element my Eternal Dwelling place. how can I then hear it Contemnd without returning Scorn for Scorn}}

The extreme empiricism of Series a closely mirrors some of the theories espoused by Locke and Bacon. For example, Blake's assertion that Man cannot deduce any other senses is specifically based on Bacon; "Man, being the servant and interpreter of nature, can do and understand so much and so much only as he has observed in fact or in thought of the course of nature beyond this he neither knows anything nor can do anything"&lt;ref&gt;Francis Bacon, ''The Philosophical Works'', ed. John M. Robertson (London: Routledge, 1905), 259&lt;/ref&gt; and Locke; "it is ''not possible'' for any one ''to imagine'' any other ''Qualities'' in Bodies, howsoever constituted, whereby they can be taken notice of, besides Sounds, Tastes, Smells, visible and tangible Qualities. And had Mankind been made but with four Senses, the Qualities then, which are the Object of the Fifth Sense, had been as far from our Notice, Imagination, and Conception, as now ''any belonging to a Sixth, Seventh, or Eighth Sense'', can possibly be."&lt;ref&gt;''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', ed. Peter H. Nidditch (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975), 2.2.3&lt;/ref&gt; However, Locke did argue that Man could build on simple ideas and create a complex concept of spirituality; "Moral Beings and Notions are founded on, and terminated in these simple ''Ideas'' we have received from Sensation or Reflection."&lt;ref&gt;''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', ed. Peter H. Nidditch (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975), 2.28.14&lt;/ref&gt; Blake ironically rejects this notion, arguing instead that just as Man cannot deduce more senses than he has, he cannot deduce ideas beyond those immediately perceivable by the senses. This claim, that Man cannot desire anything beyond his senses (such as transcendence), is going much further than either Locke or Bacon, neither of whom made any such assertion.

Harold Bloom also cites the work of [[Anthony Collins]], [[Matthew Tindal]] and [[John Toland]] as having an influence on Blake's thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Blake's Apocalypse'' (Garden City: Doubleday,  1963), 25&lt;/ref&gt; In a more general sense, "Blake sees the school of Bacon and Locke as the foundation of natural religion, the deistic attempt to prove the existence of God on the basis of sensate experience and its rational investigation."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 27)"&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 27)&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, Blake "manipulates the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] mythology of [[Jacob Bryant]], [[Paul Henri Mallet]], and perhaps other founders of what has become the comparative study of religion, to argue for the existence of a universal and supra-rational 'Poetic Genius' that expresses itself through the shared (though ever various) forms of all religions."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 27)"/&gt;

In relation to his later work, Northrop Frye sees ''All Religions are One'' and ''There is No Natural Religion'' as forming a fundamental statement of intent for Blake, a kind of pre-emptive outline of his future work, "a summarised statement of the doctrines of the engraved canon."&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1947: 14)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick and Joseph Viscomi state that they "contain some of Blake's most fundamental principles and reveal the foundation for later development in his thought and art."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt; W.H. Stevenson calls them "a very early statement of fundamental opinions [Blake] held all his life."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (2007: 55)&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of how Blake returned to the specific themes of ''No Natural Religion'', in ''[[Milton a Poem]]'' (1804–1810), he writes "This Natural Religion! this impossible absurdity" (40:13), and in ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]'' (1804-1820), "Natural Religion and [[Natural philosophy|Natural Philosophy]] are the Religion of the [[Pharisees]] who murdered Jesus" (52: "To the Deists"). He also repeats the important phrase "dull round" in his 1809 ''Descriptive Catalogue''; "Historians pretend, who being weakly organized themselves, cannot see either miracle or prodigy; all is to them a dull round of probabilities and possibilities."

The '''Tiar''' are [[scheduled caste]], found in [[North India]]. They are also known as the Parihar.&lt;ref name="S Gopal pages 933"&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI  Part Two edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 933 to 934 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

The word tiar is a corruption of the [[Sanskrit]] word ''thivara'', which means a hunter. They were traditionally hunters, but with the greater deforestation of their environment, they are now mainly farmers and fishermen. The Tiar in [[Bihar]] are found in the districts of [[Purnea]], [[Bhagalpur]], and [[Munger]], and Hooghly, Howrah, North &amp; South 24parganas in West Bengal and [[Jharkhand]]. A small number are also found in eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]]. According to some traditions, they are a sub-group of the [[Kewat]] community. &lt;ref name="S Gopal pages 933"/&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The Tiar have seven sub-divisions, the Rajbansi, Surajbansi, Polwar, Malhasuraiya, Kewat, Muriary and Bin. Among these clans, there is a sharp stratification and the Muriary and Bins are looked down upon. Like other [[Hindu]] communities, they maintain [[gotra]] exogamy. The Tiar are now landless, and most are agricultural labourers. They are [[Hindu]], but have their own tribal deity Raja Bhim Sen Salis. The Tiar speak [[Bhojpuri]] and most now understand [[Hindi]].&lt;ref name="S Gopal pages 933"/&gt;

The Tiar in [[Uttar Pradesh]] are confined to the [[Ballia Division]], although at one time they extended as far west as [[Sultanpur District]]. They were said to the rulers of this region until they were overthrown by the Bachgoti [[Rajput]]s. The Tiar are now mainly small cultivators, and speak the [[Awadhi]] dialect.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

'''Uli figures''' are wooden statues from [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. Like their neighbors to the north and south, the artistic traditions of the peoples of central New Ireland formerly focused largely around [[burial rites|mortuary rites]]. In contrast to the intricate ''[[malagan]]'' carvings of the north, artists in central New Ireland produced less ornate but more permanent figures known as ''uli'', which were kept and reused many times. No longer made today, uli were displayed as part of lengthy [[fertility rites]] involving the exhumation and reburial of human skulls, which accompanied the planting of [[Sacred herbs|sacred plants]]. 

When a newly carved uli was brought out, a [[shaman]] assisted in inducing the spirit of the deceased chief to enter the carving, and after the ceremony, the work was kept in the "men's house" where it would continue to aid the successor and his people.

Uli figures appear [[hermaphroditic]], having both a phallus and prominent breasts. This blending of male and female features possibly symbolized the fertile and nourishing powers of clan leaders, who were expected to provide for the other members of the clan. The Uli figures probably symbolized the connection between paternal and maternal life energy in initiation ceremonies.

The '''Vengi''' (or '''Venginadu''') is a region spread over the [[mandals]] of Godavari and [[Krishna district]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=pfAKljlCJq0C&amp;q=Pakanadu#v=snippet&amp;q=Pakanadu&amp;f=false|title=Precolonial India in Practice: Society, Region, and Identity in Medieval Andhra|last=Talbot|first=Cynthia|date=2001-09-20|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803123-9|page=278|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=xwXx7LB-ai4C&amp;dq=kamma+caste+from+Pakanadu&amp;q=kammanadu#v=snippet&amp;q=vengi&amp;f=false|title=A History of Telugu Literature|last=Chenchiah|last2=Bhujanga|date=1988-01-01|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120603134|page=15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital city of Vengi is located at [[Pedavegi]] near [[Eluru]].  This area was part of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] until that kingdom was conquered by Emperor [[Ashoka]] of the [[Mauryan]] Empire in the mid-3rd century BC. After the Mauryan Empire collapsed in 185 BC, the region was dominated by the [[Satavahanas]], who were succeeded in Vengi by the [[Andhra Ikshvaku]]s. Around 300 AD, the Andhra Ikshvakus were replaced by the [[Salankayanas]], who were vassals of the [[Pallavas]] of [[Southern India]]. In the late 5th century, the Salankayanas were annexed by the [[Vishnukundinas]].

King [[Pulakesin II]] of the [[Chalukya]] conquered Vengi from the [[Vishnukundinas]] in the early 7th century and installed his brother [[Kubja Vishnuvardhana]] as the viceroy. He eventually established the [[Eastern Chalukya]] dynasty. The Eastern Chalukyas were first conquered by the [[Cholas]] under [[Raja Raja Chola I]] (985–1014) and subsequently became very closely aligned to the [[Chola]] empire through marital alliance between the [[Cholas]] and the [[Eastern Chalukyas]]. This insulated the [[Eastern Chalukyas]] from the interference of the [[Western Chalukyas]] who sought to make the [[Eastern Chalukyas]] as their subordinates. During the reign of the [[Kulothunga Chola I]] the Vengi kingdom got absorbed into the [[Chola]] empire.

== Satavahana period ==
The Vengi territory was part of [[Ashoka]]'s empire and [[Satavahanas]] were the Mauryan feudatories administering the area. Following Ashoka's death and the decline of the Mauryas, Satavahana [[Simuka]] established the Satavahana dynasty, which came to include even the [[Magadha]] and [[Bengal]] at its height.The Satavahanas lasted for the next four hundred years after which the [[Pallavas]] and Eastern Chalukyas took control of the kingdom.

== Vengi Chalukyas ==
The Eastern Chalukyas of the 7th and 8th century, were a branch of the [[Chalukyas]] of [[Badami]]. Pulakesin II, the renowned ruler of Chalukyas conquered Vengi (at a battle near [[Eluru]]) in 624 from [[Vishnukundinas]] and installed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana (624- 641) as its ruler. His dynasty, known as the Eastern Chalukyas, ruled for a century. Vishnuvardhana extended his dominions up to [[Srikakulam]] in the north and [[Nellore]] in the south. They had faced many wars for the next three centuries from [[Rashtrakuta]]s and others. The [[Western Chalukya]] king [[Satyashraya]] tried to amalgamate the two dynasties, but was not successful due to the constant battles with the Paramaras and the Cholas.

To counter the interference of the Western Chalukyas, Rajaraja supported Saktivarman I, an Eastern Chalukya prince who was in exile in the Chola country. He invaded Vengi in 999 to restore Saktivarman to the Eastern Chalukya throne. Saktivarman finally got his throne back in 1002 and consented to recognise the Rajaraja overlordship.

== Later Cholas ==
Vengi was part of kingdom of [[Later Cholas]] during the 12th century. The Western Chalukyas under the king [[Vikramaditya VI]] occupied Vengi in 1118, but the [[Cholas]] under [[Vikrama Chola]] regained Vengi   from [[Chalukya]] monarch [[Someshvara III]] in 1126–27 with the help of the [[Velanati Chodas]] of [[Tsandavolu]].

== Later kingdoms ==
Between 1135 and 1206, several other minor kingdoms ruled over parts of Andhra Pradesh accepting the authority of the Velanati Cholas. By 1208, Vengi was part of [[Kakatiya Empire]] and later became part of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 14th century.

Vengi has occupied a prominent place in the history of [[Andhra Pradesh]] since the time of [[Eastern Chalukyas]]. They patronised [[Telugu people|Telugu]]. Since the time of the Eastern Chalukya Gunaga Vijayaditya, inscriptions show [[Telugu literature|Telugu]] prose and poetry, culminating in the production of literary works. Later on, in the 11th century under the patronage of the then Vengi king, [[Rajaraja Narendra]], the great epic, ''[[Mahabharata]]'' was translated partly by his court poet, [[Nannaya]].

[[File:ÅkeOhlmarks SvD A4 1938-09-26.jpg|thumb|Åke Ohlmarks 1938.]]
'''Åke Joel Ohlmarks''' (3 June 1911 &amp;ndash; 6 June 1984) was a Swedish author, translator and [[Religious studies|scholar of religion]]. He worked as a Lecturer at the [[University of Greifswald]] from 1941 to 1945. Together with the [[German Christians|Deutsche Christen]] member [[Wilhelm Koepp]] he founded the institute for religious studies there in 1944. His most notable contribution to the field is his 1939 study of [[Shamanism]]. As a translator, he is notable for his Swedish version of the Icelandic [[Edda]], of [[Complete Works of Shakespeare|Shakespeare's works]] and of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the [[Qur'an]] and works by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Nostradamus]] and others.

==Career==
Ohlmarks was born in [[Kristianstad]], Sweden and was the son of wholesaler Joel Ohlmarks and Anna-Lisa Larsson.&lt;ref name="Burling (1956), p. 746"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Burling |editor1-first=Ingeborg |date=1956 |title=Vem är det: svensk biografisk handbok. 1957 |trans-title=Who is it: Swedish biographical handbook. 1957 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Norstedt |language=Swedish |url=http://runeberg.org/vemardet/1957/0770.html |page=746}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate of Philosophy]] degree in 1935 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1937. Ohlmarks was Swedish lecturer in [[Tübingen]] from 1933 to 1934 and in [[Reykjavík]] from 1935 to 1936. He was docent and associate professor in the Swedish language in [[Greifswald]] from 1941 to 1945.&lt;ref name="Burling (1956), p. 746"/&gt; Ohlmarks was director of [[Europafilm]]'s manuscript department from 1950 to 1959, visiting professor in [[Zürich]] in 1965 and head of the Institut für vergleichende Felsbildforschung in [[Wagenhausen|Rheinklingen]] in 1966. He was also a co-worker of the ''[[Die Tat]]'' in Zürich from 1966.&lt;ref name="Lagerström (1968), p. 732"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Lagerström |editor-first=Sten |date=1968 |title=Vem är det: svensk biografisk handbok. 1969 |trans-title=Who is it: Swedish biographical handbook. 1969 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Norstedt |language=Swedish |url=http://runeberg.org/vemardet/1969/0748.html |page=732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was chairman of the Association of Nordic Philologists (''Föreningen nordiska filologer'') in [[Lund]] from 1931 to 1934 and of the Academic Society for the Swedish-Baltic Cooperation (''Akademiska föreningen för svensk-baltiskt samarbete'') from 1938 to 1940. Ohlmarks was secretary in the Science of Religion Coummunity (''Religionsvetenskapliga samfundet'') in Lund from 1936 and the community Ad patriam illustrandam in 1963.&lt;ref name="Lagerström (1968), p. 732"/&gt; 

==Translation of Tolkien's works==
{{Further|Translation of The Lord of the Rings into Swedish}}
Ohlmarks translation of Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings'' was strongly disliked by the author, prompting him to compile his ''[[Translations of The Lord of the Rings#Tolkien's "commentary"|Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings]]''. Ohlmarks not just invented many expression of his own, but also took great liberties with the contents of Tolkien's work, both by shortening many parts of it and by inserting his own interpretations.

Tolkien was also dissatisfied by the title ''Sagan om ringen'', "The [[Saga]] of the Ring".

As a result of the severe criticism directed against his translation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', both by Tolkien himself and by Swedish [[Tolkien fandom]], Ohlmarks in the late 1970s began to display hostility towards the "Tolkien phenomenon", and in 1982 published a book titled "Tolkien and [[Black magic|Black Magic]],"&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien och den svarta magin (1982), {{ISBN|978-91-7574-053-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
expounding a [[conspiracy theory]] connecting Tolkien and Tolkien fandom with [[Nazism and occultism|Nazi occultism]].

Despite the criticism and controversy, Ohlmarks's translations remained the only Swedish-language translations of ''The Lord of the Rings'' until 2004.

==Personal life==
In his second marriage, in 1954, he married Letty Steenstrup (born 1919), the daughter of Erling Steenstrup and Ruth Strandnaes.&lt;ref name="Burling (1956), p. 746"/&gt; In his third marriage, in 1969, he married editorial assistant Monica Suter (born 1940), daughter of Adolf Suter von Schwyz and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1976 |title=Vem är det: svensk biografisk handbok. 1977 |trans-title=Who is it: Swedish biographical handbook. 1977 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Norstedt |language=Swedish |isbn=91-1-766022-X |url=http://runeberg.org/vemardet/1977/0799.html |page=779}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohlmarks died in 1984 in Crist di Niardo, [[Brescia]], [[Italy]].
