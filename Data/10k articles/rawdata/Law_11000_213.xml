The '''1991 Sino-Soviet Border Agreement''' was a [[treaty]] between [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]] that set up demarcation work to resolve most of the border disputes between the two states. Initially signed by China and the Soviet Union, the terms of the agreement were resumed by Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union. The treaty resulted in some minor territorial changes along the border.

==Background==
The border between the Soviet Union and China had long been an issue of contention. The Sino-Soviet border was a legacy of various treaties between the [[Qing Dynasty]] and the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Treaty of Aigun]] and the [[Treaty of Beijing]], in which Russia gained over 1&amp;nbsp;million km² (400,000&amp;nbsp;mi²) of territory in [[Manchuria]] at China's expense, and another 500,000&amp;nbsp;km² in the western regions from several other treaties. These treaties have long been regarded by Chinese as [[Unequal Treaties|unequal treaties]], and the issue partially arose again with the Sino-Soviet split, with tensions eventually leading to division-scale military clashes along the border in 1969.

Even as tensions lessened and leaders on both sides adopted more conciliatory attitudes, the border issue remained unresolved. Despite their view of the previous border treaties as unequal ones, Chinese leaders were willing to negotiate on the basis of the modern boundaries. That left about 35,000&amp;nbsp;km² of territory in dispute, with about 28,000&amp;nbsp;km² in the [[Pamir Mountains]] of [[Tajikistan]], 6,000&amp;nbsp;km² elsewhere along the western border, and about 1,000&amp;nbsp;km² along the [[Argun River (Asia)|Argun]], [[Amur River|Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] rivers on the eastern border.&lt;ref name="bakshi"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jyotsna Bakshi | title=Russia-China Boundary Agreement: Relevance for India | journal=Strategic Analysis: A Monthly Journal of the IDSA | year=2001 | volume=21 | issue=10 | url=http://www.ciaonet.org/olj/sa/sa_jan01baj01.html | subscription=yes| accessdate= 23 February 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Border negotiations were eventually resumed in 1987 at [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s initiation. An agreement was reached on the eastern portion of the border on May 16, 1991, several months before the final dissolution of the USSR. Russia inherited most of the former Sino-Soviet border, and ratified the agreement in February 1992, while the other post-Soviet republics negotiated separate border agreements.

==Agreement==
The agreement largely finalized the 4,200&amp;nbsp;km (2,600&amp;nbsp;mi) border between the Soviet Union and China, except for a few disputed areas. The agreement states the intentions of both parties in resolving and demarcating the disputed border peacefully, identifies the various points of contention, and identifies the border as running through the center of the main channel of any river, based on the [[thalweg|thalweg principle]]. The location of the main channel and the possession of the various islands would be decided in the course of the demarcation work. Various other articles stipulate military, usage, and traffic rights along the river borders. Two areas, [[Heixiazi]] and [[Abagaitu Islet]], were excluded from the agreement, and their status would not be resolved until 2004. According to the estimates by Boris Tkachenko, a Russian historian, the treaty resulted in net territorial gain for China, which received about 720&amp;nbsp;km², including some seven hundred islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cio.ceu.hu/courses/CIO/modules/Module06Lomanov/Lomanov_06.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311201905/http://cio.ceu.hu/courses/CIO/modules/Module06Lomanov/Lomanov_06.html |archive-date=2007-03-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because islands on the Argun, Amur, and Ussuri rivers often split the rivers into multiple streams, the location of the main stream (and thus the border) was often not immediately apparent. Obviously, each country would receive a greater number of islands if the recognized main channel was closer to the opposite bank. Thus, the demarcation work was often controversial and subject to local protests over disputed territories. The demarcation work continued nearly up until its 1997 deadline.

==Disputed territories and their resolution==
The border territories that were disputed (arranged clockwise):

===Western border===
After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the former Sino-Soviet border was now shared by Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Russia. While the majority of the disputed territories lay in the west, the Russian Federation inherited only about 50&amp;nbsp;km (26&amp;nbsp;mi) of the former western Sino-Soviet border. China negotiated{{when|date=July 2011}} separate border agreements with each of the post-Soviet republics on its western borders. (See e.g. the [[China–Kazakhstan border]]).

===Argun River===
[[Image:China USSR E 88.jpg|thumb|309px|Some of the disputed areas in the Argun and Amur rivers]]
Menkeseli was a 17.5&amp;nbsp;km² (7&amp;nbsp;mi²) region along the [[Argun River (Asia)|Argun River]] that according to the agreement should have been transferred to China. However, this was opposed by local Russian civilians, who used this area for fishing. The dispute was finally finalized in 1996, in which the region would be transferred to China but local Russian residents would be guaranteed special usage rights to the region.

413&amp;nbsp;islands and islets along the river were disputed. The final apportionment has 204&amp;nbsp;islands in Soviet territory and 209&amp;nbsp;islands in Chinese territory.

Specifically excluded from the agreement was the status of 5&amp;nbsp;km² (2&amp;nbsp;mi²) [[Abagaitu Islet]], on the border between China's [[Inner Mongolia]] and Russia's [[Chita Oblast]] and near the cities of [[Zabaykalsk]] and [[Manzhouli]]. In Chinese it is known by the Mongolian name of Abaigaitui, while the name in Russian is Bolshoy. This island would be transferred to China in [[Complementary Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation on the Eastern Section of the China–Russia Boundary|subsequent agreements in 2004]].

===Amur River===
The islands of the Amur river were subject to some border clashes between Soviet and Japanese forces during the Manchukuo period. After the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchukuo]] during [[World War II]], the Soviet Union unilaterally occupied many of the islands along the Amur River and prevented Chinese locals from entering.&lt;ref name="akihiro_1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Iwashita Akihiro |title=A 4,000 Kilometer Journey Along the Sino-Russian Border |journal=Slavic Eurasian Studies |year=2004 |volume=3 |url=http://src-home.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no3_ses/webtop.html |pages=96–100 |accessdate=20 February 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203163959/http://src-home.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no3_ses/webtop.html |archivedate=3 February 2006 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These islands were the site of several military skirmishes during the 1960s. Most of the disputed islands have been transferred to China. Of the 1,680&amp;nbsp;islands along the Amur, the agreement now recognizes 902&amp;nbsp;Chinese islands and 708&amp;nbsp;Russian islands.

The two islands of Bolshoy Ussuriysky (32&amp;nbsp;km²) and Tarabarov island (4&amp;nbsp;km²) near [[Khabarovsk]], along the junction of the Amur and Ussuri rivers were specifically excluded from the agreement. The two islands are referred to collectively in Chinese as [[Heixiazi]], although the smaller Tarabarov is sometimes called Yinlong. The status of these islands [[Complementary Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation on the Eastern Section of the China–Russia Boundary|was resolved in 2004]], when Tarabarov and approximately 50% of Bolshoy Ussuriysky were transferred to China.

===Ussuri River===
Of almost 150&amp;nbsp;island groups on the Ussuri river, almost forty lay disputed. Many of these islands were the site of numerous skirmishes and clashes before and during the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]]. Of the 320&amp;nbsp;islands along this river, the agreement recognizes 167&amp;nbsp;Russian islands and 153&amp;nbsp;Chinese islands.

Kutsuzov is the largest island along the Ussuri. Under former Chinese possession it was known as Daxitong dao. Control was transferred to the Soviet Union during the [[Manchukuo]] period. Under the terms of the agreement, the island remained in Russia's possession.

Damansky, or [[Zhenbao Island]] along the Ussuri River, was the site of the 1969 [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|Damansky Island incident]]. After the conflict, the Chinese appear to have retained de facto control over the island. The agreement recognized China's ''de jure'' as well as ''de facto'' control.

===Lake Khanka===
Around 3&amp;nbsp;km² (1&amp;nbsp;mi²) of territory at [[Lake Khanka]] near the village of [[Tury Rog]] was transferred to Chinese control.

West of Lake Khanka lay a section of territory unilaterally seized from Manchukuo by the Soviet Union in 1933. This territory, about 0.70 to 0.9&amp;nbsp;km² (170&amp;nbsp;to 220&amp;nbsp;acres), has been transferred to Chinese control.

===Suifen River===
A delta forms at the junction of the Suifen and Granitnaya Rivers, which is also the location of the border. In 1903, the [[Russian Empire]] acquired control of the delta. The delta was later given to Manchukuo, which was then restored to China, but the Soviet Union retained control of the islands along the river. These islands have been transferred to China.

===Granitnaya River===
This dispute involves a section of the former land border near the [[Granitnaya River]], which borders part of [[Heilongjiang|Heilongjiang Province]] and Ussuriysky District (now [[Ussuriysk]] urban district) of [[Primorsky Krai]]. The original [[Convention of Peking]] (Beijing) states this section of the border lies along the Granitnaya, but the origin of the river de facto lay inside Russian territory. With the 1991 agreement, Russia transferred 9&amp;nbsp;km² (3.5&amp;nbsp;mi²) to China so that now the Sino-Russian border runs along the entire length of the river.

===Tumen River===
{{off-topic|Sino-Russian relations since 1991|date=December 2011}}
The [[Khasansky District]] lies near the Sino-North Korean border and the Sino-Russian border and included two disputed regions along the [[Tumen River]]. According to the agreement, 3&amp;nbsp;km² (1&amp;nbsp;mi²) of territory would be transferred to China, and Chinese ships would gain the right to navigate the Tumen river. The territory transfer would connect a previously [[enclave]]d piece of Chinese territory to the rest of China ([[Fangchuancun]]). This portion of the agreement stirred up some controversy among some Russian officials from Primorsky Krai, as they felt that direct Chinese access to the [[Sea of Japan]] (through the Tumen River) would decrease the economic importance of [[Vladivostok]] and [[Nakhodka]]. Other arguments protested at potential pollution from Chinese economic development, the possibility of Chinese military vessels navigating the river, and the presence of a Russian cemetery commemorating the [[Battle of Lake Khasan|Lake Khasan Incident]] in the area. Finally, in June 1997, the Russian side proposed a resolution which would divide the disputed territory in half. This was accepted by China in September of the same year, and in November, when the border demarcation work was declared finished, 1.6&amp;nbsp;km² (0.6&amp;nbsp;mi²) were transferred to China, and 1.4&amp;nbsp;km² (0.5&amp;nbsp;mi²) were retained by Russia. The Lake Khasan cemetery remained on the Russian side, and the Chinese officials underwent informal agreements to not build a port along the Tumen River.

===Sino-Russian-North Korean border===
The exact location of the Sino-Russian border along the left bank of the Tumen River was an area of contention (the entirety of the right bank of the river belonging to [[North Korea]]). The [[Convention of Peking]] (Beijing) set the location of border at 24&amp;nbsp;km (15&amp;nbsp;mi) above the mouth of the river, where it enters the Sea of Japan, but through Chinese negotiation was later moved to about&amp;nbsp;15 or 16&amp;nbsp;km (9&amp;nbsp;mi) above the mouth. In 1964, both sides agreed to a border about 17&amp;nbsp;km (11&amp;nbsp;mi) above the mouth, and these terms were kept in the 1991 agreement. However, the Russian side preferred it to be set at 24&amp;nbsp;km, and the Chinese at 15&amp;nbsp;km. The final position was set at 18.3&amp;nbsp;km (11.3&amp;nbsp;mi) above the mouth of the river.

The final position of the triangular border, where China, Russia, and North Korea meet, was successfully demarcated in 1998 after trilateral negotiations from all three countries, and went into effect 1999.

==Relation to Taiwanese mainland claim==
{{see also|Political status of Taiwan|Russia–Taiwan relations|Mongolia–Taiwan relations}}
The [[Republic of China]] now based in [[Taiwan]] does not recognize any Chinese territorial changes based on any border agreements signed by the People's Republic of China with any other countries, including this 1991 one, due to the requirements in the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] and its Additional Articles.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Neither does Russia recognize Taiwan as an independent country.

==Surrounding issues==

===Communism===
Prior to the declaration, the five Southeast Asian states struggled to contain [[communist]] influence. At the time, the [[Philippines|Filipino]] government struggled to give [[amnesty]] to former [[Hukbalahap]] militants, who staged an armed conflict in [[Luzon]] during the 1950s that almost led to the collapse of the central government. Conflict between the Indonesian military and the increasingly influential [[Indonesian Communist Party]] ended in late-1965 with the subsequent transition to [[Suharto]]'s [[Orde Baru|"New Order"]] that was staunchly anti-communist in contrast to previous president, [[Sukarno]]'s increasingly communist-aligned administration. The [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] was busy fighting communists during the [[Malayan Emergency]].

[[Communism]] also led to the idea of merging the Federation of Malaya, [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]], Singapore, and [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]] into one entity, which had the intention of eliminating the possibility of Singapore falling into communism. This was achieved with the creation of modern [[Federation of Malaysia]]. [[Singapore in Malaysia|Singapore left the federation in 1965]] due to ideological differences, as to how the federation should be governed, but remained a capitalist democratic society with close ties with its new neighbors.

===Tensions between neighbours===
A related matter was the formation of Malaysia. In 1961, [[Federation of Malaya|Malayan]] Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] announced a proposal to create a new federation called Malaysia. This was opposed by Indonesia and the Philippines because Indonesia believed the new formation was a form of [[neo-colonialism]] while the Philippines [[North Borneo dispute|claimed eastern North Borneo]] (Sabah) as part of its territory.

To defuse tension, a non-political confederation called [[Maphilindo]] was formed. This, however, was not successful due to the perception that Maphilindo was formed to delay or prevent the formation of Malaysia.

Despite opposition, Malaysia was formed in 1963. This led to the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]]. The Philippines withdrew diplomatic ties, causing relations to remain sour until the formation of ASEAN.

It is believed by scholars that the formation of ASEAN has prevented hostilities between [[Southeast Asia]]n states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dfGR1iPfxTwC&amp;pg=PA467&amp;dq=konfrontasi+manila&amp;lr=&amp;cd=26#v=onepage&amp;q=konfrontasi%20manila&amp;f=false Globalisation: encyclopaedia of trade, labour, and politics by Ashish K.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; born December 1963) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] man who is known for having raked through the [[dustbins]] of [[law firms]] representing prominent people in search of incriminating or compromising documents that he could sell to the press. Pell has reportedly now 'retired' from this activity and makes his living as a media law expert.

==Documentary and court cases==
Pell was the subject of a [[Channel 4]] [[television documentary]] ''Scandal in the Bins'' (2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b845d5885 "Scandal in the Bins"], BFI Film Forever&lt;/ref&gt; produced by [[Victor Lewis-Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0989704/ "''Scandal in the Bins'' (2000)"], IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; Another documentary -- reportedly in production at around the same time -- produced by Iain Jones, led Pell to claim in 2001 that John Mappin had fraudulently misrepresented his claim to be able to make a movie about Pell, and had "hoodwinked" him out of nearly £80,000.&lt;ref&gt;Conal Walsh [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/may/06/conalwalsh.theobserver "Binman Benji sues jewellery empire heir"], ''The Observer'', 6 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Pell successfully sued Mappin, whose family founded the [[Mappin &amp; Webb]] jewellery firm, and recovered his £77,750; Mappin had said he could commission a "well-connected Hollywood film-maker", but Jones had turned out to be a [[hairdresser]].&lt;ref name="Leonard1"&gt;Tom Leonard [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1388275/Benji-the-Binman-wins-back-77500.html "Benji the Binman wins back £77,500"], telegraph.co.uk, 20 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Milmo [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/mar/19/pressandpublishing "'Benji the binman' wins fraud claim"], mediaguardian.co.uk, 19 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The court ordered Mappin to pay Pell's legal costs and interest on the money he had been given.&lt;ref name="Leonard1"/&gt; According to an interview Pell gave at this time, he ended his regular bin-searching activity in February 2001.&lt;ref name="Leonard2"/&gt;

==History==

===''Gillette Cavalcade of Sports''===
The earliest incarnation of NBC's boxing telecasts could be traced back to 1944.  Although technically, an anthology program, the ''[[Gillette Cavalcade of Sports|Cavalcade of Sports]]'' was best known for Friday night boxing (from [[Madison Square Garden]]) on NBC from 1944 through 1960, and (after NBC decided against featuring boxing due to sensitivity over criminal allegations in the sport) then for several more years on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  When ''Cavalcade of Sports'' closed up shop on June 24, 1960 after a 14-year period, it marked the longest continuous run of any boxing program in television history.

====''Boxing from St. Nicholas Arena''====
Another boxing program called ''[[Boxing from St. Nicholas Arena]]'' aired on NBC during the same period (more specifically, from 1946–1948) as the ''Cavalcade of Sports''.

===''Sportsworld'' and partnership with Telemundo===
In 2003, NBC entered a [[joint venture]] with [[Telemundo]] and boxing promotional group Main Events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/everlast2304.php Everlast Will Sponsor NBC, Telemundo And Main Events Pro Boxing Television Series] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325115026/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/everlast2304.php |date=March 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On three consecutive Saturday afternoons – May 3, 10 and 17 – NBC Sports and Telemundo provided live coverage from the same Main Events-promoted boxing event.  It marked the first time that NBC broadcast professional boxing since 1992, when ''[[Sportsworld (U.S. TV series)|Sportsworld]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/07/sports/sports-people-boxer-skips-bout.html?scp=1&amp;sq=NBC+SportsWorld&amp;st=nyt SPORTS PEOPLE; Boxer Skips Bout – November 7, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/13/sports/boxing-a-weapon-in-tv-rating-game.html?scp=2&amp;sq=NBC+SportsWorld&amp;st=nyt Boxing a Weapon In TV Rating Game – July 13, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/09/sports/tv-sports-nbc-plans-to-take-tougher-approach.html?scp=1&amp;sq=NBC+SportsWorld&amp;st=nyt TV SPORTS; NBC Plans to Take Tougher Approach – March 9, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; ended its run after 14 years.

The following year, NBC and Telemundo renewed their partnership with a series of five Saturday cards beginning April 17.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/4354886 Boxing returns to NBC with 5-fight series]&lt;/ref&gt;

===NBCSN's ''Fight Night''===
Beginning in 2006, when the [[NBCSN]] was known as Versus, they began airing matches from [[Bob Arum]]'s [[Top Rank]] group. [[Nick Charles (sportscaster)|Nick Charles]] was one of the announcers. In 2010, Versus broadcast the [[World Series of Boxing]].

NBCSN's ''Fight Night'' series premiered on January 21, 2012 from [[2300 Arena]] in Philadelphia with [[Kenny Rice]] and trainer [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddie Roach]] on the call and [[Chris Mannix]] of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' serving as reporter and researcher.

==Notable bouts on NBC==
On July 2, 1921, NBC's future owner [[RCA]] and its [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] based radio station [[WJY (Hoboken, New Jersey)|WJY]] presented live coverage of the [[Jack Dempsey]] vs. [[Georges Carpentier]] heavyweight title fight. In the first major sporting event to be broadcast to a regional audience, ringside announcer J. Andrew White called Dempsey's fourth-round knockout victory.

On June 1, 1939, NBC (or technically, WNBT, which would eventually becoming NBC's [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] affiliate, [[WNBC]]) became the first American television network to broadcast a boxing match. Emanating from Yankee Stadium in New York City, Bill Stern provided the blow-by-blow commentary for the fight between [[Lou Nova]] and [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]]. 

On the premiere episode of ''[[Gillette_Cavalcade_of_Sports#As_Cavalcade_of_Sports|Cavalcade of Sports]]'' (airing on September 29, 1944), NBC broadcast a 15-round bout between [[Willie Pep]] and [[Chalky Wright]].

On June 19, 1946, at Yankee Stadium, [[Joe Louis]] defeated [[Billy Conn]] in the first [[television|televised]] World Heavyweight Championship bout ever. 146,000 people watched it on TV, also setting a record for the most seen world heavyweight bout in history. One year later on NBC on December 5, Joe Louis defeated [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] to retain the world heavyweight title.

On February 14, 1951, [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] defeated [[Jake LaMotta]] in 13 rounds for the world middleweight title.

On the March 26, 1954 edition of ''Gillette Cavalcade of Sports'' from New York City's [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]], Al Andrews and [[Gustav Scholz]] fought in NBC's first [[Color television|color]] transmission of a sporting event.

On the July 14, 1979 edition of ''[[Sportsworld (U.S. TV series)|NBC SportsWorld]]'', NBC aired an eight round long exhibition match from [[Denver]]'s [[Mile High Stadium]] between former [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]] defensive lineman [[Lyle Alzado]] and [[Muhammad Ali]]. [[Sam Nover]]&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=Ali Boxing vs Football and Lyle Alzado МУХАММЕД АЛИ|id=iWBbVFUVulk}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided the blow-by-blow commentary with [[Dick Schaap]] reporting. Two years later on June 25, ''NBC SportsWorld'' aired [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]'s victory in the ninth round against [[Ayub Kalule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=Sugar Ray Leonard vs Ayub Kalule|id=bbas0GWb5io}}&lt;/ref&gt; to become the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[List_of_WBA_world_champions#Super_welterweight|World Light Middleweight champion]]. [[Marv Albert]] and [[Ferdie Pacheco]] called the action from [[Houston]]'s [[Astrodome]].

On May 20, 1985, NBC broadcast in [[prime time]] the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|Heavyweight Championship of the World]] bout between [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Carl Williams (boxer)|Carl Williams]]. In what would become NBC's final prime time boxing broadcast for 30 years, [[Dick Enberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=Larry Holmes vs Carl "The Truth" Williams (NBC Broadcast)|id=M7qE_ZV4uRU}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted while Marv Albert provided blow-by-blow coverage with analyst Ferdie Pacheco.

{{Criminology and penology |theory}}
The '''broken windows theory''' is a [[Criminology|criminological]] theory that visible signs of [[crime]], [[anti-social behavior]], and [[civil disorder]] create an [[Urban area|urban environment]] that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. The theory thus suggests that policing methods that target minor crimes such as [[vandalism]], public drinking, and [[fare evasion]] help to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes.

The theory was introduced in a 1982 article by social scientists [[James Q. Wilson]] and [[George L. Kelling]].{{sfn|Wilson|Kelling|1982}} It was further popularized in the 1990s by [[New York City]] police commissioner [[William Bratton]] and Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], whose policing policies were influenced by the theory.

The theory has been subject to great debate both within the [[social science]]s and the public sphere. In some cases,{{clarify|date=July 2018}} broken windows policing has become associated with controversial police practices such as the use of "[[Stop-and-frisk in New York City|stop, question, and frisk]]" by the [[New York City Police Department]]. In response, Bratton and Kelling have written that broken windows policing should not be treated as "[[zero tolerance]]" or "zealotry", but as a method that requires "careful training, guidelines and supervision" and a positive relationship with communities, thus linking it to [[community policing]].

==Article and crime prevention==
[[File:Broken_windows,_Northampton_State_Hospital.jpg|thumb|The broken windows of an abandoned hospital building in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]]]
James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling first introduced the broken windows theory in an article titled "Broken Windows", in the March 1982 ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}} The title comes from the following example:
{{quote |Consider a building with a few broken windows. If the windows are not repaired, the tendency is for vandals to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it's unoccupied, perhaps become squatters or light fires inside.

Or consider a pavement. Some litter accumulates. Soon, more litter accumulates. Eventually, people even start leaving bags of refuse from take-out restaurants there or even break into cars.}}

The article received a great deal of attention and was very widely cited. A 1996 [[criminology]] and [[urban sociology]] book, ''Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities'' by [[George L. Kelling]] and Catharine Coles, is based on the article but develops the argument in greater detail. It discusses the theory in relation to [[crime]] and strategies to contain or eliminate crime from urban neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = George| last1 = Kelling | first2 = Catherine | last2 = Coles | title = Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities | isbn = 0-684-83738-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful strategy for preventing vandalism, according to the book's authors, is to address the problems when they are small. Repair the broken windows within a short time, say, a day or a week, and the tendency is that vandals are much less likely to break more windows or do further damage. Clean up the sidewalk every day, and the tendency is for [[litter]] not to accumulate (or for the rate of littering to be much less). Problems are less likely to escalate and thus "respectable" residents do not flee the neighborhood.

Though police work is crucial to crime prevention, Oscar Newman, in his 1972 book, ''Defensible Space'', wrote that the presence of police authority is not enough to maintain a safe and crime-free city. People in the community help with crime prevention. Newman proposes that people care for and protect spaces they feel invested in, arguing that an area is eventually safer if the people feel a sense of ownership and responsibility towards the area. Broken windows and vandalism are still prevalent because communities simply do not care about the damage. Regardless of how many times the windows are repaired, the community still must invest some of their time to keep it safe. Residents' negligence of broken window-type decay signifies a lack of concern for the community. Newman says this is a clear sign that the society has accepted this disorder—allowing the unrepaired windows to display vulnerability and lack of defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Oscar | last = Newman | title = Defensible Space: Crime Prevention Through Urban Design | isbn = 0-02-000750-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm Gladwell also relates this theory to the reality of NYC in his book ''[[The Tipping Point]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gladwell | url = http://gladwell.com/the-tipping-point/ | title = The tipping point | access-date = 2014-03-03 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150729063844/http://gladwell.com/the-tipping-point/# | archive-date = 2015-07-29 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory thus makes two major claims: that further petty crime and low-level anti-social behavior is deterred, and that major crime is prevented as a result. Criticism of the theory has tended to focus disproportionately on the latter claim.&lt;!--Isn't it, 'enforcing small crimes prevents big crimes,' which is one major claim, not two? At best this is a confusing sentence. I'm not sure enough what it's trying to say to fully rewrite it. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-problem-with-broken-windows-policing/ |title=The Problem with Broken Windows Policing |last=Childress |first=Sarah |date=28 June 2016 |website=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) |publisher=PBS Frontline |access-date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical explanation==
The reason the state of the urban environment may affect crime may be three factors:
* [[social norm]]s and [[conformity]],
* the presence or lack of routine [[surveillance|monitoring]], and
* social signaling and [[signal crime]].

In an anonymous urban environment, with few or no other people around, social norms and monitoring are not clearly known. Individuals thus look for signals within the environment as to the social norms in the setting and the risk of getting caught violating those norms; one of the signals is the area's general appearance.

Under the broken windows theory, an ordered and clean environment, one that is maintained, sends the signal that the area is monitored and that criminal behavior is not tolerated. Conversely, a disordered environment, one that is not maintained (broken windows, graffiti, excessive litter), sends the signal that the area is not monitored and that criminal behavior has little risk of detection.

The theory assumes that the landscape "communicates" to people. A broken window transmits to criminals the message that a community displays a lack of informal social control and so is unable or unwilling to defend itself against a criminal invasion. It is not so much the actual broken window that is important, but the message the broken window sends to people. It symbolizes the community's defenselessness and vulnerability and represents the lack of [[group cohesiveness|cohesiveness]] of the people within. Neighborhoods with a strong sense of cohesion fix broken windows and assert social responsibility on themselves, effectively giving themselves control over their space.

The theory emphasizes the built environment, but must also consider human behavior.{{Sfn | Herbert | Brown | 2006}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

Under the impression that a broken window left unfixed leads to more serious problems, residents begin to change the way they see their community. In an attempt to stay safe, a cohesive community starts to fall apart, as individuals start to spend less time in communal space to avoid potential violent attacks by strangers.{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} The slow deterioration of a community as a result of broken windows modifies the way people behave when it comes to their communal space, which, in turn, breaks down community control. As rowdy teenagers, panhandlers, addicts, and prostitutes slowly make their way into a community, it signifies that the community cannot assert informal social control, and citizens become afraid that worse things will happen. As a result, they spend less time in the streets to avoid these subjects and feel less and less connected from their community if the problems persist.

At times, residents tolerate "broken windows" because they feel they belong in the community and "know their place." Problems, however, arise when outsiders begin to disrupt the community's cultural fabric. That is the difference between "regulars" and "strangers" in a community. The way that "regulars" act represents the culture within, but strangers are "outsiders" who do not belong.{{Sfn | Herbert | Brown | 2006}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

Consequently, daily activities considered "normal" for residents now become uncomfortable, as the culture of the community carries a different feel from the way that it was once.

With regard to social geography, the broken windows theory is a way of explaining people and their interactions with space. The culture of a community can deteriorate and change over time with the influence of unwanted people and behaviors changing the landscape. The theory can be seen as people shaping space as the civility and attitude of the community create spaces used for specific purposes by residents. On the other hand, it can also be seen as space shaping people with elements of the environment influencing and restricting day-to-day decision making.

However, with policing efforts to remove unwanted disorderly people that put fear in the public’s eyes, the argument would seem to be in favor of "people shaping space" as public policies are enacted and help to determine how one is supposed to behave. All spaces have their own codes of conduct, and what is considered to be right and normal will vary from place to place.

The concept also takes into consideration spatial exclusion and social division as certain people behaving in a given way are considered disruptive and therefore unwanted. It excludes people from certain spaces because their behavior does not fit the class level of the community and its surroundings. A community has its own standards and communicates a strong message to criminals, by social control, that their neighborhood does not tolerate their behavior. If however, a community is unable to ward off would-be criminals on their own, policing efforts help.

By removing unwanted people from the streets, the residents feel safer and have a higher regard for those that protect them. People of less civility who try to make a mark in the community are removed, according to the theory.{{Sfn | Herbert | Brown | 2006}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} Excluding the unruly and people of certain social statuses is an attempt to keep the balance and cohesiveness of a community.

==Concepts==
===Informal social controls===
Many claim that [[informal social control]]s can be an effective strategy to reduce unruly behavior. {{Harvnb | Garland | 2001}} expresses that “community policing measures in the realization that informal social control exercised through everyday relationships and institutions is more effective than legal sanctions”.{{Sfn | Garland | 2001}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} Informal social control methods, has demonstrated a “get tough” attitude by proactive citizens, and expresses a sense that disorderly conduct is not tolerated. According to Wilson and Kelling, there are two types of groups involved in maintaining order, ‘community watchmen’ and ‘[[vigilante]]s’{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} The United States has adopted in many ways policing strategies of old European times, and at that time informal social control was the norm, which gave rise to contemporary formal policing. Though, in earlier times, there were no legal sanctions to follow, informal policing was primarily ‘objective’ driven as stated by Wilson and Kelling (1982).

{{Harvnb | Wilcox | Quisenberry | Cabrera | Jones | 2004}} argue that improper [[land use]] can cause disorder, and the larger the public land is, the more susceptible to criminal deviance.{{Sfn | Wilcox | Quisenberry | Cabrera | Jones | 2004 | p = 186}} Therefore, nonresidential spaces such as businesses, may assume to the responsibility of informal social control “in the form of [[surveillance]], communication, supervision, and intervention.”{{Sfn | Wilcox | Quisenberry | Cabrera | Jones | 2004 | p = 187}} It is expected that more strangers occupying the public land creates a higher chance for disorder. [[Jane Jacobs]] can be considered one of the original pioneers of this perspective of ''broken windows''. Much of her book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' focuses on residents' and nonresidents' contributions to maintaining order on the street, and explains how local businesses, institutions, and convenience stores provide a sense of having "eyes on the street."{{Sfn | Jacobs | 1961}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

On the contrary, many residents feel that regulating disorder is not their responsibility. Wilson and Kelling found that studies done by psychologists suggest people often refuse to go to the aid of someone seeking help, not due to a lack of concern or selfishness “but the absence of some plausible grounds for feeling that one must personally accept responsibility”{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} On the other hand, others plainly refuse to put themselves in harm's way, depending on how grave they perceive the nuisance to be; a 2004 study observed that "most research on disorder is based on individual level perceptions decoupled from a systematic concern with the disorder-generating environment."{{Sfn | Sampson | Raudenbush | 2004 | p = 319}} Essentially, everyone perceives disorder differently, and can contemplate seriousness of a crime based on those perceptions. However, Wilson and Kelling feel that although community involvement can make a difference, “the police are plainly the key to order maintenance.”{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

===Role of fear===
Ranasinghe argues that the concept of fear is a crucial element of broken windows theory, because it is the foundation of the theory.{{Sfn | Ranasinghe | 2012 | p = 65}} She also adds that public disorder is “...unequivocally constructed as problematic because it is a source of fear.”{{Sfn | Ranasinghe | 2012 | p = 67}} Fear is elevated as perception of disorder rises; creating a social pattern that tears the social fabric of a community, and leaves the residents feeling hopeless and disconnected. Wilson and Kelling hint at the idea, but don’t focus on its central importance. They indicate that fear was a product of incivility, not crime, and that people avoid one another in response to fear, weakening controls.{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} Hinkle and Weisburd found that police interventions to combat minor offenses, as per the broken windows model, "significantly increased the probability of feeling unsafe," suggesting that such interventions might offset any benefits of broken windows policing in terms of fear reduction.{{sfn|Hinkle|Weisburd|2008}}

===Difference with "zero tolerance"===
Broken windows policing is sometimes described as a "[[zero tolerance]]" policing style,&lt;ref name="The Broken Windows Theory"&gt;{{Citation | last = Adams | first = Joan | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/220030885/| title = The "Broken Windows" Theory | year = 2006 | publisher = UBC | place = [[Canada]] | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; including in some academic studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Sridhar|first=C.R.|title=Broken Windows and Zero Tolerance: Policing Urban Crimes|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date= 13–19 May 2006|volume= 41|issue= 19|pages= 1841–43|jstor= 4418196}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several key proponents such as Bratton and Kelling argue that there is a key difference. In 2014, they outlined a difference between "broken windows policing" and "zero tolerance":
{{quote|Critics use the term “zero tolerance” in a pejorative sense to suggest that Broken Windows policing is a form of zealotry—the imposition of rigid, moralistic standards of behavior on diverse populations. It is not. Broken Windows is a highly discretionary police activity that requires careful training, guidelines, and supervision, as well as an ongoing dialogue with neighborhoods and communities to ensure that it is properly conducted&lt;ref name="brattonkelling"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/why-we-need-broken-windows-policing-13696.html|title=Why we need Broken Windows policing|publisher=City Journal|author=William Bratton, George Kelling|date=December 2014|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Bratton and Kelling advocate that authorities should be effective at catching minor offenders while also giving them lenient punishment. Citing [[fare evasion]] as an example, they argue that the police should attempt to catch fare evaders, and that the vast majority should be [[Summons|summoned]] to court rather than arrested and given a punishment other than jail. The goal is to deter minor offenders from committing more serious crimes in the future and reduce the prison population in the long run.&lt;ref name="brattonkelling"/&gt;

==Critical developments==
In an earlier publication of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' released March, 1982, Wilson wrote an article indicating that police efforts had gradually shifted from maintaining order to fighting crime.{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} This indicated that order maintenance was something of the past, and soon it would seem as it has been put on the back burner. The shift was attributed to the rise of the social urban riots of the 1960s, and "social scientists began to explore carefully the order maintenance function of the police, and to suggest ways of improving it—not to make streets safer (its original function) but to reduce the incidence of mass violence".{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} Other criminologists argue between similar disconnections, for example, Garland argues that throughout the early and mid 20th century, police in American cities strived to keep away from the neighborhoods under their jurisdiction.{{Sfn | Garland | 2001}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} This is a possible indicator of the out-of-control social riots that were prevalent at that time. Still many would agree that reducing crime and violence begins with maintaining social control/order.

[[Jane Jacobs]]' ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' is discussed in detail by Ranasinghe, and its importance to the early workings of broken windows, and claims that Kelling's original interest in "minor offences and disorderly behaviour and conditions" was inspired by Jacobs' work.{{Sfn | Ranasinghe | 2012 | p = 68}} Ranasinghe includes that Jacobs' approach toward social disorganization was centralized on the "streets and their sidewalks, the main public places of a city" and that they "are its most vital organs, because they provide the principal visual scenes."{{Sfn | Jacobs | 1961 | p = 378}} Wilson and Kelling, as well as Jacobs, argue on the concept of civility (or the lack thereof) and how it creates lasting distortions between crime and disorder. Ranasinghe explains that the common framework of both set of authors is to narrate the problem facing urban public places. Jacobs, according to Ranasinghe, maintains that "Civility functions as a means of informal social control, subject little to institutionalized norms and processes, such as the law" 'but rather maintained through an' "intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among people... and enforced by the people themselves."{{Sfn | Ranasinghe | 2012 | p = 72}}

===Precursor experiments===
Before the introduction of this theory by Wilson and Kelling, [[Philip Zimbardo]], a Stanford psychologist, arranged an experiment testing the broken-window theory in 1969. Zimbardo arranged for an automobile with no license plates and the hood up to be parked idle in a [[Bronx]] neighbourhood and a second automobile in the same condition to be set up in [[Palo Alto, California]]. The car in the Bronx was attacked within minutes of its abandonment. Zimbardo noted that the first "vandals" to arrive were a family&amp;nbsp;– a father, mother and a young son&amp;nbsp;– who removed the radiator and battery. Within twenty-four hours of its abandonment, everything of value had been stripped from the vehicle. After that, the car's windows were smashed in, parts torn, upholstery ripped, and children were using the car as a playground. At the same time, the vehicle sitting idle in Palo Alto sat untouched for more than a week until Zimbardo himself went up to the vehicle and deliberately smashed it with a sledgehammer. Soon after, people joined in for the destruction. Zimbardo observed that a majority of the adult "vandals" in both cases were primarily well dressed, Caucasian, clean-cut and seemingly respectable individuals. It is believed that, in a neighborhood such as the Bronx where the history of abandoned property and theft are more prevalent, vandalism occurs much more quickly as the community generally seems apathetic. Similar events can occur in any civilized community when communal barriers—the sense of mutual regard and obligations of civility—are lowered by actions that suggest apathy.{{Sfn | Wilson | Kelling | 1982}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

===New York City===
{{See also|Crime in New York City}}
In 1985, the [[New York City Transit Authority]] hired [[George L. Kelling]], the author of ''Broken Windows'', as a consultant. Kelling was later hired as a consultant to the [[Boston Police Department|Boston]] and the [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles]] police departments.

One of Kelling's adherents, [[David L. Gunn]] implemented policies and procedures based on the Broken Windows Theory during his tenure as President of the New York City Transit Authority. One of his major efforts was to lead a campaign from 1984 to 1990 to rid [[graffiti]] from New York's subway system.

In 1990, [[William J. Bratton]] became head of the [[New York City Transit Police]]. Bratton was influenced by Kelling, describing him as his "intellectual mentor". In his role he implemented a tougher stance on [[fare evasion]], faster [[arrest|arrestee processing]] methods, and [[background check]]s on all those arrested.

After being elected [[Mayor of New York City]] in 1993 as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[Rudy Giuliani]] hired Bratton as his [[police commissioner]] to implement similar policies and practices throughout the city. Giuliani heavily subscribed to Kelling and Wilson's theories. Such policies emphasized addressing crimes that negatively affect [[quality of life]]. In particular, Bratton directed the police to more strictly enforce laws against subway fare evasion, [[public drinking]], [[public urination]], and graffiti. He increased enforcement against "[[squeegee men]]", those who aggressively demand payment at traffic stops for unsolicited car window cleanings. Bratton also revived the [[New York City Cabaret Law]], a previously dormant Prohibition era ban on dancing in unlicensed establishments. Throughout the late 1990s NYPD shut down many of the city's acclaimed night spots for illegal dancing.

According to a 2001 study of crime trends in New York City by Kelling and William Sousa, rates of both petty and serious crime fell significantly after the aforementioned policies were implemented. Furthermore, crime continued to decline for the following ten years. Such declines suggested that policies based on the Broken Windows Theory were [[effective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Corman|first=Hope|title=Carrots, Sticks and Broken Windows|date=Jun 2002|url=http://courses.washington.edu/pbaf512a/Carrotspaper.June13.pdf|publisher=Washington|format=[[Portable document format|PDF]]|subscription=yes}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other studies do not find a [[cause and effect]] relationship between the adoption of such policies and decreases in crime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-problem-with-broken-windows-policing/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ludwig | first = Jens | year = 2006 | title = Broken windows | url = http://home.uchicago.edu/~ludwigj/papers/Broken_windows_2006.pdf | publisher = U Chicago | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The decrease may have been part of a broader trend across the United States. Other cities also experienced less crime, even though they had different police policies. Other factors, such as the 39% drop in New York City's [[unemployment rate]], could also explain the decrease reported by Kelling and Sousa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Criticism for Giuliani's broken windows theory |date=Aug 2013 | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/criticism-for-giulianis-broken-windows-theory-2013-8 | newspaper = Business insider}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that when the New York Police Department (NYPD) stopped aggressively enforcing minor legal statutes in late 2014 and early 2015 that civilian complaints of three major crimes (burglary, felony assault, and grand larceny) decreased (slightly with large error bars) during and shortly after sharp reductions in proactive policing. There was no statistically significant effect on other major crimes such as murder, rape, robbery, or grand theft auto. These results are touted as challenging prevailing scholarship as well as conventional wisdom on authority and legal compliance by implying that aggressively enforcing minor legal statutes incites more severe criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Christopher M.|last2=O’Keeffe|first2=Zachary P.|date=2017-09-25|title=Evidence that curtailing proactive policing can reduce major crime|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0211-5|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0211-5|issn=2397-3374|volume=1|issue=10|pages=730–737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albuquerque===
[[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], instituted the Safe Streets Program in the late 1990s based on the Broken Windows Theory. Operating under the theory that American [[Western United States|Westerners]] use roadways much in the same way that American [[Eastern United States|Easterners]] use subways, the developers of the program reasoned that lawlessness on the roadways had much the same effect as it did on the [[New York City Subway]]. Effects of the program were reviewed by the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) and were published in a case study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/enforce/SafeStreets/ | place = US | publisher = Department of Transportation – NHTSA | title = Albuquerque Police Department's Safe streets program | id = DOT HS 809 278 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150403093901/http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/enforce/SafeStreets/ | archivedate = 2015-04-03 | df = }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lowell, Massachusetts===
In 2005, [[Harvard University]] and [[Suffolk University]] researchers worked with local police to identify 34 "crime hot spots" in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. In half of the spots, authorities cleared trash, fixed streetlights, enforced building codes, discouraged [[loitering|loiterers]], made more [[misdemeanor]] arrests, and expanded [[community mental health service|mental health services]] and aid for the [[homeless]]. In the other half of the identified locations, there was no change to routine police service.

The areas that received additional attention experienced a 20% reduction in calls to the police. The study concluded that cleaning up the physical environment was more effective than misdemeanor arrests and that increasing social services had no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.suffolk.edu/34417.html | publisher = Suffolk University | title = Research Boosts Broken Windows | accessdate = 2009-02-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090629171649/http://www.suffolk.edu/34417.html | archivedate = 2009-06-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/02/08/breakthrough_on_broken_windows/ |title = Breakthrough on 'broken windows’ |accessdate= 2009-02-20 |work= The Boston Globe |first= Carolyn Y | last = Johnson | date = 2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In 2007 and 2008, Kees Keizer and colleagues from the [[University of Groningen]] conducted a series of controlled experiments to determine if the effect of existing visible disorder (such as litter or graffiti) increased other crime such as theft, littering, or other [[antisocial behavior]]. They selected several urban locations, which they arranged in two different ways, at different times. In each experiment, there was a "disorder" condition in which violations of social norms as prescribed by signage or national custom, such as graffiti and littering, were clearly visible as well as a control condition where no violations of norms had taken place. The researchers then secretly monitored the locations to observe if people behaved differently when the environment was "disordered". Their observations supported the theory. The conclusion was published in the journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']]: "One example of disorder, like graffiti or littering, can indeed encourage another, like stealing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1161405 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1161405 |last1 =Keizer |first1 =K |last2=Lindenberg |first2=S |last3=Steg |first3=L |title=The Spreading of Disorder |accessdate =2008-11-28 |journal= Science |volume= 322 |issue= 5908 |pages= 1681–1685 |year=2008 |pmid= 19023045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12630201 |title= Can the can | accessdate=2008-11-24 |work=The Economist |date= 2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other advantages==

===Real estate===
Other side effects of better monitoring and cleaned up streets may well be desired by governments or housing agencies and the population of a neighborhood: broken windows can count as an indicator of low real estate value and may deter investors. Fixing windows is therefore also a step of [[real estate development]], which may lead, whether it is desired or not, to [[gentrification]]. By reducing the amount of broken windows in the community, the inner cities would appear to be attractive to consumers with more capital. Ridding spaces like downtown New York and Chicago, notably notorious for criminal activity, of danger would draw in investment from consumers, increasing the city's economic status, providing a safe and pleasant image for present and future inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://lawreview.uchicago.edu/sites/lawreview.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/73.1/73_1_Harcourt_Ludwig.pdf | first1 = Bernard L | last1 = Harcourt | first2 = Jens | last2 = Ludwig | title = Broken Windows: New Evidence from New York City and a Five-City Social Experiment | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130228134225/http://lawreview.uchicago.edu/sites/lawreview.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/73.1/73_1_Harcourt_Ludwig.pdf | archivedate = 2013-02-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In education, the broken windows theory is used to promote order in classrooms and school cultures. The belief is that students are signaled by disorder or rule-breaking and that they in turn imitate the disorder. Several school movements encourage strict paternalistic practices to enforce student discipline. Such practices include language codes (governing slang, curse words, or speaking out of turn), classroom etiquette (sitting up straight, tracking the speaker), personal dress (uniforms, little or no jewelry), and behavioral codes (walking in lines, specified bathroom times).

From 2004 to 2006, Stephen B. Plank and colleagues from [[Johns Hopkins University]] conducted a correlational study to determine the degree to which the physical appearance of the school and classroom setting influence student behavior, particularly in respect to the variables concerned in their study: fear, social disorder, and collective efficacy.&lt;ref name = schools&gt;{{cite journal |last1 =Plank|first1 =Stephen B | last2 =Bradshaw | first2 = Catherine P | last3 = Young | first3 = Hollie|title= An Application of "Broken‐Windows" and Related Theories to the Study of Disorder, Fear, and Collective Efficacy in Schools|journal=American Journal of Education|date= 1 February 2009|volume= 115 | issue = 2 | pages=227–47|doi=10.1086/595669}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They collected survey data administered to 6th-8th students by 33 public schools in a large [[mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] city. From analyses of the survey data, the researchers determined that the variables in their study are statistically significant to the physical conditions of the school and classroom setting. The conclusion, published in the ''[[American Journal of Education]]'', was
{{quote|...the findings of the current study suggest that educators and researchers should be vigilant about factors that influence student perceptions of climate and safety. Fixing broken windows and attending to the physical appearance of a school cannot alone guarantee productive teaching and learning, but ignoring them likely greatly increases the chances of a troubling downward spiral.&lt;ref name=schools /&gt;}}

==Policing==
'''Broken windows policing''' is a form of policing based on broken windows theory. It is also sometimes called '''quality-of-life policing'''. [[William J. Bratton]] popularized this policing strategy as New York City's police commissioner during the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/nyregion/eric-garner-police-chokehold-staten-island.html?_r=0 |title=Beyond the Chokehold: The Path to Eric Garner's Death |last=Baker |first=Al |website=The New York Times |publication-date=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Other factors===
Many critics state that factors other than physical disorder more significantly influence crime rate. They argue that efforts to more effectively reduce crime rate should target or pay more attention to such factors instead.

According to a study by [[Robert J. Sampson]] and [[Stephen Raudenbush]], the premise on which the theory operates, that social disorder and crime are connected as part of a causal chain, is faulty. They argue that a third factor, collective efficacy, "defined as cohesion among residents combined with shared expectations for the social control of public space," is the actual cause of varying crime rates that are observed in an altered neighborhood environment. They also argue that the relationship between public disorder and crime rate is weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Sampson| first1 = Robert J.| last2 = Raudenbush | first2 = Stephen W | title = Systematic Social Observation of Public Spaces: A New Look at Disorder in Urban Neighborhoods |journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=1 November 1999|volume=105|issue=3|pages = 603–51 | doi = 10.1086/210356|url=http://crab.rutgers.edu/~goertzel/NeighborhoodCrime.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C. R. Sridhar, in his article in the ''[[Economic and Political Weekly]]'', also challenges the theory behind broken windows policing and the idea that the policies of [[William Bratton]] and the [[New York Police Department]] was the cause of the decrease of crime rates in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Sridhar|first=C.R.|title=Broken Windows and Zero Tolerance: Policing Urban Crimes|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date= 13–19 May 2006|volume= 41|issue= 19|pages= 1841–43|jstor= 4418196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy targeted people in areas with a significant amount of physical disorder and there appeared to be a causal relationship between the adoption of broken windows policing and the decrease in crime rate. Sridhar, however, discusses other trends (such as New York City's economic boom in the late 1990s) that created a "[[perfect storm]]" that contributed to the decrease of crime rate much more significantly than the application of the broken windows policy. Sridhar also compares this decrease of crime rate with other major cities that adopted other various policies and determined that the broken windows policy is not as effective.

Baltimore criminologist Ralph B. Taylor argues in his book that fixing windows is only a partial and short-term solution. His data supports a materialist view: changes in levels of physical decay, superficial social disorder, and racial composition do not lead to higher crime, but economic decline does. He contends that the example shows that real, long-term reductions in crime require that urban politicians, businesses, and community leaders work together to improve the economic fortunes of residents in high-crime areas.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph B. Taylor. Breaking Away from Broken Windows: Baltimore Neighborhoods and the Nationwide Fight Against Crime, Grime, Fear, and Decline. {{ISBN|0813397588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tack was taken by a 2010 study questioning the legitimacy of the theory concerning the subjectivity of disorder as perceived by persons living in neighborhoods. It concentrated on whether citizens view disorder as a separate issue from crime or as identical to it. The study noted that crime cannot be the result of disorder if the two are identical, agreed that disorder provided evidence of "convergent validity" and concluded that broken windows theory misinterprets the relationship between disorder and crime.{{Sfn | Gau | Pratt | 2010}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

In recent years, there has been increasing attention on the correlation between environmental lead levels and crime. Specifically, there appears to be a correlation with a 25-year lag with the addition and removal of lead from paint and gasoline and rises and falls in murder arrests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricknevin.com/uploads/Lucifer_Curves_2-22-15.pdf Lucifer Curves] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225100935/http://www.ricknevin.com/uploads/Lucifer_Curves_2-22-15.pdf |date=February 25, 2015 }}, Rick Nevin, 22 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline America's Real Criminal Element: Lead], ''Mother Jones'', January/February 2013 Issue, Kevin Drum&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit bias===
Robert J. Sampson argues that based on common misconceptions by the masses, it is clearly implied that those who commit disorder and crime have a clear tie to groups suffering from financial instability and may be of minority status: "The use of racial context to encode disorder does not necessarily mean that people are racially prejudiced in the sense of personal hostility." He notes that residents make a clear implication of who they believe is causing the disruption, which has been termed as implicit bias.{{Sfn | Sampson | Raudenbush | 2004 | p = 320}} He further states that research conducted on implicit bias and stereotyping of cultures suggests that community members hold unrelenting beliefs of African-Americans and other disadvantaged minority groups, associating them with crime, violence, disorder, welfare, and undesirability as neighbors.{{Sfn | Sampson | Raudenbush | 2004 | p = 320}} A later study indicated that this contradicted Wilson and Kelling's proposition that disorder is an exogenous construct that has independent effects on how people feel about their neighborhoods.{{Sfn | Gau | Pratt | 2010}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

===Criminology===
According to some criminologists who speak of a broader "backlash,"{{Efn | The term "backlash" refers to the wave of "tough-on-crime" policies in the U.S. beginning in the 1980s.}} the broken windows theory is not theoretically sound.&lt;ref name= "Order Maintenance Reconsidered"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Thacher | first=David | year=2004 | url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7152&amp;context=jclc | title=Order Maintenance Reconsidered: Moving beyond Strong Causal Reasoning | format=PDF | publisher=Northwestern University School of Law | journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |volume=94 |issue=2 |doi=10.2307/3491374 | page=381| jstor=3491374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} They claim that the "broken windows theory" closely relates [[correlation]] with [[causality]], a reasoning prone to [[correlation does not imply causation|fallacy]]. David Thacher, assistant professor of public policy and urban planning at the [[University of Michigan]], stated in a 2004 paper:&lt;ref name= "Order Maintenance Reconsidered" /&gt;{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}
{{quote|[S]ocial science has not been kind to the broken windows theory. A number of scholars reanalyzed the initial studies that appeared to support it.... Others pressed forward with new, more sophisticated studies of the relationship between disorder and crime. The most prominent among them concluded that the relationship between disorder and serious crime is modest, and even that relationship is largely an artifact of more fundamental social forces.}}

It has also been argued that rates of major crimes also dropped in many other US cities during the 1990s, both those that had adopted broken windows policing and those that had not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Bernard E | last = Harcourt | title = Illusion of Order: The False Promise of Broken Windows Policing | publisher = Harvard | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-674-01590-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter 2006 edition of the ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'', [[Bernard Harcourt]] and Jens Ludwig looked at the later [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] program that rehoused inner-city project tenants in New York into more-orderly neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harcourt |first1 =Bernard E | last2 =Ludwig | first2 = Jens |ssrn= 743284 | title =Broken Windows: New Evidence from New York City and a Five-City Social Experiment |journal=University of Chicago Law Review |volume= 73 |year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broken windows theory would suggest that these tenants would commit less crime once moved because of the more stable conditions on the streets. However, Harcourt and Ludwig found that the tenants continued to commit crime at the same rate.

In a 2007 study called "Reefer Madness" in the journal ''Criminology and Public Policy'', Harcourt and Ludwig found further evidence confirming that [[regression toward the mean|mean reversion]] fully explained the changes in crime rates in the different precincts in New York in the 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harcourt|first=Bernard|last2=Ludwig|first2=Jens|year=2007|title=Reefer Madness: Broken Windows Policing and Misdemeanor Marijuana Arrests in New York City, 1989-2000|url=http://www3.law.columbia.edu/bharcourt/documents/marijuana-arrests.pdf|journal=Criminology and Public Policy|volume=6|pages=165–182|via=Columbia.edu|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9133.2007.00427.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further alternative explanations that have been put forward include the waning of the [[crack epidemic (United States)|crack epidemic]],&lt;ref name="SLATE1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2141424/ |last= Metcalf | first =Stephen |title=The Giuliani Presidency?

===Drawbacks in practice===
Broken windows policing has sometimes become associated with zealotry, which has led to critics suggesting that it encourages discriminatory behaviour. Some campaigns such as [[Black Lives Matter]] have called for an end to broken windows policing.&lt;ref name="NYT_campaignzero"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maloney|first1=Alli|title=When police turn violent, activists Brittany Packnett and Johnetta Elzie push back|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/09/29/when-police-turn-violent-activists-brittany-packnett-and-johnetta-elzie-push-back/|accessdate=December 18, 2016|agency=Women in the World|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] report argued that it had led the [[Baltimore Police Department]] discriminating against and alienating minority groups.

In response, Kelling and Bratton have argued that broken windows policing does not discriminate against law-abiding communities of minority groups if implemented properly.&lt;ref name="brattonkelling"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/why-we-need-broken-windows-policing-13696.html|title=Why we need Broken Windows policing|publisher=City Journal|author=William Bratton, George Kelling|date=December 2014|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cited ''Disorder and Decline: Crime and the Spiral of Decay in American Neighborhoods'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Wesley G | last = Skogan | title = Disorder and Decline: Crime and the Spiral of Decay in American Neighborhoods | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; a study by Wesley Skogan at the [[University of California]]. The study, which surveyed 13,000 residents of large cities, concluded that different ethnic groups have similar ideas as to what they would consider to be "disorder".

A low-level intervention of police in neighborhoods has been considered problematic. Accordingly, Gary Stewart wrote, "The central drawback of the approaches advanced by Wilson, Kelling, and Kennedy rests in their shared blindness to the potentially harmful impact of broad police discretion on minority communities."{{Sfn | Stewart | 1998}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}} It was seen by the authors, who worried that people would be arrested "for the 'crime' of being undesirable". According to Stewart, arguments for low-level police intervention, including the broken windows hypothesis, often act "as cover for [[racist]] behavior".{{Sfn | Stewart | 1998}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

A common criticism of broken policing is the argument that it criminalizes the poor and homeless. That is because the physical signs that characterize a neighborhood with the "disorder" that broken windows policing targets correlate with the socio-economic conditions of its inhabitants. Many of the acts that are considered legal but "disorderly" are often targeted in public settings and are not targeted when they are conducted in private. Therefore, those without access to a private space are often criminalized. Critics, such as [[Robert J. Sampson]] and [[Stephen Raudenbush]] of [[Harvard University]], see the application of the broken windows theory in policing as a war against the poor, as opposed to a war against more serious crimes.{{Sfn | Sampson | Raudenbush | 2004}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

In [[Dorothy Roberts]]'s article, "Foreword: Race, Vagueness, and the Social Meaning of Order Maintenance and Policing", she focuses on problems of the application of the broken windows theory, which lead to the criminalization of communities of color, who are typically disfranchised.&lt;ref name="Golub"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson|first=Bruce D. |author2=Golub, Andrew |author3=McCabe, James|title=The international implications of quality‐of‐life policing as practiced in New York City|journal=Police Practice and Research |date=1 February 2010 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=17–29 |doi=10.1080/15614260802586368|pmc=2847857 |pmid=20368765}}&lt;/ref&gt; She underscores the dangers of vaguely written ordinances that allows for law enforcers to determine who engages in disorderly acts, which, in turn, produce a racially skewed outcome in crime statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=Dorothy |title=Foreword: Race, Vagueness, and the Social Meaning of Order-Maintenance Policing|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |date=Spring 1999 |volume=89 |issue=3 |series=3|pages=775–836|jstor=1144123|doi=10.2307/1144123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bruce D. Johnson, Andrew Golub, and James McCabe, the application of the broken windows theory in policing and policymaking can result in development projects that decrease physical disorder but promote undesired [[gentrification]]. Often, when a city is so "improved" in this way, the development of an area can cause the cost of living to rise higher than residents can afford, which forces low-income people, often minorities, out of the area. As the space changes, the middle and upper classes, often white, begin to move into the area, resulting in the gentrification of urban, poor areas. The local residents are affected negatively by such an application of the broken windows theory and end up evicted from their homes as if their presence indirectly contributed to the area’s problem of "physical disorder".&lt;ref name="Golub"/&gt;

===Popular press===
In ''[[More Guns, Less Crime]]'' (University of Chicago Press, 2000), [[economist]] [[John Lott, Jr.]] examined the use of the broken windows approach as well as community- and [[problem-oriented policing]] programs in cities over 10,000 in population, over two decades. He found that the impacts of these policing policies were not very consistent across different types of crime. Lott's book has been [[More Guns, Less Crime#Studies Against|subject to criticism]], but [[More Guns, Less Crime#Support|other groups support]] Lott's conclusions.

In the 2005 book ''[[Freakonomics]]'', coauthors [[Steven D. Levitt]] and [[Stephen J. Dubner]] confirm and question the notion that the broken windows theory was responsible for New York's drop in crime, saying "the pool of potential criminals had dramatically shrunk". Levitt had in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' attributed that possibility to the legalization of abortion with ''[[Roe v.

[[California]]'s '''"Shine the Light" law''' (CA Civil Code § 1798.83&lt;ref name="cacode0"&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=civ&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1798.80-1798.84 CA Government Civil Code § 1798.83].  added 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cacode&gt;[http://law.justia.com/california/codes/2009/civ/1798.80-1798.84.html CA Civil Code § 1798.83]. Retrieved on 2011-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[privacy]] law passed by the [[California State Legislature]] in 2003. It became an active part of the [[California Civil Code]] on January 1, 2005. It is considered one of the first attempts by a [[State_legislature_(United_States)|state legislature]] in the [[United States]] to address the practice of sharing customers' [[personal information]] for marketing purposes, also known as "list brokerage."&lt;ref name=epic&gt;Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). [http://epic.org/privacy/profiling/sb27.html "California S.B. 27, 'Shine the Light" Law.']&lt;/ref&gt; The law outlines procedures requiring companies to disclose upon the request of a California resident what personal information has been shared with third parties, as well as the parties with which the information has been shared. The law also outlines specific language that companies who do business with California residents must include in their online [[privacy policies]].&lt;ref name=bizweek&gt;Nick Lieber.

==History==
The original bill, California S.B. 27, was introduced to the [[California State Senate]] by [[Liz Figueroa]] in December 2002.&lt;ref name=sb27&gt;California State Legislature. [http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/03-04/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_27_bill_20030925_chaptered.html Senate Bill 27, Chaptered version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829152343/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/03-04/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_27_bill_20030925_chaptered.html |date=2006-08-29 }}. Filed with CA Secretary of State on September 25, 2003. Retrieved on 11-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill's co-authors included State Senators Dede Alpert, [[Sheila Kuehl]], [[Gloria Romero (legislator)|Gloria Romero]], and [[Nell Soto]].

The bill arose out of increasing concern with business practices in which consumers' personal information, collected by the company with which a consumer engaged in business, was sold to other third-party companies without the knowledge of the consumer. In support of the bill, Figueroa's office offered the State Senate numerous examples of lists of personal information available for purchase on the Internet. Figueroa's office wrote:
{{quotation|Transparency is the touchstone of consumer confidence in information handling... Because privacy is, by definition, so intensely personal, for a consumer to make a rational and informed and personal choice to opt-in, opt-out, or simply take their business elsewhere, the consumer must know the 'who, what, where and when' of how a business handles personal information.&lt;ref name=billanalysis&gt;California Senate Judiciary Committee.[http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/03-04/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_27_cfa_20030916_115403_sen_comm.html Bill Analysis, SB 27 Senate Bill] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226020818/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/03-04/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_27_cfa_20030916_115403_sen_comm.html# |date=2008-12-26 }}, 2003. Retrieved on 2011-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
After approval in the Senate, the bill went to the [[California State Assembly]], where a number of concerns arose regarding "undue burden" placed on businesses.&lt;ref name=billanalysis&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The authors made several changes to address business interests, including the addition of a provision granting a business 90 days to "cure a violation" and an exemption for small businesses. Revisions also provided businesses the option to either respond to incoming requests from consumers who want to know how their information is being used or to allow users to opt out and "stop their information from being shared for marketing purposes."&lt;ref name=billanalysis&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was amended three times in the State Senate and five times in the State Assembly. It passed the Assembly on September 8, 2003 and the Senate on September 12, 2003. On September 24, 2003, [[Governor]] [[Gray Davis]] signed it into law. The bill became operative on January 1, 2005.&lt;ref name=bill-history&gt;{{cite web|title=SB 27 Complete Bill History|url=http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/03-04/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_27_bill_20030925_history.html|publisher=California State Senate|accessdate=2 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829105207/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/03-04/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_27_bill_20030925_history.html#|archive-date=2006-08-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
The law applies to all for-profit businesses that conduct business with any resident of California and have "shared customer personal information with other companies for their direct marketing use within the immediately preceding calendar year,"&lt;ref name=epic&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of businesses with fewer than 20 employees, federal financial institutions, non-profit organizations, political groups and politicians, providers of public real estate records, and credit reporting bureaus.&lt;ref name=prc&gt;Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. "[http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/SB27Release.htm California's "Shine the Light" Law Goes into Effect Jan. 1, 2005]." Press Release. Posted December 29, 2004. Retrieved on 11-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses that maintain a free and public privacy policy that allows users to opt into or [[opt-out|opt out]] of information sharing are also exempt. The law defines "customer" as "an individual who is a resident of California who provides personal information to a business during the creation of, or throughout the duration of, an established business relationship if the business relationship is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes."&lt;ref name=cacode&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A business does not need to be located in California, it simply needs to have a single customer who resides in the state.

===Personal information===
Under the "Shine the Light" law, California defines 27 categories as "personal information" when disclosed to third parties.&lt;ref name=cacode&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan="3" | Categories of personal information
|-
| Name and address || [[Email]] address || Age or date of birth
|-
| Names of children || Email or other addresses of children || Number of children
|-
| Age or gender of children || Height || Weight
|-
| Race || Religion || Occupation
|-
| Telephone number || Education || Political party affiliation
|-
| Medical condition || Drugs, therapies, or medical products or equipment used || Kind of product the customer purchased, leased, or rented
|-
| Real property purchased, leased, or rented || Kind of service provided || [[Social Security number]]
|-
| [[Bank account number]] || [[Credit card number]] || Debit card number
|-
| Bank or investment account, debit card or credit card balance || Payment history || Information pertaining to the customer's creditworthiness, assets, income, or liabilities
|}

===Notification and contact points===
The law requires that a business establish designated contact point—email address, a mailing address, or a phone or fax number—where they may direct Information-Sharing Disclosure requests. In addition, a business must do at least one of the following:
# Sufficiently provide to all employees who may have contact with consumers the contact points so that if a consumer asks about privacy practices, the employee can provide the contact information;
# Add a link on its home page titled "Your Privacy Rights" or "Your California Privacy Rights", or include one of those phrases in the same style as the heading "Privacy Policy" on a business's privacy policy page (linked from the business's home page). That section or separate "Your Privacy Rights" page must describe a customer's rights as outlined by the law and provide information to the consumer regarding the designated contact point;
# Clearly post or make available the contact information everywhere a customer interacts with the business's employees in California.&lt;ref name=cacode&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disclosure and violations===
Businesses must provide to the consumer a complete list of all personal information disclosed to third parties and the nature of that information within 30 days of the request (150 days if a request goes to another address or contact point that is not the designated contact point). However, the law requires a business to respond to requests from a single customer only once in a calendar year. The response must include the categories of information disclosed and the companies to which they were disclosed in the last calendar year.&lt;ref name=prc&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses with privacy policies of allowing users to opt in or opt out can respond to Information-Sharing Disclosure requests with the information on how to opt in or opt out.&lt;ref name=prc&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

If a business receives notice that they have failed to comply by submitting incomplete information or not responding to the request at all, the law provides a grace period of 90 days for them to provide complete information as requested.&lt;ref name=cacode&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, if a business fails to meet a consumer's request according to the law, that customer is entitled to recover civil damages of up to $500. If a company willfully fails to comply, the damages increase to up to $3,000 plus attorney's fees.&lt;ref name=prc&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rate of Compliance ==
Though the law officially went into effect on January 1, 2005, a 2009 independent study found evidence of uneven compliance. Researchers compiled a list of 112 businesses that were subject to SB 27 and did not supply an opt-out option that would exempt them from required disclosure. When these 112 businesses were served information sharing disclosure requests, only 59 of them responded as required by law.&lt;ref&gt; Lauren Thomas and Chris Jay Hoofnagle.

Its activities include investigating, reporting and litigating government misconduct, requesting and forcing government information disclosure through [[Freedom of information legislation|FOIA]] requests, and filing congressional ethics complaints against individuals, institutions and agencies.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About CREW|publisher=Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington|url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/pages/about|accessdate=May 16, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120905201513/http://www.citizensforethics.org/pages/about|archivedate=September 5, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OrgList"/&gt; Its projects have included the publication of "CREW's Most Corrupt Members of Congress", an annual report in which CREW lists the people it determines to be the [[Federal government of the United States]]'s most corrupt politicians. From 2005 and 2014 the annual reports named 25 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 63 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].

Since liberal Democratic operative [[David Brock]] became CREW's chairman in 2014, CREW has almost exclusively pursued investigations and litigation against Republicans and conservatives. Brock stepped down as the group's chairman in 2016 and was replaced by [[Richard Painter]], who went on to take a leave of absence to run as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in [[United States Senate special election in Minnesota, 2018|Minnesota's 2018 U.S. Senate special election]]. Under Painter's leadership, CREW has pursued aggressive litigation against the Trump administration, and as of January 2018 had filed 180 lawsuits against what it called the "most unethical presidency" in U.S. history.

==History==

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington was co-founded in 2003 by [[Norman L. Eisen]] and [[Melanie Sloan]] in part as a counterweight to conservative watchdog groups such as [[Judicial Watch]]. Sloan initially ran the fledgling organization by herself; by 2007, CREW had 13 staff members.&lt;ref name="burstyn"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Linda Burstyn|date=Winter 2007|title=The Most Feared Woman on Capitol Hill?|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/winter2007/2007-02-01-mostfearedwoman.asp|journal=MsMagazine.com|access-date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-span.org/video/?286316-1/qa-melanie-sloan Q&amp;A Interview with Melanie Sloan, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)]; CSPAN Transcripts; May 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the group had four lawyers on staff. During the presidency of George W. Bush, CREW filed 41 lawsuits, with about as many filed during the early years of [[Barack Obama]]'s presidency.&lt;ref name=gerstein/&gt;

===Chairmanships of David Brock and Richard Painter===

In August 2014, liberal political operative [[David Brock]] was elected chairman of CREW's board of directors. At the time, ''USA Today'' wrote that "One of the most vocal congressional ethics watchdog groups is becoming part of a Democratic political operation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Singer |first1=Paul |title=Ethics watchdog drops its non-partisan veneer |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2014/08/14/ethics-watchdog-drops-its-non-partisan-veneer/81232064/ |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=USA Today |date=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Politico'' wrote that Brock's newly announced involvement with CREW was a "major power play that aligns liberal muscle more fully behind the Democratic Party" and that CREW would add a "more politically oriented arm, expand its focus into state politics and donor targeting and will operate in close coordination with Brock's growing fleet of aggressive Democrat-backing nonprofits and super PACs — [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]], [[American Bridge 21st Century|American Bridge]], and the [[American Independent Institute]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vogel |first1=Kenneth |title=David Brock expands empire |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/david-brock-citizens-for-responsibility-and-ethics-in-washington-110003 |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=Politico |date=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Brock's involvement with CREW, the group had aggressively targeted Republican public officials as well as some Democrats. The [[Center for Public Integrity]] wrote that "Many key staffers left soon after Brock became its chairman, and since then, the organization has almost exclusively pursued Republicans and conservative organizations through federal complaints and its own investigations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levinthal |first1=David |title=Inside Hillary Clinton's big-money cavalry |url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/04/07/19528/inside-hillary-clintons-big-money-cavalry |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=Center for Public Integrity |date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, ''Bloomberg'' reported that Republicans had faced the vast majority of CREW investigations in recent months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Allison |first1=Bill |title=CREW’s Watchdog Status Fades After Arrival of Democrat David Brock |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-11/washington-watchdog-adjusts-to-life-with-partisan-roommates |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=Bloomberg |date=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brock left CREW's board of directors in December 2017, but did not cut ties with the group and continued to fundraise for it.&lt;ref name=gerstein&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gerstein |first1=Josh |title=Liberals cribbing from conservatives’ playbook to attack Trump |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/democrats-trump-resistance-conservative-playbook-232687 |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=Politico |date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by former [[George W. Bush]] White House ethics lawyer [[Richard Painter]], "lending the group a bipartisan air," according to ''Politico''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Debenedetti |first1=Gabriel |title=Brock groups set $40 million budget to fight Trump |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/david-brock-fundraising-trump-233974 |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=Politico |date=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painter took a leave of absence from CREW to run as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in [[United States Senate special election in Minnesota, 2018|Minnesota's 2018 U.S. Senate special election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kwong |first1=Jessica |title=Trump Has ‘No Respect For The Law,’ Former White House Ethics Lawyer Says |url=https://www.newsweek.com/trump-has-no-respect-law-former-white-house-ethics-lawyer-says-872503 |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=Newsweek |date=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, ''Politico'' wrote that after its 2003 founding, CREW had "quickly built a strong reputation as an ethics watchdog and transparency advocate, filing complaints against lawmakers from both parties, though the bulk of its ethics work targeted Republicans. However, in recent years CREW faced increased questions about its credibility, stemming from a 2014 shift that brought the group under Brock's sway and—in the eyes of many observers—into the Clinton orbit. Brock and his allies joined the group's board, while several longtime employees left." In 2015, CREW had revenue of just under $2.2 million. CREW filed just one lawsuit in 2015 and three in 2016, all asking the [[Federal Election Commission]] for stricter enforcement of campaign finance laws.&lt;ref name=gerstein/&gt;

===Trump administration===
CREW has aggressively targeted the [[Donald Trump]] administration, filing its first lawsuit against Trump three days after his inauguration as U.S. president. According to ''New York'' magazine, "Since then, it has been launching actions against the administration and its allies in Congress at a rate of about one a day, filing lawsuits and public-record inquiries and lodging complaints with authorities like the Office of Government Ethics." In June 2017, ''New York'' wrote that "CREW is officially nonpartisan, but it's a thin veneer. For the last few years, it has been loosely aligned with a network of organizations, including the super-PAC American Bridge, run by Democratic operative David Brock. After the election, Brock promised to 'kick Donald Trump's ass,' saying in a fund-raising document that CREW's litigation strategy would assure Trump would be 'afflicted by a steady flow of damaging information.'" CREW co-founder [[Norman L. Eisen]] rejoined CREW in December 2016 and set about distancing the organization from Brock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rice |first1=Andrew |title=Is Trump Inc. the President’s Greatest Vulnerability? |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/06/donald-trump-emoluments-clause-crew.html |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=New York |date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, CREW issued a 36-page report on Trump's presidency, calling it the "most unethical presidency" in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pasha-Robinson |first1=Lucy |title=Donald Trump presidency 'most unethical in modern history', report finds |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-white-house-unethical-us-president-ethics-crew-report-washington-dc-a8163401.html |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=The Independent |date=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, [[Environment &amp; Energy Publishing]] wrote that Painter was "at the center of more than 180 legal challenges to Trump and his administration as vice chairman of the left-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Northey |first1=Hannah |title=Former Bush ethics czar on the 'nerd resistance,' suing Trump |url=https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060072785 |accessdate=6 August 2018 |publisher=E&amp;E News |date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statements==
{{primary sources|section|date=August 2018}}
The organization's website says it is "dedicated to promoting ethics and accountability in government and public life by targeting government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests."&lt;ref name=about/&gt; The CREW mission statement has changed several times between 2005 and 2008 to de-emphasize its focus on personal litigation, dropping language that once read that CREW "differs from other good government groups in that it sues offending politicians directly" and that it "is a non-partisan legal watchdog group working to force our government officials to behave responsibly and ethically. CREW's mission is to use the legal system to expose government officials who betray the public interest by serving special interests. CREW aims to counterbalance the conservative legal watchdog groups that made such a strong impact over the past decade". It added that CREW "advances its mission using a combination of research, litigation and media outreach."&lt;ref name="RollCall"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040730122215/http://www.citizensforethics.org:80/ Original Mission Statement; website - 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the organization's mission stated, "CREW uses high-impact legal actions to target government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests &lt;small&gt;[...]&lt;/small&gt; we work to ensure government officials — regardless of party affiliation — act with honesty and integrity and merit the public trust."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizensforethics.org/pages/mission CREW Mission statement] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151202225914/http%3A//www.citizensforethics.org/pages/mission |date=2015-12-02 }}; CitizensForEthics.org; accessed December 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the organization's mission states, "Dedicated to fighting the influence of money on our political system. CREW uses aggressive legal action, in-depth research, and bold communications to reduce the influence of money in politics and help foster a government that is ethical and accountable. We highlight abuses, change behavior, and lay the groundwork for new policies and approaches that encourage public officials to work for the benefit of the people, not powerful interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=https://www.citizensforethics.org/|publisher=Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
According to the organization, its activities include litigation, [[Freedom of information legislation|FOIA]] requests, congressional ethics complaints, [[Internal Revenue Service]] complaints, [[Federal Election Commission]] complaints, and requests for investigation with government agencies.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

;CREW's Most Corrupt list
Each year since 2005, CREW has published its "Most Corrupt Members of Congress" report. The 2012 election cycle saw 11 of the 32 lawmakers included in the last two reports either defeated or retiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lipton|first=Eric|title=Ethics in Play, Voters Oust Incumbents Under Scrutiny|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/us/politics/voters-oust-lawmakers-accused-of-ethics-violations.html|accessdate=November 23, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the list had named 88 individuals, 63 of them Republicans and 25 Democrats.&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vogel|first1=Kenneth|title=David Brock expands empire|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/david-brock-citizens-for-responsibility-and-ethics-in-washington-110003|accessdate=11 November 2015|publisher=Politico|date=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130705063158/http://www.crewsmostcorrupt.org/mostcorrupt CREW's Most Corrupt Members of Congress]; CREW website&lt;/ref&gt;

;Family Affair report
In 2012, CREW released a report entitled ''Family Affair'', which examined how members of Congress had used their positions to benefit themselves and their families. The report included 248 members of the [[United States House of Representatives]], 105 Democrats and 143 Republicans, "about equal to their parties' proportional makeup in the House."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lipton|first=Eric|title=Study Shows How House Members and Families Reap Benefits|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/22/us/politics/study-shows-how-house-members-and-families-reap-benefits.html|accessdate=May 28, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common practices that do not appear to violate laws or House ethics rules but still raise ethical questions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Keefe|first=Ed|title=Study: Ron Paul's House seat enriches his family|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/study-ron-pauls-house-seat-enriches-his-family/2012/03/22/gIQAfHuSTS_blog.html|accessdate=May 28, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; include: paying family for congressional office and campaign work, collecting reimbursements from official US House and campaign budgets, earmarking to projects connected with family members, and charging interest on personal loans given to their campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bingham|first=Amy|title=House Members Give Their Families Millions in Campaign Cash|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/house-members-dole-out-millions-in-campaign-cash-to-families|accessdate=May 28, 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130414112615/http://www.citizensforethics.org/pages/family-affair-report-reveals-nepotism-abuse-in-congress/ Family Affair - Full report]; CREW website&lt;/ref&gt;

;FOIA requests for emails
In 2012, after learning that former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson had used an alias email account to conduct government business, CREW submitted an FOIA request for "records sufficient to show the number of email accounts of or associated with Secretary Hilary Rodham Clinton, and the extent to which those email accounts are identifiable as those of or associated with Secretary Clinton."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/116565335/FOIA-Request-CREW-Department-of-State-Regarding-Alias-Email-Accounts-12-6-2012 FOIA Request].

;Criticism of Continuing Appropriations Resolution
CREW raised questions about some of the content of the [[Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 (H.J.Res 59; 113th Congress)]]. One controversial provision of the bill was section 134, which stated that "notwithstanding any other provision of this joint resolution, there is appropriated for payment to Bonnie Englebardt Lautenberg, widow of [[Frank Lautenberg|Frank R. Lautenberg]], late a Senator from New Jersey, $174,000."&lt;ref name=money4widow1&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House spending bill includes $174,000 payment to deceased senator's widow|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/323725-house-spending-bill-includes-174000-payment-to-lautenbergs-widow|accessdate=September 23, 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CREW protested the inclusion of this in the bill, since Lautenberg's assets in 2011 were over $57 million. The group questioned why this "death gratuity" was considered a "top funding priority".&lt;ref name="money4widow1"/&gt;

;Emoluments Clause
{{see also|CREW v. Trump}}
A legal team representing CREW (including [[Laurence H. Tribe]], [[Norman L. Eisen]], [[Erwin Chemerinsky]], [[Richard Painter]], and [[Zephyr Teachout]]) announced its intention to file suit in federal court in New York on January 23, 2017, on the grounds that President [[Donald Trump]]'s business interests violate a provision in the [[Foreign Emoluments Clause|Emoluments Clause]] in [[United States Constitution|the Constitution]] by receiving payments from foreign government entities. The suit has asked the court to order Trump to stop receiving payments from foreign government via his hotels, golf courses, rentals and leased properties.&lt;ref name="NYT_Lipton_Liptak_2017"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/trump-foreign-payments-constitution-lawsuit.html|title=Foreign Payments to Trump Firms Violate Constitution, Suit Will Claim|author1=Eric Lipton|author2=Adam Liptak|date=January 22, 2017|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States District Judge [[George B.

CREW joined with the National Security Archive to challenge Trump's deletion of tweets as a violation of the Presidential Records Act of 1981.&lt;ref name="Trump sued for deleting tweets and White House use of encrypted messaging apps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/trump-lawsuit-watchdog-group-records-signal-confide-twitter-destroy-628281 |newspaper=Newsweek|date=2017-06-22|title=Trump sued for deleting tweets and White House use of encrypted messaging apps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
Norman L. Eisen, an attorney specializing in fraud, and eventual (in 2009) Special Counsel for Ethics and Government Reform in the White House, co-founded CREW in 2003. He became known for his stringent ethics and anti-corruption efforts, and for limiting registered lobbyists from taking positions in the administration.&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt;&lt;ref name="eli"&gt;{{cite news|title=When White House Has Queries About Ethics Rules, Adviser Norm Eisen Answers the Call|first=Eli|last=Saslow|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/12/AR2009031203748.html?sid=ST2009031204059|agency=[[The Washington Post]]|date=March 13, 2009|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melanie Sloan served as CREW's first executive director. In August 2014 former Republican activist and current Democratic activist [[David Brock]] was elected chairman of CREW's board, and Sloan announced her intention to resign as executive director, pending Brock's hiring of a new executive director. Prior to co-founding CREW in 2003, Sloan served as one of more than 300 Assistant [[U.S. Attorney]]s in the [[District of Columbia]] from 1998 to 2003 after having worked for congressional Democrats [[John Conyers]], [[Charles Schumer]], and [[Joseph Biden]].&lt;ref name=Staff&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington|title=CREW Crew|url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/about/staff|accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Penn]], pollster for [[Bill Gates]], [[Tony Blair]], both [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], also became a director and vice president at CREW.&lt;ref name="Sakol3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gerth|first1=Jeff|title=Her way: the hopes and ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton|year=2007|publisher=Little, Brown and Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-316-01742-8|page=267|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApFZJPP4zicC&amp;pg=PT212#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1st|last2=Van Natta, Jr.|first2=Don|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brock was elected as CREW's board president after laying out a broad plan to turn the organization into a more muscular organization.

==Allegations of partisanship==
CREW operates as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit prohibited from engaging in partisan activity. In 2010, [[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]] of ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'' described CREW's founding in 2003 as "one of a wave of new groups backed by liberal donors" and called CREW "a vehicle for assaults on largely – but not entirely – Republican targets",&lt;ref name=staffing&gt;Ben Smith, [http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1110/Staffing_up_for_Congressional_investigations.html "Staffing up for Congressional investigations"], Politico.com, November 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but a 2010 Associated Press story stated that CREW "has a history of targeting members of Congress representing different races, philosophies and both major parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGill|first=Kevin|title=Watchdog group seeks Senate probe of Vitter|url=http://www.sulphurdailynews.com/article/20100923/NEWS/309239969|accessdate=June 16, 2011|newspaper=Sulphur Daily News|agency=Associated Press|date=September 22, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130719153401/http://www.sulphurdailynews.com/article/20100923/NEWS/309239969|archivedate=July 19, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After CREW named him one of the "13 most corrupt members of Congress" in 2005, U.S. Senator [[Conrad Burns]] (R-MT) called the group "partisan hacks" and their allegations "maliciously false". The ''[[Billings Gazette]]'' reported that CREW defended itself:&lt;ref name="bill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/article_052d5c44-e769-5e49-a056-d9c85abc56a8.html|title=Burns calls 'corrupt' label from group 'maliciously false'|accessdate=2008-07-31|last=Johnson|first=Charles S.|date=2005-10-02|work=[[Billings Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naomi Seligman, the group's deputy director, said "We've gone after a fair number of Democrats, even in this study" [and Burns] "should be answering the charges, not slinging charges."

In 2006, ''[[Congressional Quarterly]]'' reported, "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has taken aim almost exclusively at GOP members of Congress. Since its founding in 2003, it [helped] investigate 21 lawmakers, only one of them a Democrat" (Senator [[Blanche Lincoln]] of Arkansas, in a complaint that also targeted Senator [[Bill Frist]] (R-TN), then Senate Majority Leader).&lt;ref name=TheHill0306&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|title=Watchdog's tax status, politics are questioned|newspaper=The Hill|date=March 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Quarterly Weekly'', volume 65, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; A report by ''[[McClatchy News Service]]'' called CREW "a Democratic-leaning watchdog group".&lt;ref name="McClatchy3"&gt;Greg Gordon,[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/incoming/article24458383.html "Congressman in tight race for re-election comes under federal investigation"], mcclatchydc.com, October 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'' quoted longtime Democratic pollster [[Celinda Lake]] as saying, "Corruption was a top issue in the [2006] midterm elections, and CREW was critical to the Democrats' success. The fact that they were bipartisan and had created this dirty-dozen list of corrupt politicians really helped people process that these politicians were acting well outside the norm."&lt;ref name="burstyn"/&gt;

The journal ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'' described CREW's former chief legal counsel, Anne Weismann, as "a Democrat-recommended witness and so the closest to an administration defender".&lt;ref name="Transparency"&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/467737-House_Republicans_Hammer_White_House_on_Transparency.php online "House Republicans Hammer White House on Transparency"], Broadcasting &amp; Cable magazine, May 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, CREW was described as "left-leaning" by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]''.

When asked in 2014 if CREW would continue pursuing complaints against Democrats, Brock responded, "No party has a monopoly on corruption and at this early juncture, we are not making categorical statements about anything that we will and won't do. Having said that, our experience has been that the vast amount of violations of the public trust can be found on the conservative side of the aisle."&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt; During a span of "recent months" in early 2016, Republicans were reportedly the target of the vast majority of CREW's campaign-finance allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Allison |first1=Bill |title=CREW’s Watchdog Status Fades After Arrival of Democrat David Brock |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-11/washington-watchdog-adjusts-to-life-with-partisan-roommates |accessdate=17 July 2018 |publisher=Bloomberg |date=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Roll Call'' article===
''[[Roll Call]]'' reported in January 2008 that CREW files most of its complaints against members of Congress, and "all but a handful ... have targeted Republicans". The article stated that CREW had issued press releases against Democrats but had usually not filed complaints against them, with the exception of now former Senator [[Mary Landrieu]] (D-LA), a conservative Democrat.&lt;ref name="RollCall"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/53_85/-21796-1.html|title=Watchdog, Donors Share Common Foes|accessdate=2010-04-02|last=Singer|first=Paul|date=2008-01-29|work=[[Roll Call]]|quote=CREW has named Democratic Reps. [[John Murtha]] (Pa.), [[Alan Mollohan]] (W.Va.) and [[Maxine Waters]] (Calif.) to its "most corrupt" list, but never has released a separate ethics complaint against any of them.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; CREW defended itself to ''Roll Call'':

{{quote|"CREW is a nonpartisan organization that targets unethical conduct", [Deputy Director Naomi] Seligman wrote... "Now that the Democrats are in power, they will have opportunities for corruption that were previously reserved to Republicans and it is likely we will see more Democratic corruption."}}

After the article was published, CREW stated that it was "baseless" and "omitted key facts". CREW suggested the ''Roll Call'' reporter had been prompted by a conversation with Landrieu, the target of a recent CREW lawsuit at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101202034914/http://citizensforethics.org/taxonomy/term/1200 CREW archives]; accessed November 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
''Roll Call'' reported that CREW doesn't disclose its donor list, and quoted former Deputy Director Naomi Seligman as saying that "donors play no role in CREW's decisions as to the groups or politicians we target."&lt;ref name="RollCall"/&gt; Donors to CREW have included such groups as [[Democracy Alliance]], [[Service Employees International Union]], the [[Arca Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcafoundation.org/history.htm Arca Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gill Foundation]].&lt;ref name=RollCall/&gt;&lt;ref name=ADG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2009/sep/24/inquiry-sought-ross-deal-20090924|title=Inquiry is sought in Ross deal|accessdate=2010-04-03|last=Daniels|first=Alex|date=2009-09-24|work=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/16/AR2006071600882_pf.html|title=A New Alliance Of Democrats Spreads Funding: But Some in Party Bristle At Secrecy and Liberal Tilt|accessdate=2010-04-04|last=VandeHei|first=Jim|date=2006-07-17|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, [[Democracy Alliance]] dropped a number of prominent organizations, including CREW, from their list of recommended organizations to receive donations. Support was withdrawn because these groups are more apt to work outside the Democratic Party's infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/28/democracy-alliance-dumps-_n_1306867.html|work=Huffington Post|first=Ryan|last=Grim|title=Liberal Donor Network Dumps Progressive Organizations|date=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Decisionism''' (derived from the [[German language|German]] ''Dezisionismus'', which is sometimes encountered untranslated in [[English language|English]] texts) is a [[politics|political]], [[ethics|ethical]] and [[jurisprudence|jurisprudential]] doctrine which states that moral or legal precepts are the product of decisions made by political or legal bodies. According to decisionism, it is not the content of the decision, but rather the fact that it is a decision made by the proper authority, or by using a correct method, which determines its validity.

In [[legal theory]], decisionism had a notable proponent in the German law scholar [[Carl Schmitt]]. Schmitt held that it is not the actual precepts of the law which determine its validity, but rather the fact that it has been made into law by the proper authority. Later in life, when Schmitt became a member of the [[NSDAP]], he used decisionism as a way of justifying [[Nazi]] policy, when he was quoted as saying "''[[Der Führer]]'' has made the law, ''der Führer'' protects the law".

[[File:Franklin Roosevelt signing declaration of war against Japan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signs the declaration of war against Japan on December 8, 1941]]
A '''[[declaration of war]]''' is a formal declaration issued by a national government indicating that a state of war exists between that nation and another.  The document [https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL31133.pdf Declarations of War and Authorizations for the Use of Military Force: Historical Background and Legal Implications] gives an extensive
listing and summary of statutes which are automatically engaged upon the US declaring war.

For the United States, [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article One, Section Eight]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] says "[[United States Congress|Congress]] shall have power to ... declare War." However, that passage provides no specific format for what form legislation must have in order to be considered a "[[declaration of war]]" nor does the Constitution itself use this term. In the courts, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]], in ''[[Doe v. Bush]]'', said: "[T]he text of the [[Iraq Resolution|October Resolution]] itself spells out justifications for a war and frames itself as an 'authorization' of such a war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Doe v. Bush'', 03-1266, (March 13, 2003)|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-1st-circuit/1171416.html|work=FindLaw|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in effect saying an authorization suffices for declaration and what some may view as a formal Congressional "Declaration of War" was not required by the Constitution.

The last time the United States formally declared war, using specific terminology, on any nation was in 1942, when war was declared against [[Axis powers#Subsequent signatories of the Tripartite Pact|Axis-allied]] Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, because President Franklin Roosevelt thought it was improper to engage in hostilities against a country without a formal declaration of war.  Since then, every American president has used military force without a declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Alistair, ''Alistair Cooke's America'', Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article will use the term "formal declaration of war" to mean Congressional legislation that uses the phrase "declaration of war" in the title. Elsewhere, this article will use the terms "authorized by Congress," "funded by Congress" or "undeclared war" to describe other such conflicts.

==History==
The United States has formally declared war against foreign nations five separate times, each upon prior request by the President of the United States. Four of those five declarations came after hostilities had begun.&lt;ref name="Henderson2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Phillip G. |title=The presidency then and now|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zscghb2szdAC|year=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9739-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zscghb2szdAC&amp;pg=PA51 51]}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Madison reported that in the Federal Convention of 1787, the phrase "make war" was changed to "declare war" in order to leave to the Executive the power to repel sudden attacks but not to commence war without the explicit approval of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_817.asp The Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 reported by James Madison : August 17]'',The Avalon Project, [http://www.law.yale.edu Yale Law School], retrieved Feb 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Debate continues as to the legal extent of the President's authority in this regard. Public opposition to American involvement in foreign wars, particularly during the 1930s, was expressed as support for a Constitutional Amendment that would require a national referendum on a declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/24200391|title=Petition for a Constitutional Amendment to Hold National Referendums on Declarations of War from Danville, Ohio|last=|first=|date=1938|website=|publisher=The National Archives of the United States|access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Constitutional Amendments, such as the [[Ludlow Amendment]], have been proposed that would require a national referendum on a declaration of war.

After Congress repealed the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] in January 1971 and President [[Richard Nixon]] continued to wage war in Vietnam, Congress passed the [[War Powers Resolution]] ({{USPL|93|148}}) over the veto of Nixon in an attempt to rein in some of the president's claimed powers. The War Powers Resolution proscribes the only power of the president to wage war which is recognized by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=War Powers: Return to Congress|url=https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/03/01/war_powers_return_them_to_congress_113136.html|accessdate=2 March 2018|agency=RealClear Media Group|publisher=RealClearDefense|date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declarations of war==

===Formal===
The table below lists the five wars in which the United States has formally declared war against eleven foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/WarDeclarationsbyCongress.htm Official Declarations of War by Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; The only country against which the United States has declared war more than once is Germany, against which the United States has declared war twice (though a case could be made for [[Hungary]] as a [[successor state]] to [[Austria-Hungary]]).

In World War II, the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], led respectively by [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]], declared war on the United States, and the U.S. Congress responded in kind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/11/newsid_3532000/3532401.stm BBC News, ''On This Day'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whereas the Government of Germany has formally declared war against the government and the people of the United States of America... the state of war between the United States and the Government of Germany which has thus been thrust upon the United States is hereby formally declared.

In the Senate, "when word reached the Senate that the invasion had gone forward before the use-of-force resolution had been approved, Republicans reacted angrily" saying it was a violation of the Constitution, but eventually after the action had already started, a resolution was passed after the action to "justify" it since Senators did not think it was a declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt;Cyrulik, John M., [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA416074 A Strategic Examination of the Punitive Expedition into Mexico, 1916-1917].

On at least 125 occasions, the President has acted without prior express military authorization from Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/2001/09/31/op-olc-v025-p0188_0.pdf  The President's Constitutional Authority To Conduct Military Operations Against Terrorists and Nations Supporting Them]&lt;/ref&gt; These include instances in which the United States fought in the [[Philippine–American War]] from 1898–1903, in [[Nicaragua]] in 1927, as well as the NATO bombing campaign of Yugoslavia in 1999, and the 2017 missile strikes on Syria. 

The United States' longest war was fought between 2001 and 2016 against the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan. 

The [[Indian Wars]] comprise at least 28 conflicts and engagements.  These localized conflicts, with Native Americans, began with European colonists coming to North America, long before the establishment of the United States. For the purpose of this discussion, the Indian Wars are defined as conflicts with the United States of America.  They begin as one front in the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1775 and had concluded by 1918. The [[United States Army]] still maintains a [[Campaign streamers|campaign streamer]] for [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Pine Ridge 1890–1891]] despite opposition from certain Native American groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncai.org/ncai/resource/documents/governance/wounkneeban.htm Army Continues to Parade Wounded Knee Battle Streamer], [http://www.ncai.org National Congress of American Indians].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil War]] was not an international conflict under the laws of war, because the [[Confederate States of America]] was not a government that had been granted full diplomatic recognition as a [[sovereignty|sovereign nation]] by other sovereign states.&lt;ref name="history-state-gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1861-1865/Confederacy |title=Preventing Diplomatic Recognition of the Confederacy, 1861–1865 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828005906/http://history.state.gov/milestones/1861-1865/Confederacy |archivedate=August 28, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McPherson"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bJEINL6bakYC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=confederacy+recognition|title=This Mighty Scourge: Perspectives on the Civil War |first=James M. |last=McPherson |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-531366-6 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSA was recognized by the United States government as a [[belligerent|belligerent power]], a different status of recognition that authorized Confederate warships to visit non-U.S. ports.  This recognition of the CSA's status as a belligerent power did not impose any duty upon the United States to recognize the sovereignty of the Confederacy, and the United States never did so.{{Citation needed|date = June 2018}}

==The War Powers Resolution==
{{main article|War Powers Resolution}}
In 1973, following the withdrawal of most American troops from the Vietnam War, a debate emerged about the extent of presidential power in deploying troops without a declaration of war. A compromise in the debate was reached with the [[War Powers Resolution]]. This act clearly defined how many soldiers could be deployed by the President of the United States and for how long. It also required formal reports by the President to Congress regarding the status of such deployments, and limited the total amount of time that American forces could be deployed without a formal declaration of war.

Although the constitutionality of the act has never been tested, it is usually followed, most notably during the [[Invasion of Grenada|Grenada Conflict]], the [[Operation Just Cause|Panamanian Conflict]], the [[Somalia Conflict]], the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], and the [[Iraq War]]{{clarify|date=August 2015}}.  The only exception was President Clinton's use of U.S. troops in the 78-day NATO air campaign against [[Yugoslavia]] during the [[Kosovo#Kosovo War|Kosovo War]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  In all other cases, the President asserted the constitutional authority to commit troops without the necessity of Congressional approval, but in each case the President received Congressional authorization that satisfied the provisions of the War Powers Act.

On March 21, 2011, a number of lawmakers expressed concern that the decision of President Barack Obama to order the U.S. military to join in attacks of [[Libya]]n air defenses and government forces exceeded his constitutional authority because the decision to authorize the attack was made without Congressional permission.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/world/africa/22powers.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss Obama Attacked for No Congressional Consent on Libya], [https://www.nytimes.com New York Times].&lt;/ref&gt; Obama explained his rationale in a two-page letter, stating that as commander in chief, he had constitutional authority to authorize the strikes, which would be limited in scope and duration, and necessary to prevent a humanitarian disaster in Libya.

'''Dessauite-(Y)''' is a mineral member of the crichtonite group with the formula (Sr,Pb)(Y,U)(Ti,Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;. It is associated with derbylite, hematite, rutile, [[karelianite]], [[siderite]], and [[calcite]]. Founded in the Buca della Vena Mine, Tuscany, Italy, the mineral was called dessauite in honor of professor Gabor Dessau (1907–1983).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.minsocam.org/msa/ammin/toc/Articles_Free/1997/Orlandi_p807-811_97.pdf|title = Dessauite, (Sr,Pb)(Y,U)(Ti,Fe3+)20O38, a new mineral of the crichtonite group from Buca della Vena mine, Tuscany, Italy.|last = Orlandi|first = Paolo|date = 1997|journal = Journal of the Mineralogical Society of America|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Structure==
Dessauite occurs as small, flattened rhombohedral crystals, tabular {001} with hexagonal outline. Members of the Crichtonite group may be confused with ilmenite or hematite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mindat.org/min-29190.html|title = Crichtonite Group|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between dessauite and other minerals in the crichonite group is the occurrence of three additional octahedral sites and of a site in square pyramidal coordination, all with low occupancies. The mineral is black and opaque, presents a metallic luster, and it is brittle. Dessauite presents dimensions of diameter up to 1mm and thickness up to 0.2mm. In reflected plane-polarized light the color is ash-grey with pale bluish tones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The calculated density is 4.68 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The habit is tabular, forming thin dimensions in one direction and hardness of 6.5 and 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dessauite Mineral Data|url = http://www.webmineral.com/data/Dessauite.shtml#.Vl8dlnarTIU|website = www.webmineral.com|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dessauite differs from other elements of the crichtonite group because of the quantity of cations and X-ray diffraction pattern.

==Occurrence==
Dessauite was found in the Buca della Vena Mine, Apuan Alps, northern Tuscany, Italy, with many other minerals, coming from hydrothermal fluids circulating through a small hematite-barite ore deposit within dolomite, during an alpine metamorphic event. It occurs in calcite veins hosted within dolomite and is associated with calcite, rutile, hematite, siderite, and derbylite.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <comment>/* DNA testing */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9011">A '''donor offspring''', or '''donor conceived person''', is conceived via the donation of [[sperm]] ([[sperm donation]]) or [[Ovum|ova]] ([[egg donation]]), or both, either from two separate donors or from a couple.  In the case of [[embryo]] donation, the conceiving parents are a couple.

Donor conceived people may never learn of their true birth origins as information about their true [[biological parent]](s) is not recorded on the birth certificate. However, many can get information through DNA testing. Donor conceived people may have many half siblings as a result of the same person's donations.

With the significant increase in the numbers of donor-conceived individuals (38,910 live babies were born in 2005 as a result of 134,260 ART cycles performed at reporting U.S. clinics in 2005, compared with 20,659 babies born as a result of 64,036 ART cycles in 1996), many have questioned the ethics surrounding the technologies and human decisions surrounding donor conception, and there has been plenty of controversy.  For example, the term "[[Snowflake baby]]" was coined in reference to unused frozen embryos (left over from other couples' attempts to conceive through in vitro fertilization) that have been "adopted" by families. Pro-life advocates tend to support such adoptions.

"ART Cycles" are not accurate as many people (&lt;40%) who use IVF (egg donation) do not report their births 2012 Asia Pacific Journal of Reproduction: Donor type and parental disclosure following oocyte donation. (2012) 39-45. Volume 1, Number 1&gt;, and that there is no tracking or record keeping required for children born from sperm donation.  Estimates of 30,000-60,000 often used are from estimates made with incomplete records from the mid 1980s. Artificial Insemination: Practice in the United States: Summary of a 1987 Survey Office of Technology Assessment | 1988].

==Psychological and social==
{{Further|Sperm donation#psychological}}
{{Further|Egg donation#Psychological and social issues}}
The psychological and social impacts of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) on donor-conceived children and their families has gained a great deal of interest in recent years as this population has continued to grow. An increasing number of family-support organizations strongly encourage parents to openly discuss their children's origins, whether through donor insemination or following treatment with donated gametes.

Donor conceived people have fewer adolescence problems than children of [[divorce]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/19/magazine/319dad.html?pagewanted=10&amp;_r=1 Wanted: A Few Good Sperm] nytimes.com Published: March 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

For most sperm or egg recipients, the choice between [[anonymous sperm donor|anonymous sperm or egg donor]] and a non-anonymous one is generally not of major importance.&lt;ref name=werner&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ekerhovd E, Faurskov A, Werner C |title=Swedish sperm donors have been said to be driven by altruism, but shortage of sperm donors leads to reproductive travelling |journal=Ups. J. Med. Sci. |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=305–13 |year=2008 |pmid=18991243 |doi= 10.3109/2000-1967-241|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some donor conceived children, on the other hand, it may be psychologically burdensome not having the possibility of contacting or knowing almost nothing about the biological father.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonpress.com/2008-11-06/news/donor-babies-search-for-their-anonymous-fathers/1 Donor Babies Search for Their Anonymous Fathers.] By Craig Malisow. Published on November 04, 2008 at 11:22am&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far, studies have found that a significant number of donor conceived children want information about their biological father.&lt;ref name="werner"/&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&amp;sheib&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3439954/Sperm-donors-should-get-cut-price-IVF-to-tackle-shortage.html Telegraph.co.uk: Sperm donors should get cut-price IVF to tackle shortage] By Rebecca Smith, Medical Editor in San Francisco. Last Updated: 4:12PM GMT 11 November 2008. This ref, in turn, cites Dr Joanna Sheib from the University of California Davis&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming forward publicly with problems is difficult for donor-conceived people as these issues are very personal and a public statement may attract criticism but ultimately are the only remaining option in activism on the issue. Additionally, it may upset their parents if they speak out. A website called Anonymous Us [http://anonymousus.org/stories/index.php?cid=2] has been set up where they can post details of their experiences anonymously, on which there are many accounts of problems.

==Donor and sibling tracking==
There are donor sibling registries matching genetic siblings and donors. However, with modern information technology, there are other ways of getting information.

One study estimated that approximately 67% of donor conceived children in [[adolescence]] with an identity-release donor plan on contacting him when they turn 18 years.&lt;ref name="IlioiGolombok2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilioi|first1=E. C.|last2=Golombok|first2=S.|title=Psychological adjustment in adolescents conceived by assisted reproduction techniques: a systematic review|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=21|issue=1|year=2014|pages=84–96|issn=1355-4786|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu051|pmid=25281685|pmc=4255607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Registries===
{{Main|Donor registration}}
A donor registrations facilitate donor conceived people, [[sperm donor]]s and [[egg donor]]s to establish contact with genetic kindreds. They are mostly used by donor conceived people to find genetic half-siblings from the same egg- or sperm donor.

Some donors are non-anonymous, but most are anonymous, i.e. the donor conceived person doesn't know the true identity of the donor. Still, he/she may get the donor number from the fertility clinic. If that donor had donated before, then other donor conceived people with the same donor number are thus genetic half-siblings. In short, donor registries matches people who type in the same donor number.

Alternatively, if the donor number isn't available, then known donor characteristics, e.g. hair, eye and skin color may be used in matching siblings.

===Clinics or sperm banks===
{{Further|Sperm donation#Anonymity}}
Many clinics and sperm banks offer non-anonymous donors, such as where the donor conceived person may get the identity of the donor.

However, an Australian study came to the result that potential donors who would still be willing to donate without a guarantee of anonymity were not automatically more open to initiate or extended contact with offspring.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Den Broeck | first1 = U. | last2 = Vandermeeren | first2 = M. | last3 = Vanderschueren | first3 = D. | last4 = Enzlin | first4 = P. | last5 = Demyttenaere | first5 = K. | last6 = d'Hooghe | first6 = T. | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms039 | title = A systematic review of sperm donors: Demographic characteristics, attitudes, motives and experiences of the process of sperm donation | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–51 | year = 2012 | pmid =  23146866| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most potential donors would be willing to meet offspring in a single contact.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

===DNA testing===
However, even sperm donors who have not initiated contact through a registry are now increasingly being traced by their offspring, and in the current era there can be no such thing as guaranteed anonymity. Through the advent of [[genetic genealogy]] and [[DNA databases]], it is now possible for "anonymous" sperm donors to be identified.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/wendy-kramer/dna-donors-not-anonymous_1_b_8646164.html DNA = Donors Not Anonymous] huffingtonpost.com Published: November 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly the first such case was in 2005, when it was revealed in New Scientist magazine that an enterprising 15-year-old used information from a DNA test and the internet to identify and contact his genetic father, who was a sperm donor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/sex/mg18825244.200-anonymous-sperm-donor-traced-on-internet.html Anonymous sperm donor traced on internet] newscientist.com Published: November 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, it was reported that DNA testing has led to a significant increase in donor-conceived people finding their siblings and sperm donors. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sperm-donor-dad-when-strangers-shared-dna-become-family-n937366 From sperm donor to 'Dad': When strangers with shared DNA become a family]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ford administration]] forbade assassination in 1976 with [[Executive Order 11905]].  A ''[[Washington Post]]'' article, c. 1989{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}{{Verify source|date=January 2010}}, may have reported that a "secret" ruling of the [[U.S. Department of State]]'s Office of Legal Advisor had interpreted that Ford's Executive Order only banned ''intentional'' killings of foreign leaders, thus clearing the way for "accidental" killings of foreign leaders; for example, during the confusion of a coup or invasion. Since this ruling was one of at least four preceding the [[United States invasion of Panama|U.S. invasion of Panama]], some{{Who|date=January 2010}} saw the ruling as giving a green light for [[Manuel Noriega]] to be killed "accidentally". Noriega survived the invasion and surrendered to US forces.

The CIA started to use [[UAVs in the U.S. military|drone strikes]] for [[targeted killing]] under President [[George W. Bush]] in 2001, during the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/05/america-first-drone-strike-afghanistan/394463/ The Story of America's Very First Drone Strike]&lt;/ref&gt; It lost authority to do so by order of President [[Barack Obama]], but regained it again under President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2017/03/14/520162910/trump-restores-cia-power-to-launch-drone-strikes Trump Restores CIA Power To Launch Drone Strikes]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Facts on the ground''' is a diplomatic and [[geopolitical]] term that means the situation in reality as opposed to in the abstract.{{sfn||Berridge|Lloyd|2012|p=105}}

The term was popularised in the 1970s in discussions of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]{{sfn|Blok|Lardinois|2006|p=442}} to refer to [[Israeli settlements]] built in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied]] [[West Bank]], which were intended to establish permanent Israeli footholds in Palestinian territory.{{sfn|Rosen|2007}}

[[Rashid Khalidi]] wrote in 2010: 
{{quote|One reason Israel continues to build settlements is that, according to the so-called [[The Clinton Parameters|Clinton parameters]] laid down in 2000, a final Israeli–Palestinian agreement would grant sovereignty over Jewish-occupied areas to Israel, and Palestinian-inhabited areas to the new Palestinian state. Indeed, well over a decade of failed negotiations have only led to an acceleration of Israel’s land grab in the Holy City. Israeli planners have spent this time pushing settlers into heavily Arab-inhabited areas of the city, such as [[Sheikh Jarrah]], [[Silwan]], and [[Abu Dis]], in order to create fresh "facts on the ground"—a tactic used by the Zionist movement for over a century in order to obtain control over more and more of Palestine.{{sfn|Khalidi|2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2327">The '''Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation''' ('''FSLIC''') was an institution that administered [[deposit insurance]] for [[savings and loan]] institutions in the [[United States]].  The [[Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989]] (FIRREA) abolished it and transferred the responsibility for savings and loan deposit insurance to the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC). The FSLIC Resolution Fund was created to assume all the assets and liabilities of the FSLIC, which was to be funded by the [[Financing Corporation]] (FICO).

==History==
The FSLIC was administered by the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, during the [[savings and loan crisis]], the FSLIC became insolvent.  It was recapitalized with taxpayer money several times, with $15 billion in 1986 and $10.75 billion in 1987; however, by 1989 it was too insolvent to save. Pursuant to the [[Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989]] (FIRREA), the FSLIC was abolished along with the FHLBB, and the FSLIC savings and loan deposit insurance responsibility was transferred to the FDIC. The FSLIC Resolution Fund was created to assume all the assets and liabilities of the FSLIC, which was to be funded by the [[Financing Corporation]] (FICO).

From Antiquity to the Modern Era
D. T. Potts&lt;/ref&gt; whose heartland is divided between [[Ilam Province|Ilam]], Kermanshah, and [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]] provinces in [[Iran]] and the eastern parts of [[Diyala Governorate]] and [[Wasit Governorate]] in [[Iraq]]. They speak the Feyli dialect of [[Southern Kurdish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kurdish, Southern|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/sdh|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''A Memoir of Baghdad'' (issued by Al-Rais publishing house, in Cyprus in 1993), the ex-minister [[Mosa Al-Shabandar]] describes the life of the Feylis.

== Feyli homeland ==
Since ancient times, the Feylis have lived in the border area between [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]], which consists of both sides of the [[Zagros Mountains]], which they call it [[Kabir Kuh]], "the great mountain".  The areas on the Iraqi side from north to south are the following: some parts of Shahraban (now called [[Al-Meqdadia]]), [[Khaneqin]], [[Mandali, Iraq|Mandali]], [[Badrah]], [[Zorbateyah]], [[Jassan]], Al–[[Kut]] and Al-[[Azizyah]]. They also reside in a number of cities in the area of [[Shaikh Sa’ad]], [[Ali Sharqi]], [[Ali Gharbi]] and [[Al–Kofah]], which is {{convert|170|km|mi}} south of [[Baghdad]]. However, as early as the first decade of the 20th century, many Feylis moved to Baghdad and lived in its center. Consequently, there are some areas which are named after them, such as the Kurdish quarter, the Kurdish alley, and the Kurdish Street.On the Iranian side, the Feylis live in the following areas, from north to south: [[Kermanshah Province|Kermanshah]], [[Qasre Shirin]], [[Eslamabad e Gharb]], [[Ghilan e Gharb]], [[Eyvan]], [[Sirvan]], [[Chardavol]], [[Ilam Province|Ilam]], [[Chavar]], [[Badreh]], [[Dehloran]], [[Abdanan]], [[Darreh Shahr]], [[Meymeh, Ilam|Meymeh]], [[Pahleh]] .

== The Feylis in Iraqi society ==
The existence of the Feylis in Iraq has never been marginal. On the contrary, they have participated in all political, social, cultural, and economical activities.

=== Deportation from Iraq during the Saddam Hussein era ===
The Feylis were seen highly suspiciously by the Baathist regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Library/ publications |title=REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/print_2194.html |website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the targeted families were of significant influence on a large spectrum of Iraqi society. Having a high level of education, commercial success and ranking positions in the military. The Baathist regime fearing potential dissidence and opposition, implemented deportation policies against Feylis. The official claim was that Feylis were Iranian nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Refugees |first1=United Nations High Commissioner for |title=Refworld {{!}} Iraq: Information on the Kurdish Feyli (Faily/Falli) families, including their main area of residence and their relationship with other Kurdish groups and the Iraqi regime |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ac008.html |website=Refworld |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joost Hiltermann points to the old [[Safavid]]–[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] struggle, as the leadership of each country used religious references to characterize themselves, their enemies and their battles, unfailingly casting these in sectarian terms. One group of victims of this practice was the Feylis, whose members were deported by Saddam Hussein’s regime to Iran on the grounds that, supposedly, they were basically Persians. It was no coincidence, however, that Feylis are also Shiites. Feylis were not the only Iraqi Shiites to be deported to Iran, either during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] or before it. The practice affected any Iraqi Shiites who were listed in Iraq’s population register as ‘‘of Persian origin’’ (taba’iya Faresiya), as opposed to ‘‘of Ottoman origin’’ (taba’iya Othmaniya). This designation stemmed from Ottoman times, when citizens who sought to evade extended military service used a Persian ancestor to claim they were not Ottoman subjects. The modern Iraqi state inherited this system in the early 1920s. Post-1958 republican regimes used it as the basis for deportation policies designed to serve political agendas.&lt;ref&gt;Hiltermann, J. (2007). A new sectarian threat in the Middle East?. International Review of the Red Cross, 89(868), 795-808.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Iraqi Ministry of Displacement and Migration reported that since 2003 about 100,000 Feylis have had their citizenship reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Faili Kurds of Iraq: Thirty Years Without Nationality|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/faili-kurds-iraq-thirty-years-without-nationality|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=ReliefWeb|date=2 April 2010|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010 Trial of Baathists involved in crimes against Feylis ===
On Monday 29 November 2010, an Iraqi court found Saddam Hussein's longtime foreign minister [[Tariq Aziz]] guilty of terrorizing Feylis during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (see [[Kurdish rebellion of 1983]] and [[Al-Anfal Campaign]]), sentencing him to 10 years in prison. Mohammed Abdul Saheb, a spokesman for [[Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal|Iraq's high criminal court]], said: "Today a judge found Tariq Aziz guilty and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. The evidence was enough to convict him of displacing and killing Feyli Kurds. Aziz was a member of the revolutionary command council which cancelled the Iraqi nationality for many of the Feyli Kurds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chulov |first1=Martin |title=Tariq Aziz given additional 10-year jail term for persecution of Shia Kurds |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/29/tariq-aziz-iraq-sentence-kurds |website=the Guardian |language=en |date=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spokesman also said Aziz was spared a death sentence for the crimes against humanity because he had a lesser involvement than some of his co-defendants in the atrocities against the Feyli Kurds.&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101129/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iraq Iraq court gives Tariq Aziz new 10 year sentence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204045811/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101129/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iraq |date=December 4, 2010}}, Associated Press via [[Yahoo! News]]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the other 15 defendants in the Iraqi High Tribunal case, three Saddam Hussein loyalists were found guilty and sentenced to death. Two, including Aziz, were sentenced to 10 years in prison. The remaining 10 were acquitted, including Hussein's two half brothers, [[Watban Ibrahim al-Hassan]] and [[Sabbawi Ibrahim al-Hassan]]. The Feyli Kurd minority comes mainly from an area in northeastern Iraq that straddles the Iran–Iraq border. Saddam Hussein's regime killed, detained and deported tens of thousands of Feylis early in his 1980–1988 war with Iran, denouncing them as alien Persians and spies for the Iranians.&lt;ref name="yahoo" /&gt;

=== 2011 Feyli Conference in Baghdad ===
On Saturday the first of October 2011, the National Conference for Feyli Kurds held a conference in the Iraqi capital Baghdad which was attended by the Iraqi Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]]. Al-Maliki said in a speech "the Feyli Kurds have been targets for harming, similar to other Iraqi communities". He also called "for the unity of Feyli Kurds under a common tent, uniting them and organizing their activities, together with other Iraqi communities". He ended his speech by saying "we shall support the rights of the Feyli Kurds, beginning with the restoration of their official documents and their presence in their homeland and ending with the paying back the funds that were confiscated from them (during the former regime)". The Iraqi Prime Minister also recognized "that over 22,000 Feyli Kurds had been deported from Iraq by the former regime, calling for the restoration of their rights".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130218031529/http://en.aswataliraq.info/(S(baay1uqnw0tufz45vywvsd45))/Default.aspx?page=article_page&amp;c=slideshow&amp;id=145102 Aswat al-Iraq | Over 22,000 Iraq’s Faili Kurds deported by former regime, Maliki says&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 UNHCR report on stateless people residing inside Iraq ===
An estimated 120,000 persons are believed to be stateless in Iraq as of 2012. These are mainly Kurds, including some Feylias. This figure is gradually decreasing with increasing numbers of Feylis regaining their Iraqi citizenship in accordance with the Nationality Law of 2006. UNHCR is assisting in the identification of stateless persons, raising awareness about their problems and facilitating their access to IDs and other legal documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iauiraq.org/documents/1773/June%202012%20fact%20sheet.pdf Inter-Agency Information and Analysis Unit | UNHCR Iraq Fact Sheet June, 2012&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022214957/http://www.iauiraq.org/documents/1773/June%202012%20fact%20sheet.pdf |date=October 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Governors’ Climate and Forests Task Force''' ('''GCF Task Force''') is a sub-national collaboration between 38 states and provinces  from Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Spain, and the United States. The Task Force is designed to support jurisdictional approaches to low emissions rural development and [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation|reduced emissions from deforestation and land use (REDD+)]], specifically through performance-based payment schemes and national or state-based greenhouse gas (GHG) compliance regimes.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=GCF Overview|url=http://www.gcftaskforce.org/about|website=Governors' Climate &amp; Forests Task Force|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Task Force was initiated by former California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on November 18, 2008 at the Governors’ Climate Change Summit in Los Angeles, California. At this summit the U.S. states of California, Illinois, and Wisconsin,{{efn|name="nonmember"|As of 2011, Wisconsin is no longer a GCF member.&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt;}} the Brazilian states of Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, and Pará, and the Indonesian provinces of Aceh and Papua signed [http://www.testing.gcftaskforce.org/about/documents/ memoranda of understanding (MOUs)] supporting cooperation on a number of issues related to climate policy, financing, technological cooperation, and research. These MOUs also called for the creation of a Joint Action Plan to provide a framework for implementing the MOUs in the forest section. The GCF Task Force held its first international meeting in 2009 in Belem, Brazil, where it approved its Joint Action Plan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27860">This is a '''history of laws concerning [[Immigration to the United States|immigration and naturalization in the United States]]'''. Immigration is distinct from naturalization. For the first century of the United States' history, immigration to the country was unrestricted. Anyone could move into the United States, start a new life, pay taxes, participate in military service and conduct business. However, while the United States had an "open-borders" policy for the first century of its existence, meaning anyone could immigrate into the country without any restrictions, it had very clear naturalization laws from the first years of its existence. Anyone who wanted to vote or hold elective office had to be naturalized. That is, anyone could immigrate in, but only those who went through the naturalization process and became a citizen could vote or hold elective office. 

This set of policies, in which open immigration was permitted, but naturalization was tightly controlled, persisted until the 1870s and 1880s, when growing support for eugenics eventually drove the US government to adopt immigration laws. These laws were intended to end the open immigration policy which the Founding Fathers had permitted, in favor of preventing "racial taint" from immigrants who entered from undesirable countries.

==18th century==
The [[United States Constitution]] was adopted on September 17, 1787. [[Article I of the US Constitution#Enumerated powers|Article I, section 8, clause 4]] of the Constitution expressly gives the [[United States Congress]] the power to establish a uniform rule of [[naturalization]].&lt;ref&gt;The relevant enumerated power reads: "To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Pursuant to this power, Congress in 1790 passed the first naturalization law for the United States, the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]]. The law enabled those who had resided in the country for two years and had kept their current state of residence for a year to apply for citizenship. However it restricted naturalization to "free white persons" of "[[good moral character]]".

The [[Naturalization Act of 1795]] increased the residency requirement to five years residence and added a requirement to give a three years notice of intention to apply for citizenship, and the [[Naturalization Act of 1798]] further increased the residency requirement to 14 years and required five years notice of intent to apply for citizenship.

==19th century==
The [[Naturalization Law of 1802]] repealed the Naturalization Act of 1798.

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], passed in 1868, protects children born in the United States. The phrase: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside" was interpreted by the Supreme Court in the 1898 case ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'' as covering everyone born in the U.S. to parents who had at the time a permanent domicile and residence in the United States, regardless of the parents' citizenship, with the exception of the children of diplomats and Native Americans. See the articles ''[[jus soli]]'' (birthplace) and ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (bloodline) for further discussion.
 
In 1870, the law was broadened to allow [[African Americans|blacks]] to be naturalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2002/summer/immigration-law-1.html| work=National Archives | title= Race, Nationality, and Reality: INS Administration of Racial Provisions in U.S. Immigration and Nationality Law Since 1898, Part 1| accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asia]]n immigrants were excluded from naturalization but not from living in the United States.  There were also significant restrictions on some Asians at the state level; in [[California]], for example, non-citizen Asians were not allowed to own land.

After the immigration of 123,000 [[China|Chinese]] in the 1870s, who joined the 105,000 who had immigrated between 1850 and 1870, Congress passed the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] in 1882 which targeted a single ethnic group by specifically limiting further Chinese immigration.  Chinese had immigrated to the Western United States as a result of unsettled conditions in China, the availability of jobs working on railroads, and the [[Gold Rush]] that was going on at that time in California. The expression "[[Yellow Peril]]" became popular at this time.

The act excluded Chinese laborers from immigrating to the United States for ten years and was the first immigration law passed by Congress.  Laborers in the United States and laborers with work visas received a certificate of residency and were allowed to travel in and out of the United States.  Amendments made in 1884 tightened the provisions that allowed previous immigrants to leave and return, and clarified that the law applied to ethnic Chinese regardless of their country of origin. The act was renewed in 1892 by the [[Geary Act]] for another ten years, and in 1902 with no terminal date. It was repealed in 1943, although large scale Chinese immigration did not occur until 1965.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==20th century==
The [[Japan|Empire of Japan]]'s State Department negotiated the so-called [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|Gentlemen's Agreement]] in 1907, a protocol where Japan agreed to stop issuing passports to its citizens who wanted to emigrate to the United States. In practice, the Japanese government compromised with its prospective emigrants and continued to give passports to the Territory of Hawaii where many Japanese resided. Once in [[Hawaii]], it was easy for the Japanese to continue on to Japanese settlements on the west coast if they so desired. In the decade of 1901 to 1910, 129,000 Japanese immigrated to the United States or Hawaii; nearly all were males and on five-year work contracts and 117,000 more came in the decades from 1911 to 1930. How many of them stayed and how many returned at the end of their contracts is unknown but it is estimated that about one-half returned. Again this immigrant flow was at least 80% male and the demand for female Japanese immigrants almost immediately arose. This need was met in part by what are called "postcard wives" who immigrated to new husbands who had chosen them on the basis of their pictures (similar marriages also occurred in nearly all cultures throughout the female-scarce west). The Japanese government finally quit issuing passports to the Territory of Hawaii for single women in the 1920s.

Congress also banned persons because of poor health or lack of education. An 1882 law banned entry of "lunatics" and infectious disease carriers. After President [[William McKinley]] was [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassinated]] by an anarchist of immigrant parentage, Congress enacted the Anarchist Exclusion Act in 1901 to exclude known anarchist agitators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/timeline.html| work= [[Harvard University Library]] Open Collections Program| title= Key Dates and Landmarks in United States Immigration History| accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A literacy requirement was added in the [[Immigration Act of 1917]].

In 1921 the United States Congress passed the [[Emergency Quota Act]], which established national immigration quotas. The quotas were based on the number of foreign-born residents of each nationality who were living in the United States as of the 1910 census.

The crucial 1923 Supreme Court case ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]'' created the official stance to classify South Asian [[Indian people|Indians]] as non-white, which at the time allowed Indians who had already been naturalized to be retroactively stripped of their citizenship after prosecutors argued that they had gained their citizenship illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coulson|first1=Doug|title=British Imperialism, the Indian Independence Movement, and the Racial Eligibility Provisions of the Naturalization Act: United States v. Thind Revisited|journal=Georgetown Journal of Law &amp; Modern Critical Race Perspectives|date=2015|volume=7|pages=1–42|ssrn=2610266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[California Alien Land Law of 1913]], overturned in 1952 by the holding in Sei Fujii v. California, 38 Cal. 2d 718, and other similar laws [[Alien land laws|prohibited aliens from owning land]] property, thus effectively stripping [[Indian Americans]] of land rights. While the decision was placating [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] (AEL) demands, spurned by growing outrage at the Turban Tide/Hindoo Invasion [sic] alongside the pre-existing outrage at the "[[Yellow Peril]]", and while more recent legislation influenced by the civil-rights movement has removed much of the statutory discrimination against Asians, no case has overturned this 1923 classification.

A more complex quota plan, the [[National Origins Formula]], replaced this "emergency" system under the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] (Johnson-Reed Act). The reference census used was changed to that of 1890, which greatly reduced the number of Southern and Eastern European immigrants. An annual ceiling of 154,227 was set for the Eastern Hemisphere. Each country had a quota proportional to its population in the U.S. as of the 1890 census.

In 1932 [[President Hoover]] and the State Department essentially shut down immigration during the [[Great Depression]] as immigration went from 236,000 in 1929 to 23,000 in 1933. This was accompanied by voluntary repatriation to Europe and Mexico, and coerced repatriation and deportation of between 500,000 and 2&amp;nbsp;million [[Mexican Americans]], mostly citizens, in the [[Mexican Repatriation]]. Total immigration in the decade of 1931 to 1940 was 528,000 averaging less than 53,000 a year.

The Chinese exclusion laws were repealed in 1943. The [[Luce-Celler Act of 1946]] ended discrimination against Indian Americans and Filipinos, who were accorded the right to naturalization, and allowed a quota of 100 immigrants per year.

The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] (the McCarran-Walter Act) revised the quotas again, basing them on the 1920 census. For the first time in American history, racial distinctions were omitted from the U.S. Code. As could be expected, most of the quota allocation went to immigrants from [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]] who already had relatives in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The anti-subversive features of this law are still in force.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

===1960s===
The [[Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965]] (the Hart-Celler Act) abolished the system of national-origin quotas. There was, for the first time, a limitation on Western Hemisphere immigration (120,000 per year), with the Eastern Hemisphere limited to 170,000. The law changed the preference system for immigrants.  Specifically, the law provided preference to immigrants with skills needed in the U.S. workforce, refugees and asylum seekers, as well as family members of U.S. citizens. Family reunification became the cornerstone of the bill. 
At the time, the then-chairman of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee [[Edward Kennedy]] remarked that "the bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs." (U.S. Senate, Subcommittee on Immigration and Naturalization of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Committee on the Judiciary]], Washington, D.C., Feb. 10, 1965. pp.&amp;nbsp;1–3.)

===1980s===
The [[Refugee Act]] of 1980 established policies for [[refugees]], redefining "refugee" according to [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|United Nations]] norms. A target for refugees was set at 50,000 and the worldwide ceiling for immigrants was reduced to 270,000 annually.

In 1986, the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Immigration Reform and Control Act]] (IRCA) was passed, creating for the first time penalties for employers who knowingly hired [[Undocumented immigrants (U.S.)|undocumented immigrants]]. IRCA also contained an amnesty for about 3&amp;nbsp;million undocumented immigrants already in the United States, and mandated the intensification of some of the activities of the [[United States Border Patrol]] or INS (now part of [[Department of Homeland Security]]).

===1990s===
The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, led by former Rep. [[Barbara Jordan]], ran from 1990 to 1997. The Commission covered many facets of immigration policy, but started from the perception that the "credibility of immigration policy can be measured by a simple yardstick: people who should get in, do get in; people who should not get in, are kept out; and people who are judged deportable are required to leave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/uscir/becoming/full-report.pdf |title=Becoming an American: Immigration &amp; Immigrant Policy |publisher=U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform |format=PDF |date=September 1997 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, in a series of four reports, the commission looked at all aspects of immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/uscir/reports.html |title=Reports to Congress |publisher=U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first, it found that enforcement was lax and needed improvement on the border and internally. For internal enforcement, it recommended that an automated employment verification system be created to enable employers to distinguish between legal and illegal workers. The second report discussed legal immigration issues and suggested that immediate family members and skilled workers receive priority. The third report covered refugee and asylum issues. Finally, the fourth report reiterated the major points of the previous reports and the need for a new immigration policy. Few of these suggestions were implemented.

The [[Immigration Act of 1990]] (IMMACT) modified and expanded the 1965 act; it significantly increased the total immigration limit to 700,000 and increased visas by 40 percent. Family reunification was retained as the main immigration criterion, with significant increases in employment-related immigration.

Several pieces of legislation signed into law in 1996 marked a turn towards harsher policies for both legal and illegal immigrants. The [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996|Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act]] (AEDPA) and [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act]] (IIRIRA) vastly increased the categories of criminal activity for which immigrants, including [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] holders, can be deported and imposed [[mandatory detention]] for certain types of deportation cases. As a result, well over 2&amp;nbsp;million individuals have been deported since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21595892-barack-obama-has-presided-over-one-largest-peacetime-outflows-people-americas |title=The Great Expulsion |work=Economist |date=February 8, 2013 |accessdate=2014-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
The [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001]] affected American perspectives on many issues, including immigration. A total of 20 foreign terrorists were involved, 19 of whom took part in the attacks that caused the deaths of 2,977 victims, most of them [[civilian]]s. The terrorists had entered the United States on tourist or student visas. Four of them, however, had violated the terms of their visas. The attack exposed long-standing weaknesses in the U.S. immigration system that included failures in the areas of visa processing, internal enforcement, and information sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kephart |first=Janice |url=http://www.cis.org/articles/2005/kephart.html |title=Moving Beyond the 9/11 Staff Report on Terrorist Travel |publisher=Center for Immigration Studies |date=September 2005 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[REAL ID Act]] of 2005 changed some visa limits, tightened restrictions on asylum applications and made it easier to exclude suspected terrorists, and removed restrictions on building border fences.

In 2005, Senators [[John McCain]] and [[Ted Kennedy]] revived the discussion of comprehensive immigration reform with the proposal of the [[Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act]], incorporating legalization, guest worker programs, and enhanced border security.  The bill was never voted on in the Senate, but portions are incorporated in later Senate proposals.

In 2006, the House of Representatives and the Senate produced their own, conflicting bills. In December 2005, the House passed the [[Border Protection, Anti-terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005]], which was sponsored by Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-WI). The act was limited to enforcement and focused on both the border and the interior. In the Senate, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (CIRA) was sponsored by Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA) and passed in May 2006. CIRA would have given a path to eventual citizenship to a majority of undocumented immigrants already in the country as well as dramatically increased legal immigration. Although the bills passed their respective chambers, no compromise bill emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=North |first=David |url=http://cis.org/ImmigrationHistory |title=Immigration History |publisher=Center for Immigration Studies |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]] was discussed in the Senate, which would have given a path to eventual citizenship to a large majority of illegal entrants in the country, significantly increased legal immigration and increased enforcement. The bill failed to pass a cloture vote, essentially killing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nicole |last=Gaouette |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/29/nation/na-immig29 |title=Senate buries immigration bill |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 29, 2007 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual components of various reform packages have been separately introduced and pursued in the Congress. [[The Dream Act|The DREAM Act]] is a bill initially introduced in 2001, incorporated in the various comprehensive reform bills, and then separately reintroduced in 2009 and 2010.  The bill would provide legal residency and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who graduate from U.S. high schools and attend college or join the military.

Immigrant visa limits set by Congress remain at 700,000 for the combined categories of employment, family preference, and family immediate. There are additional provisions for diversity and a small number of special visas.  In 2008 immigration in these categories totaled slightly less than 750,000 and similar totals (representing maximums allowed by Congress) have been tallied in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/how-united-states-immigration-system-works-fact-sheet |title=How the United States Immigration System Works |publisher=Immigration Policy Center|date=March 1, 2014 |accessdate=2014-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalization numbers have ranged from about 500,000 to just over 1,000,000 per year since the early 1990s, with peak years in 1996 and 2008 each around 1,040,000.  These numbers add up to more than the number of visas issued in those years because as many as 2.7 million of those who were granted amnesty by IRCA in 1986 have converted or will convert to citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=James |last=Lee |first2=Nancy |last2=Rytina |url=https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/natz_fr_2008.pdf |title=Naturalizations in the United States: 2008 |publisher=Department of Homeland Security Office of Immigration Statistics |date=March 2009 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, immigrants become eligible for citizenship after five years of residence. Many do not immediately apply, or do not pass the test on the first attempt.  This means that the counts for visas and the counts for naturalization will always remain out of step, though in the long run the naturalizations add up to somewhat less than the visas.

These numbers are separate from [[illegal immigration]], which peaked at probably over 1 million per year around the year 2000 and has probably declined to about 500,000 per year by 2009, which seems comparable or perhaps less than the outflow returning to their native countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/94.pdf |title=Trends in Unauthorized Immigration: Undocumented Inflow Now Trails Legal Inflow |publisher=Pew Hispanic Center |date=October 2, 2008 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the legal immigrant categories may include former illegal immigrants who have come current on legal applications and passed background checks; these individuals are included in the count of legal visas, not as a separate or additional number.

For Mexico and the Philippines, the only categories of immigrant visa available in practice are those for immediate dependent family of U.S. citizens. Persons who applied since 1994 have not been in the categories for adult children and siblings, and trends show that these data are unlikely to change. In fact, the trend has recently been moving in the opposite direction. Immigrant work visas run about 6 to 8 years behind current.{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  While the government does not publish data on the number of pending applications, the evidence is that the backlog in those categories dwarfs the yearly quotas.

Legal immigration visas should not be confused with temporary work permits. Permits for seasonal labor (about 285,000 in 2008) or students (about 917,000 in 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Randall |last=Monger |first2=Macreadie |last2=Barr |url=https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/ois_ni_fr_2008.pdf |title=Nonimmigrant Admissions to the United States: 2008 |publisher=Department of Homeland Security Office of Immigration Statistics |date=April 2009 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally do not permit conversion to immigrant status.  Even those who are legally authorized to work temporarily in the United States (such as H1-B workers) must apply for permanent residence separately, and gain no advantage from their temporary employment authorization. This is unlike many other countries, whose laws provide for permanent residence after a certain number of years of legal employment. Temporary workers, therefore, do not form a distinctly counted source of immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=13ad2f8b69583210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=13ad2f8b69583210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD |title=Temporary (Nonimmigrant) Workers |publisher=U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services |date=2009-12-20 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S.744)]]===
On April 17, 2013, the so-called [[Gang of Eight (immigration)|"Gang of Eight"]] in the United States Senate introduced S.744, the long-awaited Senate version of the immigration reform bill proposed in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:SN00744:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; |title=Bill text.

[http://www.schumer.senate.gov/forms/immigration.pdf Text of the proposed legislation] was promptly released on the website of Senator Charles Schumer. On June 27, 2013, the Senate passed the bill on 68-32 margin. The bill has not been taken up by the United States House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Immigration Reform Issues since 2013|url=http://www.business-of-migration.com/migration-today/us-immigration-reform-issues-since-2013/|publisher=Migration as a travel business|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive actions===
On November 21, 2014, president [[Barack Obama]] signed two [[Immigration reform#Obama's executive actions of November 2014|executive actions]] which had the effect of delaying deportation for millions of illegal immigrants. The orders apply to parents of United States citizens and young people brought into the country illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/21/obama-signs-executive-action-delaying-deportations-for-millions-illegal/ | title=Obama signs executive action delaying deportations for millions of illegal immigrants | work=Fox News | date=21 November 2014 | accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Convention concerning Hours of Work on Board Ship and Manning''' or '''Hours of Work and Manning (Sea) Convention, 1936''' is  an [[International Labour Organization]] [[International Labour Organization#International Labour Conference|Convention]] which never entered into force. It was established in 1936, and closed for ratification on 24 February 2002, when the 1996 ''Convention concerning Seafarers' Hours of Work and the Manning of Ships'' entered into force.

==Revisions==
The convention was revised by the [[Wages, Hours of Work and Manning (Sea) Convention, 1946|Convention concerning Wages, Hours of Work on Board Ship and Manning]] of 1946 as well as its [[Wages, Hours of Work and Manning (Sea) Convention (Revised), 1949|1949 ]] and [[Wages, Hours of Work and Manning (Sea) Convention (Revised), 1958|1958]] revision, none of which entered into force. The entry into force of the 1996 Convention concerning Seafarers' Hours of Work and the Manning of Ships (which also revised the convention) in 2002 signified the end of the opening for signature of the convention. 

== Ratifications==
The convention was ratified by three countries, but automatically denounced by two upon entry into force of the 1996 Convention for those countries. The convention is not legally binding upon any state.

It is an autonomous organization under [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]], [[Government of India]], and is governed by a Board with the [[Governor of Bihar]] as its ''ex officio'' Chairman, and is known for its rare collection of [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]] [[manuscripts]]. It also hosts [[paintings]] made during the [[Rajput]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] eras of [[India]].

It is also a designated 'Manuscript Conservation Centre' (MCC) under the [[National Mission for Manuscripts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namami.org/convervation.htm Manuscript Conservation Centres] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506234603/http://www.namami.org/convervation.htm |date=6 May 2012 }} ''[[National Mission for Manuscripts]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Maulvi Khuda Bakhsh.jpg|thumb|Maulvi Khuda Bakhsh]]
The library finds its origin in private collection of a bibliophile Mohammad Bakhsh and expanded by his son Khuda Bakhsh, who inherited 1,400 manuscripts and continued to add to the collection and eventually converted it into a private library by 1880. The library was opened to public upon its inauguration by Sir [[Charles Alfred Elliott]], [[Governor of Bengal]] on 5 October 1891. After partition in 1947, Dr. [[S.V. Sohoni]] played a key role in ensuring that the collections were retained in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Godbole|first1=Sanjay|title=Nirapekśa Samśodhaka (निरपेक्ष संशोधक)|publisher=''Lokasatta'' (''लोकसत्ता'') (Mumbai), Lokaraṅga supplement (लोकरंग पुरवणी)|date=31 March 2002|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 through a [[List of Indian federal legislation#1951.E2.80.931975|Federal Legislation]], an Act of Parliament, namely 'Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library Act' (1969), the [[Government of India]] declared Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library a centre of national importance and government took over the funding, maintenance and development of the library. Today it continues to attract scholars from all over the world.&lt;ref name="ot"/&gt;

Past directors of the library have been Dr. Abid Reza Bedar, who after remaining with the [[Raza Library]], came as Director to the institution in 1972, and did some important work towards reviving the library along with his successor Habibur Rehman Chighani, at present the Director of  the library is the Dr. Imtiaz Ahmad, since February, 2004. It is on its way to become the country's first library to computerize its hand written collection for universal dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pride of Patna|url=http://kblibrary.bih.nic.in/}}&lt;/ref&gt;, after Retirement Dr. Imtiaz Ahmad Library Ran under without Director.

'''''The Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States''''', 136 U.S. 1 (1890), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case that upheld the [[Edmunds–Tucker Act]] on May 19, 1890. Among other things, the act disincorporated [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).

The LDS Church was represented by its chief counsel [[Franklin S. Richards]] and former congressman [[James Broadhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rothera|first1=Evan|title=The Tenacious "Twin Relic": Republicans, Polygamy, and The Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v.

==Decision==
The ruling in ''Late Corporation'' would have directed federal [[escheat]] of substantially all the property of the legally disincorporated LDS Church, which was estimated at $3 million. Following the decision, the [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] for [[Utah Territory]] reported seizing only $381,812 in assets.&lt;ref&gt;Paul G. Kauper &amp; Stephen C. Ellis, "Religious Corporations and the Law," 71 Mich. L. Rev. (1972-1973), 1499, 1517.  This figure includes seized stock and cash in bank accounts as well as $10,000 "credits due on sheep."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Real property]], including [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temples]], was never seized, although the ruling authorized it.  Within five months, the LDS Church officially discontinued the practice of plural marriage with the [[1890 Manifesto]]. On October 25, 1893, a congressional resolution authorized the release of assets seized from the LDS Church because, "said church has discontinued the practice of polygamy and no longer encourages or gives countenance to any manner of practices in violation of law, or contrary to good morals or public policy."&lt;ref&gt;Jt. Res 11., 53d Cong., 1st Sess., 28 Stat. 980&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melville Fuller|Chief Justice Fuller]]'s dissent asserted that though Congress has the power to criminalize [[polygamy]], "it is not authorized under the cover of that power to seize and confiscate the property of persons, individuals, or corporations, without office found, because they may have been guilty of criminal practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|136|67|1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ligado Networks''' is an American satellite communications company developing a [[Communications satellite|satellite-terrestrial]] network to support [[5G]] and [[Internet of Things]] applications in North America. The [[Reston, Virginia]]-based company has 40&amp;nbsp;MHz of spectrum licenses in the nationwide block of 1500&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1700&amp;nbsp;MHz spectrum in the [[L-Band]]. It operates the SkyTerra 1 satellite.

The company was formerly known as LightSquared, which sought to develop a wholesale [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] [[wireless broadband]] communications network integrated with [[satellite]] coverage across the [[United States]]. Concerns over interference ultimately prevented LightSquared from deploying its planned network. After restructuring, emerging from bankruptcy and modifying its network plan, the new company, Ligado Networks, launched in 2016.

==Network and spectrum==
As of 2016, Ligado Networks seeks FCC permission for terrestrial deployment of its mid-band spectrum in the 1500&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1700&amp;nbsp;MHz range.&lt;ref name="Goovaerts16"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis16&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/4933 |title=FCC Opens GPS-Adjacent Ligado Proposal for Comment |author=Dee Ann Divis |date=1 May 2016 |publisher=Inside GNSS |accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company plans to make its spectrum available to industry and government to serve emerging [[Internet of Things]] and 5G technologies.&lt;ref name=Goovaerts16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibbs16/&gt; The plans have received favorable reviews from organizations including the Competitive Carriers Association, [[CTIA – The Wireless Association|CTIA — The Wireless Association]], Public Knowledge and [[Open Technology Institute|Open Technology Institute at New America]], among others.&lt;ref name=CommunicationsDaily16&gt;{{cite news |title=Ligado's proposed LTE plans sees calls for more changes |newspaper=Communications Daily |date=25 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macri16&gt;{{cite news |title=Net neutrality rivals join forces to push FCC on 5G spectrum sharing |last1=Macri |first1=Giuseppe |url=http://www.insidesources.com/net-neutrality-opponents-join-forces-to-push-fcc-on-5g-spectrum-sharing/ |newspaper=Inside Sources |date=21 August 2016 |accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the company (as LightSquared) acquired licenses to mid-band spectrum when it bought SkyTerra Communications.&lt;ref name=Effinger10&gt;{{cite news |title=A Harbinger of wireless risks to come |last1=Effinger |first1=Anthony |last2=Burton |first2=Katherine |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/23/AR2010102303110.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=23 October 2010 |accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; LightSquared's plans, which did not come to fruition, were to use the spectrum to create a 4G wireless mobile network covering North America.&lt;ref name=Reardon13&gt;{{cite news |title=Finally, some good news for LightSquared and its 4G hopes |last1=Reardon |first1=Marguerite |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/finally-some-good-news-for-lightsquared-and-its-4g-hopes/ |newspaper=[[CNET]] |date=3 May 2013 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dillow10&gt;{{cite news |title=The largest commercial antenna ever put into space will beam 4G where towers won't |last1=Dillow |first1=Clay |url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-11/largest-communication-antenna-ever-put-space-will-brings-4g-where-towers-wont |newspaper=[[Popular science]] |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile Satellite Ventures changed its name to [[SkyTerra|SkyTerra Communications]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=FCC08&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/6520193285.pdf |title=Mobile Satellite Ventures Subsidiary LLC Notification of Name Change |date=9 December 2008 |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; LightSquared emerged from SkyTerra after [[Philip Falcone]]'s [[Harbinger Capital Partners]] acquired SkyTerra in March 2010.&lt;ref name="Effinger10"/&gt; The company received about $2.9 billion in assets from Harbinger and affiliates, as well as more than $2.3 billion in debt and equity financing.&lt;ref name=Carew11&gt;{{cite news |title=Update 2-Falcone's LightSquared raises $265 mln in funding |last1=Carew |first1=Sinead |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lightsquared-funding-idUSN1E76406420110705 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=5 July 2011 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shields14&gt;{{cite news |title=Falcone leaves LightSquared board amin bankruptcy talks |last1=Shields |first1=Todd |last2=Kary |first2=Tiffany |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-18/investor-philip-falcone-resigns-from-lightsquared-board |newspaper=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=19 June 2014 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; LightSquared sought to develop a [[4G LTE]] [[wireless broadband]] network&lt;ref name="Reardon13"/&gt; using spectrum in the [[L-Band]].&lt;ref name=Gibbs16/&gt; The company's proposed nationwide network would then sell its services wholesale to other service providers, not to retail customers.&lt;ref name=Reardon11&gt;{{cite news |title=LightSquare: The answer to U.S. wireless competition? |last1=Reardon |first1=Marguerite |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/lightsquared-the-answer-to-u-s-wireless-competition/ |newspaper=[[CNET]] |date=21 April 2011 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company launched its SkyTerra 1 satellite from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]] on November 14, 2010.&lt;ref name=Amos10&gt;{{cite news |title=Huge antenna launched into space |last1=Amos |first1=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-11756327 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its launch, the satellite contained the largest commercial reflector antenna put into service.&lt;ref name=Amos10/&gt; SkyTerra 1 replaced MSAT-1 and MSAT-2 as most of the data from the company's MSAT satellites relocated to SkyTerra 1.&lt;ref name=CommunicationsDaily10&gt;{{cite news |title=Satellites |newspaper=Communications Daily |date=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LightSquared proposals===
On March 1, 2001, Ligado Networks' predecessor, Mobile Satellite Ventures applied to the FCC to use a "combination of [[Spot beam|spot-beam]] satellites and terrestrial base stations."&lt;ref name=FCC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=200647&amp;f_number=SATASG2001030200017|title=FCC Docket File Number: SATASG2001030200017, "Mobile Satellite Ventures LLC Application for Assignment and Modification of Licenses and for Authority to Launch and Operate a Next-Generation Mobile Satellite System"| page = 9 |work=FCC.gov |date=March 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2011, The Federal Communications Commission granted a conditional waiver that allowed LightSquared and its wholesale customers to offer terrestrial-only devices rather than having to incorporate both satellite and terrestrial services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fiercebroadbandwireless.com/story/fccs-genachowski-we-wont-let-lightsquared-operate-without-gps-interference-/2011-06-06 |title=FCC's Genachowski: We won't let LightSquared operate without GPS interference resolution |work=FierceBroadbandWireless |date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-11-133A1.pdf  |title=FCC Order, Granted LightSquared Subsidiary LLC, a Mobile Satellite Service licensee in the L-Band, a conditional waiver of the Ancillary Terrestrial Component "integrated service" rule  |date=26 January 2011 |work=Federal Communications Commission |publisher=FCC.Gov |accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waiver was conditioned on resolving concerns about interference to GPS.&lt;ref name=FCC20120214&gt;FCC press release "[http://www.fcc.gov/document/spokesperson-statement-ntia-letter-lightsquared-and-gps" Spokesperson Statement on NTIA Letter--LightSquared and GPS ]" February 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=LightSquared Interference Issues |newspaper=Communications Daily |date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies that provide global positioning systems, in addition to the United States Air Force, the operator of the [[GPS#Possible threat|GPS]] system, opposed the FCC waiver, saying that more time was needed to resolve concerns that LightSquared's service might interfere with their satellite-based offerings. LightSquared promised to work with GPS providers and give the FCC monthly updates on a resolution to interference concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FCC grants LightSquared approval to use satellite airwaves for cell phones |author=Cecilia Kang |newspaper=Washington Post |date=26 January 2011 |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2011/01/the_federal_communications_com_9.html?wprss=posttech |accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, LightSquared threatened to sue the FCC if its network is not approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flyingmag.com/news/lightsquared-threatens-legal-action-against-fcc|title=LightSquared Threatens Legal Action against FCC |date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2012, the FCC initiated proceedings to vacate LightSquared's Conditional Waiver Order based on the NTIA's conclusion that there was currently no practical way to mitigate potential GPS interference.&lt;ref name=FCC20120214/&gt;

===Interference issues===
LightSquared's plan for standalone-terrestrial broadband services met resistance over potential interference issues with GPS systems.
In a January 12, 2011, letter to the FCC, [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] (NTIA) chief Lawrence Strickling said that LightSquared's hybrid mobile broadband services raise "significant interference concerns" and that several federal agencies wanted the FCC to defer action on LightSquared until the concerns were addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/download.do?attachment_key=860737 |title=NTIA letter to FCC |date=January 12, 2011 |work=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 2011, GPS industry representatives sent a letter to the FCC, sharing a study by Garmin International that said "widespread, severe GPS jamming will occur" if LightSquared's plans were approved.&lt;ref name=Baruch11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/signal-processing/lightsquared-jamming-report-11030 |title=Notice of Ex Parte presentation in LightSquared Subsidiary LLC application for modification of authority for ancillary terrestrial component, File No. SAT-MOD-20101118-00239 |date=20 January 2011 |publisher=GPS World |accessdate=28 December 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209074513/http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/signal-processing/lightsquared-jamming-report-11030 |archivedate= 9 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study used two GPS models and simulated LightSquared transmitters.&lt;ref name=Baruch11/&gt;

Testing showed that LightSquared's proposed ground-based transmissions could "overpower" the fainter GPS signals from space-based satellites. With the band close to those GPS signals, "GPS devices could pick up the stronger LightSquared signals and become overloaded or saturated".&lt;ref name=GPSgov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gps.gov/spectrum/lightsquared/ |title=LightSquared and GPS |publisher=GPS.gov |accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 2011, former Deputy Secretary of Defense [[William J. Lynn III|Bill Lynn]], along with the head of the [[USAF Space Command]], Gen. [[William L. Shelton]], expressed concerns about potential GPS interference from the LightSquared network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dodbuzz.com/2011/02/17/new-wireless-tech-jams-gps/|title=New Wireless Tech Jams GPS|date=17 February 2011|publisher=DoD Buzz|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 2011, with respect to concerns raised by the U.S. GPS Industry Council and NTIA about LightSquared’s proposed operations, the FCC stated that LightSquared could not commence offering a commercial terrestrial service until the agency concluded that the harmful interference concerns had been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-11-57A1.doc |title=FCC Order, Fixed and Mobile Services in the Mobile Satellite Service Bands at 1525-1559 MHz and 1626.5-1660.5 MHz, 1610-1626.5 MHz and 2483.5-2500 MHz, and 2000-2020 MHz and 2180-2200 MHz |date=April 5, 2011 |publisher=FCC.Gov | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges in Congress===
On September 15, 2011, Representative [[Mike Turner|Michael Turner]] (R-Ohio) called for the United States House Oversight and Government Committee to investigate LightSquared under the premise that the Federal Communications Commission waived a rule for LightSquared because of campaign contributions to Democrats.&lt;ref name="Werner11"&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Republican lawmakers call for investigation of LightSquared case |last1=Werner |first1=Debra |url=http://spacenews.com/us-republican-lawmakers-call-investigation-lightsquared-case/ |newspaper=Spacenews |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Krigman11&gt;{{cite news |title=LightSquared execs fire back |last1=Krigman |first1=Eliza |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2011/09/lightsquared-execs-fire-back-063728 |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date= |accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; LightSquared officials, who had contributed to both Republicans and Democrats, denied the allegations.&lt;ref name=Werner11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krigman11/&gt;

The '''Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration''', signed on 31 October 1958, ensures that in member countries, appellations of origin receive protection when are protected in their country of origin. It lays down provisions for what qualifies as an appellation of origin, protection measures and establishes an [[International Register of Appellations of Origin]], run by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]]. The agreement came into force in 1966, and was revised at Stockholm (1967) and amended in 1979. As of May 2015, 28 states are party to the convention and 1000 appellations of origin has been registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Lisbon Agreement|url=http://www.wipo.int/lisbon/en/general/|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreements establishes a Special Union under Article 19 of the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] (1883).&lt;ref name="WIPO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/lisbon/en/legal_texts/lisbon_agreement.html|title=Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration]|work=[[WIPO]]|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some aspects of the agreement have been superseded by the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]].

==2015 Act==
In May 2015, the Geneva Act to the Agreement was adopted, formally extending protection to [[Geographical Indication]] and changing the name: ''Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement on Appellations of Origin and Geographical Indications''. The act furthermore allows intergovernmental organisations to be become parties. On 21 May the Act was signed by 13 states: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Congo, France, Gabon, Hungary, Mali, Nicaragua, Peru, Romania and Togo.
==Parties==
The treaty applies mutually between the parties of the 1958 Lisbon Agreement and the 1967 Stockholm Act, but not between a party solely to the 1958 Agreement and another party solely to the 1967 Stockholm act. The Geneva Act is not in force, but after it enters into force, it will only apply between the Geneva act parties. 
If a state is a party to multiple Lisbon instruments, then a registered appellation of origin registered under any of the instruments applies also to parties of the other instruments the state is a party to.

The '''Louisiana Code of Evidence'''&lt;ref&gt;The citation of this Code by this title is authorised by [http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=72442 article 1102] of this Code.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[legal code|code]] of [[Evidence (law)|evidence law]], enacted by section 1 of Act 515 of 1988, under [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]] [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Law]]. The Code became effective on 1 January 1989,&lt;ref&gt;Act 515 of 1988, section 12(3). [http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=72441 Digitised copy].&lt;/ref&gt; and governs proceedings in the [[judiciary of Louisiana|courts of Louisiana]] to the extent and with the exceptions stated in Article 1101 of the Code.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Code of Evidence, [http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=72436 article 101]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill for Act 515 of 1988 was Senate Bill 155, introduced by Senator [[Ben Bagert]].

Laws for a code of evidence was introduced in 1818, 1956, 1986, and 1987. After nearly two centuries of failed attempts to codify Louisiana's evidence law, the [[Louisiana State Legislature]] enacted an Evidence Code in 1988.

== History ==
{{Further|Edward Livingston#Livingston Code}}
The evidentiary reform movement began in Britain in the early nineteenth century under the leadership of [[Jeremy Bentham]]. "Within a short time of the publication of Bentham's ‘Theory of Judicial Evidence’ in 1818, Louisiana's [[Edward Livingston]],&lt;ref name=p689&gt;Force, Pugh, Rault and Triche, "Louisiana Code of Evidence - A Retrospective and Prospective View" (1989) 49 [[Louisiana Law Review|La. L. Rev.]] 689&lt;/ref&gt; considered "America's Bentham", by [[John Henry Wigmore|Wigmore]],&lt;ref name="Livingston considered America's [[Jeremy Bentham]]"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTxrbmJTNAUC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=America%27s+Bentham,+as+he+was+characterized+by+Wigmore&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0GHeJkBWVM&amp;sig=CQJaQcoF9udh0W8AjY-xOlN3-lk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1EK_VPh6xKE2iKmAuAU&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=America's%20Bentham%2C%20as%20he%20was%20characterized%20by%20Wigmore&amp;f=false | title=LSU Law: The Louisiana State University Law School from 1906 to 1977 | publisher=Louisiana State University Press | work=Law school history | date=2004 | accessdate=January 21, 2015 | author=Hargrave, W. Lee | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; prepared and proposed to the Louisiana Legislature a Code of Evidence for this state, designed to govern proceedings in both civil and criminal cases. Had it been adopted, the development of evidence law in the United States might well have been very different. However, the Livingston Evidence Code was not enacted.&lt;ref name="Livingston Code"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2103&amp;context=jclc | title=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology: Livingston Code, The | publisher=Northwestern University School of Law Scholarly Commons | date=1928 | accessdate=December 29, 2014 | author=Moore, Elon H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the twentieth century, Louisiana evidence law had become notoriously murky and uncertain. This confusion led to a second attempt at codification in 1956. After some ten years of effort, the Louisiana Law Institute abandoned the project, in part because the contending forces simply could not agree.&lt;ref name="murky and uncertain law"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5169&amp;context=lalrev | title=An Overview of the New Louisiana Code of Evidence - Its Imperfections and Uncertainties | publisher=Louisiana Law Review | work=Legal | date=January 1989 | accessdate=January 20, 2015 | author=Rault Jr., Gerard A. | pages=698, volume 49, number 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current law ==
In 1979 the quest for an evidence code was renewed by [[Ben Bagert]], a state legislator who was also a lawyer with an active litigation practice. By then, a Federal Code of Evidence had been adopted and Bagert had experienced, first hand, how justice was better served when the court and the litigants had a rule book to guide them. Because Bagert believed that these benefits were achievable in state court proceedings, he persuaded the Legislature to direct that a code of evidence be drafted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louisiana House of Representatives Concurrent Resolution|La. H.R. Con. Res.]] 250, Reg. Sess. (1979) by Representative Ben Bagert&lt;/ref&gt; Following this directive, the Louisiana Law Institute again accepted the challenge of compiling a code and a proposal was published and submitted to the legislature in 1986. As with the Livingston Code and the 1956 attempt by the Law Institute, the Proposed Code proved controversial. What the plaintiff bar liked, the defense bar disliked. What prosecutors abhorred, criminal defense lawyers applauded. The Proposed Code did not come out of committee in the 1986 legislature. In the 1987 session, another stalemate&lt;ref&gt;Senate Bill by Senator Bagert was rejected.&lt;/ref&gt; blocked the adoption of Bagert’s bill proposing an Evidence Code.

Observers of the legislature were predicting a similar fate for the Proposed Code in the 1988 legislative session; however, as lead author of the bill, Bagert had been conducting frequent meetings with the competing forces who had doomed the codes of prior years. On the night before his bill was to be considered by Senate Committee, Senator Bagert, sensing that a compromise was achievable, convened a meeting of opposing factions in the Senate basement. In attendance besides Senator Bagert were Kerry Triche, of the Louisiana Law Institute; Jack Martzell, of the Louisiana Trial Lawyers Association; John Mamoulides and Bernie Boudreaux, [[district attorney]]s representing the District Attorneys Association; and Robert Glass, Frank Desalvo, James E. Boren, and John Reed, eminent criminal defense lawyers. Just before midnight a compromise was achieved and additional amendments were drafted for consideration by the committee when morning arrived.

On the ensuing day, legislative observers were stunned to see that the competing adversaries had agreed to the enactment of an evidence code as amended. After the compromise, Senator Bagert’s bill was enacted by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Buddy Roemer.

'''Metalaw''' is  “the entire sum of legal rules regulating relationships between different races in the universe.” &lt;ref&gt;http://metalawandseti.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a concept of [[space law]] closely related to the scientific [[Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence]] ([[SETI]]).&lt;ref&gt;Adam Chase Korbitz, The Limits of Metalaw and the Need for Further Elaboration, Paper [http://www.iafastro.net/iac/browse.lite/IAC-10/A4/2/ IAC-10-A4.2.10], presented at the 39th Symposium on the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, 61st International Astronautical Congress, 2010, Prague, Czech Republic&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea is an elaboration of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[Categorical imperative]] "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a '''universal law'''."

'''

== Andrew Haley and the Origin of Metalaw ==
'''

First articulated by attorney [[Andrew G. Haley]] in 1956, Metalaw was the term Haley coined to refer to his hypothesis regarding the proposed existence of fundamental legal precepts of theoretically universal application to all intelligences, both human and hypothesized intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]]. Writer Frank G. Anderson proposed that the definition be expanded to cover all intelligent species,extraterrestrial and terrestrial - which would include any/all intelligent animal life.

In 1956, Haley first published an article entitled “Space Law and Metalaw – A Synoptic View,”&lt;ref&gt;Andrew G. Haley, Space law and Metalaw – A Synoptic View, Harvard Law Record 23 (November 8, 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; in which Haley first proposed what he called an “Interstellar [[Golden Rule]]”:  Do unto others as they would have you do unto them.   According to Haley, humans can project only one principle of human law onto our possible future relations with extraterrestrial intelligence: “the stark concept of absolute equity.”  Haley developed his formulation of Metalaw somewhat further in various papers and a 1963 book.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew G. Haley, Space Law and Government, Appleton Century Crofts, New York, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

'''

== Elaboration by Ernst Fasan ==
'''

Significant elaboration of Haley's ideas did not take place until the publication in 1970 of ''Relations with Alien Intelligences:  The Scientific Basis of Metalaw'',&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Fasan, Relations with Alien Intelligences:  The Scientific Basis of Metalaw, Berlin Verlag, Berlin, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; written by Dr. [[Ernst Fasan]].

In ''Relations with Alien Intelligences'', Fasan proposed Metalaw is “the entire sum of legal rules regulating relationships between different races in the universe.” Metalaw is the “first and basic ‘law’ between races” providing the “ground rules” for a relationship if and when humans establish communication with or encounter an intelligent extraterrestrial race elsewhere in the universe. Fasan asserted that these rules would govern both human conduct and that of extraterrestrial races so as to avoid mutually harmful activities.

In later papers&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Fasan, Discovery of ETI:  Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Legal Implications, Acta Astronautica 21 (2) (1990) 131-135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Fasan, Legal Consequences of a SETI Detection, Acta Astronautica 42 (10-12) (1998) 677-679&lt;/ref&gt; published in the 1990s that more directly related Metalaw to SETI, Fasan proposed a simple 3-prong formula of metalegal principles. That formula involves:

# A prohibition on damaging the other race.
# The right of a race to self-defense.
# The right to adequate living space.

'''

== Criticism of Metalaw ==
'''

Several authors have criticized the metalegal principles proposed by Haley and Fasan for their reliance on Immanuel Kant’s [[Categorical Imperative]] and on an approach to [[legal science]] and [[jurisprudence]] known as [[natural law]] theory. In jurisprudence, natural law theory refers generally to the view that links law to morality and proposes that just laws are immanent in nature and independent of the lawgiver, waiting to be discovered or found (as opposed to created by humans), usually by means of reason alone.&lt;ref&gt;G.S. Robinson, Ecological foundations of Haley‟s Metalaw, Journal of the British Interplanetary Society 22 (1969) 266-274&lt;/ref&gt;

Other commentators have noted that Haley’s formulation of Metalaw depends heavily upon subjective or relative (and therefore inadequate) concepts of “good” and “bad.”&lt;ref&gt;F. Lyall, P.B. Larsen, Space Law: A Treatise, Ashgate Publishing Company, Burlington VT, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics have noted that there is no guarantee that other civilizations would abide by Haley’s assertions regarding equity among intelligent races in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;G.H. Reynolds, International space law: Into the Twenty-First Century, Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 25 (1992) 225-255&lt;/ref&gt;  Haley’s failure to acknowledge the obvious anthropocentric limits of natural law theory has led some to note that the cultural concept of rules or law is itself anthropocentric.&lt;ref&gt;G.S. Robinson, note 7, supra&lt;/ref&gt;

'''

== Metalaw in popular culture ==

In ''[[Have Space Suit - Will Travel|Have Space Suit -- Will Travel]]'', a 1958 story by science fiction author [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and published two years after Haley's 1956 paper, one of the characters mentions “space law and meta-law."

[[G. Harry Stine]] (under his pen-name Lee Correy) wrote a short novel on the topic - "A Matter of Metalaw" ([[DAW_Books]], October 1986).

'''Military divorce''' is a specific type of [[divorce]] that arises when one or both partners are members of the military. Although typically an uncontested divorce, military divorces are different because they require additional requirements to be fulfilled. Divorces occur less frequently than within the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/01/23/military-divorce-rate-down-slightly-in-2012.html?comp=7000023317843&amp;rank=2|title=Military Divorce Rate Down Slightly in 2012|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They present a special set of challenges that make military divorces more complicated than a typical divorce. For example, [http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/sscra/a/scra2.htm The Federal Service Members Civil Relief Act of 2003] requires any person seeking a divorce to state that their spouse is or is not currently a member of the United States armed forces. This is meant to prevent spouses from seeking divorces from service members who would be unable to attend divorce proceedings.

A common challenge presented by military divorce is jurisdiction - where the divorce should be filed if the service member isn't at home. A divorce may be filed at home or where the military member is stationed, both in the United States or abroad.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Calculating military income==
{{expand section|date=June 2013}}
Calculating the income of a member of the military requires specific knowledge and expertise, as service members are paid in a number of ways, including basic allowances for housing, expenses, and their basic pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nclamp.gov/l_setting_child_support.asp|title=SETTING CHILD SUPPORT - The Legal Eagle - North Carolina State Bar - Legal Assistance for Military Personnel|website=www.nclamp.gov|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=this says almost nothing of value. Like saying under "climate", "the weather can be anything. We never know!"  :) |date=June 2013}}

==Division of military retirement as an asset upon divorce==
{{main|Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act}}
A servicemember who has served 20 years is entitled to receive a military retirement. Per the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/1408|title=10 U.S. Code § 1408 - Payment of retired or retainer pay in compliance with court orders|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; State courts may but are not required to divide a servicemember’s “disposable retired pay” upon dissolution, according to that court's domestic relations laws.

Jurisdiction over a service member is a prerequisite for dividing a military retirement. This jurisdiction is more than simply personal jurisdiction through service of process – it requires either residence within the state not due to military orders, domicile in the state, or the service member’s consent.&lt;ref&gt;10 U.S. Code §1408(c)(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

“Disposable retired pay” is defined as the gross retired pay minus (A) payments back to the United States for prior military retirement overpayments and for recoupments required by law resulting from entitlement to retired pay, (B) [[Court martial|court-martial]] forfeitures, (C) pay waived to receive disability payments from the [[Veterans Administration]] (VA), and (D) the Survivor Benefit Plan premium costs for a spouse or former spouse paid pursuant to court order.&lt;ref&gt;10 U.S. Code §1408(a)(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

"While the Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act does not specify a minimum duration of marriage in order to divide retirement, former spouses who wish to receive their share of the retirement directly from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service must have at least 10 years of marriage overlapping the military service.&lt;ref&gt;10 U.S. Code §1408(d)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation contains a section entitled “Former Spouse Payments from Retired Pay” which sets forth all of the requirements to receive direct payment from DFAS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black &amp; Graham, LLC Military Divorce Guide re: VA Disability/Indemnity for VA Waiver: http://www.military-divorce-guide.com/va-disability-divorce/indemnity-va-waiver.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;DFAS: {{cite web|url=http://comptroller.defense.gov/fmr/current/07b/07b_29.pdf |accessdate=June 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620164044/http://comptroller.defense.gov/fmr/current/07b/07b_29.pdf |archivedate=June 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If retirement pay is determined to be at least partially a marital asset, DoD Regulation 7000.14-R Para 290601(C) (backed up by 10 USC 1447-1455) requires that division orders specify a dollar amount of award or a percentage of retirement pay with no offsets or set asides.  The only way to specify the correct percentage when there have been promotions after the divorce is via the DFAS Hypothetical Method or the Dual Coverture Value (DCV) Method &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.increa.com/articles/division-military-coverture-value/|title=Divorce Division of Military Retirement with Area Method|website=www.increa.com|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which is also called the "Area Method" (AM) because of the way it shows on an area diagram). The first involves a sequential process and the second involves a formula based on your circumstance, and handles many more circumstances of life, and correctly handles Reserve military members. All three methods give the same result, and 6 years after they were published, the promotion enhancement set-aside was embodied in Federal law with NDAA 2017 Sec 641&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.increa.com/articles/division-2017NDAA-USFSPA-tutorial|title=2017 NDAA and USFSPA Tutorial - Divorced Military Retirement Asset Division|website=www.increa.com|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. More than 20 attorney guides, whitepapers, and spreadsheet calculation aids are available from 10+ years of research in this area by a PhD analyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.increa.com/articles#legal|title=Brian Mork Public Works|website=www.increa.com|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a military member is promoted after divorce, the promotion enhancement due to retirement would be a non-marital asset as recommended by a Department of Defense report to Congress about the USFSPA law.  Courts have struggled to understand how to implement this.  The result is that many times the military member's promotion enhancements, due to sole effort after the divorce, are divided to the ex-spouse.  The Area Method is a straightforward method to equitably divide retirement pay in this situation for an Active Duty or Reserve retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.increa.com/articles/division-promotion-enhancement/|title=Division of Promotion Enhancements - Divorce Military Retirement|website=www.increa.com|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Reserve military officers, a retention benefit program was implemented providing possible early retirement if certain types of duty is done after January 28, 2008.  This benefit does not cause the amount of retirement checks to increase, but it can cause an increase to the number of retirement checks to be paid prior to age 60.  If a marriage was entirely prior to January 28, 2008, all of the extra checks should equitably belong to the military member, and a division order needs to state this.  If a marriage was entirely after January 28, 2008, all of the extra checks should be divided in the same manner as the payments at age 60 and beyond.  If a marriage spans that date, the extra checks must be divided with a different percentage.  See specific details on a web page about unique Reserve military issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.increa.com/articles/division-reserve-military-retirement/|title=Attorney Guide Dividing Military Reserve Retirement|website=www.increa.com|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of VA disability payments==
A Supreme Court decision prohibits states from dividing VA disability payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/490/581/|title=Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U.S. 581 (1989)|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not preclude a state from ordering indemnity payments from a retiree who waives retired pay to receive VA disability after a decree of dissolution has issued.   In the State of Michigan, an Appellate court has ruled&lt;ref&gt;King v. King, 149 Mich. App. 495; 386 N.W.2d 562; 1986 Mich. App. LEXIS 2490&lt;/ref&gt; that any offset or indemnity is in violation of the Federal intent of preserving value for the military member, and hence offsets or indemnities are not allowed. Quoting three paragraphs from the King decision,

"The substantive question in this case is whether the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act, 10 USC 1401 et seq., and the supremacy clause of the federal constitution, US Const, art VI, [**564] prevent a state court from treating a military disability pension as a distributable marital asset."

“The court concluded that the trial court was precluded from considering the ex-husband's military disability pension as a marital asset and had improperly awarded the ex-wife one-half the value of the ex-husband's military disability pension. The court agreed with the ex-husband that his military pension could not be considered "directly or indirectly" in the distribution of the marital property.”

"[***7] [**565] In McCarty, the Supreme Court clearly held [*500] that a retirement pension could not be distributed as a marital asset. In a footnote, the Court noted that this prohibition is not to be circumvented by an "off-setting award". 453 U.S. 228-229, fn 22. Although McCarty has been overruled by 10 USC 1408, its rationale applies here since 10 USC 1408 does not allow distribution of a disability pension. Thus, we agree with defendant that his military pension may not be considered "directly or indirectly" in the distribution of the marital property. Cf. Kendall v Kendall, 106 Mich App 240, 243-244; 307 NW2d 457 (1981)."

==Tax issues==
Servicemembers have different rules and regulations with regards to taxes that make child support a more complicated process.  Because some military income and deployment benefits are not taxable, a court must decided to levy obligations based on pre-tax income or post-tax income.

== Servicemembers Civil Relief Act ==
The [[Servicemembers Civil Relief Act]] protects military servicemembers from being sued while on duty and up to one year following service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uscg.mil/legal/la/Legal_Assistance_SCRA.asp | title=The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act | publisher=United States Coast Guard | accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://goldmanlaw303.com/military-divorce-explained/ | title=Military Divorce Explained | publisher=Goldman Law | accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.military.com/benefits/military-legal-matters/scra/servicemembers-civil-relief-act-overview.html | title=SCRA: Servicemembers Civil Relief Act Overview | publisher=Military.com | accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may present a challenge for the plaintiff when suing a member of the military for [[child support]] or other financial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stangelawfirm.com/Military-Divorce/Servicemembers-Civil-Relief-Act.shtml | title=Servicemembers Civil Relief Act | publisher=Stange Law Firm PC | accessdate =31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:German military police car (d1).jpg|thumb|right|German military police car [[Mercedes-Benz Vito]]]]

A '''military police vehicle''' is any vehicle used by [[military police]] (MPs).

== United States ==
When forward deployed, United States military police units customarily employ [[HMMWV]]s or [[internal security vehicle]]s called the [[M1117 Armored Security Vehicle]]. However, on larger installations, MPs assigned to on-post law enforcement duties may use military or civilian 4x4 vehicles. When operating at installations in the U.S., military police typically employ [[police car|patrol cars]] similar to local police departments. Special agents of the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Division|U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command]] or other military special investigation branches, may employ unmarked civilian vehicles in the course of their duties within the United States. These would often be the detective's own private car. In combat zones, these agents employ the same tactical vehicles as regular military police units.

== United Kingdom ==
When in the field, members of the [[British Army]]'s [[Royal Military Police]], [[Royal Air Force Police]], and [[Royal Navy Police]] use [[Land Rovers]] with typical police equipment and signs reading "MILITARY POLICE". When in garrison or on-shore, they use regular civilian-type patrol cars, but with appropriate RMP, RAFP or RNP markings. In the United Kingdom these tend to be [[Vauxhall Vectra]]s, Corsas and Astras, [[Škoda Superb]]s, [[Ford Fiesta]]s, [[Opel Vivaro B|Vauxhall Vivaro]] vans, and [[Honda]] motorbikes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukemergency.co.uk/category/police/armed-forces-police/ Armed Forces Police Vehicles], Police Vehicles of the United Kingdom's Armed Forces.&lt;/ref&gt; Special units such as the [[Special Investigation Branch]] may utilize unmarked patrol cars from time to time.

'''Mothers and Fathers Matter''' (MFM) was a campaign group in Ireland which was formed in September 2014 to oppose the [[Children and Family Relationships Act 2015|Children and Family Relationships Bill]]. MFM also opposed the [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/mothers-and-fathers-matter-launches-no-referendum-campaign-1.2179575 Mothers and Fathers launch No Referendum campaign] Irish Times, 18 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Members and spokespeople for MFM included Keith Mills, “lawyer” Evana Kirrane Boyle, Tom Finegan, [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion]] campaigner Kate Bopp, [[ecology|ecologist]] Sam Shepard and [[David Quinn (columnist)|David Quinn]], of the self-styled [[Iona Institute]] pressure group. The group was chaired by economist Ray Kinsella.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mothersandfathersmatter.org/about/ About Us] Mothers and Fathers Matter&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children and Family Relationships Bill==
MFM opposed the enactment of the [[Children and Family Relationships Act 2015|Children and Family Relationships Bill]], which amended family law in Ireland to extend parental rights and responsibilities to non-traditional families, simplified adoption rights for the spouse or civil partner of a biological parent, and for a long-term domestic partner, and also addressed donor-assisted reproduction (sperm donation and egg donation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR14000028|title=Minister Shatter publishes General Scheme of Children and Family Relationships Bill for consultation|date=30 January 2014|work=Press releases|publisher=Department of Justice and Equality|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group believed the legislation could, in some cases, deprive a child of a mother and father, and turned donor eggs into a commodity.

In February 2015, the group demonstrated outside [[Dáil Éireann]] against the Bill,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicireland.net/children-family-relationships-bill/ Children &amp; Family Relationships bill before Cabinet] by Sarah McDonald, 17 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/player/2015/0313/20743625-mothers-and-fathers-matter-protest-against-children-and-family-relationships-bill/ Mothers and Fathers matter protest against the Children and Family Relationship Bill] www.rte.ie, 13 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  which was approved by the Dáil on 12 March 2015 and signed into law on 6 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiokerry.ie/news/children-and-family-relationships-bill-passes-all-stages-in-the-dail/ Children and Family Relationships Bill passes all stages in the Dáil]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.ie/en/the-president/2015-legislation.html 2015 Legislation]&lt;/ref&gt; MFM subsequently said it was planning a legal challenge to the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Week That Was|url=http://www.krank.ie/category/n_ca/week-59/|accessdate=21 April 2015|work=Krank.ie|date=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015 Marriage Equality Referendum==
MFM launched its campaign against the 2015 Marriage Referendum on 18 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/voters-should-recognise-role-of-mothers-and-fathers-in-referendum-672320.html Voters 'should recognise the role of mothers and fathers' in referendum] www.breakingnews.ie&lt;/ref&gt;  At its launch, the group were challenged to produce research to back their claims and promised to publish any research in dispute on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/lise-hand/stats-all-folks-telling-fact-from-fiction-is-the-real-referendum-game-31152451.html|title=Stat's all, folks - telling fact from fiction is the real referendum game|last=Hand|first=Lise|work=Irish Independent|date=18 April 2015|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/mothers-and-fathers-matter-launches-no-referendum-campaign-1.2179575|title=Mothers and Fathers Matter launches No referendum campaign|last=Minihan|first=Mary|work=Irish Times|date=17 April 2015|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They failed to do so, and their claims have since been proven false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keithjy.wix.com/mots#!Mothers-and-Fathers-Matter-The-Truth-Doesnt/c218b/5538ff430cf23d01644653ec|title='Mothers and Fathers Matter' - The Truth Doesn't|last=Young|first=Keith|date=24 April 2015|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/fintan-otoolbox/mothers-and-fathers-matter-the-truth-doesnt|title=Mothers and Fathers Matter, The Truth Doesn't|last=O'Toolbox|first=Fintan|date=1 May 2015|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[UNICEF]] criticised the group for misinterpreting its research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/ireland/article1551752.ece|title=Group accused over same-sex marriage data|last=Monaghan|first=Gabrielle|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=3 May 2015|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday 25 April 2015, MFM hosted a conference in the [[Marino Institute of Education]] with speakers advocating the retention of the current definition of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/no-vote-group-alleges-misleading-of-public-on-child-issues-1.2189504 No-vote group alleges misleading of public on child issues] Irish Times, 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday 1 May 2015, Keith Mills represented MFM on a debate on the referendum on [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ's]] ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/player/ie/show/10414244/|title=The Late Late Show Extras: Marriage Referendum Debate|publisher=RTÉ|date=1 May 2015|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/late-late-marriage-debate-2081115-May2015/|title=This audience member’s reaction was clear … what did everyone else make of the Late Late debate?|work=The Journal|date=2 May 2015|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 2015, Irish historian Professor John A Murphy wrote a letter to [[The Irish Times]] in which he described the constitutional amendment, which permitted same sex marriage and extended constitutional protection to families based on such marriages, as "grotesque nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/marriage-referendum-1.2209712
&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, MFM Advisory Committee member, David Quinn, tweeted "Proposed change to marriage 'grotesque nonsense' ... Great letter by Prof John A Murphy in @IrishTimes today." Mr Quinn was criticised for this tweet by Irish LGBT rights activist [[Panti]], who wrote: "I can think of lots of things that are grotesque. Extending constitutional protection to all families is not one of them... I would call it 'fair', 'reasonable', 'compassionate', 'considerate', 'respectful', or even 'the very least we can do'. But not 'grotesque'."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/05/13/grotesqueries/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2015, MFM spokesperson Evana Boyle gave an interview to ''[[The Washington Post]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;Boyle, a lawyer and a mother of four, said her side is counting on a backlash to a new era in which homosexuality has become “normalized.” When even Catholic schools plan lessons around LGBT Awareness Week, she said, she needs to be on guard against attempts to indoctrinate her own children. “The idea of having two dads, they just go, ‘Eww, that’s not right,’ ” she said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/after-decades-in-the-shadows-gays-in-ireland-ready-for-coming-out-party/2015/05/16/9e2bb6e4-f8ca-11e4-a47c-e56f4db884ed_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the MFM [[Facebook page]] was deactivated.

===Poster controversy===
[[File:2015 Irish marriage referendum posters.jpg|thumb|A Mothers and Fathers Matter poster referencing surrogacy, together with a Fine Gael poster denying that the issue was relevant.]]
The 'No' posters published by MFM during the Marriage Equality campaign were widely criticised as an attempt to sow confusion and to conflate different issues (such as [[surrogacy]]) with the Marriage Equality Referendum.  On 24 April 2015, an Irish Times journalist, Conor Pope, filmed and confronted individuals who were removing some of the group's posters from Gardiner Street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRMTRwdXEFE 'Vote No' posters taken down] Conor Pope, YouTube Channel&lt;/ref&gt; Responding, the Yes Equality campaign condemned the removal of any posters, but pointed out that their canvassers had also been abused and threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/no-campaign-garda-report-posters-ireland-same-sex-2066942-Apr2015/|title=The ‘Yes’ campaign responds to accusations of pulling down ‘No’ posters|work=The Journal|date=24 April 2015|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One Dublin hotel (notorious for courting publicity) offered a discount to guests who took down 'No' posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/same-sex-vote-hotel-offers-50-rate-for-removing-no-posters-1.2190003|title=Same-sex vote: Hotel offers 50% rate for removing ‘No’ posters|work=[[The Irish Times]]|last=McGreevy|first=Ronan|date=27 April 2015|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claimed that the 'No' posters were insulting to single parents, adoptive parents and heterosexual and same-sex parents who had availed of assisted human reproduction.  One such mother said "The poster is nonsense – it implies that surrogacy is simply for same-sex couples. There are many parents, myself included, that have had children thanks to the help of other people. To say that I am not the mother of my children because I could not biologically carry them is an insulting suggestion, and one that is clearly aimed at shaming families that do not conform to this group’s narrow view of what constitutes a family.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/families-hit-out-over-no-campaign-poster-criticising-surrogacy-31165662.html|title=Families hit out over 'No' campaign poster criticising surrogacy|work=[[Irish Independent]]|last=Kearns|first=David|date=23 April 2015|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/noel-whelan-no-side-posters-may-prove-counterproductive-1.2186624|title=No side posters may prove counterproductive: Many children are already being born with the assistance of surrogacy|work=[[The Irish Times]]|last=Whelan|first=Noel|date=24 April 2015|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/noel-whelan-what-s-the-difference-between-civil-partnership-and-marriage-1.2195514|title=What’s the difference between civil partnership and marriage?|work=Irish Times|last=Whelan|first=Noel|date=1 May 2015|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tánaiste [[Joan Burton]] described the posters as "demeaning", saying "The notion that people who have been raised in anything other than the kind of perfect family situation that the No people describe, frankly, I find it undermining of people in a way I think is regrettable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/burton-attacks-demeaning-posters-from-campaigners-against-same-sex-marriage-1.2190013|title=Burton attacks ‘demeaning’ posters from campaigners against same-sex marriage|work=[[The Irish Times]]|last=Kelly|first=Fiach|date=27 April 2015|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early May 2015, the couple featured in the stock photos used on MFM posters denounced the use of their image in the No campaign.  Releasing a statement through [[Amnesty International]], they said "We completely support same-sex marriage, and we believe that same-sex couples should, of course, be able to adopt, as we believe that they are equally able to provide children with much-needed love and care. To suggest otherwise is offensive to us, and to many others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/couple-denounce-use-of-their-image-on-no-campaign-posters-1.2203515|title=Couple denounce use of their image on No campaign posters|work=[[The Irish Times]]|last=Murtagh|first=Peter|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 May, the retired Archdeacon of Dublin, [[Gordon Linney]], described the posters as [[homophobia|homophobic]], saying that the posters' "real target is gay people and a crude attempt to discredit them as suitable parents. This is where we can talk candidly about homophobia because the implication is that gay people are at best incapable of caring for children or at worst a danger to children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/archdeacon-says-no-referendum-posters-are-homophobic-1.2204082|title=Archdeacon says ‘No’ referendum posters are homophobic|work=[[The Irish Times]]|last=McGarry|first=Patsy|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent [[Referendum Commission]] received "dozens" of complaints about the posters, and pointed to a statement on their website on the question, which reads "The [[Children and Family Relationships Act 2015]] deals with parentage in the cases of donor–assisted births but not with surrogacy.  The Act has been passed and will be enacted regardless of the outcome of the marriage equality referendum."  They added "In view of the number of complaints regarding the surrogacy poster, the Commission may comment further in the coming weeks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecorknews.ie/articles/poster-campaign-controversy-18570|title=Poster Campaign Controversy|work=TheCorkNews.ie|date=24 April 2015|accessdate=26 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822105258/http://thecorknews.ie/articles/poster-campaign-controversy-18570|archivedate=22 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carol Coulter, former ''Irish Times'' legal affairs editor and director of the child care law reporting project, also wrote that the referendum had nothing to do with surrogacy, and pointed out that where it was legal, such as in the UK, it was mostly availed of by heterosexual, married couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/why-surrogacy-has-nothing-to-do-with-same-sex-marriage-1.2189717|title=Why surrogacy has nothing to do with same-sex marriage|work=[[The Irish Times]]|last=Coulter|first=Carol|date=27 April 2015|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5467">'''NLA media access''' (often shortened to '''the NLA''') is the [[collecting society]] for [[United Kingdom|UK]] newspapers, a privately owned limited company. It undertakes [[collective rights management]] on behalf of its members and licenses companies, such as [[press cutting agency|press cuttings agencies and media monitoring firms]].

== History ==
The NLA was founded in 1996 by the following eight UK national newspaper publishers, who are equal shareholders:

* [[Associated Newspapers]]
* [[Financial Times]]
* [[Guardian Media Group]]
* [[Independent News and Media|Independent News &amp; Media]]
* [[Northern and Shell]]
* [[News International]]
* [[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]
* [[Trinity Mirror]]

NLA media access distributes over £22m each year to national and regional newspapers in respect of copyright works.  In 2009 NLA media access licensed over 1000m copies of newspaper cuttings from more than 1,400 titles and collected licence fees from over 8300 licensees (representing over 150,000 organisations).

In 2006 the NLA launched eClips, an online database of newspaper cuttings. In 2008, it launched ClipSearch, allowing anyone to search and retrieve original newspaper articles from around the UK, updated 72 hours after publication. In 2009, it introduced Newspapers for Schools, to encourage and ease the access of newspaper material to schools throughout the UK. NLA media access also supports the Journalism Diversity Fund which provides bursaries to students from ethnically and socially diverse backgrounds looking to train as journalists.

== Clipping services litigation ==
{{main|Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA) v The Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA)}}
In 2010, NLA media access introduced a licence covering [[media monitoring service]]s which crawl sites and offer paid-for services based on its filtered results.  Relevant results are shown to clients who pay Meltwater but do not themselves have a licence from a newspaper company or copyright service to read the original mention.&lt;ref name="Tech Dirt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Masnick|first=Mike|title=UK's Times Online Starts Blocking Aggregators Hours After Aggregators Win Copyright Tribunal Ruling Against Newspapers|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100317/1128238596.shtml|newspaper=Tech Dirt|date=March 17, 2010|authorlink=Mike Masnick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Charlton|first=Graham|title=The NLA explains why it is going after the news aggregators|url=http://econsultancy.com/blog/4902-the-nla-explains-why-it-is-going-after-the-news-aggregators|publisher=Econsultancy.com|date=3 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case revolved around whether a client lacking a licence would infringe copyright by being shown, and viewing, the extracts from copyrighted material in this way (it was common ground that to subsequently view a full article would require a licence). The majority of media monitoring agencies signed up for the new NLA web licence with the exception of [[Meltwater Group]] who argued no licence was required by its clients for this purpose, and in conjunction with the [[Public Relations Consultants Association|PRCA]] referred the scheme to the Copyright Tribunal, and the matter was escalated.

In May 2010 the NLA announced action in the High Court and on 26 November the High Court ruled in favour of the NLA. The case was appealed and heard by the UK's Court of Appeal in June 2011.  They upheld the decision in the High Court case, implying that most (if not all) businesses subscribing to a media monitoring service that contains content from online newspapers would require a licence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communicatemagazine.co.uk/news/2059-high-court-rules-against-meltwater-and-prca High Court rules against Meltwater and PRCA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130150722/http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/news/2059-high-court-rules-against-meltwater-and-prca |date=2010-11-30 }} Communicate magazine, November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

However this was reversed by the [[UK Supreme Court]] in 2013,&lt;ref name="judgment"&gt;http://www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0202_Judgment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; who ruled Meltwater's activities legal, subject to certain questions referred to the [[European Court of Justice]] and intended to clarify matters of a cross-border nature. The rationale was that viewing of copyright works was not, and had never been, illegal in either the UK or European law,&lt;ref name="judgment" /&gt;{{rp|item 36}} and Article 5.1 of the European Directive Directive [[2001/29/EC]] (which covers "temporary copies"&lt;ref name="judgment" /&gt;{{rp|item 9,11}}]) permitted automated copying of a temporary nature for a lawful purpose. As mere viewing by Meltware's clients was lawful under UK and EU law, the technical creation of cached copies to enable and facilitate this were also lawful.&lt;ref name="judgment" /&gt;{{rp|item 16–17}}

On 5 June 2014 the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] in Luxembourg ruled in favour of the PRCA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holmesreport.com/news-info/15037/EU-Court-Of-Justice-Delivers-Landmark-Judgment-In-Favour-Of-PRCAMeltwater-Against-NLA.aspx EU Court Of Justice delivers landmark judgment in favour of PRCA/Meltwater against NLA]&lt;/ref&gt; and found that browsing and viewing articles online does not require authorisation from the copyright holder.

The '''Netherlands–Venezuela Boundary Treaty''' is a 1978 [[treaty]] between territory of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Venezuela]] which [[Boundary delimitation|delimits]] the [[maritime boundary]] between territory of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and Venezuelan territory.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ewan W. (2003). {{Google books|E7-menNPxREC|''International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas,'' p. 592|page=592}}; Jagota, S. P. {{Google books|7H59YEj-zC0C|''Maritime Boundaries,'' pp. 105-108.|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the treaty was concluded in 1978, the treaty set out the boundary between what was known as the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and Venezuela. Today, it establishes the boundary between [[Aruba]] and Venezuela, between [[Curaçao]] and Venezuela, and between the [[BES islands]] and Venezuela.

The treaty was signed on 31 March 1978. The text of the treaty establishes a complex [[border]] that is set out in four individual [[ocean|maritime]] sectors. Sector A creates the boundary between the ocean west of [[Aruba]] and Venezuelan territory. Sector B creates the boundary between the Venezuelan mainland and the [[Leeward Islands]] of the Netherlands Antilles (including [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]]). Sector C creates the boundary between [[Bonaire]] and Venezuelan territory. Finally, further north, Sector D creates the boundary between [[Isla Aves]] (Venezuela) and [[Saba]] and [[Sint Eustatius]] (Netherlands Antilles). The far eastern point of Sector C and the far western point of Sector D are connected by the west–east [[United States]] – Venezuela boundary, which was agreed to in the [[United States – Venezuela Maritime Boundary Treaty]], signed just days before the Netherlands–Venezuela treaty.

In places, the boundary lines were adjusted from the natural equidistant lines because of considerations of the placement of oilfields and other mineral deposits in the area.

The full name of the treaty is ''Boundary Delimitation Treaty between the Republic of Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1425">In [[Civil_law_(legal_system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, a nominate contract is a standardized contractual relationship that has a special designation attached to it (e.g., purchase and sale, lease, loan, insurance), as opposed to innominate contracts (which are not standardized and therefore have no set name).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.law-dictionary.org/NOMINATE+CONTRACT,+civil+law.asp?q=NOMINATE+CONTRACT%2C+civil+law| title= NOMINATE CONTRACT, civil law |website=law dictionary, a free online law dictionary search engine for definitions of law terminology &amp; legal terms. | publisher= law-dictionary.org | accessdate= 14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obligor and obligee have rights and obligations specially prescribed by law. Nominate contracts are usually statutorily required to include certain express terms (''essentialia'')—depending on their kind—and are construed to include terms implied in law.

==Examples in law==
In [[Quebec]], Book V of the Civil Code deals with Obligations, Title II deals with nominate contracts. It is further subdivided into various chapters, dealing with several types of nominate contracts (sale, gift, lease, insurance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ccq.lexum.org/ccq/title.do?lang=en&amp;book=5&amp;title=25| title= Annotated Civil Code of Quebec -English | publisher= Lexum | accessdate= January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7539">[[File:Paul Comly French cph.3c28329.jpg|thumb|Paul Comly French as State Director of the Pennsylvania Unit, W.P.A. Federal Writers' Project]]
'''Paul Comly French''' (March 19, 1903 – June 3, 1960) was an American reporter, writer, anti-war activist and non-profit executive.

==Early life and career==
Paul C. French was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], to a [[Quaker]] family.  He was a writer for ''[[The Philadelphia Record]]'' newspaper. He was married twice; first to Marie who died in 1943 and left him with two sons Paul and Peter. His second wife was Dorothy, with whom he had a son Bruce and daughter Susan.  His brother  Charles C. French was also a writer and a professor.

He served for a time as [[Smedley Butler]]'s personal secretary in Philadelphia.

As a reporter he covered the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]] for the Philadelphia Record in 1932.
It was to French, who was then writing both for the Record and the New York Post, that former General Butler in 1934 shared his allegations of a [[Business Plot]] to depose President Roosevelt.

==[[Federal Writers Project]]- Pennsylvania==

French was initially the assistant to the first director of the Pennsylvania Writers Project (PWP),  Logan B. Sisson.  The project began in July 1935. French replaced Sisson within the year.

French’s term was marred by an acrimonious relationship with Henry Alsberg the national director of the [[Federal Writers Project]] and, among all the state directors, was one of the few to constantly balk at the editorial dictates of the Washington staff. In a letter dated June 23, 1939, French appealed to the executive director of Pennsylvania’s Historical Commission, Maj. Frank Melvin, for assistance in convincing Alsberg to finally publish the state’s guide. He accused the national office of being overly concerned with details, citing “the copy cannot be considered final because our margins are an inch and a quarter, instead of an inch, and our indents for paragraphs are ten rather than five spaces.” French was also unable to broker a truce between the [[Newspaper Guild]] and the Writers Union, two leftwing labor organizations with writers on the PWP staff that eventually conspired to oust French in 1939.

By the summer of 1939, shifting political winds had left the Federal Writers Project out to dry. The previous year, both the [[Dies Committee]] to Investigate Un-American Activities and the House appropriations committee attacked the Federal Writers Project for being a hotbed of [[Communism]], accusations based mainly on the radical leanings of some writers in the project’s frenetic New York City office. Alsberg successfully defended the FWP from the trumped-up charges, but negative publicity during the hearings left a bitter aftertaste in the public’s mind.

==Conscientious Objector National Leader==
He was the first Executive Secretary for the National Service Board for Religious Objection and served from 1940 until 1947. The [[National Service Board for Religious Objectors]] (NSBRO) was a voluntary association of religious organizations which acted as a voice for the churches and conscientious objectors to the Selective Service System in the United States in matters regarding the administration of the draft of conscientious objectors. It was created on 26 November 1940 as a merger of the short-lived National Council for Religious Objectors (NCRO) with the Civilian Service Board. The NCRO had been established on 11 October 1940 by joint action of the Mennonite Central Committee, the American Friends Service Committee, and the Brethren Service Committee.

The function of the NSBRO was to serve as the liaison between the churches and other groups having conscientious objectors to military service among their members. Although it did not administer any [[Civilian Public Service]] (CPS) projects or camps, it performed a valuable service. It was not the sole channel to the National [[Selective Service]] office for those groups who administered CPS, since they could and did on occasion deal directly with Selective Service, but it nevertheless carried most of the liaison work. For this purpose it was organized into the following sections: Camp Section, Complaint Section, and Assignment Section. The Camp Section worked in connection with the selection of sites for CPS camps; the Complaint Section helped men who were not properly classified or were denied their claim to conscientious objector status; the Assignment Section was the channel for transmitting the assignment to the proper CPS camp for the COs who were being drafted.

==Executive director of CARE==
In 1947 French became executive director of CARE after having served as general manager for several months.  CARE (originally "[[Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe]]", and later "Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere"), was founded  in 1945 with the idea to secure financial backing for overseas food relief packages for a devastated Europe.  The relief came in [[CARE Package|"CARE Packages"]], [http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&amp;objkey=245] which were [[U.S. Army]] surplus [[10-in-1 food parcel]]s left over from the planned U.S. invasion of [[Japan]]. The service let Americans send the packages to friends and families in [[Europe]]. Each CARE Package cost $10 and was guaranteed to reach its addressee within four months.  In 1955 Paul French left CARE and founded a new non-profit organization called World.Inc. Paul French died on June 3, 1960.

==Scholarship==
[[File:One Newark Center fr Cherry St jeh.jpg|thumb|right|Building at Seton Hall's school of law in [[Newark, New Jersey]].]]Franzese’s scholarship focuses on two main areas of the law: [[government ethics]] and [[property law]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-twsPhiladelphiaInquirer-11|[11]]][[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-twsMSNBC-12|[12]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Her research into property law includes landlord-tenant reform,&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-NJ.com-8|[8]]][[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-13|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; common interest communities including homeowners' boards,&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-twsNYT4-14|[14]]][[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-twsRutgers-15|[15]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and [[affordable housing]], including a legal analysis of the [[Mount Laurel doctrine]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-twsFordhamLawReview-16|[16]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In addition to her scholarship, Franzese wrote two general-purpose guidebooks for students, including ''A Short &amp; Happy Guide To Being A College Student'' and ''A Short &amp; Happy Guide To Being A Law Student.''&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-twsCBS-17|[17]]][[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-twsColumbiaSpectator-18|[18]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Franzese has advocated for a right to counsel for low-income tenants facing eviction&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-19|[19]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and moderated fair housing programs.&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-20|[20]]]&lt;/sup&gt; She is the current chair of the New Jersey State Bar Association Commission on Professionalism.&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-21|[21]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Franzese has written about the law as an instrument for social justice in the ''New Jersey Law Journal'',&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-22|[22]]]&lt;/sup&gt; has received national attention for her scholarship on the struggles of indigent tenants,&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-23|[23]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and has been the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including the 2017 Justice Marie Garibaldi Award for Distinguished Service and Excellence. Her research and recommendations have been used by legislatures to formulate key ethics reform legislation.&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-24|[24]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Teaching==
Franzese was featured as one of the 26 best law teachers in the nation in the book ''What the Best Law Teachers Do''.&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-25|[25]]]&lt;/sup&gt; She also lectured for ten years at [[BarBri]], a bar-exam preparation firm, serving as its national lecturer on property law.&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-twsNYTimes-26|[26]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Franzese urges that law professors emphasize a "conceptual, contextual and empathetic understanding".&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-twsWallStreetJrnl-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Franzese encourages law students to have [[empathy]] with others as a way of better understanding the law and becoming more effective lawyers.&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-twsHarvard-4|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; She has written on the benefits of a law degree and reasons to go to law school.&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-27|[27]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Ethics and reform advocacy==
Franzese is an advocate of ethics reform.&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-twsNJEminentDomain-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; She has served with three [[Governor of New Jersey|governors of New Jersey]]—Governors [[Christine Todd Whitman]], [[Richard Codey]] and [[Jon Corzine]]—on ethics-related commissions. Her ethics reform work led to the promulgation of major legislative reforms, including the Uniform Ethics Code.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In 2014 and again in 2016, Franzese criticized the administration of New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]], stating that officials in the administration conflated their official duties with campaign efforts.&lt;sup&gt;[[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-twsPhiladelphiaInquirer-11|[11]]][[Paula Franzese#cite%20note-twsStarLedger-28|[28]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6199">The '''Police Act 1946''' (1946 c.46) was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that provided for the [[Consolidation (business)|amalgamation]] of smaller borough police forces with county constabularies in [[England]] and [[Wales]], allowed for the merger of county forces in certain circumstances and changed the boundaries of the [[Metropolitan Police District]].

The appointed day for the amalgamations was 1 April 1947. On that date forty-five non-county borough police forces were merged with those of the counties in which they were situated. In the case of fourteen of these boroughs, they had already been temporarily placed under the county police by the '''Defence (Amalgamation of Police Forces) Regulations 1942'''. Section 13 of the 1946 Act made these amalgamations permanent. One non-county borough force, [[Cambridge City Police]], was allowed to continue, the city having a larger population than the surrounding county. The Act made similar provision for [[Peterborough City Police]], although in the event it formed a combined force with the [[Soke of Peterborough]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Allen, ''The Police of England'', Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, Vol. 37, No. 5 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1137958]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1947 mergers there were 133 police forces covering England and Wales:&lt;ref&gt;''Fewer police forces'', The Times, 1 April 1947&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Metropolitan Police]]
*[[City of London Police]]
*55 county police forces †
*71 [[county borough]] police forces
*1 non-county borough force (Cambridge)
*4 combined police forces
† The actual number was 53, as the Lincolnshire Constabulary was jointly maintained by three counties.
 
Section 3 of the Act allowed for the voluntary amalgamation of county and county borough forces, while Section 4 gave the [[Home Secretary]] the power to make amalgamation schemes of constabularies.

Section 16 provided for the "rectification" of the Metropolitan Police District, realigning it with contemporary local government boundaries.

Section 18 placed the [[Isles of Scilly]] under the [[Cornwall County Constabulary]]

==Later amalgamations==
The Home Secretary's powers under Section 4 of the Act were used on a number of occasions:
*[[Hampshire Constabulary]] was formed in 1948 by a merger of [[Hampshire County Constabulary]] and [[Isle of Wight County Constabulary]]. This made permanent the 1943 merger of the two constabularies (as Hampshire Joint Police) under the 1942 Defence Regulations.
*[[Mid Wales Constabulary]] was formed on 1 April 1948 from [[Breconshire Constabulary]], [[Radnorshire Constabulary]] and [[Montgomeryshire Constabulary]]
*[[Gwynedd Constabulary]] was formed in 1950 from [[Anglesey Constabulary]], [[Caernarvonshire Constabulary]] and [[Merionethsire Constabulary]]
*[[Leicestershire and Rutland Constabulary]] was formed on 1 April 1951 from [[Leicestershire Constabulary]], [[Rutland Constabulary]]
*[[Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire Constabulary]] was formed on 1 July 1958 by the merger of [[Cardiganshire Constabulary]] and [[Carmarthenshire Constabulary]]. The amalgamation followed the unfavourable conclusions of an inquiry into the Cardiganshire force.&lt;ref&gt;''Cardiganshire Police Inquiry Findings "Unhealthy Atmosphere Of Intrigue"'', The Times, 23 August 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report of Inquiry into the proposed compulsory amalgamation of the police forces of the County of Carmarthen and the County of Cardigan (Cmnd.374) [http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bopall/ref10990.html bopcris website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084015/http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bopall/ref10990.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Police Merger To Proceed - Draft Scheme For Parliament Soon'', The Times, 22 February 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proactive policing''' is the practice of deterring criminal activity by showing police presence and engaging the public to learn their concerns, thereby preventing crime from taking place in the first place. In contrast, responding to a complaint after a crime has been committed is reactive policing.&lt;ref name=ankony1&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officers' Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement." ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management,'' vol. 22. no. 2 (1999): 120-32.[http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2017 report by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], there is "evidence that a number of proactive policing practices are successful in reducing crime and disorder, at least in the short term, and that most of these strategies do not harm communities' attitudes toward police. However, the effects of proactive policing on other important outcomes—such as on the legality of police behavior and on racially biased behavior—are unclear because of gaps in research... Moreover, evidence on many proactive strategies is limited to near-term, localized impacts. Little is known about the strategies' long-term effects on crime or other outcomes, and about whether and to what extent they will offer crime control benefits at a larger jurisdictional level—for example, across an entire precinct or city."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24928/proactive-policing-effects-on-crime-and-communities|title=Proactive Policing: Effects on Crime and Communities|last=Crime|first=Committee on Proactive Policing: Effects on|last2=Communities|last3=Liberties|first3=and Civil|last4=Justice|first4=Committee on Law and|last5=Education|first5=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and|last6=Sciences|first6=National Academies of|last7=Engineering|last8=Medicine|first8=and|date=2017-11-09|isbn=9780309467100|language=en|doi=10.17226/24928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:California Highway Patrol.jpg|left|thumb|California Highway Patrol]]

Individual officers wields an enormous amount of discretion in enforcing the law (esp, non-dispatched runs like traffic enforcement or street crime). What is surprising is the public belief that police are usually eager and motivated to do their job. Thus, when a particular crime problem becomes apparent, it is often approached by monetary related arguments, such as the need for more police, equipment, training etc.; rather than by non-monetary related approaches, such as recognizing how a high perception of [[social alienation|alienation]] among police officers from the citizens of the community where they patrol reduces morale and spawns police indifference, inactivity, and apathy.&lt;ref name=ankony2&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "Community Alienation and Its Impact on Police," ''Police Chief,'' Oct. 1999: 150-53. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/the-impact-of-community-alienation-on-police-officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of alienation is especially relevant as the contemporary [[community policing]] movement emphasizes proactive law enforcement strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Bobinsky, Robert, "Reflections on Community-Oriented Policing," FBI Law Enforcement Journal Bulletin, Mar. 1994: 15-19.[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/147475NCJRS.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mastrofski, Stephen, Robert Worden, and Jeffery Snipes, "Law Enforcement in a time of Community Policing, " ''Criminology'' (Nov. 1995):539-563.&lt;/ref&gt; Effective community policing requires that police officers work closely with local citizens in designing and implementing a variety of proactive crime prevention and control measures. To accomplish these initiatives, it is crucial that officers feel closely integrated with the majority of citizens in the community they serve. Typically, this means that officers perceive themselves as sharing important community values and beliefs and ''being confident of community support'' in the decisions they make.&lt;ref name=ankony2/&gt;

As the perception of community alienation increases among police officers, their sense of confidence or mastery in decision making will decrease, and so too their motivation for proactive enforcement. The impact of highly publicized "pro-police" verdicts of brutality incidents (i.e., Rodney King, Los Angeles 1991; Malice Green, Detroit 1992; O.J. Simpson, Los Angeles 1994; Michael Brown, Ferguson 2014; Eric Garner, New York 2014; and Freddie Gray, Baltimore 2015) are related to the level of perceived alienation experienced by police and thus their willingness to respond proactively to serious crime.&lt;ref name=ankony2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mortaz, C., "Alienation among Police Officers," Journal of Police Science and Administration, Mar. 1983: 23-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, M, "Alienation among Veteran Police Officers," ''Police Chief,'' Feb. 1987: 38-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The New National Crime Wave," ''Wall Street Journal'', Ms. Mac Donald, May 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; FBI Director James Comey and DEA chief Chuck Rosenberg suggested the "[[Ferguson effect]]" as the cause to recent spikes in crime in several large cities, especially Baltimore, Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Kevin, "DEA chief: Comey 'spot on' linking Ferguson impact to crime surge," ''USA Today'', November 4, 2015. [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/04/comey-chuck-rosenberg-dea-ferguson/75160884/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially a sociological concept developed by several classical and contemporary theorists, alienation is a condition in social relationships reflected by a low degree of integration or common values and a high degree of distance or isolation between individuals, or between an individual and a group of people in a community or work environment. Alienation is closely aligned with the concept of mastery. Mastery is typically defined as a state of mind in which an individual feels autonomous and experiences confidence in his or her ability, skill, and knowledge to control or influence external events. The greater the level of alienation an individual experiences in a community or work setting, the weaker will be their sense of mastery.&lt;ref name=ankony2/&gt;

For police officers, a strong sense of mastery is particularly vital in relation to proactive law enforcement. Proactive enforcement is usually defined as the predisposition of a police officer to be actively involved in preventing and investigating crime. Because police patrol work is highly unsupervised, most officers have considerable discretion or personal initiative regarding their level of proactive behavior on the streets. Again, it would seem logical that the stronger the level of perceived community alienation among police officers, the weaker will be their sense of mastery and motivation to engage in proactive law enforcement behavior.&lt;ref name=ankony2/&gt;

==Elements==

Proactive policing is closely related to the practice of community policing.&lt;ref&gt;Burden, O. "Community Policing," ''National Fraternal Order of Police Journal,'' Fall/Winter: 31-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Community policing's goal is "problem solving." Community policing emphasizes proactive enforcement that proposes street crime can be reduced through greater community involvement and integration between citizens and police. Community policing departments and officers must commit time to develop a "partnership" with the community to: 1) Prevent and counter crime; 2) Maintain order; and 3) Reduce the fear of crime.&lt;ref name=ankony1/&gt; Police organization is decentralized with every police officer and detective having a neighborhood to patrol with agreed upon goals and objectives to solve. Police officers must feel integrated with the majority of the citizens of the community where they patrol, and that they perceive themselves as sharing similar values and beliefs so they are confident in their decision making ability. Each police officer must get out of their cars (not just drive by and grin and wave) to visit with citizens and businesses to learn the residents concerns and show they're a friend and protector—in contrast to "strict law enforcement" or "reactive policing" which doesn't view the citizens as customers.&lt;ref name=ankony1/&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some people argue that policing should rightfully be restricted to reactive policing with a corollary that proactive policing is improper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reason.com/archives/2013/03/27/when-proactive-policing-becomes-harassme|title=When Proactive Policing Becomes Harassment|work=Reason.com|date=2013-03-27|first=Jacob|last=Sullum}}&lt;/ref&gt; if not illegal.

'''Raymond G. Frey''' ({{IPAc-en|f|r|aɪ}}; 1941–2012) was a Professor of Philosophy at [[Bowling Green State University]], specializing in [[moral philosophy|moral]], [[political philosophy|political]] and [[legal philosophy]], and author or editor of a number of books, including ''Interests and Rights: The Case Against Animals'' (1980), ''Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide'' (1998, with [[Gerald Dworkin]] and [[Sissela Bok]]), and ''The Oxford Handbook of Animal Ethics'' (2011, with [[Tom Beauchamp]], eds.).

==Biography==
Frey obtained his B.A. in philosophy in 1966 from [[The College of William and Mary]], his M.A. in 1968 from the [[University of Virginia]], and his D.Phil. in 1974 from the [[University of Oxford]] – where his supervisor was [[R. M. Hare]] – for a thesis on "Rules and Consequences as Grounds for Moral Judgment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgsu.edu/downloads/cas/file47413.pdf "Curriculum vitae"], Bowling Green State University, accessed 17 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David DeGrazia]] wrote in 1991 that Frey was one of five authors – along with [[Peter Singer]], [[Tom Regan]], [[Mary Midgley]], and [[Steve Sapontzis]] – who had made significant philosophical contributions to the work of placing animals within [[ethical theory]].&lt;ref name=DeGrazia&gt;DeGrazia, David. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ken/summary/v001/1.1.degrazia.html "The Moral Status of Animals and Their Use in Research: A Philosophical Review"], ''[[Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal]]''. Volume 1, Number 1, March 1991, pp. 48-70&lt;/ref&gt;

Frey writes from a [[Preference utilitarianism|preference utilitarian]] perspective, as does Singer. Preference utilitarianism defines an act as good insofar as it fulfills the preferences (interests) of the greatest number. In his early work, ''Interests and Rights'' (1980), Frey disagreed with Singer – who in his ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975) wrote that the interests of nonhuman animals must be included when judging the consequences of an act – on the grounds that animals have no interests. Frey argued that interests are dependent on desire, and that one cannot have a desire without a corresponding belief. He argued further that animals have no beliefs because they are unable to comprehend the concept of a belief (that is, they are unable to hold a second-order belief: a belief about a belief), which he argues requires language: "If someone were to say, e.g. 'The cat believes that the door is locked,' then that person is holding, as I see it, that the cat holds the declarative sentence 'The door is locked' to be true; and I can see no reason whatever for crediting the cat or any other creature which lacks language, including human infants, with entertaining declarative sentences." He concludes that animals have no interests.&lt;ref&gt;Frey, R.G. "Why Animals Lack Beliefs and Desires," in Peter Singer and Tom Regan (eds.). ''Animal Rights and Human Obligations''. Prentice Hall, 1989 (2nd edition), p. 40.
*Merriam, Garret. ''Virtue Ethics and the Moral Significance of Animals''. ProQuest, 2008, pp. 144–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Counter-arguments include that first-order beliefs may be held in the absence of second-order ones – that is, a non-human animal or human infant might hold a belief while failing to understand the concept of belief — and that human beings could not have developed language in the first place without some pre-verbal beliefs.&lt;ref name=DeGrazia/&gt; Frey has since rejected some of his early conclusions. The importance of ''Interests and Rights'', according to DeGrazia, lay in its rigorous treatment of the problem of animal minds and moral status.&lt;ref&gt;DeGrazia, David. ''Taking Animals Seriously''. Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major world [[religion]]s take varied positions on the morality of [[capital punishment]]&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenberg|first1=David F|title=Siting the Death Penalty Internationally|journal=Journal of the American Bar Association|date=May 2, 2008|volume=33|issue=2|pages=295–343|doi=10.1111/j.1747-4469.2008.00105.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and have historically impacted the way in which the [[government]] handles punishment practices.&lt;ref name="Grasmick - Religion, Punitive Justice, and Support for the Death Penalty"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grasmick|first1=Harold G|title=Religion, Punitive Justice, and Support for the Death Penalty|journal=Justice Quarterly|date=June 1993|volume=10|issue=2|pages=289–314|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jquart10&amp;div=27&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=&amp;collection=journals|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the viewpoints of some religions have changed over time, its influence on capital punishment generally depends on the existence of a religious moral code and how closely religion influences the government.&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; Religious moral codes are often based on a body of teachings, such as the [[Old Testament]] or the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt;

According to the [[Kitab-i-Aqdas]], the central book of the [[Baha'i faith]], certain offenses such as [[murder]] and [[arson]] are punishable by the death penalty with the option of life imprisonment as an alternative. This likely stems from the belief that revenge is forbidden and that people should await the prescribed punishment for their offenses.&lt;ref name="Kitab-i-Aqdas"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baha'u'llah|title=Baha'i Reference Library|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-103.html|website=Baha'i International Community|accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] has a strong belief in compassion for the lives of others, as stated in the panca-sila ([[five precepts]]). There is an understanding of healing people who have committed crimes rather than retaliation against them. For these reasons, Buddhism has generally opposed the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horigan|first1=Damien|title=Of Compassion and Capital Punishment: A Buddhist Perspective on the Death Penalty|journal=American Journal of Jurisprudence|date=1996|volume=41|pages=271–288|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ajj41&amp;div=16&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=&amp;collection=journals|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christianity]] has changed its perspective on the death penalty over time and different [[Christian denomination]]s have different teachings on it. Many early Christians were strongly opposed to the death penalty and magistrates who enforced it could be [[excommunicated]]. Attitudes gradually began to relax in the fifth century. In the thirteenth century, [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that capital punishment was a form of "[[lawful slaying]]", which became the standard [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] teaching on the issue for centuries. During the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]], [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] defended the death penalty, but [[Quakers]], [[Church of the Brethren|Brethren]], and [[Mennonites]] have opposed it since their founding. Since the [[Second Vatican Council]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]] has generally opposed the death penalty and, in August 2018, [[Pope Francis]] revised the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] to explicitly condemn it in all cases, as an inadmissible attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/bollettino/pubblico/2018/08/02/0556/01209.html?utm_source=|title=Nuova redazione del n. 2267 del Catechismo della Chiesa Cattolica sulla pena di morte|publisher=[[Holy See Press Office]]|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism]] has historically not taken a stance on the death penalty and has little influence on the governments opinion of it,&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; but India (an 80% Hindu nation)&lt;ref name="India Census"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_And_You/religion.aspx|website=Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, India|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the lowest rate of execution of any other country.&lt;ref name="The next frontier"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=David|title=The Next Frontier: National Development, Political Change, and the Death Penalty in Asia|date=February 2, 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=1–544|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZyIsBaNkfkUC&amp;dq=death+penalty+in+india|accessdate=March 8, 2018|isbn=9780199887569}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely due to the Hindu belief in [[Ahimsa]], or non-violence, which became very apparent during Gandhi's time&lt;ref name="Religion, violence, and conflict resolution"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gopin|first1=Mark|title=Religion, Violence, and Conflict resolution|journal=Peace and Change|date=January 1997|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–31|doi=10.1111/0149-0508.00035|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0149-0508.00035/full|accessdate=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was supported by India's ancient emperor [[Ashoka]], who was the only leader in the countries history to openly oppose the death penalty.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt;

Many [[Islam]]ic nations have governments run directly by the code of [[Sharia law]].&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; The Qur'an explicitly states that the taking of a life results in the taking of ones own, leading most Islamic governments to support capital punishment. There are certain actions in Islam, such as [[adultery]], that are recognized to result in the death penalty and the concept of religious "[[fatwas]]", in which the government allows an individual or a group of people to kill, is found only in Islam.&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; However not all Islamic nations have the death penalty, for example [[Djibouti]] is an Islamic abolitionist nation.

[[Judaism]] has a history of debate over the death penalty but generally disagrees with the practice. Although the [[Torah]] describes over 30 situations where the death penalty would be appropriate, there are many limitations that have made it difficult to implement. Since 1954 Israel has outlawed the use of the death penalty, except for cases of genocide and treason.&lt;ref name="God and the Executioner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davison|first1=Douglas|title=God and the Executioner: The Influence of Western Religion on the Death Penalty|journal=William and Mary Bill of Rights Journal|date=December 2000|volume=9|issue=1|pages=137–170|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/wmbrts9&amp;div=12&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=&amp;collection=journals|accessdate=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'í Faith==
{{main|Bahá'í laws}}
The Baha'i faith is in favor of capital punishment.&lt;ref name="Kitab-i-Aqdas" /&gt; The [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]], the central book of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] written by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], includes death by immolation as a potential punishment for murder or arson, along with life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="aqdas-law"&gt;"Should anyone intentionally destroy a house by fire, him also shall ye burn; should anyone deliberately take another’s life, him also shall ye put to death. Take ye hold of the precepts of God with all your strength and power, and abandon the ways of the ignorant. Should ye condemn the arsonist and the murderer to life imprisonment, it would be permissible according to the provisions of the Book." {{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |year=1873 |title=The Kitáb-i-Aqdas: The Most Holy Book |page = 41 |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=978-0-85398-999-8 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-5.html#gr62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The details of capital punishment were not explicitly mentioned and are left up to future society to decide. Details such as severity of the crime and methods of punishment are left up to the [[Universal House of Justice]].&lt;ref name="Kitab-i-Aqdas" /&gt; Regarding arson, there is a difference in what type of "house" is burned. A person may be punished accordingly depending on the structure set on fire.&lt;ref name="Kitab-i-Aqdas" /&gt;

The Baha'i faiths views on capital punishment stem from the faiths strong belief in bettering society as a whole.&lt;ref name="Some Answered Question" /&gt; There is a very strong focus on not showing retaliation or getting revenge,&lt;ref name="Some Answered Question" /&gt; but rather that it is the duty of society to punish criminals for the safety of its people.&lt;ref name="Kitab-i-Aqdas" /&gt; It is believed that constantly building prisons and coming up with ways to punish crimes is instilling the wrong ideas in the people. Instead of focusing on punishing crime and waiting for crime to happen, people should focus their energy on education on how to be a good person. They want to focus on diminishing crime rather than punishing it.&lt;ref name="Some Answered Question"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bahá’u’lláh|title=Some Answered Questions|url=http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/abdul-baha/some-answered-questions/|website=Baha'i Reference Library|publisher=Baha'i International Community|accessdate=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a strong belief that the death of the murderer actually brings mercy to their soul. This is because they view God as just and that he will give no additional punishment to the soul after being put to death. Being put to death is seen as atonement for the crime.&lt;ref name="Selections from the writings of..."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abdu’l-Baha|title=Selections From the Writings of Abdu’l-Bahá|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAB/sab-153.html|website=Baha'i Reference Library|publisher=Baha'i International Community|accessdate=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{further|Capital punishment#Buddhism|Five Precepts|Noble Eightfold Path|Ahimsa#Buddhism|Buddhist ethics#Killing, causing others to kill|Buddhism and violence#Teachings, interpretations, and practices}}

Although the death penalty is generally opposed in Buddhist nations, it is difficult to identify a specific Buddhist opinion on capital punishment because some countries that are majority Buddhist to not follow religious principles at all.&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; Buddhist principles may not carry much weight, even in the case of a Buddhist ruler, because there is no direct effort of Buddhist followers to encourage pacifism in their country. The [[five precepts]] are not a divine order from god, they are merely a set of ethical guidelines to live by. For this reason, rulers do not necessarily have to worry about being punished by god for not following them, and some leaders may chose to simply ignore these guidelines when trying to run a country.&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt;

===Buddhist opposition to capital punishment===

The first of the [[Five Precepts]] (Panca-sila) is to abstain from destruction of life.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt; Chapter 10 of the [[Dhammapada]] states:
:Everyone fears punishment; everyone fears death, just as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill. Everyone fears punishment; everyone loves life, as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt;

This concept is meant to encourage compassion ([[Karuṇā|karuna]]) and that everyone has the opportunity to reach enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt; Buddhism retains the idea that all life should be valued and valuing the life of someone who does not necessarily value the life of others shows great compassion and non-violence ([[ahimsa]]). The concept of ahimsa also includes Karma, which recognizes that killing is an example of bad karma &lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; and that killing for revenge is seen as counterproductive.&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; It is believed that even the lives of murderers have value. There is a strong focus on rehabilitation and killing people takes away their opportunity be helped.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt; Killing for revenge is seen as counterproductive.&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt;

Chapter 26, the final chapter of the Dhammapada, states, "Him I call a [[brahmin]] who has put aside weapons and renounced violence toward all creatures. He neither kills nor helps others to kill."&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt; The story of the Jhanasanda-[[Jataka]] contains a similar message in talking about a prince who gets rid of all places of execution.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt; Similarly, the Rajaparikatha-ratnamala contains advice given by the Buddhist Philosopher [[Nagarjuna]] and states that people should have compassion even for murderers and that banishment should be utilized as opposed to killing.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt; This strong emphasis on compassion, in relation to capital punishment, is also evident in the story of [[Angulimala]]. Angulimala was a murderer that everyone in the village feared but despite this, the Buddha headed down the road to where Angulimata is rumored to live. Out of compassion, the Buddha finds him and teaches him how to be a monk. This exemplifies the Buddhist concept of rehabilitation, however, Angulimata had built up too much bad karma previously and died a painful death as a result.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt;

Historically, many Buddhist Kings in India did not impose the death penalty. They charged fines instead and cut off a hand at worst. Some people view this as surprising because many pre-modern societies used capital punishment often. Many places used banishment instead and sent murders off to mountains in the desert with just enough food to survive.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt; Today Japan is very harsh to prisoners and still retains the death penalty, however, during the rule of [[emperor Shomu]] (from 724-749 AD) capital punishment was not allowed.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt; Both the current [[Dalai Lama]] &lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; and his immediate predecessor have openly opposed the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt; The previous Dalai Lama (1879-1933) abolished the death penalty in an attempt to reform Tibet's feudal system after he had previously avoided cases involving capital punishment because of his focus on being a religious figure.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt;

===Actions of Buddhist countries===

[[Bhutan]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Thailand]] all recognize Buddhism as a state religion and use a Buddhist approach to address the issue of capital punishment. Cambodia is the only nation to have officially outlawed the use of the death penalty while neither Thailand or Bhutan have utilized capital punishment in many years.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt;

Thailand is home to about 63 million people, 95% of these people follow [[Theravada Buddhism]] and it has become central to the culture and identity of Thailand.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt; It has been observed that few [[Buddhist monks]] and authorities have taken action against the death penalty. Many monks in Thailand have been surprisingly tolerant. This might be because they come from rural areas of the country where the death penalty is strongly supported, they lack information because it is not a pressing issue and not widely debated, or they simply have no power and are forbidden from making political statements because political authorities are exclusively in control of the government in Thailand.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt; Thailand's war on drugs may potentially explain its current retention of the death penalty. The manufacture and distribution of drugs is considered an offense in which the death penalty is mandatory.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt; There were no executions in Thailand, however, between the years of 1988-1995 and 2004-2007.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt;

[[Sri Lanka]] also recognizes Buddhism as its official state religion but appears to moving toward an increase in its use of capital punishment. It is unclear, however, if this anything to do with its Buddhist beliefs.&lt;ref name="Horigan - Of Compassion and Capital Punishment" /&gt; Unlike Thailand, Sri Lanka has had a long history of political and religious tension due to its history of being ruled by various countries. Its Buddhist influence was weakened by foreign rulers that believed in a suppression of Buddhist culture. A Buddhist monk was sentenced to death after his assassination of Prime Minister [[Bandaranaike]] in 1959 because he felt that he had not lived up to his political promises of promoting Buddhist culture within politics.&lt;ref name="Mercy and Punishment"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alarid|first1=Leanne|title=Mercy and Punishment: Buddhism and the Death Penalty|journal=Social Justice|date=2001|volume=28|issue=1|pages=231–247|jstor=29768067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Edmund Leach believes that the current government of Sri Lanka is made up of Buddhist leaders that do not adhere much to their Buddhist faith. Buddhist leaders in Sri Lanka have either supported the death penalty or been indifferent to its use. There has not been an execution in Sri Lanka since 1977 because the president changed all death sentences to life imprisonment instead. The government is now beginning to bring back the use of the death penalty in response to public demand in order to reduce the number of violent crimes being committed.&lt;ref name="Mercy and Punishment"/&gt;

Although it is [[communist]], [[Laos]] has a much less intense commitment to capital punishment than other nearby communist nations. This is likely due to the strong influence of Theravada Buddhism. [[Myanmar]] also has a strong Theravada Buddhism influence in its country and has not carried out any government ordered executions since 1989.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt; [[Taiwan]] has the same percentage of Buddhists as Thailand does and after interviewing four Taiwanese Buddhists, they were all in agreement that capital punishment goes against Buddhist teachings. They recognized that many Buddhist nations retain the death penalty because Buddhist monks never played a significant role in the political process. Buddhism plays a minor role in Taiwanese politics and one of the monks stated that "the people involved in politics and government are a different group of people than those pursuing spiritual goals."&lt;ref name="Mercy and Punishment" /&gt;

Christian tradition from the [[New Testament]] have come to a range of conclusions about the permissibility and social value of capital punishment. While some hold that a strict reading of certain texts&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Romans 12:19.&lt;/ref&gt; forbids executions, others point to various verses of the New Testament which seem to endorse the death penalty's use.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Acts 25:11 (though this could more properly be seen in St. Paul's declaration that the Christian should submit to the secular government and laws rather than approving of capital punishment).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early Christians were strongly opposed to the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Chadwick1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Chadwick (theologian)|date=17 July 1986|chapter=The Church and the End of the Ancient World|title=The Oxford History of the Classical World|editor1-last=Boardman|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Griffin|editor2-first=Jasper|editor3-last=Murray|editor3-first=Oswyn|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198721123|page=824|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[church order]] from Rome dated to around 200 AD forbids any Christian magistrate from carrying out a death sentence under pain of [[excommunication]].&lt;ref name="Chadwick1986"/&gt; It was also forbidden for any Christian to accuse a person of a crime if that accusation might result in the person being put to death or beaten with lead-weighted leather thongs.&lt;ref name="Chadwick1986"/&gt; In the fifth century, Christian attitudes towards the death penalty gradually became less stringent.&lt;ref name="Chadwick1986"/&gt; In 405, [[Pope Innocent I]] ruled that magistrates who enforced the death penalty could not be excommunicated, although the custom was probably still regarded as immoral.&lt;ref name="Chadwick1986"/&gt;

===Roman Catholic Church===
{{main|Catholic Church and capital punishment}}

Historically and traditionally, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] has classed capital punishment as a form of "lawful slaying", a view defended by theological authorities such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. ''(See also [[Thought of Thomas Aquinas#Aquinas and the death penalty|Aquinas on the death penalty]])''. At various times in the past, the Church has held that, in certain cases, a legal system may be justified in levying a death sentence, such as in cases where the sentence may deter crime, may protect society from potential future acts of violence by an offender, may bring retribution for an offender's wrongful acts, and may even help the offender to move closer to reconciliation with God in the face of death.&lt;ref name=Dulles&gt;{{cite web|first=Avery Cardinal|last=Dulles |title=Catholicism &amp; Capital Punishment | url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2001/04/catholicism-amp-capital-punishment}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1566 [[Roman Catechism]] states this teaching thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Another kind of lawful slaying belongs to the civil authorities, to whom is entrusted power of life and death, by the legal and judicious exercise of which they punish the guilty and protect the innocent. The just use of this power, far from involving the crime of murder, is an act of paramount obedience to this Commandment which prohibits murder. The end of the Commandment is the preservation and security of human life. Now the punishments inflicted by the civil authority, which are the legitimate avengers of crime, naturally tend to this end, since they give security to life by repressing outrage and violence. Hence these words of David: ''In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land, that I might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cin.org/users/james/ebooks/master/trent/tcomm05.htm|last=Akin|first=James|title=The Catechism of Trent: The Fifth Commandment|date=1996|website=Nazareth Resource Library|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This teaching was evident in the writings both of [[Pope Innocent I]] and [[Pope Innocent III]], with the latter stating that "the secular power can without mortal sin carry out a sentence of death, provided it proceeds in imposing the penalty not from hatred but with judgment, not carelessly but with due solicitude."&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, E.C. ''Capital Punishment and Roman Catholic Moral Tradition'' (University of Notre Dame Press, 2003), 104.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the 1911 edition of the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] suggested that Catholics should hold that "the infliction of capital punishment is not contrary to the teaching of the Catholic Church, and the power of the State to visit upon culprits the penalty of death derives much authority from revelation and from the writings of theologians", but that the matter of "the advisability of exercising that power is, of course, an affair to be determined upon other and various considerations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12565a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Capital Punishment (Death Penalty)|publisher=Newadvent.org|date=1 June 1911|accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an address given on September 14, 1952, [[Pope Pius XII]] stated that the Church does not regard the execution of criminals as a violation by the State of the universal right to life, declaring: "When it is a question of the execution of a condemned man, the State does not dispose of the individual's right to life. In this case it is reserved to the public power to deprive the condemned person of the enjoyment of life in expiation of his crime when, by his crime, he has already disposed himself of his right to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P12PSYCH.HTM|last=His Holiness Pope Pius XII|title=The Moral Limits of Medical Research Treatment: Address to the First International Congress on the Histopathology of the Nervous System|date=14 September 1952|website=Eternal World Television Network|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late twentieth century, however, the [[Catholic Church]] began to generally move away from explicitly condoning the death penalty and instead began to increasingly adopt a more disapproving stance on the issue.&lt;ref name="desmond"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desmond|first1=Joan Frawley|title=‘Botched’ Execution in Oklahoma Marks Church’s Shifting View of Death Penalty|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/botched-execution-in-oklahoma-marks-churchs-shifting-view-of-death-penalty/|website=National Catholic Register|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newrep"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruenig|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Catholic Church Opposes the Death Penalty.

For example, in his 1995 [[Evangelium Vitae]], Pope John Paul II suggested that capital punishment should be avoided unless it is the only way to defend society from the offender in question, opining that punishment "ought not go to the extreme of executing the offender except in cases of absolute necessity: in other words, when it would not be possible otherwise to defend society. Today however, as a result of steady improvements in the organisation of the penal system, such cases are very rare, if not practically non-existent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0141/__PP.HTM Papal encyclical, Evangelium Vitae], March 25, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 edition of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] restated this view, and further stated that:&lt;ref name="mcelwee"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Assuming that the guilty party’s identity and responsibility have been fully determined, the traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor. If, however, non-lethal means are sufficient to defend and protect people’s safety from the aggressor, authority will limit itself to such means, as these are more in keeping with the concrete conditions of the common good and more in conformity to the dignity of the human person.&lt;ref name="desmond"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, that the assessment of the contemporary situation advanced by John Paul II is not binding on the faithful was suggested by Cardinal Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) when he wrote in 2004 that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;if a Catholic were to be at odds with the Holy Father (i.e., the Pope) on the application of capital punishment or on the decision to wage war, he would not for that reason be considered unworthy to present himself to receive Holy Communion. While the Church exhorts civil authorities to seek peace, not war, and to exercise discretion and mercy in imposing punishment on criminals, it may still be permissible to take up arms to repel an aggressor or to have recourse to capital punishment. There may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty, but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bishops/04-07ratzingerommunion.htm|title=Abortion – Pro Life – Cardinal Ratzinger on Voting, Abortion, and Worthiness to Receive Holy Communion|date=July 2004|website=Priests for Life|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some Catholic writers, such as the late Cardinal [[Joseph Bernadin]] of Chicago, have argued against the use of the death penalty in modern times by drawing on a stance labelled the "[[consistent life ethic]]". Characteristic of this approach is an emphasis on the sanctity of human life, and the responsibility on both a personal and social level to protect and preserve life from "[[womb]] to [[tomb]]" ([[fertilisation|conception]] to natural death). This position draws on the conviction that God has "boundless love for every person, regardless of human merit or worthiness."&lt;ref&gt;Bernardin, J. ''Consistent Ethic of Life'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1988), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Catholic writers, such as [[Joseph Sobran]] and Matt Abbott, have criticised this approach, contending that it minimises the issue of abortion by placing it on the same level as the death penalty – the latter of which the Church does not consider intrinsically immoral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/abbott/090518|last=Abbott|first=Matt C|title=Obama praised Bernardin – go figure|date=18 May 2009|website=RenewAmerica|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sobran.com/columns/2005/050816.shtml|last=Sobran|first=Joseph|title=The "Seamless Garment" Revisited|date=16 August 2005|website=Sobran's|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Pope Francis]] stated in an address to the [[International Commission Against the Death Penalty|International Commission against the Death Penalty]] that: "Today the death penalty is inadmissible, no matter how serious the crime committed." Francis argued that the death penalty is no longer justified by a society's need to defend itself and has lost all legitimacy due to the possibility of [[Wrongful execution|judicial error]]. He further stated that capital punishment is an offense "against the inviolability of life and the dignity of the human person, which contradicts God's plan for man and society" and "does not render justice to the victims, but rather fosters vengeance." &lt;ref name="gibson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=David|title=Pope Francis takes a dim view of the death penalty, but not all Catholics are convinced|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/politics/pope-francis-takes-dim-view-death-penalty-not-all-catholics-are-convinced|website=National Catholic Register|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the address, Francis further explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In certain circumstances, when hostilities are underway, a measured reaction is necessary in order to prevent the aggressor from causing harm, and the need to neutralize the aggressor may result in his elimination; it is a case of legitimate defence (cf. Evangelium Vitae, n. 55). Nevertheless, the prerequisites of legitimate personal defence are not applicable in the social sphere without the risk of distortion. In fact, when the death penalty is applied, people are killed not for current acts of aggression, but for offences committed in the past. Moreover, it is applied to people whose capacity to cause harm is not current, but has already been neutralized, and who are deprived of their freedom. [...]

For a constitutional State the death penalty represents a failure, because it obliges the State to kill in the name of justice [...] Justice is never reached by killing a human being. [...] The death penalty loses all legitimacy due to the defective selectivity of the criminal justice system and in the face of the possibility of judicial error. Human justice is imperfect, and the failure to recognize its fallibility can transform it into a source of injustice. With the application of capital punishment, the person sentenced is denied the possibility to make amends or to repent of the harm done; the possibility of [[Sacrament of Penance|confession]], with which man expresses his inner conversion; and of [[contrition]], the means of [[Repentance (Christianity)|repentance]] and atonement, in order to reach the encounter with the merciful and healing love of God. Furthermore, capital punishment is a frequent practice to which [[totalitarian]] regimes and fanatical groups resort, for the extermination of political dissidents, minorities, and every individual labelled as “dangerous” or who might be perceived as a threat to their power or to the attainment of their objectives. As in the first centuries and also in the current one, the Church suffers from the application of this penalty to her new martyrs.

The death penalty is contrary to the meaning of ''[[humanitas]]'' and to divine [[mercy]], which must be models for human justice. It entails cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, as is the anguish before the moment of execution and the terrible suspense between the issuing of the sentence and the execution of the penalty, a form of “torture” which, in the name of correct procedure, tends to last many years, and which oftentimes leads to illness and insanity on death row.&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web|title=LETTER OF HIS HOLINESS POPE FRANCIS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/letters/2015/documents/papa-francesco_20150320_lettera-pena-morte.html|website=Vatican}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shortly prior to Francis's address, the Vatican had officially given support to a 2015 [[United Nations]] campaign against the death penalty.&lt;ref name="gibson"/&gt; During a U.N. Human Rights Council meeting concerning the abolishment of capital punishment, [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Archbishop]] [[Silvano Tomasi]] declared that "The [[Holy See]] Delegation fully supports the efforts to abolish the use of the death penalty."&lt;ref name="mcelwee"/&gt; The Archbishop stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Considering the practical circumstances found in most States ... it appears evident nowadays that means other than the death penalty 'are sufficient to defend human lives against an aggressor and to protect public order and the safety of persons [...] We should take into account that no clear positive effect of deterrence results from the application of the death penalty and that the irreversibility of this punishment does not allow for eventual corrections in the case of wrongful convictions.&lt;ref name="mcelwee"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McElwee|first1=Joshua J.|title=Vatican 'fully supports' global abolition of death penalty|url=https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/vatican-fully-supports-global-abolition-death-penalty?_ga=1.157100018.812902852.1467565768|website=National Catholic Register|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On August 2, 2018, Pope Francis changed Catechism of the Catholic Church 2267 to the following:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2018-08/pope-francis-cdf-ccc-death-penalty-revision-ladaria.html News.Va: Pope Francis: ‘death penalty inadmissable’ ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/world/europe/pope-death-penalty.html|title=Pope Declares Death Penalty Inadmissible in All Cases|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Recourse to the death penalty on the part of legitimate authority, following a fair trial, was long considered an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good.

:Today, however, there is an increasing awareness that the dignity of the person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes.  In addition, a new understanding has emerged of the significance of penal sanctions imposed by the state.  Lastly, more effective systems of detention have been developed, which ensure the due protection of citizens but, at the same time, do not definitively deprive the guilty of the possibility of redemption.

:Consequently, the Church teaches, in the light of the Gospel, that “the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person”, and she works with determination for its abolition worldwide”.

===Orthodox===
Various Orthodox churches have issued statements opposing capital punishment, including the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Orthodox Church in America, the Greek Orthodox Church, and the Georgian Orthodox Church.&lt;ref&gt;"Orthodoxy and Capital Punishment." 2008. In {{cite web|title=Communion|url= http://incommunion.org/2008/02/24/orthodoxy-and-capital-punishment/|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglican and Episcopalian===

Article 37 of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] states that

{{quote|The Laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with death, for heinous and grievous offences.}}

The [[Lambeth Conference]] of Anglican and Episcopalian bishops condemned the death penalty in 1988:
{{quote|This Conference: ... 3. Urges the Church to speak out against: ... (b) all governments who practise capital punishment, and encourages them to find alternative ways of sentencing offenders so that the divine dignity of every human being is respected and yet justice is pursued;....&lt;ref&gt;Lambeth Conference of Anglican Bishops, 1988, Resolution 33, paragraph 3. (b), found at [http://www.lambethconference.org/resolutions/1988/1988-33.cfm Lambeth Conference official website page]. Accessed July 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before that date, Anglican Bishops in the House of Lords had tended to vote in favour of the retention of capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Harry ''Hanging In Judgement'', London, SCM Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Southern Baptist Convention===
In 2000 the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] updated [[Baptist Faith and Message]]. In it the convention officially sanctioned the use of capital punishment by the State. It said that it is the duty of the state to execute those guilty of murder and that God established capital punishment in the [[Noahic Covenant]] (Genesis 9:6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=299 |last=Southern Baptist Convention |title=SBC Resolutions: On Capital Punishment |date=June 2000 |accessdate=27 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720165331/http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=299 |archivedate=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Protestants===
Several key leaders early in the [[Protestant Reformation]], including [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]], followed the traditional reasoning in favour of capital punishment, and the [[Lutheran Church]]'s [[Augsburg Confession]] explicitly defended it. Some Protestant groups have cited [[s:Bible (World English)/Genesis#Chapter 9|Genesis 9:5–6]], [[s:Bible (World English)/Romans#Chapter 13|Romans 13:3–4]], and
[[s:Bible (World English)/Leviticus#Chapter 20|Leviticus 20:1–27]] as the basis for permitting the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equip.org/free/CP1303.htm |last=Christian Research Institute |title=Statement: CP1303: Capital Punishment |location=Charlotte, North Carolina |accessdate=27 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207020406/http://www.equip.org/free/CP1303.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some verses can be cited where Jesus seems to be a legalist by advocating respect for religious and civil laws: [[s:Bible (World English)/Matthew#Chapter 5|Matthew 5:17-22]], [[s:Bible (World English)/Matthew#Chapter 22|22:17-21]] (the famous phrase ″Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's″, separating religion and civil law) and [[s:Bible (World English)/John#Chapter 8|John 8:10-11]].

[[Mennonites]], [[Church of the Brethren]] and [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] have opposed the death penalty since their founding, and continue to be strongly opposed to it today. These groups, along with other Christians opposed to capital punishment, have cited [[Christ]]'s [[Sermon on the Mount]] (transcribed in [[s:Bible (World English)/Matthew#Chapter 5|Matthew Chapter 5–7]]) and [[Sermon on the Plain]] (transcribed in [[s:Bible (World English)/Luke#Chapter 6|Luke 6:17–49]]). In both sermons, Christ tells his followers to [[turn the other cheek]] and to love their enemies, which these groups believe mandates [[nonviolence]], including opposition to the death penalty.

===Mormonism===
{{Main|Mormonism and violence|blood atonement|Capital punishment in Utah}}{{more footnotes|date=August 2018}}[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) presently takes no position on capital punishment. There are statements from church officials on [[blood atonement]].  This belief held that the blood of [[Jesus]]' [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]] could not remit certain serious sins, and that the only way a Mormon sinner could pay for committing such sins would be to have his own blood spilled on the ground as an [[atonement in Judaism|atonement]]. This doctrine was never held by the church or practised by clergy in their official capacity. The doctrine has no relation as to the reason why, until recently, [[Utah]] gave convicts sentenced to death a choice to be [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] rather than other methods such as [[lethal injection]].&lt;ref name="SLT-20100521"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/lifestyle/49621318-80/blood-atonement-firing-squad.html.csp|title=Gardner's date with firing squad revives talk of Mormon blood atonement|last=Stack|first=Peggy Fletcher|authorlink=Peggy Fletcher Stack|accessdate=2010-06-18|date=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night before the execution of [[Ronnie Lee Gardner]], who chose to die by firing squad for this reason, the LDS Church released a statement that it did not support blood atonement of individuals as a doctrine of salvation.&lt;ref name="Deseret-20100617-atonement"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|author=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700041267/Mormon-church-statement-on-blood-atonement.html|title=Mormon church statement on blood atonement|accessdate=2010-09-25|date=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence in support of the death penalty===

Historically,The Laws of Manu, or [[manusmriti]], state that the king should be the one to decide on appropriate punishments. The king has the right to do whatever needs to be done in order to protect his people.&lt;ref name="Laws of Manu - The kings"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buhler|first1=Georg|title=The Laws of Manu|date=1964|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=220, 221}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is given the right to punish criminals by placing them in shackles, imprisoning them, or sentencing them to death.&lt;ref name="Laws of Manu - Theft"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buhler|first1=Georg|title=The Laws of Manu|date=1964|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Delhi|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was observed in the 5th century that death sentences were related to [[caste]]. For example, If a [[Shudra|Sudra]] insulted a [[priest]] they were sentenced to death but if a priest were to kill a sudra it was the equivalent of killing a dog or a cat and their only punishment would be to pay a fine.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt; Other crimes worthy of capital or corporal punishment, according to the Laws of Manu, include when a lower caste man makes love to a woman of the highest caste, a Sudra slandering a [[Kshatriya]], when men and women of the most noble family are stolen from, and when a women is violated without consent.&lt;ref name="The Laws of Manu - civil and criminal law"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buhler|first1=Georg|title=The Law of Manu|date=1964|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Delhi|pages=253–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a history of rulers who favored capital punishment, Ashoka is the only known ruler to openly oppose its use.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt; The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Invasion in 16th century marked the end of Ashoka's rule and the reintroduction of the death penalty by subsequent rulers.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt; In the 1980s [[parliament]] expanded punishment by death to offenses such as terrorism and kidnapping for ransom. This decision was supported by the public and a survey conducted in the 1980s solidified this support in finding that teachers, doctors, and lawyers all favored the death penalty.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt; Currently, the [[Indian Penal Code]] (IPC) recognizes legitimacy of the death penalty in cases of murder, waging war against the government, encouraging suicide, fabricating false evidence, kidnapping, and murder as part of a robbery.&lt;ref name="Cultural lives....India"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarat|first1=Austin|title=The Cultural Lives of Capital Punishment|date=2005|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|isbn=978-0-804-75233-6|pages=195–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, It is common to find people in support of the death penalty such as [[Kiran Bedi]], Police Advisor to the [[UN]], who says that "the death penalty is necessary in certain cases to do justice to society's anger against the crime."&lt;ref name="Cultural lives....India" /&gt; An example of recent capital punishment in India includes Mohammad Afzal Guru, who was sentenced to death in 2013 after attacking the Indian Parliament in December 2001.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt;

===Evidence opposing the death penalty===

Emperor Ashoka, who ruled during what is called "the golden age" of Hinduism, was one of the first rulers to completely outlaw the use of capital punishment. This was because of his large emphasis on ahimsa, or nonviolence.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt; In Hinduism, the concept of ahimsa bans the killing of any living being, no matter how small. Many people who oppose the death penalty go back to the beliefs of their enlightened [[ancestors]] who preached non-violence and that we should respect human rights and the gift of life.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt;[[Gandhi]] also opposed the death penalty and stated that "I cannot in all conscience agree to anyone being sent to the gallows. God alone can take life because he alone gives it.&lt;ref name="The next frontier" /&gt; In 1980, the [[Indian Supreme Court]] made it very clear that it does not take capital punishment lightly and as a result of Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab ruled that the death penalty should only be utilized in the "rarest of rare cases."&lt;ref name="death penalty among college students" /&gt; Currently, it is mainly only human rights activists that take a stand against the death penalty. This is because they believe that the only people being sentenced to death are "the poor, the sick, and the ignorant."&lt;ref name="Cultural lives....India" /&gt; Also vulnerable are the non-Hindu [[minorities]], who feel threatened by the idea of the death penalty and oppose it&lt;ref name="death penalty among college students"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lambert|first1=Eric|title=Views on the death penalty among college students in India|journal=Punishment &amp; Society|date=April 1, 2008|volume=10|issue=2|pages=207–218|doi=10.1177/1462474507087199|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1462474507087199|accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is unclear whether a sample of Indian college students is representative of the whole population, Lambert found that when asked their opinion of the death penalty 44% of college students opposed it.&lt;ref name="death penalty among college students" /&gt; However, when taking into account the importance of religion in their lives there was a significant relationship between religious affiliation and support for the death penalty.&lt;ref name="death penalty among college students" /&gt;

Islamic governments are in support of capital punishment.&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; Many Islamic nations have governments run directly by the code of Sharia law&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; and, therefore, Islam is the only known religion to have a direct impact on governmental policies on capital punishment in modern times.&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; Islamic law is often used in the court system of many Islamic countries where there is not [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; The Quran is viewed as the direct word of Allah and going against its teachings is seen as going against the whole basis of the law.&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; Islamic law states "Do not kill a soul which [[Allah]] has made sacred except through the process of due law," meaning that the death penalty is allowed in certain cases where the law says it is necessary.&lt;ref name="Schabas - Islam and the Death Penalty" /&gt; The Quran explicitly states that the taking of a life results in the taking of ones own. According to the Quran, the death penalty is recognized for some of the "[[Hudud]]" crimes in Islam because it is believed that these acts go directly against the word of god and are seen as a threat to society.&lt;ref name="Cross National capital Punishment"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miethe|first1=Terance|title=Cross National Variability in Capital Punishment|journal=International Criminal Justice Review|date=November 1, 2005|volume=15|issue=2|pages=115–130|doi=10.1177/1057567705283954|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1057567705283954|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in pre-modern Islam capital punishment for these crimes were rarely enforced because the evidentiary standards were so high as to make conviction more difficult.&lt;ref name=hallaq-intro-173&gt;[[Wael Hallaq]] (2009), ''An introduction to Islamic law'', p.173. [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|9780521678735}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peters-OEIW&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Rudolph Peters|title=Hudud|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0322}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enforcement of these laws by modern Islamic governments has been a source of minor controversy within Muslim communities at times.

===Islamic nations===

Islamic nations generally agree upon the retention of the death penalty but differ in how they impose it, indicating that there is still disagreement on the issue even within the religion of Islam. [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], for example, are very open about using the death penalty frequently, whereas the Islamic nation of [[Tunisia]] only uses it in extremely rare cases. [[Sudan]] will impose the death penalty for those under the age of eighteen, while [[Yemen]] has taken a stance against using the death penalty for minors.&lt;ref name="Schabas - Islam and the Death Penalty"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schabas|first1=William|title=Islam and the Death Penalty|journal=William and Mary Bill of Rights Journal|date=December 2000|volume=9|issue=1|pages=223–236|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/wmbrts9&amp;div=18&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=&amp;collection=journals#|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptionally, [[Djibouti]] is an Islamic nation which prohibits the death penalty in all situations.

The [[UN]] has voiced concern about the sudden increase in death sentences in Iran since 2014. Although Iran has been called upon multiple times to stop utilizing the death penalty so frequently, a total of 625 executions were carried out in 2013 alone. Many of these executions consisted of drug related crimes, "enmity against god", and threatening national security.&lt;ref name="UN Islam Hangings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop the Executions - UN rights experts alarmed at the sharp increase in hangings in Iran|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14190&amp;|website=United Nations Human Rights|publisher=OHCHR|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a controversial case, Iranian woman [[Reyhaneh Jabbari]] was hanged in [[Tehran]] in October 2014 for the murder of a man she claimed attempted to rape her. Her sentence was supported by the concept of [[qisas]] found in the Quran.&lt;ref name="Iran Woman Hanging"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mehrdad|first1=Balali|title=Iran Hangs Women Convicted of Killing Alleged Rapist|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/25/iran-woman-hanged-for-killing-rapist_n_6046350.html|website=Huffington Post|publisher=Erggruen Institute|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term qisas is translated as "equality in retaliation," meaning that any injury inflicted on another should be compensated for by punishing the perpetrator with the same injury.&lt;ref name="Qisas Law"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tahir|first1=Wasti|title=Islamic law in practice: The Application of Qisas and Diyat Law in Pakistan|journal=Yearbook of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law|date=2007|volume=13|pages=97–106|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/yislamie13&amp;div=11&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=&amp;collection=journals#|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatwas and Jihad===

A [[fatwa]] is translated as a legal ruling that is issued by an Islamic legal expert&lt;ref name="Fatwas"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kabbani|first1=Shaykh|title=What is a Fatwa?|url=http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/understanding-islam/legal-rulings/44-what-is-a-fatwa.html|website=The Islamic Supreme Council of America|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that addresses the allowance or prohibition of a certain act.&lt;ref name="Fatwa Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bar|first1=Shmuel|title=Warrant for Terror: Fatwas of Radical Islam and the Duty of Jihad|date=2006|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-5120-6|pages=1–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatwas promoting violence, in which the government allows an individual or a group of people to kill, is found only in Islam.&lt;ref name="Greenberg - Siting the Death Penalty Internationally" /&gt; Some fatwas are based on [[jihad]], defined by radicals as a military conflict that is generally an individual duty for all healthy adult males. This idea becomes relevant in military struggles between Muslims and non-believers in which Muslims are not permitted to flee. The necessity to fight is viewed as an act of faith to Allah and those that remain loyal will be rewarded. Ancient Islamic law lays out conditions under which jihads can be waged and around 10-14 out of the 36 total conditions are military related. Other forms of jihad include personal struggles with the evil implications of ones soul or wealth. Current military motivations might be coming from the idea that Islam can only be spread through violence although the modern world includes methods such as mass media and the internet&lt;ref name="Fatwa Book" /&gt;

Traditionally, fatwas must identify the legal problem being addressed, consider other rulings regarding the issue, and lay out a clear guide on how to solve the problem. Fatwas need to be based on many sources such as the Qur'an, the [[sunnah]], logical analogies, public interest, and necessity. There has been question about a Muslim following a fatwa that causes him to sin, particularly in cases of violence. This falls back on the [[cleric]] that issued to fatwa and the person that committed the potential crime. This has led to radical interpretations of legitimacy of killing in order to fulfill a fatwa. An example of this include Islamic terrorism which states that "the meaning of jihad is to strive to liberate Muslim lands of the grip of [[kuffar]] who usurped them and imposed on them their own laws instead of the laws of Allah."&lt;ref name="Fatwa Book" /&gt; Fatwas have been issued by radicals of the Muslim community against the west with claims of heresy and world domination. An example of this is the fatwa issued by Sheikh Abdallah 'Azzam who called for an on going jihad "until all of mankind worships Allah." This resulted in a fatwa that encouraged killing all non-believers was the responsibility of all Muslims as a response to the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.&lt;ref name="Fatwa Book" /&gt; Another example includes when Well known Islamic religious leader, [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], issued a fatwa in February 2011 against Libyan dictator [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. He stated that "whoever in the Libyan army is able to shoot a bullet at Mr Gaddafi should do so," on [[Al-Jazeera]] television.&lt;ref name="Gaddafi Fatwa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Besta|first1=Shankar|title=Muslim Cleric issues fatwa to kill Gaddafi|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/muslim-cleric-issues-fatwa-kill-gaddafi-269413|website=International Business Times|publisher=Newsweek Media Group|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Judaism and Christianity]] --&gt;
{{Main|Capital and corporal punishment (Judaism)|Judaism and violence}}
{{See also|List of capital crimes in the Torah}}

The official teachings of [[Judaism]] approve the death penalty in principle but the standard of proof required for application of death penalty is extremely stringent, and in practice, it has been abolished by various Talmudic decisions, making the situations in which a death sentence could be passed effectively impossible and hypothetical. "Forty years before the destruction" of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE, i.e. in 30 CE, the [[Sanhedrin]] effectively abolished capital punishment, making it a hypothetical upper limit on the severity of punishment, fitting in finality for God alone to use, not fallible humans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] (Sanhedrin 41 a).&lt;/ref&gt;

While allowing for the death penalty in some hypothetical circumstances, scholars of [[Judaism]] are broadly opposed to the death penalty as practised in the modern world. The Jewish understanding of Biblical law is not based on a literal reading of the Bible, but rather through the lens of Judaism's [[oral law]]. These oral laws were first recorded around 200 CE in the [[Mishnah]] and later around 600 CE in the Babylonian [[Talmud]]. The laws make it clear that the death penalty was used only rarely. The Mishnah states:
:A [[Sanhedrin]] that puts a man to death once in seven years is called destructive. Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah says: a Sanhedrin that puts a man to death even once in seventy years. Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Tarfon say: Had we been in the Sanhedrin none would ever have been put to death. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: they would have multiplied shedders of blood in Israel. (Mishnah, Makkot 1:10).

Rabbinic tradition describes a detailed system of checks and balances to prevent the execution of an innocent person. These rules are so restrictive as to effectively legislate the penalty out of existence. The law requires that:

*There must have been two witnesses to the crime, and these must conform to a prescribed list of criteria. For example, females and close relatives of the criminal are precluded from being witnesses according to Biblical law, while full-time gamblers are precluded as a matter of rabbinical law.
*The witnesses must have verbally warned the person seconds before the act that they were liable for the death penalty
*The person must then have verbally acknowledged that he or she was warned and that the warning would be disregarded, and then have gone ahead and committed the sin.
*No individual was allowed to testify against him or herself.

The 12th-century Jewish legal scholar [[Maimonides]] famously stated that "It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death."&lt;ref name="Goldstein(Rabbi.)2006"&gt;{{cite book

Maimonides was concerned about the need for the law to guard itself in public perceptions, to preserve its majesty and retain the people's respect.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269–271 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he allowed for the possibility of imposing capital punishment on circumstantial evidence alone when warranted&lt;ref&gt;Guide to the Perplexed pt. 3 ch. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the [[Israel|State of Israel]] only uses the death penalty for extraordinary crimes, and only two people have ever been executed in Israel's history{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}. The only civil execution ever to take place in Israel was of convicted [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[War crime|war criminal]] [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1962. The other execution was of [[Meir Tobianski]], an army major court-martialled and convicted of treason during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], and posthumously exonerated. However, Israeli employment of the death penalty has little to do with Jewish law.

In [[Orthodox Judaism]] it is held that in theory the death penalty is a correct and just punishment for some crimes. However, in practice the application of such a punishment can only be carried out by humans whose system of justice is nearly perfect, a situation which has not existed for some time.

Orthodox [[Rabbi]] Yosef Edelstein writes
:"So, at least theoretically, the Torah can be said to be pro-capital punishment.  It is not morally wrong, in absolute terms, to put a murderer to death ...However, things look rather different when we turn our attention to the practical realisation of this seemingly harsh legislation. You may be aware that it was exceedingly difficult, in practice, to carry out the death penalty in Jewish society ...I think it's clear that with regard to Jewish jurisprudence, the capital punishment outlined by the Written and Oral Torah, and as carried out by the greatest Sages from among our people (who were paragons of humility and humanity and not just scholarship, needless to say), did not remotely resemble the death penalty in modern America (or Texas). In theory, capital punishment is kosher; it's morally right, in the Torah's eyes. But we have seen that there was great concern—expressed both in the legislation of the Torah, and in the sentiments of some of our great Sages—regarding its practical implementation. It was carried out in ancient Israel, but only with great difficulty. Once in seven years; not 135 in five and a half." ([[Yosef Edelstein|Rabbi Yosef Edelstein]], Director of the Savannah Kollel)

Orthodox Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]] writes:
:"In practice, however, these punishments were almost never invoked, and existed mainly as a deterrent and to indicate the seriousness of the sins for which they were prescribed. The rules of evidence and other safeguards that the Torah provides to protect the accused made it all but impossible to actually invoke these penalties...the system of judicial punishments could become brutal and barbaric unless administered in an atmosphere of the highest morality and piety. When these standards declined among the Jewish people, the Sanhedrin...voluntarily abolished this system of penalties" ([[Aryeh Kaplan|Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan]] in ''Handbook of Jewish Thought'', Volume II, pp. 170–71).

On the other hand, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, in a letter to then New York Governor Hugh Carey&lt;ref&gt;Responsa Iggerot Moshe, Choshen Mishpat v. 2 responsum 68.&lt;/ref&gt; states:
"One who murders because the prohibition to kill is meaningless to him and he is especially cruel, and so too when murderers and evil people proliferate they [the courts] would [should?] judge [capital punishment] to repair the issue [and] to prevent murder – for this [action of the court] saves the state."

In [[Conservative Judaism]] the death penalty was the subject of a [[responsa|responsum]] by its [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]]:
:"The Talmud ruled out the admissibility of circumstantial evidence in cases which involved a capital crime. Two witnesses were required to testify that they saw the action with their own eyes. A man could not be found guilty of a capital crime through his own confession or through the testimony of immediate members of his family. The rabbis demanded a condition of cool premeditation in the act of crime before they would sanction the death penalty; the specific test on which they insisted was that the criminal be warned prior to the crime, and that the criminal indicate by responding to the warning, that he is fully aware of his deed, but that he is determined to go through with it. In effect this did away with the application of the death penalty. The rabbis were aware of this, and they declared openly that they found capital punishment repugnant to them... There is another reason which argues for the abolition of capital punishment. It is the fact of human fallibility. Too often we learn of people who were convicted of crimes and only later are new facts uncovered by which their innocence is established. The doors of the jail can be opened, in such cases we can partially undo the injustice. But the dead cannot be brought back to life again. We regard all forms of capital punishment as barbaric and obsolete..."&lt;ref&gt;
Rabbi [[Ben Zion Bokser]], Statement on capital punishment, 1960. ''Proceedings of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards 1927–1970'', Volume III, pp.&amp;nbsp;1537–1538.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:New Brunswick, Canada.svg|thumb|right|The [[provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[New Brunswick]] (red), where section 16.1 applies.]]
'''Section 16.1''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' is the newest section of the Charter.  It was enacted by the '''''Constitution Amendment, 1993 (New Brunswick)''''' and guarantees [[social equality|equality]] between [[English language|English]]-speaking and [[French language|French]]-speaking [[New Brunswick]]ers.

Section 16.1 (pronounced "sixteen point one") is not to be confused with subsection 16(1) ("sixteen one"), which is part of [[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 16]] and goes back to 1982.  Section 16.1 is a separate section;&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada.'' 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), p. 1214&lt;/ref&gt; the "point one" numbering simply indicates that at some time (i.e. in 1993) an amendment inserted this new section between two existing sections without renumbering them.

==Text==
The section reads,

{{cquote|16.1 (1)  The English linguistic community and the French linguistic community in New Brunswick have equality of status and equal rights and privileges, including the right to distinct educational institutions and such distinct cultural institutions as are necessary for the preservation and promotion of those communities.

(2)  The role of the legislature and government of New Brunswick to preserve and promote the status, rights and privileges referred to subsection (1) is affirmed.}}

==Purpose==
Section 16.1 makes reference to a need for ''[[institutions]]'' for both [[language]] groups, including [[education in Canada|educational]] institutions, and it seemingly gives the provincial government powers to protect the right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deborah Coyne]], "New Brunswick amendment has fundamental flaw," ''The Gazette'', Montreal, Quebec: January 13, 1993. pg. B.3.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not completely revolutionary in that this merely entrenches laws already found in ''[[Bill 88|An Act Recognizing the Equality of the Two Official Linguistic Communities in New Brunswick]]'' (1981), as noted in the 2001 [[Court of Appeal of New Brunswick|Court of Appeal]] case ''Charlebois v. Mowat''.  The section can be seen as providing "[[collective rights]]," and one critic charged that a deeper meaning to the section would have to be decided by Canadian courts.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;William Johnson, "Unseemly haste to amend constitution without debate," ''The Hamilton Spectator''. Hamilton, Ontario: February 4, 1993. pg. A.7&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Charlebois v. Mowat'', the court ruled that section 16.1, as well as subsections 16(2) and [[Section Eighteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|18(2)]], require bilingual [[municipal]] laws when the minority language population of a municipality is significant.  The ruling was made primarily on the basis of the court's interpretation of subsection 18(2)), but in its ruling the court also stated that section 16.1 is "remedial", meaning that it is supposed to fix historical problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canlii.ca/nb/cas/nbca/2001/2001nbca117.html CanLII - 2001 NBCA 117 (CanLII)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  (A related case later went to the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] as ''[[Charlebois v. Saint John (City)]]''.)

==History==
''An Act Recognizing the Equality of the Two Official Linguistic Communities in New Brunswick''&lt;ref&gt;originally SNB 1981, c O-1.1&lt;/ref&gt; was enacted in 1981 by Premier [[Richard Hatfield]]. It provided independent [[school board]]s for both linguistic groups.  Its principles were later incorporated into the [[Constitution of Canada]], through section 16.1, in response to a shift in provincial politics in the early 1990s.

Whereas in the 1980s all parties had supported the rise of bilingualism in New Brunswick, in 1991 a new party called the [[New Brunswick Confederation of Regions Party|Confederation of Regions Party]], which was opposed to official bilingualism, became the [[official opposition]] in the legislature.  The pro-bilingualism Liberal provincial government proceeded to seek a constitutional amendment mandating bilingualism in New Brunswick to make any future change in New Brunswick's status subject to Federal approval.&lt;ref&gt;Dyck, Rand.  ''Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches.'' Third ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson Thomson Learning, 2000), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitutionalization of the legislation was originally meant to be accomplished as part of a package of amendments known as the [[Charlottetown Accord]] in 1992.  The amendment was made separately once the Accord was rejected in a national referendum, prompting Professor Peter Russell to refer to this as an "encouraging [sign] that Canadians may be recovering the capacity to accomplish constitutional reform without linking everything together and getting bogged down in the mega constitutional swamp."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Peter.  ''Constitutional Odyssey,'' 2nd ed. (Toronto:  University of Toronto Press, 1993), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 43 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' was the part of the [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|amending formula]] used to add section 16.1 to the ''Charter''.  This meant the amendment was approved by the province affected (New Brunswick) and the [[Senate of Canada]] and [[House of Commons of Canada]], although constitutional lawyer [[Deborah Coyne]] argued that the amendment involved federal jurisdiction and thus seven provinces would be needed.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;  The House of Commons passed the amendment with a vote of 219-2, on February 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.HOC_3403_132_03/485?r=0&amp;s=1&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' article approved, calling the New Brunswick government "courageous" because of its resistance to the Confederation of Regions Party, and added that the section provided a "noble, generous vision of Canadian duality and co-existence. Too bad it seems confined to New Brunswick."&lt;ref&gt;"New Brunswick leads the way," ''The Gazette''. Montreal, Quebec: December 4, 1992. pg. B.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

It did attract some criticism, with columnist William Johnson claiming that Parliament had not fully analyzed the amendment and tried to stifle public discussion.  He even suggested that section 16.1 might create two governments for New Brunswick, one in English and one in French.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;  Earlier, this columnist had also charged that enshrining collective rights in the Constitution was "alien to [[liberalism]]," and would undermine the individual in favour of a larger group; he also said section 16.1 excluded [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples in New Brunswick]] and could make them "[[second-class citizen]]s." He compared section 16.1 to how the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and Charlottetown Accord would have recognized Quebec as a [[distinct society]].&lt;ref&gt;William Johnson, "New Brunswick amendment tramples individual rights," ''The Gazette''. Montreal, Quebec: January 16, 1993. pg. B.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Opposition leader [[Jean Chrétien]], who at that time represented [[Acadian]]s, said that "For me it is a great day. It is an example that we can be together and at the same time be different in Canada."&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

===Proclamation===

The ''Constitution Amendment, 1993 (New Brunswick)'' was signed by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]], [[Attorney General of Canada|Attorney General]] [[Pierre Blais]], and [[Registrar General of Canada|Registrar General]] [[Pierre H. Vincent]], under a proclamation of [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Ray Hnatyshyn]] in [[Ottawa]] on 12 March 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2014/lois-statutes/YX2-1993-1.pdf publications.gc.ca: "Constitution Amendment, 1993 (New Brunswick)"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/cap_1993nba.html solon.org: "Constitution Amendment Proclamation, 1993 (New Brunswick Act)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence outside New Brunswick==
[[Image:Montfort hospital.JPG|thumb|right|[[Montfort Hospital]].]]
In 2000, an [[Ontario]] court ruled that the province was legally obligated to keep from closing the [[Montfort Hospital]] as part of its program of merging many of the [[Ottawa Hospital|hospitals in the Ottawa region]].  The basis for the decision was the court's conclusion that this was a logical application of an unwritten constitutional principle of [[minority rights]], which had been found by the Supreme Court in the 1998 ''[[Reference re Secession of Quebec]]''.  Since the Montfort Hospital was the only hospital in the region operating primarily in French, it amounted to a protected parallel service-provider, much as New Brunswick's French-language and English-language school systems are parallel service providers, and therefore as an essential component of the collective rights of Ottawa's [[Franco-Ontarian]] population. The [[Government of Ontario]] criticized the decision as [[judicial activism]], and charged that "The divisional court decision has effectively rewritten the constitution to make [Section] 16.1 applicable to Ontario despite the express intention that it apply to New Brunswick alone."&lt;ref&gt;Wills, Terrance.  “English will do:  Ontario:  Franco-Ontarians’ plight not our problem:  Harris.”  The Gazette.  Montreal, Quebec:  July 16, 2000, A.1.FRO.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sejm court''' was a [[court]] that sat in cases of [[impeachment]] – in the words of the [[May 3 Constitution]] of 1791 (article VIII:  the judicial authority) – of government "[[Political minister|minister]]s [...] charged with breach of law by a deputation designated to examine their deeds [...]."

The composition and functioning of sejm courts were spelled out in an act of the Sejm passed on May 13, 1791.

'''Sentientism''' is an ethical philosophy that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Linzey|first1=A|title=Sentientism|journal=Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare|date=1998|page=311|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/LINS-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sentientism extends [[humanism]] by showing compassion for non-human animals as well as potential artificial and alien intelligences.  In common with humanism, sentientism rejects supernatural beliefs in favour of critical, evidence-based thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Woodhouse |first1=Jamie |title=Humanism needs an upgrade |url=https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/07/humanism-needs-an-upgrade-the-philosophy-that-could-save-the-world/ |website=Areo |accessdate=21 November 2018|date=2018-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sentientism proposes that sentience, the ability to experience suffering or flourishing, should determine whether we grant moral consideration to an entity&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Sentientism|journal=The Great Ape Project|pages=220–222|date=1993|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/RYDS}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Non-sentient entities do not warrant direct moral consideration because they can not experience the implications of our decisions.

Sentientist thinking has a long history, from [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book
|last = Bentham
|first = Jeremy
|authorlink = 
|title = An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation
|publisher = Methuen
|series =  
|year = 1780
|doi = 
|isbn = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; through to contemporary philosophers such as [[Richard D. Ryder]] and [[Peter Singer]].

Sentientism differs from [[Speciesism]] in that it uses degrees of sentience, rather than species boundaries, to grant degrees of moral consideration.

Sentientism differs from [[painism]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Painism versus utilitarianism|journal=Think|date=2009|volume=8|issue=21|page=85|doi=10.1017/S1477175608000420|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/think/article/painism-versus-utilitarianism/8C7F06412FC4DC9305BAA3D6E5871109}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it acknowledges the full range of experience, not just that of pain, in warranting moral consideration. 

Sentientism agrees with [[Animalism (philosophy)|Animalism]] that humans are animals so both warrant moral consideration. However, sentientism argues that non-animal sentient beings, such as potential artificial or alien intelligences, would also warrant moral consideration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4534">'''Stefanus Alliance International (SAINT)''' is a religious freedom and human rights organization with historical roots in Christian missions work, dedicated to defending freedom of belief and religion as expressed in Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The organization is based in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. Its motto, designated in 1996, is: "Together for the persecuted."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanus.no/no/om_oss/english/Stefanus+Alliance+International.9UFRjYYc.ips|title=Stefanus Alliance International|last=|first=|date=|website=Stefanus Alliance International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

''Stefanus Alliance International'' was established in 1967 by [[Monrad Norderval]], Anutza Moise, Vemund Skard, Else-Marie Skard and Gulbrand Øverbye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanus.no/no/om_oss/kort_historikk/|title=Kort historikk|last=|first=|date=|website=Stefanus Alliance International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was earlier known as the ''Mission Behind the Iron Curtain'', or the ''Norwegian Mission to the East.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://snl.no/Stefanusalliansen|title=Stefanusalliansen|last=|first=|date=|website=Store Norske Leksikon|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization decided at its meeting of October 29, 2011 to change its name to ''Stefanus Alliance International'' as of January 1, 2012. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norsk Misjon i Øst skifter navn|page=12|work=Vårt Land|date=31 October 2011|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

''Stefanus Alliance International'' provides support, care, and practical help for churches and individuals who are persecuted or oppressed because of their religious beliefs. The organisation also advocates on behalf of Christians and others who have had their religious rights violated. It commissioned a radio in 1968, published the newspaper ''Ropet fra Øst'' in 1971, and helped establish [[Forum 18]] news service in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanus.no/no/om_oss/kort_historikk/|title=Kort historikk|last=|first=|date=|website=Stefanus Alliance International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NGO is a partner in the international [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide]] network since 2001.

''Stefanus Alliance International'' awards the [[Stefanus Prize]], a prestigious human rights prize to individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the work for freedom of religion or belief as defined by the Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Despite having historical roots as a Christian missions organization, ''Stefanus Alliance International'' in awarding the [[Stefanus Prize]] has recognized the efforts of individuals across different faiths.

== Leadership ==
The organisation is currently led by secretary-general Hilde Skaar Vollebæk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanus.no/no/nyheter/norge/Gravaas+slutter+som+generalsekret%C3%A6r.b7C_wtfS23.ips|title=Gravaas slutter som generalsekretær|last=|first=|date=2017-07-21|website=Stefanus Alliance International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former secretary generals include Lasse Trædal (1982-1989), John Victor Selle (1989-2002), [[Bjørn Wegge]] (2002-2013) and Hans Aage Gravaas (2013-2017).

The '''Thirteenth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XIII''') to the [[United States Constitution]] abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[involuntary servitude]], except [[Penal labor in the United States|as punishment for a crime]]. In [[United States Congress|Congress]], it was passed by the Senate on April 8, 1864, and by the House on January 31, 1865. The amendment was ratified by the required number of [[U.S. states|states]] on December 6, 1865. On December 18, 1865, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] proclaimed its adoption. It was the first of the three [[Reconstruction Amendments]] adopted following the [[American Civil War]].

Since the [[American Revolution]], states had divided into [[Slave states and free states|states that allowed or states that prohibited slavery]]. Slavery was implicitly permitted in the original Constitution through provisions such as Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, commonly known as the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], which detailed how each slave state's enslaved population would be factored into its total population [[United States Census|count]] for the purposes of [[Apportionment (politics)|apportioning]] seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[Direct tax#U.S. constitutional law sense|direct taxes]] among the states. Though many slaves had been declared free by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]], their post-war status was uncertain. On April 8, 1864, the Senate passed an amendment to abolish slavery. After one unsuccessful vote and extensive legislative maneuvering by the Lincoln administration, the House followed suit on January 31, 1865. The measure was swiftly ratified by nearly all [[Union (American Civil War)|Northern states]], along with a sufficient number of border states up to the death of Lincoln, but approval came with President [[Andrew Johnson]], who encouraged the "reconstructed" Southern states of Alabama, North Carolina and Georgia to agree, which brought the count to 27 states, and caused it to be adopted before the end of 1865.

Though the amendment formally abolished slavery throughout the United States, factors such as [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], white supremacist violence, and selective enforcement of statutes continued to subject some black Americans to involuntary labor, particularly in the South. In contrast to the other Reconstruction Amendments, the Thirteenth Amendment was rarely cited in later case law, but has been used to strike down [[peon]]age and some race-based discrimination as "badges and incidents of slavery." The Thirteenth Amendment applies to the actions of private citizens, while the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]] Amendments apply only to [[state actor]]s. The Thirteenth Amendment also enables Congress to pass laws against [[sex trafficking]] and other modern forms of slavery.

==Slavery in the United States==
{{Main article|Slavery in the United States}}
[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|Abolitionist imagery focused on atrocities against slaves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth M. Stampp|title=The Imperiled Union:Essays on the Background of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6I87GxnOBEC&amp;pg=PA85|year=1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=85|isbn=9780199878529}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1863 photo of [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]])]]

Slavery existed in all of the original thirteen British North [[Thirteen Colonies#Slaves|American colonies]]. Prior to the Thirteenth Amendment, the [[United States Constitution]] did not expressly use the words ''slave'' or ''slavery'' but included several provisions about unfree persons. The [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution, allocated Congressional representation based "on the whole Number of free Persons" and "three fifths of all other Persons". This clause was a compromise between Southerners who wished slaves to be counted as 'persons' for congressional representation and northerners rejecting these out of concern of too much power for the South, because representation in the new Congress would be based on population in contrast to the one-vote-for-one-state principle in the earlier [[Continental Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Allain|title=The Legal Understanding of Slavery: From the Historical to the Contemporary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_KAvAjkEbsC&amp;pg=PA117|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=117|isbn=9780199660469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3, "No person held to Service or Labour in one State" would be freed by escaping to another. [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Article I, Section 9, Clause 1]] allowed Congress to pass legislation outlawing the "Importation of Persons", but not until 1808. However, for purposes of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]—which states that, "No person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"—slaves were understood as property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Allain|title=The Legal Understanding of Slavery: From the Historical to the Contemporary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_KAvAjkEbsC&amp;pg=PA119|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=119–120|isbn=9780199660469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although abolitionists used the Fifth Amendment to argue against slavery, it became part of the legal basis in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857) for treating slaves as property.&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stimulated by the philosophy of the Declaration of Independence, between 1777 and 1804 every Northern state provided for the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery.  Most of the slaves involved were household servants. No Southern state did so, and the slave population of the South continued to grow, peaking at almost 4 million people in 1861. An [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] headed by such figures as [[William Lloyd Garrison]] grew in strength in the North, calling for the end of slavery nationwide and exacerbating tensions between North and South. The [[American Colonization Society]], an alliance between abolitionists who felt the races should be kept separated and slaveholders who feared the presence of freed blacks would encourage slave rebellions, called for the emigration and colonization of both free blacks and slaves to Africa. Its views were endorsed by politicians such as [[Henry Clay]], who feared that the main abolitionist movement would provoke a civil war.&lt;ref name="Foner—2010——20&amp;amp;ndash;22"&gt;[[#CITEREFFoner2010|Foner, 2010]], pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals to eliminate slavery by constitutional amendment were introduced by Representative [[Arthur Livermore]] in 1818 and by [[John Quincy Adams]] in 1839, but failed to gain significant traction.&lt;ref name="Vile"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2003|title=Thirteenth Amendment|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Constitutional Amendments, Proposed Amendments, and Amending Issues: 1789–2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|editor-first=John R.|editor-last=Vile|pages=449–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the country continued to expand, the issue of slavery in its new territories became the dominant national issue. The Southern position was that slaves were property and therefore could be moved to the territories like all other forms of property.&lt;ref name="Goodwin—2005——123"&gt;[[#CITEREFGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; The 1820 [[Missouri Compromise]] provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, preserving the Senate's [[Slave and free states|equality between the regions]]. In 1846, the [[Wilmot Proviso]] was introduced to a war appropriations bill to ban slavery in all territories acquired in the [[Mexican–American War]]; the Proviso repeatedly passed the House, but not the Senate.&lt;ref name="Goodwin—2005——123"/&gt; The [[Compromise of 1850]] temporarily defused the issue by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and allowing New Mexico and Utah self-determination on the slavery issue.&lt;ref name="Foner—2010——59"&gt;[[#CITEREFFoner2010|Foner, 2010]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the compromise, tensions between North and South continued to rise over the subsequent decade, inflamed by, amongst other things, the publication of the 1852 anti-slavery novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'';  [[Bleeding Kansas|fighting between pro-slavery and abolitionist forces]] in Kansas, beginning in 1854; the 1857 ''Dred Scott'' decision, which struck down provisions of the Compromise of 1850; abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown's]] 1859 attempt to start a slave revolt at [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|Harpers Ferry]] and the 1860 election of slavery critic [[Abraham Lincoln]] to the presidency. The Southern states seceded from the Union in the months following Lincoln's election, forming the [[Confederate States of America]], and beginning the [[American Civil War]].

==Proposal and ratification==

===Crafting the amendment===
[[File:James Mitchell Ashley - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|Representative [[James Mitchell Ashley]] proposed an amendment abolishing slavery in 1863.]]
Acting under presidential war powers, Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on January 1, 1863, which proclaimed the freedom of slaves in the ten states that were still in rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Emancipation Proclamation|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=2013-06-27}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not affect the status of slaves in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] that had remained loyal to the Union.&lt;ref name="McPherson—1988——558"&gt;[[#CITEREFMcPherson1988|McPherson, 1988]], p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; That December, Lincoln again used his war powers and issued a "[[Ten percent plan|Proclamation for Amnesty and Reconstruction]]", which offered Southern states a chance to peacefully rejoin the Union if they abolished slavery and collected loyalty oaths from 10% of their voting population.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Southern states did not readily accept the deal, and the status of slavery remained uncertain.

In the final years of the Civil War, Union lawmakers debated various proposals for Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 48–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these called for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery nationally and permanently. On December 14, 1863, a bill proposing such an amendment was introduced by Representative [[James Mitchell Ashley]] of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard L. Richards, ''Who Freed the Slaves?: The Fight over the Thirteenth Amendment'' (2015) [https://www.amazon.com/Who-Freed-Slaves-Thirteenth-Amendment-ebook/dp/B00SLVOLU0/ excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=129|title=James Ashley|work=Ohio History Central|publisher=Ohio Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representative [[James F. Wilson]] of Iowa soon followed with a similar proposal. On January 11, 1864, Senator [[John B. Henderson]] of Missouri submitted a [[joint resolution]] for a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. The [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], chaired by [[Lyman Trumbull]] of Illinois, became involved in merging different proposals for an amendment.

[[Radical Republicans]] led by Massachusetts Senator [[Charles Sumner]] and Pennsylvania Representative [[Thaddeus Stevens]] sought a more expansive version of the amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), (2001), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 8, 1864, Sumner submitted a constitutional amendment stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All persons are equal before the law, so that no person can hold another as a slave; and the Congress shall have power to make all laws necessary and proper to carry this declaration into effect everywhere in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, "Instead of Waiting for the Thirteenth Amendment" (2010), pp. 741–742.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SocietyCommission1901"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michigan State Historical Society|title=Historical collections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yx0zAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA582|accessdate=December 5, 2012|year=1901|publisher=Michigan Historical Commission|page=582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sumner tried to promote his own more expansive wording by circumventing the Trumbull-controlled Judiciary Committee, but failed.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), pp. 52–53. "Sumner made his intentions clearer on February 8, when he introduced his constitutional amendment to the Senate and asked that it be referred to his new committee. So desperate was he to make his amendment the final version that he challenged the well-accepted custom of sending proposed amendments to the Judiciary Committee. His Republican colleagues would hear nothing of it.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 10, the Senate Judiciary Committee presented the Senate with an amendment proposal based on drafts of Ashley, Wilson and Henderson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://13thamendment.harpweek.com/hubpages/CommentaryPage.asp?Commentary=05ProposalPassage "Congressional Proposals and Senate Passage"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107164011/http://13thamendment.harpweek.com/hubpages/CommentaryPage.asp?Commentary=05ProposalPassage |date=November 7, 2006 }}, ''Harpers Weekly'', ''The Creation of the 13th Amendment'', Retrieved Feb 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 53. "It was no coincidence that Trumbull's announcement came only two days after Sumner had proposed his amendment making all persons 'equal before the law.' The Massachusetts senator had spurred the committee into final action."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee's version used text from the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, which stipulates, "There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said [[Northwest Territory|territory]], otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northwest Ordinance; July 13, 1787|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/nworder.asp|work=Avalon Project|publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library, Yale Law School|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McAward_McCulloch&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAward|first=Jennifer Mason|title=''McCulloch'' and the Thirteenth Amendment|journal=[[Columbia Law Review]]|volume=112|issue=7|pages=1769–1809|publisher=[[Columbia Law School]]|jstor=41708164|date=November 2012|url=http://columbialawreview.org/mcculloch-and-the-thirteenth-amendment/|ref=harv|postscript=.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030315/http://columbialawreview.org/mcculloch-and-the-thirteenth-amendment/|archivedate=November 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}} [https://www.webcitation.org/6ehZI7PeC?url=http://www.columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/1769-1810.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1786}} Though using Henderson's proposed amendment as the basis for its new draft, the Judiciary Committee removed language that would have allowed a constitutional amendment to be adopted with only a majority vote in each House of Congress and ratification by two-thirds of the states (instead of two-thirds and three-fourths, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 54. "Although it made Henderson's amendment the foundation of the final amendment, the committee rejected an article in Henderson's version that allowed the amendment to be adopted by the approval of only a simple majority in Congress and the ratification of only two-thirds of the states."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passage by Congress===
{{Further information|38th United States Congress}}

The Senate passed the amendment on April 8, 1864, by a vote of 38 to 6; two Democrats, [[Reverdy Johnson]] of Maryland and [[James Nesmith]] of Oregon voted "aye." However, just over two months later on June 15, the House failed to do so, with 93 in favor and 65 against, thirteen votes short of the two-thirds vote needed for passage; the vote split largely along party lines, with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposing.&lt;ref name="Goodwin—2005——686"&gt;[[#CITEREFGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], p. 686&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1864 presidential race, former [[Free Soil Party]] candidate [[John C. Frémont]] threatened a third-party run opposing Lincoln, this time on a platform endorsing an anti-slavery amendment. The Republican Party platform had, as yet, failed to include a similar plank, though Lincoln endorsed the amendment in a letter accepting his nomination.&lt;ref name="Goodwin—2005——624&amp;amp;ndash;25"&gt;[[#CITEREFGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], pp. 624–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foner—2010——299"&gt;[[#CITEREFFoner2010|Foner, 2010]], p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Fremont withdrew from the race on September 22, 1864 and endorsed Lincoln.&lt;ref name="Goodwin—2005——639"&gt;[[#CITEREFGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], p. 639&lt;/ref&gt;

With no Southern states represented, few members of Congress pushed moral and religious arguments in favor of slavery. Democrats who opposed the amendment generally made arguments based on [[federalism]] and [[states' rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, "Constitutional Politics, Constitutional Law, and the Thirteenth Amendment" (2012), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argued that the proposed change so violated the spirit of the Constitution that it would not be a valid "amendment" but would instead constitute "revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, "Constitutional Politics, Constitutional Law, and the Thirteenth Amendment" (2012), p. 179–180. Benedict quotes Sen. [[Garrett Davis]]: "there is a boundary between the power of revolution and the power of amendment, which the latter, as established in our Constitution, cannot pass; and that if the proposed change is revolutionary it would be null and void, notwithstanding it might be formally adopted." The full text of Davis's speech, with comments from others, appears in ''[https://archive.org/stream/greatdebatesina17millgoog/greatdebatesina17millgoog_djvu.txt Great Debates in American History]'' (1918), ed. Marion Mills Miller.&lt;/ref&gt; Representative White, among other opponents, warned that the amendment would lead to full citizenship for blacks.&lt;ref name="Colbert, 1995 p. 10"&gt;Colbert, "Liberating the Thirteenth Amendment" (1995), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Republicans portrayed slavery as uncivilized and argued for abolition as a necessary step in national progress.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, "Constitutional Politics, Constitutional Law, and the Thirteenth Amendment" (2012), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Amendment supporters also argued that the slave system had negative effects on white people. These included the lower wages resulting from competition with [[Unfree labour|forced labor]], as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South. Advocates said ending slavery would restore the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and other constitutional rights violated by censorship and intimidation in slave states.&lt;ref name="Colbert, 1995 p. 10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=tenBroek|first=Jacobus|title=Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States: Consummation to Abolition and Key to the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=California Law Review|volume=39|issue=2|page=180| doi=10.2307/3478033|jstor=3478033|date=June 1951|quote=''It would make it possible for white citizens to exercise their constitutional right under the comity clause to reside in Southern states regardless of their opinions.

White, Northern Republicans and some Democrats became excited about an abolition amendment, holding meetings and issuing resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Many blacks though, particularly in the South, focused more on land ownership and education as the key to liberation.&lt;ref name=TreleaseXvii&gt;Trelease, ''White Terror'' (1971), p. xvii. "Negroes wanted the same freedom that white men enjoyed, with equal prerogatives and opportunities. The educated black minority emphasized civil and political rights more than the masses, who called most of all for land and schools. In an agrarian society, the only kind most of them knew, landownership was associated with freedom, respectability, and the good life. It was almost universally desired by Southern blacks, as it was by landless peasants the world over. Give us our land and we can take care of ourselves, said a group of South Carolina Negroes to a Northern journalist in 1865; without land the old masters can hire us or starve us as they please."&lt;/ref&gt; As slavery began to seem politically untenable, an array of Northern Democrats successively announced their support for the amendment, including Representative [[James Brooks (politician)|James Brooks]],&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 73. "The first notable convert was Representative James Brooks of New York, who, on the floor of Congress on February 18, 1864, declared that slavery was dying if not already dead, and that his party should stop defending the institution."&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Reverdy Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 74. "The antislavery amendment caught Johnson's eye, however, because it offered an indisputable constitutional solution to the problem of slavery."&lt;/ref&gt; and the powerful New York [[political machine]] known as [[Tammany Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AdoptionOf13thAmendment.jpg|thumb|Celebration erupts after the amendment is passed by the House of Representatives.]]

President Lincoln had had concerns that the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 might be reversed or found invalid by the judiciary after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?298113-1/reputation-abraham-lincoln|title=The Reputation of Abraham Lincoln|website=C-SPAN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw constitutional amendment as a more permanent solution.&lt;ref name="Foner—2010——312&amp;amp;ndash;14"&gt;[[#CITEREFFoner2010|Foner, 2010]], pp. 312–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Donald—1996——396"&gt;[[#CITEREFDonald1996|Donald, 1996]], p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; He had remained outwardly neutral on the amendment because he considered it politically too dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 48. "The president worried that an abolition amendment might foul the political waters. The amendments he had recommended in December 1862 had gone nowhere, mainly because they reflected an outdated program of gradual emancipation, which included compensation and colonization. Moreover, Lincoln knew that he did not have to propose amendments because others more devoted to abolition would, especially if he pointed out the vulnerability of existing emancipation legislation. He was also concerned about negative reactions from conservatives, particularly potential new recruits from the Democrats.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Lincoln's 1864 party platform resolved to abolish slavery by constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sewanee.edu/faculty/willis/Civil_War/documents/republican.html|title=Republican Party Platform, 1864|author=Willis, John C.|publisher=University of the South|accessdate=2013-06-28|quote=Resolved, That as slavery was the cause, and now constitutes the strength of this Rebellion, and as it must be, always and everywhere, hostile to the principles of Republican Government, justice and the National safety demand its utter and complete extirpation from the soil of the Republic; and that, while we uphold and maintain the acts and proclamations by which the Government, in its own defense, has aimed a deathblow at this gigantic evil, we are in favor, furthermore, of such an amendment to the Constitution, to be made by the people in conformity with its provisions, as shall terminate and forever prohibit the existence of Slavery within the limits of the jurisdiction of the United States.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329015755/http://www.sewanee.edu/faculty/Willis/Civil_War/documents/republican.html|archivedate=March 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/vote/1864/index.html|title=1864: The Civil War Election|publisher=Cornell University|work=Get Out the Vote|year=2004|accessdate= 2013-06-28|quote=Despite internal Party conflicts, Republicans rallied around a platform that supported restoration of the Union and the abolition of slavery.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning reelection in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|election of 1864]], Lincoln made the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment his top legislative priority, beginning with his efforts in Congress during its "lame duck" session.&lt;ref name="Goodwin—2005——686&amp;amp;ndash;87"&gt;[[#CITEREFGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], pp. 686–87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 176–177, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular support for the amendment mounted and Lincoln urged Congress on in his December 6, [[1864 State of the Union Address]]: "there is only a question of ''time'' as to when the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action. And as it is to so go, at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the better?"&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln instructed Secretary of State William H. Seward, Representative [[John B. Alley]] and others to procure votes by any means necessary, and they promised government posts and campaign contributions to outgoing Democrats willing to switch sides.&lt;ref name="Foner—2010——312&amp;amp;ndash;13"&gt;[[#CITEREFFoner2010|Foner, 2010]], pp. 312–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodwin—2005——687"&gt;[[#CITEREFGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], p. 687&lt;/ref&gt; Seward had a large fund for direct bribes. Ashley, who reintroduced the measure into the House, also lobbied several Democrats to vote in favor of the measure.&lt;ref name="Goodwin—2005——687&amp;amp;ndash;689"&gt;[[#CITEREFGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], pp. 687–689&lt;/ref&gt; Representative Thaddeus Stevens later commented that "the greatest measure of the nineteenth century was passed by corruption aided and abetted by the purest man in America"; however, Lincoln's precise role in making deals for votes remains unknown.&lt;ref name="Donald—1996——554"&gt;[[#CITEREFDonald1996|Donald, 1996]], p. 554&lt;/ref&gt;

Republicans in Congress claimed a mandate for abolition, having gained in the elections for [[United States Senate elections, 1864|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1864|House]].&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 187. "But the clearest sign of the people's voice against slavery, argued amendment supporters, was the recent election. Following Lincoln's lead, Republican representatives like Godlove S. Orth of Indiana claimed that the vote represented a 'popular verdict . . . in unmistakable language' in favor of the amendment."&lt;/ref&gt; The 1864 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Representative [[George H. Pendleton]], led opposition to the measure.&lt;ref name="Goodwin—2005——688"&gt;[[#CITEREFGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], p. 688&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans toned down their language of radical equality in order to broaden the amendment's coalition of supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 191. "The necessity of keeping support for the amendment broad enough to secure its passage created a strange situation. At the moment that Republicans were promoting new, far-reaching legislation for African Americans, they had to keep this legislation detached from the first constitutional amendment dealing exclusively with African American freedom. Republicans thus gave freedom under the antislavery amendment a vague construction: freedom was something more than the absence of chattel slavery but less than absolute equality."&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reassure critics worried that the amendment would tear apart the social fabric, some Republicans explicitly promised that the amendment would leave patriarchy intact.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), pp. 191–192. "One of the most effective methods used by amendment supporters to convey the measure's conservative character was to proclaim the permanence of patriarchal power within the American family in the face of this or ''any'' textual change to the Constitution. In response to Democrats who charged that the antislavery was but the first step in a Republican design to dissolve all of society's foundations, including the hierarchical structure of the family, the Iowa Republican John A. Kasson denied any desire to interfere with 'the rights of a husband to a wife' or 'the right of [a] father to his child."&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-January 1865, Speaker of the House [[Schuyler Colfax]] estimated the amendment to be five votes short of passage. Ashley postponed the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, Lincoln intensified his push for the amendment, making direct emotional appeals to particular members of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 198. "It was at this point that the president wheeled into action on behalf of the Amendment […] Now he became more forceful. To one representative whose brother had died in the war, Lincoln said, 'your brother died to save the Republic from death by the slaveholders' rebellion. I wish you could see it to be your duty to vote for the Constitutional amendment ending slavery.'"&lt;/ref&gt; On January 31, 1865, the House called another vote on the amendment, with neither side being certain of the outcome. With 183 House members present, 122 would have to vote "aye" to secure passage of the resolution; however eight Democrats abstained, reducing the number to 117. Every Republican (84), Independent Republican (2) and Unconditional Unionist (16) supported the measure, as well as 14 Democrats, almost all of them lame ducks, and 3 Unionists. The amendment finally passed by a vote of 119 to 56,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/38-2/h480|title=TO PASS S.J. RES. 16.  (P. 531-2).|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; narrowly reaching the required two-thirds majority.&lt;ref name="Foner—2010——313"&gt;[[#CITEREFFoner2010|Foner, 2010]], p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; The House exploded into celebration, with some members openly weeping.&lt;ref name="Foner—2010——314"&gt;[[#CITEREFFoner2010|Foner, 2010]], p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; Black onlookers, who had only been allowed to attend Congressional sessions since the previous year, cheered from the galleries.&lt;ref name="McPherson—1988——840"&gt;[[#CITEREFMcPherson1988|McPherson, 1988]], p. 840&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Constitution does not provide the President any formal role in the amendment process, the joint resolution was sent to Lincoln for his signature.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, "Lawfulness of the Reconstruction Amendments" (2001), p. 389. "For reasons that have never been entirely clear, the amendment was presented to the President pursuant to Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution, and signed.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the usual signatures of the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, President Lincoln wrote the word "Approved" and added his signature to the joint resolution on February 1, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Resolution Submitting 13th Amendment to the States; signed by Abraham Lincoln and Congress|work=The Abraham Lincoln Papers at the Library of Congress: Series 3.

"But many held that the President's signature was not essential to an act of this kind, and, on the fourth of February, Senator Trumbull offered a resolution, which was agreed to three days later, that the approval was not required by the Constitution; 'that it was contrary to the early decision of the Senate and of the Supreme Court; and that the negative of the President applying only to the ordinary cases of legislation, he had nothing to do with propositions to amend the Constitution'."&lt;/ref&gt; The Thirteenth Amendment is the only ratified amendment signed by a President, although [[James Buchanan]] had signed the [[Corwin Amendment]] that the [[36th United States Congress|36th Congress]] had adopted and sent to the states in March 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, ''Constitutional History'' (1901), p. 154. "The President signed the joint resolution on the first of February. Somewhat curiously the signing has only one precedent, and that was in spirit and purpose the complete antithesis of the present act. President Buchanan had signed the proposed amendment of 1861, which would make slavery national and perpetual."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln's struggle to get the amendment through Congress, while bringing the war to an end, is portrayed in ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Thirteenth Amendment was submitted to the states on February 1, 1865, it was quickly taken up by several legislatures. By the end of the month, it had been ratified by eighteen states. Among them were the ex-Confederate states of Virginia and Louisiana, where ratifications were submitted by Reconstruction governments. These, along with subsequent ratifications from Arkansas and Tennessee raised the issues of how many seceded states had legally valid legislatures; and if there were fewer legislatures than states, if Article V required ratification by three-fourths of the states or three-fourths of the legally valid state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (2001), ''Lawfulness of the Reconstruction Amendments'', p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; President Lincoln in his last speech, on April 11, 1865, called the question about whether the Southern states were in or out of the Union a "pernicious abstraction." Obviously, he declared, they were not "in their proper practical relation with the Union"; whence everyone's object should be to restore that relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Samuel Eliot Morison]]|title=The Oxford History of the American People|year=1965|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|was assassinated]] three days later.

With Congress out of session, the new President, [[Andrew Johnson]], began a period known as "Presidential Reconstruction", in which he personally oversaw the creation of new state governments throughout the South. He oversaw the convening of state political conventions populated by delegates whom he deemed to be loyal. Three leading issues came before the conventions: secession itself, the abolition of slavery, and the Confederate war debt. Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina held conventions in 1865, while Texas' convention did not organize until March 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, "Lawfulness of the Reconstruction Amendments" (2001), pp. 394–397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric L.

He believed he could silence those who wished to deny the Southern states their place in the Union by pointing to how essential their assent had been to the successful ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg (2001), ''Final Freedom'', pp. 227–228.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Slavery}}
Direct negotiations between state governments and the Johnson administration ensued. As the summer wore on, administration officials began including assurances of the measure's limited scope with their demands for ratification. Johnson himself suggested directly to the governors of Mississippi and North Carolina that they could proactively control the allocation of rights to freedmen. Though Johnson obviously expected the freed people to enjoy at least some civil rights, including, as he specified, the right to testify in court, he wanted state lawmakers to know that the power to confer such rights would remain with the states.&lt;ref name="Vorenberg, 2001 p. 229"&gt;Vorenberg (2001), ''Final Freedom'', p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; When South Carolina provisional governor [[Benjamin Franklin Perry]] objected to the scope of the amendment's enforcement clause, Secretary of State Seward responded by telegraph that in fact the second clause "is really restraining in its effect, instead of enlarging the powers of Congress".&lt;ref name="Vorenberg, 2001 p. 229"/&gt; White politicians throughout the South were concerned that Congress might cite the amendment's enforcement powers as a way to authorize black suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois (1935), ''Black Reconstruction'', p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

When South Carolina ratified the amendment in November 1865, it issued its own interpretive declaration that "any attempt by Congress toward legislating upon the political status of former slaves, or their civil relations, would be contrary to the Constitution of the United States".&lt;ref name=McAward_McCulloch /&gt;{{rp|1786–1787}}&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe (1901), ''Constitutional History'', p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Alabama and Louisiana also declared that their ratification did not imply federal power to legislate on the status of former slaves.&lt;ref name=McAward_McCulloch /&gt;{{rp|1787}}&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis (2004), ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; During the first week of December, North Carolina and Georgia gave the amendment the final votes needed for it to become part of the Constitution.

Having been ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states (27 of the 36 states, including those that had been ''in rebellion''), Secretary of State Seward, on December 18, 1865, certified that the Thirteenth Amendment had become valid, to all intents and purposes, as a part of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=013/llsl013.db&amp;recNum=803 Seward certificate] proclaiming the Thirteenth Amendment to have been adopted as part of the Constitution as of December 6, 1865.&lt;/ref&gt; Included on the enrolled list of ratifying states were the three ex-Confederate states that had given their assent, but with strings attached.

The impact of the abolition of slavery was felt quickly. When the Thirteenth Amendment became operational, the scope of Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation was widened to include the entire nation.

In addition to abolishing slavery and prohibiting involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, the Thirteenth Amendment also nullified the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]] and the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]]. The population of a state originally included (for congressional apportionment purposes) all "free persons", three-fifths of "other persons" (i.e., [[slave]]s) and excluded untaxed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The Three-Fifths Compromise was a provision in the Constitution that required three-fifths of the population of slaves be counted for purposes of apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and taxes among the states. This compromise had the effect of increasing the political power of slave-holding states by increasing their share of seats in the House of Representatives, and consequently their share in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] (where a state's influence over the election of the President is tied to the size of its congressional delegation).&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 17 &amp; 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html "The Thirteenth Amendment"], ''Primary Documents in American History'', Library of Congress. Retrieved Feb 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as the Thirteenth Amendment was working its way through the ratification process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}&lt;ref name="Stromberg111"&gt;Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine|last=Nelson|first=William E.|year=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674041424|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=thirteenth+amendment+%22three+fifths%22#v=onepage&amp;q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and economic change in the South===

Southern culture remained deeply racist, and those blacks who remained faced a dangerous situation. J. J. Gries reported to the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]]: "There is a kind of innate feeling, a lingering hope among many in the South that slavery will be regalvanized in some shape or other. They tried by their laws to make a worse slavery than there was before, for the freedman has not the protection which the master from interest gave him before."&lt;ref name=Gries&gt;J. J. Gries to the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], quoted in Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction'' (1935), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] wrote in 1935:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Slavery was not abolished even after the Thirteenth Amendment. There were four million freedmen and most of them on the same plantation, doing the same work that they did before emancipation, except as their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and apparently were going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or on the streets of the cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction'' (1935), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Official emancipation did not substantially alter the economic situation of most blacks who remained in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Trelease, ''White Terror'' (1971), p. xviii. "The truth seems to be that, after a brief exulation with the idea of freedom, Negroes realized that their position was hardly changed; they continued to live and work much as they had before."&lt;/ref&gt;

As the amendment still permitted labor as punishment for convicted criminals, Southern states responded with what historian [[Douglas A. Blackmon]] called "an array of interlocking laws essentially intended to criminalize black life".{{sfn|Blackmon|2008|p=53}} These laws, passed or updated after emancipation, were known as [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]].&lt;ref name="Stromberg111" /&gt; Mississippi was the first state to pass such codes, with an 1865 law titled "An Act to confer Civil Rights on Freedmen".&lt;ref name=Novak2&gt;Novak, ''Wheel of Servitude'' (1978), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mississippi law required black workers to contract with white farmers by January 1 of each year or face punishment for vagrancy.{{sfn|Blackmon|2008|p=53}} Blacks could be sentenced to forced labor for crimes including petty theft, using obscene language, or selling cotton after sunset.{{sfn|Blackmon|2008|p=100}} States passed new, strict [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] laws that were selectively enforced against blacks without white protectors.{{sfn|Blackmon|2008|p=53}}&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The labor of these convicts was then sold to farms, factories, lumber camps, quarries, and mines.{{sfn|Blackmon|2008|p=6}}

After its ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865, the South Carolina legislature immediately began to legislate Black Codes.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), pp. 230–231. "The black codes were a violation of freedom of contract, one of the civil rights that Republicans expected to flow from the amendment. Because South Carolina and other states anticipated that congressional Republicans would try to use the Thirteenth Amendment to outlaw the codes, they made the preemptive strike of declaring in their ratification resolutions that Congress could not use the amendment's second clause to legislate on freed people's civil rights."&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Codes created a separate set of laws, punishments, and acceptable behaviors for anyone with more than one black great-grandparent. Under these Codes, Blacks could only work as farmers or servants and had few Constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Ginsberg, ''Moses of South Carolina: A Jewish Scalawag during Radical Reconstruction''; Johns Hopkins Press, 2010; pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=44uF943aw18C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 44]–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions on [[Forty acres and a mule|black land ownership]] threatened to make economic subservience permanent.&lt;ref name=TreleaseXvii /&gt;

Some states mandated indefinitely long periods of child "apprenticeship".&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Some laws did not target Blacks specifically, but instead affected farm workers, most of whom were Black. At the same time, many states passed laws to actively prevent Blacks from acquiring property.&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional and executive enforcement==

As its first [[Congressional power of enforcement|enforcement legislation]], Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], guaranteeing black Americans citizenship and equal protection of the law, though not the right to vote. The amendment was also used as authorizing several [[Freedmen's Bureau bills]]. President Andrew Johnson vetoed these bills, but Congress overrode his vetoes to pass the Civil Rights Act and the Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), pp. 233–234.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[W. E. B. Du Bois]], "[https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/01mar/dubois2.htm The Freedmen's Bureau]", ''The Atlantic'', March 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the Act, including Trumbull and Wilson, argued that Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized the federal government to legislate civil rights for the States. Others disagreed, maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from slavery.&lt;ref name=McAward_McCulloch /&gt;{{rp|1788–1790}} Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek to overturn the legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (1868) defining citizenship and mandating equal protection under the law, and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] (1870) banning racial voting restrictions.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=23–24}}

The [[Freedmen's Bureau]] enforced the amendment locally, providing a degree of support for people subject to the Black Codes.&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 50–51. "Blacks applied to local provost marshalls and Freedmen's Bureau for help against these child abductions, particularly in those cases where children were taken from living parents. Jack Prince asked for help when a woman bound his maternal niece. Sally Hunter requested assistance to obtain the release of her two nieces. Bureau officials finally put an end to the system of indenture in 1867".&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocally, the Thirteenth Amendment established the Bureau's legal basis to operate in Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;Forehand, "Striking Resemblance" (1996), p. 99–100, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil Rights Act circumvented racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks access to the federal courts. The [[Enforcement Acts]] of 1870–1871 and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], in combating the violence and intimidation of white supremacy, were also part of the effort to end slave conditions for Southern blacks.&lt;ref name="Tsesis66"&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the effect of these laws waned as political will diminished and the federal government lost authority in the South, particularly after the [[Compromise of 1877]] ended [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] in exchange for a Republican presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 56–57, 60–61. "If the Republicans had hoped to gradually use section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment to pass Reconstruction legislation, they would soon learn that President Johnson, using his veto power, would make increasingly more difficult the passage of any measure augmenting the power of the national government. Further, with time, even leading antislavery Republicans would become less adamant and more willing to reconcile with the South than protect the rights of the newly freed. This was clear by the time Horace Greely accepted the Democratic nomination for president in 1872 and even more when President Rutherford B. Hayes entered the Compromise of 1877, agreeing to withdraw federal troops from the South."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peonage law===
Southern business owners sought to reproduce the profitable arrangement of slavery with a system called [[peonage]], in which disproportionately black workers were entrapped by loans and compelled to work indefinitely due to the resulting debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tobias Barrington Wolff|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=Vol. 102|number=4|date=May 2002|at=p. 981 in 973-1050|title=Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global Economy|doi=10.2307/1123649|quote=Peonage was a system of forced labor that depended upon the indebtedness of a worker, rather than an actual property right in a slave, as the means of compelling work. A prospective employer would offer a laborer a "loan" or "advance" on his wages, typically as a condition  of employment, and then use the newly created debt to compel the worker to remain on the job for as long as the employer wished.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Wolff982b /&gt; Peonage continued well through Reconstruction and ensnared a large proportion of black workers in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wolff|journal=Columbia Law Review|title=The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global Economy|date=May 2002|at=p. 982|doi= 10.2307/1123649|quote=Legally sanctioned peonage arrangements blossomed in the South following the Civil War and continued into the twentieth century. According to the Professor Jacqueline Jones, 'perhaps as many as one-third of all [sharecropping farmers] in Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia were being held against their will in 1900.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workers remained destitute and persecuted, forced to work dangerous jobs and further confined legally by the racist [[Jim Crow laws]] that governed the South.&lt;ref name=Wolff982b&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Columbia Law Review
|author=Wolff|title=The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global Economy|date=2002|at=p. 982(?)|doi=10.2307/1123649|quote=Not surprisingly, employers used peonage arrangements primarily in industries that involved hazardous working conditions and very low pay. While black workers were not the exclusive victims of peonage arrangements in America, they suffered under its yoke in vastly disproportionate numbers. Along with Jim Crow laws that segregated transportation and public facilities, these laws helped to restrict the movement of freed black workers and thereby keep them in a state of poverty and vulnerability.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peonage differed from chattel slavery because it was not strictly hereditary and did not allow the sale of people in exactly the same fashion. However, a person's debt—and by extension a person—could still be sold, and the system resembled antebellum slavery in many ways.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, "The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global Economy" (May 2002), p. 982. "It did not recognize a property right in a human being (a peon could not be sold in the manner of a slave); and the condition of peonage did not work 'corruption of blood' and travel to the children of the worker. Peonage, in short, was not chattel slavery. Yet the practice unquestionably reproduced many of the immediate practical realities of slavery—a vast underclass of laborers, held to their jobs by force of law and threat of imprisonment, with few if any opportunities for escape."&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Peonage Act of 1867]], Congress abolished "the holding of any person to service or labor under the system known as peonage",&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights" (2001), p. 1638.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically banning "the voluntary or involuntary service or labor of any persons as peons, in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Soifer, "Prohibition of Voluntary Peonage" (2012), p. 1617.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the Department of Justice created the Civil Rights Section, which focused primarily on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and [[labor rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights" (2001), p. 1616.&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing scrutiny of [[totalitarianism]] in the lead-up to World War II brought increased attention to issues of slavery and involuntary servitude, abroad and at home.&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights" (2001), pp. 1619–1621.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system.&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights" (2001), pp. 1626–1628.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]], the Civil Rights Section invoked the constitutional amendments and legislation of the Reconstruction Era as the basis for its actions.&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights" (2001), pp. 1629, 1635.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the DOJ successfully prosecuted Elizabeth Ingalls for keeping domestic servant Dora L. Jones in conditions of slavery. The court found that Jones "was a person wholly subject to the will of defendant; that she was one who had no freedom of action and whose person and services were wholly under the control of defendant and who was in a state of enforced compulsory service to the defendant."&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights" (2001), p. 1668.&lt;/ref&gt; The Thirteenth Amendment enjoyed a swell of attention during this period, but from ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) until ''[[Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.]]'' (1968) it was again eclipsed by the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights", pp. 1680–1683.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penal labor exemption==
{{seealso|Penal labor in the United States|Convict lease}}
The Thirteenth Amendment exempts penal labor from its prohibition of forced labor. This allows prisoners who have been convicted of crimes (not those merely awaiting trial) to be required to perform labor or else face punishment while in custody.&lt;ref name="howe" /&gt;

Few records of the committee's deliberations during the drafting of the Thirteenth Amendment survived, and the debate in both Congress and the state legislatures that followed featured almost no discussion of this provision. It was apparently considered noncontroversial at the time, or at least legislators gave it little thought.&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howe|first1=Scott|date=2009|title=Slavery as Punishment: Original Public Meaning, Cruel and Unusual Punishment, and the Neglected Clause in the Thirteenth Amendment|url=http://arizonalawreview.org/howe/|journal=[[Arizona Law Review]]|volume=51|issue=4|pages=983|access-date=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drafters based the amendment's phrasing on the [[Northwest Ordinance|Northwest Ordinance of 1787]], which features an identical exception.&lt;ref name="howe" /&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] authored an early version of that ordinance's anti-slavery clause, including the exception of punishment for a crime, and also sought to prohibit slavery in general after 1800. Jefferson was an admirer of the works of Italian criminologist [[Cesare Beccaria]].&lt;ref name="howe" /&gt; Beccaria's ''[[On Crimes and Punishments]]'' suggested that the [[death penalty]] should be abolished and replaced with a lifetime of enslavement for the worst criminals; Jefferson likely included the clause due to his agreement with Beccaria. Beccaria, while attempting to reduce "legal barbarism" of the 1700s, considered forced labor one of the few harsh punishments acceptable; for example, he advocated slave labor as a just punishment for [[robbery]], so that the thief's labor could be used to pay recompense to their victims and to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beccaria|first=Cesare|date=1764|title=On Crimes and Punishments|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/beccaria-an-essay-on-crimes-and-punishments|author-link=Cesare Beccaria}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penal "hard labor" has ancient origins, and was adopted early in American history (as in Europe) often as a substitute for capital or corporal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Hard Labor|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Prisons and Correctional Facilities|publisher=SAGE Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMmlCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT565&amp;lpg=PT565&amp;dq=history+of+hard+labor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VQHVqD6Hne&amp;sig=wiUz3ObgSmzyWre-Jl5UA8emTKU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0ipWJsa_YAhUESN8KHdzlAEE4ChDoAQhBMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=history%2520of%2520hard%2520labor&amp;f=false|last=Weiss|first=Robert P.|date=2005|editor-last=Bosworth|editor-first=Mary|language=en|isbn=9781506320397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various commentators have accused states of abusing this provision to re-establish systems similar to slavery, or of otherwise exploiting such labor in a manner unfair to local labor. The [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] in the South criminalized "[[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]]", which was largely enforced against freed slaves. Later, [[convict lease]] programs in the South allowed local plantations to rent inexpensive prisoner labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/prison-labor-in-america/406177/|title=American Slavery, Reinvented|first=Whitney|last=Benns|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of these programs have been phased out (leasing of convicts was forbidden by President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1941), prison labor continues in America under a variety of justifications. Prison labor programs vary widely; some are uncompensated prison maintenance tasks, some are for local government maintenance tasks, some are for local businesses, and others are closer to internships. Modern rationales for prison labor programs often include reduction of recidivism and re-acclimation to society; the idea is that such labor programs will make it easier for the prisoner upon release to find gainful employment rather than relapse to criminality. However, this topic is not well-studied, and much of the work offered is so menial as to be unlikely to improve employment prospects.&lt;ref name="econprison"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21718897-idaho-prisoners-roast-potatoes-kentucky-they-sell-cattle-prison-labour|title=Prison labour is a billion-dollar industry, with uncertain returns for inmates|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, most prison labor programs do compensate prisoners, but generally with very low wages. What wages they do earn are often heavily [[Garnishment|garnished]], with as much as 80% of a prisoner's paycheck withheld in the harshest cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/443747/prison-labor-laws-wages-make-it-close-slavery|title=Give Working Prisoners Dignity — and Decent&amp;nbsp;Wages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, entertainer [[Kanye West]] advocated for repealing the Thirteenth Amendment's exception for penal labor in a meeting with President [[Donald Trump]], calling the exception a "trap door."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/10/11/17964558/kanye-west-donald-trump-white-house-13th-amendment|title=Kanye West’s meeting with President Trump turned into an extended rant on mental health and the 13th Amendment|last=Nilsen|first=Ella|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|date=October 11, 2018|accessdate=Oct 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial interpretation==
In contrast to the other "Reconstruction Amendments", the Thirteenth Amendment was rarely cited in later case law. As historian Amy Dru Stanley summarizes, "beyond a handful of landmark rulings striking down debt peonage, ﬂagrant involuntary servitude, and some instances of race-based violence and discrimination, the Thirteenth Amendment has never been a potent source of rights claims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amy Dru Stanley|date=June 2010|title=Instead of Waiting for the Thirteenth Amendment: The War Power, Slave Marriage, and Inviolate Human Rights|journal=American Historical Review|volume=115|issue=3|pages=735}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425002519.html|title=Thirteenth Amendment (Judicial Interpretation)|author=Kenneth L.

===Black slaves and their descendants===

Kentucky law prohibited blacks from testifying against whites—an arrangement which compromised the ability of Nancy Talbot ("a citizen of the United States of the African race") to reach justice against a white person accused of robbing her. After Talbot attempted to try the case in federal court, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled this federal option unconstitutional. [[Noah Swayne]] (a Supreme Court justice sitting on the Kentucky Circuit Court) overturned the Kentucky decision, holding that without the material enforcement provided by the Civil Rights Act, slavery would not truly be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seth P. Waxman, "[http://scholarship.law.ge/ orgetown.edu/facpub/287/ Twins at Birth: Civil Rights and the Role of the Solicitor General]{{Dead link|date=June 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=no}}", ''Indiana Law Journal'' 75, 2000; pp. 1302–1303.&lt;/ref&gt; With ''In Re Turner'' (1867), Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]] ordered freedom for Elizabeth Turner, a former slave in Maryland who became indentured to her former master.&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Blyew v. United States]]'', (1872)&lt;ref&gt;80 U.S. 581 (1871)&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court heard another Civil Rights Act case relating to federal courts in Kentucky. John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin of a black family, the Fosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice in the head with an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. Federal courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. The Supreme Court ruled that the Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and [[Joseph P. Bradley]] dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Blyew'' case set a precedent in state and federal courts that led to the erosion of Congress's Thirteenth Amendment powers. The Supreme Court continued along this path in the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' (1873), which upheld a state-sanctioned monopoly of white butchers. In ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876), the Court ignored Thirteenth Amendment dicta from a circuit court decision to exonerate perpetrators of the [[Colfax massacre]] and invalidate the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]].&lt;ref name="Tsesis66" /&gt;

Doe'''; Publisher: University of San Francisco Law Review, Volume 42, Spring 2008, Pages 1045–1076; here page 1058-1059. The article was developed from a working paper prepared for the roundtable, "The Education of All Our Children: The 25th Anniversary of Plyler v. Doe," sponsored by the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Race, Ethnicity &amp; Diversity (University of California, Berkeley, Boalt Hall School of Law), held on May 7, 2007.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003732/http://lawblog.usfca.edu/lawreview/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/A52.pdf|date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the U.S. Supreme Court explicated in the Slaughter-House Cases with respect to the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]] Amendment and the Thirteenth Amendment in special:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Undoubtedly while negro slavery alone was in the mind of the Congress which proposed the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.&lt;ref&gt;The Slaughter-House Cases, 83 U.S. (36 Wall.), at 72 (1873)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' (1883),&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Cases 1883"/&gt; the Supreme Court reviewed five consolidated cases dealing with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], which outlawed racial discrimination at "inns, public conveyances on land or water, theaters, and other places of public amusement". The Court ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment did not ban most forms of racial discrimination by non-government actors.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=122}} In the majority decision, Bradley wrote (again in non-binding dicta) that the Thirteenth Amendment empowered Congress to attack "badges and incidents of slavery". However, he distinguished between "fundamental rights" of citizenship, protected by the Thirteenth Amendment, and the "social rights of men and races in the community".&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority opinion held that "it would be running the slavery argument into the ground to make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make as to guests he will entertain, or as to the people he will take into his coach or cab or car; or admit to his concert or theatre, or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appleton's Annual Cyclopædia and Register of Important Events of the Year ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ5RAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=June 11, 2013|year=1888|publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Company|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his solitary dissent, [[John Marshall Harlan]] (a Kentucky lawyer who changed his mind about civil rights law after witnessing organized racist violence) argued that "such discrimination practiced by corporations and individuals in the exercise of their public or quasi-public functions is a badge of servitude, the imposition of which congress may prevent under its power."&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court in the ''Civil Rights Cases'' also held that appropriate legislation under the amendment could go beyond nullifying state laws establishing or upholding slavery, because the amendment "has a reflex character also, establishing and decreeing universal civil and political freedom throughout the United States" and thus Congress was empowered "to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United States."&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Cases 1883"&gt;{{caselaw source|case=''Civil Rights Cases'', 109 U.S. 3 (1883)|findlaw=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=109&amp;page=3|justia=http://supreme.justia.com/us/109/3/case.html|other_source1=LII|other_url1=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-us-cite?109+3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court stated about the scope the amendment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This amendment, as well as the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]], is undoubtedly self-executing, without any ancillary legislation, so far as its terms are applicable to any existing state of circumstances. By its own unaided force and effect, it abolished slavery and established universal freedom. Still, legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases and circumstances to be affected by it, and to prescribe proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or spirit. And such legislation may be primary and direct in its character, for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Cases 1883"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Attorneys in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896)&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|163|537|1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that [[racial segregation]] involved "observances of a servile character coincident with the incidents of slavery", in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment. In their brief to the Supreme Court, Plessy's lawyers wrote that "distinction of race and caste" was inherently unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court rejected this reasoning and upheld state laws enforcing segregation under the "[[separate but equal]]" doctrine. In the (7–1) majority decision, the Court found that "a statute which implies merely a legal distinction between the white and colored races—a distinction which is founded on the color of the two races and which must always exist so long as white men are distinguished from the other race by color—has no tendency to destroy the legal equality of the two races, or reestablish a state of involuntary servitude."{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=162, 164–65}} Harlan dissented, writing: "The thin disguise of 'equal' accommodations for passengers in railroad coaches will not mislead any one, nor, atone for the wrong this day done."&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hodges v. United States]]'' (1906),&lt;ref&gt;203 U.S. 1 (1906)&lt;/ref&gt; the Court struck down a federal statute providing for the punishment of two or more people who "conspire to injure, oppress, threaten or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States". A group of white men in Arkansas conspired to violently prevent eight black workers from performing their jobs at a lumber mill; the group was convicted by a federal grand jury. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal statute, which outlawed conspiracies to deprive citizens of their liberty, was not authorized by the Thirteenth Amendment. It held that "no mere personal assault or trespass or appropriation operates to reduce the individual to a condition of slavery". Harlan dissented, maintaining his opinion that the Thirteenth Amendment should protect freedom beyond "physical restraint".&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Corrigan v. Buckley'' (1922) reaffirmed the interpretation from ''Hodges'', finding that the amendment does not apply to [[restrictive covenant]]s.

Enforcement of federal civil rights law in the South created numerous peonage cases, which slowly traveled up through the judiciary. The Supreme Court ruled in ''Clyatt v. United States'' (1905) that peonage was involuntary servitude. It held that although employers sometimes described their workers' entry into contract as voluntary, the servitude of peonage was always (by definition) involuntary.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, "The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global Economy" (2002), p. 983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Bailey v. Alabama]]'' the U.S. Supreme Court again reaffirmed its holding that Thirteenth Amendment was not solely a ban on chattel slavery, but also covers a much broader array of labor arrangements and social deprivations&lt;ref name="OntiverosDrexler20130721" /&gt; In addition to the aforesaid the Court also ruled on Congress enforcement power under the Thirteenth Amendment. The Court said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The plain intention [of the amendment] was to abolish slavery of whatever name and form and all its badges and incidents; to render impossible any state of bondage; to make labor free, by prohibiting that control by which the personal service of one man is disposed of or coerced for another's benefit, which is the essence of involuntary servitude. While the Amendment was self-executing, so far as its terms were applicable to any existing condition, Congress was authorized to secure its complete enforcement by appropriate legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey v. Alabama, 219 U.S. 219, 241 (1910).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====''Jones'' and beyond====

Legal histories cite ''[[Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.]]'' (1968) as a turning point of Thirteen Amendment jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=Tsesis3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colbert, "Liberating the Thirteenth Amendment" (1995), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court confirmed in ''Jones'' that Congress may act "rationally" to prevent private actors from imposing "badges and incidents of servitude".&lt;ref name=Tsesis3&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 3. "After Reconstruction, however, a series of Supreme Court decisions substantially diminished the amendment's significance in achieving genuine liberation. The Court did not revisit the amendment's meaning until 1968, during the heyday of the Civil Rights movement. In ''Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer'', the Court found that the Thirteenth Amendment not only ended unrecompensed, forced labor but that its second section also empowered Congress to develop legislation that is 'rationally' related to ending any remaining 'badges and incidents of servitude'."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornell20151022"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. 392 U.S. 409 (1968)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/392/409|publisher=Legal Information Institute at Cornell University Law School|accessdate=22 October 2015|quote=Syllabus: "[T]he badges and incidents of slavery that the Thirteenth Amendment empowered Congress to eliminate included restraints upon  those fundamental rights which are the essence of civil freedom, namely, the same right&amp;nbsp;... to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens. ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'', 09 U.S. 3, 22. Insofar as ''[[Hodges v. United States]]'', 203 U.S. 1, suggests a contrary holding, it is overruled." Footnote 78: "[W]e note that the entire Court [in the Civil Rights Cases; content added] agreed upon at least one proposition: the Thirteenth Amendment authorizes Congress not only to outlaw all forms of slavery and involuntary servitude, but also to eradicate the last vestiges and incidents of a society half slave and half free by securing to all citizens, of every race and color, the same right to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.&amp;nbsp;... The conclusion of the majority in ''Hodges'' rested upon a concept of congressional power under the Thirteenth Amendment irreconcilable with the position taken by every member of this Court in the Civil Rights Cases and incompatible with the history and purpose of the Amendment itself. Insofar as Hodges is inconsistent with our holding today, it is hereby overruled."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joneses were a black couple in [[St. Louis County, Missouri]] who sued a real estate company for refusing to sell them a house. The Court held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation.&amp;nbsp;... this Court recognized long ago that, whatever else they may have encompassed, the badges and incidents of slavery – its "burdens and disabilities" – included restraints upon "those fundamental rights which are the essence of civil freedom, namely, the same right&amp;nbsp;... to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens." [[Civil Rights Cases]], 109 U. S. 3, 109 U. S. 22.&lt;ref&gt;'[[Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.]]'', 392 U.S. 409 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as the Black Codes, enacted after the Civil War to restrict the free exercise of those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Negro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a promise of freedom—freedom to "go and come at pleasure" and to "buy and sell when they please"—would be left with "a mere paper guarantee" if Congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man. At the very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live. If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Shay, "[https://lcrm.lib.unc.edu/blog/index.php/2012/06/17/remembering-jones-v-alfred-h-mayer-co/ Remembering Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013303/https://lcrm.lib.unc.edu/blog/index.php/2012/06/17/remembering-jones-v-alfred-h-mayer-co/ |date=September 28, 2013 }}", ''Publishing the Long Civil Rights Movement'', 17 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court in ''Jones'' reopened the issue of linking racism in contemporary society to the history of slavery in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Colbert, "Liberating the Thirteenth Amendment" (1995), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Jones'' precedent has been used to justify Congressional action to protect migrant workers and target sex trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 3. "The Court's holding in ''Jones'' enables Congress to pass statutes against present-day human rights violations, such as the trafficking of foreign workers as sex slaves and the exploitation of migrant agricultural workers as peons."&lt;/ref&gt; The direct enforcement power found in the Thirteenth Amendment contrasts with that of the Fourteenth, which allows only responses to institutional discrimination of [[state actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 112–113. "... the Thirteenth Amendment remains the principal constitutional source requiring the federal government to protect individual liberties against arbitrary private and public infringements that resemble the incidents of involuntary servitude. Moreover, the Thirteenth Amendment is a positive injunction requiring Congress to pass laws to that end, while the Fourteenth Amendment is 'responsive' to 'unconstitutional behavior.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other cases of involuntary servitude===
The Supreme Court has taken an especially narrow view of involuntary servitude claims made by people not descended from black (African) slaves. In ''Robertson v. Baldwin'' (1897), a group of merchant seamen challenged federal statutes which criminalized a seaman's failure to complete their contractual term of service. The Court ruled that seamen's contracts had been considered unique from time immemorial, and that "the amendment was not intended to introduce any novel doctrine with respect to certain descriptions of service which have always been treated as exceptional". In this case, as in numerous "badges and incidents" cases, Justice Harlan authored a dissent favoring broader Thirteenth Amendment protections.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, "The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global Economy" (2002), p. 977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Selective Draft Law Cases]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|245|366|1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled that the [[Conscription in the United States|military draft]] was not "involuntary servitude". In ''[[United States v. Kozminski]]'',&lt;ref name="Koz"&gt;{{ussc|487|931|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment did not prohibit compulsion of servitude through psychological coercion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/amdt13.html "Thirteenth Amendment—Slavery and Involuntary Servitude"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211032034/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/amdt13.html |date=February 11, 2007 }}, GPO Access, U.S. Government Printing Office, p. 1557&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Risa Goluboff (2001), "The 13th Amendment and the Lost Origins of Civil Rights," ''Duke Law Journal'', Vol 50, no. 228, p. 1609&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kozminski'' defined involuntary servitude for purposes of criminal prosecution as "a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury or by the use or threat of coercion through law or the legal process. This definition encompasses cases in which the defendant holds the victim in servitude by placing him or her in fear of such physical restraint or injury or legal coercion."&lt;ref name="Koz" /&gt;

The [[United States courts of appeals|U.S. Courts of Appeals]], in ''[[Immediato v. Rye Neck School District]]'', ''Herndon v. Chapel Hill'', and ''Steirer v. Bethlehem School District'', have ruled that the use of [[community service]] as a high school graduation requirement did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loupe|first=Diane|date=August 2000|title=Community Service: Mandatory or Voluntary? – Industry Overview|journal=School Administrator|page=8|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JSD/is_7_57/ai_77204744/pg_8/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515145925/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JSD/is_7_57/ai_77204744/pg_8/|archivedate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior proposed Thirteenth Amendments==
During the six decades following the 1804 ratification of the Twelfth Amendment two proposals to amend the Constitution were adopted by Congress and sent to the states for ratification. Neither has been ratified by the number of states necessary to become part of the Constitution. Commonly known as the [[Titles of Nobility Amendment]] and the [[Corwin Amendment]], both are referred to as ''Article Thirteen'', as was the successful Thirteenth Amendment, in the [[joint resolution]] passed by Congress.
*The Titles of Nobility Amendment (pending before the states since May 1, 1810) would, if ratified, strip [[Citizenship in the United States|citizenship]] from any United States citizen who accepts a title of [[nobility]] or honor from a foreign country without the consent of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2009|title=Titles of Nobility|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the United States Constitution|publisher=Infobase|author=Mark W.

*The Corwin Amendment (pending before the states since March 2, 1861) would, if ratified, [[Entrenched clause|shield]] "domestic institutions" of the states (in 1861 this was a common euphemism for slavery) from the [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment process]] and from abolition or interference by Congress.&lt;ref name='AmendmentsNotRatified'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/house/Amendnotrat.shtml|title=Constitutional Amendments Not Ratified|accessdate=2013-11-21|publisher=United States House of Representatives|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702135703/http://www.house.gov/house/Amendnotrat.shtml|archivedate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foner—2010——158"&gt;[[#CITEREFFoner2010|Foner, 2010]], p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tresorit''' is an online [[cloud storage]] service based in [[Switzerland]] and [[Hungary]] that emphasizes enhanced security and data encryption for Businesses and individuals/freelancers. The Business version offers up to 1TB of storage space per user (the Solo version offers 2TB for one user) and extra security features such as DRM,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tresorit Brings DRM To Cloud Data|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2014/08/19/tresorit-brings-drm-to-cloud-data/|website = Forbes|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; granular access levels and other functions which aim to create a safer collaborative environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tresorit for Business|url = https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2015/04/02/tresorit-for-business/|website = Help Net Security|access-date = 2016-02-22|first = Berislav|last = Kucan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tresorit has been likened to a high-security alternative to [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505143_162-57580572/get-5gb-of-free-ultra-secure-storage/ |title=Ultra-secure storage |publisher=CBS News |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reviewtechnica.com/2014/07/tresorit-review.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Tresorit's service is accessible through client desktop software, web-based application and mobile apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tresorit.com/blog/our-biggest-update-yet-in-2015-work-securely-without-installing-tresorit-using-your-browser/ |title=Our biggest update yet in 2015 – work securely without installing Tresorit, using your browser |date=2015-07-29 |accessdate=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the software is available for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Windows Phone 8]], [[iOS]], and [[Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maclife.com/article/news/weekend_recap_intel_ceo_iphone_handbrake_099_tresorit_mac_teased |title=Weekend Recap: Intel CEO on iPhone, Handbrake 0.9.9, Tresorit for Mac Teased &amp;#124; Mac&amp;#124;Life |publisher=Maclife.com |date=2013-05-20 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Tresorit was founded in 2011 by Hungarian programmers [[Istvan Lam]], who remains CEO, [[Szilveszter Szebeni]], who is currently CIO and [[Gyorgy Szilagyi]], who is the CPO of the company.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tresorit.com/management |title=Management - Tresorit &amp;#124; We encrypt - You share |publisher=Tresorit |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611233605/http://tresorit.com/management |archivedate=11 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tresorit officially launched its [[client-side encryption|client-side encrypted]] cloud storage service after emerging from its stealth beta in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/04/18/tresorit-opens-end-end-encryption-file-sharing-service-public/ Tresorit opens its end-to-end encrypted file-sharing service to the public&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, [[Wuala]] (owned by [[LaCie]] and [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]]), a pioneer of secure cloud storage, announced it was closing its service after 7 years, and recommended their users to choose Tresorit as their secure cloud alternative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2422588/seagate-and-lacie-spark-security-concerns-by-killing-off-wuala-cloud-storage/ Seagate and LaCie spark security concerns by killing off Wuala cloud storage]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2015/aug/19/wuala-cloud-storage-shuts-down-offers-tresorit-potential-new-home/ Wuala cloud storage to shut down, offers Tresorit as potential new home]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2016, Tresorit launched a beta of the [[Software development kit|software development kit (SDK)]] ZeroKit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tresorit.com/0_kit|title=0_kit by Tresorit: End-to-end Encryption for Your App|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s SDK project [[CareKit]] announced the option for mobile app developers using CareKit to integrate ZeroKit, enabling [[Zero-knowledge proof|zero knowledge user authentication]] and encryption for medical and health apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carekit.org/blog.html#article-10|title=CareKit + ZeroKit: Protect patient data in the cloud|last=|first=|date=|website=CareKit|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2017/01/11/apple-zerokit-security-carekit/|title=Apple enhances security options for its CareKit apps|last=Hinchliffe|first=Emma|website=Mashable|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Tresorit encrypts files using [[client-side encryption]] with [[AES-256]] before uploading them. Files are also secured by [[HMAC]] message authentication codes applied on [[SHA-512]] hashes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifehacker.com/5994394/get-50gb-of-free-encrypted-online-storage-from-tresorit Get 50GB of Free, Encrypted Online Storage from Tresorit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tresors" (German for [[vault (disambiguation)|vaults]]) are encrypted counterparts of uploaded directories. Tresors automatically sync with the cloud as files are added or removed from them, similar to [[Box.com]] and [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]'s desktop software. The main difference between Tresorit and its competition is that Tresorit applies AES-256 client-side encryption to files while they are still local and then uploads them to the cloud. The company claims that due to its [[end-to-end encryption]], users can share protected files and folders with others and work together on them, keeping the documents synced and secure in every step of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tresorit.com/security|title=Cloud Storage Security - Secure Cloud Storage from Tresorit|website=tresorit.com|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are additional layers of security, but the core privacy feature of the service is that the encryption key never leaves the user:&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/2013/09/02/tresorit-takes-on-prism-provoked-worries-with-encrypted-cloud-storage/ Tresorit takes on PRISM-provoked worries with encrypted cloud storage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[Zero-knowledge proof|Zero-Knowledge]] encryption protocols,&lt;ref&gt;https://tresorit.com/blog/zero-knowledge-encryption/&lt;/ref&gt; Tresorit is not in possession of the users’ authentication data, so the content of files cannot be accessed from their servers nor delivered to authorities upon request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tresorit.com/blog/here-is-tresorit-first-transparency-report/|title=Here is Tresorit's first transparency report|date=2017-12-14|work=Tresorit Blog|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hacking contest==
In 2013 and 2014, Tresorit hosted a hacking contest offering $10,000 to anyone who hacked their data encryption methods to gain access to their servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/04/11/secure-cloud-storage-outfit-tresorit-posts-10k-hacker-bounty/ |title=Secure cloud storage outfit Tresorit posts $10K hacker bounty — Tech News and Analysis |publisher=Gigaom.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some months, the reward was increased to $25,000 and later to $50,000, challenging experts from institutions like [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]] or [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2013/11/12/hungarian-security-freaks-hack-our-startup-and-well-give-you-25k-exclusive/ Hungarian ‘security freaks’: Hack our startup and we’ll give you $25K&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2013/12/19/hackers-heres-a-way-to-make-an-easy-25k// Hackers, Here's a Way To Make An Easy $25k&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/2013/12/17/secure-cloud-firm-tresorit-boosts-hacker-bounty-to-25000/// Secure cloud firm Tresorit boosts hacker bounty to $25,000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The contest ran for 468 days and according to the company, nobody was able to break the encryption. &lt;ref&gt;https://tresorit.com/business/wuala-alternative&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Tresorit has received a number of nominations and awards. Up-Cloud Rewards named it one of the top 5 Cloud security solutions for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axxissolutions.com/up-cloud-computing-conference-start-cloud-awards-rankings-as-of-october-17-2012/ UP Cloud Computing Conference-Start Cloud Awards rankings as of October 17, 2012&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630141749/http://www.axxissolutions.com/up-cloud-computing-conference-start-cloud-awards-rankings-as-of-october-17-2012/ |date=30 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130312114650/http://up-con.com/UP-StartFinalists awards | UP 2012 - Cloud Computing Conference 2012&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Early 2016, [[Forbes]] listed Tresorit's cofounder Istvan Lam among the European "30 under 30".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mfg45jmjh/istvan-lam-28/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Tresorit was listed as finalist in the Cybersecurity Excellence Awards, category Encryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cybersecurity-excellence-awards.com/2017-cybersecurity-product-awards-winners-finalists/|title=2017 Cybersecurity Product Awards - Winners and Finalists - Cybersecurity Excellence Awards|website=cybersecurity-excellence-awards.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States-Israel Advanced Research Partnership Act of 2016''' (H.R. 5877) was a bill introduced in the United States House by U.S. Representative [[John Ratcliffe (American politician)|John Ratcliffe]] (R-Texas). The Democratic cosponsor is Representative [[James Langevin]] (D-RI). The legislation, which was signed into law, allows the U.S. and Israel to cooperate on [[Computer security|cybersecurity]] technologies research and development.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/19295-ratcliffe-langevin-introduce-two-bills-u-s-israel-cybersecurity-initiatives/|title=Ratcliffe, Langevin introduce two bills for U.S.-Israel cybersecurity initiatives|last=|first=|date=2016-07-19|newspaper=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2017-02-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Cybersecurity industry experts believe that collaboration between countries is one of the best way to prevent cyber attacks. A critical need exists for countries to share research and development in the cybersecurity world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-israel-set-to-boost-teamwork-on-cybersecurity/|title=US, Israel set to boost teamwork on cybersecurity|last=Shoshanna|first=Solomon|date=2016-11-30|newspaper=The Times of Israel|access-date=2017-02-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and Israel work together in a research and development program called the [[Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2014 law authorized the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] to work with Israel on a pilot program to improve:
* Border security
* Maritime security
* Aviation security

== Legislative details ==
H.R. 5877 makes the program permanent by removing the “pilot” designation and adds cybersecurity as the fourth program area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/114th-congress/house-report/827 House Report 114-827: United States-Israel Advanced Research Partnership Act of 2016]. U.S. Congress (House of Representatives). 114th Congress. 2nd session. 2016-11-05. Retrieved 2017-02-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law allows the Department of Homeland Security to work together with Israel on cybersecurity initiatives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52041|title=H.R. 5877, United States-Israel Advanced Research Partnership Act of 2016|date=2016-09-22|newspaper=Congressional Budget Office|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law doesn't authorize any new expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5877/text|title=Enrolled Bill: Text: H.R.5877 — 114th Congress (2015-2016)|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Department of Homeland Security is already carrying out activities similar to this, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated that the law would not affect spending. Additionally, H.R. 5877 does not contain any intergovernmental or private-sector mandates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Legislative history ==
The bill followed this path from introduction to being signed into law:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5877/actions|title=Actions Overview H.R.5877 — 114th Congress (2015-2016)|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 7/14/16 - The bill was introduced in the House.
* 11/15/16 - It was amended and reported favorably by the [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|House Committee on Homeland Security]].
* 11/29/16 - The bill was passed by the full House of Representatives by voice vote.
* 12/10/16 - The Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent.
* 12/16/16 - President Barack Obama signed the bill into law, making it Public Law 114-304.

It is also notable in its rejection of the concepts of [[quasi-property]] and [[privacy]] in the framework of the [[common law]]. It has been observed that the concept of property itself cannot be entirely satisfactorily explained without accounting, in some way or other, for the ruling in ''Victoria Park Racing''.&lt;ref name="Gray 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kevin Gray|year= 1991|title= Property in Thin Air|journal= [[Cambridge Law Journal]]|volume= 50|issue= |pages= 252{{Endash}}307|publisher= |doi= 10.1017/s0008197300080508|pmid= |pmc= |url= http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/show.php?dowid=872|accessdate=21 January 2013|ref={{harvid|Gray|1991}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It arose from the manner in which [[radio broadcasting]] in Australia in the 1930s challenged the monopolies of [[horse racing|racing club]]s who exercised tight control over access to the racecourse, supported by existing laws, with minimal media reporting in the form of scores scratched on boards at the racecourse and more detailed newspaper summaries after the event.&lt;ref name="Richardson &amp; Trabsky 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Megan Richardson |author2= Marc Trabsky|year= 2011|title= Radio and the Technology of the Common Law in 1930s Australia: Victoria Park Racing v Taylor Revisited|journal= Griffith Law Review|volume= 20|issue= 4|pages= 1020{{Endash}}1037|publisher= [[University of Melbourne]]|doi= |pmid= |pmc= |ssrn= 2060666|accessdate=|ref={{harvid|Richardson|Trabsky|2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1022}}

The [[plaintiff]] owned [[Victoria Park Racecourse, Sydney|Victoria Park]], a [[horse racing|racing track]] which charged admissions to people who placed bets on the races. The racecourse was surrounded by a very high fence. Taylor, who had a house and front yard adjacent to the course, allowed the radio broadcasting station [[2UW]] to construct a five-metre high platform on scaffolding from which someone could see into the course and broadcast – with the help of binoculars — the races and information about horses posted at the ground, which facilitated unregulated [[off-track betting]]. Attendance at the ground plummeted.

The Plaintiff claimed that on-track betting was lower as a result of the broadcasts, as people who had previously come to the track were now listening on the radio instead and Taylor was profiting at the expense of the plaintiff.

He applied to the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] for an [[injunction]] against Taylor on the footing of nuisance and breach of copyright. [[Privacy]] and non-natural use of property were also cited as grounds. It was common ground that the mere construction and use of the raised platform constituted no breach of building or zoning regulations or of the betting and gaming legislation or indeed of the regulations governing broadcasting.

The injunction was denied,&lt;ref name=NSWSC&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWStRp|55|1936|litigants=Victoria Park Racing &amp; Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor |parallelcite=(1936) 37 [[State Reports (New South Wales)|SR (NSW)]] 322 |date=26 November 1936 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the decision was appealed to the High Court.

==Ruling at the High Court==

In a 3-2 decision, the appeal was dismissed, as no wrong was committed that was known to the law. Separate opinions were issued by all justices {{emdash}} Latham CJ, Dixon and McTiernan JJ for the majority, and Rich and Evatt JJ in dissent.

:* There was no property in a spectacle.&lt;ref name="Gray 1991"/&gt; As [[John Latham (judge)|Latham CJ]] noted:

{{Quotation|
I find difficulty in attaching any precise meaning to the phrase "property in a spectacle." A "spectacle" cannot be "owned" in any ordinary sense of that word. Even if there were any legal principle which prevented one person from gaining an advantage for himself or causing damage to another by describing a spectacle produced by that other person, the rights of the latter person could be described as property only in a metaphorical sense. Any appropriateness in the metaphor would depend upon the existence of the legal principle. The principle cannot itself be based upon such a metaphor.&lt;ref name="1937 HCA 45"/&gt;{{rp|p 497}}

:* Nor could copyright be claimed in any information being posted on signs in the park:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Jill McKeough |editor= Andrew T. Kenyon, Megan Richardson and Sam Ricketson|title= Landmarks in Australian Intellectual Property Law|chapter= Horses and the Law: the enduring legacy of ''Victoria Park Racing''|accessdate= 21 January 2013|year= 2009|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|location= Melbourne|url = http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/research-publications/bitstream/handle/10453/8125/2008003331OK.pdf?sequence=1|isbn= 978-0-521-51686-0|page= |pages=53{{endash}}72|ref={{harvid|McKeough|2009}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}}

{{Quotation|
The law of copyright does not operate to give any person an exclusive right to state or to describe particular facts. A person cannot by first announcing that a man fell off a bus or that a particular horse won a race prevent other people from stating those facts.&lt;ref name="1937 HCA 45"/&gt;{{rp|p 498}}}}

:* There was no proof that nuisance had been brought upon the race track, as [[Edward McTiernan|McTiernan J]] observed:

{{Quotation|
It is not shown that the broadcasting interferes with the use and enjoyment of the land or the conduct of the race meetings or the comfort or enjoyment of any of the plaintiff's patrons. Indeed, it appears quite impossible that any such result would be caused by the action of Angles&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/angles-cyril-joseph-9367 Australian Dictionary of Biography - Angles, Cyril Joseph (1906–1962)]&lt;/ref&gt; in standing on this platform aloof from the racecourse, observing the races and talking into a microphone or telephone. The principle upon which liability for acts in the nature of nuisance is founded is not to be restrained by the instances in which that liability has been found to exist. The list of acts which may give rise to an action on the case in the nature of nuisance is not closed against broadcasting. But to broadcast a lawful description of what is happening on premises cannot be an actionable nuisance at least unless it causes substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises.&lt;ref name="1937 HCA 45"/&gt;{{rp|pp 523-4}}}}

:* The Court did not recognize the existence of a legal right to privacy. As Latham CJ stated:

{{Quotation|
With regard to the question of privacy, no doubt the owner of a house would prefer that a neighbour should not have the right of looking into his windows or yard, but neither this court nor a court of law will interfere on the mere ground of invasion of privacy; and a party has a right even to open new windows, although he is thereby enabled to overlook his neighbour's premises, and so interfering, perhaps, with his comfort.&lt;ref name="1937 HCA 45"/&gt;{{rp|p 540}}}}

:* Building the platform was not an unnatural use of property, as it did not breach any bylaws.

==Impact==

The case was notable for rejecting the concept of [[quasi-property]] that had been recently adopted by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''International News Service v. Associated Press'',&lt;ref&gt;''International News Service v. Associated Press'', {{ussc|248|215|1918|format=j}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been influential in many common-law jurisdictions in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The reluctance was summarized by Dixon J thus:

{{Quotation|
If English law had followed the course of development that has recently taken place in the United States, the "broadcasting rights" in respect of the races might have been protected as part of the quasi-property created by the enterprise, organization and labour of the plaintiff in establishing and equipping a racecourse and doing all that is necessary to conduct race meetings. But courts of equity have not in British jurisdictions thrown the protection of an injunction around all the intangible elements of value, that is, value in exchange, which may flow from the exercise by an individual of his powers or resources whether in the organization of a business or undertaking or the use of ingenuity, knowledge, skill or labour. This is sufficiently evidenced by the history of the law of copyright and by the fact that the exclusive right to invention, trade marks, designs, trade name and reputation are dealt with in English law as special heads of protected interests and not under a wide generalization.&lt;ref name="1937 HCA 45"/&gt;{{rp|pp 508-9}}}}

As to the question of privacy, the High Court subsequently declared in ''ABC v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=ABC v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd|link=|court=HCA|num=63|year=2001|pinpoint=|parallelcite=(2001) 208 CLR 199|date=15 November 2001|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ''Victoria Park'' was not a case about privacy. Rather, it was concerned with allocating the right to appropriate and control how information can be made public.&lt;ref name="Stewart 2002"&gt;{{cite web |author= Daniel Stewart |title= Protecting Privacy, Property, and Possums: Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/FedLRev/2002/6.html|ref={{harvid|Stewart|2002}}}} (2002) 30(1) Federal Law Review 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Off-track betting was subsequently brought under State regulation in New South Wales by the ''Gaming and Betting (Amendment) Act 1938'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/act/1938-7.pdf ''Gaming and Betting (Amendment) Act 1938'' (NSW) George VI, No. 7, 1938]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Parliament of Australia]] later passed the ''Broadcasting and Television Act 1956'',&lt;ref&gt;''Broadcasting and Television Act 1956'' (Cth) (No. 33 of 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; prohibiting television stations (but not radio stations) from televising "the whole or part of a sporting event or other entertainment held in Australia … in a place in which a charge is made for admission, if the images of the sporting event or other entertainment originate from the use of equipment outside that place". Radio stations were not included, as they had previously reached an agreement on the matter with the racecourse owners.&lt;ref name="Richardson &amp; Trabsky 2011"/&gt;{{rp|1034}}

'''Woodrow Wilson Mann''' (November 13, 1916 &amp;ndash; August 6, 2002) was an [[United States|American]] politician who was the [[mayor]] of the capital city of [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]], from 1956 to 1957.

A Little Rock native, Mann attended the [[University of Illinois]] and fought in [[World War II]] with the [[United States Navy]] in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]]. He was a member of the staff of Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]]. Upon his return to the United States, he established an insurance agency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/09/us/woodrow-mann-dies-at-85-sought-troops-in-little-rock.html]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Mann unseated Mayor [[Pratt C. Remmel]], a two-term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], in the 1955 municipal election and took office on January 1, 1956.

The [[Little Rock Nine]] [[Segregation in the United States|school desegregation]] case occurred near the end of Mann's term as mayor in 1957. Outraged by [[governor of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Orval Faubus]]' order that [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] troops block the entrance of the students at [[Little Rock Central High School]], Mann sent a telegram to President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to request federal troops. Eisenhower soon authorized the troops. After his term as mayor, Mann moved in 1960 to [[Houston]], [[Texas]], where he died in 2002&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/aug/31/guardianobituaries.usa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/10/local/me-mann10]&lt;/ref&gt; and is interred at Memorial Oaks Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Mann&amp;GSfn=Woodrow&amp;GSmn=Wilson&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=7060622&amp;df=all&amp;|title=Woodrow Wilson Mann|publisher=Findagrave.com|accessdate=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Peng Yu had encountered Xu Shoulan after she had [[falling (accident)|fallen]] and [[bone fracture|broken]] her [[femur]]. Peng Yu assisted Xu Shoulan and brought her to a local hospital for further care. Xu Shoulan accused Peng Yu of having caused her to fall, and demanded that he pay her medical expenses. The court decided in favor of the plaintiff and held Peng liable for damages, reasoning that despite the lack of concrete evidence, "no one would in good conscience help someone unless they felt guilty". The verdict received widespread media coverage, and engendered a public outcry against the decision. It is regarded as a landmark case because of its implication that the Chinese public is vulnerable to [[civil liability]] for lending help in [[emergency]] situations due to the lack of any [[Good Samaritan law]]s.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/1281/22PRLPJ691.pdf?sequence=1 | title=The Aftermath of Peng Yu: Restoring Helping Behavior in China | publisher=Pacific Rim Law &amp; Policy Journal Association | accessdate=23 October 2015 | author=Young, Melody W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The incident == 
November 20, 2006, Peng Yu encountered Xu Shoulan, an elderly lady, after she had disembarked from a city bus and fallen. Peng brought Xu to the hospital, and contributed 200 RMB towards her treatment. At the hospital, Xu was diagnosed with a fractured femur and was told that she would have to undergo femur replacement surgery. Xu demanded that Peng pay for her medical costs, and when he refused, sued him for [[personal injury]] compensation, claiming that he caused her fall. After out-of-court mediation failed, the case was brought before the Gulou District Court in [[Nanjing]] on April 1, 2007. In court, Xu claimed that she had seen that Peng bumped into her, whereas Peng maintained that he only approached Xu after he had seen her fall. An eyewitness present at the scene, Chen Erchun, claimed that Xu had inexplicably fallen as she was transferring between two buses. He maintained that Peng had only arrived at the scene after Xu had fallen, and that he himself had assisted the two of them in calling Xu's relatives. These statements were categorically rejected by Xu Shoulan at the third court [[hearing (law)|hearing]].&lt;ref name="sina"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2011-11-08/115823432989.shtml | title=南京彭宇案再调查:老太去世 原法官调任街道办 | publisher=sina.com.cn | accessdate=23 October 2015| language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case concluded with Peng admitting to have accidentally pushed Xu as he was getting off the bus, and agreed to pay her 10,000 yuan compensation in the [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]] reached in March 2008. The two sides withdrew their [[appeal]]s and came to an agreement that they would not disclose details of the case.&lt;ref name="china.org.cn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/2012-01/17/content_24426931.htm | title='Good Samaritan' admits he pushed woman | publisher=china.org.cn | date=8 January 2012 | author=Shanghai Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt;
