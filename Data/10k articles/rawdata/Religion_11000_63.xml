'''Abacomancy''', also known as ''Amathomancy'' (from the Greek word "amathos" meaning sand) a form of [[divination]] based on the interpretation of the patterns in [[dust]], [[dirt]], [[silt]], [[sand]], or the ashes of the recently deceased.  Reading the patterns is believed to give some insight into the future.  Readers drop the dirt, sand, or ashes on a flat surface and start looking for a pattern that may represent symbols or pictures.  They interpret these symbols and pictures to what is going to happen in the future.  Some look for certain symbols that are seen over and over. Jackson Pollock, renowned painter, was famous for his series of paintings on abacomancy, which focused on the patterns in the paintings he made to foretell the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Naifeh|first1=Steven W.|last2=Smith|first2=Gregory White|title=Jackson Pollock: An American Saga|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYZQAAAAMAAJ|publisher=C.N.

'''''Acacia salicina''''' is a thornless species of ''[[Acacia]]'' tree native to [[Australia]].

Common names include '''Cooba''', '''Native Willow''', '''Willow Wattle''', '''Broughton Willow''','''Sally Wattle''' and '''Black Wattle'''.

It is a large [[shrub]] or small evergreen&lt;ref name="edu"&gt;[http://e-commerce.pvc.maricopa.edu/cis234/jsummers/Final/PlantList.xml Gardens At Carefree Town Center - Plant Identification List] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408234903/http://e-commerce.pvc.maricopa.edu/cis234/jsummers/Final/PlantList.xml |date=April 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tree]] growing 3 to 20 m tall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/NSWfl.pl?page=nswfl&amp;showsyn=&amp;dist=&amp;constat=&amp;lvl=sp&amp;name=Acacia~salicina  PlantNet - FloraOnline - Royal Botanic Gardens &amp; Domain Trust, Sydney Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a life span of about 10–15 years.  In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], ''Acacia salicina'' flowers primarily from October to January and the seed pods are often visible from April to July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cals.arizona.edu/pubs/crops/az1359/az13592b.pdf PDF] Ursula K. Schuch and Margaret Norem, Growth of Legume Tree Species
Growing in the Southwestern United States, University of Arizona.&lt;/ref&gt; The tree's seeds are shiny, black and have a crimson appendage-like [[aril]].&lt;ref name="species"&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/species-bank/sbank-treatment2.pl?id=2006 Species Bank Treatment for Acacia Salicina]&lt;/ref&gt;
''Acacia salicina'' is "closely related" to ''[[Acacia ligulata]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flora.sa.gov.au/cgi-bin/texhtml.cgi?form=speciesfacts&amp;keyname=Acacia+ligulata Fact Sheet for Acacia ligulata]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Acacia bivenosa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewattle.com/speciesgallery/ligulata.php WorldWideWattle]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical compounds==

===Wood===
*(−)-7,8,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavanone&lt;ref name="publish"&gt;[http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/CH9641164.htm Australian Journal of Chemistry]&lt;/ref&gt;
*7,8,3',4'-tetrahydroxydihydroflavonol&lt;ref name="publish"/&gt;
*7,8,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavonol&lt;ref name="publish"/&gt;

== Natural growing conditions ==
''A. salicina'' is found parts of [[Eastern Australia]]. The average yearly precipitation over the entire range is 375-550mm, with the plant itself found growing in regions receiving in excess of 1500mm annually in northern Queensland and as low as 100mm annually in central Australia. Its natural altitude range is from 50-300m above sea level.&lt;ref name="species"/&gt;  It does well in full sun exposure and it tolerates frosts down to -6.7 deg. C (-20 deg. F).&lt;ref name="edu"/&gt;

== Uses ==
[[Image:Acacia-salicina-tree2.jpg|thumb|right|''Acacia salicina'']]

===Erosion management===
''A. salicina'' can be used to help stabilize riverbanks and other areas.&lt;ref name="csu"&gt;[http://www.csu.edu.au/herbarium/acacsali_sws.html Acacia Salicina]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fodder===
The tree's foliage and seed pods are important [[fodder]] for livestock during dry periods, since the tree can withstand drought quite well.&lt;ref name="csu"/&gt;  Its foliage and pods compare quite poorly to other fodders with regard to digestibility by [[livestock]].  This affects its available nutritional value.&lt;ref name="www"&gt;[http://www.worldwidewattle.com/infogallery/utilisation/acaciasearch/pdf/salicina.pdf Acacia Search]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia’ records that "The leaves are eaten by stock. This is another tree which is rapidly becoming scarce, owing to the partiality of stock to it."&lt;ref name="J. H. Maiden 1889"&gt;{{cite book | author=J. H. Maiden | year=1889 | title=The useful native plants of Australia : Including Tasmania | publisher= Turner and Henderson, Sydney | url=https://primo-slnsw.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=SLNSW_ALMA21105097830002626&amp;context=L&amp;vid=SLNSW&amp;search_scope=EEA&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
The seeds are edible.&lt;ref name="csu"/&gt;

===Landscaping===
[[Image:Acacia-salicina-branches3.jpg|thumb|right|''Acacia salicina'' branches with seed pods]]
''A. salicina'' is excellent for [[landscaping]] in dry areas.&lt;ref name="csu"/&gt;

===Tannin===
The bark has a high [[tannin]] content.&lt;ref name="csu"/&gt;

===Wood===
[[Image:Acacia-salicina-bark2.jpg|thumb|right|''Acacia salicina'' Bark]]
The wood is very hard and it is used in making fine [[furniture]].&lt;ref name="csu"/&gt; At one time, the tree's wood was used in the manufacture of [[axle]]s for wagon wheels.
''Acacia salicina's'' wood burns nicely and makes good fuel.&lt;ref name="csu"/&gt;  Its calorific content is 18900kJ/kg dry mass.&lt;ref name="www"/&gt;  The tree produces seed and timber for woodworking in as little as five years after planting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/CA256F310024B628/0/E37E9A13CF973970CA256F9A008064F9/$File/Issue+27+Autumn+2003.pdf Victorian Landcare &amp; Catchment Management], Autumn 2003 Issue 27 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
The bark has been traditionally put to use by [[Indigenous Australians]] as a [[toxin]] for [[fishing]].&lt;ref name="csu"/&gt;  The leaves of ''A. salicina'' are thought to be psychoactive, since indigenous Australians "burn its leaves and smoke the ash to obtain a state of inebriation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QN78GmmPGBQC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=acacia+alkaloids&amp;sig=PhyzzX2xziMBVNMeTLX7qjPfZv4 Handbook Of Medicinal Plants By Zohara. Yaniv, Uriel Bachrach]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia’ records that common names included "Native Willow" and "Broughton Willow" near the Broughton River in South Australia. It also records it was called "Cooba" or "Kooba" by Indigenous People in Western New SOuth WAles and "Motherumba" by thos on the Castlereagh River, New South Wales."&lt;ref name="J. H. Maiden 1889"/&gt;

==Weed status==
Acacia salicina spreads widely through seed dipersal, and individual trees can rapidly form thickets through production of adventitious shoots from the root system. The species has become a significant weed over some of its native &lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldwidewattle.com/infogallery/utilisation/acaciasearch/pdf/salicina.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nativevegetation.nsw.gov.au/p/fact_sheet_9_list.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719234214/http://www.nativevegetation.nsw.gov.au/p/fact_sheet_9_list.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced &lt;ref&gt;[http://invasive.m-fuukei.jp/sdetail.php?g=Acacia&amp;s=salicina Invasive weeds database&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; range

An '''Arabist''' is someone normally from outside the [[Arab world]] who specialises in the study of the [[Arabic language]] and [[Arab culture|culture]] (usually including [[Arabic literature]]).

==Origins==

{{See also|Al Andalus}}

Arabists began in [[Al Andalus|medieval Muslim Spain]], which lay on the frontier between the [[Muslim world]] and [[Christendom]]. At various times, either a Christian or a Muslim kingdom might be the most hospitable toward scholars. Translation of Arabic texts into [[Latin]] (mostly of works on [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]]) began as early as the 10th century, major works dates from the [[School of Toledo]], which began during the reign of [[Alfonso VII of Castile]], (1105&amp;ndash;1157).

Translations were made into [[medieval Latin]] or [[Church Latin]], then Europe's ''[[lingua franca]]'', or into [[medieval Spanish]], which was the [[vernacular language]] of that time and place. Early translations included works by [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Ghazali]], [[Avicebron]], etc.; books on astronomy, [[astrology]], and [[medicine]]; and the works of some of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosophers, especially [[Aristotle]], who unlike [[Plato]] had previously been relatively unknown and largely ignored in European [[Christendom]]. The philosophical translations were accompanied by the Islamic commentaries, e.g., on Al-Ghazali, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), and Ibn Rushd ([[Averroës]]), to the point of there being an identifiable [[Averroism|Averroist]] [[school of philosophy]] in [[Christian Europe]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

&lt;!--Help still needed with translations of titles in next section--&gt;
This cultural borrowing from the Arab culture enjoyed the strong patronage of [[Alfonso X of Castile]] (1221–1284), who commissioned translations of major works into the [[Latin]] and the [[Castilian Spanish]] of the time. This led to the first Spanish translation of the [[Qur'an]], and of such influential works as ''[[Kalilah and Dimnah]]'', ''Libro de los Engannos e Asayamientos de las Mugeres'' (''Book of the Deceits and Lies of Women''), the ''Escala de Mahomá'' ([[Isra and Miraj|''The Ascension of Mohammed'']]) and ''Los juegos del ajedrez''{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;!-- Is this Libro de juegos y tablas? Then it is not a translation. --&gt; (''The Games of Chess'').

The works of Alfonso X in history and astronomy drew on numerous elements of Muslim knowledge. Also, the ''[[Tales of Count Lucanor]]'', by [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena|Juan Manuel]] and ''[[Libro de buen amor|El Libro de buen amor]]'' (''The Book of Good Love'') by [[Arcipreste de Hita]] from this period both show an interpenetration and symbiosis of Oriental and [[Spanish culture]]s.

==Arabists and the Reconquista==

{{See also|Reconquista}}

With the [[Reconquista]] well under way, Arabist efforts in Spain were sometimes closely tied to the goal of the possibility of proselytizing [[Christianity]] in the Arab world.

Spain was so dynamic a center of medieval Arabism as to draw scholars from throughout Christian Europe, notably [[Gerard of Cremona]], [[Herman of Carinthia]], [[Michael Scotus]], and [[Robert of Ketton]]. In 1143, Robert of Ketton made the first Latin translation of the [[Qur'an]], at the request of [[Peter the Venerable]], [[abbot of Cluny]]. [[Marcos de Toledo]] produced another translation of the Qur'an in the 13th century under a mandate from archbishop [[Rodrigo Ximénez de Rada]], who later edited the landmark ''Historia Arabum'' ("history of the Arabs"), drawing on the work of [[al-Razi]] for the knowledge of al-Andalus prior to the [[Almoravid]] conquest.

This trend continued in the 15th century, with [[Juan de Segovia]]'s trilingual Qur'an (Arabic, Spanish, and Latin), now lost, and [[Cardinal Cisneros]]'s [[Biblia Polyglota|multilingual Bible]]. In the 16th century, [[Pedro de Alcalá]] produced his Arabic primers for Spanish speakers, and several histories were written about the previous century's reconquest of the [[Kingdom of Granada]] with its aftermath of Moorish uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;Two of these histories are the ''Guerra de Granada'' (''War of Granada'') by [[Diego Hurtado de Mendoza (poet and diplomat)|Diego Hurtado de Mendoza]] and the ''Historia de la rebelión y castigo de los moriscos'' (''History of the Rebellion and Punishment of the Moors'') by [[Mármol Carvajal]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eclipse and renewal of Spanish Arabists==

{{See also|Spanish Inquisition}}
As Arabism was declining in Europe after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], this was also the case in Spain for like reasons, and due in particular to Mediterranean politics and to the repressive atmosphere created by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. Some [[Moriscos]] hesitated to show their knowledge of their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanelas, ''El morisco granadino Alonso del Castillo'' (Granada, 1965). Yet Alonso de Castillo (1520s-c.1610) himself and his work were esteemed, his being presented to the King, Philip II. (Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' (1970), at 13). However, it is also reported that among the less enlightened, efforts to understand the Arabic language or culture could be suspect, and on occasion Arabic books were burned. This was at a time when [[Barbary pirate|raiders from the Barbary states]] might land on the coast of Spain seeking captives for ransom or to sell into slavery. Meanwhile, Spanish and Ottoman fleets might be at sea, in a long struggle for control of the Mediterranean.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-18th century a new phase of Arabism arose in Spain. Later, in the era of the [[Generation of '98|Generación del 98]] Spanish Arabism began to produce widely recognized studies, and thus regained its prominence, particularly regarding such Arabists as [[Miguel Asín Palacios]] (1871–1944), and [[Emilio García Gómez]] (1905–1995), as well as many others.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' (Leiden: E.J.Brill 1970), at Chapter VII, pages 174-195, for Asín; at Chapter VIII, pages 202-219, for García Gómez.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arabists elsewhere in Europe==

In [[England]], [[Robert of Chester]] translated many books from Arabic into Latin during the 12th Century, including works from scholars such as [[Abu Musa Jabir Ibn Hayyan]] and [[Al-Khwarizmi]]. The Adams Professorship in the Arabic language was established at [[Cambridge University]] in England in July 1632. The [[Laudian Professorship in Arabic]] was established at [[Oxford University]] in 1636.

[[Italy]], [[France]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]]  have enjoyed a long and fruitful involvement in the study of the Arabic language and Arab cultures, as well of Islam, with scholars like [[Levinus Warner]] and [[Joseph Scaliger]]. Many other European countries have also produced scholars who have made notable contributions to the study of the Arabs and Arabic cultures, including [[Sweden]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], [[Scotland]], [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], [[Belgium]], and [[Russia]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Richard Francis Burton===

[[Richard Francis Burton]] entered [[Trinity College, Oxford]] in autumn 1840, after his family had travelled extensively in Europe (he spoke English, French and Italian). His studies at Oxford included falconry and Arabic.

Burton's time in the Pakistani province of [[Sindh]] prepared him well for the transgressive pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] and  [[Medina]] that he undertook in 1853 (he was not a Muslim and non-Muslims are forbidden to enter these holy cities). Seven years in Pakistan had given Burton a familiarity with the customs and behaviour of Muslims. This journey made Burton famous. He had planned it whilst travelling disguised among the Muslims of Sindh, and had laboriously prepared for the ordeal by study and practice (including having himself [[circumcision|circumcised]] to further lower the risk of being discovered).

Although Burton was not the first non-Muslim European to make the [[Hajj]] (that distinction belonging to [[Ludovico di Barthema]] in 1503), his pilgrimage is the most famous and the best documented of the time. He adopted various disguises, including that of a [[Pashtun people|Pathan]], to account for any oddities in speech, but he still had to master intricate Islamic ritual, and the minutiae of Eastern manners and etiquette. Burton's trek to Mecca was quite dangerous and his caravan was attacked by bandits (a common experience at the time). As he put it, although "...neither Koran or Sultan enjoin the death of Jew or Christian intruding within the columns that note the sanctuary limits, nothing could save a European detected by the populace, or one who after pilgrimage declared himself an unbeliever."  The pilgrimage entitled him to the title of ''[[Hajji]]'' and to wear a green turban. Burton's own account of his journey is given in ''[[Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al Madinah and Meccah]]'' (1855).

===Lady Hester Stanhope===

[[Lady Hester Stanhope]], after the death of [[British Prime Minister]] [[William Pitt the Younger]], to whom she acted as hostess, took up a life of travel.  She spent most of her life in the [[Middle East]] and was accepted as Queen of the [[Bedouin]].

===Gertrude Bell===

[[Gertrude Bell]], was an English writer, traveller, political officer, administrator, archaeologist and spy. She played a major role in establishing and helping administer the modern state of Iraq.

===St John Philby===

[[St John Philby]] was a British colonial office intelligence officer and [[Ibn Sa'ud|King Ibn Sa'ud]] of Saudi Arabia's chief adviser in dealing with the British Empire and Western oil powers

===Hans Wehr===

[[Hans Wehr]] (1909–1981) was a German Arabist, professor at the [[University of Münster]] from 1957–1974. Wehr published the ''Arabisches Wörterbuch'' (1952), which was later published in an English edition as ''A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic'', edited by J. Milton Cowan. As part of this dictionary, Wehr created a [[transliteration of Arabic|transliteration scheme]]  to represent the [[Arabic alphabet]].

==Arabists in the Middle East==
Some notable Arabists from the Middle East worth mentioning are [[Haim Zafrani]] in Morocco, [[Ahmad Zaki Pasha]] in Egypt, [[Tarif Khalidi]] in Lebanon, [[Zvi Elpeleg]] in Israel, [[Mehmet Hakkı Suçin]] in Turkey and [[William Duff (Arabist)|William Duff]].&lt;ref name="Bill Duff"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/william-duff-banker-whose-expertise-helped-transform-dubai-into-a-financial-powerhouse-and-a-major-force-in-the-arab-world-9190920.html | title=Bill Duff | publisher=Independent | date=13 March 2014 | accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20649">Since 1977, the international [[Bahá'í]] community has established several '''radio stations''' worldwide, particularly in the [[Americas]]. Programmes may include local news, music, topics related to  socio-economic and community development, educational programmes focusing on [[indigenous language]] and culture, and Bahá'í introductory and deepening material.&lt;ref name="Smith-siyah"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= radio; radio stations |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 287–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the 1960s there has been interest in mass media to promote and support development projects. This was followed by a view that the service of the community was through the participation of the community and spread of information. A series of [[UNESCO]] conferences lead to advancing the issues until in 1978 a conference was held in Ecuador.&lt;ref name="Kurt"&gt;{{Cite book

The Bahá'í Radio project in [[Ecuador]] served as a means to study the process of the two trends by setting up a community radio station of the community for the community - and may have been the first such project in all Latin America aimed at serving the ''campesinos'' as its primary purpose with development oriented programming.&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; It mixed national music forms with public service features (lost and found, messages to individuals, official communications, but looking to develop more.) The project was studied through faculty from [[Northwestern University]] from 1980–1982, and briefly in 1983, and reviewed Bahá'í Radio projects in Peru and Bolivia as well and resulted in a PhD by Kurt John Hein in 1985 following which he took up service at [[WLGI]] Radio Bahá'í.

===Ecuador===
Bahá'í Radio in Ecuador evolved as a way to serve the thousands of converts in the late 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; A native of [[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]], Ecuador, and chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly investigated using radio as a tool for spreading the religion and serving the newly forming communities. In early 1973 Raul Pavon leased Radio Turismo station and initiated fourteen hours of daily broadcasts. None involved had backgrounding in running a radio station. Initial success was based on playing local and national music genre. However the lease was rescinded and Bahá'í programing was limited to 2 hrs a day while the successful aspect of the programming was carried on. In July 1973 the national assembly added the goal of a radio station to its budget and a committee to create programing. Programming was developed and aired in eight cities between 15 minute segments up to hour-long bilingual (Spanish-[[Quichua]]) programs of [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í prayers]], and drawing from [[Bahá'í literature]] as well as information of its world-wide community. In 1975 training workshops were organized for scriptwriters. Other trainings continued in 1976. By 1976 the committee had produced 1286 hours of programming at a cost of approximately $2000 as well as documentation to support sister projects. Meanwhile, progress in getting a radio station began in 1975 when the aim was develop a [[short-wave]] radio station to serve all of Ecuador. The government lost the first submission for a license and the second was rejected. In 1976 revised the request by asking for a low-power [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] radio station which was finally granted in 1977 – noting that the government imposed a requirement that the station had to be ready for testing in 90 days from the beginning of construction - the final date to be up and broadcasting turned out to be October 27. Land was bought, a generator put in place, construction of buildings and equipment was gathered or fabricated on the spot. With voluntary services the antenna was raised at a cost of about $900. HCRN-1, Radio Bahá'í del Ecuador, 1420&amp;nbsp;kHz, did their first test transmission on October 12 with 20 watts of power. Full-time programming (6 hrs/day) began December 12. There were challenges of coordination and staffing to overcome. Outside trainers or professional staff were able to come in 1977, 1978, and 1980. A Commission was developed typically including a body composed of an indigenous person, a "white" person, technical experts, senior Bahá'ís and a veteran of the station, with a balance of majority of local people while also one member to be literate and capable of dealing with the administration of the commission.

It wasn't until 1981 that a suitable director was able to take up service by combining the qualities of being a Bahá'í, an experienced radio professional, and an Ecuadoran and able to volunteer.&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; With regular feedback from experienced institutions operating out of the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] progress was maintained and Dr. [[David Ruhe]], then a member of the [[Universal House of Justice]] visited in 1980 and acted as liaison between the radio station and the Audio-Visual Department at the Bahá'í administrative offices. In 1980 almost the entire staff traveled to [[Peru]] to make extensive presentations to the international Bahá'í media conference in [[Puno]] where the second Bahá'í Radio station would be set up. In 1981 Marcelo Quinteros was appointed as the executive director of Radio Bahá'í Ecuador after essentially rising in place while serving at the station for the prior six years. Quinteros originally became involved with the station as a younger brother of a broadcaster who had quit service at Radio Turismo after the way the Bahá'ís had been broken from their lease and in addition to Quinteros six other indigenous had systematically begun to serve at the station as full-time staff as well as larger numbers of part-time staff amounting to some 200 persons including indigenous youth in the first four years of the operation of the station. Indigenous staff were able to conduct workshops for other indigenous staff, in Spanish and Quichua, for the first time in 1981. Staff for projects in Bolivia, Chile and Peru participated in successive training and Ecuadoran staff traveled to Peru and Bolivia to assist in those projects. The Commission wrote to the Chilean Bahá'ís about the development of their radio station that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most important and indispensable thing is to maintain a happy, loving, spirited team-family. Try to have as high a percentage as possible of your staff native. At least 75%. It is far better to let a native do something wrong than not to give him the opportunity by having a foreigner do it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1983 training of staff at Radio Bahá'í Ecuador was almost entirely in the hands of indigenous staff.&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; There has also been training at the [[Amoz Gibson Training Center]] for Bahá'í Media in Puerto Rico operated by CIRBAL ([[Centro para Intercambio Radiofonico Bahá'í de America Latina]].) About 1983 the station was operating 15hrs/day on AM and 4 hrs per day on short-wave and was the dominant cost of the National Spiritual Assembly of Ecuador even though most of its staff are volunteers who receive only a small stipend. Office are in Otavalo and linked with the broadcast cite by microwave links. In addition to offices and studios the main cite houses a community garden plot, and a [[chosas]] style building as its meeting hall and hosts regional conferences as well. The main AM broadcast has evolved to 1&amp;nbsp;kilowatt at 1240&amp;nbsp;kHz in 1983. The second site maintained for the station is its short-wave broadcast facilities near [[El Cajas]]. A furniture store run by non-Bahá'ís acts as the [[Cayambe (canton)|Cayambe]] regional offices for locals to drop off news and requests for airing on the station.

The basic programming pattern was 80% local or national music favored by the indigenous population and 20% talking.&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt;  The music portion presented songs reviewed for content: aimed for the campesinos or not, appropriate for the time played, dignified, harmonious one song to the next, popularity, and explicitly incorporating  new releases. Programming changes included discontinuing music viewed as raucous. Instead the station broadcast messages inviting local musicians and groups to be recorded. In less than one year 30 or 40 such groups came forward however the majority of songs were devoted to drinking and infidelity. Instead music gathered from the wider region, and from music festivals, was emphasized. Younger "white" youth working at the station wanted to incorporate [[pop music]]. Instead a process of moods was emphasized – after morning prayers the music selections were a little sad or sentimental to create a meditative mood, then happy music to inspire people to leave for work upbeat, then in the afternoon music reflecting on family, nostalgia for the home. Initially the talking programming was simple recitation of the [[Bahá'í literature]] but by 1981 talking programming included coverage of development projects elsewhere Since its inception the religion has had involvement in [[Socio-economic development (Bahá'í)|socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Momen  | first = Moojan  | title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran  | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith"  | publisher = Bahai-library.com  | date =   | url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon  | first = Geeta Gandhi | title  = Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | url =http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory"/&gt; The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 |  url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988|volume = 19 | journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the [[Bahá'í teachings]], in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In Ecuador the talking programing began to cover news, helping society in a number of ways, and religious programming.

News programming deliberately covered only local news unless the government required coverage of particular events.&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; Coverage avoided presenting political advertising. In 1978-9 25 reports of lost children resulted in 24 recovered children. The remaining child had been murdered and the station hosted services for the child. A wide range of organizations brought news releases to the station - associations of artisans, cooperatives, firefighters, primary and secondary schools, etc. Lost animals and livestock would be delivered to the station and wait for their owners to come. Outbreaks of diseased would be responded to with informational programming. Programming informing the citizens of the availability of assistance in getting national ID cards for illiterate overwhelmed the local office - this campaign of creating documentation was noted as one of the most successful in Ecuador.

An attempt was made to bridge the informational releases from the government and the experience of the campesinos - latrines had been dug but the campesinos felt they were too valuable to hold excrement.&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; Through a grant from the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada and the Canadian International Development Agency staff were hired and programming developed to bring feedback from the campesinos to government ministries especially in agriculture. Using a mobile van they interviewed farmers and ministry representatives responding. Imported materials in Spanish were translated into Quichua overcoming problems of language, accent, vocabulary, and format (monologues vs dialogs.) Broader programming was developed in Quichua devoted to cultural program including folklore, festivals, crafts, child-care, nutrition, first aid, hygiene, etc.

Religious programming coverage of [[Nineteen Day Feasts]] and Holy Days.&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; In April programs included guidance on election procedures for Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]]. And there were devotional and proclamation programing including historical overviews of the [[Bahá'í Faith]].

Extended coverage of public affairs was undertaken of various kinds.&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; At one point Otavalo was officially raised in status to a city - various organizations developed special programing for the event.  Various schools produced shows, as well as the local Anthropological Institute. The formal session of the municipal council was recorded and aired. There were other events covered as well: basketball championships, new programs started at a local training school. An annual music festival started with the founding of the radio station. The first annual celebration attracted some 600 people in 1977. By 1979 2000 people attended. In 1980 the festival was extended to three days to include elimination rounds in contests between musicians. In 1981 there were six rounds elimination rounds and the rounds were then decimated to the area villages rather than at the station itself and included visiting groups from Peru, Bolivia and Chile. A children's festival was also initiated. In 1979 75 children performed in front of 1000 people. In 1982, 4000 people attended.

==Panama==
Similar to the development in Ecuador, the Guaymi Cultural Center in [[Panama]], for example, operates a radio station, holds annual music and dance festivals, an annual children's festival, regional women's' conferences, regular consultations where Guaymi and other indigenous people can consult about their future, and other meetings. It provides training for teachers of the rural secondary curriculum and for adult literacy instructors, assists eleven village schools, and supports local Bahá'í communities in the area by disseminating information on health care, farming, and other development topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hansen | first = Holly | title = Overview of Bahá'í Social and Economic Development | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = 1992-93 | pages = 229–245 | publisher = Bahá'í International Community | year = 1993 | url = http://info.bahai.org/article-1-8-1-6.html | accessdate = 2010-06-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080411185732/http://info.bahai.org/article-1-8-1-6.html# | archive-date = 2008-04-11 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[San Francisco Giants]] drafted Bond in the 24th round of the [[2007 MLB Draft]]. Some say the selection was a mistake, as the Giants meant to select [[Casey Bond]].

{{Particular churches sui iuris}}{{Catholic Church sidebar}}
A '''particular church''' ({{lang-la|ecclesia particularis}}) is an ecclesiastical community of faithful headed by a [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] (or [[Hierarchy of the Catholic Church#Equivalents of diocesan bishops in law|equivalent]]), as defined by [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]] and [[Catholic ecclesiology|ecclesiology]]. A '''liturgical rite''' depends on the bishop, i.e. the particular church.

Thus, though closely related, in this context "church" refers to the institution, and "rite" to its practices. There are two kinds of particular churches:
* An '''autonomous particular church ''[[sui iuris]]''''': an aggregation of particular churches with shared, distinctive [[Catholic liturgy|liturgical]], [[Catholic spirituality|spiritual]], [[Catholic theology|theological]], and [[Catholic canon law|canonical]] emphases and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_orientalium-ecclesiarum_en.html |title=Orientalium Ecclesiarum |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest such autonomous particular church is the [[Latin Church]], while the other 23 are referred to collectively as the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], some of which are headed by bishops who have the title and rank of [[Patriarch]] or [[Major Archbishop]]. In this context the descriptors ''autonomous'' ({{Lang-el|αὐτόνομος|translit=autónomos}}) and ''sui iuris'' ([[Latin]]) are synonymous, each meaning "of its own law".
* A '''local particular church''': a [[diocese]] (or [[eparchy]]) headed by a bishop (or equivalent), typically collected in a [[national polity]] under an [[episcopal conference]]. However, there are also other forms, including [[territorial abbey|territorial abbacies]], [[apostolic vicariate]]s, [[apostolic prefect]]ures, [[military ordinariate]]s, [[personal ordinariate]]s, and [[personal prelature]]s.{{refn|Particular Churches, in which and from which the one and only Catholic Church exists, are principally dioceses. Unless the contrary is clear, the following are equivalent to a diocese: a territorial prelature, a territorial abbacy, a vicariate apostolic, a prefecture apostolic and a permanently established apostolic administration.

{{main|Catholic ecclesiology}}
{{improve|reason=Simplify, merge redundant information, assert priority importance in lead paragraphs.|date=March 2017}}

In [[Catholic ecclesiology]], a [[Christian church|church]] is an assembly of the [[Faithful (baptized Catholic)|faithful]], hierarchically ordered, both in the entire world (the [[Catholic Church|Catholic Church)]], or in a certain territory (a particular church). To be a [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]] (a sign) of the [[Mystical Body of Christ]] in the world, a church must have both a head and members ([[Epistle to the Colossians|Col. 1:18]]).&lt;ref name="Catholic Culture Church Definition"&gt;{{cite web | work=CatholicCulture.org | url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=32533| title=Catholic Culture Church Definition | accessdate= 2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sacramental sign of [[Christ]] the head is the sacred [[hierarchy]] – the [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]], [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] and [[deacons]].&lt;ref name="CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Hierarchy"&gt;{{cite web | work=NewAdvent.org |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07322c.htm| title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Hierarchy | accessdate= 2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hierarchy of the Catholic Church"&gt;{{cite web | work=Catholic-Hierarchy.org | url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/| title=The Hierarchy of the Catholic Church | accessdate= 2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it is the local bishop, with his priests and deacons gathered around and assisting him in his office of teaching, sanctifying and governing ([[Gospel of Matthew|Mt. 28:19–20]]; [[Epistle to Titus|Titus 1:4–9]]). Thus, the church is fully present sacramentally (by way of a sign) wherever there is a sign of Christ the head, a bishop and those who assist him, and a sign of Christ's body, Christian faithful.&lt;ref name="CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Mystical Body of the Church"&gt;{{cite web | work=NewAdvent.org | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10663a.htm| title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Mystical Body of the Church | accessdate= 2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[diocese]] is therefore considered a [[particular church]].&lt;ref name="CATHOLIC RITES AND CHURCHES"&gt;{{cite web | work=EWTN | url=http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/catholic_rites_and_churches.htm| title=CATHOLIC RITES AND CHURCHES | accessdate= 2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the worldwide level, the sign of Christ the head is the [[Pope]], and, to be Catholic, particular churches, whether local churches or autonomous ritual churches, must be in communion with this sign of Christ the head,&lt;ref name="Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on some aspects of the Church understood as communion"&gt;{{cite web | work=Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger | url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_28051992_communionis-notio_en.html| title= Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on some aspects of the Church understood as communion | accessdate= 2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this [[full communion]] with [[Saint Peter]] and his successors the church becomes a universal sacrament of [[Christian soteriology|salvation]] to the [[end of the age]] ([[Mt. 28:20]]).&lt;ref name="CATHOLIC RITES AND CHURCHES"/&gt;

The word "church" is applied to the Catholic Church as a whole, which is seen as a single church: the multitude of peoples and cultures within the church, and the great diversity of gifts, offices, conditions and ways of life of its members, are not opposed to the church's unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P29.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 814 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1975-12-14 |accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense of "church", the list of churches in the Catholic Church has only one member, the [[Catholic Church]] itself (comprising Roman and Eastern Churches).

Within the Catholic Church there are local particular churches, of which dioceses are the most familiar form. Other forms include [[territorial abbot|territorial abbacies]], [[apostolic vicariate]]s and [[apostolic prefecture]]s. The [[Code of Canon Law]] states: "Particular Churches, in which and from which the one and only Catholic Church exists, are principally dioceses. Unless the contrary is clear, the following are equivalent to a diocese: a territorial prelature, a territorial abbacy, a vicariate apostolic, a prefecture apostolic and a permanently established apostolic administration."&lt;ref name="Canon 368"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1B.HTM#N |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 368 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of Catholic dioceses, of which on 31 December 2011 there were 2,834,&lt;ref name="sees"&gt;Vatican, ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' 2012, p. 1142.&lt;/ref&gt; is given at ''[[List of Catholic dioceses (alphabetical)]]''.

Within the Catholic Church there are also aggregations of local particular churches that share a specific liturgical, theological, spiritual, and [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]] heritage, distinguished from other heritages on the basis of cultural and historical circumstances. These are known as autonomous ("[[sui iuris|''sui iuris'']]") churches. The 1990 [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]] defines such a church as follows: "A group of Christ's faithful hierarchically linked in accordance with law and given express or tacit recognition by the supreme authority of the Church is in this Code called an autonomous Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_II_ |title=Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 27 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 24 such autonomous Catholic churches: One [[Latin Church]] (i.e., ''Western'') and 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]", a distinction by now more historical than geographical. Although each of them has its own specific heritage, they are all in full communion with the Pope in [[Rome]].

Unlike "families" or "federations" of churches formed through the grant of mutual recognition by distinct ecclesial bodies,&lt;ref&gt;Also unlike the situation of those countries within the [[Commonwealth]] that consider the [[British monarch]] to be their head of state, but are nonetheless fully independent and quite distinct states, not just one state.&lt;/ref&gt; the Catholic Church considers itself a single church ("[[full communion]], "one Body") composed of a multitude of particular churches, each of which, as stated, is an embodiment of the fullness of the one Catholic Church. For the particular churches within the Catholic Church, whether autonomous ritual churches (e.g., [[Coptic Catholic Church]], [[Melkite Catholic Church]], [[Armenian Catholic Church]], etc.) or dioceses (e.g., [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham|Archdiocese of Birmingham]], [[Archdiocese of Chicago]], etc.), are seen as not simply branches, divisions or sections of a larger body. Theologically, each is considered to be the embodiment in a particular place or for a particular community of the one, whole Catholic Church. "It is in these and formed out of them that the one and unique Catholic Church exists."&lt;ref&gt;Second Vatican Council, Dogmatic Decree on the Church ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html 23]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The particular Churches, insofar as they are'' 'part of the one Church of Christ' ''(Second Vatican Council: Decree ''Christus Dominus'', 6/c), have a special relationship of ''mutual interiority'' with the whole, that is, with the universal Church, because in every particular Church'' 'the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church of Christ is truly present and active' ''(Second Vatican Council: Decree ''Christus Dominus'', 11/a). For this reason, ''the universal Church cannot be conceived as the sum of the particular Churches, or as a federation of particular Churches''. It is not the result of the communion of the Churches, but, in its essential mystery, it is a reality ''ontologically'' and ''temporally'' prior to every ''individual'' particular Church" ([http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_28051992_communionis-notio_en.html ''Communionis notio'', 9]).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Particular churches ''sui iuris'' ===
{{Main articles|Particular church|Church sui iuris|Latin Church|Eastern Catholic Churches}}

There are 24 autonomous churches: one [[Latin Church]] and twenty-three [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], a distinction by now more historical than geographical. The term ''sui iuris'' means, literally, "of its own law", or self-governing. Although all of the particular churches espouse the same beliefs and faith, their distinction lies in their varied expression of that faith through their traditions, disciplines, and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]. All are in communion with the [[Holy See]].

For this kind of particular church, the 1983 ''Code of Canon Law'' uses the unambiguous phrase "autonomous ritual Church" ({{Lang-la|Ecclesia ritualis sui iuris|links=no}}). The 1990 ''[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]]'', which is concerned principally with what the [[Second Vatican Council]] called "particular Churches or rites", shortened this to "autonomous Church" ({{Lang-la|Ecclesia sui iuris|links=no}}).&lt;ref&gt;Canon 27, quote: "A group of Christ's faithful hierarchically linked in accordance with law and given express or tacit recognition by the supreme authority of the Church is in this Code called an autonomous Church."&lt;/ref&gt;{{OR|date=February 2016}}{{Failed verification|date=February 2016}}

===Local particular churches===
In [[Theology (Catholic Church)|Catholic teaching]], each [[diocese]] (Latin Church term) or [[eparchy]] (Eastern term) is also a local or particular church, though it lacks the autonomy of the autonomous churches described above:

{{quote|A diocese is a section of the People of God entrusted to a bishop to be guided by him with the assistance of his clergy so that, loyal to its pastor and formed by him into one community in the Holy Spirit through the Gospel and the Eucharist, it constitutes one particular church in which the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church of Christ is truly present and active.&lt;ref&gt;Second Vatican Council, Decree on the Pastoral Office of Bishops in the Church ''[[Christus Dominus]]'',[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19651028_christus-dominus_en.html 11]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[1983 Code of Canon Law]]'', which is concerned with the Latin Church alone and so with only one ''autonomous'' particular church, uses the term "particular Church" only in the sense of "local Church", as in its Canon 373:

{{quote|It is within the competence of the supreme authority alone to establish particular Churches; once they are lawfully established, the law itself gives them juridical personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1B.HTM#N |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 373 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The standard form of these local or particular churches, each of which is headed by a [[bishop]], is called a [[diocese]] in the Latin Church and an [[eparchy]] in the Eastern churches. At the end of 2011, the total number of all these jurisdictional areas (or "sees") was 2,834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Annuario Pontificio]] (Pontifical Yearbook) |author=Central Statistics Office |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |date=March 2012 |isbn=978-88-209-8722-0|page = 1142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Local particular church of Rome====
{{main|Holy See|Diocese of Rome}}
The [[Holy See]], the [[Diocese of Rome]], is seen as the central local church. The [[Bishop of Rome|bishop]], the [[Pope]], is considered to be, in a unique sense, the successor of [[Saint Peter]], the chief (or "prince") of the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]]. Quoting the Second Vatican Council's document ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' states: "The Pope, Bishop of Rome and Peter's successor, 'is the perpetual and visible source and foundation of the unity both of the bishops and of the whole company of the faithful.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', [http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt3art9p4.htm# 882]&lt;/ref&gt;

All the Catholic particular churches, whether Latin or Eastern, local or autonomous—are by definition in [[Communion with Rome|full communion]] with the [[Holy See of Rome]].

== Rites ==
The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches defines "rite" as follows: "Rite is the liturgical, theological, spiritual and disciplinary heritage, distinguished according to peoples' culture and historical circumstances, that finds expression in each autonomous church's way of living the faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_II_ |title=Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 28 §1 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As thus defined, "rite" concerns not only a people's [[liturgy]] (manner of worship), but also its [[theology]] (understanding of doctrine), [[spirituality]] (prayer and devotion), and discipline (canon law).

In this sense of the word "rite", the list of rites within the Catholic Church is identical with that of the autonomous churches, each of which has its own heritage, which distinguishes that church from others, and membership of a church involves participation in its liturgical, theological, spiritual and disciplinary heritage. However, "church" refers to the people, and "rite" to their heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gvZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=rite+%22code+of+canons%22&amp;dq=rite+%22code+of+canons%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VwpdTZmUG8qXhQfI0sSqCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgy |first=Lonappan |last=Arangassery |title=A Handbook on Catholic Eastern Churches |year=1999 |page=52 |accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches states that the rites with which it is concerned (but which it does not list) spring from the following five traditions: [[Early centers of Christianity#Alexandria|Alexandrian]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antiochian]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Armenia|Armenian]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Persia and Central Asia|Chaldean]], and [[Church of Constantinople#"The Great Church of Christ"|Constantinopolitan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_II_ |title=Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 28 §2 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it covers only Eastern Catholic churches and rites, it does not mention those of Western ([[Latin Church|Latin]]) tradition.

The word "rite" is sometimes used with reference only to liturgy, ignoring the theological, spiritual and disciplinary elements in the heritage of the churches. In this sense, "rite" has been defined as "the whole complex of the (liturgical) services of any Church or group of Churches".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Griffin |first=Patrick | year=1912 | title=Rites |  url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13064b.htm| work=Catholic Encyclopedia | publisher=New York: Robert Appleton Company | accessdate= 2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between "rites" in this exclusively liturgical sense and the autonomous churches there is no strict correspondence, such as there is when "rite" is understood as in the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. The 14 autonomous churches of Byzantine tradition have a single liturgical rite, but vary mainly in liturgical language, while on the contrary the single [[Latin Church]] has several distinct [[Latin liturgical rites|liturgical rites]], whose universal main form, the [[Roman Rite]], is practised in Latin or in the local vernacular).

[[File:Portuguese map of CHT.jpg|thumb|Portuguese map of Chittagong Hill Tracts. ''Chacomas'' on the Eastern bank of the river Karnaphuli and Arracan (present [[Rakhine State]] of [[Myanmar]]) can be seen on the extreme right]]

The '''Chakma people''' (also called '''Changma people''') are an [[ethnic group]] closely related to the [[Daingnet people]] who are distributed throughout [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Tripura]], [[Assam]], [[Mizoram]], [[Meghalaya]] and [[West Bengal]] of India and in [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] of [[Bangladesh]]. Today, the geographic distribution of Chakmas is spread across Bangladesh and parts of [[Northeast India|northeastern India]], [[Rakhine State|western]] [[Burma]], and diaspora communities in [[Yunnan]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Australia]].

The Chakmas are one of the indigenous [[Jumma people]]s of the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. They are the largest ethnic group there and make up half of the region's population. The Chakmas are divided into 46 [[Clan|clans]] or ''Gozas''. They have their own [[Chakma language|language]], customs and [[culture]], and practice [[Theravada Buddhism]]. The community is headed by the [[Chakma Raja]].

== Etymology ==

The name ''Chakma'' derives from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Sakthiman,'' which means beholder of power.&lt;ref name=Gutman&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutman|first=Pamela|title=Ancient Arakan
|year=1976|publisher=Australian National University Press|location=|isbn=|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name was given to Chakmas by one of the Burmese kings during the [[Bagan]] era. Burmese kings hired Chakmas as ministers, advisers, and translators of Buddhist [[Pali]] texts. As employees of the king, the Chakmas wielded power in Burmese court disproportionate to their number. The Burmese people still refer to Chakmas as ''Sak'' or ''Thit,'' which are shortened and corrupted forms of ''Sakthiman''. At one stage, the accepted name of the tribe was ''Sakma''. Later, it was further altered to ''Chakma''.&lt;ref name=Buchanan&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Francis|title=Francis Buchanan in Southeast Bengal
|year=1992|publisher=Dhaka University Press|location=|isbn=978-984-05-1192-1|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic origins==

Chakmas are [[Tibeto-Burman]], and are thus closely related to tribes in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]]. The Chakmas are believed to be originally from greater [[Arakan State|Arakan]] Yoma North, presently [[Chin State]],  who later on immigrated to [[Bangladesh]] in the fifteenth century, settling in the [[Cox's Bazar District]], the [[Korpos Mohol]] area, and in the Indian states of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Tripura]] and [[Mizoram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genesis of Indigenous Chakma Buddhists and Their Pulverization Worldwide|last=S.

===Genetics===
The Chakma possess strong genetic affinities to [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] groups in [[Northeast India]] and to East Asian populations. They also have high frequencies of mainland Indian genetic ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3794028 | pmid=24130682 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075064 | volume=8 | issue=10 | title=Genetic structure of Tibeto-Burman populations of Bangladesh: evaluating the gene flow along the sides of Bay-of-Bengal | journal=PLoS One | page=e75064 | author=Gazi NN, Tamang R, Singh VK, Ferdous A, Pathak AK, Singh M, Anugula S, Veeraiah P, Kadarkaraisamy S, Yadav BK, Reddy AG, Rani DS, Qadri SS, Singh L, Chaubey G, Thangaraj K| year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{copyedit|date=September 2018}}

The [[Arakanese people|Arakanese]] referred to the Chakmas as ''Saks,'' ''Theks,'' ''or Thaikhs''. In 1546 CE, while the [[Arakanese]] king Meng Beng was engaged in a battle with the [[Burma|Burmese]], the ''Sak'' king attacked Northern Arakan Roma and occupied the Arakanese-controlled Chacomas of the Northern [[Arakan Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Arthur P.Phayre, Chief Commissioner of Burma|title=History of Burma|page=79|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/140606058/History-of-Burma-by-Sir-Arthur-P-Phayre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diego de Astor]] created a map of [[Bengal]], which was published as ''Descripção do Reino de Bengalla'' in the book ''Quarta decada da Asia'' (Fourth decade of Asia) by [[João de Barros]] in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogo.bnportugal.pt/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=N2J3194P78658.761543&amp;profile=bn&amp;uri=link=3100027~!7976891~!3100024~!3100022&amp;aspect=basic_search&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1&amp;source=~!bnp&amp;term=Descri%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20do%20Reino%20de%20Bengala&amp;index=ALTITLE|title=Descripção do Reino de Bengalla|first=Diego de|last=Astor|publisher=|accessdate=24 August 2016|via=catalogo.bnportugal.pt Library Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The map shows a place called ''Chacomas'' on the Eastern bank of the [[Karnaphuli|Karnaphuli River]] in what is now [[Chittagong|Chittagong, Bangladesh]], suggesting that the Chakmas inhabited this area during this time.

The [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] king Meng Rajagri (1593–1612) conquered these areas and addressed himself as the highest and most powerful king of Arakan, Chacomas and Bengal in a 1607 letter to a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] merchant named Philip de Brito Nicote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sugata Chakma|title=Parbattya Chattagramer Upajati O Sangskriti|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeat by the Arakanese, the Chakmas migrated to the present Chittagong Hill Tracts and founded their capital city Alekyangdong (present-day [[Ali Kadam Upazila|Alikadam]]). From Alekyangdong, they continued North and settled in the present-day [[Rangunia Upazila|Rangunia]], [[Raozan Upazila|Raozan]], and [[Fatikchhari Upazila|Fatikchari Upazilas]] of [[Chittagong District]].

In 1666, [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Governor of Bengal [[Shaista Khan]] defeated the Arakanese, conquered the Northern bank of [[Kaladan river]], and renamed it Islamabad.&lt;ref name="m1"&gt;Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2007).

The [[Mughals]] eventually demanded tribute from the Chakmas after a trade dispute developed between the two groups. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Saradindu Shekhar Chakma|title=Ethnic Cleansing in Chittagong Hill Tracts|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1713, the conflict was resolved, and a stable relationship developed between the Chakmas and the Mughals; the latter never demanded complete subjugation from the former. The Mughals also rewarded the Chakma king Shukdev Roy; he established a new capital in his own name, in an area still known as Shukbilash. Ruins of the royal palace and other historic buildings still exist. Subsequently, the capital was shifted to Rajanagar, [[Ranighat Palace|Ranirhat]], Rangunia Upazila, Chittagong District.

=== The East India Company ===

The Mughals signed a treaty with Jallal Khan, [[Raja]] of the Chakma, in 1715. While the Mughals controlled significant amounts of yam and cotton crops in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), its independence from the Mughals was recognized.

The British government also received payment from the Chakmas and recognized their kingdom as independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Earth Touch|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p7V-AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=pakistan+chakma+fought&amp;q=radcliffe+award|year=1998|publisher=Society for Environment &amp; Human Development|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CHT was guaranteed and delineated their own tribal preserve area by the treaties between the King of the Chakma and the British.

A war was waged from 1777 to 1789 between the [[East India Company]] and the Chakmas. In exchange for leaving the Chakmas as tributaries and giving them autonomy, the British received an oath from Jan Baksh Khan, king of all Chakmas in 1787.&lt;ref name="Minahan2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Minahan|title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups Around the World A-Z &amp;#91;4 Volumes&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZfnWCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA847&amp;dq=pakistan+jumma+fought#v=onepage&amp;q=pakistan%20jumma%20fought&amp;f=false|date=30 May 2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-07696-1|pages=847–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years after the [[Battle of Plassey]], [[Mir Qasim]], the new [[Nawab]] of [[Murshidabad]], rewarded the East India Company with Chittagong, [[Burdwan]] and [[Midnapur]]. On January 5, 1761, the company representative [[Harry Verelst (colonial governor)|Harry Verelst]] took charge of Chittagong from Subedar Mohammad Reza Khan. But the Chakma king Sher Doulat Khan, who was practically independent, though nominally paid tribute to the Mughals, didn't accept the [[hegemony]] of the Company and their demand of taxes at an enhanced rate. A protracted war started and continued until 1787. The East India Company launched four offensives against the Chakmas in 1770, 1780, 1782 and 1785. In 1785, the Company started peace negotiations with the Chakma king Jan Baksh Khan, son of Sher Doulat Khan. Later in 1787, the king accepted the sovereignty of the Company and agreed to pay 500 [[Maund]]s of cotton annually. The peace treaty was signed in [[Kolkata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Government of Bangladesh|title=The District Gazetteer of Chittagong Hill Tracts|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main provisions of the treaty between Governor-General [[Lord Cornwallis]] and the Chakma king were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Suniti Bhushan Qanungo |year=1998 |title=Chakma Resistance to British Domination 1772–1798 |location=Chittagong |publisher=Suniti Bhushan Qanungo |page=52 |oclc=54822598}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The East India Company recognised Jan Baksh Khan as the Raja of the Chakmas.
* It was agreed that the collection of revenue was the responsibility of the Raja.
* The British Government would preserve the tribal autonomy and migration from the plains would be restricted.
* Jan Baksh Khan was bound by the treaty to maintain peace in his territory.
* British troops would remain in the Chakma territory not to terrify the Chakmas but to protect the land from hostile tribes.
In 1829, Halhed, then Commissioner of Chittagong reaffirmed that:
{{quote| The hill tribes were not British subjects but merely tributaries and we recognized no right on our part to interfere with their internal arrangements. The near neighbourhood of a powerful and stable government naturally brought the Chief by degree under control and every leading chief paid to the Chittagong collector a certain tribute or yearly gifts. These sums were at first fluctuating in amount but gradually were brought to a specific and fixed limit, eventually taking the shape not as tribute but as revenue to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. P. Talukder |year=1988 |title=The Chakmas, Life and Struggle |publisher=Gian Publishing House |page=36 |isbn=978-81-212-0212-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jan Baksh Khan shifted his capital to a new place, naming it Rajanagar, near present-day [[Rangunia]]. After Jan Baksh's death in 1800, his son Tabbar Khan became king but died shortly thereafter. In 1802, Tabbar Khan's younger brother Jabbar Khan became king and ruled for ten years. After his death, his son Dharam Baksh Khan became king in 1812 and ruled until his death in 1832. Without any male heir there was chaos, and the government appointed Suklal Dewan as the Manager. [[Kalindi (rani)|Rani Kalindi]], widow of Dharam Baksh Khan, applied to the government to allow her to run state affairs. The government accepted her application, and in 1844 issued an order to that effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Biraj Mohan Dewan|title=Chakma Jatir Itibritto|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846, the annual revenue payable to the Company was refixed at 11,803.00[[Rs.]] Today, the Chakma people are predominantly followers of [[Theravada Buddhism]] due to 19th century reforms and institutionalization by [[Queen regnant|regent Queen]] [[Kalindi (rani)|Rani Kalindi]].

After the great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]] in 1857, the British Government assumed direct control of the administration of India from the East India Company along with the Chittagong Hill Tracts, which was not yet formally separated from Chittagong. But the territorial jurisdiction of the Chakma Raja was fixed by a proclamation dated 6th [[Shraavana]] 1170M.S (1763 CE) by the Company as "''All the hills from the [[Feni River|Feni river]] to the Sangoo and from Nizampur Road in Chittagong to the hills of Kooki Raja".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. P. Talukder |title=The Chakmas, Life and Struggle |publisher=Gian Publishing House |page=35 |isbn=978-81-212-0212-1|date=1988-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rani Kalindi's death in 1873, her grandson Harish Chandra became the Chakma Raja and was vested with the title [[Rao Bahadur|Roy Bahadur]].

=== British colonial rule ===

After the war with the English, the Chakmas became very weak militarily.

The [[Lushai]] used to make frequent murderous raids on the British subjects on the grounds that their hunting ground was converted to a tea garden by the British in Cacher, [[Noakhali]], [[Comilla]] and other neighbouring tracts under Rani Kalindi. They raided Chittagong Hill Tracts and the neighbouring tracts in 1847, 1848, 1859 and 1860.&lt;ref name="Saradindu Shekhar Chakma 29"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saradindu Shekhar Chakma|title=Ethnic Cleansing in Chittagong Hill Tracts|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, with a view to paying the necessary attention to the areas of the front areas experiencing repeated raids and to protecting the people from the aggression of the independent tribes living farther east but primarily to occupy the Chakma land, the Lieutenant Governor of [[Bengal]] recommended the removal of the hill tracts from the regulation district and the appointment of a superintendent over the tribes.
Both these recommendations were adopted by the act XXII in 1860, which came into effect on August 18 of that year.&lt;ref name="Saradindu Shekhar Chakma 29"/&gt; Thus, the Hill Tracts were separated from Chittagong district, a superintendent was appointed for Chittagong Hill Tracts, and its headquarters were established at Chandraghona. The hills in his charge were henceforth known by the name of the Hill Tracts of Chittagong. For the next few years, attention was directed to the preservation of peace on the frontier. In 1869, the headquarters were shifted to [[Rangamati Hill District|Rangamati]]. The official designation of the post of superintendent was changed to Deputy Commissioner and full control of all matters pertaining to both revenue and justice throughout the Hill Tracts was vested in his office.

The frontier situation put pressure on the Chakma chief to shift his capital, and ultimately in 1874, it was shifted from Rajanagar to Rangamati. At that time cotton was grown in Chittagong Hill Tracts and was important to the British for their mills. Therefore, effective control of Chittagong Hill Tracts was also important for them.

In 1881, the government decided to divide Chittagong Hill Tracts into [[Chakma Circle]], [[Bohmong Circle]], and [[Mong Circle]].

Each circle was headed by a chief.&lt;ref name="Saradindu Shekhar Chakma 30"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saradindu Shekhar Chakma|title=Ethnic Cleansing in Chittagong Hill Tracts|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chakma circle was headed by a Chakma, Bohmong circle by a Bohmong and the Burmese circle by a [[Hmong people|Mong]]. The Chakma circle was centrally located and inhabited mainly by the Chakmas, the Bohmong circle was under the rule of a Bohmong chief of Arakanese extraction, and the Mong circle was also inhabited by Arakanese speaking clans with a sprinkling of [[Tripura]] immigrants and headed by another ruler of Arakanese extraction. The reason for this division was that the British government was not in favour of the strong power of the Chakma Chief who held control over these hilly tribes. Further, the government was feeling increasingly concerned about the political and administrative affairs of these tracts. Hence, they wished to lay the foundation of administration in a restricted manner with the following basic objectives&lt;ref name="Saradindu Shekhar Chakma 30"/&gt;:
* To supervise the rule of the Chakma chief and also to curtail some of his powers.
* To protect British subjects from the [[Kuki people|Kuki]] (the name given to the Lushai by the British).
* To preserve peace in the frontier areas so that cotton could be grown and made available for their mills.

After the creation of a separate district and also the three circles, the [[Kuki people|Kuki]] (Lushai) threat to the Chittagong Hill Tracts and other adjoining areas did not stop. The [[Mara people|Shendus]], another tribe, made occasional raids in the Hill Tracts between 1865 and 1888 and killed many people including the massacre of Lt. Steward and his survey party. In 1872, 1,890 military offensives were launched simultaneously into [[Lushai Hills]] (Mizoram) from Chittagong district and Burma in collaboration with the governments of Bengal, [[Assam]] and Burma, and the whole of Kookie land was brought under British control.

Autonomous police forces were created from the Hill Tract tribes in 1881. Tribals complained to Britain after the Hill Tracts experienced attempts at penetration by lowlander Bengali Muslims.&lt;ref name="Minahan2002"/&gt;

On 1 April 1900, the South and the North Lushai Hills (then a part of Chittagong Hill Tracts) were merged to form the district of [[Assam]] province with headquarters at [[Aizawl]].&lt;ref&gt;The Weekly Kagoj, 9 May 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lushai hills]] are now the present day [[Mizoram]] state of India.

Later, the British through the Deputy Commissioner took over absolute power in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (including the Chakma circle) after implementation of the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts manual]]. The Chittagong Hill Tracts (Lushai Hills) were again designated an ''"Excluded Area"'' under the [[British India Act of 1935]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Saradindu Shekhar Chakma|title=Ethnic Cleansing in Chittagong Hill Tracts|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent state was demanded for the Chittagong Hill Tract by local tribes due to the fact that Bengalis and the tribals did not share a religion, language, or ethnicity, and they asked for their own independent area in the 1930s when the [[Indian independence movement|Indian national movement]] was launched. In the event of Indian independence, the tribals were guaranteed by Britain that the Chittagong Hill Tracts would be split off separately, since [[World War II]] was happening and the Japanese were attacking.&lt;ref name="Minahan2002"/&gt;

Like in India ''Tripura'' State, the Chakmas have lived in the modern state of Bangladesh much before it gained its independence. However, recent migrations of ethnic Bengalis into traditionally Chakma regions of Bangladesh have raised tensions in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Successive governments have dealt forcefully with Chakma uprisings, and finally ended the conflict with [[Chittagong Hill Tracts#History|The 1997 Peace Treaty]]. This forceful dealing and the construction of Kaptai Dam by then Pakistan government in Chakma areas submerged cultivable lands and displaced thousands, resulted in the migration of a large population of Chakmas into [[Diyun]] the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] of the present Indian Union during 1964-1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/851111/open-letter-dear-rajnath-singh-the-limited-citizenship-for-chakmas-is-too-little-too-late|title=chakma letter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1972, Prime Ministers of India and Bangladesh issued a joint statement by virtue of which the Government of India took a decision to confer citizenship on the Chakmas under Section 5(1)(a) of [[Indian nationality law|the Citizenship Act, 1955]] but the state of Arunachal Pradesh had reservations. Chakma was thus allowed to be rehabilitated under the decision of the Indian government. The Election Commission of India framed guidelines to enable Chakmas to have the right to vote by having their names enrolled in the electoral rolls of the constituency where they have been settled.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://onelawstreet.com/2015/09/supreme-court-asks-to-grant-indian-citizenship-rights-to-chakmas-and-hajongs-in-3-months/|title = Supreme Court orders to grant Indian citizenship rights to Chakmas and Hajongs in 3 months|date = 17 September 2015|accessdate = 25 September 2015|website = 1, Law Street|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are another 80,000 Chakmas in [[Rakhine state]] of [[Myanmar]]. The Chakmas in Myanmar are known as [[Daingnet people]].

In September 2015, Supreme Court of India passed a judgment directing the government of India and of Arunachal Pradesh to grant India citizenship rights to all the Chakmas holding that they could not be discriminated against any other Indian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Bengali related Indo-Aryan Chittagonian transformed the Changma Vaj language into Eastern-Indo Aryan from its Tibeto-Burman origins. The people themselves as classified as [[Mongoloid]]. Hinduism and Theravada Buddhism are the religions of the Chakma.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Now it is classified as Indo-Aryan.&lt;ref name="Policy1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Library of Congress. Office for Subject Cataloging Policy|title=Library of Congress Subject Headings|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aswHhUQG4okC&amp;pg=PA709&amp;dq=pakistan+chakma+bangladesh#v=onepage&amp;q=pakistan%20chakma%20bangladesh&amp;f=false|year=1990|publisher=Cataloging Distribution Service, Library of Congress|pages=709–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

The vast majority of the Chakma are followers of [[Theravada Buddhism]], a religion that they have been practicing for centuries.

Almost every Chakma village has a Buddhist Vihar (Kiyong). Buddhist priests or monks are called [[Bhikkhu|Bhikhus]]. They preside at religious festivals and ceremonies. The villagers support their monks with food, gifts, and offerings to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The Chakmas also worship [[Hindu deities]]. [[Lakshmi|Sri Mahalakshmi]], for example, is worshipped as the Goddess of the Harvest.

Chakmas offer the sacrifice of goats, chickens, or ducks to calm the spirits that are believed to bring fevers and disease. Even though animal sacrifice is against Buddhist beliefs, the Chakma Buddhist priests ignore the practice.

==Language==
{{main article|Chakma language}}

Originally speaking a language belonging to the [[Tibeto-Burman]] family, some of the Chakmas have been influenced by neighbouring [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]], an [[List of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern Indo-Aryan language]] closely related to [[Assamese language|Assamese]]. Many linguists now consider the modern Chakma language (known as ''Changma Vaj'' or ''Changma Hodha'') part of the Eastern Indo-Aryan language. Changma Vaj is written in its own script, the [[Chakma script]], also known as ''Ojhopath''. Chakma is written in an alphabet which allowing for its cursive form, is almost identical with the Khmer and the Lanna (Chiangmai) characters, which was formerly in use in [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]] and southern parts of [[Burma]].

==Culture==

[[File:Tourists Buying Chakma Handicrafts In Bandarban, 5 Dec, 2011.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Chakma [[handicrafts]] and fabrics are an attraction for many tourists in [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]].]]
The Chakmas are people with their own culture, folklore, literature and traditions. The Chakma women wear an ankle length cloth around the waist which is also called ''Phinon'' and also a ''Haadi'' wrapped above the waist as well as silver ornaments. The ''Phinon'' and the ''Haadi'' are colourfully handwoven with various designs. The design is first embroidered on a piece of cloth known as ''Alaam''. The first Bangladeshi Chakma language film, [[Mor Thengari|''Mor Thengari'']], was directed by Aung Rakhine and was banned by Bangladesh's Censor Board.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.melonfarmers.com/inap16a.htm|title=Bangladesh film banned because the censors could not speak a local dialect|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/opinion/how-kill-language-574225|title=How to Kill a Language|last=|first=|date=2016-02-18|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==

The most important festivals celebrated by the Chakmas are Bizu, Alphaloni, [[Buddha Purnima]] and Kathin Civar Dan.

Chakmas celebrate various Buddhist festivals. The most important is Buddha Purnima. This is the anniversary of three important events in Buddha's life—his birth, his attainment of [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and his death. It is observed on the full moon day of the month of [[Vaisakha]] (usually in May).

On this and other festival days, Chakmas put on their best clothes and visit the temple. There, they offer flowers to the image of Buddha, light candles, and listen to sermons from the priests. Alms (offerings) are given to the poor, and feasts are held for the priests.

The three-day festival known as Bishu, which coincides with the [[Pahela Baishakh|Bengali New Year's Day]], is celebrated with much enthusiasm. Houses are decorated with flowers, young children pay special attention to the elderly to win their blessings, and festive dishes are prepared for guests.

===Bizu===

Bizu is the most important socio-religious festival of the Chakma. This festival gave birth to the Bizu dance. The festival lasts for three days and begins one day before the last day of the month of [[Chaitra]], falling in the month of April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bizumela: Bizu 2011|url=http://bizumela.blogspot.com/2011/04/bizu-mela.html|accessdate=23 August 2013|date=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first day is known as ''Phool Bizu''. On this day, household items, clothes are cleaned and washed, food items are collected to give the house a new look with the veil of different flowers.
The second day is known as ''Mul Bizu''. This day starts with the bath in the river. People wear new clothes and make rounds of the village. Women wear ''phinon'' and ''Haadi'' while men wear ''silum'' and ''dhudi''. They also enjoy specially made vegetable curry known as "Pazon ton", different homemade sweets and take part in different traditional sports. The day ends with the Bizu dance.

The last day, which is known as ''Gojjepojje din'' involves the performances of different socio-religious activities.
In the context of its nature, some say that Bizu is a festival, which revolves around agricultural activities because it is celebrated in mid-April when the earth is just drenched with the first rain and the jum sowing is taken up. And it is believed that with the objective of getting a rich harvest, worship of the earth was arranged, which later on took the form of a festival. However, of late it has lost its agricultural character.

===Alphaloni===

Alphaloni is a most important day for Chakma people. During Alphaloni everyone takes a break from farming because it is harvest season. In Alphaloni all farmers take rest and also give rest to all animals, weapons of farmers. In this day they eat new food, fruits from jum (harvest), offer and share with each other. This day all people feel happy and enjoy with family, neighbors, relatives, etc. to offering new fruits from jum. It is a historical day for Chakma people; they have celebrated this festival for 2500 years.

It is an old tradition from the reign of King [[Śuddhodana]], father of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha (Buddha)]]. This is an old festival of 2500 years ago, when the prince Siddharta was meditating under the tree, on the other side had to celebrate plough festival (Alphaloni) their farmer parents and relatives, etc.

During that time he was practicing meditation and seeking an end to all suffering.

===Buddha Purnima===

It is celebrated on the full moon day in the month of [[Vaisakha]]. It encompasses the birth, enlightenment ([[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvāna]]), and passing away ([[Parinirvana|Parinirvāna]]) of Lord Buddha. On the day of the worship, devotees go to the monastery with ''Siyong'' (offerings of rice, vegetable and other fruits and confectionaries). The Buddhist priests known as ''Bhikkhu'' lead the devotees for the chanting of mantra composed in [[Pali]] in praise of the holy triple gem: the Buddha, the Dharma (his teachings), and the Sangha (his disciples). Apart from this, other practices such as lighting thousands of lamps and releasing ''Phanuch Batti'' (an auspicious lamp made of paper in the form of a balloon) are also done as and when possible.

==Food==

[[Bamboo shoot]] is a traditional food of the Chakma people. They call it "Bajchuri". [[Shrimp paste]] and [[Fish paste]] are their traditional ingredient of cooking. They call these, "Sidol".

The staple food of the Chakmas is rice, supplemented by millet, corn (maize), vegetables, and mustard. Vegetables include yams, pumpkins, melons, and cucumbers. Vegetables and fruit gathered from the forest may be added to the diet. Fish, poultry, and meat are eaten, despite the fact that many Buddhists are vegetarians.

Traditional diets have slowly been abandoned, as the Chakmas have been forced to flee their homeland. Some typical Chakma dishes include fish, vegetables, and spices stuffed into a length of bamboo and cooked in a low fire; foods wrapped in banana leaves and placed beside a fire; and eggs that are aged until they are rotten.

==Sports and games==

[[Kabaddi|Gudu hara]], or Ha-do-do, is a game played throughout the Chakma region. Two teams stand on either side of a central line. They take turns sending a player into opposing territory to touch as many people as he or she can during the space of one breath, while at the same time saying "Ha-do-do." If the player runs out of breath or is caught by his or her opponents, he or she is out. On the other hand, if the player successfully returns to his or her own territory, the players he or she has tagged must leave the game.

[[Ghilay Hara]] is a game that can be played between two teams or two individuals. A special type of seed called ''ghilay'' is used to play this game. ''Ghilay'' seeds are found and grown in wild forests of hills and are similar to bean seeds but bigger in size. When the time comes, the large beans dry out and the seeds known as ''ghilay'' are ready to be collected for use in the game.

Other pastimes include [[Nadeng Hara]], played with a spinning top, and various wrestling games. [[Potti Hara]] is a complex traditional game that is played by two teams. Due to how sophisticated its rules are, it's becoming less and less common.

These games are enjoyed by girls and boys alike, but in recent times their popularity among youth Chakma peoples has declined.

'''Communalism''' is a term used in [[South Asia]] to denote attempts to construct religious or ethnic identity, incite strife between people identified as different communities, and to stimulate [[communal violence]] between those groups.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Horowitz (1985), Ethnic Groups in Conflict, {{ISBN|978-0520053854}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from history, differences in beliefs, and tensions between the communities.&lt;ref name=Pandey&gt;{{cite book |last=Pandey | first = Gyanendra | title = The Construction of Communalism in Colonial North India | publisher = Oxford India  | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term communalism was constructed by the British colonial authorities as it wrestled to manage violence between religious, ethnic and disparate groups in its colonies, particularly Africa and South Asia, in early 20th century.&lt;ref name=gvk&gt;Gerry van Klinken, [http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_2/POLITICS%20AND%20GOVERNMENT%20Communal%20violence%20democratization%20in%20Indonesia%20%20small%20town%20wars.pdf Communal Violence and Democratization in Indonesia - Small Town Wars], {{ISBN|978-0-415-41713-6}}, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arafaat A.

Communalism is a significant social issue in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=Pandey/&gt;

==History==

The term came into use in early 20th century during the British colonial rule, where the rulers saw India divided into several communities and attempted to placate separate "communal" interests. The [[Hindu]] Mahasabh and the [[All-India Muslim League]] represented such communal interests, whereas [[Indian National Congress]] represented an overarching "nationalist" vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nehru, The Making of India|last = Akbar|first = M. J.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 1989|isbn = 9780140100839|location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the run up to independence in 1947, communalism and nationalism came to be competing ideologies and led to the division of British India into the Republics of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. The bloody [[Partition of India|Partition violence]] gave a clear sense to every one what communalism leads to, and it has since been frowned upon in India.

Communal conflicts between religious communities, especially [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]], have been a recurring occurrence in independent India, occasionally leading to serious inter-communal violence.

==Incidents of communal violence==
{{main|Religious violence in India|Caste-related violence in India|Terrorism in India}}
Examples of communalist violence, with strong motivations based on religious identity  include:
*the 1809–1811 Hindu-Muslim [[Lat Bhairo]] riots
*the 1921 [[Moplah Rebellion]]
*the 1931 Hindu-Muslim [[Benares]] riot
*the 1931 [[Cawnpore]] Riots

*the 1971 [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|Bangladesh genocide]], 3 million victims, 8 million Hindus displaced.
**Hindu areas in Bangladeshi cities suffered particularly heavy blows. ''Time'' magazine reported on 2 August 1971, "The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Pakistani military hatred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiatribune.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=2105&amp;Itemid=524 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109145345/http://www.indiatribune.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=2105&amp;Itemid=524 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 November 2013 | title=The Hindu genocide that Hindus and the world forgot | publisher=[[India Tribune]] | accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*the 1992 [[Bombay riots]] in Bombay more than 200,000 people (both Hindus and Muslims) fled the city or their homes during the time of the riots, 900–3000 people died.
*the 1992 December 2- Babri masjid demolition by Sangparivar and subsequent communal violence in various parts of India
*the 1998 [[Wandhama massacre]], 25 Hindu victims.
*the 1999 [[Graham Staines]] murder.
*the 2000 [[Chittisinghpura massacre]], 35 Sikhs killed.
*the 2002 [[Godhra Train Burning]], 58 Hindus killed.

*the 2002 [[Kaluchak massacre]], 31 Hindus killed.
*the 2002 [[Marad massacre]], 14 Hindu deaths – [[Indian Union Muslim League]] conspired and executed the [[massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/marad-report-slams-muslim-league/13497/ Marad report slams Muslim League] Indian Express, Sep 27 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

*the 2012 [[2012 Assam violence|Assam violence]], between Bodo Hindus and Bengali Muslim settlers 
Incidents of "communal violence" cannot clearly be separated by incidents of [[terrorism]]. "Communal violence" tends to refer to mob killings, while terrorism describes concerted attacks by small groups of militants (see [[definition of terrorism]]).

'''Damnazes''' ({{lang-ka|დამნაზე}}; {{lang-el|Δαμνάζης}}; died 522&lt;ref name="PLRE"&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1980|p=344}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a 6th-century king of [[Lazica]] (western [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), a contemporary of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] king of Iran [[Kavadh I]]. Damnazes, like other kings of [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] Lazica, are mentioned by the contemporary chronicles in the context of the rivalry between the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]] and Sassanid Iran in the [[Caucasus]].  

Damnazes is known to the Byzantine historian [[John Malalas]]&lt;ref&gt;Joh. Mal. 413.&lt;/ref&gt; as the father and predecessor of [[Tzath I of Lazica|Tzathius]], king of the Lazi. The anonymous ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]'' (''Chron. Pasch.'' s.a. 522) renders his name as ''Zamnaxes''.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt; According to a genealogical hypothesis by Professor [[Cyril Toumanoff]], Damnazes might have been a son of the Lazic king [[Gubazes I of Lazica|Gubazes I]], who is known to have had his son as co-ruler {{circa}} 456.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toumanoff|1980|pp=81–82}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Damnazes was a subject of the Sassanid king and, although ruling over a [[Christianity|Christian]] country, professed [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref name="Toumanoff-79"&gt;{{harvnb|Toumanoff|1980|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On his death, his son and successor, Tzathius, rejected an Iranian coronation and repaired to [[Constantinople]] to have his accession validated by the Byzantine emperor [[Justin I]].&lt;ref name="Toumanoff-79"/&gt;

'''Feminist Jewish ethics''' is an area of study in [[Jewish ethics]] and [[feminist philosophy]].

==Literature and key thinkers==

===Judith Plaskow===
{{main|Judith Plaskow}}

In her 1991 work, ''Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective'', Judith Plaskow discusses the experiences of Jewish women, within a modern framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plaskow|first=Judith|title=Standing Again at Sinai|year=1990|publisher=Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work focuses on the transformation Jewish tradition, to include and be influenced by a feminist lens. This theme of change is heavily carried throughout her writing on '''Feminist Jewish Ethics'''. She considers the ways in which feminist thought can utilize theology to include women within Jewish thinking and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plaskow|first=Judith|title=The Coming of Lilith: Essays on Feminism, Judaism, and Sexual Ethics.|year=2005|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Plaskow takes on a Feminist perspective in her analysis of Jewish tradition in order to provide a reinterpretation of theology and Jewish thought that best includes and validates the experiences of modern Jewish women. She confronts Jewish theology and its tendencies toward: male-centric language, and the singularity of its image of a superior God. She argues that such tendencies influence and motivate underlying patriarchal forces within traditional Judaism, and thus invalidate female experiences. By arguing for a multiplicity of images of God and the reassessment of God's role as non-hierarchical, Plaskow aims to provide a resolution within her Jewish feminist theology.

=== Rachel Adler ===
{{main|Rachel Adler}}
In her 1971 article entitled, [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:_aHy1mQXk-wJ:jwa.org/feminism/_html/_pdf/JWA001c.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgKmt25OwE0fl_Yilu_Ayd2XrtUpxtH52C6zkfrOLO9kO3MY2xVhkqGBpT6zzezOqIk1LBVxYL-V6FOndSiaBz7r2-hb4hLFEXlO_0b69WFpJG3VFbA2re0sEij_EvX3Ji0fDdu&amp;sig=AHIEtbRjKD8kuUm-7s5FWSmOBXwcs6djSA&amp;pli=1 "The Jew Who Wasn't There: Halacha and the Jewish Woman"], Adler provides an initial platform for her own analysis of feminist ethics within the Jewish tradition. Throughout various works, she focuses on Jewish traditional considerations of impurities within women. She presents a defense of Jewish ritual for female purification, in her 1972 work "Tum'ah and Toharah: Ends and Beginnings". However, in her 1993 essay, "In Your Blood, Live: Re-visions of a Theology of Purity", she rather arrives at an opposing conclusion, that traditional discussions of purity and impurity do not allow for an equalized system, between males and females and that such tradition suggests that "most impure people are women". In her 1983 essay entitled, "I've Had Nothing Yet, So I Can't Take More", she criticizes rabbinic tradition for marginalizing women within "its processes".

=== Blu Greenberg ===
{{main|Blu Greenberg}}
In her 1981 work, ''On Women and Judaism: A View from Tradition'', Blu Greenberg studies the many ways in which modern women are excluded from Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Blu|title=On Women and Judaism|year=1994|publisher=Jewish Publication Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, she develops a new space and way of practice for the female role, within traditional Judaism. She aims to uncover whether feminism is of benefit or detriment to Jewish tradition. Her works aims to mend the points of contention that she studies between Judaism and feminism. However, she is mutually committed to truly understanding whether feminism is beneficial for Jewish tradition.

=== Tamar Ross ===
{{main|Tamar Ross}}
Tamar Ross is a [[Modern Orthodox]] [[Jewish feminism|Jewish feminist]] thinker who confronts perceived flaws within traditional [[Jewish thought]] and law. She considers biases within what she considers patriarchal traditional text. In response to a traditional concept which she considers particularly problematic: the idea of "Torah from Heaven", she introduces the idea of evolving revelation. She develops this approach, and the metaphor of "Expanding the Palace of Torah", which she adopts from [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]'s philosophy, as she intends to promote expansion, rather than dismissal of religious tradition, and text. In her 2004 work, ''Expanding the Palace of Torah: Orthodoxy and Feminism'', she details a path by which Orthodoxy can become more inclusive of Feminist Ethics and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Tamar|title=Expanding the Palace of Torah|year=2004|publisher=Brandeis University Press|location=Waltham, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book, ''Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism: Resistance and Accommodation'', Tova Hartman offers experiential insight on the intersections of modern feminism and Jewish Tradition. Hartman provides three stances that she claims "may be relevant, resonant, and helpful in cultivating a strong feminist position vis-á-vis the traditional Jewish canon,": affirmation, rejection and reinterpretation. Her juxtaposition of feminist readings of Freud and alternative feminist readings of Orthodox Judaism allows Hartman to emphasize the utility and necessity of reinterpretation and revision in her own attempt at re-engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartman|first=Tova|title=Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism|year=2007|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Waltham, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Jewish ethics]] is the intersection of [[Judaism]] and the philosophical discipline of [[ethics]]. Most Jewish ethical texts derive from the [[Hebrew Bible]]. For centuries, the biblical literature has served as a "primary source for the development of Jewish moral concepts and ethical reflection".&lt;ref&gt;Mittleman 2012, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Tracing back to ancient rabbinic Judaism, scholars have sought to develop ethics and a moral code of conduct based on their understanding of the written Torah. [[Pirkei Avot]], a compilation of ethical teachings in the [[Talmud]], was written by the rabbis of the Mishnaic[[Mishna]]ic period. It outlines the Torah's views on ethics and interpersonal relationships and it is the only part of the Talmud not containing laws. Jewish ethics continued to expand in the Middle Ages as great Jewish thinkers including [[Moses Maimonides]], [[Saadya Gaon]], and [[Bahya ben Joseph ibn Paquda]] greatly contributed to moral Jewish thought. During the 19th and 20th centuries, Jewish ethics flourished, in part due to the development of the different denominations or branches of Judaism. There are many different scholars who have influenced contemporary Jewish ethics including [[Hermann Cohen]], [[Martin Buber]], and [[Emmanuel Levinas]]. Still, in recent decades, the interpretation and reinterpretation of Jewish ethics continues to be a source of debate among scholars.

In the 1970s, [[Feminism|Feminist]] Jewish scholars entered this debate. The [[Jewish feminism|Jewish feminist]] movement emerged as part of the Second Wave of Feminism in an attempt to&lt;ref&gt;"improve the social, religious, and legal status of women within Judaism and create new opportunities for religious experience and leadership."&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the feminist Jewish movement, many changes were made in the status and treatment of Jewish women, most notably regarding worship, [[liturgy]], and the practices of [[niddah]] and the [[mikveh]].

Along with changes to the treatment of women, there were new developments in feminist Jewish scholarship and thought. Prior to the 1970s and 1980s, women's voices were excluded from the predominantly male-oriented practices and texts of Judaism. Feminist Jewish-thought scholars have attempted to create a theological narrative that merges feminism with Judaism. According to [[Judith Plaskow]], one of the first Jewish feminist theologians, early Jewish feminists were mainly concerned with the exclusion of women from the [[minyan]], [[positive time-bound mitzvot]], and the inability for women to serve as witnesses and to initiate [[divorce]].&lt;ref&gt;wikipedia.org&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the dilemmas posed for Jewish feminist theologians extend beyond the original issues by tackling problems of women in [[liturgy]], biblical language, and [[sexuality]]. "Though all feminists believe that Judaism reflects a male bias, the extent to which each Jewish feminist believes Judaism and feminism are reconcilable"&lt;ref&gt;Plaskow 1991&lt;/ref&gt; has shaped the multitude of ways feminist scholars have approached feminist Jewish thought.

One approach for many [[Jewish feminism|feminist Jewish]] theologians has been the belief that Judaism is patriarchal[[Patriarchy|patriarchial]] at its core and that a few alterations to Jewish practices do not compensate for [[gender inequality]]. They believe Judaism is a system that reflects a dominantly male-voice and one in which woman is viewed as "other". It is their view that the current form of Judaism must be rejected. Feminist Jewish theologians have responded to this problem in a number ways. In the 1970s, Judith Plaskow, a [[Reform]] feminist theologian suggested the need for a complete re-imagining of Judaism. In many of her works, Plaskow addresses the problem of Judaism's androcentric theology and argues that feminism "demands a new understanding of Torah, God, and Israel".&lt;ref&gt;myjewishlearning.com&lt;/ref&gt; Not only must the male-dominated language of Judaism (such as the image of God as male and superior) be changed, but also a multiplicity of God images is an essential aspect of Jewish feminist theology. Furthermore, she promotes a Judaism in which the feminist mode of thought can help redefine the Jewish experience for women. From Plaskow's point of view, Judaism must undergo a complete reimagining that not only focuses on contemporary Jewish problems, but one that delves into the [[theology]] behind Judaism.

Another approach by feminist Jewish theologians has sought to integrate female concerns and female voices into an existing model of Judaism. [[Blu Greenberg]], an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Jew, is one such feminist who follows this model. In her most well known work, ''On Women and Judaism'' written in 1994, Greenberg presents a model for reconciling Judaism and feminism in a way that works within the boundaries of [[halakha]] and allows for "growth and greater equality in ritual and spiritual realms".&lt;ref&gt;Plaskow 1991, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; To accomplish this goal, Greenberg proposes many alterations to Jewish practices so that they more readily reflect women's equality. Scholars who support this model are more likely to use traditional resources as a means to foster a feminist Judaism because Judaism appears to be less androcentric. Theologians such as Greenberg ultimately advocate for a movement where Halakhah embodies and expresses women's concerns and infuses women's concerns with Jewish values.

[[Rachel Adler]], a [[Reform]] feminist Jewish theologian, has another approach for women's place in Jewish ethics. Adler, in her work ''Engendering Judaism'' written in 1998, advocates for the use of gender to help understand the Jewish past and shape the Jewish future. Adler acknowledges that although traditional Jewish law has systematically ignored women's voices, she also recognizes the centrality of Halacha. She thus envisions a Judaism, which would draw not only upon the totality of Jewish tradition and law, but also one in which gender and gender equality are central to the conversation, ultimately creating a more inclusive, engendered Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Adler 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

One other popular methodology used by feminist Jewish theologians is the belief that while there are gender inequalities within Judaism, they can be changed without altering the fundamentally traditional structures. [[Tamar Ross]], in ''Expanding the Palace of Torah'' written in 2004, outlines a path for a more inclusive [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]] of feminist values. She argues for a change within halakha, detailing halakhic legal tools that can allow for changes in Orthodoxy as well as providing theologies of revelation and God, which allow for the acceptance of these changes.&lt;ref&gt;Ross 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar fashion, [[Tova Hartman]], in her work ''Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism'' written in 2007, acknowledges the importance of biblical literatures, but argues for the rereading and reinterpretation of such texts to create a more inclusive Judaism for women.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes of status of women within Judaism===

The multitude of scholars who have addressed the tension between feminism and Judaism with respect to theology has led to significant changes within the different denominations of Judaism. For instance, women found the language of the traditional Judaic [[prayer book]] to be restrictive and lacking a feminine voice. The exclusion of [[matriarchy|matriarchs]] and sole use of male imagery to describe God suggested that public worship was primarily for men. In the early 1990s, prayer books began to include the names of the matriarchs as well as gender-sensitive God-language. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s many changes for women were made in synagogue life such as the inclusion of women in liturgical positions and the ability to form a minyan. In 1972, the Reform Movement in the United States ordained the first female rabbi. For many Jewish women, the Reform Movement provided an ideal setting for women's voices to be heard and their experiences to be central to Judaism rather than marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;Jewishvirtuallibrary.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist Movement]] soon followed in similar footsteps to those of Reform Judaism. [[Mordecai Kaplan]], founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, was a strong advocate for the equality of women in Judaism. He argued in his essays, The ''Reconstructionist Papers'', that Jewish law defines women as inferior to men and concludes that Jewish law must change and rid itself of these gender inequalities. In 1922, the first [[Bat Mitzvah]] occurred in a Reconstructionist synagogue, but it was not until 1974 that the Reconstructionist Movement ordained its first female rabbi. Reconstructionism has allowed women to voice their concerns from social issues like domestic violence to religious inequalities such as the right for women to read from the Torah. The Reconstructionist Movement has moved beyond Kaplan's original vision of equality toward a reconceptualization of Judaism through a feminist lens."&lt;ref&gt;Jwa.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservative Judaism]], in recent years, has seen its position on women shift towards equality as well. The [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] is the central authority on halakha within Conservative Judaism. By 1955, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards permitted women to chant blessings before and after the Torah readings and in 1973, women counted as members of a minyan. Ten years later, in October 1983, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]], the main education institution of the Conservative Movement, began accepting women in the rabbinical and cantorial schools. It ordained the first woman rabbi in the Conservative Movement in 1985. The Committee on Jewish Law Standards adopted three [[responsa]] in 2006 regarding the subject of middah. It reaffirmed the obligation of Conservative Jewish women to abstain from sexual relations during menstruation and the immersion in the mikveh, but has also loosened the restrictions regarding niddah.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbinicalassembly.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orthodox Movement has also seen progression for women. While it has yet to accept women into its rabbinate, in the past few decades, women have gained new rights and opportunities. Orthodox Jewish women now have the ability to work as rabbinical advocates, family purity experts, and synagogue leaders. In the late 1970s, women began to study Talmud and other Jewish texts. In the 1990s, women took on the role of ''to'anot rabaniyot'' or rabbinical advocates, a job previously only available to men. The to'anot help divorcing couples navigate the tricky legal system. In 1997, women were permitted to train as ''yoatzot halakha'', female Halakhic advisors who were knowledgeable in the laws and rituals regarding niddah and ritual purity. The details of these laws, which relate to menstruation as well as other issues of sexuality and women's health, render some women understandably uncomfortable in the presence of a male rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;Myjewishlearning.org&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1990s, many Modern Orthodox synagogues in the United States have created congregational leadership positions for women such as community scholar or assistant congregational leader. These positions resemble the duties of the rabbi, however, these women are careful not call themselves rabbi. Orthodox interpretations of Jewish law continue to prevent women from counting as part of minyan and from bearing witness.

==Approaches to traditional Jewish texts==
Feminist Jewish scholars approach Jewish texts with several ethical considerations. They struggle with the ethically problematic portrayal of women in [[Torah]] and rabbinic texts and offer their own readings of these texts. They often use Jewish Feminist values to reflect upon ethical practices in Judaism and in the modern world.

===Ethical readings of Torah===
Feminist Jewish scholars point out the mistreatment of women in the Torah. They argue that it is an ethical imperative to engage in the interpretation of Torah using a feminist lens. A Jewish Feminist critique of Torah is attentive to phenomena in the text such as the absence, silence, distortion, or subjugation of women in the text. Because the text exhibits a "normative character of maleness," a feminist critique is one in which "the stage of criticism is never left behind…"&lt;ref&gt;Plaskow, Judith. 1994. "Jewish Theology in Feminist Perspective." In Feminist Perspectives on Jewish Studies, ed. Lynn Davidman and Shelly Tenenbaum. New Haven:Yale University Press. p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

A common feminist critique of the [[Torah]] is noting the degree to which women are absent or silenced. [[Judith Plaskow]] writes, "Half of Jews have been women, but men have been defined as normative Jews, while women's voices and experiences are largely invisible in the record of Jewish belief and experience that has come down to us."&lt;ref&gt;Judith Plaskow. 1990 Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective. Harper. p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rachel Adler]] invokes the rabbinic concept of [[Geneivat da'at]] ("theft of the mind") to describe the process by which tradition "steals the memory of the true face of the other" by misremembering and misrepresenting women in the text.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adler. 1998. Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theorlogy and Ethics. Beacon Press: Boston, MA. pg 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminists also point out that the targeted audience of the Torah is male. Rachel Adler cites Exodus 19:15, "And he [Moses] said to the people, 'Be ready for the third day: do not go near a woman.'"&lt;ref&gt;NJPS Exodus 19:15&lt;/ref&gt; as an example of the male audience of the text. Moreover, Adler argues, when this text is read each year during the holiday of [[Shavuot]], women "are left standing apart as your mothers stood under the mountain, eavesdropping on the conversation between God and man, wondering if there is anything God wants you to do and, if so – why doesn't He tell you so Himself?"&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Rachel. 1983. "I've Had Nothing Yet So I Can't Take More," Moment 8:8 p.201-202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Plaskow, Judith. 1994. "Jewish Theology in Feminist Perspective." In Feminist Perspectives on Jewish Studies, ed. Lynn Davidman and Shelly Tenenbaum. New Haven:Yale University Press. p.78, Torah covers up history "Torah constructs a world that orders and makes sense of Jewish experience, but the world it constructs places men at the center. It is the written record of those with the power to keep records and to interpret and define the meaning of Jewish existence. In creating a particular vision of reality, it disguises alternative Jewish realities that may have coexisted alongside it."&lt;/ref&gt;

Having identified the [[patriarchy]] of the text and the way it has translated into unethical treatment of women, the project of many feminist writers is to reclaim the voices of women in the text. Plaskow writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt; [H]ints concerning women's experiences must be carefully ferreted out from narratives, prophecies, and legal texts focused on other matters. Biblical scholars, for example, have argued that the scant sources concerning Miriam suggest that she was probably an important cultic leader in early Israel. What exactly was the nature of her contribution and role?&lt;ref&gt;Plaskow, Judith. 1994. "Jewish Theology in Feminist Perspective." In Feminist Perspectives on Jewish Studies, ed. Lynn Davidman and Shelly Tenenbaum. New Haven:Yale University Press. p.70&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jewish feminist scholars frequently reflect that the Torah portrays woman subordinately. Tamar Ross writes, "[T]here is no denying that women's subordinate status did receive concrete expression even in biblical times."&lt;ref&gt;Tamar Ross. 2004. Expanding the Palace of Torah: Orthodoxy and Feminism. Brandeis University Press; Waltham, MA. p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Plaskow comments:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In Torah, Jewish Teaching, women are not absent, but they are cast in stories told by men. As characters in narrative, women may be vividly characterized, as objects of legislation, singled out for attention. But women's presence in Torah does not negate their silence, for women do not decide the questions with which Jewish sources deal.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Plaskow. 1990 Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective. Harper p.3&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

These critiques are challenging from a Jewish perspective because of the centrality of the Torah in the Jewish tradition. Many feminists describe the tension of criticizing that which they hold precious. [[Tova Hartman]], who identifies as [[Modern Orthodox]], describes this tension:

&lt;blockquote&gt; To know that one is feminist and to know that one loves the Bible is, in the thinking of many, at best an oxymoron, perhaps clever as a rhetorical statement but surely not a possibility for existential living. After all, no woman can serve two authorities, a master called Scripture and a mistress called Feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Tova Hartman. 2007. Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism: Resistance and Accommodation. Brandeis: MA. p.4&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jewish feminists differ in their treatment of [[source criticism]] as a tool for feminist [[biblical criticism]]. Some Jewish feminists maintain that source critical methods help the reader to identify the historical context and explain the androcentric nature of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Plaskow. 1990 Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective. Harper p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox feminist writers take issue with this lens because it rejects the traditional understanding of the origins of the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;Tamar Ross. 2004. Expanding the Palace of Torah: Orthodoxy and Feminism. Brandeis University Press; Waltham, MA. p.189&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical issues of Rabbinic texts ===

Rabbinic texts serve as foundational materials for much of Jewish life and practice including both legal and narrative areas of Jewish life. Feminists identify similar issues of patriarchy within rabbinic literature as they do in their critiques of Torah. Just as with Torah, they assert that rabbinic texts silence, subjugate, misremember, and oppress women.

Laurie Zoloth writes that when women read rabbinic text, "We witness the discussion of our existence as the considered object, largely unnamed, and called only by the name of their relationship to men ('Rabbi Hiyya's wife,' 'the widow,' 'his handmaiden') and often seen only in terms of the most external of features."&lt;ref&gt;Laurie. 1999. "Reading Like a Girl: Gender and Text in Jewish Bioethics," Judaism 190:48 no.2. p.167&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel Adler utilizes [[object-relations theory]], that understands this phenomenon and "explain that it is because women are not perceived as autonomous subjects in these narratives."&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adler. 1998. Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics. Beacon Press: Boston, MA. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Zoloth describes that the result of this process is that:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The woman as reader must project herself right out of her body, the body of the discourse, imagine herself into the male-self of her teacher, who is imagining rabbis imagining the fictive body of women. It is elaborate textual cross-dressing.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie. 1999. "Reading Like a Girl: Gender and Text in Jewish Bioethics," Judaism 190:48 no.2. p.168&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many Jewish feminist scholars also criticize the imagery rabbinic texts use to describe women and the consequences of those images. Plaskow notes that rabbinic texts frequently portray women as temptresses&lt;ref&gt;Judith Plaskow. 1990 Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective. Harper p.179&lt;/ref&gt; and connects this imagery to halakhic legislation aimed at controlling women's sexuality. Susan Shapiro identifies the use of the "married harlot" image in Maimonides and points to his writings permitting the beating of one's wife. She writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt; I am not suggesting that Maimonides required the metaphor of the 'married harlot' to hold this position on wife beating. … The metaphor didn't make him do it. Rather, … [the metaphor] further reinforces, rationalizes, and justifies such violence against wives and women. Metaphors matter. They have consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Susan. 1997. "A matter of Discipline: Reader for Gender in Jewish Philosophy. In: M. Peskowitz and L. Levitt (eds), Judaism Since Gender. New York: Routledge p.165&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rabbinic literary genre of [[midrash]] is often suggested by feminist thinkers are being particularly well suited to feminist endeavors. Suzanne Stone writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The great attraction of midrash for feminist legal scholars, however, is that it may be read as a metaphoric discussion of legal and moral concepts, one that transcends the traditional dichotomies of law and literature or reason and emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Suzanne Last. 2004. "Feminism and the Rabbinic Conception of Justice." In Hava Tirosh-Samuelson, ed. Women and Gender in Jewish Philosophy. Indiana University Press p.268&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, Plaskow writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Yet historiography is not the only nor the best source for the feminist expansion of Torah. Jews have traditionally used midrash to broaden or alter the meanings of texts. The midrashic process of bringing contemporary questions to traditional sources and elaborating on the sources in response to questions easily lends itself to feminist use.&lt;ref&gt;Plaskow, Judith. 1994. "Jewish Theology in Feminist Perspective." In Feminist Perspectives on Jewish Studies, ed. Lynn Davidman and Shelly Tenenbaum. New Haven:Yale University Press. p.80&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some scholars reject the midrashic approach. [[Heidi Ravven]] argues that the claim that texts have "multiple levels of meaning" is a "pre-modern fiction" that, "With the advent of scientific historical scholarship of texts we can no longer claim [to be true]." Ravven suggests that instead of rereading old texts with new ethical understandings, feminists need to confront the Jewish philosophical tradition "head on" and create change through this "philosophic response".&lt;ref&gt;Ravven, Heidi M. 1986 "Creating a Jewish Feminist Philosophy," Anima 12:2 p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical readings of Torah and Rabbinic text ===
Many tools characterize a feminist reading of Torah and rabbinic text. Some feminist readings focus on giving voice to otherwise silent women in texts. Plaskow reflects on the characters of Miriam and Dinah, and references to the worship of goddesses as areas of silence and misremembering which are deserving of a voice.&lt;ref&gt;Plaskow, Judith. 1994. "Jewish Theology in Feminist Perspective." In Feminist Perspectives on Jewish Studies, ed. Lynn Davidman and Shelly Tenenbaum. New Haven:Yale University Press. p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoloth describes a gendered reading as one that recognizes that the text naturally "pulls" in the direction of a male reader. She suggests a type of reading which she calls "reading like a girl." Zoloth explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Reading like a girl then deconstructs the narrative logic of the passage because the reader resists the forward going movement of the narrative with a motion of her own, turning away from the conversation to another possible conversation, not yet quite spoken, but whose possibilities suggest ... an alternative plane of moral discourse. It will be the counter-text, the background and not the foreground, an alternative patterning, that will arise with a gendered reading.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie. 1999. "Reading Like a Girl: Gender and Text in Jewish Bioethics," Judaism 190:48 no.2. p.170&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

While these feminist thinkers, and others like them, suggest readings that in some manner reinterpret or redeem the text, others suggest reading the texts as they are to point out the ethical quandaries present within them. Plaskow refers to this as "preaching against the text" and remarks that, "Remaining silent about the negative aspects of tradition not only leaves them to do their work in the world, it also deprives us of an important spiritual resources." [Judith Plaskow, "Preaching against the text" in The Coming of Lilith: Essays on Feminism, Judaism, and Sexual Ethics. Boston: Beacon Press, 2005. P.155] Plaskow identifies these spiritual resources as responses to the pain that exists in Jewish communities and that can be alleviated if people use these texts as opportunities to discuss the issues that could be the source of this pain.

=== Health care ===
Laurie Zoloth poses the question, "How are religious scholars shaping the moral sense of ethical choices in American life?"&lt;ref&gt;Zoloth, Laurie. 1999. Health Care and the Ethics of Encounter. University of North Carolina Press p.10&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that the voice of Jewish tradition can bring back a voice of community in the face of a culture that values autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Zoloth, Laurie. 1999. Health Care and the Ethics of Encounter. University of North Carolina Press p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Zoloth uses biblical and rabbinic texts to foster an ethic of health care in the United States. She discusses a story in the [[Talmud]] to reflect on the issue of micro-allocation of medical resources.&lt;ref&gt;Zoloth, Laurie. 1999. Health Care and the Ethics of Encounter. University of North Carolina Press p.161&lt;/ref&gt; The story relates:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Two people were walking along the way, and in the hand of one of them was a flask of water. If both of them drink, they die, but if one of them drinks, he reaches civilization. Ben Petura expounded: it is better that both of them should drink and die and let not one of them see the death of his fellow. Until Rabbi Akiba came and taught: "That your brother may live with you" – your life takes precedence over the life of your fellow. (Bava Metzia 62a)&lt;ref&gt;Zoloth, Laurie. 1999. Health Care and the Ethics of Encounter. University of North Carolina Press p.161&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zoloth analyzes this, and many other sources, to arrive at ethical language through which society can frame the debate on medical ethics. She write, "The impoverishment of the community is a real factor, and it must be considered even when a life is at stake. The project of a community as a whole must be affected by the plight of the one, according to Rashi, but there are limits on obligation."&lt;ref&gt;Zoloth, Laurie. 1999. Health Care and the Ethics of Encounter. University of North Carolina Press p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

In framing a new discourse on health care, Zoloth offers a feminist ethical reading of the [[Book of Ruth]]. She points to passages and themes in Ruth that detail friendship, family, and community depicted as an obligation and a right. She also highlights the themes of loving the community, the value of face-to-face encounters, and the responsibility of the social order to provide for a "basic minimum".&lt;ref&gt;Zoloth, Laurie. 1999. Health Care and the Ethics of Encounter. University of North Carolina Press chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; She concludes, "What Ruth teaches is that citizenship is solidarity, that meaningful discourse starts with the recognition of the other, and that justice is prior to any human freedom".&lt;ref&gt;Zoloth, Laurie. 1999. Health Care and the Ethics of Encounter. University of North Carolina Press p.218&lt;/ref&gt; This feminist ethical analysis derives its values from the action of a female biblical heroine.

=== Abortion ===
David Kraemer notes that when Jewish commentators speak about values or ethics, "virtually without exception, even when they have claimed to be speaking of values or ethics, their discourse shows that they have really meant Jewish law (Halacha)".&lt;ref&gt;David Kraemer, "Jewish Ethics and Abortion," in Exploring Judaism: The Collected Essays of David Kraemer. Scholars Press, 1999. P.55&lt;/ref&gt; Kraemer constructs an ethical discourse on the topic of abortion that engages traditional rabbinic texts but that does not reflect a standard halachic approach to abortion. Kraemer claims that the "halachic approach to abortion leads to a dead end." but that this approach can evaluate questions such as "how Jewish traditions view the life or potential life of a fetus, the relationship of the fetus to the mother (and father), and the prerogatives of a mother (and father) with respect to the fetus."&lt;ref&gt;David Kraemer, "Jewish Ethics and Abortion," in Exploring Judaism: The Collected Essays of David Kraemer. Scholars Press, 1999. P.57&lt;/ref&gt; Kraemer notes that, "From the ethicist's perspective, the Talmud's inconclusiveness in this matter is its most notable feature."&lt;ref&gt;David Kraemer, "Jewish Ethics and Abortion," in Exploring Judaism: The Collected Essays of David Kraemer. Scholars Press, 1999. p.57&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he concludes that this lack of clarity "Is the most important characteristic of these various rabbinic discussion. This indecision offers us proper advice; we should hear it as a caution."&lt;ref&gt;David Kraemer, "Jewish Ethics and Abortion," in Exploring Judaism: The Collected Essays of David Kraemer. Scholars Press, 1999. P.77&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Globalization ===
Donna Berman posits a form of feminist ethics, what she calls nashiut ethics, in which the goal is "not to redeem oppressive texts, but to redeem Jewish women – and men – from oppressive texts."&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Donna. Nashiut Ethics. PhD diss., Drew University, 2001 p.202&lt;/ref&gt; Berman identifies the Jewish value of [[tikkun olam]] as an "essential ingredient"&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Donna. Nashiut Ethics. PhD diss., Drew University, 2001 p.204&lt;/ref&gt; of faith because it serves to counteract the abuse of mistreatment of women. Berman suggests the topic of [[globalization]] as an area on which nashiut ethics can comment because "it represents well the complex web of race, gender and class issues which are … the defining ingredients of early twenty-first century moral dilemmas."&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Donna. Nashiut Ethics. PhD diss., Drew University, 2001 p.215&lt;/ref&gt; Berman then suggests that nashiut ethics would rebel against the forces of greed and exploitation and support the minority and oppressed workers in their struggle for recognition.

=== Jewish wedding ceremony ===
[[Rachel Adler]] points out that the Jewish rituals surrounding marriage stem from biblical and talmudic conceptions of women as property and therefore reflect talmudic rites of property transfer. Adler writes, "The legal definition, derived from talmudic property law, anachronistically categorizes women as a special kind of chattel over which the husband has acquired rights."&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adler. 1998. Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics. Beacon Press: Boston, MA p.169&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the patriarchal and unethical roots of this ceremony, Adler proposes a solution that will "treat both parties consistently as persons rather than as property." [Rachel Adler. 1998. Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics. Beacon Press: Boston, MA p.&amp;nbsp;169] Adler outlines a new wedding ceremony based on the [[sheva brachot]] (the celebratory blessings bestowed upon a newly married couple) that is compatible with an egalitarian society. Adler refers to this new ceremony as B'rit Ahuvim (a covenant of lovers).&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adler. 1998. Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics. Beacon Press: Boston, MA Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Denominational approaches ==
===Conservative===

One of the major source of feminist Jewish ethics literature for [[Conservative Judaism]] comes from [[Judith Plaskow]]. Growing up in a classical [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] family during the 1950s, Plaskow became interested in theology as a teenager, and was the first [[Jewish feminism|Jewish feminist]] to identify herself as a theologian.&lt;ref&gt;Raucher Lecture. Jewish Theological Seminary "Feminist Jewish Ethics." 10/9/2013&lt;/ref&gt; She began to write about feminist ethics and the role of women in Judaism in the 1970s, her most famous work being The Coming of Lilith.

Plaskow was part of the Ezrat Nashim, a small Jewish feminist group who presented the "Call for Change" to the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] of the Conservative movement on March 14, 1972. While the Reform movement was already starting to address the role of women in Judaism, these Conservative women wanted to start a conversation with the heads of the Conservative movement. This call for change represents a liberal feminist stance, arguing for equal access to positions of leadership and religious participation from which Jewish women were excluded because of their gender.&lt;ref&gt;Ezrat Nashim's "Call for Change"&lt;/ref&gt; The heads of the Conservative movement at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] finally responded to Feminist outcry, and on October 24, 1983 began admitting women into the Rabbinical School.

In her essay ''The Right Question is Theological'', Plaskow attempts to create a new imagining of Judaism for Conservative women. She argues that "the Jewish women's movement of the past decade has been and remains a civil-rights movement rather than a movement for "women's liberation"".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Feminism in Judaism, especially Conservative Judaism, is too concerned with the status of women in religious life, as well as the [[Halakhah|halakhic]] language involved with change. She argues that a better focus for women in the Conservative movement would be the origins of the images and treatment of women in the text, and how reinterpretation of these ideas is required for the Conservative movement to evolve as a modern sect of Judaism.
Feminists in the Conservative movement attempted to apply a feminist lens to [[Torah]], [[Israel]], and God. Through Torah, Jews can uncover women's histories and cultures throughout the biblical period.&lt;ref&gt;Raucher Lecture. Jewish Theological Seminary "Feminist Jewish Ethics." 10/9/2013&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of Israel allows members of the Conservative community to look at Jewish women present, equal, and responsible members of the Jewish community. With respect to God, Conservative Jews can analyze halakhah while rejecting the overall patriarchal voice that dominates the religion. Yet there are more fundamental flaws in the theology that must be addressed as well. In particular, the image of God as superior. Arguing for a multiplicity of God images is an essential aspect of Jewish Feminist Theology, and that the role of God as non-hierarchical must be stressed in Conservative feminist Judaism.

Conservative feminists also believe that changes in Jewish communal structure with regard to worship contribute to a new understanding of God without the use of a male-dominated metaphor or language. [[Synagogues]] and communities that have advocated for women's leadership and allow women to play a larger role in the service gain access to a higher, spiritual diversity, in [[Chavurah]] prayer and study. Plaskow supports this, and defends this analysis as theology, claiming that "an established system can become self-perpetuating and lose its ability for introspection and re-examination of basic premises"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Reform===

Fundamental sources of Feminist texts in Reform Judaism come from [[Rachel Adler]]. Originally married to an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbi, she eventually divorced in 1984 and remarried a committed Reform Jew. Her discontentment with the current status of women in Orthodox Judaism can be seen in her article ''I've Had Nothing Yet, So I Can't Take More''. She believes that some of the fundamental issues in Judaism can never be resolved, and Reform Judaism needs to reevaluate the entire halakhic system in order to assess ideas about women that Reform Judaism currently does not discuss.

Feminist Reform Jews attempt to define what it means to engender Judaism. "There is not and never was a Judaism unaffected by the gendered perspectives of its transmitters and augmenters".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 | last = Adler
 | first = Rachel
 | title = Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics

Feminist Reform Jews attempt to explore a reading of the text that inflicts gender equality. the movement has been consciously remaking itself, and this is an attempt to modernize the scripture for contemporary Reform Jews, as Halakhah is too central to the Jewish experience to completely eliminate.

Adler, and many other Reform women, live with conflicted [[Jewish identity|Jewish identities]]. Women refuse to disavow the sacred stories and texts that are the foundations to Judaism, yet are constantly fighting to make their voice heard in a for-men, by-men religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

These women, and Reform feminist leaders attempt to reconcile a contemporary sense of female equality within Judaism.

Halakhah is not a sufficient narrative, yet it serves as a bridge between reality and the ideal. The goal here is to look at Halakhah as stories. There exists a master narrative that needs to be reinterpreted in Modern Reform Judaism to fit the modern, western American Jews live in today. By juxtaposing different stories, we are able to use this dichotomy between halakhah and [[aggadah]] to develop a modern theology that is inclusive of women's experiences in Reform Judaism.

===Orthodox===

Tamar Ross, one of the leading Orthodox Feminists, hopes to outline a path for Orthodoxy that calls for the inclusion of Feminist values and an [[egalitarian]] setting in the Orthodox movement. A student of [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rav Kook]], she argues for change from within Orthodoxy, as opposed to bringing outside information in (different from [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodoxy]]). "It is the Torah that must absorb the world rather than the world the Torah".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 | last = Ross
 | first = Tamar
 | title = Expanding the Palace of Torah: Orthodoxy and Feminism
 | year = 2004
 | pages = 171}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
She argues for a gradual process through which Orthodoxy can expand to include feminist thought.

Orthodox feminists believe that the Jewish tradition has room to accommodate space for both men and women in the patriarchal master narrative. Following Ross's guidance, Orthodox Jews attempt to "expanding the palace of Torah" to accommodate both genders, while also staying true to Orthodoxy and halakhah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Many Orthodox Feminist clash with other Jewish Feminists over Dialectical Theology, an understanding of the Torah which "understands everything said about God as a human effort to convey or recapture certain religious moments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 | last = Ross

This is problematic, as it suggests sections of the Torah was not written by God, a fundamental belief of Orthodoxy. Instead, many Orthodox feminists attempt to apply Process Theology to the text. This theology recognizes that God and the world are continually evolving, and everything in the world becomes a partner with God. This technology better fits Orthodoxy, as it does not attempt to challenge the fundamentals of Halakhah in Judaism.

In Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism, [[Tova Hartman]], a Modern Orthodox Feminist, explores some of the major points of interest to feminists as it applies to contemporary women in Modern Orthodoxy. She, along with many other Modern Orthodox women, struggle with their own definition of Judaism, and hopes to explore the numerous ways to change feminine participation and experience in Judaism without leaving the comfort of Modern Orthodoxy, the faction of Judaism these women are most familiar with, and hold their alliance to. Hartman's major topics of exploration include countering the patrilineal focus of biblical Judaism, the conflicting nature of male-regulated [[niddah]] rulings, and the benefits of experience women would provide to Judaism as a whole with a more united voice and active role. These topics are explored through three different responses: affirmation, rejection, and reinterpretation. Ultimately, Hartman supports the reinterpretation model, but all responses are available to Feminists critiquing the role of women in Modern Orthodoxy. Traditional representations of women are no longer acceptable, and Hartman attempts to lead women in the Modern Orthodox movement into a new era of Jewish Orthodoxy.
[[Blu Greenberg]], a second leading Modern Orthodox feminist, attempts to address the needs for reform within the leaders of Modern Orthodoxy. She claims that what Modern Orthodoxy needs today is "the creation of a dialectical tension between Jewish values and the mores of modern society in light of the far reaching implications of women's liberation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Tapping into how feminism relates directly to Judaism, how Halakha can apply directly to both genders, niddah, and the role of Jewish women in the family.

One of Greenberg's leading points is that a larger role for women in Modern Orthodoxy shouldn't be equated to "adding a fifth fringe on the tzitzit or a fifth variety to the lulav".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 | last = Greenberg
 | first = Blu
 | title = On Women and Judaism: A View from Tradition
 | year = 1994
 | pages = 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Women struggle to find their place in Modern Orthodoxy outside the stereotypical "mothering" role that has been the standard for years. Following Greenberg, Modern Orthodox feminists attempt to apply Halakha universally to male and female roles, without fundamentally altering history, the text, or all moral obligations.

==Feminist ethical approaches to Jewish theology==
To glean knowledge from this section, it is important to note that the definition of [[theology]] is understood as "the systematic and rational study of concepts of deity and of the nature of religious truths".
[[Feminist ethics]] with the addition of a Jewish lens hosts a variety of theological opinions with differing views of what Feminist Jewish Ethics entails. While some discuss the language and figures of speech like [[metaphors]], others weigh more heavily regarding the foundations of the religion and its male authoritative figures or simply the stories that tell the master-narrative, the juris-generative, communal ideas that re-calibrate the social norm.

[[Judith Plaskow]] wrote about use of masculine pronouns and the [[patriarchy]] dominated nature of Judaism. In her book, ''Standing Again at Sinai'', she claims that there is "a sense of fluidity, movement, and multiplicity, [a] daring interweaving of women's experiences with Jewish, Native American, and Goddess imagery that leaves the reader/hearer with an expanded sense of what is possible in speaking of/to God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plaskow|first=Judith|title=Standing Again at Sinai|year=1990|publisher=Harper|location=San Francisco|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Plaskow, the homogeneous use of language is one of the main proponents of the patriarchal nature of Judaism. Plaskow's theology, while fully acknowledging that the metaphors and images of God are man-made, notes that the language forms out of a societal standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillman |first=Neil |title=The Feminist Critique of God Language |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Theology/God/Modern_Views/Feminist_Critique.shtml?p=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221183311/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Theology/God/Modern_Views/Feminist_Critique.shtml?p=2 |archivedate=2013-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when change occurs socially, so too must the method of approaching law. From Plaskow's perspective, "To expand Torah, we must reconstruct Jewish history to include the history of women, and in doing so alter the shape of Jewish memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plaskow|first=Judith|title=Standing Again at Sinai|year=1990|publisher=Harper|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaskow's notions of relabeling and re-figuring the language used to describe higher power suggest that the current system of Judaism cannot continue in any form egalitarianism because without common language, there will forever be a separation between male and female. Contrasting thinkers, like [[Tamar Ross]], still see the need for an inclusion, but find that need to be inherently non-Jewish and in opposition to the fundamental theology on which the religion is based.

Within approaches to theology, however, the sole focus does not come from how God is or isn't addressed or the language surrounding a Feminist Jewish ethic. Many thinkers have stepped away from focusing on the language and instead, looked at the content.
[[Rachel Adler]] suggests that halakha itself is too central to Judaism, that a perpetual cycle where men create the language and the law that all are expected to follow is detrimental to the future of Judaism, but that it is still necessary to the essence of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adler|first=Rachel|title=Engendering Judaism}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blu Greenberg]] brought the phrase "where there is a rabbinic will, there is a halakhic way" to Jewish feminism in 1981, printed within the pages of her book ''On Women and Judaism.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Blu|title=On Women and Judaism|publisher=Jewish Publication Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg's understanding of Jewish theology is contingent on the texts that have shaped its existence in the 21st century.

Rabbi Donna Berman, Ph. D. formed her theology through the method of Nashiut Ethics, an ethical system of "doing Jewish ethics"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Center |first=Charter Oak |title=Rabbi Donna Berman, Ph.D |url=http://www.charteroakcenter.org/index.php/about-us/rabbi-donna-berman-phd/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131218185844/http://www.charteroakcenter.org/index.php/about-us/rabbi-donna-berman-phd/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that revolves around lived experience, rather than the law or texts that are included within the greater Jewish canon. For Berman, those that have been marginalized will never be heard unless they are asked, unless their experiences are brought to the table to show what is true for the Jewish people within a societal context. Her ethical system is based on those found in [[Ada Maria Isasi-Diaz]]'s mujerista theology and [[womanism]], committed to equality and social justice, and strays farthest from presenting Jewish source texts or basing her thought in any form of Halakha, Jewish law. Berman's theology pieces together some of Adler and Plaskow's thoughts, while still pulling from completely different schools of thought within feminist Judaism. By uncovering the stories of the disenfranchised, Nashiut Ethics offers an opportunity to change the language that Judaism uses. According to Berman, the voices that were never heard before, those who never had the chance to speak up, either because they weren't asked anything or they weren't asked the right questions. Upon opening the doors for a new conversation, the barriers set forth by a patriarchal system are broken down. Through this methodology, Judaism can prosper and progress relative to society and the conditions of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=Donna|title=Nashiut Ethics: Articulating An Ethics of Safe-Keeping|publisher=Drew University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics in Jewish practice==
While ethicists are able to come up with Feminist approaches to Judaism, this often becomes complicated when examining specific rituals and practices of Judaism. When examining the practice and actions of Judaism, as opposed to the thoughts and beliefs, many issues arise. Before delving into each individually, it is important to remember that even within this alternative area of study, the issues take a slant towards catering to the normative, western individual's narrative. Deirdre Butler warns against this in her 'Disturbing Boundaries: Developing Jewish Feminist Ethics with Buber, Levinas, and Fackenheim' (2012).

"Similarly, the specific issues raised by normative narratives about able-bodiedness, heterosexuality, and gender identity in the Jewish tradition, let to experiences of marginalization and injustice that are too often not discerned by many Jewish feminist. Finally North American Jewish feminists need to be wary of the ways in which North Americans still dominate Jewish feminists discourse in the academy and at the level of activism&lt;ref&gt;Deidre Butler. 2012. "Disturbing Boundaries: Developing Jewish Feminist Ethics with Buber, levinas and Fackenheim" Journal of Modern Jewish Studies. p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;"

=== Jewish liturgy ===
{{main|Jewish prayer}}
Almost all Jewish feminist ethicists struggle with finding women's place in the liturgy while still maintaining a level of tradition. However, within this there are a few different approaches; some believe that women need to find their place in what exists, other ethicists think that something new needs to be created. Others think that what exists needs to be reclaimed and reappropriated.

In 1990&lt;ref&gt;Judith Plaskow. 1990 Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective. Harper. p. 57, 60&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Plaskow]] introduced the consciousness of women being present at Sinai. While women were left out of the narrative of being present when the Jewish people received the Torah that does not mean that women do not have that claim over it; she argues it is up to women to engage in the reshaping of the reading of Torah as well as reshaping the Jewish community as a whole. She points out that Jewish feminists have continuously implemented rituals and written liturgy that come from women's experiences such as [[Rosh Chodesh]] or Feminist [[Haggadot]] for [[Pesach]]. To Plaskow, this is the most ethical way for women to own Jewish liturgy without denouncing traditional practice; as she believes that the current liturgy isn't something to dismiss.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Plaskow. 2005. The Coming of Lilith: Essays on Feminism, Judaism, and Sexual Ethics. Boston: Beacon Press. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachel Adler]] takes a similar stance writing that inclusion and tradition are not enemies. That being said, she does think that it is harmful to push women to the peripheral and dangerous for them to accept marginalized prayer and practice. Therefore, for Adler this is not enough, as it does not actually impact Jewish liturgy as a whole. To her the ideal is taking the traditional liturgy that is in place and making it gender inclusive, filling it with feminist imagery and language.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adler. 1998. Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics. Beacon Press: Boston, MA. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tova Hartman]] offers something different aligning herself with [[Maimonides]] and takes his permission to change the liturgy in order to "facilitate a greater sense of connection between the subjective self-image of the supplicants and words they use to pray".&lt;ref&gt;Tova Hartman. 2007. Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism: Resistance and Accommodation. Brandeis: MA. p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Still, this idea is complicated by the fact that it is challenging to create a universal meaningful prayer that connects to people's subjective experiences. Both [[Rachel Adler]]&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adler, "The Jew Who Wasn't There: Halakha and the Jewish Woman," in Susannah Heschel, ed. On Being a Jewish Feminist. Schocken Books: New York, 1983 (12-18)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Blu Greenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Blu Greenberg. 1994. On Women and Judaism: A View from Tradition. Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the first step to women finding their place in Jewish obligations and prayer is educating them on the intricacies of [[Halakha]]. Only from there can women be adequately integrated and take on leadership roles, truly redefining women's place in Judaism.

=== Jewish marriage and Agunah ===
{{main|Jewish marriage|Agunah}}
All Jewish feminist ethicists see that there is a problem in the way the laws of a Jewish marriage are laid out; specifically they question the laws of Agunah. While it is almost universally challenged there is some variation in the nuances of where ethicists take issue with Agunah. Plaskow recognizes that when established the Rabbis were acting and making laws within a framework that had fundamental and systemic inequalities. While this is a law that is specifically oppressive and harmful, she sees it in the larger context of Jewish law which as whole both others and limits women.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Plaskow. 1990 Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective. Harper. p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; As an Orthodox Jew Blu Greenberg struggles with Agunah and the fact that she sees a place where Halakha as harmful. Greenberg acknowledges the potential for abuse in Jewish divorce law. Furthermore, in Greenberg's work of talking to and interviewing women she sees that despite there being some rabbis who resolve individual cases of divorce with compassion, the process as a whole is very humiliating for women [9].

Rachel Adler&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adler. 1998. Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics. Beacon Press: Boston, MA. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; writes more extensively on the subject both critiquing Jewish marriage and offering an alternative model. Adler find the traditional Halakha to be very much lacking a mutuality, pushing back on the scriptures description of marriage as an ownership that is upheld by the rabbis in law. In creating a new model Adler looked for a way to bring mutuality in, balancing the needs of the individuals. Ultimately she settles on a template based on that of a business partnership as this lends itself to the communal standards that address economic and welfare issues. She calls this a theory of Brit Ahuvim, a contract of love. She recognizes the history of oppression and separation that women have faced and this her attempt to work towards equality in marriage and divorce law while still refusing to reject Halakha; rather this is a reconstruction and reconfiguration of tradition&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adler. 1998. Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics. Beacon Press: Boston, MA. pg 169&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mikveh===
{{main|Mikveh}}
One of the few existing rituals that is in place solely for women is the Mikveh. The idea of women purifying themselves in a ritual bath has caused much discussion and an overall lack of unity on if this practice is ethical and/or feminists. Hartman speaks to the ways that the Mikveh actually gives women power and enables them to use their bodies as sexual weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Tova Hartman. 2007. Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism: Resistance and Accommodation. Brandeis: MA. p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially she is saying that because women decide when they go to the Mikveh and go through the purifying ritual they then have the power to withhold their bodies and withhold sex from their spouses. Greenberg 12&lt;ref&gt;Blu Greenberg. 1994. On Women and Judaism: A View from Tradition. Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt; takes an alternative approach and through interviews finds that most women actually value and see the Mikveh as a positive ritual in Judaism and in their lives. While she briefly problematizes Mikvehs, mostly she focuses on how the ritual has been modernized and how women have come to feel grateful for the obligation. Adler 13&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adler. 1998. Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics. Beacon Press: Boston, MA&lt;/ref&gt; touches on the ethical implications of this ritual and what it means for women. Because she sees women as peripherally involved in Judaism she sees the practice of going to the Mikveh as perpetuating this. To Adler, while going to the Mikveh is a traditional ritual exclusively done by women, its purpose is to enable men to complete [[mitzvot]]. Adler sees it as such: women go to the mikveh and engage in this ritual of purification so that her husband can have intercourse with her and so that she will bear children - an exclusively male mitzvah. Thus, Adler sees this ritual as supremely unethical. Outside of these texts there are currently many efforts working towards helping women reclaim this ritual and enabling them to have it be something empowering in their lives. Still, it cannot be ignored that there is a ritual in Jewish tradition that requires women to purify themselves in a way that has no parallel to male purification.

===Niddah===
{{main|Niddah}}

Niddah is one of the most extensive rituals that women are required to perform in Judaism. The laws are very intricate and only the most educated rabbis, male of course, have the authority and education to relay the rules to women. Because of this, and the nature of how women are forced to defer to male authority, in what is often a very humiliating way, many Jewish thinkers; including ethicists and feminists, see the laws and practices of Niddah as both unethical and anti-feminists.

In Tova Hartman's&lt;ref&gt;Tova Hartman. 2007. Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism: Resistance and Accommodation. Brandeis: MA&lt;/ref&gt; interviews of women who practice niddah she experienced a wide variety of reactions to and feelings on this ritual. While not all felt this way there were many who expressed feeling that this ritual was oppressive, dehumanizing, suffocating, demoralizing, and even a divestment of their personal power. The laws of niddah were established by men and opposed onto women. While niddah contributes to the hostility towards female sexuality, it is representative of the larger perspective towards the nature of sexuality in Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Tova Hartman. 2007. Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism: Resistance and Accommodation. Brandeis: MA&lt;/ref&gt; Many women experience the laws rigidity and their obligation to adhere to them as causing both emotional and physical strain. This is further perpetuated by the authoritarian male structure that is in place. When describing the feelings they have when going through the process of having to go to a male rabbi and have him inspect the bloodstain, many touched on the aspect of a loss of their agency and power. While not specific to niddah, niddah is an extreme example of women being forced into passivity due to a lack of education; even thought they are the ones forced to abide by the laws. The lack of power and impact that this ritual has on women, as well as its sheer rigor, has called into question how ethical it is from a Jewish and feminist perspective.

Despite a great amount of push-back there are some women who see niddah as a positive part of their lives. Plaskow points out that it was women who strengthened the laws of niddah (although their motives are unknown).&lt;ref&gt;Judith Plaskow. 1990 Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective. Harper&lt;/ref&gt; In Hartman's interviews she found that some appreciated the regulation it provided and how it respected women's biological-emotional needs. Similarly, there were some who spoke about how the ritual allowed for them to focus on a transitional period, others on how it sanctioned sexual desires within the framework of marriage. While problematic in its own right, some women were grateful for the protection it gave them against sexual advances they did not want to partake in. Greenberg sees niddah as Judaism's way of safeguarding women against becoming mere sex objects.

Tamara Ross sees the holiness in this practice as a means of seeing the ethicality of it. Ross sees the fixed period of separation from her husband that women go into as parallel to the periods of separation that God enters when affording the world the opportunity to amass new creative powers. There is also much written on this separation in regards to [[Jewish mysticism]]; seeing God as female and the force of purification and protection. By identifying niddah with holiness the necessity of this observance is confirmed. Similarly, doing this affirms women's own sense of self-worth by portraying God in their likeness. Some women express that niddah adds holiness to their primal, sexual urges.&lt;ref&gt;Blu Greenberg. 1994. On Women and Judaism: A View from Tradition. Jewish Publication Society. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is made that by reclaiming this observance and reappropriating it with the needs of women, this practice can be considered both ethical and feminists.

=== Sexuality ===
Sexuality, specifically female sexuality, is something that Judaism values. The idea of [[Onah]], or male obligation to sexually satisfy his wife speaks to this. However, as Adler says, "The theological ethics of sexuality is to bridge the chasm between what is and what out to be".&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adler. 1998. Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics. Beacon Press: Boston, MA
&lt;/ref&gt; Female sexuality is seen and talked about in Judaism, as something possessed by men.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Plaskow. 1990 Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective. Harper. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; The question of ethics comes in when examining the language used to talk about sexuality. Similarly to niddah, seeing the holiness in sexuality has allowed for sexuality to be seen in an ethical way.

One aspect of sexuality that Jewish feminist ethicists challenge is the [[heterocentrism]] that is implicit in Judaism and in traditional texts. Plaskow in particular accuses the authorities that have led the development of Jewish tradition, creating and enforcing a system that condemns homosexuality and ignores lesbianism. She draws on her own experiences and identity, as well as different Jewish sources, in attempt to redefine human sexuality as open and fluid; she offers a re-reading of biblical texts as a means of defining a new ethical.

===Reproductive justice===
As reproductive justice is an integral part of feminist activism and essential to the movement, Jewish feminists feel they must address this ethical issue. While Jewish ethics has its own approach to reproductive justice, Jewish feminist ethics offer something different. There is the recognition for many that as a mother and especially as a Jewish mother&lt;ref&gt;Blu Greenberg. 1994. On Women and Judaism: A View from Tradition. Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt; it is hard for these writers to think about [[abortion]]. Beyond that, there is the recognition that as Jewish women, it is hard for many to claim direction over the bodies given how much of halakhah takes this agency away from women.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Plaskow. 1990 Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective. Harper. p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; There is the constant trouble of trying to find a balance between the needs of women and the demands of halakhah – abortion is no exception to this struggle of Jewish feminist ethics.

David Kraemer&lt;ref&gt;David Kraemer, "Jewish Ethics and Abortion," in Exploring Judaism: The Collected Essays of David Kraemer. Scholars Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; offers a perspective that suggests it is possible to derive an ethical from traditional sources that fall outside of the ways of Halakha. He argues that it is not about deciding what is and is not permissible; rather it is about the fundamental values embedded in the tradition and asking the right questions. He makes the distinction between legal proscription and ethical imperative. While this argument is not distinct to abortion, or even reproductive justice as a whole, Kraemer sees women's needs in direct opposition to the Halakha and therefore sees being pro-choice as essential and permissible regardless.

== Contributing philosophies ==
Many of the theologians, authors, and ethicists who represent Feminist Jewish Ethics were inspired and influenced by previous thinkers and philosophies.

=== Carol Gilligan ===
[[Carol Gilligan]] is an American Jewish feminist and ethicist whose work has significantly influenced the Feminist Jewish Ethics movement. In her psychological studies, Gilligan is concerned with male and female differences in moral development. In her book ''[[In a Different Voice]]'': Psychological Theory and Women's Development, Gilligan challenges preconceived notions, particularly in the field of psychology, that suggest that women lack the abilities to understand and make moral judgments. She argues that men and women take different approaches to defining morality, which she concludes after interviewing women about their respective definitions and approaches to morality. Her findings showed that women are more apologetic and generally feel they have an obligation to help and care for others and act morally, whereas males tend to see morality as a matter of justice and respecting the rights of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilligan|first=Carol|title=In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development|year=1982|publisher=Harvard UP|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Jewish ethicists have been influenced by Gilligan and have mentioned her in their respective works. In her book ''Expanding the Palace of Torah: Orthodoxy and Feminism'', author Tamar Ross argues for a continued conversation allowing for a gradual process through which Orthodoxy can come to expand itself to include feminist thought and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Tamar|title=Expanding the Palace of Torah: Orthodoxy and Feminism|year=2004|publisher=UP of New England|location=Hanover, Brandeis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross references Gilligan in order to define "feminism" simply for her readers and define "uniquely feminine ways of thinking", particularly when it comes to morality. Laurie Zoloth engages with Carol Gilligan's anthropological research and assertion that women experience the world differently from men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zoloth|first=Laurie|title=Health Care and the Ethics of Encounter: A Jewish Discussion of Social Justice|year=1999|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emmanuel Levinas===
[[Emmanuel Levinas]] was a French Jewish philosopher and Talmud Scholar who argues for the importance of a Jewish ethic. In his philosophical works he distinguishes between totality and infinity, the latter referring to the spiritual world. Levinas argues that infinity extends beyond totality. He associates totality with ontology, and infinity with ethics, prioritizing ethics over ontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=Deidre|title=DISTURBING BOUNDARIES: DEVELOPING JEWISH FEMINIST ETHICS WITH BUBER, LEVINAS AND FACKENHEIM|journal=Journal of Modern Jewish Studies|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levinas introduces the concept of the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]", arguing that the needs of "the Other" should come before oneself, or "the I".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raucher|first=Michal|title=Jewish Theological Seminary: Lecture|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deidre Butler—an author, professor, and feminist— examines Levinas from a feminist viewpoint. Butler is critical of Levinas in that he perpetuates [[binary opposition]]s, which place "feminine" and "masculine", and "self" and "other", on opposite ends of a spectrum. Butler asserts that "it is very difficult to disentangle a philosophical category that relies on stereotypes that both signal and enact the oppression and marginalization of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=Deidre|title=DISTURBING BOUNDARIES: DEVELOPING JEWISH FEMINIST ETHICS WITH BUBER, LEVINAS AND FACKENHEIM|journal=Journal of Modern Jewish Studies|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurie Zoloth, a medical ethics and religion professor at Northwestern University and author of ''Health Care and the Ethics of Encounter'', also draws upon the works of Levinas. In her book, Zoloth analyzes and criticizes the healthcare crisis in America, maintaining that we should turn to the Jewish tradition in order to guide us in creating an appropriate ethic. Zoloth draws on Levinas' ethical theory and concept of the 'other,' in order to contextualize that the healthcare crisis is a problem within a community. For Levinas, community is an organized group in which every individual sees himself or herself in relation to the 'other'. According to Zoloth, ethics cannot exist without a sense of community and the other; she stresses that ethical decisions are made with the 'other' in our consciousness. This thought is influenced by Levinas, who constantly stresses the importance of how one treats his or her neighbor, or the other. The concept of community and the 'other' also surrounds Jewish ethics because every individual is responsible for the 'other' and the community serves as a group of listeners; the voice of God also contains a sense of the 'other'. Zoloth explains that "the halakhic system uses the encounter with the Torah text and the encounter with the other's encounter with the text to create a continuous discursive community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zoloth|first=Laurie|title=Health Care and the Ethics of Encounter: A Jewish Discussion of Social Justice|year=1999|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist theory]] often describes women as being "otherized" – in a male-dominated culture, women are often viewed as "other" in relation to men.

===Martin Buber===
[[Martin Buber]] is a 20th-century philosopher who is known for his book ''[[I and Thou]]'', in which he outlines two different kinds of relationships. An "I-it" relationship consists of an individual's attitude toward an object and is something that said individual experiences. In contrast, an "I-Thou" relationship involves two people who are participating, rather than experiencing. While the "I-Thou" relationship is considered stronger, both types of relationship are significant and bring the individuals involved closer to God. 5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buber|first=Martin|title=I and Thou|year=1958|publisher=Scribnner|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; An I-Thou relationship must involve both parties, but not necessarily to an equal extent.

Many feminists see the "I-Thou" relationship as essential to feminist thought, as it requires being "attentive to the Thou and precludes treating the Other as one's object."3 Feminism, by definition, suggests an equal status and power relations among men and women. Therefore, in order to apply this theology to feminist thought, one must ensure that the relationship is equal, as Buber suggests that the relationship can be unbalanced in some situations. Thus, Buber's philosophy from a Jewish feminist lens must be appropriated to "preclude unethical power relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=Deidre|title=DISTURBING BOUNDARIES: DEVELOPING JEWISH FEMINIST ETHICS WITH BUBER, LEVINAS AND FACKENHEIM|journal=Journal of Modern Jewish Studies|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Cover===
[[Robert Cover]], a Yale law professor and scholar, has influenced many Jewish feminist ethicists, such as Rachel Adler. Cover suggests that there are two different types of law, imperialistic and jurisgenerative. Imperialistic law focuses on authority and the enforcement of rules, whereas jurisgenerative law constitutes communal ideas. Cover favors jurisgenerative style law in that it represents [[paidea]], the highest ideal of the community. Cover distinguishes what is and what ought to be: what exists, and what the ideal is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adler|first=Rachel|title=Engendering JudaismAn Inclusive Theology and Ethics|year=1998|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|location=Philadelphia, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rachel Adler]], a Jew who was raised orthodox and initially married orthodox, divorced and became reform and was ordained incorporates Cover's theologies. She claims that halakhah, or Jewish law, serves as the connection between past and present Jewish worlds. Adapting Cover's terms, Adler see imperialistic law as the way that halakhah currently functions and has functioned throughout time, according to Adler. Like Cover, however, Adler favors jurisgenerative law, as these are the ideals found in Adler's Master Narrative, or ethical ideal for the community. Unlike many other Jewish feminists, Adler does not reject [[halakhah]], despite her acknowledgement that women's voices were excluded from the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adler|first=Rachel|title=Engendering JudaismAn Inclusive Theology and Ethics|year=1998|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|location=Philadelphia, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermann Cohen===
[[Hermann Cohen]] was a philosopher who lived from 1842-1918 who held many of the same philosophical beliefs as Immanuel Kant, but applied to Judaism. Cohen also sees ethics as what "ought to be" in the social world, as opposed to seeing what "is" as a current state of affairs that is unchangeable. According to Cohen, only God falls into both categories of what "is" and what "ought to be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raucher|first=Michal|title=Jewish Theological Seminary: Lecture|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cohen, ethics are equivalent to what ought to be. Jewish feminist ethicists have use Cohen's Kantian ideas by expressing their ideals for equality for women in Judaism as what ought to be.

===Sigmund Freud===
[[Sigmund Freud]], an Austrian psychologist and psychoanalyst who lived from 1856 to 1939. Freud's psychology still serves as the basis for psychological studies today. Tova Hartman, a professor, ethicist, and psychologist, studies Freud and incorporates some of his research into her book Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism: Resistance and Accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartman|first=Tova|title=Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism: Resistance and Accommodation|year=2007|publisher=Brandeis UP|location=Waltham, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hartman introduces three models of understanding Freudian concepts. She suggests that these models—the reaffirmation, reinterpretation/revisionist, and the rejection model—should be utilized to understand the Canon from a more feminist lens. The reaffirmation model suggests that any idea, so long as someone 'authoritative' posits it, should be accepted as true. This is problematic in a Jewish context in that it denotes that the canonical text and its authors are the sole authorities. The reinterpretation/revisionist model entails reappropriating and lending new meaning to concepts in the text without losing the value of the original context. When applying these models to the Jewish canon, Hartman favors the reinterpretation/revisionist approach for Jewish education, as it is the one that most "challenges its adherents to be in a constant state of engaging and reengaging with the traditional texts". The rejection model is also not ideal in that it would completely reject the entire Canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartman|first=Tova|title=Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism: Resistance and Accommodation|year=2007|publisher=Brandeis UP|location=Waltham, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Womanist and Mujerista theologies ===
[[Womanism]] and [[Mujerista]] theologies have influenced scholars such as Rabbi Donna Berman, whose dissertation, Nashiut Ethics: Articulating a Jewish Feminist Ethics of Safekeeping, describes a new ethical approach to Jewish feminism. Nashiut Ethics is a form of Jewish Feminist Ethics that Berman develops that focuses not on Torah or halakhah, which she claims have "otherized" the woman's narrative, but on stories and experiences of women who have been neglected within the Jewish tradition. Like Nashiut ethics, womanist and mujerista theologies provide voices to justice-seeking women who have been neglected within their respective racial, ethnic, and religious groups.

Womanism is the movement that seeks to eliminate gender oppression specifically for black women. The movement incorporates literature, ethics, history, and everyday experiences, all of which focus on the black woman's narrative. [[Katie Geneva Cannon|Katie Cannon]], in particular, is associated with the origins of the womanist movement. Cannon asserts that Black Women's voices have historically been ignored; she is one of many women in the womanist movement who was not ashamed to be perceived as radical or take risks. Nashiut ethics is inspired by this model for this reason. Berman asserts that, "Nashiut ethics, like womanist ethics, involves a transvaluation of values, a reclaiming of that which has been repressed and punished in the name of preserving a male constructed femininity which fosters the perpetuation of male power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=Donna|title=Nashiut Ethics|year=2001|publisher=Diss.|location=Drew University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the same lines, mujerista theology provides insight into the perspectives, history, literature, and experiences of American Latina women. [[Ada Maria Isasi-Diaz]], the theologian who founded the movement, is known for her use of ethnographic interviews of Latina women in her mujerista works. Influenced by Diaz, Berman makes use of ethnography in her dissertation to shed light on the neglected women's voices in [[Rabbinic Judaism]].

Donna Berman specifies, that, like womanist and mujerista theologies, the purpose of Nashiut ethics is to create a place for women who have been neglected and "otherized" in history. Nashiut ethics incorporates the narratives of the feminist African American and Hispanic communities, as she is committed to creating equality and a voice for "every faith and racial/ethnic group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=Donna|title=Nashiut Ethics|year=2001|publisher=Diss.|location=Drew University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
While most [[Jews|Jewish]] [[feminism|feminist]] ethicists and thinkers agree that [[Judaism]] can be inadequate to the requirements of feminism, many have oppositional views towards methods of solving this problem, and are thus critical of each other's works. Some of this criticism occurs overtly, but much of it does not reference a specific author. Rather the criticism remains assumed; when one author puts forth an idea that disagrees with that of another, it can be understood to be a criticism of the other's work.

=== Modes of Criticism ===

For the most part, [[Jewish feminism|Jewish feminist]] thinkers seem to avoid specifically criticizing each other. Even authors like [[Tova Hartman]] and [[Rachel Adler]], whose theologies and ideas are very dissimilar, avoid criticizing the other openly. While they disagree with each other's methodologies and opinions (see above), and respond to each other's works, open criticism is kept to a minimum within the genre.

References to other authors are most often used as positive examples, and focus on the commonalities between works, rather than the differences.&lt;ref&gt;Tova Hartman. 2007. Feminism encounters traditional Judaism: resistance and accommodation. Brandeis University Press. p113&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreeing authors, rather than attacking the works of another, will often let their works speak for themselves, setting themselves up as another option in thought, rather than an opponents. Despite the great divides in opinion, and the many disagreements, actual criticism rarely occurs.

=== Specific moments of criticism ===

==== Feminist liturgical methods ====
Many Jewish feminist thinkers, including [[Judith Plaskow]] and Rachel Adler support the addition of female centered language into the [[Jewish prayer|liturgy]].&lt;ref&gt;Judith Plaskow. 1990 Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective. Harper. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors disagree with this premise. [[Cynthia Ozick]], for example, is very critical of this technique, and argues that using female god language would be equivalent to the reassumption of [[idolatry]]. For her, referring to God as "Queen of the universe" (rather than "King of the universe" harkens back to the fertility cults of ancient [[Mother goddess|goddesses]], and would be unacceptable. Plaskow adamantly disagrees with Ozick here. In her work ''Standing Again at Sinai'', Plaskow criticizes Ozick's arguments, saying that these new prayers do not set up a Goddess next to God, but rather expand God's image.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Plaskow. 1990. Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective. Harper. p. 149-150&lt;/ref&gt;

====Feminist theologies====
Plaskow, Adler, and Ozick often criticized each other's works, using essays to respond to each other. Plaskow's article "The Right Question is Theological" is a refutation of Adler's "The Jew Who Wasn't There" and Ozick's "Notes Toward the Right Direction."&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adler. 1998. Engendering Judaism: an Inclusive Theology and Ethics. The Jewish Publication Society. p.xxi&lt;/ref&gt; In her article, Plaskow criticizes Ozick and Adler for being too focused on making changes to [[halakha]] to fit feminist needs, and for not discussing the Judaism's underlying [[Theology|theological]] problems. Plaskow is especially critical of Ozick's 1979 article"Notes toward finding the right question," in which Ozick argues that Judaism does not inherently subordinate women, but rather that the subordination Jewish women face come from "historical custom and practice." In her article, Plaskow argues against this statement, saying that Judaism's underlying theology is problematic in and of itself. But in her discussion of Ozick, Plaskow is less critical of Ozick's ideas than of her silence on the issue of theology. Plaskow wants to expand the discussion on theology; it is Ozick's unwillingness to do so that prompts Plaskow's criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Plaskow. (1990). The Right Question Is Theological.&lt;/ref&gt; Adler responded to the criticism that she was overly focused on halakha by writing first an article, then a book, outlying ideas regarding Jewish feminist theology.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adler. 1998. Engendering Judaism: an Inclusive Theology and Ethics. The Jewish Publication Society. p.xxi&lt;/ref&gt;

The government generally respects religious freedom for the six officially recognized religions:  [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], [[Catholicism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]].

According to [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide]] religious intolerance is increasing and spreading nationwide, even between Muslim groups.&lt;ref name=ChristianSolidarityWorldwide&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csw.org.uk/2014/02/14/report/179/article.htm |title=Indonesia Report Pluralism in Peril}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious demography==

According to the 2010 census, 87% percent of the population is Muslim, 7% Protestant, 3% Catholic, 2% Hindu, 1% Buddhist, &lt;1% Confucianism, &lt;1% other, and &lt;1% unstated or not asked.&lt;ref name="sp2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&amp;wid=0 |title=Penduduk Menurut Wilayah dan Agama yang Dianut |date=15 May 2010 |work=Sensus Penduduk 2010 |publisher=Badan Pusat Statistik |location=Jakarta, Indonesia |at= |trans-title=Population by Region and Religion |accessdate=20 November 2011 |quote=Religion is belief in Almighty God that must be possessed by every human being.

Most Muslims in the country are Sunni. The two largest Muslim social organizations, Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah, claimed 40 million and 30 million Sunni followers, respectively. There are also an estimated one million to three million Shi'a Muslims.&lt;ref name="Indonesia State Dept." /&gt;

==Legal framework==
{{Further|Blasphemy law in Indonesia}}
The constitution provides for freedom of religion, accords "all persons the right to worship according to their own religion or belief," and states that "the nation is based upon belief in one supreme God." The first tenet of the country's national ideology, [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]], similarly declares belief in one God. The government does not allow for not believing in God. Government employees must swear allegiance to the nation and to the Pancasila ideology. Other laws and policies placed restrictions on certain types of religious activity, particularly among unrecognized religious groups and "deviant" sects of recognized religious groups. The central government did not invoke its constitutional authority to review or revoke local laws that violated freedom of religion.

Aceh remained the only province authorized by the central government to implement Islamic law (Shari'a), and non-Muslims in the province remained exempt from Shari'a. Some local governments outside of Aceh also have laws with elements of Shari'a that abrogate certain rights of women and religious minorities. Aceh adopted a Shari'a based penal code imposing physical punishment for violations.

The Ministry of Religious Affairs extends official status to six religious groups: Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Confucianism. Unrecognized groups may register with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism as social organizations. Although these groups have the right to establish a house of worship, obtain identity cards, and register marriages and births, they sometimes face administrative difficulties in doing so. In some cases these challenges make it more difficult for individuals to find jobs or enroll children in school. Legally, identity card applications are now acceptable when the "religion" section is left blank; however, members of some groups reported that they sometimes faced obstacles.&lt;ref name="Indonesia State Dept." /&gt;

The three decades long ban on freedom to organize was lifted from the [[Bahá'í Faith]] the year 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=World Religion News|first1=(2014)|title=Indonesia to Officially Recognize Baha'i in Increasing Tolerance|url=http://www.worldreligionnews.com/issues/indonesia-officially-recognize-bahai-increasing-tolerance|website=Worldreligionnews.com|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Bahá'í believers are not allowed to have outreach activities and must organize their meetings only within the Bahá'í community. Bahá'í is tolerated, but it is understood that it may not expand. Activities such as door to door transmission, events open for non-Bahá'ís and spreading of brochures are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bahá'í Activities in Indonesia (Asmoro Gunawan)|title=Bahá'ís arrested in Indonesia on Criminal Charges of violating "The Law of Child Protection"|url=http://agamabahai.blogspot.se/2011/03/bahais-arrested-in-indonesia-on.html|website=http://agamabahai.blogspot.se/|publisher=Kegiatan Agama Baha'i di Indonesia|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website has repeatedly been switched off, and the Bahá'í center in Jakarta was abandoned during most of 2013 and 2014

==Conflicts over minority houses of worship==

The 2006 [[Revised Joint Ministerial Decrees on Construction of Houses of Worship]], which has been criticized as unconstitutional, requires any group attempting to build a house of worship to obtain signatures from 90 potential members, 60 households of a different faith, and various local authorities.

[[Amnesty International]] reports that the [[Ahmadiyya]] community is increasingly targeted and at least four provinces issued new regional regulations restricting Ahmadiyya activities.  By the end of 2011, at least 18 Christian churches had been attacked or forced to shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/indonesia/report-2012|work=Annual Report 2012|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Shi'a Muslims are at increased risk of attack and are being pressured by anti-Shi'a groups to convert to Sunni Islam.&lt;ref name="Shi'a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shi'a Muslims at risk of attacks in Indonesia|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa21/002/2012/en/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Ahmadiyya, according to the Indonesian Communion of Churches and the [[Wahid Institute]], local government officials and local communities forced the closing of at least 28 licensed and unlicensed churches during the reporting period. Many of the targeted churches operated in private homes and storefronts, and some churches moved their services to rented spaces in public shopping malls to lessen the potential of threats from hardline groups.&lt;ref name="Indonesia State Dept." /&gt;

Examples of clashes:

*On the morning of 22 April 2012, around 100 members of the Filadelfia Batak Christian Protestant Church (Huria Kristen Batak Protestan, HKBP) were prevented from going to their church to conduct the Sunday service. They were blocked by officers from the Bekasi municipal administrative police (Satpol PP), North Tambun sub-district police and other local government officials, who tried to persuade them to move to a place around nine kilometres away. Unable to access the church, the congregation began to conduct their service by the road. Around 500 protestors who had gathered earlier near the church surrounded them, began threatening them and demanded that they leave. Some apparently tried to attack the worshippers, but were blocked by the police. The protestors only dispersed after more police officers arrived, and a municipal administrative police officer fired a shot in the air. The previous Sunday, protestors had also blocked congregation members from getting to the church, forcing them to worship by the road. Instead of dispersing or detaining the protestors who were threatening the congregation, the police tried to pressure the worshippers to leave the area. After the service, one of protestors threatened the church leader, saying, "You're finished if you try coming back!" Members of the congregation fear that without adequate police protection, they will be intimidated and attacked at future Sunday services.&lt;ref name=Demand&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia:  demand protection for church congregation|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa21/018/2012/en/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Taman Yasmin Indonesian Christian Church in [[Bogor]], a majority-Muslim area, started a lengthy permitting process for their church in 2003, obtaining all the needed permission.  Under popular pressure, local authorities froze the permits.  The congregation appealed all the way to the [[Supreme Court of Indonesia]] and won in 2011.  Local authorities complied with the ruling to unfreeze the permits, but then cancelled them entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/12/07/church-relocation-threatens-pluralism-gki-yasmin.html Church relocation threatens pluralism: GKI Yasmin]&lt;/ref&gt; The partially completed building has been sealed by local authorities and declared off-limits.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/11/01/560012788/its-our-right-christian-congregation-in-indonesia-fights-to-worship-in-its-churc 'It's Our Right': Christian Congregation In Indonesia Fights To Worship In Its Church]&lt;/ref&gt; The group celebrated a secret Christmas ceremony in 2010,&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; but in general since 2008 has been forced to hold weekly services on the pavement outside the church.  One service, on 22 January 2012, was disrupted by two groups - the Islamic Reform Movement and the Muslim Communications Forum - who held a protest, shouted at the Christian group, blocked the road with tree branches and wooden chairs, and eventually forced the group to leave under police protection.&lt;ref name=Further&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia:  further information:  fears for church congregation continue|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa21/004/2012/en/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2015, about 8,000 Christians fled Aceh province when a Muslim mob torched a church; authorities later agreed to demolish 10 churches without permits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2015/10/church-attack-routs-thousands-of-indonesian-christians/ Church attack routs thousands of Indonesian Christians]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ahmadiyya mosques have been closed in various areas using the 2006 law, with Sunni Muslims complaining the group is heretical and should not be claiming to be practice Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Java,-Ahmadi-mosque-shut-down-28566.html Java, Ahmadi mosque shut down]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://themuslimtimes.info/2016/07/30/indonesia-catholic-church-criticizes-forced-closure-of-ahmadi-mosque/comment-page-1/ Indonesia: Catholic Church criticizes forced-closure of Ahmadi Mosque]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csw.org.uk/2014/5/28/news/2119/article.htm MOSQUES AND CHURCHES CLOSED IN INDONESIA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suppression of Ahmadiyya==
{{further|Ahmadiyya in Indonesia}}
In 2010, controversy over the Ahmadiyya continued with hardline groups renewing attacks and demanding that the government disband the Ahmadiyya. Rallies continued throughout the country both for and against a ban. Civil rights activists, members of the Presidential Advisory Council, and leaders from Muhammadiyah and Nadhlatul Ulama continued to assert that any such ban would be unconstitutional and contrary to the principles of Islam.

==Suppression of Shi'a==
[[Tajul Muluk]], a Shi'a Muslim religious leader from East Java, was sentenced on 12 July 2012, to two years' imprisonment for blasphemy by the Sampang District Court. Tajul Muluk was displaced with over 300 other Shi'a villagers on 29 December 2011, when an anti-Shi'a mob of some 500 people attacked and burned houses, a boarding school and a Shi'a place of worship in Nangkrenang village, Sampang, Madura island. Only one person was charged and sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for the attacks. Afterwards most of the Shi'a displaced by the attack returned to Nangkrenang village. But Tajul Muluk and about 20 other villagers, including his family, were prevented from returning to the village by the attackers, who reportedly threatened to kill them if they returned, and by the police.

On 1 January 2012 a religious decree (fatwa) was issued by the Sampang branch of the Indonesia Ulema Council (MUI) about what they described as Tajul Muluk's "deviant teachings", and two days later a police report was filed against him. On 16 March, the East Java regional police charged Tajul Muluk with blasphemy under Article 156(a) of the Indonesian Criminal Code, and with "offensive actions" under Article 335 of the Code. The indictment accused Tajul Muluk of telling his followers that the Qur'an is not the authentic text of Islam. His trial began at the Sampang District Court on 24 April 2012 and he was sentenced to two years in prison on 12 July 2012 under Article 156(a). Following the verdict Tajul Muluk reportedly said he would lodge an appeal.&lt;ref name="Shi'a leader"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia:  Shi'a leader imprisoned for blasphemy must be released|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa21/025/2012/en/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He allegedly posted statements and pictures which some people construed as insulting Islam and the prophet Mohammad. On 18 January 2012 an angry crowd who had heard about his alleged Facebook posts gathered at his workplace and threatened to beat him. Police officers intervened and took him to the Pulau Punjung Sub-District police station for his safety. On 20 January he was charged for "disseminating information aimed at inciting religious hatred or hostility" under Article 28 (2) of the Electronic Information and Transaction (ITE) Law, religious blasphemy under Article 156a(a) of the Indonesian Criminal Code and calling for others to embrace atheism under Article 156a(b) of the same code. His trial began at the Muaro District Court on 2 April 2012.

==2010 developments==

According to the U.S. State Department's 2010 report on the status of religious freedom in Indonesia,&lt;ref name="Indonesia State Dept." /&gt; there were numerous areas of improvements in religious freedom during that year. Representatives of the Confucian community continued to practice their religion freely as well as obtain marriage certificates and identity cards with Confucianism listed as their religion.

Local government officials in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) recognized the marriages of Ahmadiyya followers. Officials from the NTB Department of Religion conducted weddings in the Ahmadiyya Transito Camp for Ahmadiyya couples and recorded and issued marriage certificates. Ahmadiyya followers experienced little or no difficulty registering their marriages or getting marriage certificates during the reporting period.

In Maluku, despite new incidents of violence during the reporting period, leaders of both the Muslim and Christian communities and the Maluku provincial government continued to demonstrate strong commitment to easing religious tension and rebuilding the community.&lt;ref name="Indonesia State Dept." /&gt;

By contrast a report from [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide]] suggests intolerance is increasing.&lt;ref name=ChristianSolidarityWorldwide/&gt;

==State-sponsored Muslim migrations in Christian areas==
Evidences from international human rights organization including [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] found that the Indonesian government has been sponsoring migrations of Muslims from Java and other Muslim-majority provinces into Christian areas such as Papua, West Papua, North Sulawesi, West Sulawesi, Muluku, East Nusa Tenggara, and West Nusa Tenggara in an attempt to dislodge Christian and indigenous minorities and to block separatist attempts. International media has been banned from reporting the migrations, especially in the western part of New Guinea, where international media was blocked in Papua and West Papua by Jakarta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanahku.west-papua.nl/index.php/component/content/article/313.html|title=Bringing Islam to Papua|first=|last=Administrator|website=tanahku.West-Papua.nl|access-date=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gabr''' ({{lang-fa|گبر}}) (also ''geuber'', ''geubre'', ''gabrak'', ''gawr'', ''gaur'', ''gyaur'', ''gabre'') is a [[Persian language|New Persian]] term originally used to denote a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]].

Historically, ''gabr'' was a technical term synonymous with ''mōg'', "[[magi|magus]]", denoting a follower of [[Zoroastrianism]], and it is with this meaning that the term is attested in very early New Persian texts such as the ''[[Shahnameh]]''. In time, ''gabr'' came to have a pejorative implication and was superseded in literature by the respectable ''Zardoshti'', "Zoroastrian".

By the 13th century the word had come to be applied to a follower of any religion other than [[Islam]], and it has "also been used by the Muslim [[Kurds]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], and some other ethnic groups in modified forms to denote various religious communities other than Zoroastrians, sometimes even in the sense of [[infidel|unbeliever]]."&lt;ref name="Shaki"&gt;{{citation|last=Shaki|first=Mansour|chapter=Gabr|title=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=10|year=2001|location=Costa Mesa|publisher=Mazda|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gabr-}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the curtailment of social rights, non-Muslims were compelled to live in restricted areas, which the Muslim populace referred to as ''Gabristan''s.&lt;ref name="Savory"&gt;{{citation|title=Relations between the Safavid State and its Non-Muslim Minorities|last=Savory|first=R. M.|journal=Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations|volume=14|issue=4|year=2003|pages=435–458|doi=10.1080/0959641032000127597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Ottoman Empire, the Turkish version ''gâvur'', borrowed into English via French as "[[giaour]]", was used to refer to Christians. This is sometimes still used today in former Ottoman territories and carries a strong pejorative meaning.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

The etymology of the term is uncertain. "In all likelihood,"&lt;ref name="Shaki" /&gt; ''gabr'' derives from the [[Aramaic language#Imperial Aramaic|Aramaic]] ''gabrā'', spelt ''GBRʼ'', which – in written [[Middle Iranian languages]] – serves as an ideogram that would be read as an Iranian language word meaning "man." (for the use of ideograms in Middle Iranian languages, see ''[[Pahlavi scripts]]''). During the [[Sasanian Empire]] (226-651), the ideogram signified a free (i.e. non-slave) peasant of [[Mesopotamia]]. Following the collapse of the empire and the subsequent rise of Islam, it "seems likely that ''gabr'' used already in Sassanian times in reference to a section of Zoroastrian community in Mesopotamia, had been employed by the converted [[Fars Province|Persians]] in the Islamic period to indicate their Zoroastrian compatriots, a practice that later spread throughout the country."&lt;ref name="Shaki" /&gt;

It has also been suggested that ''gabr'' might be a mispronunciation of Arabic ''[[kafir]]'' "unbeliever," but this theory has been rejected on linguistic grounds both phonetic and semantic: "there is no unusual sound in ''kafir'' that would require phonetic modification",&lt;ref name="Shaki" /&gt; and ''kafir'' as a generic word probably would not refer to a specific revealed religion such as Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref name="Shaki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bausani"&gt;{{citation|last=Bausani|first=A.|chapter=Gabr|title=Encyclopedia of Islam| edition=2|volume=II|year=1965|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill&lt;!--|pages=970–971--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''genizah''' (or '''geniza'''; [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{hbrgimel}}{{hbrnun}}{{hbryud}}{{hbrzayin}}{{hbrhe}} "storage"; plural: '''genizot''' or '''genizoth''' or '''genizahs''')&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary,'' 1961&lt;/ref&gt; is a storage area in a [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[synagogue]] or cemetery designated for the temporary storage of worn-out Hebrew-language books and papers on religious topics prior to proper cemetery burial.

==Etymology==
The word ''genizah'' comes from the [[Semitic root|Hebrew triconsonantal root]] ''g-n-z'', which means "hiding", and originally meant "to hide" or "to put away".&lt;ref name=katz&gt;Katzover, Yisrael. "The Genizah on the Nile". ''[[Hamodia]]'' Features, April 21, 2016, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it became a noun for a place where one put things, and is perhaps best translated as "archive" or "repository".

==Description==
[[File:Zeravshan Okrug. Samarkand. A Genizah in a Synagogue WDL11134.png|thumb|A genizah in a synagogue ([[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan, ca. 1865-72)]]

Genizot are temporary repositories designated for the storage of worn-out [[Hebrew language]] books and papers on religious topics prior to proper cemetery burial, it being forbidden to throw away writings containing the name of God. As even personal letters and legal contracts may open with an invocation of God, the contents of genizot have not been limited to religious materials; in practice, they have also contained writings of a secular nature, with or without the customary opening invocation, as well as writings in other [[Jewish languages]] that use the Hebrew alphabet (the [[Judeo-Arabic languages]], [[Judeo-Persian]], [[Judaeo-Spanish]], and [[Yiddish]]).

Genizot are typically found in the attic or basement of a [[synagogue]],  but can also be in walls or buried underground.  They may also be located in cemeteries.&lt;ref name=katz/&gt;

The contents of genizot are periodically gathered solemnly and then buried in the cemetery or ''bet ḥayyim''. Synagogues in [[Jerusalem]] buried the contents of their genizot every seventh year, as well as during a year of drought, believing that this would bring rain. This custom is associated with the far older practice of burying a great or good man with a [[Sefer (Hebrew)|''sefer'']] (either a book of the [[Tanakh]], or the [[Mishnah]], the [[Talmud]], or any work of [[rabbinic literature]]) which has become ''pasul'' (unfit for use through illegibility or old age). The tradition of paper-interment is known to have been practiced in Morocco, Algiers, Turkey, Yemen and Egypt.

==History==
[[File:Synagogue massada 3.jpg|thumb|A possible geniza at [[Masada]], eastern Israel]]

The [[Talmud]] (Tractate [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 115a) directs that holy writings in other than the Hebrew language require ''genizah'', that is, preservation. In Tractate [[Pesachim (Talmud)|Pesachim]] 118b, ''bet genizah'' is a treasury. In Pesachim 56a, [[Hezekiah]] hides (''ganaz'') a medical work; in Shabbat 115a, [[Gamaliel]] orders that the [[targum]] to the [[Book of Job]] should be hidden (''yigganez'') under the ''nidbak'' (layer of stones). In Shabbat 30b, there is a reference to those rabbis who sought to categorize the books of Ecclesiastes and Proverbs as heretical; this occurred before the canonization of the [[Hebrew Bible]], when disputes flared over which books should be considered Biblical. The same thing occurs in Shabbat 13b in regard to the Book of Ezekiel, and in Pesachim 62 in regard to the Book of Genealogies.

In medieval times, Hebrew scraps and papers that were relegated to the genizah were known as ''shemot'' "names," because their sanctity and consequent claim to preservation were held to depend on their containing the "names" of God. In addition to papers, articles connected with ritual, such as [[tzitzit]], [[lulav]]im, and sprigs of myrtle, are similarly stored.

According to folklore, these scraps were used to hide the famed [[Golem#The classic narrative: The Golem of Prague|Golem of Prague]], whose body is claimed to lie in the genizah of the [[Old New Synagogue]] in Prague.

[[File:TaggedGeniza.jpg|thumb|Modern genizah collection receptacle on street in [[Nachlaot]], [[Jerusalem]]]]
By far, the best-known genizah, which is famous for both its size and spectacular contents, is the [[Cairo Geniza]]. Recognized for its importance and introduced to the Western world in 1864 by [[Jacob Saphir]], and chiefly studied by [[Solomon Schechter]] and [[Shelomo Dov Goitein]], the genizah had an accumulation of almost 280,000 Jewish manuscript fragments dating from 870 to the [[19th century]]. These materials were important for reconstructing the religious, social and economic history of Jews, especially in the Middle Ages. For all practical purposes, the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], discovered between the years 1946 and 1956, belonged to a genizah from the 2nd-century BCE. 

In 1927, a manuscript containing [[Nathan ben Abraham I|Nathan ben Abraham]]'s 11th-century [[Mishnah]] commentary was discovered in the genizah of the Jewish community of [[Sana'a]], Yemen. Nathan had served as ''President of the Academy'' under the revised [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] ''[[Geonic period|geonate]]'', shortly before its demise in the early 12th century CE. In 2011, the so-called [[Afghan Geniza]], an [[11th century]] collection of manuscript fragments in Hebrew, Aramaic, Judaeo-Arabic and Judeo-Persian, was found in Afghanistan, in caves used by the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref name=CBSNews&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient manuscripts indicate Jewish community once thrived in Afghanistan|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ancient-manuscripts-indicate-jewish-community-once-thrived-in-afghanistan/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2011}}
'''Heterodoxy''' in a religious sense means "any opinions or doctrines at variance with an official or [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] position".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=heterodoxy Definition of orthodoxy from]&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, heterodoxy is similar to unorthodoxy, while the adjective "heterodox" could be applied to a [[dissident]].

Heterodoxy is also an ecclesiastical [[Technical terminology|term of art]], defined in various ways by different religions and churches. For example, in the [[apostolic succession|Apostolic Churches]]  (the [[Orthodox Church]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Church of the East]], the [[Anglican Communion]], and the [[Non-Chalcedonianism|Non-Chalcedonian]] or [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Churches]]), heterodoxy may describe beliefs that differ from strictly orthodox views, but that fall short either of formal or of material [[heresy]].

==Ecclesiastic usage==

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
In the [[Orthodox Church]], the term is used primarily in reference to Christian churches and [[Christian denomination|denominations]] not belonging to the Communion of Eastern Orthodox Churches and espousing doctrines contrary to the received [[Holy Tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Orthodox Dogmatic Theology, by Fr. Michael Pomazansky, trans. by Fr. Seraphim Rose (Platina, CA: St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, 1994), pp. 243-246&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it describes any theological position, moral principle, spiritual practice, or lifestyle thought to be inconsistent with the catholic [[Rule of Faith]]. In general, this term is used in two distinct senses:
# to label a theological system or viewpoint which, although erroneous and unacceptable to hold or promote within Orthodoxy, has not been formally defined as heresy.
# to label a theological system or viewpoint which is both contrary to Orthodoxy and whose adherents have not been baptized into the Church, so that the attribution of heresy would be improper.

===Roman Catholicism===
Heterodoxy in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] refers to views that differ from strictly orthodox views, but retain sufficient faithfulness to the original doctrine to avoid [[heresy]]. Many Roman Catholics profess some heterodox views, either on doctrinal or social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Hornsby-Smith, Raymond M. Lee and Peter A. Reilly (1985). "Common Religion and Customary Religion: A Critique and a Proposal". ''Review of Religious Research 26(3)'', 244-252.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the orthodox Catholic position on unbaptized infants is that their fate is uncertain, and "the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God" (Catechism of the Catholic Church 1261). A heterodox Catholic might profess the belief that unbaptized infants are allotted to [[Limbo]] and then offered the option to accept or deny salvation by God at their judgment. The belief is not orthodox, as the Church does not profess a belief as to what happens to unbaptized infants; however, it is also not heresy, as the Church accepts that such a scenario ''might'' be possible.

===Protestantism===
Many [[Protestants]], such as [[Lutherans]], use the term ''heterodox'' to describe Christian teachings which are not in agreement with their understanding of scripture.  As [[Charles Spurgeon]] said:

:''...you shall find spiritual life in every church. I know it is the notion of the bigot, that all the truly godly people belong to the denomination which he adorns. Orthodoxy is my doxy; heterodoxy is anybody else’s doxy who does not agree with me.&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Spurgeon, The Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit Sermons, vol. 17 (London: Passmore &amp; Alabaster, 1871), 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''[[ghulat]]'' is used by Shia Muslims for beliefs perceived as being extremely heterodox (more in line with the Christian use of the word "heresy"). In particular, the term is used to describe the beliefs of minority Muslim groups who ascribe divine characteristics to a member of [[Muhammad]]'s family (especially [[Ali]]) or the early [[Sahabah|companions of the Prophet]] such as [[Salman the Persian]].  The assumption is that the groups thus described have gone too far and have come to associate them with God (''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'').

[[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam]] Muslims see each other as heterodox, differing in practice mainly on matters of jurisprudence or ''[[fiqh]]'', splitting historically on the matter of the succession of [[Ali]] to the caliphate by [[Muawiyah]]. A third and much smaller movement is [[Ibadi]], which differ from both of these groups on a few key points. Several ultra-orthodox groups such as the [[Wahhabis]], in turn, see themselves as the only truly orthodox groups within Islam.

The Shia [[Ismailis]], who in turn split from the Shia mainstream of [[Twelvers]] over another succession dispute, have subsumed several groups which the majority of Muslims view as heterodox, such as the [[Seveners]], and [[gnostic]]-influenced [[Alawites]], and many other [[religious sect|sects]] and subsects. The gnostic-influenced [[Druze]] sect has also been affiliated with the Ismailis, but some of its followers go so far as to see it as a [[religious denomination|distinct religion]] altogether. The [[Sufis]], divided into many [[List of Sufi orders|sects and orders]], incorporate many [[mysticism|mystical]] [[doctrine]]s and [[religious ritual|rituals]] into Islam, but many also consider themselves Shi'i or Sunnis. Another Shia group, influenced heavily by the Sufis, [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] religion and other mystical movements, is that of the [[Alevi]]. Historical groups viewed as highly heterodox by most Muslims include the [[Kharijites]], who took a third view on Ali's succession (and are today succeeded by the [[Ibadi]]), the [[Mu'tazili]]tes, who most famously asserted that the [[Qur'an]] was created, a view which enjoyed [[Caliph]]al approval before the time of [[Mutawakkil]], the [[Qarmatians]], a branch of the [[Seveners]] within Ismaili Islam who took control of much of the [[Arabian peninsula]] in the 9th and 10th century, practiced [[vegetarianism]], attacked [[Hajj]] pilgrims and took control of the [[Well of Zamzam]] and the [[Black Stone]] before their decline, and the [[Hashashin]] or [[Assassin]]s, another Ismaili group, famous for their reclusive lifestyle, manners of indoctrination and assassinations in the years after the [[First Crusade]].

According to [[Philip Hitti]],&lt;ref&gt;"History of the Arabs", Philip Khuri Hitti, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] [[caliphate]]s there was a marked tendency among several quite unrelated heterodox groups to affiliate themselves with the Shiites, particularly the Ismailis, in a general feeling of heterodox solidarity in a Sunni-controlled empire. The cause of the [[Alids]] thus became a rallying point for a diverse range of heterodox Islamic movements. The view that [[Ali]] was divine, though never mainstream within Shiism, is attested in the early centuries of Islam.

Two more recent movements seen as particularly at odds with the majority Muslim view are the [[Ahmadiyya]] and [[Nation of Islam]] movements. Many followers of the former consider its 19th-century founder, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], to have been a [[prophet]], as well as such other religious figures as [[Krishna]] and [[Buddha]], despite the mainstream Muslim view that [[Muhammad]] [[Seal of the Prophets|was the last]]. Both Ahmadi denominations consider Ahmad to have been the [[Mahdi]] and [[second coming of Jesus]]. The Nation of Islam is a movement which acknowledges its 20th-century founder, [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]], as an incarnation of [[Allah]], a view most Muslims consider [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] (polytheism). [[Bábism]] (most followers of which came to follow [[Baha'u'llah]] and became the [[Baha'i]]s) is viewed by many non-followers as originally having been a highly divergent movement within the Twelver Ismailism practiced in 19th-century Persia. Beyond heterodoxy, many elements of Islam have been incorporated into distinct belief systems several times, most specifically into [[Sikhism]] and the [[Baha'i Faith]], whose predecessor movement was [[Bábism]]. As a more unusual example, several [[Thuggee]] were self-reportedly Muslims, and according to [[William Sleeman]] equated the Hindu goddess [[Kali]] with [[Fatima bint Muhammad|Fatima]], a daughter of Muhammad.

==Political usage against religion==

===China===
In late 1999 legislation was created in China to outlaw "heterodox religions".&lt;ref&gt;Leung, Beatrice (2002) 'China and Falun Gong: Party and society relations in the modern era', Journal of Contemporary China, 11:33, 761 – 784&lt;/ref&gt; This was applied retroactively to [[Falun Gong]], a spiritual practice introduced to the public in China by Li Hongzhi (李洪志) in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cecc.gov/pages/roundtables/052305/Ownby.php Statement of Professor David Ownby] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326193222/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/roundtables/052305/Ownby.php |date=2008-03-26 }}, Unofficial Religions in China: Beyond the Party's Rules, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-ecclesiastic usage==

===Economics===

[[File:Arvid Liljelund - Man Singing Hymn - A I 187 - Finnish National Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[Arvid Liljelund]]'s ''Man Singing Hymn'' (1884)]]
A '''hymn''' is a type of [[song]], usually [[religious]], specifically written for the purpose of adoration or [[prayer]], and typically addressed to a [[deity]] or deities, or to a prominent figure or [[personification]]. The word ''hymn'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὕμνος}} (''hymnos''), which means "a song of praise". A writer of hymns is known as a [[hymnodist]]. The singing or composition of hymns is called '''hymnody'''. Collections of hymns are known as [[hymnal]]s or hymn books. Hymns may or may not include instrumental accompaniment.

Although most familiar to speakers of English in the context of [[Christianity]], hymns are also a fixture of other [[major religious groups|world religions]], especially on the Indian subcontinent. Hymns also survive from antiquity, especially from Egyptian and Greek cultures. Some of the oldest surviving examples of notated music are hymns with Greek texts.

==Origins==
Ancient hymns include the [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]'', composed by [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]]; the Hurrian [[Hymn to Nikkal]]; the ''[[Vedas]]'', a collection of hymns in the tradition of [[Hinduism]]; and the [[Psalms]], a collection of songs from [[Judaism]]. The Western tradition of hymnody begins with the [[Homeric Hymns]], a collection of ancient Greek hymns, the oldest of which were written in the 7th century BC, praising deities of the [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religions]]. Surviving from the 3rd century BC is a collection of six literary hymns ({{lang|grc|Ὕμνοι}}) by the [[Alexandria]]n poet [[Callimachus]].

[[Church Fathers|Patristic]] writers began applying the term {{lang|grc|ὕμνος}}, or ''hymnus'' in [[Latin]], to [[Christian]] songs of praise, and frequently used the word as a synonym for "[[Psalms|psalm]]".&lt;ref&gt;Entry on {{lang|grc|ὕμνος}}, Liddell and Scott, ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 8th edition 1897, 1985 printing), p. 1849; entry on 'hymnus,' Lewis and Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1879, 1987 printing), p. 872.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christian hymnody ==
Originally modeled on the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] and other poetic passages (commonly referred to as "[[canticle]]s") in the Scriptures, Christian hymns are generally directed as praise to the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]]. Many refer to [[Jesus Christ]] either directly or indirectly.

Since the earliest times, Christians have sung "psalms and hymns and spiritual songs", both in private devotions and in corporate worship ({{bibleverse||Matthew|26:30|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse|Mark|14:26|esv}}; {{bibleverse|Acts|16:25|esv}}; {{bibleverse|1|Cor|14:26|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Ephesians|5:19|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Colossians|3:16|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||James|5:13|nrsv}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Revelation|5:8–10|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Revelation|14:1–5|nrsv}}).

Non-scriptural hymns (i.e. not psalms or canticles) from the Early Church still sung today include '[[Phos Hilaron]]', '[[Sub tuum praesidium]]', and '[[Te Deum]]'.

One definition of a hymn is "...a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the worshipper's attitude toward God or God's purposes in human life. It should be simple and metrical in form, genuinely emotional, poetic and literary in style, spiritual in quality, and in its ideas so direct and so immediately apparent as to unify a congregation while singing it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian hymns are often written with special or seasonal themes and these are used on holy days such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and the Feast of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]], or during particular seasons such as [[Advent]] and [[Lent]]. Others are used to encourage reverence for the [[Bible]] or to celebrate Christian practices such as the [[eucharist]] or [[baptism]]. Some hymns praise or address individual [[saints]], particularly the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]; such hymns are particularly prevalent in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and to some extent [[High Church]] [[Anglicanism]].

A writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist, and the practice of singing hymns is called ''hymnody''; the same word is used for the collectivity of hymns belonging to a particular denomination or period (e.g. "nineteenth century Methodist hymnody" would mean the body of hymns written and/or used by Methodists in the 19th century). A collection of hymns is called a ''[[hymnal]]'' or ''hymnary''. These may or may not include music. A student of hymnody is called a ''hymnologist'', and the scholarly study of hymns, hymnists and hymnody is [[hymnology]]. The music to which a hymn may be sung is a [[hymn tune]].

In many Evangelical churches, traditional songs are classified as hymns while more contemporary worship songs are not considered hymns. The reason for this distinction is unclear, but according to some it is due to the radical shift of style and devotional thinking that began with the [[Jesus movement]] and [[Jesus music]]. Of note, in recent years, Christian traditional hymns ''have'' seen a revival in some churches, usually more Reformed or [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] in nature, as modern hymn writers such as [[Keith Getty|Keith and Kristyn Getty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-praise-of-hymns/|title=In praise of hymns|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sovereign Grace Churches|Sovereign Grace]] Music have reset old lyrics to new melodies, revised old hymns and republished them, or simply written a song in accordance with Christian hymn standards &lt;sup&gt;[according to whom?]&lt;/sup&gt; such as the hymn, ''[[In Christ Alone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Songs of faith|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/songs-of-faith/|language=en|accessdate=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music and accompaniment ===
In ancient and medieval times, [[string instrument]]s such as the [[harp]], [[lyre]] and [[lute]] were used with psalms and hymns.

Since there is a lack of [[musical notation]] in early writings,&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Hymn: 4. Hymn Sources and Transmission," Warren Anderson, et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/ Grove Music Online] (2007–2009) (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; the actual musical forms in the early church can only be surmised. During the Middle Ages a rich hymnody developed in the form of [[Gregorian chant]] or plainsong. This type was sung in unison, in one of eight [[church modes]], and most often by monastic choirs. While they were written originally in [[Latin]], many have been translated; a familiar example is the 4th century ''[[Of the Father's Heart Begotten]]'' sung to the 11th century plainsong ''Divinum Mysterium''.

==== Western church ====
[[File:St Paul's Cathedral South Organ, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Hymns are often accompanied by [[pipe organ|organ]] music]]
Later hymnody in the [[Western church]] introduced four-part vocal [[harmony]] as the norm, adopting major and minor keys, and came to be led by [[organ (music)|organ]] and choir. It shares many elements with [[European classical music|classical music]].

Today, except for choirs, more musically inclined congregations and ''[[a cappella]]'' congregations, hymns are typically sung in unison. In some cases complementary full settings for organ are also published, in others organists and other accompanists are expected to transcribe the four-part vocal score for their instrument of choice.

To illustrate [[Protestant]] usage, in the traditional services and liturgies of the [[Methodist]] churches, which are based upon [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] practice, hymns are sung (often accompanied by an organ) during the [[processional hymn|processional]] to the altar, during the receiving of communion, during the [[recessional hymn|recessional]], and sometimes at other points during the service. These hymns can be found in a common book such as the [[United Methodist Hymnal]]. The [[Doxology]] is also sung after the tithes and offerings are brought up to the altar.

[[Contemporary worship|Contemporary Christian worship]], as often found in [[Evangelicalism]] and [[Pentecostalism]], may include the use of [[contemporary worship music]] played with [[electric guitar]]s and the [[drum kit]], sharing many elements with [[rock music]].

Other groups of Christians have historically excluded instrumental accompaniment, citing the absence of instruments in worship by the church in the first several centuries of its existence, and adhere to an unaccompanied ''[[a cappella]]'' congregational singing of hymns. These groups include the 'Brethren' (often both 'Open' and 'Exclusive'), the [[Churches of Christ]], [[Mennonites]], [[Primitive Baptists]], and certain Reformed churches, although during the last century or so, several of these, such as the [[Free Church of Scotland (since 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] have abandoned this stance.

====Eastern church====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
[[Eastern Christianity]] (the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] churches) has a variety of ancient hymnographical traditions.

[[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] chant is almost always [[a cappella]], and instrumental accompaniment is rare. It is used to chant all forms of liturgical worship.

Instruments are common in Oriental traditions. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] tradition which makes use of the [[cymbal]]s and the [[Triangle (musical instrument)]]. The [[Indian Orthodox]] (Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church) use of the [[organ (music)|organ]]. The [[Tewahedo Church]]es use [[drum]]s, [[cymbal]]s and other instruments on certain occasions.

=== Development of Christian hymnody ===
[[Thomas Aquinas]], in the introduction to his commentary on the Psalms, defined the Christian hymn thus: "''Hymnus est laus Dei cum cantico; canticum autem exultatio mentis de aeternis habita, prorumpens in vocem''." ("A hymn is the praise of God with song; a song is the exultation of the mind dwelling on eternal things, bursting forth in the voice.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protestant Reformation]] resulted in two conflicting attitudes towards hymns. One approach, the [[regulative principle of worship]], favoured by many Zwinglians, Calvinists and some radical reformers, considered anything that was not directly authorised by the Bible to be a novel and Catholic introduction to worship, which was to be rejected. All hymns that were not direct quotations from the Bible fell into this category. Such hymns were banned, along with any form of instrumental musical accompaniment, and organs were removed from churches. Instead of hymns, biblical psalms were chanted, most often without accompaniment, to very basic melodies. This was known as [[exclusive psalmody]]. Examples of this may still be found in various places, including in some of the [[Scottish Presbyterian|Presbyterian churches of western Scotland]].

 | title="Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott"
 | description=Luther's paraphrase of [[Psalm 46]] is a popular [[Lutheran hymn]]
}}
The other Reformation approach, the [[normative principle of worship]], produced a burst of hymn writing and congregational singing. [[Martin Luther]] is notable not only as a reformer, but as the [[List of hymns by Martin Luther|author of many hymns]] including "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott" ("[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]"), which is sung today even by Catholics, and "[[Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ]]" ("Praise be to You, Jesus Christ") for Christmas. Luther and his followers often used their hymns, or chorales, to teach tenets of the faith to worshipers. The first Protestant hymnal was published in Bohemia in 1532 by the [[Unitas Fratrum]]. Count [[Zinzendorf]], the Lutheran leader of the [[Moravian Church]] in the 18th century wrote some 2,000 hymns. The earlier English writers tended to paraphrase biblical texts, particularly [[Psalm]]s; [[Isaac Watts]] followed this tradition, but is also credited as having written the first English hymn which was not a direct paraphrase of Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Watts (1674–1748), whose father was an Elder of a dissenter congregation, complained at age 16, that when allowed only psalms to sing, the faithful could not even sing about their Lord, Christ Jesus. His father invited him to see what he could do about it; the result was Watts' first hymn, "Behold the glories of the Lamb".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Relying heavily on Scripture, Watts wrote metered texts based on New Testament passages that brought the Christian faith into the songs of the church. Isaac Watts has been called "the father of English hymnody", but Erik Routley sees him more as "the liberator of English hymnody", because his hymns, and hymns like them, moved worshipers beyond singing only Old Testament psalms, inspiring congregations and revitalizing worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later writers took even more freedom, some even including [[allegory]] and [[metaphor]] in their texts.

[[Charles Wesley]]'s hymns spread Methodist [[theology]], not only within Methodism, but in most Protestant churches. He developed a new focus: expressing one's personal feelings in the relationship with God as well as the simple worship seen in older hymns. Wesley wrote:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Where shall my wondering soul begin?
How shall I all to heaven aspire?
A slave redeemed from death and sin,
A brand plucked from eternal fire,
How shall I equal triumphs raise,
Or sing my great deliverer's praise.
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Wesley's contribution, along with the [[Second Great Awakening]] in [[United States|America]] led to a new style called [[Gospel music|gospel]], and a new explosion of sacred music writing with [[Fanny Crosby]], [[Lina Sandell]], [[Philip Bliss]], [[Ira D. Sankey]], and others who produced testimonial music for revivals, camp meetings, and evangelistic crusades. The tune style or form is technically designated "gospel songs" as distinct from hymns. Gospel songs generally include a refrain (or chorus) and usually (though not always) a faster tempo than the hymns. As examples of the distinction, "[[Amazing Grace]]" is a hymn (no refrain), but "[[How Great Thou Art (hymn)|How Great Thou Art]]" is a gospel song. During the 19th century, the gospel-song genre spread rapidly in Protestantism and to a lesser but still definite extent, in Roman Catholicism; the gospel-song genre is unknown in the worship ''per se'' by Eastern Orthodox churches, which rely exclusively on traditional chants (a type of hymn).

The [[Methodist Revival]] of the 18th century created an explosion of hymn-writing in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], which continued into the first half of the 19th century. The most prominent names among Welsh hymn-writers are [[William Williams Pantycelyn]] and [[Ann Griffiths]]. The second half of the 19th century witnessed an explosion of hymn tune composition and congregational four-part singing in [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Wyn James, 'The Evolution of the Welsh Hymn', in ''Dissenting Praise'', ed. I. Rivers &amp; D. L. Wykes (OUP, 2011); E. Wyn James, ‘German Chorales and American Songs and Solos: Contrasting Chapters in Welsh Congregational Hymn-Singing’, ''The Bulletin of the Hymn Society of Great Britain and Ireland'', No. 295, Vol. 22:2 (Spring 2018), 43–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the more classical sacred music of composers ranging from [[Mozart]] to [[Monteverdi]], the [[Catholic Church]] continued to produce many popular hymns such as [[Lead, Kindly Light]], [[Silent Night]], O Sacrament Divine and Faith of our Fathers.

Many churches today use contemporary worship music which includes a range of styles often influenced by [[popular music]]. This often leads to some conflict between older and younger congregants (see [[contemporary worship]]). This is not new; the Christian [[Contemporary Christian Music|pop music]] style began in the late 1960s and became very popular during the 1970s, as young hymnists sought ways in which to make the music of their religion relevant for their generation.

This long tradition has resulted in a wide variety of hymns. Some modern churches include within hymnody the traditional hymn (usually describing God), contemporary worship music (often directed to God) and [[gospel music]] (expressions of one's personal experience of God). This distinction is not perfectly clear; and purists remove the second two types from the classification as hymns. It is a matter of debate, even sometimes within a single congregation, often between revivalist and traditionalist movements.

====American developments====
[[African-American]]s developed a rich hymnody from [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s during times of slavery to the modern, lively black gospel style. The first influences of African American Culture into hymns came from Slave Songs of the United States a collection of slave hymns compiled by William Francis Allen who had difficulty pinning them down from the oral tradition, and though he succeeded, he points out the awe inspiring effect of the hymns when sung in by their originators.&lt;ref&gt;Music, David. Hymnology A Collection of Source Readings. 1. 1. Lanham MD: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1996. 179/185-186/192/199/206. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hymn writing, composition, performance and the publishing of Christian hymnals were prolific in the 19th-century and were often linked to the abolitionist movement by many hymn writers. Surprisingly, [[Stephen Foster]] wrote a number of hymns that were used during church services during this era of publishing.&lt;!-- references forthcoming --&gt;

Thomas Symmes{{clarify|date=January 2011}} spread throughout churches a new idea of how to sing hymns, in which anyone could sing a hymn any way they felt led to; this idea was opposed by the views of Symmes' colleagues{{who|date=January 2011}} who felt it was "like Five Hundred different Tunes roared out at the same time".{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[William Billings]], a [[singing school]] teacher, created the first tune book with only American born compositions. Within his books, Billings did not put as much emphasis on "[[common measure]]"{{clarify|date=January 2011}} which was the typical way hymns were sung, but he attempted "to have a Sufficiency in each measure"{{clarify|date=January 2011}}. Boston's [[Handel and Haydn Society]] aimed at raising the level of church music in America, publishing their "Collection of Church Music".{{when|date=January 2011}} In the late 19th century [[Ira D. Sankey]] and [[Dwight L. Moody]] developed the relatively new subcategory of [[gospel hymn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Music, David. ''Hymnology A Collection of Source Readings''. 1. 1. Lanham MD: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in the 19th century, the use of musical notation, especially [[Shape note|shape notes]], exploded in America, and professional singing masters went from town to town teaching the population how to [[Sight-reading|sing from sight]], instead of the more common [[lining out]] that had been used before that. During this period hundreds of tune books were published, including [[Benjamin Franklin White|B.F. White's]] ''[[Sacred Harp]]'', and earlier works like the [[The Missouri Harmony|''Missouri Harmony'']], ''[[Kentucky Harmony]]'', [[The Hesperian Harp|''Hesperian Harp'']], D.H. Mansfield's ''The American Vocalist'', ''The Social Harp'', the ''[[Southern Harmony]]'', [[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]]'s ''[[The Christian Harmony|Christian Harmony]]'', [[Jeremiah Ingalls]]' ''Christian Harmony'', and literally many dozens of others. Shape notes were important in the spread of (then) more modern singing styles, with tenor-led 4-part harmony (based on older English [[West gallery music|West Gallery music]]), [[Fuguing tune|fuging]] sections, [[Anthem|anthems]] and other more complex features. During this period, hymns were incredibly popular in the United States, and one or more of the above-mentioned tunebooks could be found in almost every household. It isn't uncommon to hear accounts of young people and teenagers gathering together to spend an afternoon singing hymns and anthems from tune books, which was considered great fun, and there are surviving accounts of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his sweetheart singing together from the ''Missouri Harmony'' during his youth. 

By the 1860s musical reformers like [[Lowell Mason]] (the so-called "better music boys") were actively campaigning for the introduction of more "refined" and modern singing styles, and eventually these American tune books were replaced in many churches, starting in the Northeast and urban areas, and spreading out into the countryside as people adopted the gentler, more soothing tones of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] hymnody, and even adopted dedicated, trained [[Choir|choirs]] to do their church's singing, rather than having the entire congregation participate. But in many rural areas the old traditions lived on, not in churches, but in weekly, monthly or annual conventions were people would meet to sing from their favorite tunebooks. The most popular one, and the only one that survived continuously in print, was the ''[[Sacred Harp]]'', which could be found in the typical rural Southern home right up until the living tradition was "re-discovered" by [[Alan Lomax]] in the 1960s (although it had been well-documented by [[Musicology|musicologist]] [[George Pullen Jackson]] prior to this). Indeed, "the most common book on . Since then there has been a renaissance in "Sacred Harp singing", with annual conventions popping up in [[United States|all 50 states]] and in a number of European countries recently, including the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]] and [[Poland]], as well as in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredharpbremen.org/|title=Sacred Harp Bremen|website=www.sacredharpbremen.org|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukshapenote.org.uk/|title=Welcome|last=Macadam|first=Edwin and Sheila|website=www.ukshapenote.org.uk|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sacredharp86.org/|title=Sacred Harp in Poland {{!}} Polish Sacred Harp Community Website|website=sacredharp86.org|language=pl-PL|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://sacredharpaustralia.com/] Today "Sacred Harp singing" is a vibrant and living tradition with thousands of enthusiastic participants all around the globe, drawn to the democratic principles of the tradition and exotic, beautiful sound of the music.

===Hymn meters===
{{main|Meter (hymn)}}
The meter indicates the number of syllables for the lines in each [[stanza]] of a hymn. This provides a means of marrying the hymn's text with an appropriate [[hymn tune]] for singing. In practice many hymns conform to one of a relatively small number of meters (syllable count and stress patterns). Care must be taken, however, to ensure that not only the metre of words and tune match, but also the stresses on the words in each line. Technically speaking an iambic tune, for instance, cannot be used with words of, say, trochaic metre.

The meter is often denoted by a row of figures besides the name of the tune, such as "87.87.87", which would inform the reader that each verse has six lines, and that the first line has eight syllables, the second has seven, the third line eight, etc. The meter can also be described by initials; L.M. indicates long meter, which is 88.88 (four lines, each eight syllables long); S.M. is short meter (66.86); C.M. is common metre (86.86), while D.L.M., D.S.M. and D.C.M. (the "D" stands for double) are similar to their respective single meters except that they have eight lines in a verse instead of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Also, if the number of syllables in one verse differ from another verse in the same hymn (e.g., the hymn "I Sing a Song of the Saints of God"), the meter is called Irregular.

The '''''Ibálong''''', also known as '''''Handiong''''' or '''''Handyong''''', is a 60-stanza fragment of a Bikol full-length [[ethnopoetics|folk]] epic of [[Bicol Region|Bikol region]] of [[Philippines]], based on the Indian [[Hindu]] epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharta]]. The epic is said to have been narrated in verse form by a native poet called '''Kadunung'''. 
It was passed on orally until it was presumably jotted down in its complete Bikol narrative by [[:bcl:Fray Bernardino Melendreras|Fray Bernardino de Melendreras de la Trinidad]]. The Ibalong portrays deeds in heroic proportions, centering on white men or ''tawong-lipod'' who were warrior-heroes named, among others, ''Baltog'', ''Handyong'', and ''Bantong''. They came from [[India|Boltavara]], settling and ruling ''Bikolandia'' and its inhabitants. The epic is set in the land of Aslon and Ibalong. The mountains [[Mount Iriga|Asog]], [[Mount Masaraga|Masaraga]], [[Mount Isarog|Isarog]], and Lingyon were prominent features of the area.&lt;ref name=Agui1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aguilar|first1=[edited by] Celedonio G.|title=Readings in Philippine literature|date=1994|publisher=Rex Book Store|location=Manila|isbn=9712315649|page=51|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=us1hhS5Q6EYC&amp;pg=PA51|access-date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In its oldest known text, the folk epic does not have a title. The oldest existing account of it is written in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

A non-religious festival, the [[Ibalong Festival]] is celebrated annually in honor of the epic ''Ibalong'' as a celebration of the geography of Ibalon. It is unusual because [[Spaniards]] introduced saints and fiestas and all religious-related activities except Ibalong. It is also a celebration of the province’s people and their resiliency, given the string calamities that regularly befall the region given its typhoon-prone geographical location.

==History==
The full-length narrative is presumably jotted down by [[:bcl:Fray Bernardino Melendreras|Fray Bernardino de Melendreras de la Trinidad]] (1815-1867),&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt; a [[Franciscan]] missionary in [[Guinobatan, Albay]], when he got acquainted with an errant [[:tl:Mga Bikolano|Bikolano]] bard referred to in the epic as Kadunung. It was put afterward into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] by Melendreras in Ibal, a 400-age manuscript in verse on the ancient customs of the Indios of [[Albay]].

The sixty-stanza portion was later included in a treatise on the [[Bicol Region|Bikol region]] by [[Jose Castaño|Fray Jose Castaño]] in 1895. However, no credit was given to Melendreras by Castaño in the work, and so students of the Ibalong have since presumed that it was recorded and translated by Castaño himself.

The full English translation of the Ibalong was first published in the [[Far Eastern University]] Faculty Journal, [[Manila]] by [[:bcl:Merito Espinas|Merito B. Espinas]].&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

==Summary of the Ibálong in English prose==
The epic opens with ''Iling'' requesting the bard Kadunung to recount the tale of the glorious Ibálong of long ago. Forthwith Kadunung described the ancient land and spoke of its first hero, ''Baltog'', a White [[Aryan]], who had come from [[India|Boltavara]] (Bharata-varsha or India). He planted a linsa patch in ''Tondol'' (now in Kamalig) which, one night, was foraged by a giant [[wild boar]] (Tandayag). The furious Baltog chased the Tandayag, killed it with his bare hands, and hung its enormous jawbones on a [[Terminalia catappa|talisay]] tree in front of his house in Tondol. For this marvelous feat, he was acknowledged chief of the local hunters. The clans of Panicuason and Asog came over to marvel at the monstrous wild boar in Ibálong.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ibalon: Tatlong Bayani ng Epikong Bicol|last = Lacson|first = Tomas|publisher = Children's Communication Center: Aklat Adarna|year = 1992|isbn = |location = Philippines|pages = |last2 = Gamos|first2 = Albert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next to come was Handyong. With his followers, he fought the monsters of the land. But ''Oryol'', a wily serpent who appeared as a beautiful maiden with a seductive voice, was one whom Handyong could not destroy. Meanwhile, Oryol admired Handyong's bravery and gallantry. Because of this, Oryol helped Handyong clear the region of ferocious beasts until peace came to the whole of the land.

With Ibálong rid of wild creatures, Handyong turned to making wise laws and planting the land to linsa and rice. A period of the invention followed: boat, farming tools, weaving looms, claywares, kitchen utensils, tree houses, and even a syllabary. Together, the people built a society with culture. It was a golden period in Ibálong when even slaves were respected under the laws of Handyong.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Then came a great flood, freed by ''Unos'',&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; that changed the features of the land. Three volcanoes, named Hantik, Kulasi, and Isarog erupted simultaneously. Inundations caused lands to sink, from which Lake Buhi came about, or rise, as in the strip of seacoast in Pasacao, Camarines Sur, and wiped out many settlements, especially the Dagatnong settlement in the Kalabangan Gulf.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Malbogong Islet formed in the Bikol River. The Inarihan River altered its course. A lofty mountain sank at Bato, forming a lake.

Despite the calamities, Ibálong grew powerful under Old Chief Handyong, whose constant companion and good friend, by then, was the young Bantong. Although given a thousand men to destroy the half man and half beast Rabot, who could change its enemies into rocks, Bantong slew it single-handedly – to the loud cheers of his thousand warriors that reverberated throughout the forests and mangroves swamps. Brought to Ligmanan, the corpse of Rabot was horrible to behold. The Great Handyong himself was shocked at the sight.

At this point, the Ibálong epic-fragment ends abruptly, and Kadunung promises to continue the story some other time.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Curious ending of the Ibálong==
The fragmentary epic ended at that part where Bantong killed the fierce half-man and beast, Rabot. Curiously, Handyong was saddened by Rabot's death. In her study of the Ibalong Epic, the Bikol scholar, Ma. Lilia F. Realubit, explained that the reason behind this is that Handyong might have "mourned the passing of an era, when men were proved men by monsters and the skill of the hunt, when magic and ceremonial incantations infused life and explained his questions about life and nature and the supernatural."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She also added that Handyong could have “correctly foresaw the coming of a new age and aptly mourned the death of his time.” Meanwhile, some others speculate that he foresaw the subjugation and destitution of his people under a less benevolent leader - as what, indeed, happened under the Spanish colonial rule.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Ibalon to Sorsogon|last = Dery|first = Luis|publisher = New Day Publishers|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Quezon City|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallelism with Spanish rule==
The existence of various Bikol oral accounts focus on a curse allegedly cast against the Bikol people seem to bridge the gap between the Ibalong epic and the subsequent decline and destitution of the Bikolanos. Some of these oral accounts indicated such a transformation. In Sorsogon, the legend of San Bernardino embodied this turn of events against the land and its inhabitants. The legend spoke about a mighty spirit who dwelt in [[Mount Bulusan|Mt. Bulusan]] and fell in love with a maiden there. This maiden did not love him back, and so the spirit was enraged. Panic filled everyone except one man - the favored suitor of the maiden. He killed the spirit to stop its violence in the area. Once killed, the spirit fell into the sea. The part of the water in which the spirit fell transformed into land. The old folks claim that the two islands with a slender strip of water between [[Samar]] and [[Sorsogon]] were the spirit of [[Mount Bulusan|Mt. Bulusan]]. It is now called the Strait of San Bernardino and is considered enchanted or ''engkantado.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The parallelism of the events in the Ibálong and the above-cited legend with what actually happened under Spanish rule seems to suggest the total transformation of the inhabitants from a sturdy phase to becoming passive people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Setting==
There is no definite date that can be given to where the epic-fragment starts and ends, however, what little is known about the legendary beginnings of Bikol might describe the area circa 4, 500 years ago. The epic-fragment portrays ancient Bikol as lush in jungle growth, teeming with fish and wild game, and dotted by mountain ranges, hills, and volcanoes.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt; The bard '''Kadunung''' in the epic recounted this as the glorious ''Bikolandia'', a beautiful and fertile ancient land of long ago, inhabited by strong and brave people, that existed before a catastrophe destroyed it some 4,500 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Significance==
The Ibálong is an invaluable piece of literature that marks the spontaneous record of the ancient Bikol's early struggle for principle, survival, and growth. It commemorates the [[Bicolano people]]'s resilience against the typhoons that annually beset their region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Minahan|first1=James B.|title=Ethnic groups of South Asia and the Pacific an encyclopedia|date=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1598846604|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=fOQkpcVcd9AC&amp;pg=PT66|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stresses the humble accomplishments and peaceful pursuits of the early Bikolanos, including the implementation of just laws. Among other pursuits is the cultivation of upland and lowland crops, the construction of dwellings on tall trees, the creation of the first boat in the region, the making of utensils, tools, and wares, but most importantly, the invention of writing. The epic depicts the transition of the ancient Bikolanos from the hunting stage to the agricultural stage, from the nomadic state to the settled life.

The Ibalong teaches about courage, of how a simple act can bring about positive change. The heroes made use of this courage to lead the community out of chaos without any regard for self-glorification. This gives evidence of good leadership.  However, it must also be noted that all three heroes were foreigners and not pure inhabitants of the Ibalong. This poses an argument that the locals had to depend on foreign abilities and leadership before they were able to obtain progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ejournals.ph/index.php?journal=DALUMAT&amp;page=article&amp;op=view&amp;path%5B%5D=506&amp;path%5B%5D=539|title = Ethical and Political Philosophy in the Ibalon Epic|date = 2010|accessdate = December 7, 2015|website = Dalumat E-Journal|publisher = |last = de Leon|first = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also portrayed in the epic is the concept of social class, of slaves and masters. However, this did not hinder the growth of the community because the classes respected each other.

The Ibalong stresses the humble accomplishments and peaceful pursuits of the early Bikolanos. It is unlikely that the ancient Bikolanos had worshiped idols. Nothing is mentioned about gods in the epic except perhaps in passing, ''Onos'', the god of floodwaters.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

The very survival of these pre-Hispanic legends is direct proof of the vitality of Bikol culture. Folk history or not, this epic is valuable for it enabled the Bikolanos of today to gain valuable insights into the misty past of their land and their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Bikol Blend|last = Owen|first = Norman|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The epic is celebrated through street performances and floats on Ibalong Festival in [[Legazpi,_Albay|Legazpi]] City, Bicol region since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Calleja|first1=Danny O.|title=Ibalong Festival street presentation to relive Bicolandia's mythical heroes|url=http://balita.ph/2013/08/31/ibalong-festival-street-presentation-to-relive-bicolandias-mythical-heroes/|accessdate=10 February 2015|publisher=Balita.ph|date=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is celebrated in Legazpi City during the month of August. The Ibalong festival features the various characters from the epic while celebrating through song and dance. It is also performed in theaters like [[Tanghalang Pilipino]]'s ''Ibalong the Musical'' by Rody Vera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Santiago|first1=Katrina Stuart|title=Theater review: 'Ibalong''s imagination|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/298854/lifestyle/reviews/theater-review-ibalong-s-imagination|accessdate=10 February 2015|publisher=GMA News Online|date=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obstacles that the Ancient Bikols encountered==
#The obstacle of the giant wild boar that foraged Baltog's linsa crop: Even as Baltog slew this wild boar in a celebrated combat episode in the epic, this still could have awakened his potential for the hunt, inducing him into becoming a part-time hunter himself.
#The second obstacle was Oryol, who tried to keep Handyong from ridding the land of ferocious wild beasts.
#The third obstacle took the form of natural catastrophes: the sweeping deluge, the violent and simultaneous eruption of three volcanoes, etc.
#The fourth obstacle was the half-man and half-beast Rabot who led a lot, and by whose magic turned to stone all those who fought him.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

==Protagonists==
Many accomplishments and advances made by the ancient Bikols were credited to various characters mentioned in the epic.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Baltog''': Baltog was the first white man or ''tawong-lipod'' to come to Bikol. Born in [[India]] (although India is called "Boltavara" in the epic) to the brave clan of Lipod, he introduced agriculture to Bikol by planting ''linsa'' or ''apay'', which was a characteristic of early Indian colonizers. He slew the Tandayag Boar in a bone-wracking combat.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Bantong''': Bantong was a brave and cunning young warrior who single-handedly killed the half-man and half-wild beast Rabot, although Handyong had given him 1,000 warriors to help him do it.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Dinahong''': Dinahong, meaning "wrapped with leaves", is the original Bikolano potter who was believed to have been an [[Aeta people|Agta]] (Negrito) or pygmy. He helped the people learn cooking, making pots called ''coron'', stoves, earthen jars, and other kitchen utensils.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Ginantong''': Ginantong made the plow, harrow, and other farming tools.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Hablom''': Hablom, from the verb ''hablon'' meaning “to weave”, was the inventor of the first weaving loom and bobbins in the Bikol region, especially for weaving [[Abacá|abaca]] clothes.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Handyong''': The central figure in the epic is Handyong. He came to [[Bicol Region|Bikol]] with his followers after Baltog, and came to be the most famous of the tawong-lipod. He cleared the land of predatory monsters, inspired inventions, reintroduced agriculture, built tree-houses where ''anitos'' or idols were kept called ''moog'', and set up a code of laws, establishing a golden age in his day.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt; He is also known to have built the first boat and developed rice cultivation in flooded areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Philippine National Historical Society|title=The Journal of History, Volumes 36-37|date=1998|publisher=University of Michigan|page=94|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=fDpwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ibalong|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kimantong''': Kimantong is attributed to have been the first Bikolano to fashion the rudder called ''timon'', the sail called ''layag'', the plow called ''arado'', the harrow called ''surod'', the ''ganta'' and other measures, the roller, the yoke, the ''bolo'', and the hoe. A baranggay called Kimantong is found in [[Daraga, Albay]].&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Sural''': Sural, or ''surat'', meaning “to write” or “letter” was the first Bikolano to have thought of a syllabary. He carved it on a white rock-slab from Libong, which Gapon later polished.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Takay''': Takay was a lovely maiden who, according to legend, drowned during the great flood in the epic. He is believed to have become the water hyacinth in what is now Lake Bato.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

==Beasts==

'''Wild Carabaos''': [[water buffalo|Wild carabaos]] were not yet domesticated for farm work back then. They freely roamed the mountains in the early days. Handyong was able to domesticate the big-bodied beasts "in a short while".&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Giant Crocodile''': Also called [[Philippine crocodile|buaya]], Handyong defeated the giant crocodiles in combat. Handyong was assisted by Oryol in killing many of them, which lead tinged the Bikol River red with blood. The survivors were banished, along with Sarimao, to Mount Kulasi.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

==Monsters==
Long before Spaniards arrived in Bikol and introduced Christianity, the Bikolanos already believed in gods and supernatural beings. The epic-fragment contains many of the supernatural faith and religion that the ancient Bikols had. Among them are supernatural creatures.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Angongolood''': The Angongolood lurked along shadowy riversides. They were hideous apes that transformed their victims into trees surprising them in a tight embrace.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Buring''': The Buring was a one-eyed, three-throated creature which inhabited the swampy wastes of Ponong.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Rabot''': Rabot was a ferocious half-human half-monster that could turn people into the rock by magic. Rabot is ugly, a liar, and had a loud voice. Bantong slew the monster using his [[Bolo knife|bolo]].&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Sarimao''': The Sarimao were avenging monsters that were brutally fierce, ugly, and ruinous. They went after evildoers, usually to those with hidden guilt, who could not be brought to justice. Handyong exiled the Sarimao to Mount Kulasi. Their human equivalents are believed to be those who take the law into their own hands, who have suffered injustice.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Serpents''': The serpents were probably related to Oryol, a serpent with a beautiful voice and could change its image to deceive enemies. Handyong sealed all the serpents inside a huge cave in Mount Hantik.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Tandayag Boar''': The word tandayag means “giant”, meaning that it could be any living being that had grown very old and enormous. In the epic, Tandayag was the boar slew by Baltog.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Tiburon''': The Tiburon were giant flying fishes which had slimy, scaly, and hardy flesh and saw-like teeth that could crush rocks. Handiong and his men did not stop until they vanquished every Tiburon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Winged sharks''': The winged sharks mentioned were not really winged sharks but rather [[manta ray]]s that would sometimes pop out of the water like flying bats. These monsters were soon restrained by Handyong to keep waters safe for his followers.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Moog''': Moogs are treehouses where the ancient Bikols' lived and kept ''anitos'' and idols.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Dagatnong settlement''': In the epic, the Dagatnong settlement was said to have been swept away by the Great Flood. The Dagatnong were the black [[Pygmy peoples|pygmies]] who swelt on seacoasts, opposite of the [[Aeta people|Agta]] who lived in the highlands. The dagatnong originally came from Kotmong.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

==Volcanoes in Ibalong==

'''Aslong''': Meaning "faintly visible", was famous for its tales of sweet enchantment in the glorious days of long ago. Presently, almost nothing is left of it but a few ridges around a shallowing crater.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Asog''': Meaning "with only one testicle", it refers to the effeminate black priests of Aswang's devil-cult that had its center in the wilds of this volcano during Bikol's epic age. It may also refer to a priest dressed like a woman. Asog is now called Mount Iriga.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Hantik''': A big species of ants, the hantiks, gave Hantik its name. The ants are believed to have inhabited this mountain's Kalupnitan Caves, where Handyong drove and buried alive the wily, sweet-voiced serpents that masqueraded as lovely maidens.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Isarog''': From the word ''isaro'' meaning "put together", Isarog was the rugged volcano where the angonglood of the [[Bicol River|Bikol River]] forests fled to escape the wrath of Handyong.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Masaraga''': Masaraga is believed to have been where the Sarimao had their cave. The name comes from the intensifier ''ma'' and ''saga'', meaning "a brilliant flame" or "glaring".&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

==Difference from other Philippine epics==
The differences of the Ibalong from other Philippine epics may suggest culture differences of the Ancient Bikols from other ancient groups.
#The Ibalong suggests moral wholesomeness. There is no violence against another human being. The struggle of the ancient Bikolano's were primarily between people and the forces of nature. Sex was not played up in the Ibalong, unlike the usual run of many folk epics. 
#The epic stresses humble accomplishments and peaceful pursuits of the early Bikolano's: the cultivation of upland and lowland crops, the construction of dwellings on treetops, the hollowing-out of a tree trunk to make the first boat in the region, the crafting of tools, utensils, wares, the implementation of just laws, and the invention of writing.
#The Ibalong is close to authenticity. The Ibalong contains [[Bikol languages|Bikol]] names of old places and landmarks that still exist.
#The Ibalong suggests the working harmony of opposites. An example of this is the conflict between Oryol and Handyong, who ended up helping each other rid the land of predatory monsters.&lt;ref name=Agui1/&gt;

'''Idumban''' @Kudumban is a great devotee of Lord [[Kartikeya|Muruga]] and a greatest disciple of sage [[Agastya]] according to Hindu mythology.  Idumban is also seen as one of  the guardian of Muruga's temples in [[Tamil Nadu]]. During [[Thaipusam|ThaiPoosam]] celebrations in the Tamil month of Thai (January), Tamil people observes a ritual practice of [[Kavadi Attam|kavadiyaatam]] to obtain blessings from God Muruga.In this ritual practise before entering into muruga shrine people used to worship Idumban.

==Mythology==
Sage [[Agastya]] wanted to take two hills - Sivagiri and Sakthigiri - to his abode in the South and commissioned his disciple Idumban to carry them. Idumban bore the hills slung across his shoulders, in the form of a kavadi one on either side. When he was fatigued, he placed the kavadi near Palani to take rest.At this stage, Subrahmanya or Muruga had been outwitted in a contest for going round the world. [[Ganesha|Ganapati]] had won the prized fruit (pomegranate or mango) by simply going round His parents. Long after, this, Subrahmanya came sweating on His peacock to find that the prize had already been given away. In anger, the frustrated child left the divine parents and came down to [[Palani Murugan temple|TiruAvinankudi]] at the Adivaram (pronounced Adivaram. It means foot of the Sivagiri Hill). Siva pacified Him by saying that He (Subrahmanya) Himself was the fruit (pazham) of all wisdom and knowledge; nee - you. Hence the place was called 'Pazham Nee' or Palani. Later, He withdrew to the hill and settled there as a recluse in peace and solitude. By seeing Idumba, God Muruga decided to test his devotion towards his master Agastya and his determination.When Idumban resumed his journey, he could not lift the hill. Muruga had made it impossible for Idumban to make it. In the fierce battle that ensued, Idumban was killed but was later on restored to life. Idumban prayed that:

1. Whosoever carried on his shoulders the Kavadi, signifying the two hills and visited the temple on a vow, should be blessed and;

2. He should be given the privilege of standing sentinel at the entrance to the hill.

Hence we have the Idumban shrine halfway up the hill where every pilgrim is expected to offer obeisance to Idumban before entering the temple of Dandayudhapani. Since then, pilgrims to Palani bring their offerings on their shoulders in a kavadi. The custom has spread from Palani to all Muruga shrines worldwide.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

{{Isaac Newton sidebar}}

English physicist and mathematician [[Isaac Newton]] produced many works that would now be classified as [[occult]] studies. These works explored [[chronology]], [[alchemy]], and [[Biblical hermeneutics|Biblical interpretation]] (especially of the [[Apocalypse]]). Newton's scientific work may have been of lesser personal importance to him, as he placed emphasis on rediscovering the occult wisdom of the ancients. In this sense, some historians, including economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], believe that any reference to a "Newtonian Worldview" as being purely mechanical in nature is somewhat inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, J.M., 'Newton, The Man'; Proceedings of the Royal Society Newton Tercentenary Celebrations, 15–19 July 1946; Cambridge University Press (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; Historical research on Newton's occult studies in relation to his science have also been used to challenge the [[disenchantment]] narrative within [[critical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 | pages = 43 and Chapter 2, ''passim'' |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After purchasing and studying Newton's alchemical works, Keynes, for example, opined in 1942 at the [[tercentenary]] of his birth that "Newton was not the first of the [[age of reason]], he was the last of the [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]]." In the [[Early Modern Period]] of Newton's lifetime, the educated embraced a [[world view]] different from that of later centuries. Distinctions between science, [[superstition]], and [[pseudoscience]] were still being formulated, and a devoutly Christian biblical perspective permeated Western culture.

==Alchemical research==
Much of what are known as Isaac Newton's [[occult]] studies can largely be attributed to his study of [[alchemy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Newton's manuscripts provide evidence that he gave considerable thought to alchemy as emblematic of a purely scientific explanation of nature and was in fact deeply involved in conceiving alchemy as spiritual." F. Calian, "Some Modern Controversies on the Historiography of Alchemy" in ''Annual of Medieval Studies'' at CEU (2010), 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton was deeply interested in all forms of [[natural sciences]] and [[materials science]], an interest which would ultimately lead to some of his better-known contributions to science. During Newton's lifetime, the study of [[chemistry]] was still in its infancy, so many of his experimental studies used esoteric language and vague terminology more typically associated with alchemy and occultism.&lt;ref&gt;"his alchemy cannot be seen solely in connection with his chemical experiments but was also a link between his religious beliefs and his scientific aims". Karin Figala, "Newton's Alchemy," in The Cambridge Companion to Newton, ed. I. Bernard Cohen and George Edwin Smith (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 375.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until several decades after Newton's death that experiments of [[stoichiometry]] under the pioneering works of [[Antoine Lavoisier]] were conducted, and analytical chemistry, with its associated nomenclature, came to resemble modern chemistry as we know it today. However, Newton's contemporary and fellow Royal Society member, [[Robert Boyle]], had already discovered the basic concepts of modern chemistry and began establishing modern norms of experimental practice and communication in chemistry, information which Newton did not use.

Much of Newton's writing on alchemy may have been lost in a fire in his laboratory, so the true extent of his work in this area may have been larger than is currently known. Newton also suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] during his period of alchemical work, possibly due to some form of chemical poisoning (possibly from [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], lead, or some other substance).&lt;ref name="Nova" /&gt;

[[File:Isaac Newton laboratory fire.jpg|thumb|left|An 1874 engraving showing a probably apocryphal account of Newton's lab fire. In the story, [[Diamond (dog)|Newton's dog]] started the fire, burning 20 years of research. Newton is thought to have said: "O Diamond, Diamond, thou little knowest the mischief thou hast done."&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Alfred Rupert Hall, ''Isaac Newton: Eighteenth Century Perspectives'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 175. {{ISBN|0-19-850364-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Newton's writings suggest that one of the main goals of his alchemy may have been the discovery of the [[philosopher's stone]] (a material believed to turn base metals into gold), and perhaps to a lesser extent, the discovery of the highly coveted [[Elixir of Life]].&lt;ref name="Nova"&gt;{{cite video |title = Nova: Newton's Dark Secrets | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/newton/ | publisher = PBS | location = USA |year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton reportedly believed that a [[Diana's Tree]], an alchemical demonstration producing a [[Dendrite (metal)|dendritic]] "growth" of silver from solution, was evidence that metals "possessed a sort of life."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://discovermagazine.com/2010/jul-aug/05-isaac-newton-world.s-most-famous-alchemist Isaac Newton and the Philosophers' Stone]", Jane Bosveld, ''[[Discover Magazine]]'', July/August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Some practices of alchemy were banned in England during Newton's lifetime, due in part to unscrupulous practitioners who would often promise wealthy benefactors unrealistic results in an attempt to swindle them. [[English crown|The English Crown]], also fearing the potential devaluation of gold, should the philosopher's stone actually be discovered, made penalties for alchemy very severe. In some cases the punishment for unsanctioned alchemy would include the public hanging of an offender on a gilded scaffold while adorned with tinsel and other unspecified items.&lt;ref name="Nova" /&gt;

==Writings==
Due to the threat of punishment and the potential scrutiny he feared from his peers within the scientific community, Newton may have deliberately left his work on alchemical subjects unpublished. Newton was well known as being highly sensitive to criticism, such as the numerous instances when he was criticized by [[Robert Hooke]], and his admitted reluctance to publish any substantial information regarding [[calculus]] before 1693. A perfectionist by nature, Newton also refrained from publication of material that he felt was incomplete, as evident from a 38-year gap from Newton's conception of calculus in 1666 and its final full publication in 1704, which would ultimately lead to the infamous [[Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy]].

In 1936, a collection of Isaac Newton's unpublished works were auctioned by [[Sotheby's]] on behalf of [[Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth]], who had inherited them from Newton's great-niece. Known as the "Portsmouth Papers", this material consisted of three hundred and twenty-nine lots of Newton's manuscripts, over a third of which were filled with content that appeared to be alchemical in nature. At the time of Newton's death this material was considered "unfit to publish" by Newton's estate, and consequently fell into obscurity until their somewhat sensational reemergence in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the auction many of these documents, along with Newton's [[death mask]], were purchased by economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who throughout his life collected many of Newton's alchemical writings.&lt;ref name="Gleick2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|authorlink=James Gleick|title=Isaac Newton|url={{Google books|t2-KDQAAQBAJ|page=188|plainurl=yes}}|year=2004|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-1-4000-3295-2|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Keynes collection later passed to eccentric document collector [[Abraham Yahuda]], who was himself a vigorous collector of Isaac Newton's original manuscripts.

Many of the documents collected by Keynes and Yahuda are now in the [[Jewish National and University Library]] in Jerusalem.{{Citation needed|reason=Newton Project says King's College|date=December 2016}} In recent years, several projects have begun to gather, catalogue, and transcribe the fragmented collection of Newton's work on alchemical subjects and make them freely available for on-line access.

Newman, History of Science Professor, Indiana University [http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/index.jsp index]&lt;/ref&gt; supported by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]], and ''The Newton Project''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/prism.php?id=1|title=The Newton Project|publisher=University of Sussex|author=Professor Rob Iliffe}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by the U.K. [[Arts and Humanities Research Board]]. In addition, The Jewish National and University Library has published a number of high-quality scanned images of various Newton documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/mss/newton/gallery_eng.html gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214024618/http://www.jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/mss/newton/gallery_eng.html |date=14 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Philosopher's Stone ===
Of the material sold during the 1936 Sotheby's auction, several documents indicate an interest by Newton in the procurement or development of the [[philosopher's stone]]. Most notably are documents entitled ''Artephius his secret Book'', followed by ''The Epistle of Iohn Pontanus, wherein he beareth witness of ye book of Artephius''; these are themselves a collection of excerpts from another work entitled ''Nicholas Flammel, His Exposition of the Hieroglyphicall Figures which he caused to be painted upon an Arch in St Innocents Church-yard in Paris. Together with The secret Booke of Artephius, And the Epistle of Iohn Pontanus: Containing both the Theoricke and the Practicke of the Philosophers Stone''. This work may also have been referenced by Newton in its Latin version found within [[Lazarus Zetzner]]'s ''[[Theatrum Chemicum]]'', a volume often associated with the ''[[Turba Philosophorum]]'' and other early European alchemical manuscripts. [[Nicolas Flamel]], one subject of the aforementioned work, was a notable, though mysterious figure, often associated with the discovery of the philosopher's stone, hieroglyphical figures, early forms of [[tarot]], and occultism. [[Artephius]], and his "secret book", were also subjects of interest to 17th century alchemists.

Also in the 1936 auction of Newton's collection was ''The Epitome of the treasure of health written by Edwardus Generosus Anglicus innominatus who lived Anno Domini 1562''. This is a twenty-eight-page treatise on the philosopher's stone, the Animal or [[Angelicall Stone]], the Prospective stone or magical stone of Moses, and the vegetable or the growing stone.  The treatise concludes with an alchemical poem.

== Biblical studies ==
In a manuscript he wrote in 1704 in which he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible, Newton estimated that the world would end no earlier than 2060. In predicting this he said, "This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Newton's studies of the Temple of Solomon ===
[[File:Isaac Newton's Temple of Solomon.jpg|thumb|right|Isaac Newton's diagram of part of the [[Temple of Solomon]], taken from Plate 1 of [[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]] (published London, 1728)]]
Newton studied and wrote extensively upon the [[Temple of Solomon]], dedicating an entire chapter of ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'' to his observations regarding the temple. Newton's primary source for information was the description of the structure given within [[1 Kings]] of the Hebrew Bible, which he translated himself from [[hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref name="TempleInstitute"&gt;{{cite web | last =Richman | first =Rabbi Chaim |author2=Temple Institute | title =Temple Institute: Isaac Newton and the Holy Temple | publisher =Temple Institute | date =1991–2008 | url =http://www.templeinstitute.org/isaac_newton_holy_temple.htm | accessdate =1 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to scripture, Newton also relied upon various ancient and contemporary sources while studying the temple.  He believed that many ancient sources were endowed with sacred wisdom&lt;ref name="Nova" /&gt; and that the [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s of many of their temples were in themselves sacred. This belief would lead Newton to examine many architectural works of Hellenistic [[ancient Greece|Greece]], as well as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources such as [[Vitruvius]], in a search for their occult knowledge. This concept, often termed ''[[prisca sapientia]]'' (sacred wisdom and also the ancient wisdom that was revealed to Adam and Moses directly by God), was a common belief of many scholars during Newton's lifetime.&lt;ref name="Christianson"&gt;{{Cite book | last =Christianson | first =Gale E. | publicationdate =2005 | title =Isaac Newton | publisher =Oxford University Press US | page =144 | isbn =0-19-530070-X | url =https://books.google.com/?id=lwcDZ0Ex4lYC | accessdate = 4 July 2008 | date =2005 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more contemporary source for Newton's studies of the temple was [[Juan Bautista Villalpando]], who just a few decades earlier had published an influential manuscript entitled ''Ezechielem Explanationes'', in which Villalpando comments on the visions of the biblical prophet [[Ezekiel]], including within this work his own interpretations and elaborate reconstructions of Solomon's Temple. In its time, Villalpando's work on the temple produced a great deal of interest throughout Europe and had a significant impact upon later architects and scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Goldish. Page 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacDonnell"&gt;{{cite web | last =MacDonnell | first =Joseph | title =Juan Bautista Villalpando, S.J. | publisher =Fairfield University | url =http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/sj/scientists/villalpando.htm | accessdate =1 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Bible scholar, Newton was initially interested in the [[sacred geometry]] of Solomon's Temple, such as [[Golden ratio|golden sections]], [[conic section]]s, [[spirals]], [[orthographic projection]], and other harmonious constructions, but he also believed that the dimensions and proportions represented more. He noted that the temple's measurements given in the Bible are mathematical problems, related to solutions for &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and [[Sphere|the volume of a hemisphere]], &lt;math&gt;V = (2/3)\pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;, and in a larger sense that they were references to the size of the [[Earth]] and man's place and proportion to it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Newton believed that the temple was designed by [[King Solomon]] with privileged eyes and divine guidance. To Newton, the geometry of the temple represented more than a mathematical blueprint, it also provided a time-frame chronology of Hebrew history.&lt;ref name="TheShadowofSolomon"&gt;{{Cite book | last =Gardner | first =Laurence | publicationdate =2007 | date = 2007| title =The Shadow of Solomon: The Lost Secret of the Freemasons Revealed | publication-place =Originally published: London : HarperElement, 2005 | place =USA | publisher =Weiser | page =146 | isbn =1-57863-404-0 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=JTPcRXdUahQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Shadow+of+Solomon | accessdate =4 July 2008 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was for this reason that he included a chapter devoted to the temple within ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'', a section which initially may seem unrelated to the historical nature of the book as a whole.

Newton felt that just as the writings of ancient philosophers, scholars, and Biblical figures contained within them unknown sacred wisdom, the same was true of their architecture. He believed that these men had hidden their knowledge in a complex code of symbolic and mathematical language that, when deciphered, would reveal an unknown knowledge of how nature works.&lt;ref name="Christianson" /&gt;

In 1675 Newton annotated a copy of ''Manna – a disquisition of the nature of alchemy'', an anonymous treatise which had been given to him by his fellow scholar [[Ezekiel Foxcroft]]. In his annotation Newton reflected upon his reasons for examining Solomon's Temple by writing:

{{quote|This philosophy, both speculative and active, is not only to be found in the volume of nature, but also in the sacred scriptures, as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Job|Job]], Psalms, Isaiah and others. In the knowledge of this philosophy, God made Solomon the greatest philosopher in the world.&lt;ref name="TheShadowofSolomon" /&gt;}}

During Newton's lifetime, there was great interest in the Temple of Solomon in Europe, due to the success of [[Juan Bautista Villalpando|Villalpando]]'s publications, and augmented by a vogue for detailed [[engraving]]s and [[physical model]]s presented in various galleries for public viewing. In 1628, [[Judah Leon Templo]] produced a model of the temple and surrounding Jerusalem, which was popular in its day. Around 1692, Gerhard Schott produced a highly detailed model of the temple for use in an opera in Hamburg composed by Christian Heinrich Postel. This immense {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} and {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=mid|-around}} model was later sold in 1725 and was exhibited in London as early as 1723, and then later temporarily installed at the London [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] from 1729 to 1730, where it could be viewed for [[Half crown (British coin)|half-a-crown]]. Isaac Newton's most comprehensive work on the temple, found within ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'', was published posthumously in 1728, only adding to the public interest in the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Crawley | first =W.

=== Newton's prophecy ===
Newton considered himself to be one of a select group of individuals who were specially chosen by God for the task of understanding Biblical scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 15 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a strong believer in prophetic interpretation of the Bible, and like many of his contemporaries in Protestant England, he developed a strong affinity and deep admiration for the teachings and works of [[Joseph Mede]]. Although he never wrote a cohesive body of work on prophecy, Newton's belief led him to write several treatises on the subject, including an unpublished guide for prophetic interpretation entitled ''Rules for interpreting the words &amp; language in Scripture''. In this manuscript he details the necessary requirements for what he considered to be the proper interpretation of the Bible.

In addition, Newton would spend much of his life seeking and revealing what could be considered a [[Bible Code]]. He placed a great deal of emphasis upon the interpretation of the [[Book of Revelation]], writing generously upon this book and authoring several manuscripts detailing his interpretations. Unlike a [[prophet]] in the true sense of the word, Newton relied upon existing Scripture to prophesy for him, believing his interpretations would set the record straight in the face of what he considered to be "so little understood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1754, 27 years after his death, Isaac Newton's treatise, ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]'' would be published, and although it does not argue any prophetic meaning, it does exemplify what Newton considered to be just one popular misunderstanding of Scripture.

Although Newton's approach to these studies could not be considered a scientific approach, he did write as if his findings were the result of evidence-based research.

=== 2060 ===
In late February and early March 2003, a large amount of media attention circulated around the globe regarding largely unknown and unpublished documents, evidently written by Isaac Newton, indicating that he believed the world would end no earlier than 2060. The story garnered vast amounts of public interest and found its way onto the front page of several widely distributed newspapers, including the UK's [[Daily Telegraph]], Canada's [[National Post]], Israel's [[Maariv]] and [[Yediot Aharonot]], and was also featured in an article in the scientific journal ''[[Canadian Journal of History]]''.&lt;ref name="Snobelen"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 15 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Television and internet stories in the following weeks heightened the exposure and ultimately would include the production of several documentary films focused upon the topic of the 2060 prediction and some of Newton's lesser known beliefs and practices.

The two documents detailing this prediction are currently housed within the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Snobelen" /&gt; Both were believed to be written toward the end of Newton's life, circa 1705, a time frame most notably established by the use of the full title of ''Sir'' Isaac Newton within portions of the documents.

These documents do not appear to have been written with the intention of publication and Newton expressed a strong personal dislike for individuals who provided specific dates for the [[Apocalypse]] purely for sensational value. Furthermore, he at no time provides a specific date for the end of the world in either of these documents.&lt;ref name="Snobelen" /&gt;

To understand the reasoning behind the 2060 prediction, an understanding of Newton's theological beliefs should be taken into account, particularly his apparent [[antitrinitarian]] beliefs and his Protestant views on the [[Papacy]].  Both of these lay essential to his calculations, which ultimately would provide the 2060 time frame.  See [[Isaac Newton's religious views]] for more details.

The first document, part of the Yahuda collection,&lt;ref&gt;Yahuda MS 7.3o, f. 8r&lt;/ref&gt; is a small letter slip, on the back of which is written haphazardly in Newton's hand:
{{quote|
Prop. 1. The 2300 prophetick days did not commence before the rise of the little horn of the He Goat.

2 Those day {{sic}} did not commence a[f]ter the destruction of Jerusalem &amp; ye Temple by the Romans A.[D.] 70.

3 The time times &amp; half a time did not commence before the year 800 in wch the Popes supremacy commenced

4 They did not commence after the re[ig]ne of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory the 7th]]. 1084

5 The 1290 days did not commence b[e]fore the year 842.

6 They did not commence after the reigne of Pope Greg. 7th. 1084

7 The diffence {{sic}} between the 1290 &amp; 1335 days are a parts of the seven weeks.

Therefore the 2300 years do not end before ye year 2132 nor after 2370.
The time times &amp; half time do n[o]t end before 2060 nor after [2344]
The 1290 days do not begin [this should read: end] before 2090 nor after 1374 [sic; Newton probably
means 2374]&lt;ref name="Snobelen" /&gt;
}}

The second reference to the 2060 prediction can be found in a folio,&lt;ref&gt;Yahuda MS 7.3g, f.
13v&lt;/ref&gt; in which Newton writes:
{{quote|So then the time times &amp; half a time are 42 months or 1260 days or three years &amp; an half, recconing twelve months to a yeare &amp; 30 days to a month as was done in the Calendar of the primitive year. And the days of short lived Beasts being put for the years of lived [sic for "long lived"] kingdoms, the period of 1260 days, if dated from the complete conquest of the three kings A.C. 800, will end A.C. 2060. It may end later, but I see no reason for its ending sooner. This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fancifull men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, &amp; by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail. Christ comes as a thief in the night, &amp; it is not for us to know the times &amp; seasons wch God hath put into his own breast.&lt;ref name="Snobelen" /&gt;}}

Clearly Newton's mathematical prediction of the end of the world is one derived from his interpretation of not only scripture, but also one based upon his theological viewpoint regarding specific chronological dates and events as he saw them.

Newton may not have been referring to the post 2060 event as a destructive act resulting in the annihilation of the globe and its inhabitants, but rather one in which he believed the world, as he saw it, was to be replaced with a new one based upon a transition to an era of divinely inspired peace. In Christian and [[Islamic theology]] this concept is often referred to as The [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and the establishment of The [[Kingdom of God]] on Earth.  In a separate manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;Yahuda MS 7.2a, f. 31r&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac Newton paraphrases Revelation 21 and 22 and relates the post 2060 events by writing:
{{quote|A new heaven &amp; new earth. New Jerusalem comes down from heaven prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband. The marriage supper. God dwells with men wipes away all tears from their eyes, gives them of ye fountain of living water &amp; creates all thin things new saying, It is done. The glory &amp; felicity of the New Jerusalem is represented by a building of Gold &amp; Gemms enlightened by the glory of God &amp; ye [[Lamb of God|Lamb]] &amp; watered by ye river of Paradise on ye banks of which grows the [[tree of life#Hebrew Bible/Christianity|tree of life]]. Into this city the kings of the earth do bring their glory &amp; that of the nations &amp; the saints reign for ever &amp; ever.&lt;ref name="Snobelen" /&gt;
}}

== Newton's chronology ==
Isaac Newton wrote extensively upon the historical topic of [[chronology]]. In 1728 ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'', an approximately 87,000-word composition that details the rise and history of various ancient kingdoms was published. The publication date of this work occurred after his death, although the majority of it had been reviewed for publication by Newton himself shortly before he died. As such, this work represents one of his last known personally reviewed publications. Sometime around 1701 he also produced a thirty page unpublished treatise entitled "The Original of Monarchies" detailing the rise of several monarchs throughout antiquity and tracing them back to the biblical figure of [[Noah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Newton | first = Isaac | title = The Original of Monarchies | url = http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00040&amp;mode=normalized | accessdate = 19 August 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071108210642/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00040&amp;mode=normalized | archivedate = 8 November 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's chronological writing is [[Eurocentric]], with the earliest records focusing upon [[Greece]], [[Anatolia]], [[Egypt]], and the [[Levant]]. Many of Newton's dates do not correlate with current historical knowledge. While Newton mentions several pre-historical events found within the Bible, the oldest actual historical date he provides is 1125 BC. In this entry he mentions [[Mephres]], a ruler over [[Upper Egypt]] from the territories of Syene to [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], and his successor [[Misphragmuthosis]]. However, during 1125 BC the Pharaoh of Egypt is now understood to be [[Ramesses IX]].

Although some of the dates Newton provides for various events are accurate by 17th century standards, [[archaeology]] as a form of modern science did not exist in Newton's time. In fact, the majority of the conclusionary dates which Newton cites are based on the works of [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Plutarch]], [[Homer]], and various other classical historians, authors, and poets; themselves often citing secondary sources and oral records of uncertain date. Newton's approach to chronology was focused upon gathering historical information from various sources found throughout antiquity and cataloguing them according to their appropriate date by his contemporary understanding, standards, and available source material.

=== Newton's Atlantis ===
Found within ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'', are several passages that directly mention the land of [[Atlantis]]. The first such passage is part of his ''Short Chronicle'' which indicates his belief that Homer's [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] left the island of [[Ogygia]] in 896 BC. In [[Greek mythology]], Ogygia was home to [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]], the daughter of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] (after whom Atlantis was named). Some scholars have suggested that Ogygia and Atlantis are locationally connected, or possibly the same island. From his writings it appears Newton may have shared this belief. Newton also lists Cadis or Cales as possible candidates for Ogygia, though does not cite his reasons for believing so.

== Newton and secret societies ==
Isaac Newton has often been associated with various [[secret societies]] and [[fraternal orders]] throughout history.  Due to the secretive nature of such organizations, lack of supportive publicized material, and dubious motives for claiming Newton's participation in these groups, it is difficult to establish his actual membership in any specific organization.&lt;ref name="NEWTONSFREEMASONRY"&gt;{{Cite book | last =Bauer | first =Alain | publicationdate =2007 | title = Isaac Newton's Freemasonary: The Alchemy of Science and Mysticism | publication-place = Originally published as: Aux origines de la franc-maçonnerie: Newton et les Newtoniens by Editions Dervy (2003)| publisher =Inner Traditions | pages =Book Excerpt – from Chapter 3 | isbn =1-59477-172-3 | doi = | oclc = | url =http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/book_bauer.html | accessdate =25 June 2008 | nopp =true | date =2007 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, Jewish Isaac Newton is believed to be a 33-degree [[Scottish Rite]] Freemason since he was one of the 1717 founders of the [[Ancient Grand Lodge of England|Lodge of England]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1= F. | last1 = Millikan | url = http://freemasoninformation.com/tag/isaac-newton | title = Dr. Bro.

Newton theological writings had substantially been kept secret for 280 years and first published only in 2007. After his death, the Royal Society refused to conserve them and give back to the Newton's family, recommending not to publish and not to talk about that to anyone.&lt;ref name= "Daniel-Apocalypse, Bollati" /&gt; The main exception was the book ''Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John'', first published in 1733 at London and [[Dublin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://archive.org/stream/observationsupon1733newt/observationsupon1733newt_djvu.txt | title = Observations upon the prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John : in two parts | accessdate = 16 September 2018 | publisher = J.

The ''Isaaci Newtoni Opera Omnia'' edited by [[Samuel Horsley]] in 1779-1785 didn't mention Newton religious writings, while the scientist Sir [[David Brewster]] (1781–1868) also read them and mentioned a very limited number in his biography of Newton.&lt;ref name= "Daniel-Apocalypse, Bollati" /&gt;
Sir [[John Conduit]], spouse of [[Catherine Barton]], the niece of Newton, passed to manuscripts to his descendants, the Counts of Portsmouth, since in 1875 the entire collection was donated to the [[University of Cambridge]] that in 1888 published in London the book titled ''A Catalogue of the Portsmouth Collection of Books and Papers written or belonging to Sir Isaac Newton''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://archive.org/details/catalogueofports00newtrich | title =

In the 1936 auction by Sotheby's, some writings were purchased by the economist Lord [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]] and then donated to the University Library, the [[King's College London|King's]] and the [[Trinity College London|Trinity College]].&lt;ref name= "Daniel-Apocalypse, Bollati" /&gt; 
Religious writing were purchased by [[Abraham Yahuda|A.S. Yahuda]], which, immigrated in U.S: in 1940, tried to donate to the University [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]], that didn't accept. Finally, they were placed to the University of Jerusalem, translated and published in a minimal part by F. E. Manuel, till the 2007 unvealing.&lt;ref name= "Daniel-Apocalypse, Bollati" /&gt;

Regardless of his own membership status, Newton was a known associate of many individuals who themselves have often been labeled as members of various esoteric groups. It is unclear if these associations were a result of his being a well established and prominently publicized scholar, an early member and sitting [[President of the Royal Society]] (1703–1727), a prominent figure of State and [[Master of the Mint]], a recognized [[Knight]], or if Newton actually sought active membership within these esoteric organizations himself.  Considering the nature and legality of alchemical practices during his lifetime, as well as his possession of various materials and manuscripts pertaining to alchemical research, Newton may very well have been a member of a group of like minded thinkers and colleagues. The organized level of this group (if in fact any existed), the level of their secrecy, as well as the depth of Newton's involvement within them, remains unclear.

Although Newton was largely considered a reclusive personality and not prone to socializing, during his lifetime being a member of "Societies" or "Clubs" was a very popular form of interpersonal networking. Considering his esteemed social status, it is probable that Newton would have had a least some contact with such groups at various levels. He was most certainly a member of [[The Royal Society]] of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge and the [[Spalding Gentlemen's Society]],&lt;ref name="Stukeley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stukeley|first=William|authorlink=William Stukeley|editor=Rob Iliffe |editor2=Scott Mandelbrote |title=Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's life|origyear= 1752 |url=http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00001|edition=transcript|date=2010|publisher=The Newton Project|location=University of Sussex|type=AHRC Newton Papers Project, Ms. 142, The Royal Society Library, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPALDING"&gt;{{cite web | title =Spalding Gentlemen's Society | url =http://www.spalding-gentlemens-society.org | accessdate =25 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, these are considered [[learned societies]], not [[secret societies|esoteric societies]]. Newton's membership status within any particular secret society remains verifiably allusive and largely speculative, however, it still lends itself to popular sensationalism.

=== Newton and the Rosicrucians ===
Perhaps the movement which most influenced Isaac Newton was [[Rosicrucianism]].&lt;ref name="LASTSORCERER"&gt;{{Cite book | last =White | first =Michael| publicationdate = | date =1999 | title =Isaac Newton: The Last Sorcerer | publisher =Da Capo Press | page =117 | isbn =0-7382-0143-X | url =https://books.google.com/?id=l2C3NV38tM0C | accessdate =25 June 2008 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Rosicrucian movement had caused a great deal of excitement within Europe's scholarly community during the early seventeenth century, by the time Newton had reached maturity the movement had become less sensationalized. However, the Rosicrucian movement still would have a profound influence upon Newton, particularly in regard to his alchemical work and philosophical thought.

The Rosicrucian belief in being specially chosen for the ability to communicate with angels or spirits is echoed in Newton's prophetic beliefs. Additionally, the Rosicrucians proclaimed to have the ability to live forever through the use of the ''[[Elixir of Life|elixir vitae]]'' and the ability to produce limitless amounts of time and gold from the use of the [[philosopher's stone]], which they claimed to have in their possession. Like Newton, the Rosicrucians were deeply religious, avowedly Christian, anti-Catholic, and highly politicised. Isaac Newton would have a deep interest in not just their alchemical pursuits, but also their belief in esoteric truths of the ancient past and the belief in enlightened individuals with the ability to gain insight into nature, the physical universe, and the spiritual realm.&lt;ref name="LASTSORCERER" /&gt;

At the time of his death, Isaac Newton had 169 books on the topic of alchemy in his personal library, and was believed to have considerably more books on this topic during his Cambridge years, though he may have sold them before moving to London in 1696. For its time, his was considered one of the finest alchemical libraries in the world. In his library, Newton left behind a heavily annotated personal copy of ''The Fame and Confession of the Fraternity R.C.'', by [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] which represents an English translation of [[Rosicrucian Manifestos|The Rosicrucian Manifestos]]. Newton also possessed copies of ''[[Themis Aurea]]'' and ''[[Symbola Aurea Mensae Duodecium]]'' by the learned alchemist [[Michael Maier]], both of which are significant early books about the Rosicrucian movement. These books were also extensively annotated by Newton.&lt;ref name="LASTSORCERER" /&gt;

Newton's ownership of these materials by no means denotes membership within any early Rosicrucian order. Furthermore, considering that his personal alchemical investigations were focused upon discovering materials which the Rosicrucians professed to already be in possession of long before he was born, would seem to some to exclude Newton from their membership. However, in religious terms, the fact that a saint might have 'found God' would not preclude others from the search – quite the opposite. The Ancient &amp; Mystical Order Rosae Crucis has always claimed Newton as a frater.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, H. Spencer 1981, ''Rosicrucian Questions and Answers with Complete History of the Rosicrucian Order'', 15th edn, The Rosicrucian Press Ltd, San Jose, Calif. USA.&lt;/ref&gt; During his own life, Newton was openly 'accused' of being a Rosicrucian, as were many members of The Royal Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yates |first=Frances A. |date=1972 |title=The Rosicrucian Enlightenment |publisher=Routledge |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not known for sure if Isaac Newton was in fact a Rosicrucian, and he never publicly identified himself as one, from his writings it does appear that he may have shared many of their sentiments and beliefs.

'''''Islam and the Future of Tolerance: A Dialogue''''' is a 2015 book collaboration between American author [[Sam Harris]] and the British activist [[Maajid Nawaz]].

The book is in dialogue format, and features an exchange between Harris, an [[atheist]] and a critic of religion, and Nawaz, an [[Islamism|Islamist]]-turned-[[liberalism|liberal]] activist.&lt;ref name=HUP /&gt; Harris argues that the doctrines of [[Islam]] are dangerous while Nawaz defends Islam by arguing that those dangerous doctrines have been circumvented by the tradition.&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapel Hill killings shine light on particular tensions between Islam and atheism|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/02/11/chapel-hill-killings-shine-light-on-particular-tensions-between-islam-and-atheism/|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nawaz further argues that like any other religion, Islam is open to reform and will find its place in a [[secularism|secular]] world.&lt;ref name=Goodreads&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam and the Future of Tolerance: A Dialogue|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25151238-islam-and-the-future-of-tolerance|publisher=Goodreads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is published with the explicit purpose of furthering difficult conversations about Islam without "devolving into [[bigotry]] or caricature".&lt;ref name=Goodreads/&gt; The book also explores the differences between the religion of Islam and the ideology of Islamism.&lt;ref name=DailyBeast&gt;{{cite web|title=Talking ‘Bout The True Believers|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/16/talking-bout-the-true-believers.html|publisher=Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''[[The Economist]]'', in its review, called it "a short but intensive dialogue" and noted that "at times, Mr Nawaz is disarmingly frank."&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite web|title=A liberal Muslim and a non-believer in search of common ground|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2015/10/muslim-atheist-debate?fsrc=gp_en|publisher=Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; It goes on to say that Nawaz acknowledges that reformist Muslims like himself are a minority, but he insists that Islamists are also a minority because the majority are conservative Muslims.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; After noting the percentages of political Islamists, liberals and social conservatives in the Muslim community, and predicting the odds of success of the liberals depending on the support they get from the conservatives, ''The Economist'' declares the task a "tall order" and states "no wonder Mr. Harris is politely sceptical."&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

The ''[[New Statesman]]'' called it "something of a unicorn" and credited the book for discussing "Islamism and jihadism from a historical as well as a philosophical angle, with no trace of sentiment or dogma."&lt;ref name=HUP /&gt; Brian Stewart in the ''[[National Review]]'' also rated it positively, declaring it "provocative and profane" and lauded the authors for "endeavoring to provide a spark".&lt;ref name="National Review"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Stewart |title=A Liberal Atheist and a Liberal Muslim Discuss the Problems of Contemporary Islam|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425169/sam-harris-maajid-nawaz-islam-book?target=author&amp;tid=5037|publisher=National Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' also gave it a positive review noting that "Harris, maintaining his provocative persona, asks questions and tosses ultimatums in the direction of Nawaz, who deftly replies with well-reasoned and thoughtful responses that will inform and inspire."&lt;ref name=publishersweekly&gt;{{cite web|title=Publishers Weekly|url=http://publishersweekly.com/978-0-674-08870-2|publisher=publishersweekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[cognitive scientist]] [[Steven Pinker]], "This honest and intelligent dialogue is a superb exploration of the intellectual and moral issues involved."&lt;ref name="HUP" /&gt;

In pre-published reviews, ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote, "A wider range of viewpoints might have made this discussion even more valuable, but readers with a knee-jerk opinion of Islam will learn a lot."&lt;ref name=kirkusreviews&gt;{{cite web|title=Kirkus Review|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sam-harris/islam-and-the-future-of-tolerance/|publisher=kirkusreviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the ''New York Journal of Books'', [[Tara Sonenshine]] wrote "The answer, they [Nawaz and Harris] seem to suggest, may rest in the ancient art of conversation, which this book offers."&lt;ref name=nyjournalofbooks&gt;{{cite web|title=NY Journal of Books|url=http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/islam-and|publisher=NY Journal of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Canadian author [[Irshad Manji]] wrote, "Their back-and-forth clarifies multiple confusions that plague the public conversation about Islam." She writes "Harris is right that liberals must end their silence about the religious motives behind much Islamist terror. At the same time, he ought to call out another double standard that feeds the liberal reflex to excuse Islamists: Atheists do not make nearly enough noise about hatred toward Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Manji |first=Irshad |authorlink=Irshad Manji |title='Islam and the Future of Tolerance' and 'Not in God's Name' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 3, 2015  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/islam-and-the-future-of-tolerance-and-not-in-gods-name.html |accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José María Canlás Sison''' (born February 8, 1939) is a Filipino writer and activist who founded the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] and added elements of [[Maoism]] to its philosophy.

Since August 2002, he has been classified as a "person supporting terrorism" by the United States. The [[European Union]]'s second highest court ruled to delist him as a "person supporting terrorism" and reversed a decision by member governments to freeze assets.&lt;ref name="iht.com"&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/11/europe/EU-GEN-EU-Court-Terror-List.php IHT, EU court overturns decision to freeze assets of exiled Philippine rebel, Palestinian group], ''nytimes.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="javno.com"&gt;[http://www.javno.com/en/world/clanak.php?id=61202 JAVNO, EU Court Overturns Two EU Terrorist Listings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928095543/http://www.javno.com/en/world/clanak.php?id=61202 |date=September 28, 2007 }}, ''dalje.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
{{BLP sources section|date=April 2015}}

Sison was born on February 8, 1939 in [[Cabugao, Ilocos Sur|Cabugao]] to a prominent landowning family with ancestry from [[Fujian]], China and with connections to other prominent clans such as the Crisologos, the Sollers, the Serranos, and the Singsons. His uncle was [[Teófilo Sison]], a prominent politician who was convicted in 1946 of having collaborated with the Japanese occupation forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://josemariasison.org/kinship-and-encounters-with-fvr/|title=Kinship and encounters with FVR|work=Jose Maria Sison|accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his childhood in [[Ilocos]], he talked to his barber about the [[Hukbalahap]] activity, and unlike his relatives, attended a public school before entering [[Ateneo de Manila University]] and later studying at [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]].

Sison graduated from the [[University of the Philippines]] in 1959 and then studied in [[Indonesia]] before returning to the Philippines and becoming a university professor of literature. He joined the Lavaite [[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas]] and was one of the founding members of both the [[Lapiang Manggagawa]] (which eventually became the Socialist Party) and [[Movement for the Advancement of Nationalism]]. In 1964, he co-founded the [[Kabataang Makabayan]], or Patriotic Youth, with Nilo S. Tayag. This organization organized youth against the [[Vietnam War]], [[Ferdinand Marcos]], [[Imperialism]], [[Bureaucrat Capitalism]] and [[Feudalism]]. The organization also spearheaded the studying of Maoism as part of 'the struggle'.

On December 26, 1968, he formed and led the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), an organization founded on [[Maoism|Marxism–Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought]], stemming from his experience as a youth leader and labor and [[land reform]] activist. This is known as the [[First Great Rectification Movement]] where Sison and other radical youth criticized the existing Party leadership, that was run under the Moscow leaning Lava and its failure. The reestablished CPP set its general political line as two-stage revolution comprising national-democratic as the first stage then proceeding to the socialist revolution. During this period, Sison went by the [[nom de guerre]] of Amado Guerrero, meaning "beloved warrior", under which he published the manifesto Philippine Society and Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Guidote, Caridad. The Intellectuals and the Problems of Development in the Philippines. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amado Guerrero (1970). [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/kabataangmakabayan64/psr.pdf&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:08:24 ''Philippine Society and Revolution].'' Revolutionary School of Mao Tsetung Thought.&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, the [[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930|old Communist Party]] sought to eliminate and marginalize Sison. However, the reorganized CPP had a larger base and renewed political line that attracted thousands to join its ranks. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
On March 29, 1969, the CPP, along with an HMB (Huk) faction led by [[Bernabe Buscayno]], organized the [[New People's Army]] (NPA), the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]-military wing of the Party, whose insurgencies around the Philippines, particularly in the northern part of the country, persist to this day. The NPA seeks to wage a peasant-worker revolutionary war in the countryside against landlords and foreign companies by hiding in mountains as strategy for protection.

Sison was arrested during the Marcos presidency and was imprisoned for almost 9 years. His experience was described in ''Prison &amp; Beyond'', a book of poetry released in 1986, which won the [[S.E.A. Write Award|Southeast Asia WRITE award]] for the Philippines.

The CPP has stated for 20 years that Sison is no longer involved in operational decisions and serves from Europe in an advisory role. In 1986, after he was freed from prison, Sison embarked on a world tour. In October he accepted the Southeast Asia WRITE award for a book of his poems from the Crown Prince of Thailand in [[Bangkok]]. While visiting the [[Netherlands]] three months later, he was informed that his passport had been revoked and that charges had been filed against him under the Anti-Subversion Law of the Philippines. Those charges were later dropped, as have subsequent charges filed by authorities in the Philippines.

==Personal life==
Sison met his wife, [[Julie de Lima]], when both studied at [[UP Diliman]]. Attending the same study groups, they grew closer and married in 1960. The couple had four children. Their youngest daughter was born in 1981 in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insights-philippines.de/sisoneng.htm|title=Jose Maria Sison in the dead end|publisher=|accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his wife Julie de Lima, Sison is the uncle of [[Leila de Lima]], now a Senator, and the former secretary of Philippine Department of Justice under the Administration of President [[Benigno S. Aquino III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/07/30/09/de-lima-so-what-if-im-jomas-kin|title=De Lima: So what if I'm Joma's kin?|author=ABS-CBN News|publisher=|accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile==
Sison went into exile in the [[Netherlands]] after [[Ferdinand Marcos|the Marcos]] regime ended. He had already been released from prison by the government of [[Corazón Aquino]] for the sake of "national reconciliation" and for his role in opposing Marcos. The release of Sison was vehemently protested by the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|military]]. It is reported that upon his release, Sison and his followers actively sought to discredit the Aquino government in the European media by speaking out on Aquino's [[human rights violations]] including the [[Mendiola Massacre]], in which members of the military were accused of firing on unarmed peasants in [[Manila]], killing 17 people.

He is the chairperson of the [[International League of Peoples' Struggle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the Chairperson |url=http://www.ilps.info/index.php/en/office-of-the-chairperson |publisher=ILPS |accessdate=4 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322030147/http://www.ilps.info/index.php/en/office-of-the-chairperson |archivedate=March 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the current Chief Political Consultant of the [[National Democratic Front (Philippines)|National Democratic Front]] of the Philippines. Since 1987, Sison has resided in the Netherlands where he is seeking asylum as a political refugee. A 2004 court ruling by the [[European Union]] endangers the residency status of Sison in Europe and he is expected to be expelled{{fact|date=January 2016}}. He has been charged with orchestrating the 2001 murder of Congressman [[Rodolfo Aguinaldo]] in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Arrest==
The International Crime Investigation Team of the Dutch National Criminal Investigation Department arrested Jose Maria Sison in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] on August 28, 2007. Sison was arrested for his alleged involvement from the Netherlands in three assassinations that took place in the Philippines: the murder of Romulo Kintanar in 2003, and the murders of Arturo Tabara and Stephen Ong in 2006. On the day of his arrest, Sison's apartment and eight apartments of his co-workers were searched by the Dutch National Criminal Investigation Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

There were no plans to hold the trial in the Philippines since there was no [[extradition|extradition request]] and the crimes Jose Maria Sison is accused of were committed in the [[Netherlands]]. Dutch lawyer, Victor Koppe said that Sison would enter a [[plea]] of not guilty during his indictment. He could have faced the maximum penalty of [[life imprisonment]]. 

On September 1, 2007, [[National Democratic Front (Philippines)|National Democratic Front]] peace panel chair Luis Jalandoni confirmed that the Dutch government was "maltreating" Sison because the Court detained him in [[solitary confinement]] for several weeks without access to media, newspapers, television, radio or visitors; it also denied him the right to bring prescription medicines to his cell. The place where Sison was held was the same one used by the late former [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] president [[Slobodan Milosevic]] who was held for war crimes and corruption. Meanwhile, protests were held in [[Indonesia]], Hong Kong, Australia, the United States and Canada. The [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP) feared Sison may be "''extra-judicially''" transferred to the United States. CPP spokesman [[Gregorio Rosal]] said that the U.S. may detain and subject Sison to extraordinary rendition in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] or some secret facility. U.S. ambassador Kristie Ann Kenney formally announced that the U.S. will extend support to the Dutch government to prosecute Sison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/58651/No-medicine-media-for-Joma-NDF-chair-scores-Dutch-govt|title=No medicine, media for Joma; NDF chair scores Dutch gov't|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York City, former [[United States Attorney General]] and left-wing human rights lawyer [[Ramsey Clark]] called for Sison's release and pledged assistance by joining the latter's legal defense team headed by Jan Fermon. Clark doubted Dutch authorities'
''validity and competency,'' since the murder charges originated in the [[Philippines]] and had already been dismissed by the country's Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=86051 Inquirer.net, Ex-US attorney general calls for Joma release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903114253/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=86051 |date=September  3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Committee DEFEND, an International group stated that the Dutch government [[tortured]] Sison at the National Penitentiary in [[Scheveningen]] (used by the [[Nazi]]s in [[World War II]] to torture [[Dutch resistance]] fighters). His wife, Julie De Lima failed to see him to give medicines and warm clothes on August 30, 2007.

On September 7, 2007, the Dutch court heard defense arguments for Sison, and stated that it would issue the [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] next week on whether to extend the [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]]. Supporters outside the [[Hague]] [[District Court]] chanted slogans while the wife, Julie De Lima stated that they complained to the International Committee of the [[Red Cross]]. Luis Jalandoni, chairman of the [[National Democratic Front (Philippines)|National Democratic Front]] accused the government of Prime Minister [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] of being "''a workhorse''" for Philippines President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] and for the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/07/europe/EU-GEN-Netherlands-Philippines-Rebel.php IHT, Dutch court hears arguments for release of Philippines communist leader accused of murder]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Lawyers Guild]] (NLG), a progressive [[bar association]] in New York headed by Marjorie Cohnhas, denounced the arrest Sison: "it exposes the hand of the Arroyo administration in yet another assault on the rights of the people to dissent and organize."&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=87312 Inquirer.net, U.S. lawyers denounce Sison arrest, detention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012153908/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=87312 |date=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sison will remain in jail until Thursday, but was provided TV, radio and medication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=87310 Inquirer.net, Sison to remain in jail until Thursday next week—Bayan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911190409/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=87310 |date=September 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2007, lawyers Edre Olalia and Rachel Pastores stated that Sison's lawyers will appeal the Dutch court's newly promulgated [[court ruling|ruling]] extending Sison's [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]] for 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/60230/Bayan-Dutch-court-orders-Joma-detained-another-90-days|title=Dutch court orders Joma detained another 90 days|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release from detention===
Dutch public [[prosecutor]]'s office's Wim de Bruin stated that Sison was released from jail at 10:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. on September 13, 2007. The court ruled that there was insufficient [[evidence]] to detain him on murder charges, specifically, if Sison "''had a [[conscious]] and close cooperation with those in the Philippines who carried out the deed''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=92327 Abs-Cbn Interactive, Dutch govt frees Joma]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.live-pr.com/en/dutch-court-orders-release-of-philippine-r1048144631.htm|title=Live-PR.com|publisher=|accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, 2007, Sison appeared before the [[Hague]] [[Court of Appeal]] [[Judicial panel|panel]] of 3 judges on the [[public prosecutor]]'s appeal against the [[district court]]'s September 13 [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] of release. 

On September 28, 2007, the Dutch Ambassador to the [[Philippines]], Robert Brinks, announced that 3 Dutch judicial officials and Dutch prosecution lawyer Wim De Bruin will visit the Philippines "''later this year''" to review the evidence against Jose Maria Sison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/MTNN20070929104316.html  Manila Bulletin,  Dutch judiciary officials to check evidence vs Joma]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day [[Leung Kwok Hung]], a Hong Kong politician and member of the [[April Fifth Action]] vowed to support Sison. Leung was in Europe at the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] assembly in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. He sits in the Hong Kong legislature as a member of the Finance and House Committees, and of the Legislative Panels on Constitutional Affairs, Housing, Manpower, Transport, and on Welfare Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/62340/CPP-Hong-Kong-lawmaker-to-drum-up-support-for-Joma|title=CPP: Hong Kong lawmaker to drum up support for Joma|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=December 26, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522025041/http://www.gmanews.tv/story/62340/CPP-Hong-Kong-lawmaker-to-drum-up-support-for-Joma|archivedate=May 22, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2007, the Dutch court dismissed the prosecution's appeal against the release Sison, confirming his freedom while the Dutch police continue to investigate: "the prosecution file lacks enough concrete clues that Sison can be directly linked to the assassinations which is needed to prosecute him as a perpetrator". However, the decision does not bar prosecution for murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvsydwPl28nX5VA5OjfZ29O_5hxA Afp.google.com, Dutch court upholds order to release Philippine communist leader] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024165621/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvsydwPl28nX5VA5OjfZ29O_5hxA |date=October 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Dutch Public Prosecutor's Office (per spokesman Wim de Bruin) stated that it did not drop the charges against Sison yet, who remains a suspect. De Bruin said: "No, you have to separate the criminal investigation by the police from the investigation by the examining judge in The Hague. So the judge decided to finish the investigation but the police investigation will be continued and that means that Mr. Sison is still a suspect".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=99949  Abs-cbn Interactive, Dutch prosecutor not dropping charges vs Joma]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch court on May 20, 2008, heard Sison's appeal against the Dutch Public Prosecutors Office's request to extend its investigation until December, since the investigators arrived in the Philippines in February and interviewed witnesses. At the trial, however, the new evidence showed that there were indeed attempts to kill him, in 1999 and 2000, while Kintanar's wife, Joy, directly accused Edwin Garcia in the murder of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=120203 Abs-Cbn Interactive, Sison claims govt agents tried to kill him]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch court scheduled the promulgation on the verdict on June 10, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080521-137828/Communist-leader-Sison-asks-Dutch-court-to-drop-case|title=Communist leader Sison asks Dutch court to drop case - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos|publisher=|accessdate=December 26, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226235924/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080521-137828/Communist-leader-Sison-asks-Dutch-court-to-drop-case|archivedate=December 26, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch District Court of The Hague on June 5, 2008 decided in camera "that the Public Prosecution Service may continue the prosecution of Jose Maria Sison for involvement in, among other matters, a number of murders committed in the Philippines in 2003 and 2004; that while the prosecution's case file still held insufficient evidence, the investigation was ongoing and should be given time to unfold."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=120759 abs-cbnnews.com, Dutch court allows prosecution anew of Joma Sison]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Former Senator [[Jovito Salonga]] accused Sison of orchestrating the [[1971 Plaza Miranda bombing]] during the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] Convention to force Marcos to suspend the [[writ of habeas corpus]] and sign Proclamation Number 1081 initiating the advent of Martial Law in the Philippines.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} This accusation comes from former CPP members such as [[Victor Corpuz]] and others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The Philippine National Police (PNP) filed a criminal case against Sison for the Plaza Miranda bombing, but the charges were dismissed for lack of evidence, with the dismissal order citing the complainant's filing criminal charges based on speculation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

On July 4, 2008, [[Manila]]'s RTC Executive Judge Reynaldo Ros assumed [[jurisdiction]] over the 1,551 pages records/cases of multiple murder lawsuit against Sison, [[Bayan Muna]] Representative [[Satur Ocampo]] and [[National Democratic Front (Philippines)|National Democratic Front]] member Luis Jalandoni after the Supreme Court's Third Division ordered a change of venue from the [[Hilongos]], Leyte RTC Branch 18, for safety reasons. The accused were charged of executing 30 farmers in 1985, in purging military assets within the [[New People's Army]] in Southern [[Leyte]]. 15 corpses were found in a [[mass grave]] in Inopacan, Leyte, in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080703-146279/Purging-case-vs-Sison-Jalandoni-Ocampo-moved-to-Manila|title=Purging case vs Sison, Jalandoni, Ocampo moved to Manila - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos|publisher=|accessdate=December 26, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226234438/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080703-146279/Purging-case-vs-Sison-Jalandoni-Ocampo-moved-to-Manila|archivedate=December 26, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=123998 abs-cbnnews, Manila court set to try multiple murder case vs Joma, Satur]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time when these alleged killings supposedly took place, Sison and Ocampo had long been under maximum detention of the Marcos regime. Sison, Ocampo, and other political detainees were only freed in 1986 after the first EDSA uprising of the same year.

The European Union's second highest court ruled to delist Sison and the Stichting Al-Aqsa group from the EU terror list since the 27-nation bloc failed to respect their right when blacklisted. The Luxembourg-based Court of Justice further reversed a decision by member governments to freeze the assets of Sison and the Netherlands-based Al-Aqsa Foundation, since the EU governments failed to inform them why the assets were frozen. Dekker said that EU lawyers in Brussels can lodge any appeal.&lt;ref name="iht.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="javno.com"/&gt; EU was also ordered to shoulder all the litigation expenses during the five-year appeal of Sison against the Dutch government and the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=84372 ABS-CBN Interactive, JAVNO, EU told to pay for Sison’s 5-yr legal fees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714142540/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=84372 |date=July 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sison however, is still part of the European Union's terrorism list according to the Royal Netherlands Embassy in the Philippines (July 13, 2007).

There is a provision in the EU Charter that when a court ruling goes against the council's decision, the latter will be upheld. The council has decided he is a terrorist, and because of this his assets should be frozen". Gonzalez said, the Luxembourg-based court did not categorically say Sison's assets should be released, but had merely questioned the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news2_july13_2007|title=Manila Standard Today - Latest News in the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This is a partial translation from the article in the French wikipedia--&gt;
'''Joseph Antoine Toussaint Dinouart''' (November 1, 1716 &amp;ndash; April 23, 1786) was a preacher, polemicist, compiler of sacred learning, and apologist for French feminism.

Born in [[Amiens]], he was ordained as a priest in there in 1740. In his youth, he showed a talent for [[Latin]] poetry, but soon neglected this in favor of his religious studies. After writing a short essay on women's rights, he had a falling out with his bishop and moved to Paris, where he joined the [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]] parish. He soon left, however, to tutor the son of a police lieutenant. This position gave him a stable yearly income and allowed Dinouart to devote himself to the study of literature.

In 1760, he founded the Journal ecclésiastique, which he edited until his death. The collected work of this journal numbers more than 100 volumes. It contains extracts from sermons, treatises on morality and piety, and research on ecclesiastical law and councils.

==Written works==
1. ''Lettre à l'abbé Gouget, au sujet des hymnes de Santeuil, adoptées dans le nouveau Bréviaire''
2. ''Le Triomphe du sexe''
3. ''Éloquence du corps dans le ministère de la chaire''
4. ''Manuel des pasteurs''
5. ''Exercitium diurnum, seu Manuale precum in usum et gratiam sacerdotum ; nunc denuo editum a sacerdote gallicano exsule''

==Translations==
Father Dinouart made numerous translations from Latin, including a translation of Cicero.

==Works edited==
Dinouart served as the editor or compiler of many books and journals. Among these was ''L'art de se taire, principalement en matière de religion'', a nearly perfection transcription of an earlier anonymous work entitled ''Conduite pour se taire et pour parler, principalement en matière de religion''. This was re-issued in Paris in 1987.

{{Contains Indic text}}

'''Karnapidasana''' is an [[Asana]] (yoga posture). It is translated as Ear Pressure Pose from [[Sanskrit]] (कपोतासन) [[IAST]]:''Karṇapīḍāsana''). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yoga.com/pose/ear-pressure-pose|title=Karnapidasana |website=yoga.com |access-date=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Contraindication Focus include Diarrhoea, Menstruation, Neck injuries, Blocked arteries and Pregnancy

== Modifications ==

1. Beginners should support their back with the hands .

3. Other variation is to bring your knees to your forehead and bring the hands to the ears

== Follow-up asanas ==

Counter asanas are [[Matsyasana]] (Fish Pose), [[Chaturanga Dandasana]] (Four-Limbed Staff Pose), [[Astavakrasana]] (Eight-Crooks Pose) and Titibasana (Firefly Pose)

== Anatomy ==
Karṇapīḍāsana is one of the counter pose to Sarvangasana (shoulder stand). The thoracic spine is in maximum flexation which can result in problems elsewhere in the spine or knees. The hip flexors and abdominal muscles are required to maintain the pose which stretches the extensors of the spine, the rhomboids and trapezius muscle. To avoid oversterching the cervical spine (neck), the yogi should be able to hold salamba sarvagasana for five minutes. And to protect the lumbar spine (torso) and knees the yogi should be able to stay in halasana for one minute. If the muscles are too short and the pose performed too passively, then the muscles being lengthened can be overstretched.

Born in the Mohawk village of Ossernenon, on the south side of the Mohawk River, she contracted [[smallpox]] in an epidemic; her family died and her face was scarred. She converted to Roman Catholicism at age nineteen, when she was renamed Kateri, baptized in honor of [[Saint Catherine of Siena]]. Refusing to marry, she left her village and moved for the remaining 5 years of her life to the [[Jesuit]] mission village of [[Kahnawake]], south of [[Montreal]] in [[New France]], now [[Canada]].

Tekakwitha took a vow of perpetual [[virginity]]. Upon her death at the age of 24, witnesses said that minutes later her scars vanished and her face appeared radiant and beautiful. Known for her [[virtue]] of [[chastity]] and [[mortification of the flesh]], as well as being [[shunned]] by some of her tribe for her religious conversion to [[Catholicism]], she is the fourth [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] to be venerated in the Roman Catholic Church and the first to be canonized.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saint Juan Diego]] and two other [[Oaxaca]]n Indians were first accorded the honor of veneration.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the pontificate of [[Pope John Paul II]], she was [[Beatification|beatified]] in 1980 and canonized by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] at [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] on 21 October 2012.&lt;ref name='nytimesOct22'&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/nyregion/pope-canonizes-kateri-tekewitha-and-marianne-cope.html Pope Canonizes 7 Saints, Including 2 With New York Ties], ''The New York Times'', 22 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EWTN Televised Broadcast: "Public Consistory for the Creation of New Cardinals", Rome, February 18, 2012. Saint Peter's Basilica. Closing remarks before recession preceded by Cardinal Agostino Vallini.&lt;/ref&gt; Various miracles and supernatural events are attributed to her intercession.

==Early life and education==
''Tekakwitha'' is the name the girl was given by her Mohawk people. It translates to "She who bumps into things."&lt;ref name="National Saint Kateri Tekakwitha Shrine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katerishrine.com/kateri.html |title=Tekakwitha Newsletter |publisher=Katerishrine.com |date=2012-10-21 |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- OldSigma: I believe Fr Cuoq's translation is more authoritative (L'exique de la langue Iroquoise). --&gt;  She was born around 1656 in the Mohawk village of Ossernenon considerably west of present-day [[Auriesville, New York]]. (A nineteenth-century tradition that Auriesville developed at the site of Ossernenon has been disproved by archeological findings, according to Dean R. Snow and other specialists in Native American history in New York.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n0Fv_6esE8cC&amp;dq=Johannes+Megapolensis&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s "Introduction"], ''In Mohawk Country: Early Narratives about a Native People''], ed. Dean R. Snow, Charles T. Gehring, William A. Starna, Syracuse University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;)

She was the daughter of Kenneronkwa, a Mohawk chief, and Tagaskouita, an [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] woman, who had been captured in a raid, then adopted and assimilated into the tribe. Tagaskouita had been [[baptized]] [[Roman Catholic]] and educated by French missionaries in [[Trois-Rivières]], east of Montreal. &lt;!-- Old Sigma: My research has not uncovered any source to substantiate the names given here for her parents. One published analysis (Béchard, Bulletin) explores available records to determine her mother's baptismal name, but the results of that research are only suggestive. --&gt;Mohawk warriors captured her and took her to their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Juliette Lavergne, ''La Vie gracieuse de Catherine Tekakwitha,'' Editions A.C.F., Montreal, 1934, pp. 13&amp;ndash;43&lt;/ref&gt; Tagaskouita eventually married Kenneronkwa.&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint&gt;{{Cite book|last=Greer|first=Allan|title=Mohawk Saint: Catherine Tekakwitha and the Jesuits|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=3–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tekakwitha was the first of their two children. A brother followed.

Tekakwitha's original village was highly diverse, as the Mohawk were absorbing many captured natives of other tribes, particularly their competitors the [[Huron people|Huron]], to replace people who died from European diseases or warfare. While from different backgrounds, such captives were adopted into the tribe to become full members and were expected to fully assimilate as Mohawk.

The Mohawk suffered a severe [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]] from 1661 to 1663, causing high fatalities. When Tekakwitha was around four years old, her baby brother and both her parents died of smallpox. She survived, but was left with facial scars and impaired eyesight.&lt;ref name="Bonaparte"/&gt; She was adopted by her father's sister and her husband, a chief of the Turtle Clan. Before the epidemic, in 1659 some Mohawk had founded a new village on the north side of the river, which they called Caughnawaga&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt; ("at the wild water" in the Mohawk language).&lt;ref&gt;Francis X. Weiser, S.J. ''Kateri Tekakwitha'', Kateri Center, Caughnawaga, Canada, 1972, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors of Ossernenon moved to that village.

The Jesuits’ account of Tekakwitha said that she was a modest girl who avoided social gatherings; she covered much of her head with a blanket because of the smallpox scars. They said that, as an orphan, the girl was under the care of uninterested relatives. But, according to Mohawk practices, she was probably well taken care of by her clan, her mother and uncle's extended family, with whom she lived in the [[longhouse]]. She became skilled at traditional women’s arts, which included making clothing and belts from animal skins; weaving mats, baskets and boxes from reeds and grasses; and preparing food from game, crops and gathered produce. She took part in the women's seasonal planting and intermittent weeding. As was the custom, she was pressured to consider marriage around age thirteen, but she refused.&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt;

==Upheaval and invasions==
Tekakwitha grew up in a period of upheaval, as the Mohawk interacted with French and Dutch colonists, who were competing in the lucrative fur trade. The Mohawk originally traded with the Dutch, who had settled in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]]. The French traded with and were allied with the [[Huron people|Huron]].

Trying to make inroads in [[Iroquois]] territory, the French attacked the Mohawk in present-day central New York in 1666. After driving the people from their homes, the French burned the three Mohawk villages on the south side of the river, destroying the longhouses, wigwams, and the women's corn and squash fields. Tekakwitha, around ten years old, fled with her new family into a cold October forest.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Sargent, ''Catherine Tekakwitha'', Longmans, Green &amp; Co., New York, 1936, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat by the French forces, the Mohawk were forced into a peace treaty that required them to accept Jesuit missionaries in their villages. The Jesuits established a mission that later developed as [[Auriesville, New York]]. While there, the Jesuits studied Mohawk and other native languages in order to reach the people. They spoke of Christianity in terms with which the Mohawk could identify. In his work on Tekakwitha, Darren Bonaparte notes the parallels between some elements of Mohawk and Christian belief. For instance, the Jesuits used the word ''Karonhià:ke,'' the Mohawk name for Sky World, as the word for heaven in the [[Lord’s Prayer]] in Mohawk. "This was not just a linguistic shortcut, but a conceptual bridge from one cosmology to another."&lt;ref name="Bonaparte"/&gt;

The Mohawk settled Caughnawaga on the north bank, west of the present-day town of [[Fonda, New York]]. In 1667, when Tekakwitha was 11 years old, she met the Jesuit missionaries Jacques Frémin, Jacques Bruyas, and Jean Pierron, who had come to the village.&lt;ref name=TheMaking&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koppedrayer|first=K. I.|title=The Making of the First Iroquois Virgin: Early Jesuit Biographies of the Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=40|issue=2|pages=277–306|publisher=Duke University Press|doi=10.2307/482204 |jstor=482204|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her uncle opposed any contact with them because he did not want her to convert to Christianity. One of his older daughters had already left Caughnawaga to go to Kahnawake, the Catholic mission village across the St. Lawrence River from [[Montreal]].

In the summer of 1669, several hundred [[Mohican people|Mohican]] warriors, advancing from the east, launched a dawn attack on Caughnawaga. Rousing quickly to the defense, Mohawk villagers fought off the invaders, who kept Caughnawaga under siege for three days. Tekakwitha, now around 13 years old, joined other girls to help priest Jean Pierron tend to the wounded, bury the dead, and carry food and water to the defending warriors on the palisades.

When reinforcements arrived from other Mohawk villages, the defenders drove the Mohican warriors into retreat. The victorious Mohawk pursued the Mohican warriors, attacking them in the forest, killing over 80 and capturing several others. Returning to Caughnawaga amid widespread celebration, the victors tortured the captive Mohicans—thirteen men and four women—for two afternoons in succession, planning to execute them on the third. Pierron, tending to the captives, implored the torturers to stop, but they ignored him. Pierron instructed the captives in Catholic doctrine as best he could and baptized them before they died under torture.&lt;ref&gt;Francis X. Weiser, S.J. ''Kateri Tekakwitha'', Kateri Center, Caughnawaga, Canada, 1972, pp. 50-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feast of the Dead==
Later in 1669, the Iroquois Feast of the Dead, held every ten years, was convened at Caughnawaga. Some [[Oneida people]] came, along with [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] led by their famous sachem [[Daniel Garacontié|Garakontié]]. The remains of Tekakwitha's parents, along with the many others who had died in the previous decade, were to be carefully exhumed, so that their souls could be released to wander to the spirit land to the west.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Sargent, ''Catherine Tekakwitha'', Longmans, Green &amp; Co., New York, 1936, p. 167. Also, J.N.B. Hewitt, "The Iroquoian Concept of the Soul," ''Journal of American Folk-Lore'', vol. 8, Boston, 1895, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1936 book about Tekakwitha, Father Pierron attacked the beliefs and logic of the Feast of the Dead. The assembled Iroquois, upset over his remarks, ordered him to be silent. But Pierron continued, telling the Iroquois to give up their "superstitious" rites. Under Garakontié's protection, Pierron finished his speech. He demanded that, to secure continued friendship with the French, the Iroquois give up their Feast of the Dead, their faith in dreams as a guide to action, and the worship of their war god. At length, the assembled Iroquois relented. Exchanging gifts with priest Pierron, they promised to give up the customs he had denounced.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Sargent, ''Catherine Tekakwitha'', Longmans, Green &amp; Co., New York, 1936, pp. 167-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Garakontié later converted to Christianity.

==A chief converts==
In 1671, Mohawk chief Ganeagowa, who had led his warriors to victory against the Mohican, returned from a long hunting trip in the north to announce he had become a Christian. He had come upon the Catholic Iroquois village set up by Jesuits at [[La Prairie, Quebec|La Prairie]], southeast of Montreal. There he made friendly contact with priest Jacques Frémin, who had served as a missionary in Mohawk country. Influenced by the Catholic faith of the Iroquois villagers and of his own wife Satékon, Ganeagowa received instruction for several months from Father Frémin, who accepted him into the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Francis X. Weiser, S.J. ''Kateri Tekakwitha'', Kateri Center, Caughnawaga, Canada, 1972, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family pressures==
By the time Tekakwitha turned 17 around 1673, her adoptive mother (her father's sister) and aunt (uncle's sister) had become concerned over her lack of interest in marriage. They tried to arrange her marriage to a young Mohawk man by instructing him to sit down beside her. They indicated to Tekakwitha that the young man wanted to marry her. Accordingly, they pressured her to offer him a certain dish made with corn.&lt;ref name="Rev. Edward Sherman 2007 106"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Tekakwitha Holy Native, Mohawk Virgin 1656-1680|year=2007|publisher=Fine Print Inc.|location=Grand Forks, ND|page=106|author=Rev. Edward Sherman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iroquois custom regarded this as a woman's sign of openness to marriage. Tekakwitha fled the cabin and hid from her family in a nearby field. Tekakwitha was said to have been punished by her aunts with ridicule, threats, and harsh workloads. But Tekakwitha continued to resist marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lecompte, S.J., ''Glory of the Mohawks: The Life of the Venerable Catherine Tekakwitha'', translated by Florence Ralston Werum, FRSA, Bruce Publishing Co., Milwaukee, 1944, p. 28; Francis X. Weiser, S.J., ''Kateri Tekakwitha'', Kateri Center, Caughnawaga, Canada, 1972, pp. 65-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, her aunts gave up their efforts to get her to marry.

In the spring of 1674 at age eighteen, Tekakwitha met the Jesuit Father Jacques de Lamberville, who was visiting in the village. Most of the women were out harvesting corn, but Tekakwitha had injured her foot and was in the cabin.&lt;ref name="Rev. Edward Sherman 2007 106"/&gt; In the presence of others, Tekakwitha told him her story and her desire to become a Christian. After this she started studying the catechism with him.&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt;

==Conversion and Kahnawake==
Lamberville wrote in his journal in the years after her death about Tekakwitha. This text described her, before she was baptized, as a girl who was mild-mannered and behaved very well. Lamberville also stated that Kateri did everything she could in order to stay holy in a secular society, which often caused minor conflicts with her longhouse residents. These conflicts suggested no violence, which contradicts future texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greer|first1=Allan|chapter=Savage/Saint: The Lives of Kateri Tekakwitha|editors=Sylvie Dépatie, Catherine Desbarats, Danielle Gauvreau, Mario Lalancette, Thomas Wien|title=Vingt ans après, Habitants et marchands: Lectures de l'histoire des XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles canadiens|date=1998|page=146|jstor=j.ctt812wj }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging her ready, Lamberville baptized Tekakwitha at the age of 19, on [[Easter Sunday]], April 18, 1676.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lodi|first=Enzo|title=Saints of the Roman Calendar (Eng.

After Kateri was baptized, she remained in Caughnawauga for another 6 months. Some Mohawks opposed her conversion and accused her of sorcery.&lt;ref name=TheMaking /&gt; Lamberville suggested that she go to the Jesuit mission of [[Kahnawake]], located south of Montreal on the St. Lawrence River, where other native converts had gathered. Catherine joined them in 1677.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Je Me Souviens: Histoire du Québec et du Canada|year=1995|publisher=Éditions du Renouveau Pédagogique Inc.|location=Ottawa|page=32|author=Dominique Roy et Marcel Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tekakwitha was said to have put thorns on her sleeping mat and to have lain on them while praying for the conversion and forgiveness of her kinsmen. Piercing the body to draw blood was a traditional practice of the Mohawk and other Iroquois nations. She lived at Kahnawake the remaining two years of her life. She learned more about Christianity under her mentor Anastasia, who taught her about the practice of repenting for one’s sins. When the women learned of [[nun]]s, they wanted to form their own convent and created an informal association of devout women.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Father Cholonec wrote that Tekakwitha said,
{{quote|I have deliberated enough. For a long time my decision on what I will do has been made. I have consecrated myself entirely to Jesus, son of Mary, I have chosen Him for husband and He alone will take me for wife.&lt;ref name=TheMaking /&gt;}}

The Church considers that in 1679, with her decision on the [[Feast of the Annunciation]], her conversion was truly completed and she became the "first virgin" among the Mohawk.&lt;ref name="TheMaking"/&gt;

==Mission du Sault St. Louis: Kahnawake==
The Jesuits had founded Kahnawake for the religious conversion of the natives. When it began, the natives built their traditional longhouses for residences. They also built a longhouse to be used as a chapel by the Jesuits. As a missionary settlement, Kahnawake was at risk of being attacked by members of the Iroquois Confederacy who had not converted to Catholicism.&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt; (While it attracted other Iroquois, it was predominantly Mohawk, the major tribe in eastern New York.)

After Catherine's arrival, she shared the longhouse of her older sister and her husband. She would have known other people in the longhouse who had migrated from their former village of Gandaouagué (also spelled [[Caughnawaga Indian Village Site|Caughnawaga]]). Her mother’s close friend, Anastasia Tegonhatsiongo, was clan matron of the longhouse. Anastasia and other Mohawk women introduced Tekakwitha to the regular practices of Christianity.&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt;

===Chauchetière and Cholenec===
[[Claude Chauchetière]] and [[Pierre Cholenec]] were Jesuit priests who played important roles in Tekakwitha’s life. Both were based in New France and in Kahnawake. Chauchetière was the first to write a biography of Tekakwitha’s life, followed by Cholenec, in 1695 and 1696, respectively.&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt; Cholenec arrived in New France in 1672, before Chauchetière.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Béchard|first=Henri|title=Cholenec, Pierre|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cholenec_pierre_2E.html |volume=2|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Father Cholenec introduced whips, hair shirts and iron girdles, traditional items of Catholic mortification, to the converts at Kahnawake. He wanted them to adopt these rather than use Mohawk ritual practices.&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt; Both Chauchetière and Tekakwitha arrived in Kahnawake the same year, in 1677.

He later wrote about having been very impressed by her, as he had not expected a native to be so pious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DCB |last=Jaenen|first=C. J.|title=Chauchetière, Claude|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/chauchetiere_claude_2E.html|volume=2|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chauchetière came to believe that Catherine Tekakwitha was a saint. Jesuits generally thought that the natives needed Christian guidance to be set on the right path. Chauchetière acknowledged that close contact with and deeper knowledge of the natives in Kahnawake changed some of his set notions about the people and about differences among human cultures.&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt; In his biography of Kateri, he stressed her "charity, industry, purity, and fortitude."&lt;ref name="Choquette"&gt;[http://www.h-france.net/vol5reviews/choquette.html Leslie Choquette, Review: Allan Greer, ''Mohawk Saint''], H-France Review, Vol. 5 (October 2005), No. 109; accessed 25 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Cholenec stressed her virginity, perhaps to counter white stereotypes at the time characterizing Indian women as promiscuous.&lt;ref name="Choquette"/&gt;

[[File:KateriTekakwitha.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of Kateri Tekakwitha]]

==Penances==
Tekakwitha believed in the value of offered suffering. She did not eat very much and was said to add undesirable tastes to her food. She would lie on a mat with thorns. There was a custom among some Native American peoples of the time of piercing oneself with thorns in thanksgiving for some good or an offering for the needs of one's self or others. Knowing the terrible burns given to prisoners, she burned herself. Her spiritual counselor, Anastasia, seems to have encouraged her penances. With her friend Marie-Thérèse, Tekakwitha readily took up penances. Her health had always been poor and it weakened. Marie-Thérèse sought the help of Father Chauchetière. He scolded the young women, saying that penance must be used in moderation. He told the two that they must have him approve their penances lest they become unreasonable. Tekakwitha listened to the priest. From then on, Tekakwitha practiced whatever penance the priest would allow her, but nothing more.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Friendship with Marie-Thérèse==
Upon her arrival in the Christian community, Catherine befriended Marie-Thérèse. They prayed together often. Marie Skarichions told Catherine and Marie-Thérèse about women religious. Through their mutual quest, the two women had a strong "spiritual friendship," as described by the Jesuits.&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt; The two women influenced a circle of associates. When they asked the Jesuits for permission to form a group of native disciples, they were told they were too "young in faith" for such a group. The women continued to practice their faith together.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Death and appearances==
Around [[Holy Week]] of 1680, friends noted that Tekakwitha's health was failing. When people knew she had but a few hours left, villagers gathered together, accompanied by the priests Chauchetière and Cholenec, the latter providing the [[last rites]].&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt; Catherine Tekakwitha died at around 15:00 (3 p.m.) on [[Holy Wednesday]], April 17, 1680, at the age of 23 or 24, in the arms of her friend Marie-Therèse. Chauchetière reports her final words were, "Jesus, Mary, I love you."&lt;ref name=cccb/&gt;

After her death, the people noticed a physical change. Cholenec later wrote, "This face, so marked and swarthy, suddenly changed about a quarter of an hour after her death, and became in a moment so beautiful and so white that I observed it immediately."{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Her smallpox scars were said to disappear.

Tekakwitha purportedly appeared to three individuals in the weeks after her death; her mentor Anastasia Tegonhatsiongo, her friend Marie-Therèse Tegaiaguenta, and Father Chauchetière. Anastasia said that, while crying over the death of her spiritual daughter, she looked up to see Catherine "kneeling at the foot" of her mattress, "holding a wooden cross that shone like the sun." Marie-Thérèse reported that she was awakened at night by a knocking on her wall, and a voice asked if she were awake, adding, "I’ve come to say good-bye; I’m on my way to heaven." Marie-Thérèse went outside but saw no one; she heard a voice murmur, "Adieu, Adieu, go tell the father that I’m going to heaven." Chauchetière meanwhile said he saw Catherine at her grave; he said she appeared in "baroque splendour; for two hours he gazed upon her" and "her face lifted toward heaven as if in ecstasy."&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt;

Chauchetière had a chapel built near Kateri's gravesite. By 1684, pilgrimages had begun to honour her there. The Jesuits turned her bones to dust and set the ashes within the "newly rebuilt mission chapel." This symbolized her presence on earth, and her remains were sometimes used as relics for healing.

==Epitaph==
Tekakwitha's gravestone reads:&lt;center&gt;{{quote|Kateri Tekakwitha&lt;br&gt;
Ownkeonweke Katsitsiio Teonsitsianekaron&lt;br&gt;
The fairest flower that ever bloomed among red men.}}&lt;/center&gt;

The first account of Kateri Tekakwitha was not published until 1715. Because of Tekakwitha's notable path to [[chastity]], she is often referred to as a [[Lily flower|lily]], a traditional symbol of purity associated with the [[Virgin Mary]] since the medieval period. Religious images of Tekakwitha are often decorated with a [[lily flower|lily]] and cross, with feathers or turtle as cultural accessories alluding to her Native American birth. Colloquial terms for Tekakwitha are ''The Lily of the Mohawks'' (most notable), the ''Mohawk Maiden'', the ''Pure and Tender Lily'', the ''Flower among True Men'', the ''Lily of Purity'' and ''The New Star of the New World''. Her tribal neighbors referred to her as "the fairest flower that ever bloomed among the redmen."&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, Margaret and Stephen, "Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha, Lily of this Mohawks," Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions brochure, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Her virtues are considered an [[ecumenical]] bridge between Mohawk and European cultures.

==Religious veneration==
[[File:Kateri Tekakwitha au Québec.JPG|thumb|right|Statue of Kateri Tekakwitha by [[Joseph-Émile Brunet]] at the [[Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré]], near [[Quebec City]].]]
For some time after her death, Tekakwitha was considered an honorary yet unofficial patroness of [[Montreal]], Canada, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. Fifty years after her death, a convent for Native American nuns opened in Mexico. They have prayed for her and supported her [[canonization]].

Indian Catholic missions and bishops in the 1880s wrote a petition pushing for the veneration of Tekakwitha. In that petition, they stated that she was pure and holy in addition to being a gift unto the Native Americans. They asked for the venerations of Tekakwitha as well as Jesuit Father [[Isaac Jogues]] and Brother René Goupil, two Catholic Missionaries who had been slain by the Mohawks in Osernnenon a few decades before Kateri’s birth. They concluded their petition by stating that these venerations will help encourage Catholicism among other Indians.&lt;ref name="Marquette U"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thiel|first1=Mark|last2=Vecsey|first2=Christopher|title=Native Footsteps: Along the Path of Saint Kateri Tekakwitha|date=2013|publisher=Marquette U|location=Milwaukee|pages=45–6, 49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process for Tekakwitha's [[canonization]] was initiated by United States Catholics at the [[Third Plenary Council of Baltimore]] in 1884, followed by Canadian Catholics. January 3, 1943, [[Pope Pius XII]] declared her [[venerable]]. She was beatified as Catherine Tekakwitha on June 22, 1980, by [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS%2053%20&amp;#91;1961&amp;#93;%20-%20ocr.pdf ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' LIII (1961), p. 82]. Note: The official beatification register postulated by Rev. Anton Witwer, [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] to the Roman Catholic Church bears her name as Catherine. The 1961 edition of ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'' refers in Latin to her cause of beatification as that of "Ven. Catharinae Tekakwitha, virginis".&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, 2011, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints certified a second miracle through her intercession, signed by [[Pope Benedict XVI]], which paved the way for pending [[canonization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/12/19/pope_oks_7_new_saints_including_hawaiis_marianne/singleton/ |title=Pope OKs 7 New Saints, Including Hawaii’s Marianne |publisher=Salon |date=December 19, 2011 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 18, 2012, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] decreed that Tekakwitha be canonized. Speaking in Latin, he used the form "Catharina Tekakwitha"; the official booklet of the ceremony referred to her in English and Italian, as "Kateri Tekakwitha".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/libretti/2012/20120218.pdf ''Concistoro Ordinario Pubblico ... Basilica Vaticana, 18 febbraio 2012''], pp. 33–39&lt;/ref&gt; She was canonized on October 21, 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI.&lt;ref name=cccb&gt;[http://www.cccb.ca/site/eng/component/content/article/64/3375-canonization-of-kateri-tekakwitha-21-october-2012 Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops]&lt;/ref&gt; In the official canonization rite booklet, "Catherine" is used in the English and French biographies and "Kateri" in the translation of the rite itself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/libretti/2012/20121021.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; She is the first [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] woman of North America to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church.

Tekakwitha is featured in four national shrines in the United States: the [[National Shrine of Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha]] in [[Fonda, New York]]; the [[National Shrine of the North American Martyrs]] in [[Auriesville, New York]]; the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]] in Washington, D.C.; and The National Shrine of the Cross in the Woods, an open-air sanctuary in [[Indian River, Michigan]]. The design of the latter shrine was inspired by Kateri's habit of placing small wooden crosses throughout the woods. One statue on the grounds shows her cradling a cross in her arms, surrounded by turtles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossinthewoods.com/ |title=The National Shrine of Cross in the Woods |publisher=Crossinthewoods.com |date=2016-11-12 |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue of Tekakwitha is installed outside the [[Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré]] in Quebec, Canada. Another is installed at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].

Tekakwitha has been featured in recently created religious works. In 2007, the Grand [[Retablo]], a 40-foot-high work by Spanish artisans, was installed behind the main altar of the [[Mission Basilica San Juan Capistrano]] in [[Orange County, California]]. It features Catherine Tekakwitha, [[Junipero Serra]], [[St. Joseph]], and [[Francis of Assisi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Retablo draws crowds at Mission Basilica |author=Ignatin, Heather |url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/homepage/abox/article_1662425.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910135941/http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/homepage/abox/article_1662425.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |work=[[Orange County Register]] |date=April 19, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionsjc.com/pdf/press/Press2007Retablo.pdf "Grand Retablo en Route to San Juan Capistrano, Installation expected March 19"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030101728/http://www.missionsjc.com/pdf/press/Press2007Retablo.pdf |date=October 30, 2008 }}, Mission San Juan Capistrano, 9 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miracles==
[[File:Saint John Neumann Catholic Church (Sunbury, Ohio) - interior, statue of Saint Kateri Tekakwitha.jpg|thumb|A statue of Saint Kateri Tekakwitha in Saint John Neumann Catholic Church, Sunbury, Ohio]]
Joseph Kellogg was a Protestant child captured by Natives in the eighteenth century and eventually returned to his home. Twelve months later, he caught [[smallpox]]. The Jesuits helped treat him, but he was not recovering. They had relics from Tekakwitha’s grave, but did not want to use them on a non-Catholic. One Jesuit told Kellogg that, if he would become a Roman Catholic, help would come to him. Joseph did so. The Jesuit gave him a piece of decayed wood from Kateri's coffin, which is said to have made him heal. The historian Allan Greer takes this account to mean that Tekakwitha was known in 18th-century New France, and she was already perceived to have healing abilities.&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt;

Other miracles were attributed to Kateri: Father Rémy recovered his hearing and a nun in Montreal was cured by using items formerly belonging to Catherine. Such incidents were evidence that Catherine was possibly a saint. Following the death of a person, sainthood is symbolized by events that show the rejection of death. It is also represented by a duality of pain and a neutralisation of the other’s pain (all shown by her reputed miracles in New France).&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt; Father Chauchetière told settlers in La Prairie to pray to Catherine for intercession with illnesses. Due to the Jesuits' superior system of publicizing material, his words and Catherine’s fame were said to reach Jesuits in China and their converts.&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt;

As people believed in her healing powers, some collected earth from her gravesite and wore it in bags as a relic. One woman said she was saved from pneumonia ("grande maladie du rhume"); she gave the pendant to her husband, who was healed from his disease.&lt;ref name=MohawkSaint /&gt;

On December 19, 2011, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] approved the second miracle needed for Kateri's canonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/28579.php?index=28579&amp;lang=en |title=PROMULGAZIONE DI DECRETI DELLA CONGREGAZIONE DELLE CAUSE DEI SANTI |publisher=catholica.va |date=December 19, 2011 |accessdate=2012-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602174845/http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/28579.php?index=28579&amp;lang=en |archivedate=June 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorized miracle dates from 2006, when a young boy in Washington state survived a severe flesh-eating bacterium. Doctors had been unable to stop the progress of the disease by surgery and advised his parents he was likely to die. The boy received the sacrament of [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]] from a Catholic priest. As the boy is half [[Lummi Indian]], the parents said they prayed through Tekakwitha for divine [[intercession]], as did their family and friends, and an extended network contacted through their son's classmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Discepolo |first=John |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/komo/article/Vatican-calls-Whatcom-boy-s-survival-a-miracle-2414150.php |title=Vatican calls Whatcom boy's survival a miracle |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=December 20, 2011 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Catholic nun, Sister Kateri Mitchell, visited the boy's bedside and placed a relic of Tekakwitha, a bone fragment, against his body and prayed together with his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19996957|title=Kateri Tekakwitha: First Catholic Native American saint |publisher=BBC News |date=October 19, 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the infection stopped its progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/20/boy-miracle-cure-makes-first-native-american-saint|title=Boy's miracle cure makes first Native American saint |agency=Associated Press |date=October 20, 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Mohawk scholar Orenda Boucher noted that despite extensive support for canonization of Tekakwitha, some traditional Mohawk see her as a connection to the worst aspects of colonialism. They do not believe that she embodied nor reflected traditional Mohawk womanhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/1st-native-american-saint-stirs-pride-skepticism-164656143.html |title=1st Native American saint stirs pride, skepticism|last=Esch|first=Mary|publisher=[[Yahoo! News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Protestants directed negative response towards Tekakwitha’s veneration. Historian Allan Greer, who studied connections between Tekakwitha and anti-Catholicism in America, stated that Catholics needed her in a society that viewed the Church as foreign. Protestants were afraid that the canonizations of US saints would bring more Catholic power into America, while the Catholics wanted to solidify the Church more into society. Protestant newspapers such as the Methodist Review warned its readers to beware of these canonizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kathleen|first1=Cummings|title=American Saints: Gender and the Re-Imaging of U.S. Catholicism in the Early Twentieth Century|journal=ProQuest|date=2012|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
The historian K. I. Koppedrayer has suggested that the Catholic Church fathers' [[hagiography]] of Tekakwitha reflected "some of the trials and rewards of the European presence in the New World."&lt;ref name=TheMaking /&gt; She captured the imagination of some observers. Based on accounts from two Jesuit priests who knew her, at least 300 books have been published in more than 20 languages on the life of Kateri Tekakwitha.&lt;ref name="Bonaparte"&gt;[http://www.wampumchronicles.com/alilyamongthornsspeech.html Darren Bonaparte (Mohawk), "A Lily Among Thorns: The Mohawk Repatriation of Káteri Tekahkwí:tha"], presented at 30th Conference on New York State History, 5 June 2009, Plattsburgh, New York, accessed 25 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Tekakwitha has been featured in late 20th-century novels and at least one 21st-century, which have explored the role of religion and colonialism in the New World:
*[[Leonard Cohen]], ''[[Beautiful Losers]]'' (1966);
*[[William T. Vollmann]], ''[[Fathers and Crows]]'' (1992), second novel of the ''Seven Dreams: A Book of North American Landscapes'' series, includes her as a character, together with French colonists and priests.
*[[Victor O'Connell]], ''[[Eaglechild]]'' (2016) a modern story in which a Spanish Countess travels to Quebec to ask the Saint to be the spiritual head of mother's council designed to raise her only child as part of her grand scheme to make restitution for the harm done to the aboriginal peoples of the Americas by her family and other colonists. A key scene in the plot of the novel takes place in the church at Khanawake and it raises issues about customary adoptions.

Novelist [[Diane Glancy]] (who is of Cherokee descent) was the first Native American writer to make Tekakwitha the main focus of an historical novel, ''The Reason for Crows''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunypress.edu/p-4821-the-reason-for-crows.aspx |title=The Reason for Crows |publisher=Sunypress.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an episode of French/Spanish animation series ''Clémentine'', the time-travelling main character Clémentine Dumant meets and befriends a younger version of Tekakwitha. She is portrayed as a shy teenage girl who is isolated and harassed by her peers after her conversion, but with Clémentine's help she earns their love and respect.

Brooklyn-based Irish singer / songwriter Niall Connolly includes a song titled "[https://niallconnolly.bandcamp.com/track/lily-of-the-mohawks Lily of the Mohwaks]" on his 2013 album, ''[http://niallconnolly.com/music/sound/ Sound]''. The song was inspired when he noticed an image of Kateri Tekakwitha on the door of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], New York City.

==Legacy==
[[File:Kateri Tekakwitha devotional medal.jpg|thumb|Blessed Kateri [[devotional medal]].]]
After Tekakwitha’s beatification in 1980, Paula E. Holmes in the late 1990s interviewed several different elderly Native American women about their childhood and hearing stories from their ancestors about Tekakwitha. One woman retold her time in a church where her grandmother told her that she prayed to Kateri for her, one semiretired nurse from New Mexico told Holmes about her aunt’s fondness of Kateri and how people would travel to New York to learn about her, and the nurse’s cousin told Holmes how her mother kept pictures of Kateri wrapped in fur and gave her a Tekakwitha medal. Holmes then stated that Kateri is "as part of their Indian familiar and familial heritage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holmes|first1=Paula|title=The Narrative Repatriation of Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha [Repatriation of Kateri Tekakwitha through Narratives, as Told by Her Pueblo Women Devotees]|journal=ProQuest|date=2001|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clarence A. Walworth|Father Clarence Walworth]] was one of the biggest pushers for Tekakwitha’s veneration. Because Walworth was so interested in Native American history, he researched Tekakwitha’s life and promoted her cause with his niece, [[Ellen Hardin Walworth|Ellen]]. He then personally financed a thousand dollar granite monument in Kahnawake out of a gesture for international co-operation for her veneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greer|first1=Allan|title=Natives and Nationalism: The Americanization of Kateri Tekakwitha|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=260–272 |date=2004|jstor=25026572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional fashion, numerous churches, schools and other Catholic institutions have been named for her, particularly since her canonization, including several Catholic elementary schools. Among these are St. Kateri Tekakwitha Catholic Elementary School in [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]],&lt;ref&gt;https://stkateri.wcdsb.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; Kateri Tekakwitha Catholic Elementary School in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://york.cioc.ca/record/MKM1867 |title=York Catholic District School Board, Kateri Tekakwitha Catholic Elementary School |publisher=York.cioc.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Kateri Tekakwitha Catholic Elementary School in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stkt.hwcdsb.ca/ |title=St. Kateri Tekakwitha Catholic Elementary School |publisher=Stkt.hwcdsb.ca |date=2017-01-10 |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Kateri Tekakwitha Catholic School in Orléans ([[Ottawa]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kat.ocsb.ca/ |title=St. Kateri Tekakwitha |publisher=Kat.ocsb.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and St. Kateri Tekakwitha School in [[Calgary]], Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cssd.ab.ca/schools/stkateri/Pages/default.aspx|title=St. Kateri Tekakwitha School|publisher=Calgary Catholic School District|accessdate=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Kateri is the patron saint of [[John Cabot Catholic Secondary School]] in [[Mississauga]].

The St. Kateri Tekakwitha School in [[Schenectady, New York]] was so named after her canonization. The St. Kateri Tekakwitha Parish, also located in Schenectady, was founded by merging the Our Lady of Fatima and St. Helen's churches in late 2012. A cluster parish was formed in [[Irondequoit, New York]] in 2010, taking the name Blessed Kateri Parish; later changing the name to Saint Kateri after her canonization. Kateri Residence, an Archdiocese of New York Catholic Charities nursing home in Manhattan, New York, is named for her.

The St. Kateri Tekakwitha Church in [[Valencia, California]], holds a statue of her in the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blessedkateriparish.org/ |title=Home |publisher=Blessedkateriparish.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nodeju.com/2950/us-has-new-native-american-saint.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518022639/http://www.nodeju.com/2950/us-has-new-native-american-saint.html |archivedate=May 18, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Saint Kateri Tekakwitha is placed at the steps of Holy Cross School at San Buenaventura Mission in southern California to honor the local Native American [[Chumash people]], who helped build and sustain the Mission until the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanbuenaventuramission.org/history/blessed-kateri-tekawitha |title=Saint Kateri Tekawitha |publisher=San Buenaventura Mission |date=2012-10-21 |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tekakwitha is featured at [[Camp Ondessonk]], a [[Catholic]] youth camp in [[southern Illinois]]. One of the cabin units is named after her. She is one of the namesakes of [[Camp Ondessonk|Camp Ondessonk's]] honor society, The Lodges of Ondessonk and Tekakwitha.

Each year since 1939 the [[Tekakwitha Conference]] meets annually in order to support Native Americans’ conversions into and practices of Catholicism. At each conference, people gather in Kateri Circles, named in honor of her, in order to pray together and help each other become better Catholics. In 1991, the Conference reported 130 registered Kateri Circles.&lt;ref name="Marquette U"/&gt;

The chapel of [[Welsh Family Hall (University of Notre Dame)|Welsh Family Hall]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]]  built in 1997, is dedicated to Kateri Tekakwitha.

{{Hindu philosophy}}

'''Lakshmi Kumara Thathachariar''' or '''Sri Lakshmi Kumara Thatha Desikan''' (Sanskrit): श्री लक्ष्मी कुमार ताता देसिकन, [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: ஸ்ரீ லக்ஷ்மி குமார தாத தேசிகன்) (1456–1543) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduonnet.com/2000/11/24/stories/13240901.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was a prominent [[Vaishnava]] saint and [[Guru]] in the [[Hindu]] tradition in [[Vaishnavism]], [[India]]. Sri Lakshmi Kumara Thatha Desikan was a devotee of Lord [[Narayana]] specially Lord [[Rama]] and the [[Vaishnava]] [[Guru]] /acharya Swamy [[Vedanta Desika]]. He has the title '''Kottikannikadhana Thirumalai Edur Immadi Royadurgam Sri Lakshmi Kumara Thatha Desikan'''. He was the Royal Preceptor "Raja Guru" of king of [[Vijayanagar Empire]] [[Krishnadevaraya]]. '''His full name was Lakshmi Kumara Tathacharya. He was a great enemy of [[Tenali Rama]] and also a great saint.''' He was the "Manager-General" of the [[Divya Desam]] Temples including [[Sri Rangam]], [[Kanchipuram]], [[Tirumala]], [[Melkote]], [[Srivilliputtur]], He is recorded as one of the greatest Aacharyas in the lineage of Sri [[Ramanuja]]'s [[Vaishnavism]].

Sri Thatha Desika was the adopted son of the famous Sri Pancha Madha Bandhana Thatha Desikan&lt;ref&gt;http://www.munitrayam.org/andavanashram/avv5.html&lt;/ref&gt; (his paternal uncle), a learned scholar and most revered aacharya of the Indian Philosophy and Sri [[Ramanujacharya]]'s "[[Visishtadvaita]]".

==Sri Thatha Desikan==

Taking the roots from Sri Satamarshana maharishi in Krutha Yuga [[Satya Yuga]], the first among the yugas, Sri Thatha Desikan hails from a very glorious acharya lineage with the hereditary relations from various Aacharyas of Sri Vaishnava philosophy like Sriman Natha Munigal ([[Nathamuni]]), Sri Alavandhar, Sri Thirumalai Nambigal (who is believed to be called by the Lord of Seven Hills, [[Tirumala]] [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupati]] Sri [[Venkateswara|Balaji]] as "Thathah:" the [[Sanskrit]] equivalent of the English Term "Holy Father"). Sri Thirumalai Nambigal being  the maternal uncle of Sri Ramanujacharya ([[Ramanuja]]) and the one who corrected Sri Govinda Bhattar alias 'Embar' the brother of Sri [[Ramanuja]] and a venerated saint of Sri Vaishnava Sampradhaya. Sri Thirukurugai Piran Pillan being the son of Sri Thirumalai Nambigal was appointed as the 'Sri Ubhaya Vedhanta Sri Bhashya Simhasanathipathi' - literally meaning the 'Divine Incharge' of the 'Sri Bhashya' ([[Sri Bhasya]]) the treatise to Sri [[Veda Vyasa]]'s "[[Brahma Sutras]]" written by Sri Ramanujacharya and the "Nalayira Dhivya Prabandham" (especially 'Thiruvaimozhi' of Sri [[Nammalvar]]) the collection of 4000 songs sung by [[Tamil people|Tamil]] Saints known as [[Alwars]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduonnet.com/2000/11/24/stories/13240901.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Greatness==

Sri Thatha Desikan traces his origin from the most celebrated aacharya purusha Swamy Nikamantha Maha Desikan ([[Vedanta Desika]]) of Thoopul. Sri Thatha Desikan comes in the chronology of 22nd Generation of Sriman Nathamunigal ([[Nathamuni]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduonnet.com/2000/11/24/stories/13240901.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to have got all the divine knowledge fed to him by the Divine Mother Goddess Sri Lakshmi Devi known as Sri Komalavalli, the consort of the presiding deity of Sri Sarangapani Temple in [[Kumbakonam]] in Tamil Nadu (India). Sri Thatha Desikan was the Raja Guru of the Venkatapathi Rayas I and II (known as Sriranga Raya) and was the chief minister of Sri [[Vijayanagar Empire]]. Prior to Thatha Desikan, His father Sri Sundara Thatha Desikan and Paternal Uncle Sri Pancha Madha Bandhana Thatha Desikan were adorning the courts of the Vijayanagar Kingdom as Raja Gurus or Divine Preceptors.

==History==

Sri Thatha Desikan during his regime brought a large army from Vijayanagar and drove away the unrighteous people from the Divya Desams of Sri Rangam, Kanchipuram, Srivilliputtur, Thirumalirum Cholai. Kumbakonam and many other places and restored the worships and conducts as directed by the greatest philosopher Sri Ramanujacharya and Swamy Sri Nikamantha Maha Desikan of Thoopul. Sri Thatha Deiskan appointed His Heirs in these places and gave a lot of grants to these Temple, to take special care on the Temple Proceedings. Sri Thatha Desikan gold plated the 'Moolavar Vimanam' (the pyramidal structure over the sanctum sanctorum) of Tirumala Tirupati, Kanchipuram and renovated the parts of Srirangam Temple constructions. He constructed the 100 pillared mandapa in Kanchipuram Sri Varadharaja Perumal Temple. He also renovated various Shrines of the said temple. Around 15 stone Tablets with inscriptions stating the same is available in the Alavandhar Thirumuttram (The Circum circle pathway around the Sri Varadharaja Perumal Temple Enclosure). A lot of historical evidence and archaeological proofs are available in various temples like Kanchipuram Temples, Tirumala Sri Venkateswara Temple, Sri Rangam, Srivilliputtur, and in many other places.

He guided the Kings of [[Vijayanagar Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/arts/magazine/article1072944.ece&lt;/ref&gt; in following the righteous path known as [[Dharma]]. He is the only person to hold the twin positions of [[Raja Guru]] and [[Chief Minister]] of the state. The contribution of Sri Thatha Desikan in protecting the cultural values of South India and Sri [[Vaishnavism]] could be traced from a lot of references available in the forts of the Kingdom like [[Chandragiri]]. During his lifetime Sri Thatha Desikan travelled all around ancient [[Bhārat Gaṇarājya|Bharath]] for the purpose of educating people from various cadres of the society to follow the codes of Righteousness. He is been referred by lot of philosophers and saints owing to various sampradhayas or walks of [[Hindu]] religion. The great contemporary writer and philosopher Sri Appaya Dikshitar of Adayapalam has referred and praised Thatha Desikan in many of his works. He considered Thatha Desikan to be the Divine Incarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genealogy.com/users/j/a/i/Tirumala-B-Jairam/FILE/0003text.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711082015/http://www.genealogy.com/users/j/a/i/Tirumala-B-Jairam/FILE/0003text.txt |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thatha Samudhram==
Sri Thatha Desikan constructed a temple in Ayyankar Kulam, a small village near Kanchipuram known to be as "Thatha Samuthram&amp;nbsp;– Sri Lakshmi Saras Sri Maruthi /Sri Sanjeevirayar Temple" for Sri [[Hanuman]] with a temple tank&lt;ref&gt;http://wikimapia.org/259798/Iyyengar-Kulam-Anchineyar-Temple&lt;/ref&gt; measuring more than 150 acres  known as "Thatha Samudhram" literally meaning "Sri Thatha Ocean". The presiding deity of Sri Varadharaja Perumal visits this temple once in a year during the festival named "Natabhavi Uthsavam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wherewasitshot.com/2010/11/18/sri-sanjeevi-rayar-temple-ayyangar-kulam-kanchipuram/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213031500/http://www.wherewasitshot.com/2010/11/18/sri-sanjeevi-rayar-temple-ayyangar-kulam-kanchipuram/ |archivedate=2011-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends say that, Sri Thatha Desikan was a very pious devotee of Lord Sri [[Rama]]. Once Sri Thatha Desikan was travelling with all the wealth he got as a reward for his knowledge and as a tribute from various kings .He was intended to offer them to the Lord of Kanchipuram Sri Varadharaja Perumal. On reaching the outskirts of Kanchi, it was late night. So Thatha Desikan decided to stay with his disciples at the place for a while and decided to continue the travel once the sun rises. So all the treasure was kept near a tree and Thatha Desikan along with his disciples fell asleep. On knowing the wealth assimilated there, a group of thieves came there to loot them. So without any one's knowledge they came there and started bundling all the resources available there without any one's notice. By then, immediately a crew of monkeys led by a senior monkey came there and started beating the thieves very badly and drove them away from the treasures. The monkeys started guarding the treasure. Thus the treasure, which was meant to be offered to the GOD, got saved from getting plundered. As a miracle, Thatha Desikan had a dream in which he was shown the entire happenings and was blessed with the Darshan of Sri [[Hanuman]]. Thatha Desikan realised that it was none other than lord [[Hanuman]] a sincere servant of Lord [[Rama]] came there in his rescue. So Thatha Desikan was very much moved in Joy and tears started flowing down from his eyes. He immediately woke up and saw the thieves who have fallen unconscious being beaten heavily and the treasure being guarded by a crew of monkeys. Thatha Desikan also found his treasures saved. He was overwhelmed in devotion and decided to spend a part of the saved sum in building a magnificent temple for Lord [[Hanuman]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.djibnet.com/photo/sri+sanjeevi+rayar+temple/sanjeevirayar-swamy-temple-3643387942.html&lt;/ref&gt; along with Sri [[Rama]], Sri [[Sita]], Sri [[Lakshmana]]. He also built a very big lake near the constructed temple and named it as 'Sri [[Lakshmi]] saras', that means the 'Pond of Goddess Lakshmi' who happened to be his mother of Divine Origin as the presiding Goddess of Kumbakonam by name Sri Komalavalli of Sri Sarangapani Temple fed him the Mother's milk and the presiding Goddess of Kanchipuram Sri Perundevi saved him throughout his life and was Herself a teacher of various Arts and Philosophies to him.

But later this lake was fondly called as "Sri Thatha Samudhram" in remembrance of this great Aacharya, as the Lake was appearing majestically  like an ocean running for about 150 acres in area. Even during the present days, this Temple stands to be the Biggest Temple dedicated to this form of Lord [[Hanuman]] known as "Sri Sanjeeviraya" built during the ancient times of [[India]]. Sri Thatha Desikan also composed a famous literary work called "Srimath Hanumath Vimsathi" in praise of this Lord [[Hanuman]], which are inscribed on stone tablets and are kept in the ''[[prakarams]]'' (the circle enclosure surrounding the main temple) by the then King of Vijayanagar Empire. Later the entire surroundings of this Temple came to be known as "Sri Thathayyangar Kulam" in the remembrance of Sri Thatha Desikan. This small hamlet of village with a very great historic importance is situated near to the present day [[Kanchipuram]].

==Contribution to literature==

Sri Thatha Desikan has composed a lot of literary works including "Sri Hanumath Vimsadhi", "Nikama Parimalam", "Sri Panduranga Mahathmiyam", "Sri Desika Prabandha Eedu" and many more in the languages of Sanskrit and Tamil. These works are preserved in the libraries of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams. The work "Sri Thatha Vimsathi" composed on the greatness of Sri Thatha Desikan clearly records various acts and deeds of this great scholar.

Sri Thatha Desikan has also composed various literary works to substantiate various philosophical truths of Sri [[Vaishnavism]]. His devoutness towards Sri [[Ramanujacharya]] and Swamy [[Vedanta Desikan]] could be very much traced from his works. He was a master of Sanskrit, Tamil, Prakrut Languages. The "Sri Desika Prabandha Eedu"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduonnet.com/2000/11/24/stories/13240901.htm&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a testimony for his mastering the Tamil Literary skills. This work stands as a guide to the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] works of Swamy [[Vedanta Desikan]].

==Philosophy==

Sri Thatha Desikan followed the Vadakalai sect of modern Vaishnavism and his thoughts were deeply rooted his works. He was a sincere follower of Swamy Sri Nikamantha Maha Desikan of Thoopul (Vedanta Desika) and followed his foot steps. He had Sri Rama with Sita, Lakshmana, Bharata, Satrugana and Hanuman as his personal deity and carried them in a golden box to all the places where ever he travelled. Sri Thatha Desikan was considered as an embodiment of Truth, Devotion, Supreme Knowledge and Literature. He was revered as an "Aacharya Mahanubhava" which is the "Greatest Teacher and Philosopher".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ramanuja.org/sv/bhakti/archives/may2001/0156.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Thatha Desikan abided to the codes of Vaishnavism and its philosophical values as drafted by the Lineage of Teachers starting from Nammalvar to Swamy Vedanta Desika. Even though Sri Vaishnavism has a broader perspective of having existence from time immemorial, the accountability in this Kali yoga as marked by the Hindu calendar starts with the teachings of Alwars who are the saint-people who are believed to be sent by Sriman Narayana the Supreme God-Head, to relieve the people of this materialistic world from the glitches of Maya, an equivalent term of 'illusion'. Sri Thatha Desikan was praised and celebrated not only for the great knowledge level of him, but also for being so simple and entirely proud-less, as a person who has done a variety of contributions to the religion of Hinduism&amp;nbsp;– Sri Vaishnavism and to the Sampradhaya (the way) shown by Vedanta Desika.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiadivine.org/audarya/sri-vaishnava-forum/167749-fw-ramanujamission-fw-brahmotsavam-navalpakkam-temple-desika-stothram-mp3-cd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Ramanujacharya's 'Vedaartha Sangraha', works of Swamy [[Vedanta Desika]] are capsuled in the works of Sri Thatha Desikan. The Key concepts of Sri Ramanujacharya's Vishistadvaita like: Tattva, Hita and Purushartha; The Upaya and Upeya; Chit, Achit, Eswara; the truth behind the concept of  Karya, Karana; are well explained in most of the works of Sri Thatha Desikan like "Nikama Parimalam, Lakshmi Niyudam, Panchagranthi Nipaharam, Sapthagranthi Nipaharam, and Satvika Brahmana Vidya Vilasa". It is praise worthy to note that, Sri Thatha Desikan wrote the explanatory text of "Sri Desika Prabandha Eedu" which falls under the title of "Eedu" works, that holds as a guide to the works of Swamy Vedanta Desika. Similar Eedu work is "Thiru Aarayira Padi"  (the holy 6000 verses) written by an Aacharya  'Swamy Thirukurugai Piran Pillan' as a guide for the work of [[Nammalvar]] known as '[[Thiruvaimozhi]]' in [[Nalayira Divya Prabandham]]. It is praise worthy to note that Sri Thatha Desikan comes in the paternal family lineage of 'Swamy Thirukurugai Piran Pillan' who is again considered to be the 'Abhimana Puthran' (equivalent term for adopted son) of Sri [[Ramanujacharya]].

Sri Thatha Desikan is revered as,

''Thasmai Dharma Swaroopaya, Nirmalodhara Keerthaye |
''Sri Lakshmi kumara Thathayarya Desikaya Namon Namah: ||''

This literally means "we salute the great Aacharya "Sri Thatha Desikan", who is the embodiment of the Righteousness [[Dharma]] and innumerable valor".

==Royal patronage==

Sri Thatha Desika was the royal preceptor of the Vijayanagar Empire and was revered with high respects and fame. He was the 'Raja Guru'&amp;nbsp;– 'The Royal Teacher' and the 'Chief Minister' of [[Krishnadevaraya]] . The Kings patronised the contributions of this legend and made Him the "Manager-General" known as "Sri Karya Thurantharar" of all the [[Divya Desam]] Temples existing in their Empire, which are the 108 temples offered to Hindu God-Head Vishnu in India, with the acharya having the base at [[Kanchipuram]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibiblio.org/sadagopan/acharyans/sd13.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Also Swamy Thatha Desikan inherited the office of "Sri Karyam" ( known colloquially as "Dharmakartha-ship") of [[Kanchipuram]], [[Sriperumbudur]] and [[Kumbakonam]] temples from his ancestors also he governed various other temples Vishu Temples of India along with his heir apparents and the other aacharyas belonging to this clan of "Thathacharya".

Also the family of "Thirumalai Nambi", maternal uncle of Sri [[Ramanujacharya]]) of [[Tirumala]] possessing the title of "Thathachariars" are the adherent followers of Sri [[Ramanuja]] and Swamy [[Vedanta Desika]] and served as the Raja Gurus (Divine Preceptors) of various Dynasties which ruled India during various periods. Sri Thatha Desikan's Paternal lineage were the Raja Gurus for the rulers of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] Empire including the dynasties of [[Saluva]], [[Tuluva]] and [[Sangama]]. Even the empires of [[Hoysala]] and [[Chalukya]] shows references to these great men with the title of "Thathacharya" being the important aacharya clan of their respective empires, who belong to the [[gothra]] of Sadamarshana Maharishi. After the fall of Vijayanagar Empire the descendants of Swamy Thatha Desikan continued to be the Royal Preceptors for the Nayaka rulers who were appointed as the Governors of various Vijayanagar Empire territories including Vilankuppam, [[Kanchipuram]], [[Trichy]], [[Madurai]], [[Chandragiri]] and parts of modern days [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]].

==Humanitarianism==

The Love of this great Aacharya for the poor and suffering was well known by the excellent generous contributions that He made to bring them up in their lives. He established a lot of "Anna Chatrams"&amp;nbsp;– "Feeding Halls" and established the so-called "Desanthri Kattalai" the "Order to serve Travelers" in various Temples to feed the devotees visiting those temples daily. He sponsored the wedding of a lot of needy couples and hence adorned with the Honorary Title "Koti Kannikadhana" that reveres Him to have helped almost ten million couples or literally couples in a large crowd known as "Koshti"!&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiadivine.org/audarya/sri-vaishnava-forum/167749-fw-ramanujamission-fw-brahmotsavam-navalpakkam-temple-desika-stothram-mp3-cd.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was praised as "Ubhaya Vedantha Chariyar", meaning "The master of both Sanskrit Sacred Texts&amp;nbsp;– Vedas and Upanishads and Tamil works of Alwars known as Prabandhas"

==Descendants==

Even today the Descendants&lt;ref&gt;http://pvkalathur.blogspot.com/2007/08/as-holy-as-tirumala-nestling-in-obscure.html&lt;/ref&gt; of Sri Koti Kannikadhana Sri Lakshmi Kumara Thatha Desikan are living in various Divya Desams as the teachers of the Philosophical values and rich Indian Culture and are continuing many righteous deeds that are bound for them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.munithraya.web.officelive.com/{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thathacharyas are the custodians of the Kanchipuram Perarulalan Kovil popularly known as Varadaraja Perumal temple. They are the Pradhana Acharya Purushas in the protocol to receive and deliver the temple honors. In retrospection Tirumalai Nambi's son Tirukkurukai Piran Pillan was ordained by Ramanuja himself as the first and foremost among the 74 Peetadhipathis to propagate Visishtadwaita philosophy after him. Pillan was also chosen by Ramanuja as the competent person to write the commentary on "Tiruvaimozhi''. ''The annotation of Tiruvaimozhi thus brought out by Pillan under the behest of Ramanuja is called the famous 'Araiyarpadi' the first gloss in Manipravala, an elegant mixture of Tamil and Sanskrit words, on the Divya Prabhandam. After Pillan, Tirumalai Srinivasacharya Thathachariar in the fifth generation of Thathacharyas was installed by [[Vedanta Desika]] as the Sri Kariyam of the Devaraja Swamy Kovil (Sri [[Varadharaja Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram|Varadharaja Perumal Temple]] of [[Kanchipuram]]). Since then the office of Sri Kariyam is institutionalized in the diligence and devotion of the Thathacharyas to the Varadaraja Perumal temple in Kanchipuram. Lakshmi Kumara Thatha Desikan inherited this mantle from his ancestors and made epoch making contributions to the temple annals. He was the Sri Kariya Durandhara&amp;nbsp;– a phrase connoting absolute dedication and authority&amp;nbsp;– of the temple affairs. Simultaneously he was also the Raja Guru of the Vijayanagar king Venkatapathi Deva Maharaj. In Ayengarkulam, a village named after him near Kanchipuram, he built a tank and temple to Sri Rama and Hanuman.

==During modern days==

In the city of modern Kanchipuram , the Sri Varadharaja Perumal Temple's Sri Vedantha Desikan Sannidhi houses a six-feet idol of Sri Lakshmikumara Thatha Desikan along with His consort Sri Kamala Ammangar paying their homage to their aacharya Sri Swamy Nikamantha Maha Desikan. Whenever the presiding deity of Sri Varadharaja Perumal starts for procession,&lt;ref&gt;http://picasaweb.google.com/raghavanvee/THATHADESIKANUTSAVAM#{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the respect to these Aacharyas&amp;nbsp;– Swamy Sri Nikamantha Maha Desikan and Swamy Sri Lakshmi Kumara Thatha Desikan are offered the "Satari"&amp;nbsp;– the religious crown shaped structure with the imprints of the Lotus Feet of the Lord Vishnu in it, with the "Theertham"&amp;nbsp;– sacred water and the Garland "Malai" "Mariyadhai"&amp;nbsp;– "Respect". Sri Varadharaja Perumal Temple also houses the processional deity of Sri Lakshmi Kumara Thathadesikan.

[[File:Lao Tzu - Project Gutenberg eText 15250.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Laozi]], one of the most important gods in Lingbao Daoism]]
The '''Lingbao School''' (Simplified Chinese: 灵宝派; Traditional Chinese: 靈寶派; pinyin: Líng Bǎo Pài), also known as the '''School of the Sacred Jewel''' or the '''School of Numinous Treasure''', was an important [[Taoism|Daoist]] school that emerged in [[China]] in between the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] and the [[Liu Song Dynasty]] in the early fifth century CE. It lasted for about two hundred years until it was absorbed into the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi]] currents during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. The Lingbao School is a synthesis of religious ideas based on Shangqing texts, the rituals of the [[Tianshi Dao|Celestial Masters]], and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practices.

The Lingbao School borrowed many concepts from [[Buddhism]], including the concept of [[reincarnation]], and also some cosmological elements. Although reincarnation was an important concept in the Lingbao School, the earlier Daoist belief in attaining immortality remained. The school's pantheon is similar to Shangqing and Celestial Master Daoism, with one of its most important gods being the [[Apotheosis|deified]] form of [[Laozi]]. Other gods also existed, some of whom were in charge of preparing spirits for reincarnation. Lingbao ritual was initially in individual practice, but later went through a transformation that put more emphasis on collective [[rite]]s. The most important scripture in the Lingbao School is known as the ''Five Talismans'' (''Wufujing''), which was compiled by [[Ge Chaofu]] and based on [[Ge Hong]]'s earlier alchemical works.

Although Lingbao no longer exists as a distinct movement, it has left influences on all subsequent branches of Taoism. The "''yinyang'' masters" popular in contemporary [[northern China]] are defined as Zhengyi [[Taoist priest]]s following the Lingbao scriptural tradition.&lt;ref name="Jones, 5"&gt;Jones (2005), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Lingbao School began in around 400 CE when the Lingbao scriptures were revealed to [[Ge Chaofu]], the grandnephew of [[Ge Hong]]. Ge Chaofu claimed that the scriptures came to him in a line of transmission going back to Ge Hong's great-uncle, [[Ge Xuan]] (164-244).&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (1997), 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Ge Chaofu transmitted the scriptures to two of his disciples, and the scriptures quickly gained immense popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (1997), 377.&lt;/ref&gt; In 471, Lu Xiujing (406-477) compiled a catalogue of all the Lingbao texts, and also was responsible for reorganizing and standardizing Lingbao ritual. This organization of texts and ritual provided a solid foundation on which the Lingbao School prospered in the subsequent centuries.&lt;ref name="Yamada 2000, 232"&gt;Yamada (2000), 232.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Tang Dynasty, the influence of the Lingbao School declined and another school of Daoism, the Shangqing School, became prominent. Borrowing many Lingbao practices, it was well accepted by the aristocracy and established an influence in court.&lt;ref name="Fowler 2005, 151"&gt;Fowler (2005), 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Some early Lingbao scriptures borrowed so many Buddhist terminological, stylistic and conceptual elements that Zürcher describes them as "Buddho-Taoist hybrids".&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (1980), 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebirth===
[[File:Lingbao Talisman.gif|thumb|upright|right|A Daoist [[amulet|talisman]] from the Lingbao scriptures]]
Many Lingbao beliefs are borrowed from [[Buddhism]]. The names of the many different deities and heavens were often given titles based on phonetic transcriptions of [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (1980), 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Sanskrit terms were borrowed phonetically, but given completely different meanings. One significant concept borrowed from Buddhism was that of [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, 153"&gt;Robinet (1997), 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Buddhism and the Lingbao School share the idea of the [[Reincarnation|Five Paths of Rebirth]] (Gati). People were reborn into [[Naraka-gati|earth prisons]], as a [[Preta|hungry ghost]], as an [[Tiragyoni-gati|animal]], as a [[Human beings in Buddhism|man]], or as a [[Deva (Buddhism)|celestial being]].&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (1989), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; After death, the body would be alchemically refined in the Palace of Supreme Darkness located in the north, and the Southern Palace in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (1989), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The transmutation of the body consisted of two steps; the ''[[Yin and yang|yin]]'' components of the person were refined in the Palace of Supreme Darkness, followed by the ''[[Yin and yang|yang]]'' components in the Southern Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (1989), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lingbao concept of rebirth is a Chinese adaptation of Buddhism, mixing traditional Chinese concepts with newly arrived Buddhist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (1989), 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===
Lingbao [[cosmology]] also borrows heavily from [[Buddhism]]. Unlike previous Daoist cosmological systems which were divided into four to nine regions, Lingbao cosmology supposed that there were ten regions, an idea borrowed from Buddhism. In addition to the cosmological regions, there were 32 heavens divided into four sectors, each with eight heavens that were placed horizontally on the periphery of the celestial disc. Each of the four sectors was ruled by an emperor and populated by denizens of an earlier cosmic age (''[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]''). Like Buddhism, the heavens were divided into the "three worlds" of desire, form, and formlessness.&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, 158-159"&gt;Robinet (1997), 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; Lingbao cosmology deviated from Buddhist beliefs by proposing that the heavens rotated around a huge mountain known as the Jade Capital, which was the residence of the Celestial Worthy, the Daoist version of the Buddha, and the primordial deity.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (2008), 666.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (1997), 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain traditional Daoist ideas were retained in Lingbao cosmology, such as the idea that the world originated from a type of primordial ''[[qi]]'' known as ''[[yuan qi|yuanqi]]'', and then was divided into heaven and earth. Furthermore, the ''yuanqi'' is subdivided into three types of ''qi'' that correspond to three deities: the lords of the Celestial Treasure, of the Sacred Treasure and of the Divine Treasure. These three deities later introduced the teachings of the ''Dongzhen'' (Perfect Grotto), the ''Dongxuan'' (Mysterious Grotto), and of the ''Dongshen'' (Divine Grotto). These three teachings form the basis for the later classification of texts in the [[Daozang]].&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, 159"&gt;Robinet (1997), 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apocalypse|Apocalyptic]] notions that appeared in [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] Daoism were first developed fully by the Lingbao School. Lingbao cosmology supposed that time was divided into cosmic cycles, which correlated with the [[Five phases|Five Phases]]. At the end of a cosmic era, the god of the colour associated with that era would descend onto earth and reveal a teaching that would save a fixed number of people from death. There were two types of cosmic eras, short ones that were characterized by an excess of ''[[Yin and yang|yin]]'' energy, and long ones that were characterized by an excess of ''[[Yin and yang|yang]]'' energy. At the end of a short cosmic era, the moon was prophesied to produce a flood that would erode the mountains, renew the ''qi'' of the universe, and change the rankings of the members of the celestial bureaucracy. At the end of a long cosmic era, evil creatures were unleashed, heaven and earth were turned upside down, and metals and stones melted together. The people who followed the correct teaching revealed by the god of the colour would be gathered up by the [[Queen Mother of the West]] and transported to a "land of bliss" that would not be affected by the apocalypse.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pantheon===
In addition to borrowing deities from the [[Tianshi Dao|Celestial Masters]] and the Shangqing School, the Lingbao School also developed its own gods. The supreme god of Lingbao Daoists is known as the Yuanshi Tianzun or the Celestial Worthy of the Original Beginning, who played a similar role to the deified [[Laozi]] in the Celestial Masters. According to the scriptures, this god went through a series of ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]'' cycles that were given names similar to dynastic names, until emerging at the beginning of the ''Kaihuang'' period. The next most important god was Laojun, the deified form of [[Laozi]], who was the Celestial Worthy's chief disciple.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (1997), 381.&lt;/ref&gt; Below these two main gods in the celestial hierarchy were those deities associated with the Southern Palace, where spirits went after death to prepare for rebirth. The head of this group of gods was known as the Perfected of the Southern Extremities. Beneath him was the Director of the Equerry, who was in charge of the life records of the spirits, and Lord Han, who controlled [[Fengdu]], the city of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (1997), 382.&lt;/ref&gt; Below these principal gods in the Lingbao hierarchy were other deities such as the Five Old Men, the [[Dragon Kings]], and the Demon Kings.&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, 158"&gt;Robinet (1997), 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deities were present not only in the heavens, but also in the human body itself. They were responsible for maintaining the body's [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five viscera]], guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the [[liver]] and [[lungs]]. The Director of Destinies lived in the [[heart]] and [[sexual organs]], and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower [[dantian]]. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (1997), 384-385.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a belief in reincarnation, the Lingbao School maintained the traditional Daoist idea that certain techniques could allow an adherent to achieve immortality. One technique was to ingest the essence of the sun and the moon. Practitioners would expose themselves to the celestial bodies at certain times of the month.  Closing their eyes, they would visualize that the essences would solidify and enter their bodies. Once in the body, the sun's essence was matched to the heart and visualized as red, while the moon's was matched with the kidneys and seen as black. Besides interior meditation practices, immortality could be achieved through the ingestion of potions or [[Amulet|talismans]].&lt;ref&gt;Yamada (2000), 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rituals===
Early Lingbao [[ritual]] was mostly done on an individual basis, either in a meditation chamber, or the courtyard of a house. Early practitioners were not professional priests, but rather 'students of the Dao'. Later on, as the Lingbao movement developed religious institutions and an established clergy, ritual practice became more of a communal rite.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (1997), 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lingbao ritual shares a great deal with ritual in other Daoist traditions. Like other traditions, Lingbao rituals had a theatrical quality that involved accompanying music, dances, and [[chant]]s. Lingbao Daoism also shared the multidimensional aspect of Daoist ritual, meaning that it was carried on at several different levels simultaneously. For example, while a ritual was being performed, the priest would repeat the ritual within himself through interior [[meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three categories of ritual in Lingbao Daoism. The first is known as the heavenly Golden Register of Rituals, and is carried out to prevent natural disasters. During the [[Tang Dynasty]], this ritual was carried out in honour of the imperial family, but later it could be performed by anyone. The earthly Yellow Register ritual was performed to ensure the dead was at rest. The final type of ritual, which has not survived, was the human Jade Register, which was performed to ensure the salvation of mankind. Of the rituals that have survived, the Golden Register has assumed the role of the Jade register, ensuring salvation and preventing bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canon==
{{See also|List of Lingbao Texts}}
[[File:Baopuzi.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A page from the ''[[Baopuzi]]'', on which the Lingbao scriptures are based]]
Lingbao scriptures arose as a direct result of the success of earlier Shangqing texts. Lingbao scriptures are all based on a text known as the ''Text of the Five Talismans'' (''Wufujing''), which was compiled by [[Ge Chaofu]] between 397 and 402 and borrowed from the work of [[Ge Hong]], his great uncle. Being the most ancient Lingbao text, the ''Five Talismans'' provided the framework of the remainder of the Lingbao canon, which was based on the [[Cardinal direction|five directions]]. Because all Lingbao texts descended from the ''Five Talismans'', it was believed that they had been revealed to Ge Xuan, presumably the original owner of the ''Five Talismans''. Ge Xuan is purported to have transmitted the Lingbao texts first to his disciple Zheng Siyuan, who then transmitted it to Ge's grandnephew [[Ge Hong]] (284-364), who is well known for his alchemical innovations. The claim that the Lingbao texts derive from Ge Xuan, however, was likely a way of legitimizing them through the exaggeration of their antiquity. In reality, they were likely assembled by [[Ge Chaofu]] himself. Within a few years of the texts' dissemination, they had become extremely popular.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

The canon itself is a mix of previous Daoist traditions, combining features from the Shangqing School and the Celestial Masters, along with other ancient texts and even some Buddhist ideas. The two most important texts of the canon besides the ''Wufujing'' are the ''Red Book of Five Writings'' (''Chi shu wupian'') and the ''Scripture of Upper Chapters on Limitless Salvation'' (''Wuliang Duren Shangpin'').&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), 151.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lu Xiujing, who edited the Lingbao Canon, there were a total of 34 texts in the canon, of which three have been lost.&lt;ref name="Yamada 2000, 232"/&gt;

==Legacy==
While the Lingbao school did not survive as a distinct entity, its ritual apparatus did, and it forms the basis for present-day Daoist ritual practice.&lt;ref name="Fowler 2005, 151"/&gt; In addition, many of the innovations introduced by the Lingbao School have survived to the present, including its division of the Daozang into three sections corresponding to different teachings, with the ''Dongzhen'' corresponding to the Shangqing School, the ''Dongxuan'' to the Lingbao School, and the ''Dongshen'' to the Sanhuang teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (2001), 181-182.&lt;/ref&gt; The integration of Buddhism within Lingbao practices and beliefs ensured that Buddhist elements would remain an important aspect of later Daoism, and also aided in integrating Buddhism into all levels of society in China.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (2008), 663-664.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}
'''Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War''' is the name given by the [[Catholic Church]] to the people who were [[Red Terror (Spain)|killed by Republicans during the war]] because of their faith.&lt;ref name="Butler's Lives of the Saints"&gt;Butler, Alban and Peter Doyle [https://books.google.com/books?id=PBGzh1JK2gUC&amp;pg=PA169 Butler's Lives of the Saints] p. 169 Liturgical Press (February 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; More than 6,800 clergy and religious were killed in this "Red Terror". As of November 2018, 1,891 Spanish martyrs have been beatified; 11 of them being Canonized. For some two thousand additional martyrs, the beatification process is underway.

==History==
During the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–1939, and especially in the early months of the conflict, individual clergymen were executed while entire religious communities were persecuted, leading to a death toll of 13 bishops, 4,172 diocesan priests and seminarians, 2,364 monks and friars and 283 nuns, for a total of 6,832 clerical victims, as part of what is referred to as [[Spain]]'s [[Red Terror (Spain)|Red Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;Julio de la Cueva, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/261121 "Religious Persecution, Anticlerical Tradition and Revolution: On Atrocities against the Clergy during the Spanish Civil War"] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 33.3 (July 1998): 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pope John Paul II===
{{See also|233 Spanish Martyrs}}
[[Pope John Paul II]] beatified a total of about 500 martyrs in the years 1987, 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1995,  1997 and 2001. Some  [[233 Spanish Martyrs|233 executed clergy were beatified]] by John Paul II on 11 March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/NWEVNGST.HTM ''New Evangelization with the Saints''], [[L'Osservatore Romano]] 28 November 2001, page 3 (Weekly English Edition)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 he also canonized [[Jaime Hilario Barbal|a Christian Brother]] and the nine [[Martyrs of Turon]], the first group of Spanish Civil War martyrs to reach sainthood. Regarding the  selection of Candidates, Archbishop ''Edward Novack'' from the ''Congregation of Saints'' explained  in an interview with ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'': "Ideologies such as Nazism or Communism serve as a context of martyrdom, but in the foreground the person stands out with his conduct, and, case by case, it is important that the people among whom the person lived should affirm and recognize his fame as a martyr and then pray to him, obtaining graces. It is not so much ideologies that concern us, as the sense of faith of the People of God, who judge  the person's behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/NWEVNGST.HTM|title=NEW EVANGELIZATION WITH THE SAINTS|website=www.ewtn.com|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pope Benedict XVI===
{{See also|498 Spanish Martyrs}}

[[Benedict XVI]] beatified 498 more Spanish martyrs in October 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azstarnet.com/allheadlines/187121 |title=Tucson priests one step away from sainthood |work=[[Arizona Star]] |date=2007-06-12 |accessdate=6 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203144806/http://www.azstarnet.com/allheadlines/187121 |archivedate=3 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the largest beatification ceremony in the history of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="ICN"&gt;[http://www.indcatholicnews.com/spanima436.html 500 Spanish martyrs to be beatified] [[Independent Catholic News]] 10 October 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012040124/http://www.indcatholicnews.com/spanima436.html |date=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this group of people,  the Vatican has not included ''all'' Spanish  martyrs, nor any of the 16 priests who were executed by the nationalist side in the first years of the war. This decision has caused numerous criticisms from surviving family members and several political organisations in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;"''Familiares de los curas vascos fusilados por Franco claman contra el olvido''"[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/somos/nadie/elpepusoc/20071027elpepisoc_13/Tes] On-line edition of [[El País]] 27 October 2007(in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

The beatification recognized the extraordinary fate and often brutal death of the persons involved. Some have criticized the beatifications as dishonoring non-clergy who were also killed in the war, and as being an attempt to draw attention away from the church's support of Franco (some quarters of the Church called the Nationalist cause a "crusade").&lt;ref&gt;"Vatican's Plan to Beatify Spanish Clergy Divisive" by [[Jerome Socolovsky]].  Morning Edition, National Public Radio, 13 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within Spain, the Civil War still raises high emotions. The act of beatification has also coincided in time with the debate on the [[Law of Historical Memory]] (about the treatment of the victims of the war and its aftermath) promoted by the Spanish Government.

Responding to the criticism, the Vatican has described the  October 2007 beatifications as relating to personal virtues and holiness, not ideology. They are  not about "resentment but&amp;nbsp;... reconciliation".  The Spanish government has supported the beatifications, sending Foreign Minister [[Miguel Ángel Moratinos]] to attend the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24515567|title=Spain civil war 'martyrs' beatified|date=13 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among those present was [[Juan Andrés Torres Mora]], a relative of one of the martyrs and the Spanish MP who had debated the memory law for PSOE

The October 2007 beatifications have brought the number of martyred persons beatified by the Church to 977, eleven of whom have been canonized as saints.&lt;ref name="ICN"/&gt; Because of the extent of the persecution, many more cases could be proposed; as many as 10,000 according to Catholic Church sources. The process for beatification has already been initiated for about 2,000 people.&lt;ref name="ICN"/&gt;

At 28 October 2007 beatifications, Pope Benedict underscored the call to sanctity for all Christians, saying it was "realistic possibility for the entire Christian people".&lt;ref name="latimes2007"&gt;WINFIELD, NICOLE [http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/wire/sns-ap-vatican-spain-beatifications,1,1155789.story?coll=sns-ap-world-headlines Vatican Beatifies 498 Spanish Martyrs] Los Angeles Times (AP) 28 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  He also noted, "This martyrdom in ordinary life is an important witness in today's secularized society." &lt;ref name="latimes2007"/&gt;

===Pope Francis===
{{See also|522 Spanish Martyrs}}
[[Pope Francis]] beatified 522 martyrs on 13 October 2013, at [[Tarragona]], [[Spain]]; among them was [[Eugenio Sanz-Orozco Mortera]] from [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], who became the first [[Filipino people|Filipino]] martyr of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He also approved additional beatifications for Spanish martyrs that took place for a priest on 1 November 2014 as well as two sets of group martyrs on both 5 September 2015 and 3 October 2015.

===Martyrs of Turon===
{{main|Martyrs of Turon}}
The martyrs of Turon were a group of eight De La Salle Brothers, and the Passionist priest who was with them, who were executed by striking miners at Turon in October 1934. Although this was nearly two years before the outbreak of the civil war, their deaths were part of the same violence and anti-clerical feeling of that period in Spain's history, and are regarded as martyrs of the Spanish Civil War. They were beatified by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 29 April 1990, and were canonized by him on 21 November 1999.

===Saint Innocencio of Mary Immaculate===
{{main|Innocencio of Mary Immaculate}}
Saint [[Innocencio of Mary Immaculate]], born Emanuele Canoura Arnau, was a member of the [[Passionist]] Congregation and martyr of the [[Spanish Civil War]], born on 10 March 1887 in Santa Cecelia del Valle de Oro in Galicia, [[Spain]]; He died at Turon, with his eight companions, on 9 October 1934. He was beatified on 29 April 1990 and was canonized by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 21 November 1999.

===Saint Jaime Hilario Barbal===
{{main|Jaime Hilario Barbal}}
Jaime Hilario Barbal, born Manuel Barbal Cosán, was raised in a pious and hardworking family near the Pyrenees mountains. Entered the seminary at age 12, but when his hearing began to fail in his teens, he was sent home. Joined the Brothers of the Christian Schools at age 19, entering the novitiate on 24 February 1917 at Irun, Spain, taking the name Jaime Hilario. Exceptional teacher and catechist, he believed strongly in the value of universal education, especially for the poor. However, his hearing problems grew worse, and in the early 1930s, he was forced to retire from teaching, and began work in the garden at the La Salle house at San Jose, Tarragona, Spain. Imprisoned in July 1936 at Mollerosa, Spain when the Spanish Civil War broke out and religious were swept from the street. Transferred to Tarragona in December, then confined on a prison ship with some other religious. Convicted on 15 January 1937 of being a Christian Brother. Two rounds of volley fire from a firing squad did not kill him, possibly because some of soldiers intentionally shot wide; their commander then murdered Jaime with five shots at close range. First of the 97 La Salle Brothers killed in Catalonia, Spain during the Spanish Civil War to be recognized as a martyr. He was beatified on 29 April 1990, and was canonized by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 21 November 1999.

They  were a group of priests and brothers of the [[Passionist]] Congregation killed by Republican forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. They were [[beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 1 October 1989.  Eyewitnesses reported that all of the Passionists had forgiven their murderers before they died. A witness to the murder of Father Niceforo reported that after being shot the priest turned his eyes to heaven then turned and smiled at his murderers. At this point one of them, now more infuriated than ever, shouted:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;What, are you still smiling?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passiochristi.org/Documents/Santi%20Passionisti/SantiCP_Blessed%20Passionist%20martyrs%20of%20Daimiel.htm Father Pablo García, C.P., Blessed Niceforo and Companions, Martyrs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015042321/http://www.passiochristi.org/Documents/Santi%20Passionisti/SantiCP_Blessed%20Passionist%20martyrs%20of%20Daimiel.htm |date=15 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
During the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, the Catholic Church in the Spain supported and was strongly supported by and associated with the Spanish monarchy. The [[Second Spanish Republic]] saw an alternation of leftist and conservative coalition governments between 1931 and 1936. Amidst the disorder caused by the military coup of July 1936, many supporters of the Republican government pointed their weapons against individuals they considered local reactionaries, including priests and nuns.

A paradoxic case for foreign Catholics was that of the [[Basque Nationalist Party]], at the time a Catholic party from the Basque areas, who after some hesitation, supported the Republican government in exchange for [[Basque Government|an autonomous government]] in the Basque Country.  Although, virtually every other group on the Republican side was involved in the [[anticlerical]] persecution, the Basques did not play a part.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''[http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne26.htm A History of Spain and Portugal]'' Vol. 2 (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1973), 649.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Vatican diplomacy tried to orient them to the National side, explicitly supported by Cardinal [[Isidro Goma y Tomas]], but the BNP feared the centralism of the Nationals. Some [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]] also found themselves in the same situation, such as members of de [[Unió Democràtica de Catalunya]] party whose most relevant leader, [[Manuel Carrasco i Formiguera]] was killed by the ''Nationalists'' in [[Burgos]] in 1938.

==Controversy==
A number of controversies have arisen around the beatification of some of these clerics. Some objectors oppose the notion of these priests being killed for mere religious hatred and, while not excusing their brutal murders, putting them in the context of the historical moment. Others question the appropriateness of beatification for some individuals who have less than saintly backgrounds. A third objection is the perceived partiality of the Church, where victims of the left have been proposed for beatification, while victims of the right have been ignored.

Of the first objection, one of the most notable cases has centered on Cruz Laplana y Laguna, [[Bishop of Cuenca]], a well-known supporter of the monarchist regime. After the proclamation of the Second Republic he carried out a number of right-wing political campaigns throughout the province, and had established close contacts with military officials such as General [[Joaquín Fanjul]], a supporter of the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] rebellion. Laplana y Laguna was described by his biographer as "supreme advisor" to the general, as well as being closely involved with the [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista|Falange]]. In 1936 he personally endorsed Falangista leader [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]] as a candidate in the 1936 local elections. When the Nationalist uprising in Cuenca failed, Laplana y Lagun was arrested by Republican militiamen for treason. He was tried for conspiring against the Republican government and executed on 8 August.&lt;ref&gt;Pardo Lancina, Víctor. [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/obispo/combatiente/elpepusoc/20071029elpepisoc_6/Tes ''El obispo combatiente''] '' El País'', 29 October 2007 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another is Fulgencio Martínez, a priest in the village of La Paca in [[Murcia]], who was shot after the uprising, who was reported by many locals to be closely allied to the local landowners. Over several days before the uprising, Father Fulgencio met with these landowners in the village casino&amp;mdash;the hub of social life for the local elites in rural Spain&amp;mdash;to organize support for the rebellion. He offered guns and money to anyone who would join an improvised militia. On 18 July, the day of the uprising, Father Fulgencio was among the persons who went through the village streets on lorries, rallying support for the uprising with shouts of ''"Viva el Ejército!"'' ("Long live the Army") and ''"Viva [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano|General Queipo de Llano]]!"''&lt;ref name="iu-regiondemurcia1"&gt;Dimas, Floren. [http://www.iu-regiondemurcia.es/fichamem.asp?id=19&amp;idp=29&amp;t=2 Letter from the President of the Association for Historical Memory to the Editor of LA VERDAD DE MURCIA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Public statements by some of these clerics have also been widely publicised as a form of criticism against their beatification. Rigoberto Domenech, [[Archbishop of Zaragoza]], declared publicly on 11 August 1936 that the military uprising was to be supported, and its defensive actions approved, because "it is not done in the service of anarchy, but in the benefit of order, fatherland, and religion" in response to the [[Red Terror (Spain)|Red Terror]]. Another statement was that given in November 1938 by Leopoldo Eijo Garay, Bishop of Madrid-Alcalá, regarding a possible truce between Republican and rebel forces: "To tolerate democratic liberalism... would be to betray the martyrs."&lt;ref&gt;Casanova, Julián. [http://blogs.20minutos.es/martinezsoler/post/2006/06/14/guerra-y-religion-ano-recuerdo-y-conmemoracion "''Guerra Civil y Religión''"] ''El País'', 14 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the second, the controversy surrounding the beatification of [[Augustinian]] Friar [[Gabino Olaso Zabala]], listed as a companion of Avelino Rodriguez Alonso, concerns his previous life. Friar Zabala was martyred during the Civil War and was beatified. Attention was called to the fact that Fr. Olaso had been a missionary in the Philippines during the [[Katipunan]] rebellion against Spanish rule, and had been accused of torturing Friar Mariano Dacanay, an alleged rebel sympathizer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/291892/0/benedicto/beatificacion/torturador/ ''Uno de los mártires de la Guerra Civil que el Papa beatificará fue un torturador'']  ''20minutos'' 17 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However this objection ignores the Church proclamation that even sinners can [[Repentance (Christianity)|repent]] and turn into saints, such as in the case of [[Augustine of Hippo]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. It also misunderstands the nature of a cause for martyrdom, where the primary factor is the person's death due to religious hatred of the faith, rather than the saintliness of his previous life.

The third objection refers to the Church's attitude to victims of [[White Terror (Spain)|Nationalist repression]]. Regarding the attitude of the Vatican, [[Manuel Montero]], lecturer of the [[University of the Basque Country]] commented on 6 May 2007:

{{quote|The Church, which upheld the idea of a 'National [[Crusade]]' in order to legitimize the military rebellion, was a belligerent part during the Civil War, even at the cost of alienating part of its members. It continues in a belligerent role in its unusual answer to the [[Historical Memory Law]] by recurring to the beatification of 498 "martyrs" of the Civil War. The priests executed by Franco's Army are not counted among them... Its selective criteria regarding the religious persons that were part of its ranks are difficult to fathom. The priests who were victims of the republicans are "martyrs who died forgiving", but those priests who were executed by the Francoists are forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Montero. [http://www.almendron.com/tribuna/?p=15373 ''"Otros 'mártires' de la Guerra Civil"''] ''El País'', 6/5/2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While much of Republican Spain was anti-clerical in sentiment, the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque region]], which also supported the Republic, was not; the clergy of the region stood against the Nationalist coup, and suffered accordingly. At least 16 Basque nationalist priests (among them the arch-priest of [[Mondragon, Spain|Mondragón]]) were killed by the Nationalists,&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain; The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939''. Penguin Books. 2006. London. pp.82-83&lt;/ref&gt; and hundreds more were imprisoned or deported.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. 2001. London. p.677&lt;/ref&gt; This included several priests who tried to halt the killings.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. 2001. London. pp.251-252&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the Vatican has failed to consider these clergy as martyrs of the Spanish Civil War.

'''{{Lang|de|Mischling}}''' ("[[mixed-blood]]" in German, plural: {{Lang|de|Mischlinge}}) was the German legal term used in [[Nazi Germany]] to denote persons deemed to have both "[[Aryan]]" and [[Jews|Jewish ancestry]].&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;''Holocaust Encyclopedia'' p. 420-25. See also article on [[Eugen Fischer]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic root is cousin to the Latin term whence the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term ''[[mestizo]]'' and [[French language|French]] term ''[[métis]]'' originate.

In German, the word has the general denotation of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]], [[mongrel]], or [[half-breed]].&lt;ref&gt;Messinger, Heinz. ''Langenscheidts Handwörterbuch Englisch'', 2 parts, Teil II: Deutsch-English. Berlin (West) et al.: Langenscheidt, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; Outside its use in official [[Nazi terminology]], the term ''[[Mischlingskinder]]'' ("mixed children") was later used to refer to [[war babies]] born to [[non-white]] soldiers and German mothers in the [[aftermath of World War II]].

==Nuremberg laws==
[[File:Nurembergracechart.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The diagram shows the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] racial division, according to the Nuremberg Laws, which was the basis of the racial policies of Nazi Germany. Only people with four German grandparents (four white circles – leftmost column) were considered to be "full-blooded" Germans. German nationals with three or four Jewish ancestors (at rightmost) were considered Jews. The center column shows the [[Mischling Test|''Mischling'' grade]], either 1 or 2, depending on the number of one's Jewish ancestors. All Jewish grandparents were automatically defined as members of the [[Judaism|Jewish religious community]] (regardless of whether they actually identified their religion as such.)]]
As defined by the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935, a [[Jews|Jew]] (''[[Istjude]]'' or ''Volljude'' in Nazi terminology) was a person – regardless of religious affiliation or self-identification – who had at least three grandparents who had been enrolled with a Jewish congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. §5 (1) "Jude ist, wer von mindestens drei der Rasse nach volljüdischen Großeltern abstammt. § 2 Abs.[atz] 2 Satz 2 findet Anwendung." (translated: A Jew is defined as one who descends from at least three (racially) fully Jewish grandparents. § 2 section 2 sentence 2 is applying.), whereas §2 (2) says: "Jüdischer Mischling ist, wer von einem oder zwei der Rasse nach volljüdischen Großelternteilen abstammt, sofern er nicht nach § 5 Abs.[atz] 2 als Jude gilt. Als volljüdisch gilt ein Großelternteil ohne weiteres, wenn er der jüdischen Religionsgemeinschaft angehört hat." (translated: A Jewish Mischling is defined as one who descends from one or two (racially) fully Jewish grandparents, unless he is considered a Jew in accordance with § 5 (2). A grandparent is offhandedly considered fully Jewish if he has membership with the Jewish religious body.), see: [http://www.verfassungen.de/de/de33-45/reichsbuerger35-v1.htm ''Erste Verordnung zum Reichsbürgergesetz vom 14. November 1935'' (First ordinance on the Reich's Citizen Act of 14 November 1935)], retrieved on 23 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A person with two Jewish grandparents was also legally "Jewish" (so-called ''[[Geltungsjude]]'', roughly speaking, in {{lang-en|"Jew by legal validity"}} or "to be deemed/reckoned as a Jew") if that person met any of these conditions:
*Was enrolled as member of a Jewish congregation when the Nuremberg Laws were issued, or joined later&lt;ref&gt;A later secession from the Jewish community did not affect the classification as ''Geltungsjude''. Secession from religious Jewish congregations remained possible until July 1939, when the [[Gestapo]] transformed them all into its subdivisions, forced to enlist every person discriminated as ''Geltungsjude'' or Jew according to the Nuremberg Laws.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Was married to a Jew.
*Was the offspring from a marriage with a Jew, which was concluded after the ban on [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|mixed marriages]].
*Was the offspring of an extramarital affair with a Jew, born out of wedlock after 31 July 1936''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. §5 (2) d of [http://www.verfassungen.de/de/de33-45/reichsbuerger35-v1.htm ''Erste Verordnung zum Reichsbürgergesetz vom 14. November 1935'' (First ordinance on the Reich's Citizen Act of 14 November 1935)], retrieved on 23 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
A person who did not belong to any of these categorical conditions but had two Jewish grandparents was classified as a Jewish ''Mischling'' of the first degree. A person with only one Jewish grandparent was classified as a ''Mischling'' of the second degree.&lt;ref&gt;R. Hilberg, ''Perpetrators, Victims, Bystanders'', pp. 150ff.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Mischling Test]].

==Jewish identity==
Soon after passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], the Nazi government promulgated several [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] statutes, including the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] on 7 April 1933. Using this law, the regime aimed to dismiss—along with all politically-suspect persons such as social democrats, socialists, communists and many liberals of all religions—all "non-Aryans" from all government positions in society, including public educators, and those practicing medicine in state hospitals.

As a result, the term "non-Aryan"&lt;ref&gt;The rather awkward term was a circumlocution for "Jew" ({{lang-de|italic=yes|Jude}}) and was used in legal parlance until the Nuremberg Laws of September 1935. See [[Mischling Test]].&lt;/ref&gt; had to be defined in a way compatible with Nazi ideology. Under the "First Racial Definition" supplementary decree of 11 April, issued to clarify portions of the act passed four days prior, a "non-Aryan" (''e.g.'' a Jew) was defined as one who had at least one Jewish parent or grandparent. Later, German citizens with only one Jewish grandparent were defined by the Nuremberg Laws as ''Mischling'' of the second degree. Their employment restrictions remained, but they were permitted to marry non-Jewish and non-''Mischling'' Germans, and were not imprisoned. This distinction was not applied to non-German citizens.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Mischling Test]] article for more detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the philosophy of Nazi antisemitism, Jewry was considered a group of people bound by close, genetic (blood) ties who formed an [[ethnic group|ethnic unit]] that one could neither join nor secede from. Early 20th-century books on [[Nordic race#Nordicism|Nordicism]] such as [[Madison Grant]]'s ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', had a profound effect on Hitler's antisemitism. He was convinced that the Nordic Race/Culture constituted a superior branch of humanity, and viewed International Jewry as a parasitic and inferior race, determined to corrupt and exterminate both Nordic peoples and their culture through ''[[Rassenschande]]'' ("racial pollution") and cultural corruption.

Another important factor in Nazi antisemitism was the growing presence of [[Marxism]] and [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]] in Europe,  particularly in Germany. Hitler declared that [[Jewish Bolshevism|Marxism was constructed by International Jewry]], with the aim of Bolshevising the earth, ultimately allowing Jewry to dominate/exterminate the Aryan race. With this in mind, Hitler viewed Russia as a nation of ''[[Untermensch]]en'' ("subhumans" or 'Inferiors") dominated by their Judaic masters, which posed the gravest threat to both Germany and Europe as a whole.

The Nazis defined Jewishness as partly genetic, but did not always use formal genetic tests or [[physiognomy|physiognomic]] (facial) features to determine one's status (although the Nazis talked a lot about physiognomy as a racial characteristic). In practice, records concerning the religious affiliation(s) of one's grandparents were often the deciding factor (mostly christening records and membership registers of Jewish congregations).&lt;ref&gt;Outward features of one's physiognomy could play a role in paternity suits seeking reclassification and/or obtaining/debating ''Mischling'' degree.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standards of the Schutzstaffel===
The [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) used a more stringent standard: In order to join, a candidate had to prove (presumably through [[baptism]]al records) that all direct ancestors born since 1750 were not Jewish, or they would have to apply for a [[German Blood Certificate]] instead. Later, when the stresses of the war made it implausible to confirm the ancestry of officer candidates, the extended proof of ancestry regulation was diminished to the standard laws requiring certified evidence of non-Judaism within two generations.

===Jewish ''Mischlinge'' as Christian converts===
In the 19th century, many Jewish Germans converted to [[Christianity]]; most of them becoming [[Protestantism|Protestants]] rather than [[Catholic Church|Catholics]].&lt;ref&gt;According to the 1933 census concerning Germany, in an overall population of 62 million, 41 million parishioners enlisted with one of the 28 different [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[United and uniting churches|United]] Protestant [[Landeskirche|church bodies]], making up 66% of the people; as opposed to 21.1 million Catholics (32,5%). The largest of which, the [[Prussian Union of churches|Evangelical Church of the Old Prussian Union]], comprised 18 million enlisted parishioners. Noteworthy families of Jewish descent who converted to Protestantism included those of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. The borders of Germany changed several times between the [[Napoleonic era]] and the rise of [[Nazi Germany]]. Areas at times under French or Polish political or cultural dominance were overwhelmingly Catholic within the Gentile community.&lt;/ref&gt; Two-thirds of the German population were Protestant until 1938, when the [[Anschluss]] annexation of Austria to Germany added six million Catholics. The addition of 3.25 million Catholic Czechoslovaks of German ethnicity ([[Sudetenland|Sudeten]] Germans) increased the percentage of Roman Catholics in Greater Germany to 41% (approximately 32.5 million vs. 45.5 million Protestants or 57%) in a 1939 population estimated at 79 million. One percent of the population was Jewish.

German converts from Judaism typically adopted whichever Christian denomination was most dominant in their community. Therefore, about 80% of the [[Gentile]] Germans persecuted as Jews according to the Nuremberg Laws were affiliated with one of the 28 regionally-delineated Protestant church bodies.&lt;ref&gt;''›Büro Pfarrer Grüber‹ Evangelische Hilfsstelle für ehemals Rasseverfolgte. Geschichte und Wirken heute'', edited by the Evangelische Hilfsstelle für ehemals Rasseverfolgte ("Evangelical Centre to Help the Formerly Racially Persecuted"), Berlin: no publ., 1988, p. 8. No ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 approximately 77% of German Gentiles with Jewish ancestry were Protestant, the percentage dropped to 66% in the 1939 census, after the annexations of 1938 (due in particular to the acquisition of [[Vienna]] and [[Prague]], with their relatively large and well-established Catholic populations of Jewish descent).&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Büttner, "Von der Kirche verlassen: Die deutschen Protestanten und die Verfolgung der Juden und Christen jüdischer Herkunft im »Dritten Reich«", In: ''Die verlassenen Kinder der Kirche: Der Umgang mit Christen jüdischer Herkunft im »Dritten Reich«'', Ursula Büttner and Martin Greschat (eds.), Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1998, pp. 15-69, here footnote 20 on pp. 20seq. {{ISBN|3-525-01620-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Converts to Christianity and their descendants had often married Christians with no recent Jewish ancestry.

As a result, by the time the Nazis came to power, many Protestants and Roman Catholics in Germany had some traceable Jewish ancestry (usually traced back by the Nazi authorities for two generations), so that the majority of 1st- or 2nd-degree ''Mischlinge'' were Protestant, yet many were Catholics. A considerable number of German Gentiles with Jewish ancestry were [[irreligion]]ists.

Lutherans with Jewish ancestry were largely in northwestern and [[northern Germany]], [[Prussian Union of churches|Evangelical Protestants]] of Jewish descent in [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]] (Berlin and its southwestern environs) and the [[former eastern territories of Germany|country's east]]. Catholics with Jewish ancestry lived mostly in [[Western Germany|Western]] and [[Southern Germany]], [[Austria]] and what is now the [[Czech Republic]].

===Reclassification procedures===
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein siblings.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Hermine and Fanny Wittgenstein (sisters of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]) were re-classified as "Aryan" after paying an undisclosed fortune to the Nazi party.]] Requests for reclassification (e.g., Jew to ''Mischling'' of 1st degree, ''Mischling'' of 1st degree to 2nd degree, etc. ) or [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]] (see [[German Blood Certificate]]) were personally reviewed by [[Adolf Hitler]]. A reclassification approved by the Nazi party chancery and Hitler was considered an act of grace (''Gnadenakt''). Other de facto reclassifications, lacking any official document, were privileges accorded by high-ranking Nazis to certain artists and other experts by way of special protection.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. for reclassifications by way of acts of mercy and other forms: Beate Meyer,'' 'Jüdische Mischlinge' – Rassenpolitik und Verfolgungserfahrung 1933–1945'' (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;1999), Hamburg: Dölling und Galitz, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2002, Studien zur jüdischen Geschichte; vol. 6, simultaneously Hamburg, Univ., Diss., 1998, {{ISBN|3-933374-22-7}}, especially chapter 'IV. Andere "Ehrenarier"' (Other "honorary Aryans"), pp. 152–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second way of reclassification was by way of [[declaratory judgment]] in court. Usually the discriminated person took the action, questioning their descent from the Jewish-classified man until then regarded as their biological (grand)father.&lt;ref&gt;One action was recorded where the plaintiff questioned the parentage of his Jewish-classified mother, claiming he had been confused in the maternity clinic for another infant.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paternity law|Paternity suits]] aiming for reclassification ({{lang-de|Abstammungsverfahren|links=no}}) appeared mostly with deceased, divorced, or illegitimate (grand)fathers. They usually sought to change the discriminated litigant's status from Jewish-classified to ''Mischling'' of first degree, or from ''Mischling'' of first degree to second degree. The numbers of such suits soared whenever the Nazi government imposed new discriminations and persecutions (such as the Nuremberg Laws 1935, [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, and systematic [[Deportation#Deportation in the Holocaust|deportations of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent]] to concentration camps, 1941).&lt;ref&gt;The "Institute for Genetics and Racial Hygienics" in [[Frankfurt]] delivered 448 medical evidences for paternity suits aiming for reclassification in Frankfurt and its environs. In December 1938 the Institute of Racial Biology of the [[University of Hamburg]] complained that since the Kristallnacht judges demanded every week 20 more medical evidences for paternity suits aiming for reclassification in [[Hamburg]]. Cf. Beate Meyer,'' 'Jüdische Mischlinge' – Rassenpolitik und Verfolgungserfahrung 1933–1945'' (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;1999), Hamburg: Dölling und Galitz, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2002, Studien zur jüdischen Geschichte; vol. 6, simultaneously Hamburg, Univ., Diss., 1998, pp. 112seq. {{ISBN|3-933374-22-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process was humiliating for the (grand)mothers who had to declare in court that they had committed adultery. The petitions were successful in the majority of cases. The high success rate was a result of several factors. First, some lawyers specialised in such procedures, prepared them professionally, and refused hopeless cases. There was no danger in the procedures because failure did not downgrade the classification of the litigant. Second, usually all the family members cooperated; including the sometimes still-living disputed (grand)father. Likely alternative fathers were often named, who either appeared themselves in court confirming their likely fatherhood, or who were already dead but were known as good friends, neighbours, or subtenants of the (grand)mother. Third, the obligatory and humiliating body examinations of those under suspicion were skewed by stereotypical Jewish perceptions. Expert witnesses would search for allegedly Jewish facial features, as conceived and understood by anti-Semites. If the doubted (grand)father was already dead, emigrated, or deported (as after 1941), the examination searched for these supposedly "Jewish" features in the physiognomy of the descendant (child). Since anti-Semitic clichés on Jewish outward appearance were so stereotyped, the average litigant did not show features clearly indicating their Jewish descent, so they often documented ambiguous results as medical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Furthermore, many of the involved public health officers did not believe in the pseudo-scientific categories of Aryan and Jewish races, but considered it a farce, and would even tell this to their patients during examination. So there exists the possibility that they delivered ambiguous medical evidences on purpose.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth, the judges tended to believe the accounts of the (grand)mothers, alternative fathers, doubted fathers, and other witnesses who had endured such public humiliation. They were not recorded for earlier perjuring, and judges would declare the prior paternity annulled, ensuring the status improvement for the litigant.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. for reclassifications by paternity suits the very instructive book: Beate Meyer,'' 'Jüdische Mischlinge' – Rassenpolitik und Verfolgungserfahrung 1933–1945'' (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;1999), Hamburg: Dölling und Galitz, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2002, Studien zur jüdischen Geschichte; vol. 6, simultaneously Hamburg, Univ., Diss., 1998, {{ISBN|3-933374-22-7}}, especially chapter 'III. Abstammungsverfahren vor Zivilgerichten' (suits on descent in ordinary courts), pp. 109–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effective assimilation of Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent into their Gentile (and Christian) surroundings made matters much more complicated than the Nazis had anticipated; widespread corruption, and lack of ethical moorings among many Nazi leaders, frequently gave way to bribery, extortion, and other subterfuges concerning documentation of who was, or was not, a Jew.

==Numbers of people considered Jewish ''Mischlinge''==
According to the 1939 Reich census, there were about 72,000 ''Mischlinge'' of the 1st degree, ~39,000 of the 2nd degree, and potentially tens of thousands at higher degrees, which went unrecorded as those people were considered Aryan by the Reich.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bankier, in ''Holocaust and Genocide Studies'', Volume 3, Number 1 (1988), pp. 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Bryan Mark Rigg]], an [[GOC Army Headquarters|Israeli Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] veteran, up to 160,000 soldiers who were one-quarter, one-half, and even fully Jewish served in the German armed forces during [[World War II]]. This included several generals, admirals, and at least one field marshal, [[Erhard Milch]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Mark Rigg, ''Hitler's Jewish Soldiers: The Untold Story Of Nazi Racial Laws And Men Of Jewish Descent In The German Military'' (Modern War Studies) (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7006-1358-7}} (see also "External links"). On p. 300 Rigg discusses Jewish conversion to Roman Catholicism and to Lutheranism but does not offer a deduction on which of those two largest religious orientations among Germans was more likely to attract the Jewish converts.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisations of ''Mischlinge''==
On 20 July 1933, initiated by the actor Gustav Friedrich, Christian Germans of Jewish descent founded a self-help organisation, initially named ''Reich Federation of Christian-German Citizens of non-Aryan or not of purely Aryan descent'' ({{lang-de|Reichsbund christlich-deutscher Staatsbürger nichtarischer oder nicht rein arischer Abstammung e.V.}}). The federation first counted only 4,500 members.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hartmut Ludwig, "Das ›Büro Pfarrer Grüber‹ 1938–1940", In: ''›Büro Pfarrer Grüber‹ Evangelische Hilfsstelle für ehemals Rasseverfolgte. Geschichte und Wirken heute'', Walter Sylten, Joachim-Dieter Schwäbl and Michael Kreutzer on behalf of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Evangelische Hilfsstelle für ehemals Rasseverfolgte|de}} (ed.; Evangelical Relief Centre for the formerly Racially Persecuted), Berlin: Evangelische Hilfsstelle für ehemals Rasseverfolgte, 1988, pp. 1–23, here p. 4. No ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1934 the name was shortened to ''Reich association of non-Aryan Christians'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Reichsverband der nichtarischen Christen}}).&lt;ref&gt;Hans Faust, "Vorläufer des Bundes der Verfolgten des Naziregimes Berlin e. V.", in: ''Die Mahnung'' (periodical of the Bund der Verfolgten des Naziregimes Berlin e. V., ie Berlin Federation of the Persecuted of the Nazi Regime), 1 September 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, members of the federation elected the known literary historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Heinrich Spiero|de}} their new president. Under his direction the federation's journal was improved and the number of members rose to 80,000 by 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Felicitas Bothe-von Richthofen, ''Widerstand in Wilmersdorf'', [[Memorial to the German Resistance]] (ed.), Berlin: Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand, 1993, (=Schriftenreihe über den Widerstand in Berlin von 1933 bis 1945; vol. 7), pp. 140seq. {{ISBN|3-926082-03-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1936, the federation was renamed the more confident ''St Paul's Covenant Union of non-Aryan Christians'' ({{lang-de|Paulus-Bund Vereinigung nichtarischer Christen e.V.}}) after the famous Jewish convert to Christianity [[Paul the Apostle]].

In January 1937 the Nazi government forbade that organisation, allowing a new successor organisation named the ''1937 Association of Provisional Reich Citizens of not purely German-blooded Descent'' ({{lang-de|Vereinigung 1937 vorläufiger Reichsbürger nicht rein deutschblütiger Abstammung}}). This name cited the insecure legal status of ''Mischlinge'', who had been assigned the revocable status of preliminary Reich's citizens by the Nuremberg Laws, while Jewish-classified Germans had become second-class state citizens (''Staatsbürger'') by these laws. The 1937 Association was prohibited from accepting state citizens as members—like Spiero—with three or four grandparents, who had been enrolled in a Jewish congregation. Thus that new association had lost its most prominent leaders and faded, having become an organisation solely for ''Mischlinge''. The ''1937 Association'' was compulsorily dissolved in 1939.

Pastor [[Heinrich Grüber]] and some enthusiasts started a new effort in 1936 to found an organisation to help Protestants of Jewish descent (''Mischlinge'' and their (grand)parents, of whom at least one was classified as non-Aryan), but went completely neglected by the then official Protestant church bodies in Germany (see [[Prussian Union of churches#Protestants of Jewish descent]]).

After the war some ''Mischlinge'' founded the still-existing ''Notgemeinschaft der durch die Nürnberger Gesetze Betroffenen'' (Emergency association of the aggrieved by the Nuremberg Laws).

==Fate during the Nazi era==

===Discrimination in education, vocation and marriage===
Those who were considered ''Mischlinge'' were generally restricted in their options of partners and marriage. ''Mischlinge'' of first degree generally needed permission to marry, and usually only to other ''Mischlinge'' or Jewish-classified persons; however, a marriage to a Jewish-classified person would re-categorize the ''Mischling'' as ''Geltungsjude'' (Full Jew). After 1942, marriage permissions were generally not granted any more—arguably due to the war—without further notice. ''Mischlinge'' of second degree did not need permission to marry a spouse classified as Aryan; however, marriage with ''Mischlinge'' of any degree was unwelcome. The reasoning behind this was that a ''mischling'' marrying an Aryan would produce a child with an acceptably low amount of Jewish heritage, but a ''mischling'' marrying a ''mischling'' would just produce another ''mischling''.

1st-degree ''Mischlinge'', more so than those of 2nd-degree, had restricted access to higher education and were generally forbidden from attending such schools in 1942. As for vocations, most jobs in the public sphere—such as journalism, teaching, performing arts, government positions, politics etc.—were inaccessible to ''Mischlinge''. Exceptions were granted for some prominent persons and those who acquired the necessary German blood certificates.

===Recruitment into the Organisation Todt===
Beginning in the autumn of 1944, between 10,000 and 20,000 half-Jews (''Mischlinge'') and persons related to Jews by a so-called [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|mixed marriage]] were recruited into special units of the [[Organisation Todt]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolf Gruner (2006).

Published in association with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. {{ISBN|978-0-521-83875-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish Mischlinge in German-occupied Europe===
While the classifications of ''Mischling'' also applied in occupied Western and Central Europe, and were well-documented for the Netherlands and [[Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia]], this was not the case in Eastern Europe. Persons who would have been deemed Jewish ''Mischlinge'', in the East were classified as Jews in German-annexed Poland ([[Danzig-West Prussia]], [[Warthegau]], etc.), German-occupied Poland ([[General Government]]), German-occupied parts of the Soviet Union, and the German-occupied Soviet-annexed [[Baltic states|Baltic]]/Eastern Polish territories. Consequently, an unknown number of Christians of recent Jewish background from Poland and other occupied territories, primarily Catholics or Eastern Orthodox in this case, were killed as "Jewish" in the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler’s Shadow War: The Holocaust and World War II.

==Synopsis==
Ari, a young shaman of the Royal Star Mansion (Royal Astrology House), is awakened one night by a psychic impression of imminent danger to one of the king's sons, who was considered a potential rival for the throne. When she investigates, she witnesses his murder and is discovered by the perpetrators who gave chase. She manages to escape but is greatly injured in the process. The next day, after she receives help from the pregnant wife of the palace's Chief Scholar, Ari has a vision about the fate of the unborn child. In gratitude for the aid she received, Ari promises to watch over the child, even in death.

Later that day, Ari is arrested, tortured, and thrown in jail. Her friend and fellow shaman, Jang Nok-yeong, visits her in secret. Ari tells Nok-yeong that she has foreseen the birth of a young woman who has a "noble fate" and who is connected to the royal house. Knowing that her death is near, Ari begs Nok-yeong to watch over this child in her stead. Nok-yeong makes a promise without even knowing who or where the child is. The next day, Ari is declared guilty of treason and tortured, refusing to lie about the murder, and is executed by a primitive form of dismemberment while receiving visions of the future once more.

Several years pass and the aristocratic but modest and loving Heo family now includes two children: seventeen-year-old son Yeom and thirteen-year-old daughter, Yeon-woo (which means "misty rain"). Even at such a young age, Yeon-woo already exhibits wisdom beyond her years. One day, Yeon-woo accompanies her mother to the royal palace to attend Yeom's [[Gwageo|civil service examination]] congratulatory ceremony. During this visit, Yeon-woo wanders away from the ceremony after being distracted by a butterfly and has a chance encounter with Crown Prince Lee Hwon. Although there was brief misunderstanding about each other's identities, as a result of their chance encounter, Lee Hwon and Yeon-woo fall in love.

Meanwhile, Yeom's outstanding scholarship caused him to be immediately engaged as a tutor for the Crown Prince. Yeon-woo, on the other hand, is chosen to be a companion for the prepubescent Princess Min-Hwa along with Bo-kyung, the ambitious and deceitful daughter of the palace's Prime Minister and maternal blood relative to the Queen Dowager. Jang Nok-yeong, now the Head Shaman, realizes that Yeon-Woo is the child whom Ari begged her to protect years ago. 

Min-hwa, the younger sister of Crown Prince Lee Hwon, is a young girl of mercurial moods who cries, whines, and screams when she does not get her way. Upon seeing her brother's handsome "Teacher Heo", Min-hwa becomes obsessed with him. When she discovers that Yeon-woo is Teacher Heo's sister she expresses her preference for Yeon-woo's company. Bo-kyung, who is all but ignored by the princess, feels slighted and jealous about the princess' favoritism. Min-hwa soon asks her father to allow her to marry Yeom. The king refuses, for reasons that are rooted in tradition, political strategy, and socio-cultural correctness. He explains to Min-hwa that the husband of a princess(Prince Consort) is not allowed to be involved in political matters and cannot have any governmental position. He also says that Yeom is an intelligent and morally upright person and that by allowing the princess to marry him, would ruin his political aspirations. Enraged and devastated, Min-hwa throws a terrible tantrum.

Some time later, Yeon-woo is demonstrated to be the superior choice (over Bo-kyung and another young woman) to wed Lee Hwon and become the Crown Princess of Joseon. This decision upsets Prince Yang Myung, the Crown Prince's freewheeling but misunderstood half-brother, who has also met and fallen in love with Yeon-woo, as well as Bo-kyung and her corrupt father, Prime Minister Yoon.

Yeon-woo undertakes her training to become the Crown Princess; she seems to be a bit physically clumsy at first, but is also lovingly courted by Crown Prince Lee Hwon during the training period.

Before Lee Hwon and Yeon-woo can marry, the Queen Dowager secretly orders Nok-yeong to cast a curse on Yeon-woo to afflict her with a sickness that will lead to her death. The Queen Dowager wants to install her blood relative, Bo-kyung, as the Crown Princess instead. Nok-yeong breaks her promise to protect Yeon-woo, feeling that she has no choice but to obey the Queen Dowager. The Queen Dowager uses Princess Min-hwa as a conduit to intensify the effect of the shaman's spell, as it is known that a young virgin with strong desires and motivations lend a great deal of power to sorcery. The Queen Dowager promises Min-hwa that if she participates in the spell, Min-hwa can have what she wants: to marry Yeom. Min-hwa's selfish immaturity and obsession with Yeom lead her to participate willingly, though it is also clear that she was manipulated by the Queen Dowager.

The black magic is successful and Yeon-woo is diagnosed with an unidentifiable illness by the royal physicians. She is thus expelled from the palace, losing her title as Crown Princess. As she inches closer and closer to death, Nok-yeong secretly visits Yeon-woo's father and gives him a special potion, promising that it will bring a peaceful death for his daughter. He gives her the potion and she dies, as her death is the only way to release her from the spell. After her burial, Nok-yeong and a paid help hurriedly dig up the grave and retrieve Yeon-woo, knowing that she will soon awaken from the potion. Yeon-woo is deeply traumatized by dying and then waking up buried alive, losing all memories of her previous life. With assistance and support from a Taoist priest, Shaman Jang, Yeon-woo, and Seol (the Heo family's loyal former maidservant) go into hiding in a distant location.

Crown Prince Lee Hwon is soon married to Bo-kyung. Lee Hwon flatly refuses to consummate the marriage with Bo-kyung; he repeatedly feigns illness in order to avoid physical intimacy and further tries to avoid any interactions at all with her. The only people Lee Hwon allows near him are the eunuch who serves him and the sword master Woon. Woon's ever-presence with the prince leads some in the palace to quietly question Lee Hwon's sexuality, not understanding that Lee Hwon's heart still belongs to a woman presumed dead. Bo-kyung becomes progressively more humiliated and bitter about the Crown Prince's obvious distaste for her. The king dies, and Crown Prince Lee Hwon becomes the King of Joseon. With the former king's death, the need for Lee Hwon to produce an heir to the throne becomes more and more urgent. For this reason, the people around Lee Hwon are willing to try anything to help him recover from his "illness."

Eight years later, it is learned that the flow of the universe has shifted and the three "exiles" in hiding are sent back to the capital city. Yeon-woo has now become a shaman after being adopted as a "spiritual daughter" by Shaman Jang. Shaman Jang has sworn Seol to secrecy about Yeon-woo's true identity. Yeon-woo, now known as Shaman Wol (which means "moon") returns to the palace as a living talisman - a "bad-luck-absorbing" shaman — suggested by Shaman Jang as a way to cure the king's "illness." The king awakens one night to find Shaman Wol sitting by his bedside, and her unmistakable resemblance to his true love, Yeon-woo, causes the young king to start questioning what really happened to Yeon-woo eight years ago and quietly launches a thorough investigation. Meanwhile, Yeon-woo must try to understand the strange memories that are coming back to her while simultaneously contending with Queen Bo-kyung, the Queen's Father (who is still the Prime Minister), and the Queen Dowager in order to claim her rightful place as the Queen of Joseon. Political intrigue continues to build and comes shockingly to a head as King Lee Hwon fights for his throne, fights for the woman he loves, and fights for his very life.

==Production==
Based on the novel by [[Jung Eun-gwol]], the screenplay was written by Jin Soo-wan (writer of ''[[Capital Scandal]]''); and directed by Kim Do-hoon (who previously directed ''[[Royal Family (TV series)|Royal Family]]'') and Lee Seong-jun (who previously directed ''[[Gyebaek (TV series)|Gyebaek]]'').

This production marked [[Han Ga-in]]'s first historical drama and return to television since ''[[Bad Guy (TV series)|Bad Guy]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Park|first=Hyun-min|title=Han Ga In to Star in ''The Sun and the Moon''|url=http://enewsworld.mnet.com/enews/contents.asp?idx=1805|accessdate=December 14, 2012|newspaper=enewsWorld|date=November 28, 2011|agency=CJ E&amp;M}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also [[Jung Il-woo]]'s second historical drama following ''[[The Return of Iljimae]]'' in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Choi|first=Eun-hwa|title=Jung Il Woo to Star in ''The Sun and the Moon''|url=http://enewsworld.mnet.com/enews/contents.asp?idx=1967|accessdate=December 14, 2012|newspaper=enewsWorld|date=December 6, 2011|agency=CJ E&amp;M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming began in November 2011 with child actors for the first six episodes, followed by the script reading session with their adult counterparts on December 25 at MBC Dream Center in [[Ilsan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=In-kyung|title=Han Ga In Meets with Stars of ''The Sun and the Moon'' for Christmas|url=http://enewsworld.mnet.com/enews/contents.asp?idx=2385|accessdate=December 14, 2012|newspaper=enewsWorld|date=December 26, 2011|agency=CJ E&amp;M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, there were talks of an extension of four episodes to the 20-episode drama. The production company, Ten Entertainment later confirmed that there would be no extension and the series was to end on its original date of March 8, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hong|first=Lucia|title=Extension for MBC TV series ''Moon'' not finalized|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2012021715150712913|accessdate=October 19, 2012|newspaper=10Asia|date=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hong|first=Lucia|title=MBC's TV series ''Moon'' will not be extended|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2012022209304650325|accessdate=October 19, 2012|newspaper=10Asia|date=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it did not end till March 15, 2012, because director Kim Do-hoon joined the MBC strike leading to the last two episodes being delayed for a week, and replaced with two special episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Suk|first=Monica|title=''Moon'' remains unchallengeable despite its replacement with series' special|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2012030910310986843|accessdate=October 19, 2012|newspaper=10Asia|date=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shooting period spanned over the cold months in Korea, which added to the actors' difficulties as there were quite a number of outdoor scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.hankooki.com/lpage/entv/201201/sp2012013006013694350.htm|script-title=ko:훤도 연우도 하하하!

===Filming locations===
Most of the royal palace scenes were filmed on location at [[MBC Dramia]] located at [[Cheoin-gu]], [[Yongin|Yongin-si]] in [[Gyeonggi Province]], where other historical dramas such as ''[[Dong Yi (TV series)|Dong Yi]]'', ''[[Jumong (TV series)|Jumong]]'' and ''[[Queen Seondeok (TV series)|Queen Seondeok]]'' were also filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Cin Woo|title=Beyond Seoul: 19 reasons to explore Korea|url=http://www.cnngo.com/seoul/visit/9-provinces-19-attractions-korea-311599|accessdate=May 6, 2012|newspaper=[[CNN]] Go|date=March 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Choi Champan was used as Yeon-woo's childhood home, and the [[Korean Folk Village]] was used for local markets, private residences of commoners, and night scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Korean TV Drama: ''The Moon Enbracing the Sun''|url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/CU/CU_EN_8_5_1_72.jsp|work=[[Korea Tourism Organization]]|accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International broadcast==
In March 2012, the drama's broadcast rights were sold to eight Asian countries, including Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. At that time it set the record as the most profitable drama for MBC, which was later surpassed by ''[[Arang and the Magistrate]]'' in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''Moon Embracing the Sun'' to be exported to seven Asian locales|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/html/926/2948926.html|accessdate=October 31, 2012|newspaper=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=February 24, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126232014/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/html/926/2948926.html|archivedate=January 26, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sunwoo|first=Carla|title=Lee Joon-gi's drama breaks Japanese sales record|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2958539|accessdate=October 15, 2012|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=August 29, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127003652/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2958539|archivedate=January 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers [[3|three]] and [[9|nine]] are significant numbers in [[Norse mythology]] and [[Norse paganism|paganism]]. Both numbers (and multiplications thereof) appear throughout surviving attestations of Norse paganism, in both  mythology and cultic practice.&lt;ref name=SIMEK232-233&gt;Simek (2007:232-233).&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number three appears significant in many cultures, Norse mythology appears to put special emphasis on the number nine.  Along with the number 27, both numbers also figure into the [[lunar calendar|lunar]] [[Germanic calendar]].&lt;ref name=SIMEK232-233/&gt;

==Attestations==
===Three===
{{See|Triple deity}}
The number three occurs with great frequency in grouping individuals and artifacts:
*There are three distinct races of giants: the mountain giants, frost giants and fire giants.
*There were three original beings: the primordial cow [[Audhumla]], [[Ymir]] the first giant, and [[Búri]] the first god and grandfather of [[Odin]].
*For three days Audhumla licked the ice of [[Ginnungagap]] until Búri was freed.
*Ymir had three direct offspring: a boy and girl who grew from beneath his arms and a six-headed son who sprang from the coupling of his feet.
*There were three generations of giants before the race as a whole was destroyed by the [[deluge (mythology)|deluge]] of [[Ymir's blood]], after which time his grandson [[Bergelmir]] became the progenitor of a new line.
*The heart of the giant [[Hrungnir]] was [[triangle|triangular]] and made of stone.
*There are three named [[Norns]].
*Odin had two brothers, [[Vili and Vé]] (or [[Lodur]] and [[Hoenir]] according to ''Völuspá''), numbering three sons of [[Borr]] who created the world and gave life to the first human beings.
*Odin is the ruler of the third generation of gods as the son of Borr and grandson of Búri.
*[[Yggdrasil]] the [[World Tree]] has three roots, and three is the square root of the number of worlds (nine) joined by Yggdrasil. Under the three roots are three sacred wells, one for each, including the Well of [[Wyrd|Urd]] in [[Asgard]], the [[Well of Mimir]] located "among the frost giants", and [[Hvergelmir]] in [[Niflheim]].
*Odin endured three hardships upon the World Tree in his quest for the [[runic alphabet|runes]]: he hanged himself, wounded himself with a spear, and suffered from hunger and thirst.
*In the ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' section of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', King [[Gylfi]] is confronted by a triple throne at the home of the gods, one being seated and occupied atop another.
*[[Loki]] has three malign progeny by the giantess [[Angrboda]]: the wolf [[Fenrir]], [[Jörmungandr]] the World Serpent, and [[Hel (being)|Hel]].
*Prior to [[Ragnarök]], there will be three hard winters without an intervening summer, the [[Fimbulwinter]].
*There are three main events leading up to Ragnarök itself: the birth of Loki's three monstrous children, the death of [[Baldr]] and subsequent punishment of Loki, and the onset of Fimbulwinter. 
*The wolf Fenrir was bound by three fetters: Loeding, Drómi, and [[Gleipnir]], of which only the last held him.
*Loki is bound with three bonds made from the entrails of his son through holes in three upright slabs of rock, the first under his shoulders, the second under his loins and the third under the backs of his knees.
*In the poem ''[[Völuspá]]'' from the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', the monstrous hound [[Garmr]] howls three times at the [[Gnipahellir|Gnipa-cave]] (or at least, the description of his howling is repeated three times).
*In ''Völuspá'', the gods burn [[Gullveig]] three times and three times she is reborn.
*During the onset of Ragnarök three [[cockerel]]s will begin to crow, heralding the final conflict: [[Gullinkambi]] for the gods, [[Fjalar (rooster)|Fjalar]] for the giants and an unnamed third for the dead.
*[[Bifröst]] the rainbow bridge has three colours. It also has two other names, Ásbrú and Bilröst, thus having three names.
*[[Heimdall]] has three special powers in his role as guardian of the rainbow bridge. He needs less sleep than a bird, can see at night for a hundred leagues and is able to hear grass growing on the earth.
*Odin has three special possessions: His spear [[Gungnir]], his golden ring [[Draupnir]] and his eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]].
*[[Thor]] has three main weapons for use against the giants: his hammer [[Mjolnir]], a magical belt that doubles his strength and a pair of iron [[gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlets]] that allow him to wield the hammer.
*[[Freyr]] has three magical items, including the ship [[Skidbladnir]], his boar [[Gullinbursti]] and a sword with the ability to fight on its own which he gave to [[Skirnir]] in return for his role in the courtship of [[Gerðr|Gerd]].
*[[Freyja]] also has three special artefacts, including the priceless necklace [[Brisingamen]], a cloak that allows her to assume the form of a falcon and a chariot drawn by a pair of great cats.
*In the stronghold of the giant [[Útgarda-Loki]], Thor drank three mighty draughts from a [[drinking horn|horn]] during a drinking contest but gave up when he was unable to empty the horn of its contents; this was also one of three tasks he did -and failed- during his stay, the other two being to lift a cat (he made it lift a paw, leaving three on ground) and to defeat an old woman; it is later revealed that the horn was connected to the sea (which he leveled down by three fingers), the cat was the World Serpent and the old woman, the Old Age itself. Previous to this, Thor and his companions had met the giant, who was under the assumed name [[Skrýmir]], in the forest outside the castle. When Skrymir had gone to sleep during their journey together, Thor became annoyed by his loud snoring and struck at him three times with his hammer, but in each case the blow was misdirected through magic and illusion.
*The builder of the walls of Asgard offered to build them in three seasons in return for three prizes: the sun and moon and the hand of Freyja in marriage.
*Odin spent three nights with the giantess [[Gunnlod]] in order to obtain the [[mead of poetry]]. She then allowed him to take three drinks of the mead, one from each of three vessels.
*The group of dwarves known only as the [[sons of Ivaldi]] fashioned three wondrous artefacts, including the ship of Freyr, the spear of Odin and the golden hair of [[Sif]]. The dwarf brothers [[Eitri]] and [[Brokk]] also created three items, including the boar of Freyr, the golden ring of Odin and the hammer of Thor.
*There were three statues of Odin, Thor and Freyr in the [[Temple at Uppsala]].
*The goddess [[Frigg]] has three handmaidens, including [[Fulla]], [[Gná]] and [[Hlín]].
*Three of Odin's sons remain after Ragarök: Vidar, Baldr and Hǫðr.

===Nine===
The number nine is also a significant number:
* The [[Norse cosmology]] knows nine worlds that are supported by Yggdrasil.
* At the end of ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' is a list of nine heavenly realms provided by [[Snorri Sturluson|Snorri]], including, from the nethermost to the highest, Vindblain (also Heidthornir or Hregg-Mimir), [[Andlang]], [[Vidblain]], Vidfedmir, Hrjod, Hlyrnir, Gimir, Vet-Mimir and Skatyrnir which "stands higher than the clouds, beyond all worlds."
* Every ninth year, people from all over [[Sweden]] assembled at the Temple at Uppsala. There was feasting for nine days and sacrifices of both men and male animals according to [[Adam of Bremen]].
* In ''[[Skírnismál]]'', Freyr is obliged to wait nine nights to consummate his union with Gerd.
* In ''[[Svipdagsmál]]'', the witch [[Gróa]] grants nine charms to her son [[Svipdag]]. In the same poem there are nine maidens who sit at the knees of [[Menglod]].
* In ''[[Fjölsvinnsmál]]'', Laegjarn's chest is fastened with nine locks.
* During Ragnarök, Thor kills Jörmungandr but staggers back nine steps before falling dead himself, poisoned by the venom that the [[Serpent (symbolism)|Serpent]] spewed over him.
* According to the very late [[Trollkyrka poem]], the fire for the [[blót]] was lit with nine kinds of wood.
* Odin's ring Draupnir releases eight golden drops every ninth night, forming rings of equal worth for a total of nine rings.
* In the guise of ''Grímnir'' in the poem ''[[Grímnismál]]'', Odin allows himself to be held by King [[Geirröd]] for eight days and nights and kills him on the ninth after revealing his true identity.
* There are nine [[daughters of Ægir]].
* There are nine [[mothers of Heimdall]].
* There are nine great [[lindworm]]s: [[Jörmungandr]], [[Níðhöggr]], Grábakr, Grafvölluðr, Ofnir, Svafnir, Grafvitni and his sons Góinn and Móinn.
* The god [[Hermod]] rode Sleipnir for nine nights on his quest to free [[Baldr]] from the [[Hel (realm)|underworld]].
* The giant [[Baugi]] had nine thralls who killed each other in their desire to possess Odin's magical [[sharpening stone]].
* The god [[Njord]] and his wife [[Skadi]] decided to settle their argument over where to live by agreeing to spend nine nights in [[Thrymheim]] and nine nights at [[Nóatún (mythology)|Nóatún]].
* The giant [[Thrivaldi]] has nine heads.
* The clay giant [[Mokkurkalfi]] measured nine leagues high and three broad beneath the arms.
* When Odin sacrificed himself to himself, he hung upon the [[gallows]] of Yggdrasill for nine days and nights. In return, he secured rúnar 'runes, secret knowledge'.
* The [[valknut]] symbol is three interlocking triangles forming nine points.
* There are nine surviving deities of Ragnarök, including Baldr and [[Hödr]], [[Magni and Modi]], [[Vidar]] and [[Váli (son of Odin)|Váli]], Hoenir, the daughter of [[Sowilo|Sól]] and a ninth "powerful, mighty one, he who rules over everything".&lt;ref&gt;This last being from ''Völuspá'', who will "come from on high", is found only in the ''[[Hauksbók]]'' manuscript. Some scholars, including John Lindow (''Norse Mythology'', 2001), consider this to be a later Christian interpolation and a reference to the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1770">An '''Opele''' (spelled '''Opuele''' or '''Ocuele''' in [[Latin America]]) is a divination chain used in [[Traditional African religion|traditional African]] and [[Afro-American religions]], notably in [[Ifá]] and [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba tradition]].&lt;ref name="Bascom1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=William W. Bascom|title=Ifa Divination: Communication between Gods and Men in West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CS0h4Ye9puUC&amp;pg=PA33|date=22 March 1991|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-11465-5|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Babalawo]] (diviner) uses the Opele in order to communicate with the deity of wisdom/knowledge in the Yoruba tradition (Orunmila), who is able to identify the causes and solutions to personal and collective problems and restore harmony in the person's life through re-balancing of the person's destiny and/or Ori (personal deity).  The Opele is the minor divination tool used by Babalawos for Ifa divination; it is believed to be an "assistant" or "slave" of Orunmila, who communicates Orunmila's desires to the Babalawo and from the Babalawo back to Orunmila.  It is used for the majority of daily divination work.  For divination regarding important ceremonial revelations or life-long information about a client or for very important decisions, Babalawos elect to use their Ikin seeds, which they consider to be the physical representation of Orunmila himself.&lt;ref&gt;http://orishanet.org/consulta.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
In 1741, a [[Byzantine]] wooden icon of the [[Virgin Mary]] was discovered in one of the deep caves. A church was built above the cave, and since then, it has become a place of pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opuslibani.org.lb/Lebanon/dos010.html#The%20Virgin%20of The Main Christian Sanctuaries&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207222137/http://www.opuslibani.org.lb/Lebanon/dos010.html |date=2012-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Miracles of Our Lady of Bechouat==

Divine [[miracle]]s have been reported and attributed to Our Lady of Bechouat.  Thousands of worshippers have visited the sanctuary where they march from the village of [[Bechouat]] to the old church where the blue and white statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] stands.  The statue, a replica of the one at Our Lady of Pontmain&lt;ref&gt;[http://apotres.amour.free.fr/page7/pontmain.htm Our Lady of Pontmain site]&lt;/ref&gt; in France, was erected a century ago.&lt;ref name="Centre Catholique d'Information"&gt;[http://www.centre-catholique.com/newsdetails.asp?newid=4014 Centre Catholique d'Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some worshippers spend the nights humbly praying or in meditation at the church door.

One of the miracles attributed to Our Lady of Bechouat happened to a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] man, Tony Sukkar, 37, who resided in New York.  Sukkar suffered from a chronic disease, which paralyzed his upper body completely. Upon a visit to his native [[Lebanon]], Mr. Sukkar visited the old church where he prayed to be healed. Soon after, he was healed and able to move his upper body.  Sukkar constructed a statue of the Virgin Mary in his home town of [[Deir el Ahmar]] in honor of Our Lady of Bechouat.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

Both Lebanese and foreigners, Christian and Muslim worshipers have experienced divine miracles at Our Lady of Bechouat.  One happened to a young child of Muslim parents from Jordan. Mohammed Naef Al-Awwad Al-Hawadi was ten years old when he accompanied his parents on a pilgrimage to the old church.   The child saw the Virgin Mary's statue blink. Worshippers who spent the night at the church said they also saw the eyes, hands and rosary of the Virgin Mary's statue move.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}  In 1871, a similar occurrence had been reported at Our Lady of Pontmain in France.&lt;ref name="Centre Catholique d'Information"/&gt;

'''''Psilocybe medullosa''''' is a species of [[psychoactive mushroom]]. It was originally [[species description|described]] in 1898 as ''Naucoria medullosa'' by Italian mycologist [[Giacomo Bresadola]].&lt;ref name="Bresadola 1898"/&gt; Czech mycologist Jan Borovička transferred it to ''[[Psilocybe]]'' in 2007.&lt;ref name="Borovička 2007"/&gt; A widespread but rather rare species, it is found in Europe, where it grows as a [[saprobe]] on woody debris and detritus. Chemical analysis has been used to confirm the presence of the [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] compounds [[psilocin]] and [[psilocybin]] in the [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] but probably at low levels.&lt;ref name="Borovička 2015"/&gt; ''Psilocybe silvatica'' is its American sister species; it differs by subtle changes in molecular markers (LSU, ITS rDNA, and others).&lt;ref name="Borovička 2015"/&gt;

As a result, there is no [[official religion]] and [[religious freedom]] is protected.&lt;ref name=es_CONSTITUTION&gt;{{cite act |title=[[Constitution of Spain|Spanish Constitution]] |type=Constitution |number= |language=en |date=29 December 1978 |article=14, 16 &amp; 27.3 |articletype=Sections |page= |url=http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Hist_Normas/Norm/const_espa_texto_ingles_0.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2018 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Spanish Center for Sociological Research, 68.2% of Spaniards self-identify as Catholic Christians, 2.5% as followers of other faiths (including [[Islam]], [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]], [[Buddhism]] etc.), and 26.9% identify as atheists or non-believers {{as of|2018|September|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=CIS2018 /&gt; Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious worship. This same study shows that of the Spaniards who identify themselves as religious, 61.0% barely ever attend mass, 16.0% attend mass a few times a year, 7.0% few times per month, 13.3% almost every Sunday, and 1.9% multiple times per week.&lt;ref name=CIS2018 /&gt;

Although a majority of Spaniards are Catholics, most, especially those of the younger generations, ignore the Church's moral doctrines on issues such as [[pre-marital sex]], [[sexual orientation]], [[marriage]] or [[contraception]].&lt;ref name="LeMonde"&gt;{{cite news |last = Morel |first = Sandrine |coauthors = |title = La sécularisation express des jeunes Espagnols |trans-title= The express secularization of the Spanish youth |work = |pages = |publisher = [[Le Monde]] |date = 2017-02-01  | url = http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2017/02/01/la-secularisation-express-des-jeunes-espagnols_5072504_3214.html | language = French |accessdate = 2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/mundocristiano/elmundo/2011/July/Espana-es-el-pais-europeo-en-el-que-mas-retrocede-el-catolicismo/ |title=España experimenta retroceso en catolicismo - El Mundo - Mundo Cristiano|language=es |publisher=CBN.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DAWN"&gt;{{cite news |last = Tarvainen |first = Sinikka |coauthors = |title = Reforms anger Spanish church |work = |pages = |publisher = Dawn International |date = 2004-09-26 |url = http://www.dawn.com/2004/09/26/int5.htm |accessdate = 2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WWRN"&gt;{{cite news|last =|first =|coauthors =|title =Zapatero accused of rejecting religion|work =|pages =|publisher =Worldwide Religious News|date =2004-10-15|url =http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=15453&amp;sec=59&amp;con=53|accessdate =2008-03-21|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081023070458/http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=15453&amp;sec=59&amp;con=53|archivedate =2008-10-23|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CSMONITOR"/&gt; The total number of [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|parish priests]] shrank from 24,300 in 1975 to 18,500 in 2018, with an average age of 65.5 years.&lt;ref name=INFOCAT2018 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ESTADISTICA2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LV2016 /&gt; By contrast, some expressions of popular religiosity still thrive, often linked to local festivals.

==Attitudes==
While Roman Catholicism is still the largest religion in Spain, most Spaniards—and especially the younger—choose to ignore the Catholic teachings in morals, politics or sexuality, and do not attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] regularly.&lt;ref name="LeMonde" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite news |last = Abernethy |first = Bobby |coauthors = |title = Catholicism In Spain |work = |pages = |publisher = PBS |date = 2006-07-07 |url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week945/cover.html |accessdate = 2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"&gt;{{cite news |last = Sciolino |first = Elaine |coauthors = |title = Europeans Fast Falling Away From Church

[[Culture war]]s in Spain are far more related to politics than religion, and the huge unpopularity of typically religion-related issues like [[creationism]] prevent them from being used in such conflicts. [[Revivalism|Revivalist]] efforts by the [[Catholic Church]] and other creeds have not had any significant success out of their previous sphere of influence.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LAM"/&gt; According to the [[Eurobarometer]] 83 (2015), only 3% of Spaniards consider religion as one of their three most important values, just like in 2008 and even lower than the 5% European average.&lt;ref name=EUROBAROMETER83&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/eb/eb83/eb83_citizen_en.pdf|title=Eurobarometer 83 - Values of Europeans / Spring 2015|page=56|date=May 2015|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EUROBAROMETER69&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb69/eb69_values_en.pdf|title=Eurobarometer 69 - Values of Europeans |page=16 |date=November 2008|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; And according to the 2005 Eurobarometer Poll:&lt;ref name=EUROBAROMETER&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf|title=Eurobarometer on Social Values, Science and technology 2005 | page= 9|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 59% of Spaniards responded that "they believe there is a God."
* 21% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force".
* 18% answered that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force."

Evidence of the secular nature of contemporary Spain can be seen in the widespread support for the legalization of [[same-sex marriage in Spain]] &amp;mdash; over 70% of Spaniards support gay marriage according to a 2004 study by the Centre for Sociological Research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.es/ Centre for Sociological Research]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in June 2005 a bill was passed by 187 votes to 147 to allow gay marriage, making Spain the third country in the European Union to allow [[same-sex couple]]s to marry. This vote was split along conservative-liberal lines, with [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) and other left-leaning parties supporting the measure and the center-to-right [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) against it. However, when the Popular Party came into power, the law was not revoked or modified. Changes to the divorce laws to make the process quicker and to eliminate the need for a guilty party have also been popular. [[Abortion in Spain|Abortion]], contraception and [[emergency contraception]] are legal and readily available on par with Western European standards.

=== Irreligion and Atheism ===
{{Main|Irreligion in Spain}}
Irreligion in Spain is a phenomenon that exists at least since the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Andreu Navarra Ordoño: ''El ateísmo. La aventura de pensar libremente en España''. Editorial Cátedra, Madrid, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atheism]], [[agnosticism]] and [[freethinking]] became relatively popular (although the majority of the society was still very religious) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During the [[Spanish civil war]] irreligious people were repressed by the [[Francoism|Francoist side]], while religion was largely abolished among the [[Republicanism in Spain|republicans]]. During the [[Francoist dictatorship]] period (1939-1975) irreligion was not tolerated, following the [[National Catholicism|national-catholic]] ideology of the regime. Irreligious people could not be public workers or express their thoughts openly. After the [[Spanish democratic transition]] (1975-1982), restrictions on irreligion were lifted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/12/04/actualidad/1386184107_688211.html España aconfesional y católica.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the last decades religious practice has fallen dramatically and atheism and agnosticism have grown in popularity, with over 12 million people (26.4% of the population {{as of|2018|January|lc=y}})&lt;ref name=CIS2018 /&gt; with no religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/Espana-dejado-catolica-practicante_0_249875385.html España ha dejado de ser católica practicante.]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Basílica de Santiago 02.JPG|thumb|120px|[[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]]]

===Popular religion===
However, some expressions of popular religiosity still thrive, often linked to [[Religious festival|Christian festivals]] and local [[patron saint]]s. World famous examples include the [[Holy Week in Seville]], the [[Romería de El Rocío]] in Huelva or the [[Mystery Play of Elche]], while the [[San Fermín|Sanfermines in Pamplona]] and the [[Falles|Falles of Valencia]] have mostly lost their original religious nature. The continuing success of these festivals is the result of a mix of religious, cultural, social and economic factors including sincere devotion, local or family traditions, non-religious [[Festival|fiesta]] and [[Party|partying]], perceived beauty, cultural significance, territorial identity, meeting friends and relatives, increased sales and a massive influx of tourists to the largest ones. The [[Camino de Santiago|Pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela]] is not so popular among Spaniards but it attracts many visitors too. Most if not all cities and towns celebrate a patron saint's festival or similar, no matter how small or known, which often includes [[procession]]s, [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the like but whose actual religious following is variable and sometimes merely nominal.&lt;ref name=atheist_participation&gt;{{cite web|url=https://verne.elpais.com/verne/2018/03/28/articulo/1522233919_158736.html|title=Jóvenes, ateos y cofrades |publisher= [[El País]] |date=2018-03-30 |accessdate=2018-04-08| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trend among Spanish believers is [[Religious syncretism|syncretism]], often defined as ''religión a la carta''.&lt;ref name=sync1&gt;{{cite news |last=Segurola |first=Santiago |date=21 September 2016 |title=Religión a la carta |trans-title=Religion à la carte |url=https://elpais.com/diario/2006/09/21/cultura/1158789601_850215.html |language=es |work=[[El País]] |location=Madrid |access-date=5 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''religion [[à la carte]]'', people mix popular Roman Catholic beliefs and traditions with their own [[World view|worldview]] and/or [[esoteric]], [[self-help]], [[New Age]] or [[Philosophy|philosophical]] borrowings they like, resulting in an unique personal 'soft' spirituality without any possible church.&lt;ref name=sync2&gt;{{cite news |author=Red Iberoamericana de Estudio de las Sectas |date=3 April 2013 |title=Monseñor Munilla: "hoy se llevan el sincretismo y el esoterismo como espiritualidad" |url=http://www.infocatolica.com/blog/infories.php/1304010647-monsenor-munilla-hoy-se-lleva |language=es |work=Infocatólica |access-date=5 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These people typically self-define themselves as Catholics, but they only attend church for christenings, funerals or weddings and are not actual followers. Unbelievers are, by definition, not syncretic or otherwise.
[[File:BasharatMosque1.jpg|left|thumb|100px|The [[Basharat Mosque]] in [[Pedro Abad]], of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], was the first mosque to be built in modern Spain.]]

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Islam in Spain}}
The recent waves of [[Immigration to Spain|immigration]], especially during and after the 1990s, have led to an increasing number of Muslims and Protestants. Nowadays, [[Islam in Spain|Islam]] is the second largest religion, but far behind Roman Catholicism and irreligion. A study made by ''Unión de comunidades islámicas de España'' showed that there were almost 1,900,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain in 2016 (4% of the total population.)&lt;ref name="politica.elpais.com"&gt;[http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/04/10/actualidad/1460313231_421587.html Los musulmanes aumentan en España en 300.000 en cinco años|España|EL PAÍS]&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from [[Morocco]] and other African countries. Almost 780,000 of them had Spanish nationality.&lt;ref name="politica.elpais.com"/&gt;

=== Protestantism ===
{{Main|Protestantism in Spain}}
[[Protestantism in Spain]] has also been boosted by immigration, but remains a small testimonial force among native Spaniards (1%). Spain has been seen as a ''graveyard for foreign missionaries'' (meaning lack of success) among Evangelical Protestants.&lt;ref name="LAM"/&gt; Protestant churches claim to have about 1,200,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferede.org/general.php?pag=estad#1|title=Información general - Datos estadísticos|trans-title=General information - Statistical data|language=es|publisher=Federation of Evangelical Religious Entities of Spain|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930083055/http://www.ferede.org/general.php?pag=estad|archivedate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwrn.org/articles/27149/|title=Protestants call for 'equal treatment'|work=[[El Pais]]|date=December 10, 2007|accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Jews in Spain}}
[[Jews in Spain]] account for less than 1 percent of the population, mostly in Barcelona, Madrid and Murcia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurojewcong.org/ejc/news.php?id_article=117|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301113502/http://www.eurojewcong.org/ejc/news.php?id_article=117|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-03-01|title=European Jewish Congress - Spain|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minor religions ===
[[File:Stupa de Benalmadena.jpg|thumb|The Buddhist [[Benalmádena Stupa]] opened in 2003 in [[Andalusia]] is considered the largest in Europe.]]
Besides various varieties of Christianity, Islam, Judaism and the non-religious, Spain also has small groups of [[Hinduism in Spain|Hindus]], Buddhists, Pagans, Taoists, and [[Bahá'í Faith in Spain|Bahá'ís]].

==== Buddhism ====
{{VT|Buddhism in Europe}}
[[Buddhism]] didn't arrive in Spain until the late 20th century. According to an estimation, there are around 65,000 followers and an indeterminate number of sympathizers. However, some of its teachings, like [[reincarnation]] or [[karma]], have partially syncretized with the cultural mainstream via [[New Age]]-style movements.

==== Paganism ====
[[File:Odinist wedding at the community's Temple of Gaut in Albacete.jpg|thumb|Heathen wedding at the temple of the [[Odinist Community of Spain — Ásatrú|OCSA]] in [[Albacete]].]]
Paganism is extremely minoritary in Spain. The most visible [[Neopaganism|Pagan]] religions are forms of [[Germanic Heathenism]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Etenismo''), [[Celtic neopaganism|Celtic paganism]] (and [[Druidry]]) and [[Wicca]]. Spanish Heathen groups include the [[Odinist Community of Spain — Ásatrú]], which identifies as both [[Odinism|Odinist]] and [[Ásatrú]], the [http://www.asatru-vanatru.com/ Asatru Lore Vanatru Assembly], the [http://www.fornsed.es/ Gotland Forn Sed] and [[Circulo Asatrú Tradición Hispánica]] of which four the first one is officially registered by the State; Celtist or Druidic groups include the [[Dun Ailline Druid Brotherhood]] (''Hermandad Druida Dun Ailline'') and the [http://www.ordendruidafintan.com/ Fintan Druidic Order], both registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spain.pagannewswirecollective.com/hermandad-druida-dun-ailline-registrada-como-entidad-religiosa/11524 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191920/http://spain.pagannewswirecollective.com/hermandad-druida-dun-ailline-registrada-como-entidad-religiosa/11524 |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the Wiccan groups, two have been granted official registration: the Spanish Wiccan Association (''Asociación Wicca España'') and the Celtiberian Wicca (''Wicca Tradición Celtíbera'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spain.pagannewswirecollective.com/confesion-religiosa-wicca-celtibera-registrada/01226 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629045743/http://spain.pagannewswirecollective.com/confesion-religiosa-wicca-celtibera-registrada/01226 |archivedate=2013-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] is a center of Druidry ([[Galician language|Galician]]: ''Druidaria'') due to its strong [[Celts|Celtic]] heritage; the [http://durvate.wordpress.com/ Pan-Galician Druidic Order] (Galician: ''Irmandade Druídica Galaica'') is specific to Galicia. In [[Basqueland]], traditional [[Basque mythology|Basque Gentility]] ([[Basque language|Basque]]: ''Jentiltasuna'') and Sorginkery (Basque: ''Sorginkeria''), Basque witchcraft, have been revived and have ties with [[Basque nationalism]]. ''Sorginkoba Elkartea'' is a Basque Neopagan organisation active in the Basque countries. 

All these communities, orders and brotherhoods are barely more than small scattered groups.

==== Taoism ====
[[Taoism]] has a presence in Spain, especially in [[Catalonia]]. Among Spanish people, it was introduced by the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] master Tian Chengyang in the 2000s, leading to the foundation of the [[Catalan Taoist Association]] (''Asociación de Taoísmo de Cataluña'') and the opening of the Temple of Purity and Silence (''Templo de la Pureza y el Silencio'') in [[Barcelona]], both in 2001. The association has planned to expand the Temple of Purity and Silence as a traditional Chinese Taoist templar complex, the first Taoist temple of this kind in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taoismo.es/primertemplotaoi.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612072212/http://taoismo.es/primertemplotaoi.html |archivedate=2013-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further [[:ca:Temple Taoista de Barcelona|Taoist temple]] was opened in 2014 by the Chinese community of [[Barcelona]], led by [[Taoist priest]] Liu Zemin, a 21st-generation descendant of poet, soldier and prophet Liu Bo Wen (1311-1375). The temple, located in the district of [[Sant Martí (district)|Sant Martí]] and inaugurated with the presence of the People's Republic of China consul Qu Chengwu, enshrines 28 [[Chinese gods and immortals|deities]] of the province of China where most of the Chinese in Barcelona come from.&lt;ref&gt;[http://governacio.gencat.cat/ca/detalls/Noticia/013_taoista "S'ha inaugurat un temple taoista a Barcelona"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928093534/http://governacio.gencat.cat/ca/detalls/Noticia/013_taoista |date=2017-09-28 }}.

==History==
[[Spain]], it has been observed, is a nation-state born out of religious struggle mainly between [[Catholicism]] and [[Islam]], but also against [[Judaism]] (and, to a lesser extent, [[Protestantism]]). The [[Reconquista]] against [[Al Andalus]] (ending in 1492), the establishment of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] (1478) and the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|expulsion of Jews]] (1492) were highly relevant in the union of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] under the ''[[Catholic Monarchs]]'' [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Fernando]] (1492), followed by the persecution and eventual [[expulsion of the Moriscos]] in 1609. The [[Counter-Reformation]] (1563–1648) was especially strong in Spain and the Inquisition was not definitively abolished until 1834, thus keeping Islam, Judaism, Protestantism and [[Enlightenment in Spain|parts of Enlightenment]] at bay for most of its history.

=== Antiquity and late Antiquity ===
{{VT|History of Early Christianity|History of the Catholic Church|Constantine the Great and Christianity|Visigothic Kingdom|Councils of Toledo}}
[[Image:Le Temple de Diane vue latérale et frontale.JPG|thumb|left|The rebuilt [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] temple of Diana in [[Emerita Augusta|Mérida]]]]
Before Christianity, there were multiple beliefs in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] including local [[Iberians|Iberian]], [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] religions, as well as the [[Hellenistic religion|Greco]]-[[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]].
 
According to [[Historia Compostelana|a medieval legend]], the [[James, son of Zebedee|apostle James]] was the first to spread Christianity in the [[Hispania|Roman Iberian Peninsula]]. There is no factual evidence of this but he later became the [[patron saint]] of Spaniards and Portuguese, originating the [[Camino de Santiago|Way of St James]]. According to [[Romans 15]], [[Paul the Apostle]] also intended to visit Hispania; tradition has that he did and founded the [[:es:Diócesis de Écija|Diocese of Écija]], but there is no evidence of this either. Other later myths include the [[Seven Apostolic Men]].

There is some archaeological evidence of Christianity slowly penetrating the Peninsula from Rome and [[Mauretania|Roman Mauretania]] via major cities and ports, especially [[Tarraco|Tarragona]], since the early [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]]. The [[:ca:Necròpolis paleocristiana de Tarragona|Paleo-Christian Necropolis of Tarragona]], with 2,050 discovered tombs, dates back to the second half of the 3rd century. Saints like [[Eulalia of Mérida]] or [[Eulalia of Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[:Category:Saints from Hispania|many others]] are believed to have been martyred during the [[Decian persecution|Decian]] or [[Diocletianic Persecution]]s ([[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd]]–early [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th]] centuries). [[Bishop]]s like [[:es:Basílides de Astorga|Basílides of Astorga]], [[:es:Marcial de Mérida|Marcial of Merida]] or the influential [[Hosius of Corduba]] were active in the same period. 

Eventually, [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]] (306–337) [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|converted the entire Roman Empire]] and Christianity was thus established as the only [[official religion]]. This Christianity was already an early form of Catholicism.
[[Image:SanPedroNave1.jpg|thumb|The 7th-century Visigothic church of [[San Pedro de la Nave]]]]
As [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] declined, [[Migration Period|Germanic tribes invaded]] most of the lands of the former empire. In the years following 410 the [[Visigoths]] –- who had converted to [[Arianism|Arian Christianity]] around 360 –- occupied what is now Spain and Portugal. The [[Visigoths#Visigothic kingdom in Hispania|Visigothic Kingdom]] established its capital in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]; it reached its high point during the reign of [[Leovigild]] (568-586). Visigothic rule led to a brief expansion of [[Arianism]] in Spain, however the native population remained staunchly Catholic.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 587 [[Reccared]], the Visigothic king at Toledo, converted to Catholicism  and launched a movement to unify doctrine. The Council of Lerida in 546 constrained the clergy and extended the power of law over them under the blessings of Rome. The multiple [[Councils of Toledo]] definitively established what would be later known as the Catholic Church in Spain and contributed to define Catholicism elsewhere.

=== Middle Ages ===
{{VT|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Al-Andalus|Reconquista}}
By the early 8th century, the Visigothic kingdom had fragmented and the fragments were in disarray, bankrupt and willing to accept external help to fight each other. In 711 an [[Arab]] raiding party led by [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]] crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], then defeated the Visigothic king [[Roderic]] at the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Tariq's commander, [[Musa bin Nusair]] then landed with substantial reinforcements. Taking advantage of the Visigoths' infighting, by 718 the Muslims dominated most of the peninsula, establishing Islamic rule until 1492. 
[[Image:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Great Mosque of Córdoba]] turned church after the [[Reconquista]].]]
During this period the number of Muslims increased greatly through the migration of Arabs and Berbers, and the conversion of local Christians to Islam (known as [[Muladi]]s or Muwalladun) with the latter forming the majority of the Islamic-ruled area by the end of the 10th century. Most Christians who remained adopted Arabic culture, and these Arabized Christians became known as [[Mozarabs]]. While under the status of ''[[dhimmi]]s'' the Christian and Jewish subjects had to pay higher taxes than Muslims and could not hold positions of power over Muslims.

The era of Muslim rule before 1055 is often considered a "Golden Age" for the Jews as Jewish intellectual and spiritual life flourished in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sephardim|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|author=Rebecca Weiner|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the northern fringes of the peninsula did Christians remain under Christian rule. Here they established the great pilgrimage centre of [[Santiago de Compostela]].

[[Spain in the Middle Ages|In the Middle Ages]], Spain saw a slow Christian re-conquest of [[Muslim Spain|Muslim territories]]. In 1147, when the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] took control of Muslim Andalusian territories, they reversed the earlier tolerant attitude and treated Christians harshly. Faced with the choice of death, conversion, or emigration, many [[Jews]] and Christians emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/IntergroupTO/JewishMuslim/Almohads.htm The Almohads] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213223723/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/IntergroupTO/JewishMuslim/Almohads.htm |date=2009-02-13 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity provided the cultural and religious cement that helped bind together those who rose up against the Moors and sought to drive them out. Christianity and the Catholic Church helped shape the re-establishment of European rule over Iberia.
[[File:01 Antequera, Andalusia, Spain.jpg|thumb|[[:es:Real Colegiata de Santa María la Mayor|Royal Collegiate Church of Santa María la Mayor]] in [[Antequera]], [[Andalusia]]]]
After centuries of the [[Reconquista]], in which Christian Spaniards fought to drive out the [[Moors|Muslims]], King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] established the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1478 to complete the religious purification of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from Muslim and Jewish thought and practice. [[Emirate of Granada|Granada]], the last Muslim redoubt, was eventually reconquered on January 2, 1492 —781 years after Tariq's first landing.

=== Modern period ===
In the Early Modern Period, Spain saw itself as the bulwark of Catholicism and doctrinal purity. Spain carried Catholicism to the New World and to the Philippines, but the Spanish kings insisted on independence from papal "interference" - bishops in the Spanish domains were forbidden to report to the Pope except through the Spanish crown. In the 18th century Spanish rulers drew further from the papacy, banishing the [[Jesuits]] from their empire in 1767. The Spanish authorities abolished the Inquisition in the 1830s, but even after that, [[religious freedom]] was denied in practice, if not in theory.

=== Concordat of 1851 ===
Catholicism became the state religion in 1851, when the Spanish government signed a [[Concordat]] with the [[Holy See]] that committed [[Madrid]] to pay the salaries of the clergy and to subsidize other expenses of the Roman Catholic Church as a compensation for the seizure of church property in the ''[[Desamortización de Mendizábal]]'' of 1835-1837. This pact was renounced in 1931, when the secular constitution of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] imposed a series of anticlerical measures that threatened the Church's hegemony in Spain, provoking the Church's support for the [[Francisco Franco]] uprising five years later.&lt;ref name="LOCprof2"&gt;Text used in this cited section originally came from: [http://rs6.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html Spain Country Study] from the [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] project.
&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], alleged Communists and Anarchists in Republican areas killed about [[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|7,000 priests]].

===Under Franco===
{{Main|National Catholicism}}
[[Image:Francisco Franco en la iglesia de Santa María durante la celebración de la Salve (4 de 9) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Dictator Francisco Franco and his wife attending mass.]]
The advent of the [[Spain under Franco|Franco regime]] saw the restoration of the church's privileges under a [[totalitarian]] system known as ''[[National Catholicism]]''. During the Franco years, Roman Catholicism was the only religion to have legal status; other worship services could not be advertised, and no other religion could own property or publish books. The Government not only continued to pay priests' salaries and to subsidize the Church, it also assisted in the reconstruction of church buildings damaged by the war. Laws were passed abolishing divorce and civil marriages as well as banning abortion and the sale of contraceptives. Homosexuality and all other forms of sexual permissiveness were also banned.  Catholic religious instruction was mandatory, even in public schools. Franco secured in return the right to name Roman Catholic bishops in Spain, as well as veto power over appointments of clergy down to the parish priest level. 

In 1953 this close cooperation was formalized in a [[Concordat of 1953|new Concordat]] with the Vatican that granted the church an extraordinary set of privileges: mandatory canonical marriages for all Catholics; exemption from government taxation; subsidies for new building construction; censorship of materials the Church deemed offensive; the right to establish universities, to operate radio stations, and to publish newspapers and magazines; protection from police intrusion into church properties; and exemption of military service.&lt;ref name="LOCprof" /&gt;

The proclamation of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in favor of religious freedom in 1965 provided more rights to other religious denominations in Spain. In the late 1960s, the Vatican attempted to reform the Church in Spain by appointing interim, or acting, bishops, thereby circumventing Franco's stranglehold on the country's clergy. Many young priests, under foreign influence, became [[worker priest]]s and participated in anti-regime agitation. Many of them ended as leftist politicians, with some imprisoned in the [[Concordat prison]] reserved for priest prisoners. In 1966, the Franco regime passed a law that freed other religions from many of the earlier restrictions, but the law also reaffirmed the privileges of the Catholic Church. Any attempt to revise the 1953 Concordat met Franco's rigid resistance.&lt;ref name="LOCprof" /&gt;

===Separation of church and state since 1978===
[[Image:Vicente Enrique y Tarancón.jpg|thumb|left|Cardinal [[Vicente Enrique y Tarancón]] adopted a democratic stance and was decisive in separating church from state in Spain.&lt;ref name=tarancon1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2007/11/20/sociedad/1195513202_850215.html|title=El cardenal Tarancón lo intentó en 1971 |publisher= [[El País]] |date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2018-04-08| quote=Sin Tarancón y su grupo de colaboradores, apoyados en todo momento por el papa Pablo VI, la transición desde el nacionalcatolicismo hacia la democracia hubiera sido imposible. | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he received continuous death threats from hardline Francoists, including far-right Catholics, until democracy was well established; "¡Tarancón al paredón!" ''(Tarancón to the execution wall!)'' was a common slogan.&lt;ref name=tarancon2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2012/01/22/domingo/1327207955_850215.html|title=La rabia de Tarancón |publisher= [[El País]] |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2018-04-08| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tarancon3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2007/09/13/sociedad/1189634413_850215.html|title=El cardenal que hizo llorar a Franco |publisher= [[El País]] |date=2012-01-22 |accessdate=2018-04-08| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1976, however, King [[Juan Carlos de Borbon]] unilaterally renounced the right to name the bishops; later that year, Madrid and the Vatican signed a new accord that restored to the church its right to name bishops, and the Church agreed to a revised Concordat that entailed a gradual financial [[separation of church and state]]. Church property not used for religious purposes was henceforth to be subject to taxation, and over a period of years, the Church's reliance on state subsidies was to be gradually reduced. The timetable for this reduction was not adhered to, however, and the church continued to receive the public subsidy through 1987 (US$110 million in that year alone).&lt;ref name="LOCprof" /&gt;

It took the new [[1978 Spanish Constitution]] to confirm the right of Spaniards to religious freedom and to begin the process of disestablishing Catholicism as the state religion. The drafters of the Constitution tried to deal with the intense controversy surrounding state support of the Church, but they were not entirely successful. The initial draft of the Constitution did not even mention the Church, which was included almost as an afterthought and only after intense pressure from the church's leadership. Article 16 disestablishes Roman Catholicism as the official religion and provides that religious liberty for non-Catholics is a state-protected legal right, thereby replacing the policy of limited toleration of non-Catholic religious practices. The article further states, however, that "The public authorities shall take the religious beliefs of Spanish society into account and shall maintain the consequent relations of cooperation with the Catholic Church and the other confessions." In addition, Article 27 also aroused controversy by appearing to pledge continuing government subsidies for private, Church-affiliated schools. These schools were sharply criticized by Spanish Socialists for having created and perpetuated a class-based, separate, and unequal school system. The Constitution, however, includes no affirmation that the majority of Spaniards are Catholics or that the state should take into account the teachings of Catholicism.&lt;ref name="LOCprof" /&gt; The Constitution declares Spain a "non-confessional" state, however it is not a ''[[laïque]]'' state like [[Catholic Church in France|France]] or [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Mexico]].

Government financial aid to the Catholic Church was a difficult and contentious issue. The Church argued that, in return for the subsidy, the state had received the social, health, and educational services of tens of thousands of priests and nuns who fulfilled vital functions that the state itself could not have performed at that time. Nevertheless, the revised Concordat was supposed to replace direct state aid to the church with a scheme that would allow taxpayers to designate a certain portion of their taxes to be diverted directly to the Church. Through 1985, taxpayers were allowed to deduct up to 10 percent from their taxable income for donations to the Catholic Church. Partly because of the protests against this arrangement from representatives of Spain's other religious groups and even some from the catholic religion itself, the tax laws were changed in 2007 so that taxpayers could choose between giving 0.52 percent of their income tax to the church and allocating it to the government's welfare and culture budgets. For three years, the government would continue to give the Church a gradually reduced subsidy, but after that the church would have to subsist on its own resources. The government would continue, however, its program of subsidizing Catholic schools, which in 1987 cost the Spanish taxpayers about US$300 million, exclusive of the salaries of teachers, which were paid directly by the Ministry of Education and Science.&lt;ref name="LOCprof" /&gt;

In a population of about 39 million at the beginning of [[Spanish transition to democracy|Transition]], the number of non-Catholics was probably no more than 300,000. About 290,000 of these were of other Christian faiths, including several Protestant denominations, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Spain|Mormons]]. The number of Jews in Spain was estimated at about 13,000
[[Murcia Jewish community]]. More than 19 out of every 20 Spaniards were baptized Catholics; about 60 percent of them attended Mass; about 30 percent of the baptized Catholics did so regularly, although this figure declined to about 20 percent in the larger cities. In 1979, about 97 percent of all marriages were performed according to the Catholic rite. A 1982 report by the church claimed that 82 percent of all children born the preceding year had been baptized in the church.&lt;ref name="LOCprof" /&gt;

Nevertheless, there were forces at work bringing about fundamental changes in the place of the church in society. One such force was the improvement in the economic fortunes of the great majority of Spaniards, making society more [[materialistic]] and less religious. Another force was the massive shift in population from farm and village to the growing urban centers, where the church had less influence over the values of its members. These changes were transforming the way Spaniards defined their religious identity.&lt;ref name="LOCprof" /&gt;

Being a Catholic in Spain had less and less to do with regular attendance at [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] and more to do with the routine observance of important rituals such as baptism, marriage, and burial of the dead. A 1980 survey revealed that, although 82 percent of Spaniards were believers in Catholicism, very few considered themselves to be very good practitioners of the faith. In the case of the youth of the country, even smaller percentages believed themselves to be "very good" or "practicing" Catholics.&lt;ref name="LOCprof" /&gt;

In contrast to an earlier era, when rejection of the church went along with education, in the late 1980s studies showed that the more educated a person was, the more likely he or she was to be a practicing Catholic. This new acceptance of the church was due partly to the church's new self-restraint in politics. In a significant change from the pre-Civil War era, the church had accepted the need for the separation of religion and the state, and it had even discouraged the creation of a Christian Democratic party in the country.&lt;ref name="LOCprof" /&gt;
[[Image:Presidente de España Rodríguez Zapatero en el Senado en marzo de 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], an openly agnostic&lt;ref name=ZAPATERO&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2008/06/29/domingo/1214711557_850215.html|title="'Miembras' abrió el debate. Y eso vale para luchar por la igualdad" |publisher= [[El País]] | quote=Yo siempre me he declarado agnóstico (...) tengo una visión laica de la sociedad|date=2008-06-29 |accessdate=2018-04-08| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of Spain]] who was elected twice in 2004 and 2008.]]
The traditional links between the political right and the church no longer dictated political preferences; in the [[Spanish general election, 1982|1982 general election]], more than half of the country's practicing Catholics voted for the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]. Although the Socialist leadership professed [[agnosticism]], according to surveys between 40 and 45 percent of the party's rank-and-file members held religious beliefs, and more than 70 percent of these professed to be Catholics. Among those entering the party after Franco's death, about half considered themselves Catholic.&lt;ref name="LOCprof" /&gt;

One important indicator of the changes taking place in the role of the church was the reduction in the number of Spaniards in Holy Orders. In 1984 the country had more than 22,000 parish priests, nearly 10,000 ordained monks, and nearly 75,000 nuns. These numbers concealed a troubling reality, however. More than 70 percent of the diocesan clergy was between the ages of 35 and 65; the average age of the clergy in 1982 was 49 years. At the upper end of the age range, the low numbers reflected the impact of the Civil War, in which more than 4,000 parish priests died. At the lower end, the scarcity of younger priests reflected the general crisis in vocations throughout the world, which began to be felt in the 1960s. Its effects were felt especially acutely in Spain. The crisis was seen in the decline in the number of young men joining the priesthood and in the increase in the number of priests leaving Holy Orders. The number of [[Seminary|seminarists]] in Spain fell from more than 9,000 in the 1950s to only 1,500 in 1979, even though it rose slightly in 1982 to about 1,700.&lt;ref name="LOCprof" /&gt; In 2008, there were just 1,221 students in these theological schools.&lt;ref name=SEMINARISTAS09&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conferenciaepiscopal.es/seminarios/2009/Estadisticas.pdf|title=Estadísticas "Día del Seminario" 2009, Conferencia Episcopal Española|accessdate=2009-03-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530002400/http://www.conferenciaepiscopal.es/seminarios/2009/Estadisticas.pdf|archivedate=2009-05-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the social meaning of religious vocations were perhaps part of the problem; having a priest in the family no longer seemed to spark the kind of pride that family members would have felt in the past. The principal reason in most cases, though, was the church's continued ban on marriage for priests. Previously, the crisis was not particularly serious because of the age distribution of the clergy. As the twentieth century neared an end, however, a serious imbalance appeared between those entering the priesthood and those leaving it. The effects of this crisis were already visible in the decline in the number of parish priests in Spain—from 23,620 in 1979 to just over 22,000 by 1983&lt;ref name="LOCprof" /&gt; and 19,307 in 2005.&lt;ref name="ESTADISTICA2005" /&gt; New ordinations also dropped 19% from 241 in 1998 to 196 in 2008, with all-time record lows of 168 priests out of 45 million Spaniards taking their vows in 2007.&lt;ref name="SEMINARISTAS09" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ESTADISTICA2007&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastoral-vocacional.org/acontecimientos_vocacionales/estadis2007MA.html|title=Acontecimientos Vocacionales, estadística de seminarios mayores 2007.

Another sign of the church's declining role in Spanish life was the diminishing importance of the controversial secular religious institute, [[Opus Dei and politics|Opus Dei]] (Work of God). Opus Dei, a worldwide lay religious body, did not adhere to any particular political philosophy. Its founder, [[Jose Maria Escriva de Balaguer y Albas]], stated that the organization was nonpolitical. The organization was founded in 1928 as a reaction to the increasing secularization of Spain's universities, and higher education continued to be one of the institute's foremost priorities. Despite its public commitment to a nonpolitical stance, Opus Dei members rose to occupy key positions in the Franco régime, especially in the field of economic policy-making in the late 1950s and the early 1960s. Opus Dei members dominated the group of liberal technocrats who engineered the opening of Spain's [[Autarky|autarchic economy]] after 1957. After the 1973 assassination of Prime Minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] (often rumored to be an Opus Dei member), however, the influence of the institute declined sharply. The secrecy of the order and its activities and the power of its myth helped it maintain its strong position of influence in Spain; but there was little doubt that, compared with the 1950s and the 1960s, Opus Dei had fallen from being one of the country's chief political organizations to being simply one among many such groups competing for power in an open and pluralist society.&lt;ref name=LOCprof&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solsten |first1=Eric |last2=Meditz |first2=Sandra |date=1990 |title=Spain: A Country Study |url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/frdcstdy.spaincountrystud00sols_0/ |location= |publisher=United States [[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division |page=115 |isbn=9780160285509 |lccn=90006127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===

An important number of Latin American immigrants, who are usually strong Catholic practitioners, have helped the Catholic Church to recover part of the attendance that regular Masses (Sunday Mass) used to have in the sixties and seventies and that was lost in the eighties among native Spaniards.

Since 2003, the involvement of the Catholic Church in political affairs, through special groups such as [[Opus Dei]], the [[Neocatechumenal Way]] or the [[Legion of Christ]], especially personated through important politicians in the right-wing People's Party, has increased again. Old and new media, which are property of the Church, such as the [[Cadena COPE|COPE]] radio network or [[:es:Trece (canal de televisión)|13 TV]], have also contributed to this new involvement in politics by their own admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Un informe de la Iglesia califica a 13TV de "culturalmente pobre", afín al PP y para "la tercera edad"|url=http://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/encargado-denuncia-television-eminentemente-definida_0_518998732.html|accessdate=15 November 2017|publisher = eldiario.es|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bluper.elespanol.com/noticias/iglesia-califica-13tv-afin-pp-culturalmente-pobre|title=La Iglesia califica a 13 TV como afín al PP y para "la tercera edad" {{!}} Bluper|accessdate=15 November 2017|publisher = bluper.elespanol.com|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church is no longer seen as a neutral and independent institution in political affairs and it is generally aligned with the opinion and politics of the People's Party. This implication has had, as a consequence, a renewed criticism from important sectors of the population (especially the majority of left-wing voters) against the Church and the way in which it is economically sustained by the State. While by 2017-2018 the Church was slowly backpedalling, the damage is potentially long-lasting among the younger generations who had not experienced it personally in such degree.

The total number of [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|parish priests]] shrank from 24,300 in 1975 to 18,500 in 2018, with an average age of 65.5 years.&lt;ref name=INFOCAT2018&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=La edad media del clero español es de 65 años y medio |url=http://www.infocatolica.com/?t=noticia&amp;cod=31729 |work=Infocatólica |date=2018-03-01 |access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of [[nun]]s dropped by 44.5% to 32,270 between 2000 and 2016; most of them are old.&lt;ref name=ESTADISTICA2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csviator.es/revista/424/ESTADISTICA-IGLESIA-ESPA%C3%91A.pdf|title=Estadísticas de la Iglesia en España, 2005|accessdate=2007-05-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220210049/http://www.csviator.es/revista/424/ESTADISTICA-IGLESIA-ESPA%C3%91A.pdf|archivedate=2009-12-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LV2016&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Cae un 3,5% el número de religiosos en España hasta los 42.921, durante el Año de la Vida Consagrada |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20160201/301827339303/cae-un-3-5-el-numero-de-religiosos-en-espana-hasta-los-42-921-durante-el-ano-de-la-vida-consagrada.html |work=[[La Vanguardia]] |date=2016-02-01 |access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, some expressions of popular religiosity still thrive, often linked to local festivals, and about 68.5% of the population self-defined themselves as Catholics in 2018, but just 39.8% of them (27.3% of the total population) attend Mass monthly or more often.&lt;ref name=CIS2018 /&gt; Despite [[Immigration to Spain|the arrival of large numbers]] of Catholic, Orthodox, Muslim and Protestant immigrants, [[Irreligion in Spain|irreligion]] continues to be the fastest growing demographic {{as of|2018|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=INFOCAT2018_ateos&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=España, cada vez menos católica, cada vez más incrédula y atea |url=http://www.infocatolica.com/?t=noticia&amp;cod=31571 |work=Infocatólica |date=2018-02-08 |access-date=2018-04-08 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2248">The '''sellisternium''' or  ''solisternium'' was a ritual banquet for [[goddess]]es in the [[Ancient Roman religion]]. It was based on a variant of the  Greek ''theoxenias'', and was considered an appropriately [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ritus graecus|"greek" form of rite]] for some Roman goddesses thought to have been originally Greek, or with clearly Greek counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Scheid|Scheid, John]], in Rüpke, Jörg (Editor), A Companion to Roman Religion, Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p.226. The sellistrenium and various other elements of ritus Graecus, "proved Rome’s profound religious and cultural rooting in the Greek world."&lt;/ref&gt; In the traditional Roman [[lectisternium]], the images of attending deities, usually male, reclined on couches along with their male hosts or guests. In the sellisternium, the attending goddesses sat on chairs or benches (in Latin, ''sellae''), usually in the company of exclusively female hosts and guests.&lt;ref&gt;Linderski, Jerzy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7116">Shakumbhri Devi temple is one of the famous shakthi peeth temple in India.According to mythology lord Brahma performed a yagna to sacrifice shiva and shakthi. Goddess shakthi arise separately from shiva and helped brahma for creating the universe. After completing the  work brahma decided to give shakthi to shiva. At that time his son dhaksha performed many yaganas to get shakthi as his daughter in the form of sati and  planned to marry sati to shiva after getting into the world. But due to shivas curse to brahma was that his fifth head was cut off due to his lie in front of shiva.by this incident dhaksha got angry on shiva and decided not to let sati and shiva get married. However sati got attarcted by shiva and got married. So dhaksha performed a yagna to take revenge on lord shiva.For that yagna he invites all the deities except lord shiva so sati got angry and fallen into the yagna.By the insult of dhaksha towards shiva,Shiva in virabhadra avatar destroyed dhakshas yagna and also cut the dhakshas head and later replaced it by the male goat head.

== Mythology ==
It is said that, at this place, Mother Goddess Shakumbhri killed  the mighty demon king (Maha Daitya) [[Mahishasura]].  It is also believed that, here she performed worship and meditation ([[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]) for 100 years, having a [[vegetarian]] meal (shaka-ahar) only once at the end of every month.  During  this  time, the  saints and seers ([[Rishi]]s/[[Monk|Muni]]s) who came for her worship ([[Darśana|Darshan]]) were  welcomed and honoured with vegetarian meals. Because of this the  temple was named the  '''Shakumbhri Devi''' temple and she also got very strongly connected with the cult of [[vegetarianism]] among [[Hindu]]s.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Temples of Shakumbhri Devi==

=== Sikar District Rajasthan===

The temple is considered as one of the more ancient temples of maa sakumbhari and the idol considered [[swayambhu]] (appeared naturally). the temple is close to the town of udaipur shekhavati and in sikar district. The temple holds colourful navratras festival and there is an ancient mutt or [[Shakti peetha|shaktipeeth]].

===Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh===

[[File:Sdevi.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Shakumbhri Devi Temple]]

The temple is on the site of the ruins of a more ancient temple and was constructed by the [[Pundir]] Rajputs under [[Rana Bahadur Singh Pundir]] who was the representative of the [[Pundir]] chief [[Rana Pitambar Singh Pundir]] of Jasmour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xKugAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=jusmore+rana&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rK_MTNGMNsOBlAftgrzmCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=jusmore%20rana&amp;f=false Calcutta Review, Volume 2; Volume 58 .]&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is not an ancient temple, its devotees consider it to be a [[Shakti Peetha]], a powerful seat of [[Shakti]], the divine feminine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india9.com/i9show/Shakumbari-Devi-Temple-37440.htm Shakumbari Devi Temple at India9]&lt;/ref&gt;
The devotees have a strong faith in the Goddess and the  temple attracts a large number of devotees  from India as also from outside the country particularly during the Navratree days. The temple is well maintained and is well laid out to have full  darshan of the idols in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. It is found from the plaque displayed near the staircase  that it was during the early 1960s that a properly covered corridor, connecting  the main entrance gate and outer varandah of the temple, was constructed for the convenience and comfort of the devotees. This work was done, with the permission of the Ranas of Jasmour who own the temple, by one Shri Radha Kishan,then Treasurer of the erstwhile Kalsia State (Chhachhrauli)(presently in Yamunanagar District of Haryana)from his personal contribution and also  by collecting donations from several devotees.It is indeed an experience of life to visit the main temple as also the nearby  Bhuradev Temple seeking their blessings and benedictions.It is rightly said that a visit to these temples with faith and devotion always brings great satisfaction, rewards and contentment in life and family.These temples are easily approachable by road or train from different parts of the country and their location is surrounded by hills and serene environment.

===Sambhar Lake, Rajasthan===
Another shrine dedicated to Shakumbari Devi is near the famous [[Sambhar Lake]], 90 kilometers west of [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sambharlake.tripod.com/ Sambhar Lake]&lt;/ref&gt; This temple is quite ancient and popular estimates put the age of this temple at 1300 years or more.

According to a [[Hindu]] tradition, Shakumbhari Devi - tutelary [[Goddess]] of [[Pundir]],{{cn|date=March 2018}} Audichya Brahmins,{{cn|date=March 2018}} [Joshi,{{cn|date=March 2018}} [[Chauhan]] and - converted forest to a plain of precious metals. When people worried and felt it as curse rather than blessing, and requested her to retract her favor, she converted the silver to salt, now found in the lake.

===Other associations===

Another temple that finds its association with Shakumbhari Devi is ''Jeen-Maa temple'', near Goriya, [[Sikar]], [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://shrijeenmaa.org/history%20of%20mata.htm History of Jeen Mata] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117222400/http://shrijeenmaa.org/history%20of%20mata.htm |date=2008-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; JAI MATA SHAKUMBHRI DEVI KI JAI

== Shakumbhri Devi Melas ==
Twice a year, in the [[Ashwin (BanglaMonth)|Ashwin]] and [[Chaitra]] months of the Hindu calendar (during the days of Navratra),as also at the time of Holi festival, the famous Shakumbhri melas are  organised.It is during these melas, in  particular, that the roads from Saharanpur(U.P.) to the Temple are properly maintained so as to facilitate to and fro smooth journey for the devotees. The devotees to Shakumbhri first visit Bhura-Dev temple which is about one kilometer before the Temple and then proceed to the Temple of the Goddess.

The popularity of this temple has been increasing day by day and many devotees from far and near visit this temple for "Darshan" these days. During this famous [[Mela|melas]], [[lakhs]] of [[Hindu]] devotees  visit this temple for [[Darśana|darshan]]. It is indeed considered to be a rewarding experience to visit the Temple with devotion and faith in the munificence of the Goddess.

==Films on Shakumbhri Devi==

Jai Shakumbari Maa (2000) produced and directed by Shiv Kumar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b4umovie.com/shop/product.php?productid=16491 Jai Shakumbari Maa Film]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pissarro - La cueillette des pois.jpg|thumb|''Picking Peas'', Camille Pissarro, gouache, 1887. Part of the Bauer collection recovered in France in 2017.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;]]

'''Simon Bauer''' (1862–1947) was a Jewish businessman in France and a collector of Impressionist art. His collection was stolen by the Vichy government in October 1943. While some works have been recovered, most are still missing. The Simon Bauer collection included 93 works from the [[Impressionism|Impressionist movement]]. Since the [[liberation of France]], some of the canvases have reappeared at auctions or exhibitions in museums.

==Early life==
Simon Bauer was born in 1862 to a humble background. He made a fortune in the footwear business, selling his holdings at the age of 40, at which point he began to travel the world to make up for his lack of education.&lt;ref name=20mins/&gt;

==Art collection==
According to the inventory taken at the time of its appropriation on 10 October 1943, Bauer's art collection comprised more than 90 works that included eleven by [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], four by [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], four by [[Eugène Boudin|Boudin]], and one each by [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] and [[Berthe Morisot]]. The sale was entrusted to a merchant designated by the General Commissariat for Jewish Affairs ({{Lang-fr|Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives}}).

The following year, in the summer of 1944, Bauer was interned at the [[Drancy internment camp]] but saved from deportation and likely death by a railway strike.&lt;ref name=20mins/&gt; He was released in September 1944 and tried to recover the paintings that had been stolen from him, but with little success. Some of them{{Which one|date=January 2018}} are kept in the Jeu de Paume museum in Paris, but most have disappeared.

==Death and legacy==
Bauer died in 1947. His grandson, Jean-Jacques Bauer, has attempted to recover his grandfather's paintings. In 1965, he managed to locate two Pissarros but could not get restitution. In 2013, the "treasure of Munich" was found in the hoard held by [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]]. In May 2017, Pissarro's ''Picking Peas'' (1887) was discovered at the [[Musée Marmottan Monet]] to whom it had been lent by [[Bruce Toll|Bruce and Robbi Toll]], Jewish-American art collectors, for an exhibition. They had bought the painting in good faith for $800,000 at [[Christie's]] New York in 1995. A French court ordered the painting's restitution to the Bauer family without compensation to the Tolls.&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Art collectors ordered to give back looted painting", Adam Sage, ''The Times'', 8 November 2017, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20mins&gt;[http://www.20minutes.fr/paris/2063047-20170506-toile-pissarro-spoliee-pendant-seconde-guerre-mondiale-reapparait-musee-paris Une toile de Pissarro spoliée pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale réapparaît dans un musée à Paris.] 20minutes.fr AFP, 2017.

Three miracles at Bellingham, connected with the mediaeval cult of St Cuthbert, are recorded in the twelfth century ''Libellus''&lt;ref&gt;"Little Book of Miracles of the Blessed Cuthbert Performed in Recent Times"&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Reginald of Durham]]. They concern  Sproich, a poor but pious man employed as a bridge-builder by the [[Almoner]] of [[Durham, England|Durham]].In the first miracle, after Sproich's daughter Eda stays away from church to sew a dress on the feast day of [[St Lawrence]], her left hand becomes paralysed, clutching the dress. She is miraculously cured by an apparition of St Cuthbert after drinking water from the well. In the second, on the occasion of Eda's marriage, Sproich's cow is seized in payment by a bailiff of the local lord and placed with another tenant. whose house is later struck by lightning. The cow is miraculously spared. In the third, a thief called Walter  of Flanders and his accomplice, who have stolen Sproich's axe, are fatally attacked by the head and the handle of the axe.

The well, in a lane next to St Cuthbert's Church, is now directed through a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[Waterway|conduit]], known locally as a ''pant''. The water is still used for baptisms. According to local tradition St Cuthbert originally discovered the source of the well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bord|Bord|1986|pp=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the miracle on [[Farne Islands|Farne]] of Cuthbert producing water from dry land by his prayers, see {{harvtxt|Colgrave|1940|pp=217–219}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Throne Hall of Dongola''', also known as the '''Mosque Building''', is an archaeological site in [[Old Dongola]], [[Sudan]]. It is a two-storey [[brick]] building situated on a rocky hill, overlooking the town and the [[Nile]] valley. It was originally built in the 9th century, serving as the richly adorned representative building of the [[Makuria]]n kings. In 1317, during the period of Makurian decline, it was converted into a [[mosque]], serving this puprose until it was closed and turned into a historic monument in 1969. Shortly afterwards [[Poland|Polish]] archaeologists began to excavate the building. It has been described as possibly "the most important, symbolic edifice in the [[History of Sudan#Medieval Nubia (c. 350–1500)|medieval history of Sudan]]".{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=248}} It is also the oldest Sudanese mosque still standing.

==History==
===Makurian Throne Hall (9th century–1317)===
[[File:Mary, Christ Child and date tree (Old Dongola).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Worn out painting from the central hall on the upper floor, showing Virgin Mary and the Christ Child. The latter is reaching out towards a date tree.]]
From the late 5th century [[Old Dongola]] ([[Old Nubian]]: ''Tungul'') was to be the capital of the [[Nubians|Nubian]] kingdom of [[Makuria]], which converted to [[Christianity]] in the mid-6th century{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=7}} and successfully defended its independence from the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic onslaught]] in the 7th century.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=68–70}} Between the 9th and 11th centuries the town enjoyed a [[golden age]]. In the 9th century, several representative buildings were constructed, among them the Throne Hall.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|pp=11–12}} It was probably built in the first half of the century, during the reign of King [[Georgios I of Makuria|Georgios I]] ({{reign|835|887}}){{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=252}} and his father [[Zakharias II of Makuria|Zakharias II]] ({{reign|835|857}}).{{efn|name=fn1|Zakharias II had seized the throne in 835. In the same year he crowned his son Georgios I king before dispatching him on a diplomatic mission to [[Baghdad]], probably to increase his prestige. After the death of Zakharias II in 857 his son became the sole ruler.{{sfn|Werner|2013|pp=89–92}}}} It was located on a rocky outcrop{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=12}} in the eastern part of the city. From this prominence the two-storey{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=257}} building enjoyed an extensive view of the town and the [[Nile]].{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=12}} Its purpose has been interpreted differently over the years, ranging from church, monastery and royal castle. However, its internal design suggests that the building had an official, non-residential purpose, and that it was intended to impress visitors.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=47}} The actual throne hall was on the upper floor,{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=12}} which official delegations and processions reached by ascending a monumental staircase.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=43}} Both the throne hall and the staircase were adorned with wall paintings.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=12}} During the 11th–12th centuries they were altered.{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=252}}

From 1265 Makuria endured repeated invasions by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk sultanate]], which, from 1276, usually installed a puppet king on the Makurian throne.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=243–247}} At the end of the 13th century, after yet another confrontation with the Mamluks, the most prestigious buildings of Old Dongola, among them the Throne Hall, lay in ruins and the population had dropped drastically due to deportations.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=135}} The Throne Hall in particular had both its south and northwest devastated. Shortly after the damage was inflicted, at the turn of the 13th century, the building was repaired, although not in its entirety and with various modifications.{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=252}}
&lt;!--{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=135}}--&gt;

===Mosque (1317–1969)===
In 1316 the Mamluks intervended into the Makurian affairs once more, intending to install prince [[Barshambu of Makuria|Barshambu]] on the throne. In contrast to the kings before him, he was a Muslim.{{sfn|Hasan|1967|pp=118–119}} On May 29, 1317 he converted the Throne Hall into a [[mosque]], as is confirmed by a marble inscription.{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=138}} Alterations to the building, especially in the central hall on the upper floor, were made according to its new function, such as the inclusion of a [[mihrab]] and the application of plaster over the Christian wall paintings.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=137}} Barshambu was not popular among his subjects due to his attitude and his reforms;{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=247}} Nubiologist [[Wlodziemierz Godlewski]] postulates that the conversion of the Throne Hall might have played its part in his fall.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=137}} He was eventually murderded by his own followers in the same year.{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=138}} After his death Makuria was ruled by both Muslim and Christian kings.{{sfn|Werner|2013|pp=138–141}} None of them dared to restore the former function of the building, as the Mamluk sultans supported its new function.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=137}}
[[File:Throne Hall of Dongola, 1821.jpg|thumb|The mosque in 1821]]

A civil war caused the destruction of Old Dongola in 1365. The Makurian kings fled to [[Lower Nubia]] in the north, where they would maintain themselves for approximately 150 years. Old Dongola, abandoned by Makuria, came under the control of the Arabic [[Banu Ja'd]] tribe{{sfn|Werner|2013|pp=143–145}} and eventually a new political entity, the so-called "[[Kingdom of Dongola Town]]",{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=135}} which was incorporated into the [[Funj sultanate]] during the early-16th century.{{sfn|O'Fahey|Spaulding|1974|pp=26–28}} The building is recorded to have served as a residence for [[Hajj|Mecca pilgrims]].{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=137}} However, during the 17th–19th centuries the ground floor was probably inacessable.
In the second half of the 18th century a local [[sheikh]] is recorded to have renovated the mosque extensively.{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=263}}

From the early 19th century the building was repeatedly described by western travellers and researchers.{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=250}} In the late-19th century Old Dongola was abandoned, probably for economic reasons, but the mosque remained in use.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=13}} In 1906 it was extensively documented for the first time. One year later it received another restoration; numerous others conducted by the [[Sudan Antiquities Service]] and various museums followed in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=263}} It was the oldest Sudanese mosque still standing{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=248}} and was finally closed as a place of worship in 1969.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=13}}

===Historic site (1969–present)===
After the salvage excavation of [[Faras Cathedral]], [[Poland|Polish]] archaeologists turned their attention to Old Dongola, where they started digging from 1964.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=14}} Between 1970 and 1983 they excavated the Throne Hall and documented its architecture and wall paintings.{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=251}}

It is intended that the Old Dongola site be transformed into an archaeological park. The construction of a steel roof is planned, providing protection and forming a stabilizing framework.{{sfn|Tarczewski|Dziedzic|2015|pp=230–231}} From 2018 to 2023 Old Dongola will be the subject of a large, multidisciplinary project researching the transformations that occurred between the 14th and early-19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212336_de.html |year=2017 |title=Urban Metamorphosis of the community of a Medieval African capital city |access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The Throne Hall was inspired by [[Byzantine architecture]], providing a testament to the Makurian attachment to [[Byzantine culture]].{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=12}} Very similar audience halls are known from the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], imitating, albeit on a smaller scale, those of [[Constantinople]].{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=47}} The Throne Hall, measuring 12m (39ft) in height, 28m (92ft) in length and 18m (59ft) in width,{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=248}} was built of mud bricks, red (fired) bricks and sandstone.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013|p=43}}&lt;!--It is likely that the central part of the roof used to have a cruciform augmentation including a small dome.{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=260}} Both were abandoned after the reconstruction in the late 13th century, giving it the flat shape it has today.{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=252}}--&gt;

==Wall paintings==
[[File:Magi, Dongola Throne Hall (Sudan).jpg|thumb|Detail of a painting from the central hall, showing a [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] on horseback.]]
The wall paintings in the Throne Hall have suffered damage from rain water, termites and bats.{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=257}} They are located at the staircase and in the central hall and show influences by Byzantine models.{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|p=270}} The walls of the staircase had two layers of painted plaster, showing [[Archangel Michael]] wielding a spear, two warrior saints (one on foot and one on horseback) as well as several unidentifiable standing figures.{{sfn|Obłuski|Godlewski|Kołątaj|Medeksza|2013|pp=257, 259}}

The central hall also had multiple layers of painted plaster, the amount varying from wall to wall.{{sfn|Zielinska|2015|p=25}} Its east wall housed a large nativity scene featuring the [[Virgin Mary]] lying on a mattress, a crib with the [[Christ Child]], angels and, on the left side of the painting, the three [[Biblical Magi]]. The colour scheme is mostly limited to yellows, oranges, reds and violets.{{sfn|Zielinska|2015|pp=26–27}} The eastern part of the south wall features a fragmentary depiction of Archangel Michael and the [[Holy Trinity]], while the western part was divided into two scenes, one showing Mary holding the Christ Child, who reaches out for a palm tree. Again the colours are mostly limited to violet, yellow and red.{{sfn|Zielinska|2015|pp=29–30}} The iconography of this last scene is unique in a Makurian context.{{sf|Godlewski|2013|p=45}} The other scene from the western part of the south wall initially featured the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], but was later painted over with the Holy Trinity and a (barely preserved) king wearing a horned crown.{{sfn|Zielinska|2015|pp=30–31}} On the west wall a king with a [[scepter]] and a [[Imperial crown#Byzantine Imperial Crowns|Byzantine crown]], as well as two standing figures with halos, can be seen. The north wall features a large cross, a priest and a king, who wears a crown, a blue veil and a white robe. A later layer of painted plaster added the twenty-four elders from the [[Book of Revelation]], depicted wearing white robes and wielding palm leaves, while sitting on thrones.{{sfn|Zielinska|2015|pp=33–35}}

The '''United Christian Party''' was a minor [[Australia]]n political party active between 1972 and 1974, and again in 1980. Following 1980 it was renamed the '''Australian Christian Party''' and contested the [[Australian federal election, 1983|1983 election]] as such.

Originally formed in [[South Australia]], its platform listed the election of a non-party-bound [[Christian]] to the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], the development of the [[Australian Aboriginal|Aboriginal]] race with the rest of the community, [[monarchism]] and the preservation of the [[Australian flag]]'s current form as its aims. It contested the Senate in 1974 and the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n seats) in 1980 and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Wang Ye worship''' ({{zh|c=王爺信仰}}) is a [[Fujian]]ese and [[Taiwan]]ese folk religion, frequently considered an aspect of the [[Taoism|Taoist]] belief system. Wang Ye is particularly worshiped in [[Southern Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=4417|title=Royal Lords|last=Katz|first=Paul R.|year=2011|work=Encyclopedia of Taiwan|publisher=Council for Cultural Affairs|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The customary belief is that Wang Ye, or '''Wang Yeh''' ({{zh|c=王爺|p=Wángyé|l=royal lord}}), are divine emissaries who tour the world of the living on behalf of the celestial realm, expelling disease and evil from those who worship them. A temple that houses a Wang Ye is generally called 代天府 (''daitian fu'': "palace representing heaven"), and the Wang Ye's visit is known as 代天巡狩 (''dai tian xunshou'': "hunting tour on behalf of heaven"), the object of the "hunting" being disease and bad luck. Such "hunting tours" take place on a regular cycle of a set number of years, usually three years.

==Origins of Wang Ye worship==

Wang Ye worship stems from belief in two main categories of supernatural beings, both of which are spirits of what were once, according to legend, real human beings. 

The first category of Wang Ye belief began with the legend of a kind-hearted intellectual who committed suicide in a well with toxic water in it, trying to stop the villagers from drawing the well water and to stop pestilence from spreading. Therefore, to stop diseases, like pestilence, from spreading, people would pray and make offerings to those beings who committed their own lives for the public. As time passed by, these people are honored as Wang Ye and gradually became disease-dispelling gods and bringers of good fortune.

The second category comprises heroes who attained godhood as a result of great acts in their lives. An example is the spirit of [[Koxinga]], thus honored for his role in fighting the Qing forces.

==The Wang Ye==

There are many Wang Ye: some traditions claim there are a total of 360, with 132 surnames among them.

==Wang Ye festivals==
Wang Ye festivals take place in various parts of Taiwan, mostly in the south. They generally involve processions of gods to ward away disease and bring good fortune, and end with the burning or launch of a replica boat.

One of the primary Wang Ye festivals in Taiwan takes place in the city of [[Donggang, Pingtung|Donggang]], [[Pingtung County]], once every three years. The 2009 festival began on October 10 and culminated in the early morning of October 17, when a wooden boat was set on fire on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Robert|title=Burning boats ward off plague|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/fp.asp?xItem=68767&amp;CtNode=427|accessdate=8 March 2016|work=Taiwan Today|date=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Robert|title=Temple of Fire|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125315178060618481|accessdate=8 March 2016|work=Wall Street Journal|date=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nankunshen Daitian Temple, considered Wang Ye's founding temple, was built in 1817 and is located in [[Beimen District|Beimen]], Tainan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yang|first1=Ching-wu|last2=Chen|first2=Wei-han|title=Tainan temple’s artwork features local celebrities|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/15/2003623091|accessdate=8 March 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
