__NOTOC__
[[File:Convair 990 on ramp EC92-05275-30.jpg|thumb|right|NASA [[Convair 990]] with antishock bodies on the rear of the wings.]]
An '''anti-shock body''' (also known as '''Whitcomb body''' or '''Küchemann carrot''') is a pod positioned on the [[leading edge]] or [[trailing edge]] of an aircraft's aerodynamic surfaces to reduce [[wave drag]] at [[transonic]] speeds ([[Mach number|Mach]] 0.8–1.0).

==Wing trailing edge==
[[File:Antishock body on left wing of 747-100.jpg|thumb|Antishock body serving as [[flap (aircraft)|flap]] track fairing under the left wing of a [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-100]]]]
Most [[jet airliner]]s have a cruising speed between Mach 0.8 and 0.85. Wave drag can be minimized, for aircraft operating in the [[transonic]] regime (Mach 0.8–1.0), by having a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional]] area which changes smoothly along the length of the aircraft. This is known as the [[area rule]], and is the operating principle behind the design of anti-shock bodies. Reducing wave drag improves [[Fuel efficiency in transportation|fuel efficiency]].

Anti-shock bodies, apparently developed in the Soviet Union's [[TsAGI]] research institute and serving a dual purpose as undercarriage bogie fairings, were first applied to the [[Tupolev Tu-16]] jet bomber. The Tu-16 flew for the first time in April 1952, and the bodies were to remain a unique feature of the company's products up to and including the [[Tupolev Tu-154]] designed in the mid-1960s.

Outside the Soviet Union the theory was developed in the early 1950s by [[Richard Whitcomb]] at [[NASA]], and [[Dietrich Küchemann]] at the British [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]], leading to their appearance on aircraft such as the [[Convair 990]] and the [[Handley Page Victor]] bomber. They became known as "Whitcomb bodies" or "Küchemann carrots".

Modern jet aircraft use [[supercritical airfoil]]s, which decrease wave drag significantly. Further optimization can be achieved through careful design of wing body fairings, engine nacelles, flap track fairings, and [[Aircraft fuel tanks|wingtip fuel tanks]]. Due to the prevalence of supercritical airfoils, other design features with the sole purpose of minimizing wave drag (such as the anti-shock bodies on the [[Convair 990]]) are rare in modern aircraft.

==Leading edge root==
[[File:Hawker see hawk 01.jpg|thumb|right|Anti-shock body on the tail of a [[Hawker Sea Hawk]]]]
On the [[Hawker Sea Hawk]], the prototypes experienced high tail drag when approaching transonic speeds. To resolve this, an anti-shock body was subsequently fitted to the leading edge of the junction between the vertical fin and [[tailplane]].{{clear left}}

'''Asphalt roll roofing''' or membrane is a roofing material commonly used for buildings that feature a low sloped roof pitch in North America.  The material is based on the same materials used in [[asphalt shingle]]s; an organic felt or fiberglass mat, saturated with [[asphalt]], and faced with granular stone aggregate.&lt;ref name="arma1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asphaltroofing.org/resources_faq.html#ss6|title=What is roll roofing?|year=2009|work=All About Roofing|publisher=Asphalt Roofing Manufacturers Association|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


==Overview== 
[[File:Roll-roofing-material.jpg|thumb|]]
Roll roofing is usually restricted to a lightweight mat compared to shingles, as it must be rolled for shipment. Rolls are typically {{convert|36|in|cm}} by {{convert|33|ft|m}} in size.&lt;ref name="ocr1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roofing.owenscorning.com/professional/shingles/mineral-surfaced-roll-roofing.aspx|title=Mineral Surfaced Roll|year=2009|publisher=Owens Corning Roofing|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its light weight compared to shingles, roll roofing is regarded as an inexpensive, temporary material. Its broad width makes it vulnerable to temperature-induced shrinkage and tearing as it expands and contracts.

Other names for this material are "asphalt prepared roofing, asphaltic felt, cold-process roofing, prepared roofing, rolled roofing, rolled strip roofing, roofing felt, sanded bituminous felt, saturated felt, self-finished roofing felt."&lt;ref&gt; "cold-process roofing." ''McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Architecture and Construction''. 2003. The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. 20 Dec. 2013 http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/cold-process+roofing
&lt;/ref&gt;

Roll roofing is normally applied parallel to the [[eaves]] from the bottom of the roof upwards, lapping each new roll in the same manner as shingles. Its use is restricted to roofs with a pitch of less than 2:12. To avoid penetrating the exposed membrane with nails, adhesive or "lap cement" must be used at the bottom edge to keep it from being lifted by the wind.  The upper edge of the roll is nailed and covered by the next roll.&lt;ref name="ocr2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roofing.owenscorning.com/docs/installationinstructions/install_msr.pdf|title=2" and 4" Selvedged Mineral Surface Roll Roofing Application Instructions|year=2008|publisher=Owens Corning Roofing and Asphalt, Inc.|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Laimes, sideview Ruzomice.JPG|thumb|right|This roll roofing on the roof was applied vertically and is in very poor condition.]]
[[File:Detail of roof, window and chimney, north side. - Bocco House, Northwest Junction-U.S. Highways 6 and 131, Wolcott, Eagle County, CO HABS COLO,19-WOLC,1-6.tif|thumb|Horizontally applied roll roofing on a ruined log cabin. Image: American Historic Building Survey]]
The main uses are:
* for outbuildings
* on flat roofs on houses in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], a low cost limited life roofing method
* as a backup water catching &amp; wind stopping layer under roofing slates &amp; tiles

==Types==
Several variations of bitumen roofing felt are available. 
*Single coverage thicknesses range from 55 to 90 pounds per square (100 sq. ft.) for single-coverage
*Double coverage range from 110 to 140 pounds per square.&lt;ref&gt;DeCristoforo, R. J.. ''Housebuilding: a-do-it-yourself guide''. Rev. &amp; updated ed. New York: Sterling Pub., 2007. 295. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fibre content:
* mixed rag fibre - lowest cost, shortest life
* all plastic fibres
* fibreglass - longest lived

Bitumen:
* bitumen - stiffens &amp; hardens in winter, cracks in time
* modified bitumen - stays supple in winter, lasts better

Underside:
* Uncoated - most common, applied with adhesive or nails
* Self-adhesive - simpler to apply
* Torchable - applied by torching the underside, which partly melts and glues the sheet. (Most roofing felt is torchable.)

Topping:
* Sand - low cost
* Stone waste - prettier, better life expectancy. Only used on capsheet.
* Uncoated - used as undersheet

Double coverage:
*

==Application methods==
* Glue in place with bitumen/solvent mix
* Nail in place - relies on the clout nail head being driven slightly under the surface for a pressure seal. Waterproofing not quite perfect, a water durable timber layer is used under the felt, usually OSB or ply. Most common method on sheds.
* Hot bitumen
* Torch on - underside of felt melted with a torch and pressed in place

In 2018 [[Rosatom]] announced it had developed a [[thermal annealing]] technique for [[reactor pressure vessel]]s which ameliorates radiation damage and extends service life by between 15 and 30 years. This had been demonstrated on unit 1.&lt;ref name=wnn-20181127&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Rosatom-launches-annealing-technology-for-VVER-100 |title=Rosatom launches annealing technology for VVER-1000 units |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=27 November 2018 |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June 1985 during startup of the first reactor unit, a [[human error]] (later attributed to inexperience and haste) unexpectedly opened a pressurizer [[relief valve]], and 300&amp;nbsp;°C [[steam]] entered the staff work area. Fourteen people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/accidents/accidents-1980's-05.htm |title=Accidents 1980's |website=nuclearfiles.org |date=2009-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517111322/http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/accidents/accidents-1980%27s-05.htm |archive-date=2009-05-17 |access-date=2017-02-18 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event is cited as one of the predecessors of the [[Chernobyl disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Grigory Medvedev (writer)|Medvedev, Grigory]].

To improve building energy efficiency, the [[Hong Kong Government]] formulated a '''Buildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance''' (建築物能源效益條例)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beeo.emsd.gov.hk/en/mibec_beeo.html Buildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance]&lt;/ref&gt; which was passed by the Legislative Council in November 2010. Under the Ordinance, certain prescribed types of buildings have to comply with [[Building Energy Code]] (BEC) and/or [[Energy Audit Code]] (EAC). The Ordinance came into full operation on 21 September 2012.

Under the Ordinance, building services installations including electrical, air-conditioning, lighting and lift and escalator installations in newly constructed buildings are required to meet the minimum energy efficiency standards and requirements as specified in the Code of Practice for Energy Efficiency of Building Services Installation. Existing buildings will also be required to comply with the requirement when undergoing major retrofitting works. The standards stipulated in the Code, which was published in February 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201209/21/P201209210227.htm Buildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance comes into full operation ]&lt;/ref&gt; are more stringent than those in the last version promulgated in 2007, which have been implemented on a voluntary basis. Most of the new standards are comparable to those adopted in the US, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, while some standards are not specified in overseas jurisdictions.

In addition, the central building services installations of commercial buildings and commercial portions of composite buildings are required to carry out energy audits in accordance with the Code of Practice for Building Energy Audit &lt;ref&gt;[http://buildingenergy.hk/download/668/ Code of Practice for Building Energy Audit]&lt;/ref&gt; every 10 years, and the results have to be displayed in a conspicuous position at the main entrance of the buildings concerned for public inspection.

Implementation of the Ordinance is operated by the [[Electrical and Mechanical Services Department]]

A '''candle warmer''' is an electric warmer that melts a [[candle]] or scented [[wax]] to release its [[odor|scent]]. The candle warmer shown is intended to be used with jar candles or candles in cups, not with taper candles or candles without containers large enough to accommodate all the melted wax. Some candle warmers have a built-in bowl in which the candle is placed.

The advantages of using a candle warmer include the absence of open flame and the [[soot]] that often results from burning wax. The main disadvantage of a plate candle warmer is candle life.  While the candle can still be burned (provided the [[candle wick|wick]] is still exposed), the wax no longer contains any fragrances. Many warmers are designed to be used with "wickless" candles, which are blocks or lumps of scented candle wax with no wick. It is also used to keep hot beverages such as coffee warm by placing the mug on the warmer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33755">The term '''Dirac matter''' refers to a class of [[condensed matter]] systems which can be effectively described by the [[Dirac equation]]. Even though the [[Dirac equation]] itself was formulated for [[fermions]],
the quasi-particles present within Dirac matter can be of any statistics. As a consequence, Dirac matter can be distinguished in [[fermionic]], [[bosonic]] or [[Anyon|anyonic]] Dirac matter. Prominent examples of Dirac matter are [[Graphene]], [[topological insulators]], Dirac semimetals, [[Weyl semimetal]]s, various [[high-temperature superconductors]] with &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-wave pairing and [[Helium-3|liquid Helium-3]]. The effective theory of such systems is classified by a specific choice of the [[Dirac mass]], the Dirac velocity, the [[Dirac matrices]] and the [[space-time curvature]]. The universal treatment of the class of Dirac matter in terms of an effective theory leads to a common features with respect to the [[density of states]], the [[heat capacity]] and impurity scattering.

== Definition ==
Members of the class of Dirac matter differ significantly in nature. However, all examples of Dirac matter are unified by similarities within the algebraic structure of an effective theory describing them. 

=== General ===

The general definition of Dirac matter is a condensed matter system where the [[quasi-particle]] excitations can be described in curved spacetime by the generalised Dirac equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \left[i \hbar v_D \gamma^a e_a^\mu d_\mu(p) - m v_D^2\right]\Psi = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
In the above definition &lt;math&gt;d_\mu&lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[covariant vector]] depending on the &lt;math&gt;(d+1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional momentum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; space &lt;math&gt;+ 1&lt;/math&gt; time dimension), &lt;math&gt;e_a^\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vierbein]] describing the curvature of the space, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the [[quasi-particle]] mass and &lt;math&gt;v_D&lt;/math&gt; the Dirac velocity. Note that since in Dirac matter the Dirac equation gives the effective theory of the quasiparticles, the energy from the mass term is &lt;math&gt;m v_D^2&lt;/math&gt;, not the rest mass &lt;math&gt;m c^2&lt;/math&gt; of a massive particle. &lt;math&gt;\gamma^\mu&lt;/math&gt; refers to a set of [[Dirac matrices]], where the defining for the construction is given by the anticommutation relation,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left\{\gamma^\mu,\gamma^\nu \right\} = \gamma^\mu\gamma^\nu + \gamma^\nu\gamma^\mu = \eta^{\mu\nu} I_d.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\eta^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Minkowski metric]] with signature (+ - - -) and &lt;math&gt;I_d&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;d\times d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional unit matrix.
In all equations, implicit summation over &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is used ([[Einstein convention]]). Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavefunction]]. The unifying feature of all Dirac matter is the matrix structure of the equation describing the quasi-particle excitations.

In the limit where &lt;math&gt;d_\mu(p) = D_\mu&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the [[covariant derivative]], conventional Dirac matter is obtained. However, this general definition allows the description of matter with higher order dispersion relations and in curved spacetime as long as the effective [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] exhibits the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] structure specific to the [[Dirac equation]].

=== Common (conventional) ===

The majority of experimental realisations of Dirac matter to date are in the limit of &lt;math&gt;d_\mu (p) = D_\mu&lt;/math&gt; which therefore defines conventional Dirac matter in which the quasiparticles are described by the [[Dirac equation in curved spacetime|Dirac equation in curved space-time]],
:&lt;math&gt;
 \left[i \hbar v_D \gamma^a e_a^\mu D_\mu - m v_D^2\right]\Psi = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;D_\mu&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[covariant derivative]]. As an example, for the flat metric, the energy of a free Dirac particle differs significantly from the classical kinetic energy where energy is proportional to momentum squared:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathrm{Free~Dirac~particle: \;} E &amp;= \pm \sqrt{\hbar^2 v_D^2\mathbf{k}^2+m^2c^4} \\
\mathrm{Kinetic\; energy: \;} E &amp;= \frac{m |\mathbf{v}|^2}{2} = \frac{|\mathbf{k}|^2}{2m}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The Dirac velocity &lt;math&gt;v_D&lt;/math&gt; gives the gradient of the &lt;math&gt;E-k&lt;/math&gt; dispersion at large momenta &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of particle or object. In the case of massless Dirac matter, such as the fermionic quasiparticles in [[graphene]] or [[Weyl semimetal]]s, the energy-momentum relation is linear,
:&lt;math&gt;
 E(\mathbf{k}) = \hbar v_D |\mathbf{k}|
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, conventional Dirac matter includes all systems that have a linear crossing or linear behavior in some region of the energy-momentum relation. They are characterised by features that resemble an 'X', sometimes tilted or skewed and sometimes with a gap between the upper &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; and lower &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; parts (the turning points of which become rounded if the origin of the gap is a mass term). 

The general features and some specific examples of conventional Dirac matter are discussed in the following sections.

== General properties of Dirac matter == 
=== Technological relevance and tuning of Dirac matter ===

[[File:Tuning of Dirac matter.png|thumb|Tuning of Dirac matter: As the density of states is well defined, the density of states at the Fermi level (for fermionic Dirac matter) can be nicely tuned by shifting the chemical potential &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. Additionally, introducing a mass term &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; leads to a gap between the two cones and the dispersion becomes quadratic near &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt;.]]

Dirac matter, especially fermionic Dirac matter has much potential for technological applications. For example 2010's [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to [[Andre Geim]] and [[Konstantin Novoselov]] "for groundbreaking experiments regarding the material graphene". Within the official press release of the [[Swedish Royal Academy of Science]] it is stated that&lt;ref name="nobelprize"&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/press.pdf The Nobel Prize in Physics 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote

}}

In general, the properties of massless fermionic Dirac matter can be controlled by shifting the [[chemical potential]] by means of [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or within a [[field effect (semiconductor)|field effect]] setup. By tuning the [[chemical potential]], it is possible to have a precise control of the number of states present, since the [[density of states]] varies in a well-defined way with energy.

Additionally, depending on the specific realization of the Dirac material, it may be possible to introduce a mass term &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; that opens a gap in the spectrum - a [[band gap]]. In general, the mass term is the result of breaking a specific symmetry of the system. The size of the [[band gap]] can be controlled precisely by controlling the strength of the mass term.

=== Density of states ===
The [[density of states]] of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Dirac matter near the Dirac point scales as &lt;math&gt;N(\epsilon)\propto |\epsilon|^{d-1}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the particle energy&lt;ref name="wehling2014dirac"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00018732.2014.927109|title=Dirac materials|journal=Advances in Physics|volume=63|issue=1|page=1|year=2014|last1=Wehling|first1=T.O|last2=Black-Schaffer|first2=A.M|last3=Balatsky|first3=A.V|arxiv=1405.5774}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The vanishing density of states for quasiparticles in Dirac matter mimics [[semimetal]] physics for physical dimension &lt;math&gt;d&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. In the two-dimensional systems such as graphene and topological insulators, the density of states gives a V shape, compared with the constant value for massive particles with dispersion &lt;math&gt;E=k^2/2m&lt;/math&gt;.

Experimental measurement of the density of states near the Dirac point by standard techniques such as scanning tunnelling microscopy often differ from the theoretical form due to the effects of disorder and interactions.&lt;ref name="principi2011tunneling"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ssc.2012.04.040|title=The tunneling density-of-states of interacting massless Dirac fermions|journal=Solid State Communications|volume=152|issue=15|page=1456|year=2012|last1=Principi|first1=A|last2=Polini|first2=Marco|last3=Asgari|first3=Reza|last4=MacDonald|first4=A.H|arxiv=1111.3822|bibcode=2012SSCom.152.1456P}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Specific heat ===
Specific heat, the [[heat capacity]] per unit mass, describes the energy required to change the temperature of a sample. The low-temperature electronic [[specific heat]] of Dirac matter is &lt;math&gt;C(T\to 0)\sim T^d&lt;/math&gt; which is different from &lt;math&gt;C(T\to 0)\sim T&lt;/math&gt; encountered for normal metals &lt;ref name="wehling2014dirac"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00018732.2014.927109|title=Dirac materials|journal=Advances in Physics|volume=63|issue=1|page=1|year=2014|last1=Wehling|first1=T.O|last2=Black-Schaffer|first2=A.M|last3=Balatsky|first3=A.V|arxiv=1405.5774}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, for systems whose physical dimension is greater than 1, the specific heat can provide a clear signature of the underlying Dirac nature of the quasiparticles.

=== Landau quantization ===
[[Landau quantization]] refers to the quantization of the cyclotron orbits of charged particles in magnetic fields. As a result, the charged particles can only occupy orbits with discrete energy values, called Landau levels. For 2-dimensional systems with a perpendicular magnetic field, the energy for Landau-levels for ordinary matter described the Schrödinger equation and Dirac matter are given by&lt;ref name="wehling2014dirac"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00018732.2014.927109|title=Dirac materials|journal=Advances in Physics|volume=63|issue=1|page=1|year=2014|last1=Wehling|first1=T.O|last2=Black-Schaffer|first2=A.M|last3=Balatsky|first3=A.V|arxiv=1405.5774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\omega_c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cyclotron frequency]] which is linearly dependent of the applied magnetic field and the charge of the particle. There are two distinct features between the Landau level quantization for 2D Schrödinger fermions (ordinary matter) and 2D Dirac fermions. First, the energy for Schrödinger fermions is linearly dependent with respect to the integer quantum number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, whereas it exhibits a square-root dependence for the Dirac fermions.

== Fermionic Dirac matter ==
In the context of Fermionic quasiparticles, the Dirac velocity is identical to the Fermi velocity; in bosonic systems, no Fermi velocity exists, so the Dirac velocity is a more general property of such systems.

=== Graphene ===
[[Graphene]] is a 2-dimensional crystalline [[allotrope]] of [[carbon]], where the carbon atoms are arranged on an [[hexagonal lattice]].
Each carbon atom forms &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-bonds to the three neighboring atoms that lie in the graphene plane at angles of 120&lt;math&gt;^\circ&lt;/math&gt;. These bonds are mediated by three of carbon's four [[electrons]] while the fourth electron, which occupies a &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{p}_z&lt;/math&gt; [[Atomic orbital|orbital]], mediates an out-of-plane [[pi-bond|{{pi}}-bond]] that leads to the [[Electronic band structure | electronic bands]] at the [[Fermi level]]. The unique transport properties and the [[semimetal | semimetallic]] state of graphene are the result of the delocalized electrons occupying these p&lt;math&gt;_z&lt;/math&gt; orbitals &lt;ref name="abergel2010properties"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00018732.2010.487978|title=Properties of graphene: A theoretical perspective|journal=Advances in Physics|volume=59|issue=4|pages=261–482|year=2010|last1=Abergel|first1=D.S.L|last2=Apalkov|first2=V|last3=Berashevich|first3=J|last4=Ziegler|first4=K|last5=Chakraborty|first5=Tapash|arxiv=1003.0391}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The semimetallic state corresponds to a linear crossing of energy bands at the &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt; points of graphene's hexagonal [[Brillouin zone]]. At these two points, the electronic structure can be effectively described by the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]
:&lt;math&gt;
{\cal H} = \hbar v_D \left(\tau k_x \sigma_x + k_y \sigma_y \right). 
&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; are two of the three [[Pauli matrices]].
The factor &lt;math&gt;\tau=+/-&lt;/math&gt; indicates whether the Hamiltonian describes is centred on the &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt; valley at the corner of hexagonal [[Brillouin zone]]. For graphene, the Dirac velocity is about &lt;math&gt;\hbar v_D \approx 5.8&lt;/math&gt; eV &lt;math&gt;\AA&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="abergel2010properties"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00018732.2010.487978|title=Properties of graphene: A theoretical perspective|journal=Advances in Physics|volume=59|issue=4|pages=261–482|year=2010|last1=Abergel|first1=D.S.L|last2=Apalkov|first2=V|last3=Berashevich|first3=J|last4=Ziegler|first4=K|last5=Chakraborty|first5=Tapash|arxiv=1003.0391}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An energy gap in the dispersion of graphene can be obtained from a low-energy Hamiltionain of the form 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{\cal H} = \hbar v_D (\tau k_x \sigma_x + k_y\sigma_y) + M \sigma_z,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

L|last2=Mele|first2=E. J|arxiv=cond-mat/0411737|bibcode=2005PhRvL..95v6801K}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The most practical approach for creating a gap (introducing a mass term) is to break the sublattice symmetry of the lattice where each carbon atom is slightly different to its nearest but identical to its next-nearest neighbours; an effect that may result from substrate effects.

=== Topological insulators ===
A [[topological insulator]] is a material that behaves as an insulator in its interior (bulk) but whose surface contains conducting states. This property represents a non-trivial, symmetry protected [[topological order]]. As a consequence, electrons in topological insulators can only move along the [[Interface (matter)|surface]] of the material. In the bulk of a non-interacting topological insulator, the [[Fermi level]] is positioned within the gap between the [[valence and conduction bands | conduction and valence bands]]. On the surface, there are special states within the bulk [[energy gap]] which can be effectively described by a Dirac Hamiltonian: 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{\cal H} = \hbar v_{D} (\mathbf{k}\times \mathbf{\sigma})\cdot\hat{\mathbf{z}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{z}}&lt;/math&gt; is normal to the surface and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{\sigma}}&lt;/math&gt; is in the real [[spin (physics)|spin]] basis. However, if we rotate spin by a [[unitary operator]], &lt;math&gt;U={\rm diag}[1,i]&lt;/math&gt;, we will end up with the standard notation of Dirac Hamiltonian, &lt;math&gt;{\cal H} = \hbar v_{D} {\mathbf{\sigma}}\cdot {\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt;.   
Such Dirac cones emerging on the surface of 3-dimensional crystals were observed in experiment, e.g.: [[bismuth selenide]] (Bi&lt;math&gt;_2&lt;/math&gt;Si&lt;math&gt;_3&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;ref name="xia2009observation"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nphys1274|title=Observation of a large-gap topological-insulator class with a single Dirac cone on the surface|journal=Nature Physics|volume=5|issue=6|pages=398–402|year=2009|last1=Xia|first1=Y|last2=Qian|first2=D|last3=Hsieh|first3=D|last4=Wray|first4=L|last5=Pal|first5=A|last6=Lin|first6=H|last7=Bansil|first7=A|last8=Grauer|first8=D|last9=Hor|first9=Y.

The spin-orbit coupling &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; provides a large spin-splitting in the valence band and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; indicates the [[spin (physics) | spin]] degree of freedom. As for graphene, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; gives the valley degree of freedom - whether near the &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;K^\prime&lt;/math&gt; point of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. Transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers are often discussed in reference to potential applications in [[valleytronics]].

One distinct, experimentally observable feature of Weyl semimetals is that the surface states form [[Fermi arc | Fermi arcs]] since the [[Fermi surface]] does not form a closed loop.

=== Dirac semimetals ===
In crystals that are symmetric under [[point reflection | inversion]] and [[T-symmetry | time reversal]], electronic energy bands are two-fold degenerate. This degeneracy is referred to as [[Kramers degeneracy]]. Therefore semimetals with linear crossings of two energy bands (two-fold degeneracy) at the [[Fermi energy]] exhibit a four-fold degeneracy at the crossing point. The effective [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for these states can be written as 
:&lt;math&gt;
{\cal H} = \hbar v_D \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 \vec{k}\cdot\vec{\sigma} &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; -\vec{k}\cdot\vec{\sigma}

\right).

== Bosonic Dirac matter ==
[[File:Dispersions for bosonic (left) and fermionic (right) Dirac materials.png|thumb|Dispersions for bosonic (left) and fermionic (right) Dirac materials. In contrast to the fermionic case where Pauli exclusion confines excitations close to the Fermi energy, the description of boson requires the entire Brillioun zone.]]
While historic interest focussed on fermionic quasiparticles that have potential for technological applications, particularly in electronics, the mathematical structure of the [[Dirac equation]] is not restricted to the [[Particle statistics | statistics of the particles]]. This has led to recent development of the concept of bosonic Dirac matter.

In the case of [[bosons]], there is no [[Pauli exclusion principle]] to confine excitations close to the [[chemical potential]] (Fermi energy for fermions) so the entire [[Brillouin zone]] must be included. At low temperatures, the bosons will collect at the lowest energy point, the &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;-point of the lower band. Energy must be added to excite the quasiparticles to the vicinity of the linear crossing point.

Several examples of Dirac matter with fermionic quasi-particles occur in systems where there is a hexagonal crystal lattice; so bosonic quasiparticles on an hexagonal lattice are the natural candidates for bosonic Dirac matter. In fact, the underlying symmetry of a crystal structure strongly constrains and protects the emergence of linear band crossings. Typical bosonic [[quasiparticles]] in [[condensed matter]] are [[magnon | magnons]], [[phonons]], [[polaritons]] and [[plasmons]].

== Anyonic Dirac materials ==
Anyonic Dirac matter is a hypothetical field which is rather unexplored to date. An [[anyon]] is a type of quasiparticle that can only occur in two-dimensional systems. Considering [[bosons]] and [[fermions]], the interchange of two particles contributes a factor of 1 or -1 to the wave function. In contrast, the operation of exchanging two identical anyons causes a global phase shift. Anyons are generally classified as ''abelian'' or ''non-abelian,'' according to whether the elementary excitations of the theory transform under an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[group representation|representation]] of the [[braid group]] or a non-abelian one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(91)90407-O |url=http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~gmoore/MooreReadNonabelions.pdf |title=Nonabelions in the fractional quantum hall effect |date=19 Aug 1991 |last1=Moore |first1=Gregory |authorlink1=Greg Moore (physicist) |last2=Read |first2=Nicholas |authorlink2=Nicholas Read |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=360 |issue=2–3 |pages=362–396 |bibcode=1991NuPhB.360..362M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abelian anyons have been detected in connection to the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]]. The possible construction of anyonic Dirac matter relies on the symmetry protection of crossings of anyonic energy bands. In comparison to bosons and fermions the situation gets more complicated as translations in space do not necessarily commute. Additionally, for given spatial symmetries, the group structure describing the anyon strongly depends on the specific phase of the anyon interchange. For example, for bosons, a rotation of a particle about 2{{pi}} i.e., 360&lt;math&gt;^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, will not change its wave function. For fermions, a rotation of a particle about 2{{pi}}, will contribute a factor of &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; to its wave function, whereas a 4{{pi}} rotation, i.e., a rotation about 720&lt;math&gt;^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, will give the same wave function as before. For anyons, an even higher degree of rotation can be necessary, e.g., 6{{pi}}, 8{{pi}}, etc, to leave the wave function invariant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13050">[[Image:Fuel cell NASA p48600ac.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Direct-methanol fuel cell]]
'''Direct-methanol fuel cells''' or '''DMFCs''' are a subcategory of [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell|proton-exchange fuel cells]] in which [[methanol]] is used as the fuel. Their main advantage is the ease of transport of methanol, an energy-dense yet reasonably stable liquid at all environmental conditions.

Efficiency is quite low for these cells, so they are targeted especially to portable applications, where energy and power density are more important than efficiency.

A more efficient version of a direct fuel cell would play a key role in the theoretical use of methanol as a general energy transport medium, in the hypothesized [[methanol economy]].

== The cell ==
In contrast to [[indirect methanol fuel cell]]s, where methanol is reacted to [[hydrogen]] by steam reforming, DMFCs use a methanol solution (usually around 1[[Molarity|M]], i.e. about 3% in mass) to carry the reactant into the cell; common operating temperatures are in the range 50&amp;ndash;120 °C, where high temperatures are usually pressurized.
DMFCs themselves are more efficient at high temperatures and pressures, but these conditions end up causing so many losses in the complete system that the advantage is lost;&lt;ref&gt;Dohle, H.; Mergel, J. &amp; Stolten, D.: Heat and power management of a direct-methanol-fuel-cell (DMFC) system, Journal of Power Sources, 2002, 111, 268-282.&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, atmospheric-pressure configurations are currently preferred.

Because of the methanol cross-over, a phenomenon by which methanol diffuses through the membrane without reacting, methanol is fed as a weak solution: this decreases efficiency significantly, since crossed-over methanol, after reaching the air side (the cathode), immediately reacts with air; though the exact kinetics are debated, the end result is a reduction of the cell voltage.
Cross-over remains a major factor in inefficiencies, and often half of the methanol is lost to cross-over. Methanol cross-over and/or its effects can be alleviated by (a) developing alternative membranes (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wei|first=Yongsheng|title=A novel membrane for DMFC – Na2Ti3O7 Nanotubes/Nafion® composite membrane: Performances studies|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|year=2012|volume=37|issue=2|pages=1857–1864|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.08.107|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;), (b) improving the electro-oxidation process in the catalyst layer and improving the structure of the catalyst and gas diffusion layers (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matar|first=Saif|author2=Hongtan Liu|title=Effect of cathode catalyst layer thickness on methanol cross-over in a DMFC|journal=Electrochimica Acta|year=2010|volume=56|issue=1|pages=600–606|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2010.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), and (c) optimizing the design of the flow field and the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) which can be achieved by studying the current density distributions (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Almheiri|first=Saif|author2=Hongtan Liu|title=Separate measurement of current density under land and channel in Direct Methanol Fuel Cells|journal=Journal of Power Sources|year=2014|volume=246|pages=899–905|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; ).

Other issues include the management of [[carbon dioxide]] created at the [[anode]], the sluggish dynamic behavior, and the ability to maintain the solution water.

The only waste products with these types of fuel cells are [[carbon dioxide]] and water.

== Application ==
Current DMFCs are limited in the power they can produce, but can still store a high energy content in a small space.  This means they can produce a small amount of power over a long period of time. This makes them ill-suited for powering large vehicles (at least directly), but ideal for smaller vehicles such as forklifts and tuggers&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=8409053 Tenn. Nissan Plant to Use Methanol to Cut Costs ] by ABC News.&lt;/ref&gt; and consumer goods such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[digital camera]]s or [[laptop]]s. Military applications of DMFCs are an emerging application since they have low noise and thermal signatures and no toxic effluent. These applications include power for man-portable tactical equipment, battery chargers, and autonomous power for test and training instrumentation. Units are available with power outputs between 25 watts and 5 kilowatts with durations up to 100 hours between refuelings.

== Methanol ==
Methanol is a liquid from -97.0 °C to 64.7 °C at atmospheric pressure.
The [[energy density]] of methanol is an order of magnitude greater than even highly [[compressed hydrogen]], and 15 times higher than [[Lithium-ion battery|Lithium-ion batteries]].{{Citation Needed|date=July 2014}}

Methanol is [[toxicity|toxic]] and [[Flammability|flammable]].
However, the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Dangerous Goods Panel (DGP) voted in November 2005 to allow passengers to carry and use micro fuel cells and methanol fuel cartridges when aboard airplanes to power [[laptop computer]]s and other consumer electronic devices.
On September 24, 2007, the [[US Department of Transportation]] issued a proposal to allow airline passengers to carry fuel cell cartridges on board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/online/news/articles/2007-09/US-Department-of-Transportation-moves-to-approve-fuel-cells-for-aircraft-use ''US Department of Transportation moves to approve fuel cells for aircraft use''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211170242/http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/online/news/articles/2007-09/US-Department-of-Transportation-moves-to-approve-fuel-cells-for-aircraft-use |date=2009-02-11 }}, by FuelCellToday.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Department of Transportation issued a final ruling on April 30, 2008, permitting passengers and crew to carry an approved fuel cell with an installed methanol cartridge and up to two additional spare cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Federal%20Register/Hazmat/HM-215J%20Final%20Rule%2012-30-08.pdf ''Hazardous Materials: Revision to Requirements for the Transportation of Batteries and Battery-Powered Devices; and Harmonization with the United Nations Recommendations, International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, and International Civil Aviation Organization's Technical Instructions''], by the US department of transportation.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is worth noting that 200 ml maximum methanol cartridge volume allowed in the final ruling is double the 100 ml limit on liquids allowed by the Transportation Security Administration in carry-on bags.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/311_intl_acceptance.shtm ''3-1-1 Gains International Acceptance''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155910/http://www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/311_intl_acceptance.shtm |date=2008-05-09 }}, by the US transport security administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
The DMFC relies upon the [[redox|oxidation]] of [[methanol]] on a [[catalyst]] layer to form [[carbon dioxide]]. Water is consumed at the [[anode]] and is produced at the [[cathode]]. [[Proton]]s (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are transported across the proton exchange membrane - often made from [[Nafion]] - to the cathode where they react with [[oxygen]] to produce water. [[Electron]]s are transported through an external circuit from anode to cathode, providing power to connected devices.

The [[half-reaction]]s are:

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" style="border-collapse:collapse;"
 !
 !Equation
 |-
 !Anode
 |&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CH_3OH + H_2O \to 6\ H^+  + 6\ e^- + CO_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;oxidation&lt;/small&gt;
 |-
 !Cathode
 |&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{3}{2} O_2 + 6\ H^+  + 6\ e^- \to 3\ H_2O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;reduction&lt;/small&gt;
 |-
 !Overall reaction
 |&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CH_3OH + \frac{3}{2} O_2 \to 2\ H_2O + CO_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;redox reaction&lt;/small&gt;
 |-
 |}

Methanol and water are adsorbed on a catalyst usually made of [[platinum]] and [[ruthenium]] particles, and lose protons until carbon dioxide is formed.  As water is consumed at the [[anode]] in the reaction, pure methanol cannot be used without provision of water via either passive transport such as back [[diffusion]] ([[osmosis]]), or [[active transport]] such as pumping. The need for water limits the energy density of the fuel.

Platinum is used as a catalyst for both half-reactions. This contributes to the loss of cell voltage potential, as any methanol that is present in the cathode chamber will oxidize. If another catalyst could be found for the reduction of oxygen, the problem of methanol crossover would likely be significantly lessened. Furthermore, platinum is very expensive and contributes to the high cost per kilowatt of these cells.

During the methanol oxidation reaction [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) is formed, which strongly adsorbs onto the platinum catalyst, reducing the number of available reaction sites and thus the performance of the cell. The addition of other metals, such as [[ruthenium]] or [[gold]], to the platinum catalyst tends to ameliorate this problem. In the case of platinum-ruthenium catalysts, the oxophilic nature of ruthenium is believed to promote the formation of [[hydroxyl radicals]] on its surface, which can then react with carbon monoxide adsorbed on the platinum atoms. The water in the fuel cell is oxidized to a hydroxy radical via the following reaction: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → OH• + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. The hydroxy radical then oxidizes [[carbon monoxide]] to produce [[carbon dioxide]], which is released from the surface as a gas: CO + OH• → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Motoo|first=S.|author2=Watanabe, M.|title=Electrolysis by Ad-Atoms Part II. Enhancement of the Oxidation of Methanol on Platinum by Ruthenium Ad-Atoms|journal=Electrochemistry and Interfacial Electrochemistry|year=1975|volume=60|pages=267-273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using these OH groups in the half reactions, they are also expressed as:

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" style="border-collapse:collapse;"
 !
 !Equation
 |-
 !Anode
 |&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CH_3OH + 6\ OH^- \to 5\ H_2O  + 6\ e^- + CO_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;oxidation&lt;/small&gt;
 |-
 !Cathode
 |&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{3}{2} O_2 + 3\ H_2O  + 6\ e^- \to 6\ OH^-}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;reduction&lt;/small&gt;
 |-
 !Overall reaction
 |&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CH_3OH + \frac{3}{2} O_2 \to 2\ H_2O + CO_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;redox reaction&lt;/small&gt;
 |-
 |}

=== Cross-over current ===
Methanol on the anodic side is usually in a weak solution (from 1M to 3M), because methanol in high concentrations has the tendency to diffuse through the membrane to the cathode, where its concentration is about zero because it is rapidly consumed by oxygen. Low concentrations help in reducing the cross-over, but also limit the maximum attainable current.

The practical realization is usually that a solution loop enters the anode, exits, is refilled with methanol, and returns to the anode again. Alternatively, fuel cells with optimized structures can be directly fed with high concentration methanol solutions or even pure methanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Xianglin|author2=Faghri|title=Amir|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=226|pages=223–240|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.10.061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water drag ===
The water in the anodic loop is lost because of the anodic reaction, but mostly because of the associated water drag: every proton formed at the anode drags a number of water molecules to the cathode. Depending on temperature and membrane type, this number can be between 2 and 6.

== Ancillary units ==
A direct methanol fuel cell is usually part of a larger system including all the ancillary units that permit its operation. Compared to most other types of fuel cells, the ancillary system of DMFCs is relatively complex. The main reasons for its complexity are:

* providing water along with methanol would make the fuel supply more cumbersome, so water has to be recycled in a loop;
* CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has to be removed from the solution flow exiting the fuel cell;
* water in the anodic loop is slowly consumed by reaction and drag; it is necessary to recover water from the cathodic side to maintain steady operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10991">'''Durant-Dort Carriage Company''' was a manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles in Flint, Michigan. Founded in 1886, by 1900 it was the largest carriage manufacturer in the country.

This very successful business made the partners rich men and it became the core on which [[William C Durant]] and [[Josiah Dallas Dort|J Dallas Dort]] began to build [[General Motors]].

Durant sold out of this business in 1914 and it stopped manufacturing carriages in 1917. Durant-Dort Carriage Company was dissolved in 1924.&lt;ref name="AOA"&gt;{{cite news |title=Articles of Association, Genesee County |agency=State of Michigan Archives |issue=Record Group 81-50, Container V1-10 |publisher=Lansing, Michigan |date=1841-1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premises were taken over by J Dallas Dort's [[Dort Motor Car Company]] which he closed in 1924.

==Flint Road-Cart Company==
[[File:Sloan Museum July 2018 09 (c. 1886-1893 Flint Road Cart Company road cart).jpg|thumb|Flint Road-Cart Company road-cart at the [[Sloan Museum]]]]
In 1886 [[William C. Durant]] rode in a friend's spring-suspension&lt;ref group=note&gt;The seat with attached footrest was supported above the axle by long cantilevers. The cantilevers which freely pivoted on their fulcrum were supported by leaf springs fixed to the shafts.&lt;/ref&gt; road-cart built by the Coldwater Road-Cart Company of [[Coldwater, Michigan]]. Impressed with the smoothness of the ride Durant went to Coldwater and bought the road-cart's patent and manufacturing rights from Schmedlin and O'Brien for $1500. With [[Josiah Dallas Dort]] as an equal partner he founded Flint Road-Cart. Dort as president handled administrative details for the firm and manufacturing arrangements — to begin with the carts were made for them by [[William A. Paterson]] — while Durant handled sales and promotion. Their first office was in Durant's fire insurance agency in downtown Flint.&lt;ref name=Fols&gt;Burton W. Folsom Jr. ''Empire Builders; how Michigan entrepreneurs helped make America great''. 1998 Rhodes &amp; Easton, Traverse City, Michigan 49684. {{ISBN|1890394068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had bought the rights to the road-cart with borrowed money so newly married Durant immediately left Flint and set up a chain of jobbers to sell the carts as far away as Madison, Milwaukee and Chicago. With just one finished cart at home he returned from his first trip with orders for 600 road-carts. Flint Road-Cart sold 4000 carts its first year, and grew quickly from there.&lt;ref name=Fols/&gt;

In 1893 they incorporated Flint Road-Cart Company with a substantial capital, much of it raised from local investors, and leased a factory on Water Street originally used by the Flint Woolen Mills. There they assembled their road-carts from bought-in components.&lt;ref name="flintc"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ci.flint.mi.us/HDC/DortCarriage.htm |title=Historic Districts – Flint Road Cart Factory|publisher=City of Flint, MI|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120309060330/http://www.ci.flint.mi.us/HDC/DortCarriage.htm |archivedate=March 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that Flint Road-Cart expanded by starting or buying other businesses that produced not only vehicles, but the components for vehicles as well. They marketed them as "Blue Ribbon Vehicles".&lt;ref name=Fols/&gt;

==Durant-Dort Carriage Company==
Flint Road-Cart Company changed its name to Durant-Dort Carriage Company in November 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=J.D. Dort |journal=The Hub |date=September 1898 |volume= 40| issue =  5 |page=411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900 they were  building 50,000 vehicles each year from around 14 locations and they were a major rival of [[Flint Wagon Works]]. In 1906 they were making 480 vehicles each day with 1,000 workers.&lt;ref name=Fols/&gt; Durant-Dort owned not just the Flint manufacturing works, but also other vehicle assembly plants in Michigan, Georgia, and Ontario, together with timberland, lumber mills, a wheel manufacturer, the Flint Axle Works, and the Flint Varnish Works.

===Diamond Buggy Company===
A separate business named Diamond Buggy Company was established in 1896 to built low-priced carts sold for cash only. The first plant manager was A.B.C. Hardy.

===Manufacture of own components===
*1897: established Flint Gear and Top Company
*1898: bought Imperial Wheel Company, [[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]]. Imperial Wheel was later moved to Flint and [[Buick]] took over the Jackson plant
*1900: established Flint Axle Works on a farm just north of Flint where the unavoidable noise would give less offence
*1901: Flint Varnish Works
Durant decided making their own components instead of buying them in would give Durant-Dort better control over costs and the ability to improve efficiency. 
All component factories were relocated to Flint to further speed production. These extra activities placed a lot of pressure on Durant's friends. Dallas Dort left the business in 1898 and didn't return until 1900.

Hardy was sent on a tour of Europe in 1901. On that holiday he became fascinated by automobiles. In 1902 he established his Flint Automobile Company and built over fifty cars with Weston-Mott axles and W F Stewart bodies. The [[Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers]] demanded a licence fee of $50 for each engine Hardy had built so he ended production and "moved to Iowa".

==Dort Motor Car Company==
Durant-Dort continued making horse-drawn vehicles until 1917 but from 1915 the factory and office buildings refocused on the manufacture of [[Dort Motor Car Company]] automobiles. J. Dallas Dort began his own independent automotive business, [[Dort Motor Car Company]], in 1915.&lt;ref name="remember"&gt;{{cite news|title=Remembering Josiah Dallas Dort and his automobile|first=Frank |last=Sherosky|newspaper=Detroit Automotive Technology Examiner|date=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dort used the old Durant-Dort buildings but added more to them.&lt;ref name="gen1"&gt;{{citation|title=History of Genesee County, Michigan: Her People, Industries and Institutions, Volume 1|first=Edwin Orin |last=Wood|publisher =Federal Publishers |year=1916|page=778|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zKp5AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA778 |accessdate=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dort shipped 9000 cars in its first year.&lt;ref name="gen1"/&gt; J Dallas Dort decided to retire and liquidated Dort Motor Car Company in 1924 and died the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Naldrett, ''Lost Car Companies of Detroit'', History Press, Charleston S C, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associates==
===A.B.C. Hardy's Flint Automobile Company===
Alexander Brownell Cullen Hardy (1869-1948) began working at Durant-Dort in 1889.&lt;ref name="bagm"&gt;{{cite book|title=Billy, Alfred, and General Motors: The Story of Two Unique Men, a Legendary Company, and a Remarkable Time in American History |first=William |last=Pelfrey |publisher=AMACOM |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8144-0869-8|pages=83–85; 95–96; 106|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HYFIiIll2eIC&amp;pg=PA83 |accessdate=April 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1895, he was supervising production of the Diamond, a low-cost buggy. In 1898, J. Dallas Dort took a two-year leave of absence from his position as president of Durant-Dort, and Hardy stepped into his place.&lt;ref name="bagm"/&gt; After Dort's return in 1900, Hardy took his own leave of absence, and while touring Europe discovered the automobile. On his return, he supposedly told Durant to "get out of the carriage business before the automobile ruins you."&lt;ref name="bagm"/&gt; Although Durant didn't act at the time, Hardy struck out on his own and established the [[Flint Automobile Company]], Flint's first automotive manufacturer, in 1901. However, the company's Roadster failed to distinguish itself from the popular, lower-priced [[Oldsmobile]], and in 1903 the Flint Automobile Company folded.&lt;ref name="bagm"/&gt; Hardy returned to Durant-Dort and wound up as vice-president of General Motors until his retirement in 1925.

===Flint Wagon Works and Buick===
Durant began to lose interest in Flint activities and set up an office in New York. A.B.C. Hardy tried to interest him in automobiles. Eventually James Whiting of [[Flint Wagon Works]] persuaded Durant to take what became a consuming interest in Flint Wagon Works' [[Buick]] automobile venture. Durant used his own capital and that of Durant-Dort to buy control of Buick. David Buick, already a minority partner in his own business, was left with a single share of his enterprise.&lt;ref name="bagm"/&gt; However, Durant agreed to keep Buick on as an employee, and Buick remained with the firm until 1906, when Durant bought out his single share for $100,000.&lt;ref name="bagm"/&gt;

===McLaughlin Carriage Company===
Other automobile pioneers were associated with the Durant-Dort Carriage Company. [[Sam McLaughlin|R. S. McLaughlin]] headed the [[McLaughlin Motor Car Company]] in [[Oshawa, Ontario]]. Its carriage builder parent was started in 1867 and by 1900 built more carriages than any other Canadian business. W. C. Durant and his Canadian-born son-in-law and business confidant, Dr. Edwin Campbell, were friends with the McLaughlins and they made cross stock-holdings in each other's automobile businesses. Campbell was a school friend of R. S. McLaughlin.

===Nash Motors===
[[Charles Williams Nash|Charles W. Nash]] began working at Durant-Dort in 1891 working in the cushion department, but soon worked his way up to foreman, and, by 1898, factory superintendent.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite book|title=Storied Independent Automakers: Nash, Hudson, and American Motors |first=Charles K. |last=Hyde |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8143-3446-1 |pages=24–28|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PerGbKxOPZYC&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=April 7, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nash was named a director and vice-president of the firm in 1900, a position he held until 1913.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; In 1910, Nash was hired as general manager of General Motors, and in 1917 founded [[Nash Motors]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18349">'''Effective radiated power''' ('''ERP'''), synonymous with '''equivalent radiated power''',  is an [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] standardized definition of directional [[radio frequency]] (RF) power, such as that emitted by a [[radio transmitter]].  It is the total [[Power (physics)|power]] in [[watt (unit)|watt]]s that would have to be radiated by a [[dipole antenna|half-wave dipole antenna]] to give the same radiation intensity (signal strength in watts per square meter) as the actual source at a distant receiver located in the direction of the antenna's strongest beam ([[main lobe]]).  ERP measures the combination of the power emitted by the transmitter and the ability of the antenna to direct that power in a given direction.   It is equal to the input power to the antenna multiplied by the [[antenna gain|gain]] of the antenna.  It is used in electronics and [[telecommunication]]s, particularly in [[broadcasting]] to quantify the apparent power of a [[broadcasting station]] experienced by listeners in its reception area.

An alternate parameter that measures the same thing is '''effective (or equivalent) isotropic radiated power''' ('''EIRP''').  Effective isotropic radiated power is the total power that would have to be radiated by a hypothetical [[isotropic antenna]] to give the same signal strength as the actual source in the direction of the antenna's strongest beam.  The difference between EIRP and ERP is that ERP compares the actual antenna to a half-wave dipole antenna, while EIRP compares it to a theoretical isotropic antenna.  Since a half-wave dipole antenna has a gain of 1.64, or 2.15 [[decibel]]s compared to an isotropic radiator, if ERP and EIRP are expressed in watts their relation is 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP(W)} =  1.64 \cdot \mathrm{ERP(W)}&lt;/math&gt;
If they are expressed in decibels
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP(dB)} = \mathrm{ERP(dB)} + 2.15&lt;/math&gt;

== Definitions ==
Effective radiated power and effective isotropic radiated power both measure the amount of power a radio transmitter and antenna (or other source of electromagnetic waves) radiates in a specific direction: in the direction of maximum signal strength (the "[[main lobe]]") of its radiation pattern.&lt;ref name="NAB"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This maximum radiated power is dependent on two factors: the total power output and the [[radiation pattern]] of the antenna – how much of that power is radiated in the desired direction. The latter factor is quantified by the [[antenna gain]], which is the ratio of the signal strength radiated by an antenna to that radiated by a standard antenna.  For example, a 1,000-watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 4 (6 dBi) will have the same signal strength in the direction of its main lobe, and thus the same ERP and EIRP, as a 4,000-watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 1 (0 dBi).  So ERP and EIRP are measures of radiated power that can compare different combinations of transmitters and antennas on an equal basis.

The difference between ERP and EIRP is that antenna gain has traditionally been measured in two different units, comparing the antenna to two different standard antennas; an [[isotropic antenna]] and a [[half-wave dipole]] antenna:  
*''Isotropic gain'' is the ratio of the power density &lt;math&gt;S_\text{max}&lt;/math&gt; (signal strength in watts per square meter) received at a point far from the antenna (in the [[far field]]) in the direction of its maximum radiation (main lobe), to the power &lt;math&gt;S_\text{max,isotropic}&lt;/math&gt; received at the same point from a hypothetical lossless [[isotropic antenna]], which radiates equal power in all directions 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}_\text{i} = {S_\text{max}  \over S_\text{max,isotropic}}&lt;/math&gt;
:Gain is often expressed in logarithmic units of [[decibel]]s (dB).  The decibel gain relative to an isotropic antenna (dBi) is given by
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}\text{(dBi)} = 10\log{S_\text{max}  \over S_\text{max,isotropic}}&lt;/math&gt;
*''Dipole gain'' is the ratio of the power density received from the antenna in the direction of its maximum radiation to the power density &lt;math&gt;S_\text{max,dipole}&lt;/math&gt; received from a lossless [[half-wave dipole]] antenna in the direction of its maximum radiation
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}_\text{d} = {S_\text{max}  \over S_\text{max,dipole}}&lt;/math&gt;
:The decibel gain relative to a dipole (dBd) is given by
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}\text{(dBd)} = 10\log{S_\text{max}  \over S_\text{max,dipole}}&lt;/math&gt;
In contrast to an isotropic antenna, the dipole has a "donut-shaped" radiation pattern, its radiated power is maximum in directions perpendicular to the antenna, declining to zero on the antenna axis.  Since the radiation of the dipole is concentrated in horizontal directions,  the gain of a half-wave dipole is greater than that of an isotropic antenna.  The isotropic gain of a half-wave dipole is 1.64, or in decibels 10 log 1.64 = 2.15 dBi, so
:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{i} =  1.64G_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt; 
In decibels
:&lt;math&gt;G\text{(dBi)} = G\text{(dBd)} + 2.15&lt;/math&gt;

The two measures EIRP and ERP are based on the two different standard antennas above:&lt;ref name="NAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seybold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weik" /&gt;
*EIRP is defined as the RMS power input in watts required to a lossless [[isotropic antenna]]  to give the same maximum power density far from the antenna as the actual transmitter. It is equal to the power input to the transmitter's antenna multiplied by the isotropic antenna gain
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP} = G_\text{i} P_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt;
:The ERP and EIRP are also often expressed in [[decibel]]s (dB).  The input power in decibels is usually calculated with comparison to a reference level of one [[watt (unit)|watt]] (W): &lt;math&gt;P_\text{in}\mathrm{(dBw)} = 10 \log P_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since multiplication of two factors is equivalent to addition of their decibel values
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP(dBw)} = G\text{(dBi)} + P_\text{in}\mathrm{(dBw)}&lt;/math&gt;

*ERP is defined as the RMS power input in watts required to a lossless [[half-wave dipole]] antenna to give the same maximum power density far from the antenna as the actual transmitter. It is equal to the power input to the transmitter's antenna multiplied by the antenna gain relative to a half-wave dipole
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ERP} = G_\text{d} P_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt;
:In decibels
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ERP(dBw)} = G\text{(dBd)} + P_\text{in}\mathrm{(dBw)}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the two definitions of gain only differ by a constant factor, so do ERP and EIRP
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP(W)} =  1.64 \cdot \mathrm{ERP(W)}&lt;/math&gt; 
In decibels
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP(dBw)} =\mathrm{ERP}\text{(dBw)} + 2.15&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to transmitter output power==
The transmitter is usually connected to the antenna through a [[transmission line]]. Since the transmission line may have significant losses &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, the power applied to the antenna is usually less than the output power of the transmitter &lt;math&gt;P_\text{TX}&lt;/math&gt;.  The relation of ERP and EIRP to transmitter output power is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP(dBw)} =  P_\text{TX}\mathrm{(dBw)} - L\mathrm{(dB)} +  G\text{(dBi)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ERP(dBw)} =  P_\text{TX}\mathrm{(dBw)} - L\mathrm{(dB)} +  G\text{(dBi)} - 2.15&lt;/math&gt;
Losses in the antenna itself are included in the gain.

== Antenna gain and directivity ==
Antenna gain is closely related to directivity and often incorrectly used interchangeably.  However, gain is always less than directivity by a factor called radiation efficiency, η.  Whereas directivity is entirely a function of wavelength and the geometry and type of antenna, gain takes into account the losses that always occur within a real antenna.  Specifically, accelerating charge (time varying current) causes electromagnetic radiation per [[Maxwell's equations]].  Therefore, antennas use a current distribution on radiating elements to generate electromagnetic energy that propagates away from the antenna.  This coupling is never 100% efficient (by [[Laws of thermodynamics|Laws of Thermodynamics]]), and therefore antenna gain will always be less than directivity by this efficiency factor.

== Dipole vs. isotropic radiators ==
Because ERP is calculated as antenna gain (in a given direction) as compared with the maximum directivity of a half-wave [[dipole antenna]], it creates a mathematically virtual effective dipole antenna oriented in the direction of the receiver.  In other words, a notional receiver in a given direction from the transmitter would receive the same power if the source were replaced with an ideal dipole oriented with maximum directivity and matched [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] towards the receiver and with an antenna input power equal to the ERP.  The receiver would not be able to determine a difference.  Maximum directivity of an ideal half-wave dipole is a constant, i.e., 0 dBd = 2.15 dBi.  Therefore, ERP is always 2.15&amp;nbsp;dB less than EIRP.  The ideal dipole antenna could be further replaced by an isotropic radiator (a purely mathematical device which cannot exist in the real world), and the receiver cannot know the difference so long as the input power is increased by 2.15&amp;nbsp;dB.

Unfortunately, the distinction between dBd and dBi is often left unstated and the reader is sometimes forced to infer which was used.  For example, a [[Yagi-Uda antenna]] is constructed from several dipoles arranged at precise intervals to create better energy focusing (directivity) than a simple dipole.  Since it is constructed from dipoles, often its antenna gain is expressed in dBd, but listed only as dB.  Obviously this ambiguity is undesirable with respect to engineering specifications.  A Yagi-Uda antenna's maximum directivity is 8.77 dBd = 10.92 dBi.  Its gain necessarily must be less than this by the factor η, which must be negative in units of dB.  Neither ERP nor EIRP can be calculated without knowledge of the power accepted by the antenna, i.e., it is not correct to use units of dBd or dBi with ERP and EIRP.  Let us assume a 100-watt (20 dBW) transmitter with losses of 6&amp;nbsp;dB prior to the antenna.  ERP &lt; 22.77dBW and EIRP &lt; 24.92dBW, both less than ideal by η in dB.  Assuming that the receiver is in the first side-lobe of the transmitting antenna, and each value is further reduced by 7.2&amp;nbsp;dB, which is the decrease in directivity from the main to side-lobe of a Yagi-Uda.  Therefore, anywhere along the side-lobe direction from this transmitter, a blind receiver could not tell the difference if a Yagi-Uda was replaced with either an ideal dipole (oriented towards the receiver) or an isotropic radiator with antenna input power increased by 1.57&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Field and Wave Electromagnetics, 2nd Ed.|last=Cheng|first=David K.|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=648–650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polarization ==
Polarization has not been taken into account so far, but it must be properly clarified.  When considering the dipole radiator previously we assumed that it was perfectly aligned with the receiver.  Now assume, however, that the receiving antenna is circularly polarized, and there will be a minimum 3&amp;nbsp;dB polarization loss regardless of antenna orientation.  If the receiver is also a dipole, it is possible to align it orthogonally to the transmitter such that theoretically zero energy is received.  However, this polarization loss is not accounted for in the calculation of ERP or EIRP.  Rather, the receiving system designer must account for this loss as appropriate.  For example, a cellular telephone tower has a fixed linear polarization, but the mobile handset must function well at any arbitrary orientation.  Therefore, a handset design might provide dual polarization receive on the handset so that captured energy is maximized regardless of orientation, or the designer might use a circularly polarized antenna and account for the extra 3&amp;nbsp;dB of loss with amplification.

== FM example ==
[[Image:Antenna-tower-collinear-et-al.jpg|thumb|130px|An antenna tower consisting of a high-gain [[collinear antenna array]].]]
For example, an [[frequency modulation|FM]] [[radio station]] which [[advertise]]s that it has 100,000 [[watt]]s of power actually has 100,000 watts ERP, and ''not'' an actual 100,000-watt transmitter.  The [[transmitter power output]] (TPO) of such a station typically may be 10,000 to 20,000 watts, with a gain factor of 5 to 10 (5× to 10×, or 7 to 10 [[Decibel|dB]]).  In most antenna designs, gain is realized primarily by concentrating power toward the [[horizontal plane]] and suppressing it at upward and downward angles, through the use of [[phased array]]s of antenna elements.  The distribution of power versus [[elevation angle]] is known as the vertical pattern.  When an antenna is also directional horizontally, gain and ERP will vary with [[azimuth]] ([[compass]] direction).  Rather than the [[average]] power over all directions, it is the apparent power in the direction of the antenna's main lobe that is quoted as a station's ERP (this statement is just another way of stating the definition of ERP).  This is particularly applicable to the huge ERPs reported for [[shortwave]] broadcasting stations, which use very narrow [[beam width]]s to get their signals across [[continent]]s and [[ocean]]s.

=== United States regulatory usage ===
ERP for FM radio in the United States is always relative to a theoretical [[Dipole antenna#Dipole as a reference standard|reference half-wave dipole]] antenna. (That is, when calculating ERP, the most direct approach is to work with antenna gain in dBd). To deal with antenna polarization, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) lists ERP in both the horizontal and vertical [[measurement]]s for FM and TV.  Horizontal is the standard for both, but if the vertical ERP is larger it will be used instead.

The maximum ERP for US FM broadcasting is usually 100,000 watts (FM Zone II) or 50,000 watts (in the generally more densely populated Zones I and I-A), though exact restrictions vary depending on the class of license and the [[Height above average terrain|antenna height above average terrain (HAAT)]].&lt;ref&gt;47 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 73.211&lt;/ref&gt;  Some stations have been [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] in or, very infrequently, been given a [[waiver]], and can exceed normal restrictions.

== Microwave band issues ==
For most [[microwave]] systems, a completely non-directional [[isotropic antenna]] (one which [[Radiation|radiates]] equally and perfectly well in every direction &amp;ndash; a physical impossibility) is used as a reference antenna, and then one speaks of [[EIRP]] (effective ''isotropic'' radiated power) rather than ERP.  This includes [[satellite]] [[transponder]]s, radar, and other systems which use microwave dishes and reflectors rather than dipole-style antennas.

== Lower-frequency issues ==
In the case of [[medium wave]] (AM) stations in the [[United States]], power limits are set to the actual transmitter power output, and ERP is not used in normal calculations. Omnidirectional antennas used by a number of stations radiate the signal equally in all directions. Directional arrays are used to protect co- or adjacent channel stations, usually at night, but some run directionally 24 hours. While antenna efficiency and ground conductivity are taken into account when designing such an array, the FCC database shows the station's transmitter power output, not ERP.

== Related terms ==
'''Effective monopole radiated power''' (EMRP) may be used in Europe, particularly in relation to [[mediumwave]] broadcasting antennas.  This is the same as ERP, except that a short vertical antenna (i.e. a short [[Monopole antenna|monopole]]) is used as the reference antenna instead of a half-wave [[dipole]].

== HAAT ==
{{main article|Height above average terrain}}
The height above average terrain for VHF and higher frequencies is extremely important when considering ERP, as the signal coverage ([[broadcast range]]) produced by a given ERP dramatically increases with antenna height.  Because of this, it is possible for a station of only a few hundred watts ERP to cover more area than a station of a few thousand watts ERP, if its signal travels above obstructions on the ground.

'''Electricity pricing''' (sometimes referred to as '''electricity tariff''' or the '''price of electricity''') varies widely from country to country and may vary significantly from locality to locality within a particular country. Many factors go into determining an electricity tariff, such as the price of power generation, government subsidies, local weather patterns, transmission and distribution infrastructure, and industry regulation.  “Electricity prices generally reflect the cost to build, finance, maintain, and operate power plants and the electricity grid.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=electricity_factors_affecting_prices|title=Factors Affecting Electricity Prices - Energy Explained, Your Guide To Understanding Energy - Energy Information Administration|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some utilities are for-profit, and their prices will also include a financial return for shareholders and owners.  Electricity tariffs vary by type of customer, typically by residential, commercial, and industrial connections.  Electricity price forecasting is the method by which a generator, utility company, or large industrial consumer can predict the wholesale prices of electricity with reasonable accuracy.  The cost to supply electricity varies minute by minute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
{{toclimit|3}}

==Rate structure==
In standard [[Regulated Monopoly|regulated monopoly]] markets, electricity rates typically vary for residential, commercial and industrial customers. The rates are determined through a regulatory process that is overseen by a public utility commission.

Prices for any single class of electricity customer can vary by [[Electricity meter#Time of day metering|time-of-day]] called TOU or time of use or by the capacity or nature of the supply circuit (e.g., 5 [[kilowatt|kW]], 12&amp;nbsp;kW, 18&amp;nbsp;kW, 24&amp;nbsp;kW are typical in some of the large developed countries); for industrial customers, single-phase vs. 3-phase, etc.  Prices are usually highest for commercial and residential consumers because of the additional costs associated with stepping down their distribution voltage.  The price of power for industrial customers is relatively the same as the wholesale price of electricity, because they consume more power at higher voltages. Supplying electricity at transmission-level high voltages is more efficient, and therefore less expensive.

The two most common distinctions between customer classes are load size and usage profile.  In many cases, time-of-use (TOU) and load factor are more significant factors than load size.  Contribution to peak-load is an extremely important factor in determining customer rate class.  Consumer loads may be characterized as peak, off-peak, baseload, and seasonal. Utilities rate each load differently, because each has different implications for a power system.

The inclusion of renewable energy distributed generation and AMI in the modern electricity grid has introduced many alternative rate structures.  Simple (or fixed) rate, tiered (or step) rate, TOU, demand rates, tiered within TOU, seasonal, and weekend/holiday rates are among the few residential rate structures offered by modern utilities.  The simple rate charges a specific dollar per kilowatt ($/kWh) consumed.  The tiered rate is one of the more common residential rate programs, and it charges a higher rate as customer usage increases. TOU and demand rates are structured to help maintain/control a utility’s peak demand.  The concept at its core is to discourage customers from contributing to peak-load times by charging them more money to use power at that time.

A feed-in tariff (FIT) is an energy-supply policy that supports the development of renewable power generation.  FITs give financial benefits to renewable power producers.  In the United States, FIT policies guarantee that eligible renewable generators will have their electricity purchased by their utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/slsc/feed-tariff-resources|title=Feed-in Tariff Resources {{!}} Department of Energy|website=www.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FIT contract contains a guaranteed period of time (usually 15–20 years) that payments in dollars per kilowatt hour ($/kWh) will be made for the full output of the system.

Net metering is another billing mechanism that supports the development of renewable power generation, specifically, solar power. The mechanism credits solar energy system owners for the electricity their system adds to the grid. Residential customers with rooftop PV system will typically generate more electricity than their home consumes during daylight hours, so net metering is particularly advantageous. During this time where generation is greater than consumption, the home’s electricity meter will run backwards to provide a credit on the homeowner’s electricity bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seia.org/initiatives/net-metering|title=Net Metering {{!}} SEIA|website=SEIA|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cost of electricity by source|cost also differs by the power source]].  The net present value of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a generating asset is known as the levelized cost of electricity ([[Cost of electricity by source|LCOE]]).  LCOE is the best value to compare different methods of generation on a consistent basis.

In the U.S. the estimated LCOE for different sources are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 2017|title=Lazard’s Levelized Cost Of Energy Analysis|url=|journal=|volume=11.0|pages=2|via=Lazard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Price comparison==
The table below shows simple comparison of electricity tariffs in industrialised countries and territories around the world, expressed in US dollars. The comparison does not take into account factors including fluctuating [[exchange rates|international exchange rates]], a country's [[purchasing power parity|purchasing power]], [[subsidies|government electricity subsidies]] or retail discounts that are often available in [[Electricity retailing#Creating a market|deregulated electricity markets]].&lt;ref name="pepei"/&gt;

For example, in 2012, [[Hawaii]] residents had the highest average residential electricity rate in the [[United States]] (37.34¢/kWh), while [[Louisiana]] residents had the lowest average residential electricity costs (8.37¢/kWh). Even in the [[contiguous United States]] the gap is significant, with [[New York (state)|New York]] residents having the highest average residential electricity rates in the lower 48 U.S. states (17.62¢/kWh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricitylocal.com/resources/statistics/|title=Electricity Rates and Usage in the United States|publisher=Electricity Local|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity price forecasting==
Electricity price forecasting is the process of using [[mathematical model]]s to predict what electricity prices will be in the future.

===Forecasting methodology===
The simplest model for day ahead forecasting is to ask each generation source to bid on blocks of generation and choose the cheapest bids. If not enough bids are submitted, the price is increased. If too many bids are submitted the price can reach zero or become negative. The offer price includes the generation cost as well as the transmission cost, along with any profit. Power can be sold or purchased from adjoining [[power pool]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140304044724/http://isoexpress.iso-ne.com/guest-hub ISO NE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyiso.com/public/markets_operations/market_data/maps/|title=NY ISO Zone Maps|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ercot.com/content/cdr/contours/damSpp1Hg.html|publisher=ERCOT|title=LMP Contour Map: Day-Ahead Market - Settlement Point Pricing|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of independent system operators (ISOs) fosters competition for generation among wholesale market participants by unbundling operation of transmission and generation.

Wind and solar power are non-[[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]]. Such power is normally sold before any other bids, at a pre-determined rate for each supplier. Any excess is sold to another grid operator, or stored, using [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]], or in the worst case, curtailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwig.org/windinmarketstableOct2011.pdf|title=Wind Power and Electricity Markets|year=2011|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curtailment could potentially significantly impact solar power’s economic and environmental benefits at greater PV penetration levels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/confronting-duck-curve-how-address-over-generation-solar-energy|title=Confronting the Duck Curve: How to Address Over-Generation of Solar Energy|website=Energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allocation is done by bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eirgrid.com/media/IFA+Overview.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=August 16, 2011|publisher=Eirgrid|accessdate=May 14, 2017|df=mdy-all}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of the recent introduction of smart grids and integrating distributed renewable generation has been increased uncertainty of future supply, demand and prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-01-01|title=Recent advances in electricity price forecasting: A review of probabilistic forecasting|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032117308808|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|language=en|volume=81|pages=1548–1568|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.234|issn=1364-0321}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This uncertainty has driven much research into the topic of forecasting.

===Driving factors===
Electricity cannot be stored as easily as gas, it is produced at the exact moment of demand.  All of the factors of supply and demand will therefore have an immediate impact on the price of electricity on the spot market.  In addition to production [[cost of electricity by source|costs]], electricity prices are set by supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordpoolspot.com/How-does-it-work/|title=The power market|publisher=Nord Pool Spot|accessdate=June 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606010200/http://nordpoolspot.com/How-does-it-work/|archive-date=June 6, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some fundamental drivers are the most likely to be considered.

Short-term prices are impacted the most by weather.  Demand due to heating in the winter and cooling in the summer are the main drivers for seasonal price spikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.appienergy.com/news-and-resources/news/six-key-factors-driving-gas-and-electricity-prices/|title=Six Key Factors Driving Gas and Electricity Prices {{!}} APPI Energy|website=www.appienergy.com|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, the United States is scheduled to add 13 GW of natural-gas fired generation to its capacity.  Additional natural-gas fired capacity is driving down the price of electricity, and increasing demand.

A country’s natural resource endowment, as well as their regulations in place greatly influence tariffs from the supply side.  The supply side of the electricity supply is most influenced by fuel prices, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allowance prices.  The EU carbon prices have doubled since 2017, making it a significant driving factor of price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.platts.com/latest-news/electric-power/london/eu-co2-allowance-prices-continue-to-climb-hit-21492332|title=EU CO2 allowance prices continue to climb, hit Eur10.60/mt - Electric Power {{!}} Platts News Article &amp; Story|website=www.platts.com|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weather====
Studies show that generally demand for [[electricity]] is driven largely by [[temperature]]. [[Heating]] demand in the [[winter]] and cooling demand ([[air conditioner]]s) in the [[summer]] are what primarily drive the seasonal peaks in most regions. [[Heating degree day]]s and [[cooling degree day]]s help measure energy consumption by referencing the outdoor temperature above and below 65 [[degree (temperature)|degrees]] [[Fahrenheit]], a commonly accepted baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amstat.org/PUBLICATIONS/JSE/datasets/utility.txt|title=What Does It Take to Heat a New Room?|author=Robert Carver|publisher=American Statistical Association|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of renewable sources like solar and wind, weather impacts supply.  California’s duck curve[cite] shows the difference between electricity demand and the amount of solar energy available throughout the day.  On a sunny day, solar power floods the electricity generation market and then drops during sunless evening, when electricity demand peaks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Hydropower availability====
[[Snowpack]], [[streamflow]]s, seasonality, [[salmon]], etc. all affect the amount of water that can flow through a [[dam]] at any given time. Forecasting these variables predicts the available potential energy for a dam for a given period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100119074756.htm|title=More Reliable Forecasts for Water Flows Can Reduce Price of Electricity|date=January 19, 2010|work=Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regions such as the Egypt, [[Three Gorges Dam|China]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]] get significant generation from [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dams.  In 2015, SAIDI and SAIFI more than doubled from the previous year in Zambia due to low water reserves in their hydroelectric dams caused by insufficient rainfall.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;J. Arlet. 2017. “Electricity sector constraints for firms across economies : a comparative analysis.” ''Doing business research notes;'' no.1. Washington, D.C. : World Bank Group. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/409771499690745091/Electricity-sector-constraints-for-firms-across-economies-a-comparative-analysis&lt;/nowiki&gt; p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Power plant and transmission outages ====
Whether planned or unplanned, outages affect the total amount of power that is available to the grid.  Outages undermine electricity supply, which in turn effects price.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Economic health====
During times of economic hardship, many factories cut back production due to a reduction of consumer demand and therefore reduce production-related electrical demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regulationbodyofknowledge.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Mehra_Demand_Forecasting_for.pdf|title=Demand Forecasting for Electricity|work=Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global Markets'''

The UK has been a net importer of energy for over a decade, and as their generation capacity and reserves decrease the level of importing is reaching an all-time high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grubb|first=Michael|last2=Drummond|first2=Paul|date=February 2018|title=Uk Industrial Electricity Prices: Competitiveness In A Low Carbon World|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/sustainable/sites/bartlett/files/uk_industrial_electricity_prices_-_competitiveness_in_a_low_carbon_world.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=Aldersgate Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their fuel price's dependence on international markets has a huge effect on the cost of electricity, especially if the exchange rate falls.  Being energy dependent makes their electricity prices vulnerable to world events, as well.

'''Government Regulation'''

Governments may choose to make electricity tariffs affordable for their population through subsidies to producers and consumers.  Most countries characterized as having low energy access have electric power utilities that do not recover any of their capital and operating costs, due to high subsidy levels.&lt;ref&gt;C. Trimble, M. Kojima, I. Perez Arroyo, F. Mohammadzadeh. 2016. “Financial Viability of Electricity Sectors in Sub-Saharan Africa: Quasi-Fiscal Deficits and Hidden Costs.” Policy Research Working Paper; No. 7788.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, federal interventions and subsidies for energy can be classified as tax expenditure, direct expenditures, research and development (R&amp;D), and DOE loan guarantees.  Most federal subsidies in 2016 were to support developing renewable energy supplies, and energy efficiency measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/subsidy/|title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power quality===
Excessive [[Total harmonic distortion|Total Harmonic Distortions]] (THD) and not unity Power Factor (PF) is costly at every level of the electricity market. Cost of PF and THD impact is difficult to estimate, but both can potentially cause heat, vibrations, malfunctioning and even meltdowns.  Power factor is the ratio of real to apparent power in a power system.  Drawing more current results in a lower power factor.  Larger currents require costlier infrastructure to minimize power loss, so consumers with low power factors get charged a higher electricity rate by their utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motioncontrolonline.org/content-detail.cfm/Motion-Control-Technical-Features/Understanding-Power-Factor-and-Harmonics/content_id/1545|title=MCMA - Motion Control Online|website=MCMA - Motion Control Online|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  True power factor is made of displacement power factor and THD.  Power quality is typically monitored at the transmission level. A spectrum of compensation devices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_2/chpt_11/4.html|title=Practical Power Factor Correction : Power Factor - Electronics Textbook|publisher=All About Circuits|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; mitigate bad outcomes, but improvements can be achieved only with real-time correction devices (old style switching type,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Speed Real Time Automatic Power Factor Correction System|url=http://www.excelelectronics.co.in/pdf/RTPFC.pdf|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; modern low-speed DSP driven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transcoil.com/Products/HGA-Active-Harmonic-Filter.htm|title=TCI, LLC - HGA 5% Active Harmonic Filter|publisher=TransCoil|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and near real-time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3dfs.com/|title=3DFS Software Defined Power|publisher=3DFS|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Most modern devices reduce problems, while maintaining [[return on investment]] and significant reduction of ground currents.  Power quality problems can cause erroneous responses from many kinds of analog and digital equipment, where the response could be unpredictable.

===Phase balancing===
Most common distribution network and generation is done with 3 phase structures, with special attention paid to the phase balancing and resulting reduction of ground current. It is true for industrial or commercial networks where most power is used in 3 phase machines, but light commercial and residential users do not have real-time phase balancing capabilities. Often this issue leads to unexpected equipment behavior or malfunctions and in extreme cases fires. For example, sensitive professional analogue or digital recording equipment must be connected to well-balanced and grounded power networks. To determine and mitigate the cost of the unbalanced electricity network, electric companies in most cases charge by demand or as a separate category for heavy unbalanced loads. A few simple techniques are available for balancing that require fast computing and real-time modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecmweb.com/power-quality/saving-energy-through-load-balancing-and-scheduling|title=Saving Energy Through Load Balancing and Scheduling|publisher=Electrical Construction &amp; Maintenance|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aerogelbrick.jpg|thumb|A 2.5 kg brick is supported on top of a piece of aerogel weighing only 2 grams]]
'''FOGBANK''' is a code name given to a material used in nuclear weapons such as the [[W76]], [[W78]] and [[W80 (nuclear warhead)|W80]].&lt;ref name=ACW&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/1814/fogbank |title=FOGBANK |author=Jeffrey Lewis |work=Arms Control Wonk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FOGBANK's precise nature is classified; in the words of former [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] general manager [[Dennis Ruddy]], "The material is classified. Its composition is classified. Its use in the weapon is classified, and the process itself is classified."&lt;ref name=WS2009/&gt; [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] Nuclear Explosive Safety documents simply describe it as a material "used in [[nuclear weapon]]s and nuclear explosives" along with [[lithium hydride]] (LiH) and [[lithium deuteride]] (LiD), [[beryllium]] (Be), [[uranium hydride]] (UH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[plutonium hydride]].

However [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] (NNSA) Administrator [[Thomas P. D'Agostino|Tom D’Agostino]] disclosed the role of FOGBANK in the weapon: "There's another material in the—it's called interstage material, also known as fog bank", and arms experts believe that FOGBANK is an [[aerogel]] material which acts as an [[nuclear weapon design#Interstage|interstage material]] in a nuclear warhead; i.e., a material designed to become a superheated [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] following the detonation of the weapon's fission stage, the plasma then triggering the fusion-stage detonation.&lt;ref name=WS2009/&gt;

==History==
It has been revealed by unclassified official sources that FOGBANK was originally manufactured in Facility 9404-11 of the [[Y-12 National Security Complex]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] from 1975 until 1989, when the final batch of W76 warheads was completed. After that the facility was mothballed, and finally slated for decommissioning by 1993. Only a small [[pilot plant]] was left, which had been used to produce small batches of FOGBANK for testing purposes.&lt;ref name=WS2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Last | first = Jonathan V. | title = The Fog of War: Forgetting what we once knew | journal = [[The Weekly Standard]] | volume = 14 | issue = 33 | date = 18 May 2009 |url = https://www.weeklystandard.com/jonathan-v-last/the-fog-of-war}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the US government decided that large numbers of its nuclear weapons would require replacement, refurbishing, or decommissioning. Accordingly, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] set up a refurbishment program aimed at extending the [[service life|service lives]] of older nuclear weapons. In 2000, the NNSA specified a life-extension program for W76 warheads that would enable them to remain in service until at least 2040.&lt;ref name=WS2009/&gt;

It was soon realized that the FOGBANK material was a potential source of problems for the program, as few records of its manufacturing process had been retained when it was originally manufactured in the 1980s, and nearly all staff members who had expertise in its production had either retired or left the agency. The NNSA briefly investigated sourcing a substitute for FOGBANK, but eventually decided that since FOGBANK had been produced previously, they would be able to repeat it.&lt;ref name=WS2009/&gt; Additionally, "Los Alamos computer simulations at that time were not sophisticated enough to determine conclusively that an alternate material would function as effectively as Fogbank," according to a Los Alamos publication.&lt;ref name="FogbankLostKnowledge"&gt;"[http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/padwp/pdfs/nwj2_09.pdf Fogbank: Lost Knowledge Regained]," (Los Alamos) ''Nuclear Weapons Journal'' no. 2 (2009), 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacture involves the moderately toxic, highly volatile [[solvent]] [[acetonitrile]], which presents a hazard for workers (causing three evacuations in March 2006 alone).&lt;ref name=ACW/&gt;

With Facility 9404-11 long since decommissioned, a brand new production facility was required. Delays arose during its construction, and in addition, engineers repeatedly encountered failure in their efforts to produce FOGBANK. As one deadline after the other expired, and the schedule was pushed back again and again, the NNSA eventually decided to invest $23 million to attempt to find an alternative to FOGBANK.&lt;ref name=WS2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/mar/06/military.greenpolitics |title=Technical hitch delays renewal of nuclear warheads for Trident |author=Ian Sample |work=The Guardian |date=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726464.700-trident-missiles-delayed-by-mystery-ingredient.html |title=Trident missiles delayed by mystery ingredient |author=Rob Edwards |date=12 March 2008 |issue=2646 |page=15}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, engineers finally devised a manufacturing process for FOGBANK. Unfortunately, the material turned out to have problems when tested, and in September 2007 the FOGBANK project was upgraded to "Code Blue" status by the NNSA, making it a major priority.&lt;ref name=WS2009/&gt; In 2008, following the expenditure of a further $69 million, the NNSA finally managed to manufacture FOGBANK, and 7 months later, the first refurbished warhead was handed over to the US Navy, nearly a decade after the commencement of the refurbishment program.&lt;ref name=WS2009/&gt; However, in May 2009 a US Navy spokesman said that they had not received any refurbished weapons to date. The Energy Department stated that the current plan was to begin shipping refurbished weapons in the fall of 2009, two years behind schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0458-3035| last = Ralph Vartabedian | title = Program to refurbish aging nuclear warheads faces setbacks| work = The Los Angeles Times| accessdate = 2009-05-30| date = 2009-05-29| url = http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-broken-warheads29-2009may29,0,787677.story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of [[reverse engineering]] FOGBANK produced some improvements in scientific knowledge of the process. The new production scientists noticed that certain problems in production resembled those noted by the original team. These problems were traced to a particular impurity in the final product that was required to meet quality standards. A root cause investigation showed that input materials were subject to cleaning processes that had not existed during the original production run. This cleaning removed a substance that generated the required impurity. With the implicit role of this substance finally understood, the production scientists can control output quality better than during the original run.&lt;ref name="FogbankLostKnowledge"&gt;"[http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/padwp/pdfs/nwj2_09.pdf Fogbank: Lost Knowledge Regained]," (Los Alamos) ''Nuclear Weapons Journal'' no. 2 (2009), 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3700">'''Fluff pulp''' (also called '''comminution pulp''' or '''fluffy pulp''') is a type of [[chemical pulp]] made from long fibre [[softwood]]s. Important parameters for fluff pulp are bulk and water absorbency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Nanko | first = Hirko |author2=Button, Allan |author3=Hillman, Dave | title = The World of Market Pulp | publisher = WOMP, LLC | year = 2005 | location = Appleton, WI, USA | page = 5 | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 0-615-13013-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fluff pulp was first developed for use in disposable [[sanitary napkin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inda.org/events/training/reading/SuggestedReadings/Fiber%20Fundamental%20Fluff%20Pulp.pdf |title=Fibre Fundamentals - Fluff Pulp |last1= Moore |first1= Dan |last2= |first2= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kotex]] first advertisement for products made with wood pulp (Cellucotton) appeared in 1921.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.mum.org/CuradsKotexads.htm Inside the Museum of Menstruation 6&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Disposable diaper producers also were early to convert to fluff pulp because of its low cost and high absorbency. Normal usage of fluff pulp in a diaper was about 55 grams. In the 1980s started the commercialization of [[air-laid paper]], which gave better bulk, porosity, strength, softness and water absorption properties compared with normal [[tissue paper]]. Also in the 1980s started the use of [[Superabsorbent polymer|superabsorbents]] in diapers and reduced the need for fluff pulp and is now down to 15 grams or even less. The demand of the pulp in diapers has gone from being the absorbent of liquid to giving the products dry and [[wet strength]].

==Manufacture==
{{main|Kraft process}}
{{see also|Sulfite process}}

More than 90% of the fluff pulps are fully bleached chemical softwood pulps, of which more than 90% are kraft pulps.

The most common raw material source for fluff pulps are southern bleached softwood kraft ([[SBSK (pulp)|SBSK]]) from [[loblolly pine]]. SBSK from other species and [[NBSK]] are also used to make fluff pulp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Nanko | first = Hirko |author2=Button, Allan |author3=Hillman, Dave | title = The World of Market Pulp | publisher = WOMP, LLC | year = 2005 | location = Appleton, WI, USA | page = 240 | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 0-615-13013-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thicker fibres are preferred to improve the bulk.

Fluff pulp is normally made rolls ([[reels]]) on a drying machine (a simplified [[Fourdrinier machine]]). The objective of the drying / sheeting operation is to produce a uniform sheet ([[paper density]], moisture and strength) to the converting operation. The pulp may be impregnated with debonders before drying to ease defibration.

The worldwide production of fluff pulps amounts to about 3.5 million tons.

==Applications==
Fluff pulps are used as raw material in the absorbent core of [[personal care]] products such as [[diaper]]s, [[feminine hygiene]] products, air-laid absorbent towelling, as such or with superabsorbents and/or synthetic fibres. More than 80% of the pulps are used in baby diapers.

The most demanding application of fluff pulps is in [[Air-laid paper|air-laid products]], used in serving utensils, various towel applications in homes, in the industry and in hospitals. Fluff pulp for air-laid products are defibrized in a [[hammermill]]. Defibration is the process of freeing the fibres from each other before entering the papermachine. Important parameters for dry defibration are shredding energy and [[Knot (papermaking)|knot]] content.

== Examples ==
Fluid–structure interactions are a crucial consideration in the design of many engineering systems, e.g. aircraft, spacecraft, engines and bridges. Failing to consider the effects of oscillatory interactions can be catastrophic, especially in structures comprising materials susceptible to [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]]. [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)]], the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, is probably one of the most infamous examples of large-scale failure. Aircraft wings and turbine blades can break due to FSI oscillations. Fluid–structure interaction has to be taken into account for the analysis of [[aneurysm]]s in large arteries and [[artificial heart valve]]s. A [[Reed (instrument)|reed]] actually produces sound because the system of equations governing its dynamics has oscillatory solutions. The dynamic of [[reed valve]]s used in two strokes engines and compressors is governed by FSI. The act of "[[blowing a raspberry]]" is another such example. Fluid–structure interactions also occur in moving containers, where liquid oscillations due to the container motion impose substantial magnitudes of [[force]]s and [[Moment (physics)|moment]]s to the container structure that affect the stability of the container transport system in a highly adverse manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolaei|first=Amir|last2=Rakheja|first2=Subhash|last3=Richard|first3=Marc J.|date=2016-01-25|title=An efficient methodology for simulating roll dynamics of a tank vehicle coupled with transient fluid slosh|url=http://jvc.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/01/23/1077546315627565|journal=Journal of Vibration and Control|volume=23|issue=19|language=en|pages=3216-3232|doi=10.1177/1077546315627565|issn=1077-5463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolaei|first=Amir|last2=Rakheja|first2=Subhash|last3=Richard|first3=Marc J.|date=2015-09-01|title=Three-dimensional dynamic liquid slosh in partially-filled horizontal tanks subject to simultaneous longitudinal and lateral excitations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0997754615000746|journal=European Journal of Mechanics B|volume=53|pages=251–263|doi=10.1016/j.euromechflu.2015.06.001|bibcode=2015EJMF...53..251K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolaei|first=Amir|last2=Rakheja|first2=Subhash|last3=Richard|first3=Marc J.|date=2014-01-06|title=Range of applicability of the linear fluid slosh theory for predicting transient lateral slosh and roll stability of tank vehicles|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022460X13007360|journal=Journal of Sound and Vibration|volume=333|issue=1|pages=263–282|doi=10.1016/j.jsv.2013.09.002|bibcode=2014JSV...333..263K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolaei|first=Amir|last2=Rakheja|first2=Subhash|last3=Richard|first3=Marc J.|date=2014-07-01|title=Effects of tank cross-section on dynamic fluid slosh loads and roll stability of a partly-filled tank truck|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0997754614000107|journal=European Journal of Mechanics B|volume=46|pages=46–58|doi=10.1016/j.euromechflu.2014.01.008|bibcode=2014EJMF...46...46K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent example is the start up of a rocket engine, e.g. [[Space Shuttle main engine|Space Shuttle main engine (SSME)]], where FSI can lead to considerable unsteady side loads on the nozzle structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manuel|first=Frey,|date=2001|title=Behandlung von Strömungsproblemen in Raketendüsen bei Überexpansion|url=http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/3667|language=de|doi=10.18419/opus-3650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
Fluid–structure interaction problems and [[multiphysics]] problems in general are often too complex to solve analytically and so they have to be analyzed by means of experiments or [[numerical simulation]]. Research in the fields of [[computational fluid dynamics]] and computational [[structural dynamics]] is still ongoing but the maturity of these fields enables numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Sigrist (2015). ''Fluid-Structure Interaction: An Introduction to Finite Element Coupling''. Wiley ({{ISBN|978-1-119-95227-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Two main approaches exist for the simulation of fluid–structure interaction problems:
*Monolithic approach: the equations governing the flow and the displacement of the structure are solved simultaneously, with a single solver
*Partitioned approach: the equations governing the flow and the displacement of the structure are solved separately, with two distinct solvers
The monolithic approach requires a code developed for this particular combination of physical problems whereas the partitioned approach preserves software modularity because an existing flow solver and structural solver are coupled. Moreover, the partitioned approach facilitates solution of the flow equations and the structural equations with different, possibly more efficient techniques which have been developed specifically for either flow equations or structural equations. On the other hand, development of stable and accurate coupling algorithm is required in partitioned simulations. In conclusion, the partitioned approach allows reusing existing software which is an attractive advantage. However, stability of the coupling method needs to be taken into consideration.

In addition, the treatment of meshes introduces another classification of FSI analysis. The two classifications are the conforming mesh methods and the non-conforming mesh methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.global-sci.com/openaccess/v12_337.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Numerical simulation ==
The [[Newton's method|Newton–Raphson method]] or a different [[fixed-point iteration]] can be used to solve FSI problems. Methods based on Newton–Raphson iteration are used in both the monolithic

These methods solve the nonlinear flow equations and the structural equations in the entire fluid and solid domain with the Newton–Raphson method. The [[system of linear equations]] within the Newton–Raphson iteration can be solved without knowledge of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] with a matrix-free [[iterative method]], using a [[finite difference]] approximation of the Jacobian-vector product.

Whereas Newton–Raphson methods solve the flow and structural problem for the state in the entire fluid and solid domain, it is also possible to reformulate an FSI problem as a system with only the degrees of freedom in the interface’s position as unknowns. This domain decomposition condenses the error of the FSI problem into a subspace related to the interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.cma.2005.01.018 |author1=C. Michler |author2=E. van Brummelen |author3=R. de Borst | title=Error-amplification analysis of subiteration-preconditioned GMRES for fluid-structure interaction | journal=Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering | volume=195 |issue=17–18 | year=2006 | pages=2124–2148|bibcode = 2006CMAME.195.2124M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSI problem can hence be written as either a root finding problem or a fixed point problem, with the interface’s position as unknowns.

Interface Newton–Raphson methods solve this root-finding problem with Newton–Raphson iterations, e.g. with an approximation of the Jacobian from a linear reduced-physics model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1051/m2an:2003049 |author1=J.-F.

This technique is based on the interface block quasi-Newton technique with an approximation for the Jacobians from least-squares models which reformulates the FSI problem as a system of equations with both the interface’s position and the stress distribution on the interface as unknowns. This system is solved with block quasi-Newton iterations of the Gauss–Seidel type and the Jacobians of the flow solver and structural solver are approximated by means of least-squares models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.compstruc.2006.11.006 |author1=J.

Verdonck | title=Implicit coupling of partitioned fluid-structure interaction problems with reduced order models | journal=Computers and Structures | volume=85 | issue=11–14 | year=2007 | pages=970–976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fixed-point problem can be solved with fixed-point iterations, also called (block) Gauss–Seidel iterations,&lt;ref name="H. Matthies, R. Niekamp, J. Steindorf 2006 2028–2049"/&gt; which means that the flow problem and structural problem are solved successively until the change is smaller than the convergence criterion. However, the iterations converge slowly if at all, especially when the interaction between the fluid and the structure is strong due to a high fluid/structure density ratio or the incompressibility of the fluid.&lt;ref name="Causin2005"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.cma.2004.12.005 |author1=P. Causin |author2=J.-F. Gerbeau |author3=F. Nobile | title=Added-mass effect in the design of partitioned algorithms for fluid-structure problems | journal=Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering | volume=194 | issue=42–44 | year=2005 | pages=4506–4527|bibcode = 2005CMAME.194.4506C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convergence of the fixed point iterations can be stabilized and accelerated by Aitken relaxation and steepest descent relaxation, which adapt the relaxation factor in each iteration based on the previous iterations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=U. Küttler |author2=W. Wall | title=Fixed-point fluid-structure interaction solvers with dynamic relaxation | journal=Computational Mechanics | volume=43 | issue=1 | year=2008 | pages=61–72 | doi=10.1007/s00466-008-0255-5|bibcode = 2008CompM..43...61K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the interaction between the fluid and the structure is weak, only one fixed-point iteration is required within each time step. These so-called staggered or loosely coupled methods do not enforce the equilibrium on the fluid–structure interface within a time step but they are suitable for the simulation of [[aeroelasticity]] with a heavy and rather stiff structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5445">'''Gelation (gel transition)''' is the formation of a [[gel]] from a system with branched polymers. [[Branched polymer]]s can form links between the chains, which lead to progressively larger polymers. As the linking continues, larger branched polymers are obtained and at a certain extent of the reaction links between the polymer result in the formation of a single macroscopic molecule. At that point in the reaction, which is defined as [[gel point]], the system loses fluidity and viscosity becomes very large. The onset of gelation, or gel point, is accompanied by a sudden increase in viscosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/047147875X|title=Principles of Polymerization, Fourth Edition - Odian - Wiley Online Library|last=Odian|first=George|language=en|doi=10.1002/047147875x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "infinite" sized polymer is called the gel or network, which does not dissolve in the solvent, but can swell in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/812688409|title=Introduction to polymer science and chemistry : a problem-solving approach|last=1940-|first=Chanda, Manas,|isbn=9781466553842|edition=Second|location=Boca Raton|oclc=812688409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Gelation can occur either by physical linking or by chemical [[Cross-link|crosslink]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ing. While the physical gels involve physical bonds, chemical gelation involves covalent bonds. The first quantitative theories of chemical gelation were formulated in the 1940s by Flory and Stockmayer. Critical percolation theory was successfully applied to gelation in 1970s. A number of growth models (diffusion limited aggregation, cluster-cluster aggregation, kinetic gelation) were developed in the 1980s to describe the kinetic aspects of aggregation and gelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50339757|title=Polymer physics|last=20-|first=Rubinstein, Michael, 1956 December|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Colby, Ralph H.|isbn=019852059X|location=Oxford|oclc=50339757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quantitative approaches to determine gelation ==
It is important to be able to predict the onset of gelation, since it is an irreversible process that dramatically changes the properties of the system.

Two common analytical methods to determine the changes are listed.

=== Average Functionality Approach ===

According to the [[Carothers equation]] number-average degree of polymerization &lt;math&gt;DP_n&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;DP_n= \frac{2}{2-p.f_{av}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the extent of the reaction and  &lt;math&gt;f_{av}&lt;/math&gt; is the average functionality of reaction mixture. For the gel &lt;math&gt;DP_n&lt;/math&gt; can be considered to be infinite, thus the critical extent of the reaction at the gel point is found as

&lt;math&gt;p_c=\frac {2}{f_{av}}&lt;/math&gt;

If  &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is greater or equal to  &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt;, gelation occurs.

=== Flory Stockmayer (statistical) Approach ===

Flory and Stockmayer used a statistical approach to derive an expression to predict the gel point by calculating when &lt;math&gt;DP_n&lt;/math&gt; approaches infinite size. The statistical approach assumes that (1) the reactivity of the functional groups of the same type is the same and independent of the molecular size and (2) there are no intramolecular reactions between the functional groups on the same molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stockmayer|first=Walter H.|date=1943-02-01|title=Theory of Molecular Size Distribution and Gel Formation in Branched‐Chain Polymers|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1723803|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=11|issue=2|pages=45–55|doi=10.1063/1.1723803|issn=0021-9606|bibcode=1943JChPh..11...45S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flory|first=Paul J.|date=1941-11-01|title=Molecular Size Distribution in Three Dimensional Polymers.

Consider the polymerization of bifunctional molecules &lt;math&gt;A-A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B-B&lt;/math&gt; and multifunctional &lt;math&gt;A_f&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the functionality.  The extends of the functional groups are  &lt;math&gt;p_A&lt;/math&gt;and  &lt;math&gt;p_B&lt;/math&gt;,respectively. The ratio of all A groups, both reacted and unreacted, that are part of branched units, to the total number of A groups in the mixture is defined as &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; .This will lead to the following reaction

&lt;math&gt;A-A + B-B + A_f \rightarrow A_{f-1}-(B-BA-A)_nB-BA-A_{f-1}&lt;/math&gt;

The probability of obtaining the product of the reaction above is given by &lt;math&gt;p_A[p_B(1-\rho)p_A]^np_B\rho&lt;/math&gt;, since the probability that a B group reach with a branched unit is &lt;math&gt;p_B\rho&lt;/math&gt; and the probability that a B group react with non-branched A is &lt;math&gt;p_B(1-\rho)
&lt;/math&gt;.

This relation yields to an expression for the extent of reaction of A functional groups at the gel point

&lt;math&gt;p_c= \frac {1}{\{r[1+\rho(f-2)]\}^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where r is the ratio of all A groups to all B groups. If more than one type of multifunctional branch unit is present and average &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; value is used for all monomer molecules with functionality greater than 2.

Note that the relation does not apply for reaction systems containing monofunctional reactants and/or both A and B type of branch units.

{{distinguish|Transformation geometry}}

A '''geometric transformation''' is any [[bijection]] of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] having some geometric structure to itself or another such set. Specifically, "A geometric transformation is a function whose domain and range are sets of points. Most often the domain and range of a geometric transformation are both R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or both R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Often geometric transformations are required to be 1-1 functions, so that they have inverses." &lt;ref&gt;Zalman Usiskin, Anthony L. Peressini, [[Elena Marchisotto]] – ''Mathematics for High School Teachers: An Advanced Perspective'', page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of [[geometry]] may be approached via the study of these transformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Gerard A.|last=Venema|title=Foundations of Geometry|year=2006|publisher=[[Pearson Prentice Hall]]|isbn=9780131437005|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometric transformations can be classified by the dimension of their operand sets (thus distinguishing between planar transformations and those of space, for example). They can also be classified according to the properties they preserve:
* [[displacement (vector)|displacement]]s preserve [[distance]]s and [[angle|oriented angles]];
* [[Isometry|isometries]] preserve angles and distances;&lt;ref name=Berger&gt;{{google books |id=pN0iAVavPR8C|

page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Similarity (geometry)|similarities]] preserve angles and ratios between distances;
* [[affine transformation]]s preserve [[parallelism (geometry)|parallelism]];&lt;ref name=Berger /&gt;
* [[projective transformation]]s preserve [[collinearity (geometry)|collinearity]];&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;Leland Wilkinson, D. Wills, D. Rope, A. Norton, R. Dubbs – ''{{google books|id=NRyGnjeNKJIC|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these classes contains the previous one.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson /&gt;

*[[Circle inversion]] preserve the set of all lines and circles in the planar case (but may interchange lines and circles), and [[Möbius transformation]]s conserve all planes and spheres in dimension 3.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

* [[Diffeomorphism]]s (bidifferentiable transformations) are the transformations that are affine in the first order; they contain the preceding ones as special cases, and can be further refined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = first fundamental form| format=PDF|author = stevecheng| work = planetmath.org| date = 2013-03-13| accessdate = 2014-10-01| url = http://planetmath.org/sites/default/files/texpdf/37332.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Conformal transformation]]s, preserving angles, are, in the first order, similarities.
* [[Equiareal map|equiareal transformations]], preserve areas in the planar case or volumes in the three dimensional case.&lt;ref&gt;{{google books|id=Y6jDAgAAQBAJ|page=191}} Bruce E. Meserve – Fundamental Concepts of Geometry, page 191.]&lt;/ref&gt; and are, in the first order, affine transformations of [[determinant]] 1.

iSat is being developed by NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]], and it was planned as a secondary payload for launch in mid-2018, but launch has been delayed to allow for the propulsion system development to mature.&lt;ref name='Jehle'/&gt;  The mission is planned to last one year before deorbit.&lt;ref name='Jehle'/&gt; 
 
==Spacecraft==

[[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]] uses electricity, typically from [[Solar panels on spacecraft |solar panels]], to accelerate the propellant and produce [[thrust]]. The technology can be scaled up to be used on small satellites up to  {{convert|450|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Kamhawi 2015"/&gt; iSat will also demonstrate advanced power management and thermal control capabilities developed for spacecraft of its size.

The satellite is a 12U [[CubeSat]] format, with dimensions of about 20 cm × 20 cm × 30 cm. Its solar arrays produce 100 W.&lt;ref name="CubeSat TIM"/&gt;

==Propulsion==
[[File:RF Ion Propellants.jpg|thumb|Busek's BIT-3 ion thruster operating on several propellants]]

The propulsion maturation is a partnership between NASA and the U.S. Air Force. iSat's iodine propulsion system consists of a 200 watt [[Hall thruster]] (BHT-200-I) developed by [[Busek|Busek Co]], a [[cathode]], a tank to store solid iodine, a power processing unit (PPU) and the feed system to supply the iodine. The cathode technology is planned to enable heaterless cathode conditioning, significantly increasing total system efficiency.

A key advantage to using [[iodine]] as a propellant is that it provides a high density times specific impulse,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150016478.pdf Propulsion System Testing for the Iodine Satellite (iSAT) Demonstration Mission]. Kurt A. Polzin, Hani Kamhawi. NASA. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CubeSat TIM"/&gt; it is three times as fuel efficient as the commonly flown [[xenon]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/dancing-cubesats/ Dancing cubesats]. Debra Werner. ''Aerospace America'', July  2017.&lt;/ref&gt; it may be stored in the tank as an unpressurized solid, and it is not a hazardous propellant. 1U with 5 kg of iodine on a 12U vehicle can provide a change of velocity of 4 km/s ΔV, perform a 20,000km altitude change, 30° inclination change from [[low Earth orbit|LEO]], or an 80° inclination change from [[Geostationary orbit|GEO]].&lt;ref name="CubeSat TIM"/&gt; During operations, the tank is heated to vaporize the propellant. The thruster then ionizes the vapor and accelerates it via magnetic and electrostatic fields, resulting in high [[specific impulse]].&lt;ref name="Kamhawi 2015"/&gt; The satellite has full three-axis [[attitude control]] capability by using momentum wheels and magnetic torque rods to rotate.  iSat also counts with a passive thermal control system.

== Mission==

There is an emerging and rapidly growing market for small satellites, although they are significantly limited by primary propulsion. In 2013, NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] competitively selected a project for the maturation of an iodine flight operational feed system.&lt;ref name="Dankanich 2014"/&gt; This demonstration flight will address not just propulsion, but the process to integrate commercial off the shelves components as well as custom designed components,&lt;ref name='Jehle'/&gt; opening affordable options of utilizing iodine propulsion systems for national security and for NASA's [[Discovery Program|Discovery class]] missions.&lt;ref name='Jehle'/&gt; 
 
The iodine thruster will allow iSat to alter its orbital inclination and elevation, opening up a wider range of mission objectives than previously possible with spacecraft of this size, such as transferring from a [[geosynchronous orbit]] to [[geostationary orbit]],&lt;ref name="Kamhawi 2015"/&gt; enter and manage lunar orbits, and be deployed to explore [[near Earth asteroids]], [[Mars]] and [[Venus]].&lt;ref name="CubeSat TIM"/&gt;  As a demonstration, the spacecraft will use its propulsion to lower altitude from its initial orbit of about 600 km to a circular orbit of about 300 km. Then it will perform a plane change maneuver, complete any final operational maneuvers and continue to lower its closest approach to Earth, and de-orbit the spacecraft in less than 90 days following the end of the mission.&lt;ref name="Kamhawi 2015"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5195">'''Lake Tuz Natural Gas Storage''' ({{lang-tr|Tuz Gölü Doğalgaz Deposu}}) is an underground [[natural gas storage]] facility under construction in [[Aksaray Province]], central Turkey. It was developed artificially in a salt formation.

The storage facility is situated near [[Sultanhanı]] town in Aksaray Province {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[LakeTuz]] at a depth of {{convert|1100|to|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It was established by creating salt caverns. The twelve man-made salt caverns with a total volume of {{convert|630000|-|750000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} can hold {{convert|1200000000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} natural gas. Daily delivery from the storage can be up to {{convert|44000000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} when needed.&lt;ref name="ia"/&gt;

The geological structure of the area is suitable for large underground natural gas storage facilities. The salt formation covers an area of {{convert|30|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It is {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and around {{convert|2.0|-|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick. It has a [[salt dome]] structure. To create the caverns in the salt formation, fresh water was brought by pipeline from [[Hirfanlı Dam]] at {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}} distance. Using the process of [[solution mining]], water was injected through a borehole into the salt formation, and the [[saline water]], which is formed after [[salvation|dissolution]] of salt in water, was pumped back to the surface leaving a void in the formation. The salt water was transported to {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} far away Lake Tuz by pipeline.&lt;ref name="ia"/&gt; Gas pressure inside the storage is nearly {{convert|210|bar|kPa|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="hbr"/&gt;

The contract for the project was signed between the Turkish [[BOTAŞ]] and the Chinese Tianchen Engineering Company (TCC) in 2012,&lt;ref name="eud"/&gt;&lt;ref name="d1"/&gt; and the construction started in 2013. For the financing, [[World Bank]] provided a loan in amount US$325 million in 2006. Another loan in amount of  US$400 million was secured in 2014.&lt;ref name="ia"/&gt; The first phase of the storage construction completed in February 2017.&lt;ref name="ia"/&gt; It is expected that storage will be fully in service in 2019. When completed, the facility will be capable of storing 10% of the natural gas consumed. Planned goal for total capacity is set to 20% of the consumed natural gas. The cost of the development was US$700 million.&lt;ref name="ia"/&gt;

The storage ensures supply safety in accordance with hourly, daily and seasonal needs. It eliminates supply-demand disparity. Stored natural gas will be withdrawn in times of extreme cold weather or when the water level in the dams are reduced in drought. It also helps price stability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6218">In [[Euclidean geometry]], '''linear separability''' is a property of a pair of sets of [[point (geometry)|points]]. This is most easily visualized in two dimensions (the [[Euclidean plane]]) by thinking of one set of points as being colored blue and the other set of points as being colored red. These two sets are ''linearly separable'' if there exists at least one [[line (geometry)|line]] in the plane with all of the blue points on one side of the line and all the red points on the other side. This idea immediately generalizes to higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces if line is replaced by [[hyperplane]].

The problem of determining if a pair of sets is linearly separable and finding a separating hyperplane if they are arises in several areas.  In [[statistics]] and [[machine learning]], classifying certain types of data is a problem for which good algorithms exist that are based on this concept.

==Mathematical definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;X_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_{1}&lt;/math&gt; be two sets of points in an ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space. Then &lt;math&gt;X_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_{1}&lt;/math&gt; are ''linearly separable'' if there exist ''n'' + 1 real numbers &lt;math&gt;w_{1}, w_{2},..,w_{n}, k&lt;/math&gt;, such that every point &lt;math&gt;x \in X_{0}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sum^{n}_{i=1} w_{i}x_{i} &gt; k&lt;/math&gt; and every point &lt;math&gt;x \in X_{1}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sum^{n}_{i=1} w_{i}x_{i} &lt; k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th component of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Equivalently, two sets are linearly separable precisely when their respective [[convex hull]]s are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] (colloquially, do not overlap).{{Citation needed|reason=It is unclear that this is equivalent|date=September 2017}}

== Examples ==

Three non-[[collinear]] points in two classes ('+' and '-') are always linearly separable in two dimensions. This is illustrated by the three examples in the following figure (the all '+' case is not shown, but is similar to the all '-' case):

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="10"
| align="center" | [[File:VC1.svg]]
| align="center" | [[File:VC2.svg]]
| align="center" | [[File:VC3.svg]]
|}

However, not all sets of four points, no three collinear, are linearly separable in two dimensions. The following example would need ''two'' straight lines and thus is not linearly separable: 

{| align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
| [[File:VC4.svg]]
|}

Notice that three points which are collinear and of the form "+ ⋅⋅⋅ &amp;mdash; ⋅⋅⋅ +" are also not linearly separable.

== Linear separability of Boolean functions in ''n'' variables ==

A [[Boolean function]] in ''n'' variables can be thought of as an assignment of ''0'' or ''1'' to each vertex of a Boolean [[hypercube]] in ''n'' dimensions. This gives a natural division of the vertices into two sets. The Boolean function is said to be ''linearly separable'' provided these two sets of points are linearly separable.

[[Statistical classification|Classifying data]] is a common task in [[machine learning]].
Suppose some data points, each belonging to one of two sets, are given and we wish to create a model that will decide which set a ''new'' data point will be in. In the case of [[support vector machine]]s, a data point is viewed as a ''p''-dimensional vector (a list of ''p'' numbers), and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a (''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional [[hyperplane]]. This is called a [[linear classifier]]. There are many hyperplanes that might classify (separate) the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two sets. So we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized. If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the ''[[maximum-margin hyperplane]]'' and the linear classifier it defines is known as a ''maximum [[margin classifier]]''.

More formally, given some training data &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, a set of ''n'' points of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D} = \left\{ (\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\mid\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^p,\, y_i \in \{-1,1\}\right\}_{i=1}^n&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is either 1 or −1, indicating the set to which the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_i &lt;/math&gt; belongs. Each &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_i &lt;/math&gt; is a ''p''-dimensional [[real number|real]] vector. We want to find the maximum-margin hyperplane that divides the points having &lt;math&gt;y_i=1&lt;/math&gt; from those having &lt;math&gt;y_i=-1&lt;/math&gt;. Any hyperplane can be written as the set of points &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x} - b=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[dot product]] and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{w}}&lt;/math&gt; the (not necessarily normalized) [[Normal (geometry)|normal vector]] to the hyperplane. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{b}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}&lt;/math&gt; determines the offset of the hyperplane from the origin along the normal vector &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{w}}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the training data are linearly separable, we can select two hyperplanes in such a way that they separate the data and there are no points between them, and then try to maximize their distance.

'''Nubuck''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|nj|uː|b|ʌ|k|}}) is top-grain cattle [[leather]] that has been sanded or buffed on the grain side, or outside, to give a slight nap of short protein fibers, producing a velvet-like surface. It is resistant to wear, and may be white or coloured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwicare.com/US/FAQ/ |title=FAQ |publisher=Kiwicare.com |date=2011-04-08 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nubuck is similar to [[suede]], but is created from the outer side of a hide, giving it more strength and thickness and a fine grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ken@thestrapshop.co.uk |url=http://www.watchworx.co.uk/pages/glossary.html |title=Glossary of leather types and finishes. Military, Vinatage and Classic Watch Straps |publisher=Watchworx.co.uk |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally more expensive than suede, and must be coloured or dyed heavily to cover up the sanding and stamping process.

Nubuck characteristics are similar to [[aniline leather]]. It is soft to the touch, scratches easily, and water drops darken it temporarily (it dries to its original color).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hihut.com/caring-for-leather-upholstery.html Caring For Leather Upholstery] - Wayne Jordan&lt;/ref&gt;

The word nubuck probably comes from ''new'' + ''[[Buckskin (leather)|buck(skin)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster, [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/nubuck nubuck], [[Oxford English Dictionary]] [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/246270 nubuck]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2872">'''Nuclear density''' is the [[density]] of the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an [[atom]], averaging about 2.3&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The descriptive term ''nuclear density'' is also applied to situations where similarly high densities occur, such as within [[neutron stars]].

The nuclear density for a typical nucleus can be approximately calculated from the [[nuclear size|size of the nucleus]], which itself can be approximated based on the number of protons and neutrons in it. The radius of a typical nucleus, in terms of number of [[nucleon]]s, is
&lt;math&gt;R=A^{1/3}R_0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass number]] and &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; is 1.25 [[femtometer|fm]], with typical deviations of up to 0.2&amp;nbsp;fm from this value. The density of the nucleus is thus:
:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{A}{{4\over 3} \pi R^3}&lt;/math&gt;
The density for any typical nucleus, in terms of mass number, is thus constant, not dependent on ''A'' or ''r'', theoretically:

:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{A}{{4\over 3} \pi (A^{1/3}R_0)^3} = \frac{3}{4 \pi (1.25\ \mathrm{fm})^3} = 0.122 \ (\mathrm{fm})^{-3} = 1.22 \cdot 10^{44} \ \mathrm{m}^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;

The experimentally determined value for ''n'' is 0.16&amp;nbsp;fm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.

The mass density is the product of ''n'' by the nuclear mass. The calculated mass density, using a [[nucleon]] mass of 1.67×10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt; kg, is thus:
:&lt;math&gt;(1.67 \cdot 10^{-27} \ \mathrm{kg}) (1.22 \cdot 10^{44} \ \mathrm{m}^{-3}) = 2.04 \cdot 10^{17} \ \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications and extensions ==
The components of an atom and of a nucleus have varying densities. The [[proton]] is not a fundamental particle, being composed of [[quark-gluon matter]]. Its size is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; meters and its density 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The descriptive term ''nuclear density'' is also applied to situations where similarly high densities occur, such as within [[neutron stars]].

Using [[deep inelastic scattering]], it has been estimated that the "size" of an [[electron]], if it is not a point particle, must be less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−17&lt;/sup&gt; meters. This would correspond to a density of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Probing deeper within particles, one finds quarks which appear to be very dense and very hard. There are possibilities for still higher densities when it comes to [[quark matter]], [[gluon matter]], or [[neutrino matter]]. In the immediate future, the highest experimentally measurable densities will likely be limited to [[lepton]]s and [[quark]]s.

The Paraho process was invented by John B. Jones, Jr., later president of the Paraho Development Corporation, and developed by Development Engineering, Inc., in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name=assessment&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Its design was based on a [[Gas Combustion Retort Process|gas combustion retort]] developed by the [[United States Bureau of Mines]] and the earlier [[Nevada–Texas–Utah Retort]].  In the late 1940s, these retorts were tested in the Oil Shale Experiment Station at Anvil Points in [[Rifle, Colorado]].&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;  In 1971, the [[Standard Oil of Ohio]] started to cooperate with Mr. John B. Jones providing financial support for obtaining an oil shale lease at Anvil Points.  In May 1972, the lease was approved.&lt;ref name=paraho1/&gt;  Before leasing a track at Anvil Points, a test of using the Paraho Direct process for [[limestone]] [[calcination]] in [[cement kiln]]s was carried out.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;

The consortium for developing the Anvil Points lease – the Paraho Development Corporation – was formed in 1973.&lt;ref name=qer/&gt;  In addition to the Standard Oil of Ohio, other participants of the consortium were [[ARCO|Atlantic Richfield]], Carter Oil, [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Research]], [[Cliffs Natural Resources|Cleveland-Cliffs Iron]], [[Gulf Oil]], [[TransCanada Corp.|Kerr-McKee]], [[Marathon Oil]], Arthur G.

&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration module was never built.

In 1982, Paraho’s semi-works plant was torn down when the Anvil Points station was decommissioned, but the pilot plant was moved to an adjacent plot of private land.

In 1987, Paraho reorganized as New Paraho and began production of SOMAT asphalt additive used in test strips in 5 States. In 1991, New PARAHO reported successful tests of SOMAT shale oil asphalt additive.

On 28 June 2000, [[Shale Technologies (company)|Shale Technologies]] purchased Paraho Development Corporation and became owner of the proprietary information relating to the Paraho oil shale retorting technologies.&lt;ref name="Regent-Energy-Corporation-Feb-2001-10QSB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2798/107878201000002/filing-main.htm |title=Regent Energy Corporation, Form 10QSB, Filing Date Feb 14, 2001 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  However, compared to the earlier gas combustion retorts the Paraho retort's raw oil shale feeding mechanism, gas distributor, and discharge grate have different designs. In the Paraho Direct process, the crushed and screened raw oil shale is fed into the top of the retort through a rotating distributor. The oil shale descends the retort as a moving bed.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;&lt;ref name=lee&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The oil shale is heated by the rising combustion gases from the lower part of the retort and the [[kerogen]] in the shale decomposes at about {{convert|500|°C|°F|0}} to oil vapour, shale oil gas and [[spent shale]].  Heat for pyrolysis comes from the combustion of [[char]] in the spent shale. The combustion takes place where air is injected at two levels in the middle of the retort below the pyrolysis section raising the temperature of the shale and the gas to {{convert|700|°C|°F|0}} to {{convert|800|°C|°F|0}}.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;  Collecting tubes at the top of the retort carry shale oil mist, evolved gases and combustion gases into the product separation unit, where oil, water and dust are separated from the gases.  For combined removal of liquid droplets and particulates, a wet [[electrostatic precipitator]] is used.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt; Cleaned gases from the precipitator are compressed in a compressor.  Part of the gas from the compressor is recycled to the bottom of the retort to cool the combusted shale (shale ash) and carry the recovered heat back up the retort. Cooled shale ash exits the retort through the discharge grate in the bottom of the retort. After processing, shale ash is disposed of.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt; The liquid oil is separated from produced water and may be further refined into high quality products.  The mixture of evolved gases and combustions gases is available for use as a low quality fuel gas for drying or power generation.

The Paraho Indirect is classified as an externally generated hot gas technology .&lt;ref name=AICHE/&gt;  The Paraho Indirect retort configuration is similar to the Paraho Direct except that a part of the gas from the compressor is heated to between {{convert|600|°C|°F|0}} to {{convert|800|°C|°F|0}} in a separate furnace and injected into the retort instead of air.&lt;ref name=fossilenergy/&gt;  No combustion occurs in the Paraho Indirect retort itself.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt; As a result, the fuel gas from the Paraho Indirect is not diluted with combustion gases and the char remains on the disposed spent shale.

The main advantage of the Paraho process is simplicity in process and design; it has few moving parts and therefore low construction and operating costs compared with more sophisticated technologies. The Paraho retort also consumes no water, which is especially important for oil shale extraction in areas with [[water scarcity]].&lt;ref name=paraho1/&gt;
A disadvantage common to both the Paraho Direct and Paraho Indirect is that neither are able to process oil shale particles smaller than about {{convert|12|mm|in|1}}.  These fines may account for 10 to 30 per cent of the crushed feed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="946">[[Crystal]]line materials (mainly [[metal]]s and [[alloy]]s, but also [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] [[Salt_(chemistry)|salt]]s and other materials) are made up of solid regions of ordered matter (atoms placed in one of a number of ordered formations called [[Bravais lattice]]s).  These regions are known as crystals.  A '''perfect crystal''' is the one that contains no point, linear, or planar imperfections.  There are a wide variety of [[crystallographic defect]]s.

The hypothetical concept of a perfect crystal is important in the basic formulation of the [[third law of thermodynamics]].

In [[crystallography]], the phrase 'perfect crystal' can be used to mean “no line or planar defects”, as it is difficult to measure small quantities of point defects in an otherwise defect-free crystal.

Imperfections are created by various thermodynamic processes.

'''Phosphocholine''' is an intermediate in the synthesis of [[phosphatidylcholine]] in tissues.  Phosphocholine is made in a reaction, catalyzed by [[choline kinase]], that converts [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[choline]] into phosphocholine and [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]].   Phosphocholine is a molecule found, for example, in [[lecithin]].

In [[nematode]]s and human [[placenta]]s, phosphocholine is selectively attached to other proteins as a [[posttranslational modification]] to suppress an immune response by their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lovell TM, Woods RJ, Butlin DJ, etal |title=Identification of a novel mammalian post-translational modification, phosphocholine, on placental secretory polypeptides |journal=J.

It is also one of the binding targets of [[C-reactive protein]]&amp;nbsp;(CRP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Thompson D, Pepys MB, Wood SP |title=The physiological structure of human C-reactive protein and its complex with phosphocholine.|journal=Structure |volume=7|issue=2|pages=169–77|year=1999|pmid=10368284|doi=10.1016/S0969-2126(99)80023-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, when a cell is damaged, CRP binds to phosphocholine, beginning the recognition and phagocytotic immunologic response.

A '''Pittsburgh toilet''', often called a "Pittsburgh potty", is a common fixture in pre-[[World War II]] houses built in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. It consists of an ordinary [[flush toilet]] installed in the basement, with no surrounding walls. Most of these toilets are paired with a crude basement shower apparatus and large sink, which often doubles as a laundry basin. Also, because western Pennsylvania is a steep topographical zone, many basements have their own entryway, allowing homeowners to enter from their yard or garage, cleanse themselves in their basement, and then ascend their basement stairs refreshed.  

== Origin ==
As Pittsburgh was historically an industrial town, toilets such as these were said to be used by steelworkers and miners: grimy from the day's labor, they could use an exterior door to enter the basement directly from outside and use the basement's shower and toilet before heading upstairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Kirkland  | first =Kevin | title =Homes &amp; real estate: For house hunters, old and new homes each have their advantages | newspaper =[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date =May 22, 2004  | url =http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sectionfront/life/homes-real-estate-for-house-hunters-old-and-new-homes-each-have-their-advantages-537760/ | accessdate =November 28, 2012  | quote=transplants [to Pittsburgh] to the area might be pleasantly surprised by a few aspects of Pittsburgh housing stock.

The Plant A Tree Today Foundation (PATT) was organised in November 2005 by Andrew Steel,&lt;ref name=Bazaar&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/esd/newsletters/documents/NewsletterDec2009.pdf "Bazaar of Ideas,"] ''United Nations ESCAP Environmental and Development News,'' vol. 9, no. 4 (December 2009), pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;Angus Young, [http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/PATT-hulldailymail.pdf "Campaign Branches Out,"] ''[[Hull Daily Mail]],'' March 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; who established the organization as a means of combating ongoing deforestation in [[developing country|less-developed nations]] around the world through public education and tree-planting campaigns.&lt;ref name=Lake&gt;Howard Lake, [http://www.fundraising.co.uk/newswire/2007/11/12/midas-attends-plant-tree-today-foundation-2nd-birthday-dinner-bangkok-thailand "Midas Attends The Plant A Tree Today Foundation 2nd Birthday Dinner, Bangkok, Thailand,"] UK Fundraising, 12 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The group is a [[Charitable organization#United Kingdom|registered charitable organisation]] in the [[United Kingdom]] since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1117158&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 |title=Charity overview |website=Apps.charitycommission.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after its launch PATT began to work with UK fundraising consultant [[Midas Partnership|The Midas Partnership]], which assisted in the generation of initial capitalisation of the group.&lt;ref name=Lake /&gt; Fundraising activities were conducted both in the UK and in Thailand, a nation of primary concern to the organisation.&lt;ref name=Lake /&gt;

It is also a registered foundation in Thailand. Steel remains the Managing Director of the foundation, assisted by Charlotte Whalley.

PATT works to raise awareness of global environmental issues, campaign for better environmental practices and take action against deforestation and climate change by planting trees.  It implements tree planting projects and [[carbon offsetting]] with environmentally [[conscious business]]es, provides environmental education to schools in developing countries, and funds [[community development]] projects in rural communities centered on tree planting and [[reforestation]].

Reforestation projects sponsored by PATT attempt to generate broad participation among the affected communities. For example, a 2008 reforestation project in [[Phetchaburi]], Thailand, brought together school children, monks, governmental officers, and local villagers with forestation staff in planting over 2500 trees.&lt;ref name=Hua&gt;[http://www.observergroup.net/ob152back/thismonth.htm "Bangkok Buzz,"] ''Hua Hin Observer,'' Issue 152 (August 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Native tree species were replanted in a forest degraded by [[selective logging]] in an effort to restore animal habitat.&lt;ref name=Hua /&gt; The restored lowland [[deciduous]] [[tropical forest]] was to be used in the future as a tool for future environmental education.&lt;ref name=Hua /&gt;

===Carbon Bank and Village Development Project===

In 2009 the Carbon Bank and Village Development Project sponsored by PATT was awarded a 2009 [[United Nations]]-backed SEED Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seed.uno/awards/all/2009/490-carbon-bank-and-village-development-project.html|title=2009 SEED Award Winner: Carbon Bank and Village Development Project|website=SEED|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SEED Initiative]], founded by the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]], the [[United Nations Development Programme]] and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for the Conservation of Nature]], identifies and supports promising locally oriented enterprises in developing countries which are working to improve livelihoods and manage natural resources sustainably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seed.uno/about/work/seed.html|title=About SEED|website=SEED|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's Carbon Bank and Village Development Project targeted 48 rural villages in Thailand, helping to establish community forests and a [[micro-finance]] system in each, managed by the local communities themselves.&lt;ref name=Bazaar /&gt; Ultimately it is hoped that degraded land in these communities will be reforested and climate change lessened through the project, while at the same time village economies are enhanced.&lt;ref name=Bazaar /&gt;

===UK Educational Programme===
In 2012, PATT launched a programme to join with almost 600 primary schools in the UK to provide educational materials, including online lesson plans and activities to be downloaded by teachers and used in classes.  The educational materials are linked with the national curriculum, allowing the future generation to become aware of climate change and the problems which come with global warming.

The programme includes an intranet site for students and teachers to communicate and view lesson plans, as well as being able to interact with others in the programme.  Facts are supported by resources, such as live webcam and video sessions from the wildlife from the middle of the forests, showing the reforestation projects being carried out by PATT.  Maps are also available to pin point on-going and future projects.

{{Actinidesvsfissionproducts}}
'''Plutonium-244''' ('''&lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu''') is an [[isotope]] of [[plutonium]] that has a [[half-life]] of 80 million years. This is longer than any of the other [[isotopes of plutonium]] and longer than any other [[actinide]] isotope except for the three naturally abundant ones: [[uranium-235]] (704 million years), [[uranium-238]] (4.468 billion years), and [[thorium-232]] (14.05 billion years). 

Accurate measurements, beginning in the early 1970s, have detected [[Primordial nuclide|primordial]] plutonium-244,&lt;ref name="PU244"&gt;D. C. Hoffman, F. O. Lawrence, J. L. Mewherter, F. M. Rourke: "Detection of Plutonium-244 in Nature", in: ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' '''1971''', ''234'', 132–134; {{DOI|10.1038/234132a0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; making it the shortest-lived primordial nuclide. The amount of &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu in the pre-Solar nebula (4.57×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years ago) was estimated as 0.008 of amount of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U.&lt;ref name="PRC"/&gt; As the [[age of the Earth]] is about 57 half-lives of &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, the amount of plutonium-244 left should be very small; Hoffman ''et al.'' estimated its content in the rare-earth mineral [[bastnasite]] as {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;244&lt;/sub&gt;}}=1.0×10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; g/g, which corresponded to the content in the [[Earth crust]] as low as 3×10&lt;sup&gt;−25&lt;/sup&gt; g/g&lt;ref name="PU244"/&gt; (i.e. the total mass of plutonium-244 in the Earth crust is about 9&amp;nbsp;g). Since plutonium-244 cannot be easily produced by natural [[neutron capture]] in the low neutron activity environment of [[uranium ore]]s (see below), its presence cannot plausibly be explained by any other means than creation by [[r-process]] [[stellar nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis in supernovas]]. Plutonium-244 thus should be the second shortest-lived and the heaviest [[primordial isotope]] yet detected or theoretically predicted.

However, the detection of primordial &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu in 1971 is not confirmed by recent, more sensitive measurements&lt;ref name="PRC"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lachner|first=J.|last2=et al.|date=2012|title=Attempt to detect primordial &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu on Earth|journal=Physical Review C|volume=85|pages=015801| doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.85.015801}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the method of [[accelerator mass spectrometry]]. In this study, no traces of plutonium-244 in the samples of [[bastnasite]] (taken from the same mine as in the early study) were observed, so only an upper limit on the &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu content was obtained: {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;244&lt;/sub&gt;}} &lt; 0.15×10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; g/g, which is 370 (or less) atoms per gram of the sample, at least 7&amp;nbsp;times lower than the abundance measured by Hoffman ''et al.''

Live interstellar plutonium-244 has been detected in meteorite dust in marine sediments, although the levels detected are much lower than would be expected from current modelling of the in-fall from the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref name="WallnerFaestermann2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wallner|first1=A.|last2=Faestermann|first2=T.|last3=Feige|first3=J.|last4=Feldstein|first4=C.|last5=Knie|first5=K.|last6=Korschinek|first6=G.|last7=Kutschera|first7=W.|last8=Ofan|first8=A.|last9=Paul|first9=M.|last10=Quinto|first10=F.|last11=Rugel|first11=G.|last12=Steier|first12=P.|title=Abundance of live 244Pu in deep-sea reservoirs on Earth points to rarity of actinide nucleosynthesis|journal=Nature Communications|volume=6|year=2015|pages=5956|issn=2041-1723|doi=10.1038/ncomms6956|arxiv=1509.08054|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E5956W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[plutonium-238]], [[plutonium-239]], [[plutonium-240]], [[plutonium-241]], and [[plutonium-242]], plutonium-244 is not produced in quantity by the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], because further [[neutron capture]] on plutonium-242 produces plutonium-243 which has a short halflife (5&amp;nbsp;hours) and quickly [[beta decay]]s to [[americium-243]] before having much opportunity to further capture neutrons in any but very high neutron flux environments. However, a [[nuclear weapon]] explosion can produce some plutonium-244 by [[R-process|rapid successive neutron capture]].

'''Polyester''' is a category of [[polymer]]s that contain the [[ester]] [[functional group]] in their main chain. As a specific [[material]], it most commonly refers to a type called [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET). Polyesters include naturally occurring chemicals, such as in the [[cutin]] of [[plant cuticle]]s, as well as synthetics such as [[polybutyrate]]. Natural polyesters and a few synthetic ones are [[biodegradable]], but most synthetic polyesters are not. The material is used extensively in clothing.

Depending on the chemical structure, polyester can be a [[thermoplastic]] or [[thermoset]]. There are also [[polyester resin]]s cured by hardeners; however, the most common polyesters are thermoplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Rosato|first = Dominick V.|last2 = Rosato|first2 = Donald V.|title = Plastic product material and process selection handbook|publisher = Elsevier|page= 85|year = 2004|url = https://books.google.com/?id=Lqk5QgGoWFkC|isbn = 978-1-85617-431-2|last3 = Rosato|first3 = Matthew V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of thermoset polyesters include the Desmophen brand from Bayer. The OH group is reacted with an [[Isocyanate]] functional compound in a 2 component system producing coatings which may optionally be pigmented. 

[[Fabrics]] woven or knitted from polyester thread or yarn are used extensively in apparel and home furnishings, from shirts and pants to jackets and hats, bed sheets, blankets, upholstered furniture and computer mouse mats. Industrial polyester fibers, yarns and ropes are used in car tire reinforcements, fabrics for conveyor belts, safety belts, coated fabrics and plastic reinforcements with high-energy absorption. Polyester fiber is used as cushioning and insulating material in pillows, comforters and upholstery padding. Polyester fabrics are highly stain-resistant—in fact, the only class of dyes which ''can'' be used to alter the color of polyester fabric are what are known as [[disperse dye]]s.&lt;ref name="Aatcc"&gt;{{cite book|author=Schuler, Mattias J. |title=Dyeing Primer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FPz0QRwKHsMC&amp;pg=PA21|year=1981|publisher=AATCC|page=21|chapter=Part 8: Dyeing with disperse dyes|id=GGKEY:SK3T00EYAFR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyester fibers are sometimes spun together with natural fibers to produce a cloth with blended properties. [[Cotton]]-polyester blends (polycotton) can be strong, wrinkle and tear-resistant, and reduce shrinking. [[Synthetic fiber]]s using polyester have high water, wind and environmental resistance compared to plant-derived fibers. They are less [[Fireproofing|fire resistant]] and can melt when ignited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xfB99Kf38MwC|publisher = Simon and Schuster|date = 17 May 2005|isbn = 9780743272865|first = Cheryl|last = Mendelson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyester blends have been renamed so as to suggest their similarity or even superiority to natural fibers (for example, China silk, which is a term in the textiles industry for a 100% polyester fiber woven to resemble the sheen and durability of insect-derived [[silk]]).

Polyesters are also used to make bottles, films, [[tarpaulin]], canoes, [[liquid crystal display]]s, [[hologram]]s, [[filter (chemistry)|filter]]s, [[dielectric]] film for [[capacitor]]s, [[Electrical insulation|film insulation]] for [[wire]] and [[insulating tape]]s. Polyesters are widely used as a finish on high-quality wood products such as [[guitar]]s, [[piano]]s and vehicle/yacht interiors. [[Thixotropic]] properties of spray-applicable polyesters make them ideal for use on open-grain timbers, as they can quickly fill wood grain, with a high-build film thickness per coat. Cured polyesters can be sanded and polished to a high-gloss, durable finish.

Liquid crystalline polyesters are among the first industrially used [[liquid crystal polymer]]s. They are used for their mechanical properties and heat-resistance. These traits are also important in their application as an abradable seal in jet engines{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; There is no reference or citations here to prove this claim|date=March 2012}}.

Natural polyesters could have played a significant role in the [[origins of life]]. Long heterogeneous polyester chains are known to easily form in a one-pot reaction without catalyst under simple prebiotic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chandru |first1=Kuhan |last2=Guttenberg |first2=Nicholas |last3=Giri |first3=Chaitanya |last4=Hongo |first4=Yayoi |last5=Butch |first5=Christopher |last6=Mamajanov |first6=Irena |last7=Cleaves |first7=H. James |title=Simple prebiotic synthesis of high diversity dynamic combinatorial polyester libraries |journal=Communications Chemistry |date=31 May 2018 |volume=1 |issue=1 |doi=10.1038/s42004-018-0031-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Polyesters as thermoplastics may change shape after the application of heat. While combustible at high temperatures, polyesters tend to shrink away from flames and self-extinguish upon ignition. Polyester fibers have high [[Tenacity (textile strength)|tenacity]] and [[young's modulus|E-modulus]] as well as low water absorption and minimal [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinkage]] in comparison with other industrial fibers.

[[Polyester resin|Unsaturated polyesters]] (UPR) are thermosetting [[resin]]s. They are used in the liquid state as [[casting]] materials, in [[sheet molding compound]]s, as [[fiberglass]] laminating resins and in non-metallic auto-body fillers. They are also used as the [[thermoset polymer matrix]] in [[pre-preg]]s. Fiberglass-reinforced unsaturated polyesters find wide application in bodies of yachts and as body parts of cars.

According to the composition of their main chain, polyesters can be:

Increasing the aromatic parts of polyesters increases their [[glass transition temperature]], melting temperature, [[thermostability|thermal stability]], chemical stability...

Polyesters can also be [[telechelic]] [[oligomer]]s like the polycaprolactone diol (PCL) and the polyethylene adipate diol (PEA). They are then used as [[prepolymer]]s.

==Industry==

===Basics===
Polyester is a synthetic polymer made of [[purified terephthalic acid]] (PTA) or its dimethyl ester [[dimethyl terephthalate]] (DMT) and [[monoethylene glycol]] (MEG). With 18% market share of all plastic materials produced, it ranges third after [[polyethylene]] (33.5%){{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; There is no reference or •	 here to prove this claim|date=March 2012}} and [[polypropylene]] (19.5%).

The main raw materials are described as follows:

;Purified terephthalic acid (PTA) CAS-No.{{colon}} 100-21-0: Synonym: 1,4 benzenedicarboxylic acid, &lt;br/&gt;Sum formula: C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(COOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, mol. weight: 166.13
;Dimethylterephthalate (DMT) CAS-No.{{colon}} 120-61-6: Synonym: 1,4 benzenedicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester, &lt;br/&gt;Sum formula: C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(COOCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, mol. weight: 194.19
;Mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) CAS No.{{colon}} 107-21-1: Synonym: 1,2 ethanediol, &lt;br/&gt;Sum formula: C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , mol. weight: 62.07

To make a polymer of high [[molecular weight]] a catalyst is needed. The most common catalyst is [[antimony trioxide]] (or antimony tri-acetate):

;Antimony trioxide (ATO) CAS-No.{{colon}} 1309-64-4: mol. weight: 291.51, &lt;br/&gt;Sum formula: Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

In 2008, about 10,000 tonnes Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were used to produce around 49 million tonnes polyethylene terephthalate.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; There is no reference or • Cititations here to prove this claim|date=March 2012}}

Polyester is described as follows:

;Polyethylene terephthalate CAS-No.{{colon}} 25038-59-9: Synonyms/abbreviations: polyester, PET, PES, &lt;br/&gt;Sum formula: H-[C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]-n=60–120 OH, mol. unit weight: 192.17

There are several reasons for the importance of polyester:

*The relatively easy accessible raw materials PTA or DMT and MEG
*The very well understood and described simple chemical process of polyester synthesis
*The low toxicity level of all raw materials and side products during polyester production and processing
*The possibility to produce PET in a closed loop at low emissions to the environment
*The outstanding mechanical and chemical properties of polyester
*The recyclability
*The wide variety of intermediate and final products made of polyester.

In the following table, the estimated world polyester production is shown. Main applications are [[textile]] polyester, bottle polyester resin, film polyester mainly for [[packaging]] and specialty polyesters for engineering plastics. According to this table, the world's total polyester production might exceed 50 million tons per annum before the year 2010.

===Raw material producer===
The raw materials PTA, DMT, and MEG are mainly produced by large chemical companies which are sometimes integrated down to the crude oil refinery where [[P-Xylene|''p''-Xylene]] is the base material to produce PTA and [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG) is the base material to produce MEG.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Polyester processing===
After the first stage of polymer production in the melt phase, the product stream divides into two different application areas which are mainly textile applications and packaging applications. In the following table, the main applications of textile and packaging of polyester are listed.

{| class="wikitable"

;A-PET: Amorphous polyester film;
;BO-PET: Biaxial-oriented polyester film;

A comparable small market segment (much less than 1 million tonnes/year) of polyester is used to produce engineering plastics and [[masterbatch]].

In order to produce the polyester melt with a high efficiency, high-output processing steps like staple fiber (50–300 tonnes/day per spinning line) or POY /FDY (up to 600 tonnes/day split into about 10 spinning machines) are meanwhile more and more vertically integrated direct processes. This means the polymer melt is directly converted into the textile fibers or filaments without the common step of [[pelletizing]]. We are talking about full [[horizontal integration|vertical integration]] when polyester is produced at one site starting from crude oil or [[distillation]] products in the chain oil → benzene → PX → PTA → PET melt → fiber/filament or bottle-grade resin. Such integrated processes are meanwhile established in more or less interrupted processes at one production site. Eastman Chemicals were the first to introduce the idea of closing the chain from PX to PET resin with their so-called INTEGREX process. The capacity of such vertically integrated production sites is &gt;1000 tonnes/day and can easily reach 2500 tonnes/day.

Besides the above-mentioned large processing units to produce staple fiber or yarns, there are ten thousands of small and very small processing plants, so that one can estimate that polyester is processed and recycled in more than 10 000 plants around the globe. This is without counting all the companies involved in the supply industry, beginning with engineering and processing machines and ending with special additives, stabilizers and colors. This is a gigantic industry complex and it is still growing by 4–8% per year, depending on the world region.

==Synthesis==
Synthesis of polyesters is generally achieved by a polycondensation reaction. See "[[condensation reaction]]s in polymer chemistry".
The general equation for the reaction of a diol with a diacid is :
:(n+1) R(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + n R´(COOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HO[ROOCR´COO]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;ROH + 2n H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===Azeotrope esterification===
In this classical method, an [[alcohol]] and a [[carboxylic acid]] react to form a carboxylic ester.
To assemble a polymer, the water formed by the reaction must be continually removed by [[azeotrope]] distillation.

===Alcoholic transesterification===
{{main|Transesterification}}

[[File:Transesterification.png|center|thumb|500px|'''Transesterification''': An alcohol-terminated oligomer and an ester-terminated oligomer condense to form an ester linkage, with loss of an alcohol. R and R' are the two oligomer chains, &lt;nowiki&gt;R''&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a sacrificial unit such as a [[methyl group]] ([[methanol]] is the byproduct of the esterification reaction). ]]

===Acylation (HCl method)===
The acid begins as an acid chloride, and thus the polycondensation proceeds with emission of [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) instead of water. This method can be carried out in solution or as an [[vitreous enamel|enamel]].
:'''Silyl method'''
:In this variant of the HCl method, the carboxylic acid chloride is converted with the trimethyl silyl ether of the alcohol component and production of trimethyl silyl chloride is obtained

===Acetate method (esterification)===
:'''Silyl acetate method '''

===Ring-opening polymerization===
[[Aliphatic]] polyesters can be assembled from [[lactone]]s under very mild conditions, catalyzed [[anionic]]ally, [[cationic]]ally or [[metallorganic]]ally.
A number of catalytic methods for the copolymerization of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides have also recently been shown to provide a wide array of functionalized polyesters, both saturated and unsaturated.

==Biodegradation==
{{main|Biodegradation}}
The [[futuro]] house was made of fibreglass-reinforced polyester plastic; polyester-polyurethane, and poly(methylmethacrylate) one of them was found to be degrading by [[Cyanobacteria]] and [[Archaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1= Cappitelli F|author2=  Principi P|author3= Sorlini C.|title= Biodeterioration of modern materials in contemporary collections: can biotechnology help?|date=Aug 2006|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|volume= 24|issue= 8|pages= 350–4|pmid= 16782219|doi= 10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date= 7 November 2006|pages=1075–1079|title=Saving a fragile legacy.

===Cross-linking===
Unsaturated polyesters are thermosetting resins. They are generally copolymers prepared by polymerizing one or more [[diol]] with saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids ([[maleic acid]], [[fumaric acid]]...) or their [[anhydride]]s. The double bond of unsaturated polyesters reacts with a [[vinyl group|vinyl]] monomer, usually [[styrene]], resulting in a 3-D cross-linked structure. This structure acts as a thermoset. The [[exothermic]] [[cross-link]]ing reaction is initiated through a [[catalyst]], usually an [[organic peroxide]] such as [[methyl ethyl ketone peroxide]] or [[benzoyl peroxide]].

==Environmental concerns==

===Pollution of freshwater and seawater habitats===
A team at Plymouth University in the UK spent 12 months analysing what happened when a number of synthetic materials were washed at different temperatures in domestic washing machines, using different combinations of detergents, to quantify the microfibres shed. They found that an average washing load of 6&amp;nbsp;kg could release an estimated 137,951 fibres from polyester-cotton blend fabric, 496,030 fibres from polyester and 728,789 from acrylic. Those fibers add to the general [[microplastics]] [[plastic pollution|pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Mary Catherine (27 October 2014) [https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/27/toxic-plastic-synthetic-microscopic-oceans-microbeads-microfibers-food-chain Inside the lonely fight against the biggest environmental problem you've never heard of].

'''Pounamu''' refers to several types of hard, durable and highly valued [[nephrite jade]], [[bowenite]], or [[serpentinite]] stone found in southern [[New Zealand]]. Pounamu is the [[Māori language|Māori]] name. These rocks are also generically known as "'''greenstone'''" in  [[New Zealand English]].

There are two systems for classifying pounamu. Geologically, the rock falls into the three categories named above, but Māori classify pounamu by appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Pounamu – An iconic stone | work = Kura Pounamu Treasured stone of Aotearoa New Zealand | publisher = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa | date = | url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/pounamu/segment.aspx?irn=1960 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main classifications are ''kawakawa'', ''kahurangi'', ''īnanga'', and ''tangiwai''. The first three are nephrite jade, while ''tangiwai'' is a form of bowenite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Keane | first = Basil | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Pounamu – jade or greenstone – Pounamu – several names | work = Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand | publisher = Ministry for Culture &amp; Heritage | date = 2 March 2009 | url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/MineralResources/PounamuJadeOrGreenstone/1/en | format = | doi = | accessdate = 21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Īnanga pounamu takes its name from a native freshwater fish (''[[Common galaxias|Galaxias maculatus]]'') and is pearly-white or grey-green in colour and varies from translucent to opaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Inanga pounamu | work = Kura Pounamu Treasured stone of Aotearoa New Zealand | publisher = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa | date = | url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/pounamu/ArtWorks.aspx?pirn=1962 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kahurangi pounamu is highly translucent and has a vivid shade of green. It is named after the clearness of the sky and is the rarest variety of pounamu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Kahurangi pounamu | work = Kura Pounamu Treasured stone of Aotearoa New Zealand | publisher = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa | date = | url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/pounamu/ArtWorks.aspx?pirn=1963 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kawakawa pounamu comes in many shades, often with flecks or inclusions, and is named after the leaves of the native kawakawa tree (''[[Macropiper excelsum]]''). It is the most common variety of pounamu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Kawakawa pounamu | work = Kura Pounamu Treasured stone of Aotearoa New Zealand | publisher = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa | date = | url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/pounamu/ArtWorks.aspx?pirn=1964 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tangiwai pounamu is clear like glass but in a wide range of shades. The name comes from the word for the tears that come from great sorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Tangiwai pounamu | work = Kura Pounamu Treasured stone of Aotearoa New Zealand | publisher = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa | date = | url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/pounamu/ArtWorks.aspx?pirn=1965 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern usage ''pounamu'' almost always refers to nephrite jade. Pounamu is generally found in rivers in specific parts of the [[South Island]] as nondescript boulders and stones. These are difficult to identify as pounamu without cutting them open.

== Significance to Māori ==
[[File:Pounamu objects, Canterbury Museum, 2016-01-27.jpg|thumb|right|A wide range of {{lang|mi|pounamu}} objects]]
{{lang|mi|Pounamu}} plays a very important role in [[Māori culture]]. It is considered a {{lang|mi|[[taonga]]}} (treasure) and therefore protected under the [[Treaty of Waitangi]]. {{lang|mi|Pounamu taonga}} increase in {{lang|mi|mana}} (prestige) as they pass from one generation to another. The most prized {{lang|mi|taonga}} are those with known histories going back many generations. These are believed to have their own {{lang|mi|[[mana]]}} and were often given as gifts to seal important agreements. 

{{lang|mi|Pounamu taonga}} include tools such as {{lang|mi|toki}} ([[adze]]s), {{lang|mi|whao}} ([[chisel]]s), {{lang|mi|whao whakakōka}} (gouges), {{lang|mi|ripi pounamu}} (knives), scrapers, [[awl (disambiguation)|awls]], hammer stones, and drill points. Hunting tools include {{lang|mi|[[hei matau|matau]]}} ([[fishing hook]]s) and lures, spear points, and {{lang|mi|kākā poria}} (leg rings for fastening captive birds); weapons such as {{lang|mi|[[mere (weapon)|mere]]}} (short handled clubs); and ornaments such as pendants ({{lang|mi|[[hei-tiki]]}}, {{lang|mi|[[hei matau]]}} and {{lang|mi|pekapeka}}), ear pendants ({{lang|mi|kuru}} and {{lang|mi|kapeu}}), and cloak pins. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Pounamu taonga |publisher=Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/search.aspx?advanced=colCollectionType%3a%22Taonga+Maori%22+colMaterials%3a%22pounamu%22+colCollectionGroup%3aCH&amp;imagesonly=on |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Keane |first=Basil |title=Pounamu – jade or greenstone – Implements and adornment |work=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture &amp; Heritage |date=2 March 2009 |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/pounamu-jade-or-greenstone/4 |accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Functional {{lang|mi|pounamu}} tools were widely worn for both practical and ornamental reasons, and continued to be worn as purely ornamental pendants ({{lang|mi|hei kakī}}) even after they were no longer used as tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Publication/3154 |title=Porotaka hei matau — a traditional Māori tool? |author=Chris D.

{{lang|mi|Pounamu}} is found only in the [[South Island]] of New Zealand, known in Māori as {{lang|mi|Te Wai Pounamu}} ("The [land of] Greenstone Water") or {{lang|mi|Te Wahi Pounamu}} ("The Place of Greenstone").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/224273/maori-names-for-north-and-south-islands-approved |title=Māori names for North and South Islands approved |website=[[RNZ National]] |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 [[the Crown]] handed back the ownership of all naturally occurring {{lang|mi|pounamu}} to the South Island {{lang|mi|[[iwi]]}} {{lang|mi|[[Ngāi Tahu]]|italic=no}},&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ngaitahu.iwi.nz/Ngai-Tahu-Whanui/Natural-Environment/Environmental-Policy-Planning/Pounamu-Management-Plan.php Pounamu Management Plan]", Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/MineralResources/PounamuJadeOrGreenstone/3/en Ngāi Tahu and pounamu]", Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements#Ngāi Tahu|Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement]].

==Geological formation and location==

Pounamu is found on the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]], [[Fiordland]] and western [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Best |first= Elsdon|date=1912 |title=The Stone Implements of the Maori |url= |location= |publisher=Government Printer |page=410  |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coleman |first= Robert Griffin |date=1966 |title=New Zealand serpentinites and associated metasomatic rocks |url= |location= |publisher=Dept. of Scientific and Industrial Research, N.Z. Geological Survey |page=101  |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
It is typically recovered from rivers and beaches where it has been transported to after being eroded from the mountains. However, pounamu has also been quarried by Māori from the mountains, even above the snow line. The group of rocks where pounamu comes from are called [[ophiolites]]. Ophiolites are slices of the deep ocean crust and part of the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. When these deep mantle rocks ([[serpentinite]]) and crustal rock ([[mafic]] [[igneous rocks]]) are heated up ([[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]) together, pounamu can be formed at their contact.&lt;ref name="AdamsBeck2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=C.J.|last2=Beck|first2=R.J.|last3=Campbell|first3=H.J.|title=Characterisation and origin of New Zealand nephrite jade using its strontium isotopic signature|journal=Lithos|volume=97|issue=3-4|year=2007|pages=307–322|issn=00244937|doi=10.1016/j.lithos.2007.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

Pounamu has been formed in New Zeland in three main locations. The [[Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt]] has been metamorphosed in western Southland and pounamu from this belt is found along the eastern and northern edge of Fiordland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coombs|first1=D.

Jewellery and other decorative items made from gold and pounamu were particularly fashionable in New Zealand in the [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] years in the late 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Pounamu – a special gift | work = Kura Pounamu Treasured stone of Aotearoa New Zealand | publisher = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa | date = | url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/pounamu/ArtWorks.aspx?pirn=1993 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Pounamu items from the history collection | work = Collections Online | publisher = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa | date = | url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/search.aspx?advanced=colCollectionType%3a%22History%22+colMaterials%3a%22pounamu%22+colCollectionGroup%3aCH&amp;imagesonly=on | format = | doi = | accessdate = 21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be popular among New Zealanders and is often presented as gifts to visitors  and to New Zealanders moving overseas. In 2009 David Anthony Saxton and his son Morgan David Saxton were sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment for stealing greenstone, with a helicopter, from the southern West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/271748/Greenstone-thieves-sent-to-prison |title=Greenstone thieves sent to prison |last= |first= |date= |website=www.stuff.co.nz |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Viggo Mortensen]], Aragorn in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', took to wearing a ''[[hei matau]]'' around his neck. [[Michael Hurst]] of the television programme ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|Hercules]]'' was given a large and heavy pounamu pendant necklace which he wore on the programme. During a particularly energetic action scene the pendant bumped his teeth. The producers felt the ornament suited the nature of the programme yet considered it a safety risk, and had it replaced with a latex replica.

In the 2016 animated movie ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'', [[Te Fiti]]'s heart was a pounamu stone.

{{infobox rhodium}}

'''Rhodium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Rh''' and [[atomic number]] 45. It is a rare, silvery-white, hard, [[corrosion|corrosion-resistant]] and chemically [[Chemically inert|inert]] [[transition metal]]. It is a [[noble metal]] and a member of the [[platinum group]]. It has only one naturally occurring [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;103&lt;/sup&gt;Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as the free metal, alloyed with similar metals, and rarely as a chemical compound in minerals such as [[bowieite]] and [[rhodplumsite]]. It is one of the rarest and most valuable [[precious metal]]s.

Rhodium is found in platinum or nickel ores together with the other members of the [[platinum group]] metals. It was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] in 1803 by [[William Hyde Wollaston]] in one such ore, and named for the rose color of one of its chlorine compounds, produced after it reacted with the powerful acid mixture [[aqua regia]].

The element's major use (approximately 80% of world rhodium production) is as one of the [[catalyst]]s in the [[Catalytic converter#Three-way|three-way catalytic converters]] in automobiles. Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals, and because of its rarity, rhodium is usually [[alloy]]ed with [[platinum]] or [[palladium]] and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings. [[Colored gold#White gold|White gold]] is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its appearance while [[sterling silver]] is often rhodium-plated for tarnish resistance.

Rhodium detectors are used in [[nuclear reactor]]s to measure the [[Neutron detection|neutron flux level]].

He then precipitated the platinum as [[ammonium chloroplatinate]] by adding [[ammonium chloride]] ({{chem|NH|4|Cl}}). Most other metals like [[copper]], [[lead]], [[palladium]] and rhodium were precipitated with [[zinc]]. Diluted [[nitric acid]] dissolved all but palladium and rhodium. Of these, palladium dissolved in [[aqua regia]] but rhodium did not,&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=1113}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rhodium was precipitated by the addition of [[sodium chloride]] as {{chem| Na|3|[RhCl|6|]·''n''H|2|O}}. After being washed with ethanol, the rose-red precipitate was reacted with zinc, which [[Displacement reaction|displaced]] the rhodium in the ionic compound and thereby released the rhodium as free metal.&lt;ref name="griffith"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bicentenary of Four Platinum Group Metals: Osmium and iridium – events surrounding their discoveries |author=Griffith, W.

Rhodium is a hard, silvery, durable metal that has a high [[reflectance]]. Rhodium metal does not normally form an [[oxide]], even when heated.&lt;ref name="ASM13B"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last = Cramer|editor-first = Stephen D.|editor2-last = Covino, Jr. |editor2-first=Bernard S.|title = ASM handbook|date = 1990|publisher = ASM International|location = Materials Park, OH|isbn=0-87170-707-1|pages = 393–396|url = https://books.google.com/?id=QV0sWU2qF5oC&amp;pg=PA396}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxygen]] is absorbed from the [[atmosphere]] only at the [[melting point]] of rhodium, but is released on solidification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Emsley|first = John|title = Nature's Building Blocks|edition = (Hardcover, First Edition)|publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]|date = 2001|page = 363|isbn = 0-19-850340-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower [[density]] than [[platinum]]. It is not attacked by most [[acid]]s: it is completely insoluble in [[nitric acid]] and dissolves slightly in [[aqua regia]].

===Chemical properties===
[[Image:Wilkinson's-catalyst-2D.png|thumb|left|upright|Wilkinson's catalyst]]
Rhodium belongs to [[group 9 element|group 9]] of the periodic table, but the configuration of electrons in the outermost shells is atypical for the group. This anomaly is also observed in the neighboring elements, [[niobium]] (41), [[ruthenium]] (44), and [[palladium]] (46).

The common [[oxidation state]] of rhodium is +3, but oxidation states from +0 to +6 are also observed.&lt;ref name="Holl"&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1056–1057|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|author2 = Wiberg, Egon|author3 = Wiberg, Nils}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[ruthenium]] and [[osmium]], rhodium forms no volatile oxygen compounds. The known stable oxides include {{chem|link=Rhodium(III) oxide|Rh|2|O|3}}, {{chem|link=Rhodium(IV) oxide|RhO|2}}, {{chem|RhO|2|·''x''H|2|O}}, {{chem|Na|2|RhO|3}}, {{chem|Sr|3|LiRhO|6}} and {{chem|Sr|3|NaRhO|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = B.

[[Rhodium(III) chloride]], rhodium(IV) fluoride, rhodium(V) fluoride and [[rhodium hexafluoride|rhodium(VI) fluoride]] are examples. The lower oxidation states are stable only in the presence of ligands.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, W. P. ''The Rarer Platinum Metals'', John Wiley and Sons: New
York, 1976, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known rhodium-halogen compound is the [[Wilkinson's catalyst]] chlorotris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium(I). This catalyst is used in the [[hydroformylation]] or [[hydrogenation]] of [[alkene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Preparation and Properties of Tris(triphenylphosphine)halogenorhodium(I) and Some Reactions Thereof Including Catalytic Homogeneous Hydrogenation of Olefins and Acetylenes and Their Derivatives| journal= [[Journal of the Chemical Society A]]|date = 1966|pages = 1711–1732|doi = 10.1039/J19660001711| author1=Osborn, J. A.| author2=Jardine, F. H.| author3=Young, J. F.| author4=Wilkinson, G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of rhodium}}
Naturally occurring rhodium is composed of only one [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;103&lt;/sup&gt;Rh. The most stable [[radioisotope]]s are &lt;sup&gt;101&lt;/sup&gt;Rh with a [[half-life]] of 3.3 years, &lt;sup&gt;102&lt;/sup&gt;Rh with a [[half-life]] of 207 days, &lt;sup&gt;102m&lt;/sup&gt;Rh with a [[half-life]] of 2.9 years, and &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Rh with a half-life of 16.1 days. Twenty other radioisotopes have been characterized with [[atomic weight]]s ranging from 92.926 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;Rh) to 116.925 u (&lt;sup&gt;117&lt;/sup&gt;Rh). Most of these have half-lives shorter than an hour, except &lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;Rh (20.8 hours) and &lt;sup&gt;105&lt;/sup&gt;Rh (35.36 hours). It has numerous [[meta state]]s, the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;102m&lt;/sup&gt;Rh (0.141&amp;nbsp;MeV) with a half-life of about 2.9 years and &lt;sup&gt;101m&lt;/sup&gt;Rh (0.157&amp;nbsp;MeV) with a half-life of 4.34 days (see [[isotopes of rhodium]]).&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Audi| first = G.|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.

In isotopes weighing less than 103 (the stable isotope), the primary [[decay mode]] is [[electron capture]] and the primary [[decay product]] is [[ruthenium]]  In isotopes greater than 103, the primary decay mode is [[beta emission]] and the primary product is [[palladium]].&lt;ref&gt;David R. Lide (ed.), Norman E. Holden in ''CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 85th Edition'' CRC Press. Boca Raton, Florida (2005). Section 11, Table of the Isotopes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Rhodium is one of the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|rarest elements in the Earth's crust]], comprising an estimated 0.0002 [[Parts-per notation|parts per million]] (2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Barbalace, Kenneth, "[http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/periodic/Periodic Table of Elements]". Environmental Chemistry.com; retrieved 2007-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its rarity affects its price and its use in commercial applications.

===Mining and price===
[[File:Rh price.png|thumb|left|upright=1.6|Rh price evolution]]
The industrial extraction of rhodium is complex because the ores are mixed with other metals such as [[palladium]], [[silver]], [[platinum]], and [[gold]] and there are very few rhodium-bearing [[mineral]]s. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the [[Ural Mountains]]; and in North America, including the [[copper]]-[[nickel sulfide]] mining area of the [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.

The main exporter of rhodium is South Africa (approximately 80% in 2010) followed by Russia.&lt;ref name="USGSYB08"/&gt; The annual world production is 30 [[tonne]]s. The price of rhodium is highly variable. In 2007, rhodium cost approximately eight times more than gold, 450 times more than silver, and 27,250 times more than copper by weight. In 2008, the price briefly rose above $10,000 per ounce ($350,000 per kilogram). The economic slowdown of the 3rd quarter of 2008 pushed rhodium prices sharply back below $1,000 per ounce ($35,000 per kilogram); the price rebounded to $2,750 by early 2010 ($97,000 per kilogram) (more than twice the gold price), but in late 2013, the prices were less than $1000.

Political and financial problems{{clarify|reason=which problems, where, when?|date=February 2016}} led to very low oil prices and oversupply, causing most metals to drop in price. The economies of China, India and other emerging countries slowed in 2014 and 2015. In 2014 alone, 23,722,890 motor vehicles were produced in China, excluding motorbikes.{{clarify|reason=not clear whether this random figure represents normal production, increase or decrease|date=February 2016}} This resulted in a rhodium price of 740.00 US-$ per [[Troy ounce]] (31.1 grams) in late November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finanzen.net/rohstoffe/rhodium Rhodium price (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Used nuclear fuels===
{{Main|Synthesis of precious metals}}
Rhodium is a fission product of [[uranium-235]]: each kilogram of fission product contains a significant amount of the lighter platinum group metals. [[Used nuclear fuel]] is therefore a potential source of rhodium, but the extraction is complex and expensive, and the presence of rhodium radioisotopes requires a period of cooling storage for multiple half-lives of the longest-lived isotope (about 10 years). These factors make the source unattractive and no large-scale extraction has been attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1595/147106705X35263|url = http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/pdf/79-90-pmr-apr05.pdf|title = Potential Applications of Fission Platinoids in Industry|date = 2005| last1 = Kolarik|first1 = Zdenek|last2 = Renard|first2 = Edouard V.|journal = Platinum Metals Review|volume = 49|issue = 2|pages = 79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Recovery of Value Fission Platinoids from Spent Nuclear Fuel.

==Applications==
The primary use of this element is in automobiles as a [[catalytic converter]], changing harmful unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide exhaust emissions into less noxious gases. Of 30,000&amp;nbsp;kg of rhodium consumed worldwide in 2012, 81% (24,300&amp;nbsp;kg) went into this application, and 8,060&amp;nbsp;kg was recovered from old converters. About 964&amp;nbsp;kg of rhodium was used in the glass industry, mostly for production of fiberglass and flat-panel glass, and  2,520&amp;nbsp;kg was used in the chemical industry.&lt;ref name="USGSYB08"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/platinum/myb1-2012-plati.pdf|publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2012-07-16|title = Commodity Report: Platinum-Group Metals|first = Patricia J.|last = Loferski|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex of a rhodium ion with [[BINAP]] is a widely used chiral catalyst for [[chiral synthesis]], as in the synthesis of [[menthol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Akutagawa, S. |title=Asymmetric synthesis by metal BINAP catalysts|doi=10.1016/0926-860X(95)00097-6 |journal=Applied Catalysis A: General|volume=128|issue=2 |page=171|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ornamental uses===
Rhodium finds use in [[jewelry]] and for decorations. It is [[electroplated]] on [[white gold]] and platinum to give it a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating [[sterling silver]] to protect against tarnish ([[silver sulfide]], Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0536.1984.tb00056.x|title = Contact sensitivity to nickel in white gold|date = 1984|last = Fischer|first = Torkel|journal = Contact Dermatitis|volume = 10|pages = 23–24|pmid = 6705515|last2 = Fregert|first2 = S.|last3 = Gruvberger|first3 = B.|last4 = Rystedt|first4 = I.|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an [[electroplating|electroplate]].&lt;!--, Text seems to add nothing, left for second opinion: "...where tiny amounts of powder, commonly called rhodium sponge,&amp;nbsp;[clarification needed] are in solution."--&gt;
[[File:Example of Solid Rhodium Ring.jpg|thumb|Rhodium is rarely seen as jewelry in its pure, solid form. This ring was made by the photographer for his own use as a wedding band from solid, unalloyed .999 rhodium.]]
Rhodium has also been used for honors or to signify elite status, when more commonly used metals such as silver, gold or platinum were deemed insufficient. In 1979 the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' gave [[Paul McCartney]] a rhodium-plated disc for being history's all-time best-selling songwriter and recording artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/hit-and-run/hit--run-ring-the-changes-1044166.html| work= [[The Independent]] |accessdate=2009-06-06| title= Hit &amp; Run: Ring the changes |location=London|date=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
Rhodium is used as an alloying agent for hardening and improving the corrosion resistance&lt;ref name="ASM13B"/&gt; of [[platinum]] and [[palladium]]. These alloys are used in furnace windings, bushings for glass fiber production, [[thermocouple]] elements, [[electrode]]s for aircraft [[spark plug]]s, and laboratory crucibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Lide, David R|title= CRC handbook of chemistry and physics 2004–2005: a ready-reference book of chemical and physical data|date=2004|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=0-8493-0485-7 |edition=85th |pages=4–26|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WDll8hA006AC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses include:

* Rhodium neutron detectors are used in [[combustion engineering]] nuclear reactors to measure neutron flux levels – this method requires a digital filter to determine the current neutron flux level, generating three separate signals: immediate, a few seconds delay, and a minute delay, each with its own signal level; all three are combined in the rhodium detector signal. The three [[Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station|Palo Verde]] nuclear reactors each have 305 rhodium neutron detectors, 61 detectors on each of five vertical levels, providing an accurate 3D "picture" of reactivity and allowing fine tuning to consume the nuclear fuel most economically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Being a [[noble metal]], pure rhodium is inert. However, chemical complexes of rhodium can be reactive. [[Median lethal dose]] (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) for rats is 198&amp;nbsp;mg of rhodium chloride ({{chem|RhCl|3}}) per kilogram of body weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/0041-008X(72)90016-6|journal = [[Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology]]|volume = 21| issue = 4|date = 1972|pages = 589–590|title = Studies on the toxicity of rhodium trichloride in rats and rabbits|first = Robert R.|last = Landolt|author2 = Berk Harold W.|author3 = Russell, Henry T.|pmid = 5047055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other noble metals, all of which are too inert to occur as chemical compounds in nature, rhodium has not been found to serve any biological function.

People can be exposed to rhodium in the workplace by inhalation. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has specified the legal limit ([[Permissible exposure limit]]) for rhodium exposure in the workplace at 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday, and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set the [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL), at the same level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3860">The '''Senftleben–Beenakker effect''' is the dependence on a magnetic or electric field of transport properties (such as [[viscosity]] and [[heat conductivity]]) of polyatomic gases. The effect is caused by the [[precession]] of the (magnetic or electric) [[dipole]] of the gas molecules between collisions. The resulting rotation of the molecule averages out the nonspherical part of the collision [[cross section (physics)|cross-section]], if the field is large enough that the precession time is short compared to the time between collisions (this requires a very dilute gas). The change in the collision cross-section, in turn, can be measured as a change in the transport properties.

The magnetic field dependence of the transport properties can also include a transverse component; for example, a heat flow perpendicular to both temperature gradient and magnetic field. This is the molecular analogue of the [[Hall effect]] and [[Righi-Leduc effect]] for electrons. A key difference is that the gas molecules are neutral, unlike the electrons, so the magnetic field exerts no [[Lorentz force]]. An analogous magnetotransverse heat conductivity has been discovered for [[photons]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Geert L. J. A. Rikken|author2=Anja Sparenberg|author3=Bart A. van Tiggelen|title=Photonic magneto-transport|journal=Physica B |volume=246|page=188|year=1998|doi=10.1016/S0921-4526(98)00007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[phonons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cornelius Strohm, Geert L. J. A. Rikken, and Peter Wyder|title=Phenomenological evidence for the phonon Hall effect|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume=95|page=155901|year=2005|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.155901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senftleben–Beenakker effect owes its name to the physicists [[Hermann Senftleben]] (Münster University, Germany) and [[Jan J.M. Beenakker]] ([[:nl:Jan Beenakker|nl]]) (Leiden University, The Netherlands), who discovered it, respectively, for [[paramagnetic]] gases &lt;ref&gt;Hermann Senftleben, ''Einfluss eines Magnetfeldes auf das W&amp;auml;rmeleitvermögen von paramagnetischen Gasen [Effect of a magnetic field on the heat conductivity of  paramagnetic gases]'', Phys. Z. '''31''', 822 (1930).&lt;/ref&gt; (such as NO and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[diamagnetic]] gases &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jan J. M. Beenakker&lt;!-- (1926–1998) --&gt;|author2=Giacinto Scoles|author3=Hein F. P. Knaap|author4=Robert Maarten Jonkman|title=The influence of a magnetic field on the transport properties of diatomic molecules in the gaseous state|journal=Phys. Lett.|volume=2|issue=1|pages=5–6|year=1962|doi=10.1016/0031-9163(62)90091-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO). The change in the transport properties is smaller in a diamagnetic gas, because the magnetic moment is not intrinsic (as it is in a paramagnetic gas), but induced by the rotation of a nonspherical molecule. The importance of the effect is that it provides information on the angular dependence of the intermolecular potential. The theory to extract that information from transport measurements is based on the Waldmann-Snider equation (a quantum mechanical version of the [[Boltzmann equation]] for gases with rotating molecules). The entire field is reviewed in a two-volume monograph.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick R. W. McCourt, Jan J. M. Beenakker, Walter E. Köhler, and Ivan Kuščer, ''Nonequilibrium Phenomena in Polyatomic Gases'' (Oxford University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4969">'''Shell Rotella T''' is a line of heavy duty engine lubrication products produced by [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. The line includes engine oils, gear oils and coolants. The oil carries both the [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) diesel "C" rating as well as the API gasoline engine "S" rating. Ratings differ based on the oil. Rotella oils like T3 15w-40 meets both the API CJ-4 and SM specifications, and may be used in both gasoline and diesel engines. However, it is formulated specifically for vehicles without catalytic converters, containing phosphorus levels beyond the 600-800ppm range.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pqiamerica.com/May%202013/rotella.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Rotella is not recommended for gasoline vehicles with catalytic converters due to the higher risk of damaging these emission controls.&lt;ref&gt;http://i.imgur.com/SwGI23M.png&lt;/ref&gt; Newer formulations of Rotella T6 however are API SM rated as safe for pre-2011 gasoline vehicles.

==Product lineup==
The Rotella product family is categorized by Shell into the following product families:
* [[Motor oil|Engine oils]]
* [[Coolant]]s
* Tractor fluid (a universal transmission, gear, hydraulic, and wet brake fluid)
* [[Gear oil]]

In the engine oil family, there are four basic oil sub-families:
* Multigrade conventional oil—in SAE 10W-30 and 15W-40 [[viscosity]] ranges
* Multigrade [[synthetic oil]]—in SAE 5W-40
* Single grade conventional oil—in SAE 20, 30, 40 and 50
* Synthetic blend oil

Both the multigrade conventional oil (10W-30 and 15W-40) and the synthetic SAE 5W-40 meet the newest API certification of CJ-4/SM.

Shell is marketing their new CJ-4/SM oil as "Triple Protection," meaning it provides enhanced qualities for engine wear, soot control and engine cleanliness. Shell's Rotella website indicates that on-road testing confirms the new Triple Protection technology produces better anti-wear characteristics than their existing CI-4+ rated Rotella oil. This is achieved despite a lower zinc and phosphorus additive level as called for by the API CJ-4 specification. (The 15W-40 Rotella T with Triple Protection oil has approximately 1200 ppm of zinc and 1100 ppm phosphorus at the time of manufacture.)

The Shell Rimula brand is multi-national and comparable in all aspects, including the classification names. (i.e. T-5, T-6, Etc.)

==Competitors==
Rotella competes with similar lubrication products from other oil manufacturers. Some notable competitive products are:
*[http://www.phillips66lubricants.com/brands-products/Single.aspx?pid=175&amp;brand=76+Lubricants ConocoPhillips] 76 Lubricants Guardol ECT w/ Liquid Titanium
*[[Mobil]] Delvac
* [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] Delo
* [[Petro-Canada]] Duron
* [[CITGO]] Citgard
* [[Petrol Ofisi]] Maximus
* Royal Purple
* Valvoline Premium Blue
* Castrol Tection

==Motorcycle usage==
Though marketed as an engine oil for diesel trucks, Rotella oil has found popularity with [[Motorcycling|motorcyclists]] as well. The lack of "friction modifiers" in Rotella means they do not interfere with wet clutch operations. This is called a "shared sump" design, which is unlike automobiles which maintain separate oil reservoirs - one for the engine and one for the transmission. Used oil analysis (UOA) reports on BobIsTheOilGuy.com have shown wear metals levels comparable to oils marketed as motorcycle-specific.

===JASO-MA===

Both Rotella T 15W-40 conventional and, Rotella T6 5W-40 Synthetic both list the JASO MA standard; this information can be found on the bottle adjacent to the SAE/API rating stamp. [[Japanese Automotive Standards Organization|JASO]] is an acronym that stands for "The Japanese Automotive Standards Organization." Note that the 10W-30 conventional oil does '''not''' list JASO-MA.

==Use in turbocharged cars==
Likewise with motorcycles, though marketed as an engine oil for diesel trucks, Rotella T6 5w-40 synthetic oil has also found popularity with drivers and tuners of [[gasoline]] powered vehicles that utilize [[turbocharging]] or other forms of [[forced induction]]. Several owners of high performance model cars have adopted its use due to its high heat tolerance and its resistance to shearing. Rotella T6 is a Non Energy Conserving Oil, and does not meet GF-5 Oil specifications. When Rotella T6 was revised for the API specification(for use in spark ignition engines), its Zinc levels were effectively reduced. Higher(content) Zinc Additives(ZDDP) are required for flat tappet engines and cartridge bearings, which In previous formulations Rotella T6 had desirable levels of Zinc(ZDDP).

'''Silane''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with [[chemical formula]], [[silicon|Si]][[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, making it a [[group 14 hydride]].  It is a colourless, [[Pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]] gas with a sharp, repulsive smell, somewhat similar to that of [[acetic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-f-c.com/specgas_products/silane.htm CFC Startec properties of Silane] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319235330/http://www.c-f-c.com/specgas_products/silane.htm |date=2008-03-19 }}. C-f-c.com. Retrieved on 2013-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Silane is of practical interest as a precursor to elemental silicon.

"[[Silanes]]" refers to many compounds with four substituents on silicon, including an [[organosilicon compound]].  Examples include [[trichlorosilane]] (SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[tetramethylsilane]] (Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[tetraethoxysilane]] (Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Production==

===Commercial-scale routes===
{{see also|Direct process}}
Silane can be produced by several routes.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{ Ullmann | author = Simmler, W. | title = Silicon Compounds, Inorganic | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a24_001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, it arises from the reaction of hydrogen chloride with [[magnesium silicide]]:
:Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si  +  4 HCl  →   2 MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

It is also prepared from metallurgical grade silicon in a two-step process. First, silicon is treated with [[hydrogen chloride]] at about 300&amp;nbsp;°C to produce [[trichlorosilane]], HSiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, along with [[hydrogen]] gas, according to the [[chemical equation]]:
:Si + 3 HCl → HSiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The trichlorosilane is then converted to a mixture of silane and [[silicon tetrachloride]]. This [[redistribution reaction]] requires a catalyst:
:4 HSiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; →  SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

The most commonly used catalysts for this process are [[metal]] [[halogen|halides]], particularly [[aluminium chloride]]. This is referred to as a [[Redistribution (chemistry)|redistribution reaction]], which is a double displacement involving the same central element. It may also be thought of as a [[disproportionation]] reaction even though there is no change in the oxidation number for silicon (Si has a nominal oxidation number IV in all three species). However, the utility of the oxidation number concept for a covalent molecule, even a polar covalent molecule, is ambiguous. The silicon atom could be rationalized as having the highest formal oxidation state and partial positive charge in SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and the lowest formal oxidation state in SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; since Cl is far more electronegative than is H.

An alternative industrial process for the preparation of very high purity silane, suitable for use in the production of semiconductor grade silicon, starts with metallurgical grade silicon, hydrogen, and [[silicon tetrachloride]] and involves a complex series of redistribution reactions (producing byproducts that are recycled in the process) and distillations. The reactions are summarized below:

:Si + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 4 SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
:2 SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → SiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
:2 [[Dichlorosilane|SiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl
:2 [[Chlorosilane|SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]] → SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
 
The silane produced by this route can be thermally decomposed to produce high-purity silicon and hydrogen in a single pass.

Still other industrial routes to silane involve reduction of [[Silicon tetrafluoride|SiF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] with [[sodium hydride]] (NaH) or reduction of SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with [[lithium aluminum hydride]] (LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

Another commercial production of silane involves reduction of [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) under Al and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas in a mixture of [[NaCl]] and [[aluminum chloride]] (AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at high pressures:&lt;ref&gt;Shriver and Atkins. Inorganic Chemistry (5th Edition). W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, 2010, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

:3 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 Al → 3 SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

===Laboratory-scale routes===
In 1857, the German chemists [[Heinrich Buff]] and [[Friedrich Wöhler|Friedrich Woehler]] discovered silane among the products formed by the action of [[hydrochloric acid]] on aluminum silicide, which they had previously prepared. They called the compound ''siliciuretted hydrogen''.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, J. W. "A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry," Vol VI, Longmans, Green and Co. (1947), p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

For classroom demonstrations, silane can be produced by heating [[sand]] with [[magnesium]] powder to produce [[magnesium silicide]] (Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si), then pouring the mixture into hydrochloric acid. The magnesium silicide reacts with the acid to produce silane gas, which [[pyrophoricity|burns]] on contact with air and produces tiny explosions.&lt;ref name="theodoregray"&gt;[http://www.theodoregray.com/PeriodicTable/PopularScience/2005/10/1/index.html Making Silicon from Sand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129090339/http://theodoregray.com/PeriodicTable/PopularScience/2005/10/1/index.html |date=2010-11-29 }}, by Theodore Gray. Originally published in [[Popular Science]] magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be classified as a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]]{{Clarify|date = October 2011}} [[Acid–base reaction|acid-base]] chemical reaction since the isolated Si&lt;sup&gt;4 −&lt;/sup&gt; ion in the Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si [http://wikis.lib.ncsu.edu/index.php/Fluorite/Antifluorite antifluorite] structure can serve as a Brønsted–Lowry base capable of accepting four protons. It can be written as:

:4 HCl + Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si → SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In general, the alkaline-earth metals form silicides with the following [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometries]]: M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si, M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Si, and M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In all cases, these substances react with Brønsted–Lowry acids to produce some type of hydride of silicon that is dependent on the Si anion connectivity in the silicide. The possible products include SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and/or higher molecules in the homologous series Si&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+2&lt;/sub&gt;, a polymeric silicon hydride, or a [[silicic acid]]. Hence, M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Si with their zigzag chains of Si&lt;sup&gt;2 −&lt;/sup&gt; anions (containing two lone pairs of electrons on each Si anion that can accept protons) yield the polymeric hydride (SiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.

Yet another small-scale route for the production of silane is from the action of [[sodium amalgam]] on [[dichlorosilane]], SiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to yield monosilane along with some yellow [[Polysilicon hydride|polymerized silicon hydride]] (SiH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, J. W. "A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry, Vol. VI" Longmans, Green and Co. (1947) pp. 970–971.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Silane is the [[silicon]] [[Analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[methane]]. Because of the greater electronegativity of hydrogen in comparison to silicon, this Si–H bond polarity is the opposite of that in the C–H bonds of methane. One consequence of this reversed polarity is the greater tendency of silane to form complexes with transition metals.  A second consequence is that silane is [[pyrophoric]]&amp;nbsp;— it undergoes spontaneous combustion in air, without the need for external ignition.&lt;ref&gt;{{

Several industrial and medical applications exist for silane and functionalized silanes. For instance, silanes are used as coupling agents to adhere fibers such as [[fiberglass|glass fiber]]s and [[carbon fiber]]s to certain [[polymer]] matrices, stabilizing the [[composite material]]. In other words, [[silanization|silane coats]] the [[fiberglass|glass fiber]]s to create better adhesion to the polymer matrix. They can also be used to couple a bio-inert layer on a [[titanium]] [[prosthesis|implant]]. Other applications include [[water repellent]]s, [[masonry]] protection, control of [[graffiti]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protectosil.com/protectosil/en/otherregions/graffiticontrol/default Graffiti protection systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009132459/http://www.protectosil.com/protectosil/en/otherregions/graffiticontrol/default |date=2007-10-09 }}.

The [[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition|PECVD]] process is relatively inefficient at materials utilization with approximately 85% of the silane being wasted.

If a leaking stream of silane is obstructed or confined, energy release due to combustion is more concentrated leading to increasing reaction speed and burning velocity – up to gas phase detonation and potentially severe damages. Silane may [[autoignition|autoignite]] at under 54&amp;nbsp;°C (130&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voltaix.com/images/doc/Mssi000_Silane.pdf Silane MSDS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519130659/http://www.voltaix.com/images/doc/Mssi000_Silane.pdf |date=2014-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For lean mixtures a two-stage reaction process has been proposed, which consists of a silane consumption process and a hydrogen oxidation process. The heat of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (s) condensation increases the burning velocity due to thermal feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{

In Japan, in order to reduce the danger of silane for amorphous silicon solar cell manufacturing, several companies began to dilute silane with [[hydrogen]] gas. This resulted in a symbiotic benefit of making more stable [[solar photovoltaic]] cells as it reduced the [[Staebler–Wronski effect|Staebler-Wronski Effect]].

Unlike methane, silane is fairly toxic: the lethal concentration in air for rats ([[Median lethal dose|LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is 0.96% (9,600 ppm) over a 4-hour exposure. In addition, contact with eyes may form [[silicic acid]] with resultant irritation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vngas.com/pdf/g97.pdf MSDS for silane] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220021944/http://www.vngas.com/pdf/g97.pdf |date=2009-02-20 }}. vngas.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to occupational exposure of silane to workers, the US [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] of 5 ppm (7&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) over an eight-hour time-weighted average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silicon tetrahydride|work=NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0556.html|date=April 4, 2011|accessdate=November 18, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726044247/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0556.html|archivedate=July 26, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many solar cookers currently in use are relatively inexpensive, [[low-tech]] devices, although some are as powerful or as expensive as traditional stoves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Cookers: Varieties and Styles|url=http://www.solarcooker-at-cantinawest.com/solarcookers-types.html|publisher=CantinaWest|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advanced, large-scale solar cookers can cook for hundreds of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Largest 38500-meal Solar Kitchen in India|url=http://inhabitat.com/world%E2%80%99s-largest-solar-kitchen-in-india-can-cook-upto-38500-meals-per-day/|publisher=inhabitat|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they use no fuel and cost nothing to operate, many nonprofit organizations are promoting their use worldwide in order to help reduce fuel costs (especially where monetary reciprocity is low) and air pollution, and to slow down the [[deforestation]] and [[desertification]] caused by gathering firewood for cooking.

== Principles ==
1) Concentrating sunlight: A mirrored surface with high [[Specular reflection|specular reflectivity]] is used to concentrate light from the sun on to a small cooking area. Depending on the geometry of the surface, sunlight can be [[Concentrated solar power|concentrated]] by several orders of magnitude producing temperatures high enough to melt salt and smelt metal. For most household solar cooking applications, such high temperatures are not really required. Solar cooking products, thus, are typically designed to achieve temperatures of {{convert|65|C|-1}} (baking temperatures) to {{convert|400|C|-1}} (grilling/searing temperatures) on a sunny day.

2) Converting light energy to heat energy: Solar cookers concentrate sunlight onto a receiver such as a cooking pan. The interaction between the light energy and the receiver material converts light to heat. This conversion is maximized by using materials that conduct and retain heat. Pots and pans used on solar cookers should be matte black in color to maximize the absorption.

3) Trapping heat energy: It is important to reduce [[convection]] by isolating the air inside the cooker from the air outside the cooker. Simply using a glass lid on your pot enhances light absorption from the top of the pan and provides a [[greenhouse effect]] that improves heat retention and minimizes [[Heat transfer|convection loss]]. This "glazing" transmits incoming visible sunlight but is opaque to escaping infrared thermal radiation. In resource constrained settings, a high-temperature plastic bag can serve a similar function, trapping air inside and making it possible to reach temperatures on cold and windy days similar to those possible on hot days.

== Operation ==
[[File:Solar oven Portugal 2007.jpg|thumb|Solar oven in use]]

Different kinds of solar cookers use somewhat different methods of cooking, but most follow the same basic principles.

Food is prepared as if for an oven or stove top. However, because food cooks faster when it is in smaller pieces, food placed inside a solar cooker is usually cut into smaller pieces than it might otherwise be.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8117-3402-1" /&gt; For example, potatoes are usually cut into bite-sized pieces rather than roasted whole.&lt;ref name="isbn0-9629069-2-1" /&gt; For very simple cooking, such as melting butter or cheese, a lid may not be needed and the food may be placed on an uncovered [[Sheet pan|tray]] or in a bowl. If several foods are to be cooked separately, then they are placed in different containers.

The container of food is placed inside the solar cooker, which may be elevated on a brick, rock, metal [[trivet]], or other [[heat sink]], and the solar cooker is placed in direct sunlight.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8117-3402-1" /&gt; Foods that cook quickly may be added to the solar cooker later. Rice for a mid-day meal might be started early in the morning, with vegetables, cheese, or soup added to the solar cooker in the middle of the morning. Depending on the size of the solar cooker and the number and quantity of cooked foods, a family may use one or more solar cookers.

A solar oven is turned towards the sun and left until the food is cooked. Unlike cooking on a stove or over a fire, which may require more than an hour of constant supervision, food in a solar oven is generally not stirred or turned over, both because it is unnecessary and because opening the solar oven allows the trapped heat to escape and thereby slows the cooking process. If wanted, the solar oven may be checked every one to two hours, to turn the oven to face the sun more precisely and to ensure that shadows from nearby buildings or plants have not blocked the sunlight. If the food is to be left untended for many hours during the day, then the solar oven is often turned to face the point where the sun will be when it is highest in the sky, instead of towards its current position.&lt;ref name="Halacy" /&gt;

The cooking time depends primarily on the equipment being used, the amount of sunlight at the time, and the quantity of food that needs to be cooked. Air temperature, wind, and latitude also affect performance. Food cooks faster in the two hours before and after the local solar noon than it does in either the early morning or the late afternoon. Large quantities of food, and food in large pieces, take longer to cook. As a result, only general figures can be given for cooking time. With a small solar panel cooker, it might be possible to melt butter in 15 minutes, to bake cookies in 2 hours, and to cook rice for four people in 4 hours. With a high performing parabolic solar cooker, you may be able to grill a steak in minutes. However, depending on local conditions and the solar cooker type, these projects could take half as long, or twice as long.

It is difficult to burn food in a solar cooker.&lt;ref name="isbn0-9629069-2-1" /&gt; Food that has been cooked even an hour longer than necessary is usually indistinguishable from minimally cooked food. The exception to this rule is some green vegetables, which quickly change from a perfectly cooked bright green to [[olive drab]], while still retaining the desirable texture.

For most foods, such as rice, the typical person would be unable to tell how it was cooked from looking at the final product. There are some differences, however: Bread and cakes brown on their tops instead of on the bottom. Compared to cooking over a fire, the food does not have a smoky flavor.

== Box and panel designs ==
[[File:HotPot d.PNG|thumb|left|HotPot panel solar cooker]]
A box cooker has a transparent glass or plastic top, and it may have additional reflectors to concentrate sunlight into the box. The top can usually be removed to allow dark pots containing food to be placed inside. One or more reflectors of shiny metal or foil-lined material may be positioned to bounce extra light into the interior of the oven chamber. Cooking containers and the inside bottom of the cooker should be dark-colored or black. Inside walls should be reflective to reduce radiative heat loss and bounce the light towards the pots and the dark bottom, which is in contact with the pots. The box should have insulated sides. [[Thermal insulation]] for the solar box cooker must be able to withstand temperatures up to 150&amp;nbsp;°C (300&amp;nbsp;°F) without melting or out-gassing. Crumpled newspaper, wool, rags, dry grass, sheets of cardboard, etc. can be used to insulate the walls of the cooker. Metal pots and/or bottom trays can be darkened either with flat-black spray paint (one that is non-toxic when warmed), black [[tempera]] paint, or soot from a fire. The solar box cooker typically reaches a temperature of 150&amp;nbsp;°C (300&amp;nbsp;°F). This is not as hot as a standard oven, but still hot enough to cook food over a somewhat longer period of time.

Panel solar cookers are inexpensive solar cookers that use reflective panels to direct sunlight to a cooking pot that is enclosed in a clear plastic bag.

Solar Oven science experiments are regularly done as projects in high schools and colleges, such as the "Solar Oven Throwdown" at the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/photos/solar-oven-throwdown-heats-ua-mall|title=Solar Oven Throwdown Heats Up UA Mall|website=UANews|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects prove that it is possible to both achieve high temperatures, as well as predict the high temperatures using mathematical models.

== Parabolic reflectors ==
{{Main|parabolic reflector}}
Parabolic solar cookers concentrate sunlight to a single point. When this point is focused on the bottom of a pot, it can heat the pot quickly to very high temperatures which can often be comparable with the temperatures achieved in gas and charcoal grills. These types of solar cookers are widely used in several regions of the world, most notably in China and India where hundreds of thousands of families currently use parabolic solar cookers for preparing food and heating water. Some parabolic solar cooker projects in China abate between 1-4 tons of carbon dioxide per year and receive carbon credits through the [http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/clean_development_mechanism/items/2718.php Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)] and [http://www.goldstandard.org/ Gold Standard].

[[File:Solar tea kettle.JPG|thumb|upleft|Solar tea kettle in Tibet]]
Some parabolic solar cookers incorporate cutting edge materials and designs which lead to solar energy efficiencies &gt;90%. Others are large enough to feed thousands of people each day, such as the solar bowl at Auroville in India, which makes 2 meals per day for 1,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.auroville.org/research/ren_energy/solar_bowl.htm |title=The solar bowl |date=22 December 2014 |work=archive.org |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222040320/http://archive.auroville.org/research/ren_energy/solar_bowl.htm |archivedate=22 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a reflector is axially symmetrical and shaped so its cross-section is a [[parabola]], it has the property of bringing parallel rays of light (such as sunlight) to a point ''[[Focus (optics)|focus]]''. If the axis of symmetry is aimed at the sun, any object that is located at the focus receives highly concentrated sunlight, and therefore becomes very hot. This is the basis for the use of this kind of reflector for solar cooking.

=== Paraboloidal reflectors ===
[[File:ALSOL.jpg|thumb|left|A parabolic solar cooker with segmented construction .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarcookingatlas.com/solar-cooking-pictures.php Solar cooker pictures] Solar Cooking Atlas official website&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Paraboloid]]s are [[wikt:compound curve|compound curves]], which are more difficult to make with simple equipment than [[wikt:single curve|single curves]]. Although paraboloidal solar cookers can cook as well as or better than a conventional stove, they are difficult to construct by hand. Frequently, these reflectors are made using many small segments that are all single curves which together approximate compound curves.

Although paraboloids are difficult to make from flat sheets of solid material, they can be made quite simply by rotating open-topped containers which hold liquids. The top surface of a liquid which is being rotated at constant speed around a vertical axis naturally takes the form of a paraboloid. [[Centrifugal force]] causes material to move outward from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling effect of gravity. It turns out that the depression is an exact paraboloid. (See [[Liquid mirror telescope]].) If the material solidifies while it is rotating, the paraboloidal shape is maintained after the rotation stops, and can be used to make a reflector.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} This rotation technique is sometimes used to make paraboloidal mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and has also been used for solar cookers. Devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as [[rotating furnace]]s.

Paraboloidal reflectors generate high temperatures and cook quickly, but require frequent adjustment and supervision for safe operation. Several hundred thousand exist, mainly in China.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} They are especially useful for individual household and large-scale institutional cooking.

[[File:Parabole de cuisson solaire Scheffler coccion solar cooking.jpg|thumb|upright|A Scheffler cooker. This reflector has an area of {{convert|16|m2|abbr=on}}, and concentrates 3 kW of heat]]

A Scheffler cooker (named after its inventor, [[Wolfgang Scheffler (inventor)|Wolfgang Scheffler]]) uses a large ideally paraboloidal reflector which is rotated around an axis that is parallel with the earth's using a mechanical mechanism, turning at 15 degrees per hour to compensate for the earth's rotation. The axis passes through the reflector's centre of mass, allowing the reflector to be turned easily. The cooking vessel is located at the focus which is on the axis of rotation, so the mirror concentrates sunlight onto it all day. The mirror has to be occasionally tilted about a perpendicular axis to compensate for the seasonal variation in the sun's [[declination]]. This perpendicular axis does not pass through the cooking vessel. Therefore, if the reflector were a rigid paraboloid, its focus would not remain stationary at the cooking vessel as the reflector tilts. To keep the focus stationary, the reflector's shape has to vary. It remains paraboloidal, but its focal length and other parameters change as it tilts. The Scheffler reflector is therefore flexible, and can be bent to adjust its shape. It is often made up of a large number of small plane sections, such as glass mirrors, joined together by flexible plastic. A framework that supports the reflector includes a mechanism that can be used to tilt it and also bend it appropriately. The mirror is never exactly paraboloidal, but it is always close enough for cooking purposes.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Sometimes the rotating reflector is located outdoors and the reflected sunlight passes through an opening in a wall into an indoor kitchen, often a large communal one, where the cooking is done.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

[[File:focus-balanced parabolic reflector.svg|thumb|300px|An [[oblique projection]] of a focus-balanced parabolic reflector]]
Paraboloidal reflectors that have their centres of mass coincident with their focal points are useful. They can be easily turned to follow the sun's motions in the sky, rotating about any axis that passes through the focus. Two perpendicular axes can be used, intersecting at the focus, to allow the paraboloid to follow both the sun's daily motion and its seasonal one. The cooking pot stays stationary at the focus. If the paraboloidal reflector is axially symmetrical and is made of material of uniform thickness, its centre of mass coincides with its focus if the depth of the reflector, measured along its axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane of the rim, is 1.8478 times its focal length. The radius of the rim of the reflector is 2.7187 times the focal length. The angular radius of the rim, as seen from the focal point, is 72.68 degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
{{clear}}

=== Parabolic troughs ===
[[Parabolic trough]]s are used to concentrate sunlight for solar-energy purposes. Some solar cookers have been built that use them in the same way.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Generally, the trough is aligned with its focal line horizontal and east-west. The food to be cooked is arranged along this line. The trough is pointed so its axis of symmetry aims at the sun at noon. This requires the trough to be tilted up and down as the seasons progress. At the equinoxes, no movement of the trough is needed during the day to track the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Solar Tracking (eBook) |author=Prinsloo, GJ |author2=Dobson, RT |last-author-amp=yes |DOI=10.13140/RG.2.1.4265.6329/1 |ISBN=978-0-620-61576-1|pages=1 |date=572}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other times of year, there is a period of several hours around noon each day when no tracking is needed. Usually, the cooker is used only during this period, so no automatic sun tracking is incorporated into it. This simplicity makes the design attractive, compared with using a paraboloid. Also, being a [[wikt:single curve|single curve]], the trough reflector is simpler to construct. However, it suffers from lower efficiency.

It is possible to use two parabolic troughs, curved in perpendicular directions, to bring sunlight to a point focus as does a paraboloidal reflector.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}The incoming light strikes one of the troughs, which sends it toward a line focus. The second trough intercepts the converging light and focuses it to a point.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Compared with a single paraboloid, using two partial troughs has important advantages. Each trough is a [[wikt:single curve|single curve]], which can be made simply by bending a flat sheet of metal. Also, the light that reaches the targeted cooking pot is directed approximately downward, which reduces the danger of damage to the eyes of anyone nearby. On the other hand, there are disadvantages. More mirror material is needed, increasing the cost, and the light is reflected by two surfaces instead of one, which inevitably increases the amount that is lost.

The two troughs are held in a fixed orientation relative to each other by being both fixed to a frame.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The whole assembly of frame and troughs has to be moved to track the sun as it moves in the sky. Commercially made cookers that use this method are available.In practical applications (like in car-headlights), concave mirrors are of parabolic shape

=== Spherical reflectors ===
[[File:Auroville Solar Bowl.JPG|thumb|The Solar Bowl in [[Auroville]]]]

Spherical reflectors operate much like paraboloidal reflectors, such that the axis of symmetry is pointed towards the sun so that light is concentrated to a focus.  However, the focus of a spherical reflector will not be a point focus because it suffers from a phenomenon known as [[spherical aberration]].  Some concentrating dishes (such as satellite dishes) that do not require a precise focus opt for a spherical curvature over a paraboloid. If the radius of the rim of spherical reflector is small compared with the radius of curvature of its surface (the radius of the sphere of which the reflector is a part), the reflector approximates a paraboloidal one with focal length equal to half of the radius of curvature.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Parabola#Focal length and radius of curvature at the vertex]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vacuum tube technology ===

Evacuated tube solar cookers are essentially a vacuum sealed between two layers of glass.  The vacuum allows the tube to act both as a "super" greenhouse and an insulator. The central cooking tube is made from borosilicate glass, which is resistant to thermal shock, and has a vacuum beneath the surface to insulate the interior. The inside of the tube is lined with copper, stainless steel, and aluminum nitrile to better absorb and conduct heat from the sun's rays. Some vacuum tube solar cookers incorporate lightweight designs which allow great portability (such as the GoSun stove)
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fincher|first=Johnathan |title=GoSun:Portable solar oven cooks food in as little as 10 minutes |url=http://www.gizmag.com/gosun-stove-portable-solar-cooker/29072/ |accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Portable vacuum tube cookers such as the GoSun allow users to cook freshly caught fish on the beach without needing to light a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Twmffat|first=Tecwyn |title=Solar cooked mackerel on the rocks|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Cooked-Wild-Mackerel-on-the-Rocks/ |accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

'''Advantages'''
* High-performance parabolic solar cookers and vacuum tube cookers can attain temperatures above 290&amp;nbsp;°C (550&amp;nbsp;°F). They can be used to grill meats, stir-fry vegetables, make soup, bake bread, and boil water in minutes. Vacuum tube type cookers can heat up even in the clouds and freezing cold.
* Conventional solar box cookers attain temperatures up to 165&amp;nbsp;°C (325&amp;nbsp;°F). They can sterilize water or prepare most foods that can be made in a conventional oven or stove, including bread, vegetables and meat over a period of hours.
* Solar cookers use no fuel. This saves cost as well as reducing environmental damage caused by fuel use. Since 2.5 billion people cook on open fires using biomass fuels, solar cookers could have large economic and environmental benefits by reducing deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO: Household Air Pollution and Health|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When solar cookers are used outside, they do not contribute inside heat, potentially saving fuel costs for cooling as well. Any type of cooking may evaporate grease, oil, and other material into the air, hence there may be less cleanup.
*Reduces your carbon footprint by cooking without the use of carbon based fuels or grid electricity from traditional sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thetinylife.com/the-complete-solar-oven-guide-best-solar-oven-reviews/|title=The Complete Solar Oven Guide: 6 Best Solar Oven Reviews {{!}} The Tiny Life|work=The Tiny Life|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''Disadvantages'''
* Solar cookers are less useful in cloudy weather and near the poles (where the sun is low in the sky or below the horizon), so an alternative cooking source is still required in these conditions. Solar cooking advocates suggest three devices for an integrated cooking solution: a) a solar cooker; b) a fuel-efficient [[cookstove]]; c) an insulated storage container such as a basket filled with straw to store heated food. Very hot food may continue to cook for hours in a well-insulated container. With this three-part solution, fuel use is minimized while still providing hot meals at any hour, reliably.
* Some solar cookers, especially solar ovens, take longer to cook food than a conventional stove or oven. Using solar cookers may require food preparation start hours before the meal. However, it requires less hands-on time during the cooking, so this is often considered a reasonable trade-off.
* Cooks may need to learn special cooking techniques to fry common foods, such as fried eggs or [[flatbread]]s like [[chapati]]s and [[tortilla]]s. It may not be possible to safely or completely cook some thick foods, such as large roasts, loaves of bread, or pots of soup, particularly in small panel cookers; the cook may need to divide these into smaller portions before cooking.
* Some solar cooker designs are affected by strong winds, which can slow the cooking process, cool the food due to convective losses, and disturb the reflector. It may be necessary to anchor the reflector, such as with string and weighted objects like bricks.

== Projects ==
[[File:SOLAR COOKER 001.JPG|thumb|Students perform an experiment using a solar cooker built out of an umbrella]]

Cardboard, aluminium foil, and plastic bags for well over 10,000 solar cookers have been donated to the Iridimi refugee camp and Touloum refugee camps in [[Chad]] by the combined efforts of the [[Jewish World Watch]], the Dutch foundation [[KoZon]], and [[Solar Cookers International]]. The refugees construct the cookers themselves, using the donated supplies and locally purchased [[Arabic gum]].&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;  It has also significantly reduced the amount of time women spend tending open fires each day, with the results that they are healthier and they have more time to grow vegetables for their families and make handicrafts for export.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; By 2007, the [[Jewish World Watch]] had trained 4,500 women and had provided 10,000 solar cookers to refugees. The project has also reduced the number of foraging trips by as much as 70 percent, thus reducing the number of attacks.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Some [[Gaza City|Gazans]] have started to make solar cookers made from cement bricks and mud mixed with straw and two sheets of glass. About 40 to 45 Palestinian households reportedly have started using these solar cookers, including some made with mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Solar Cooking Ovens: Another Eco-Solution from the Gaza Strip |url=https://www.greenprophet.com/2008/11/solar-ovens-gaza-strip/ |website=Green Prophet |accessdate=18 July 2018 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tapis is very light, with an [[API gravity]] of 43°-45°, and very sweet, with only about 0.04% sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=my Malaysia - Analysis], US Energy Information Administration&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.platts.com/latest-news/oil/singapore/malaysian-tapis-oil-field-eor-project-set-to-27172899 Malaysian Tapis oil field EOR project set to start up end 2013: ExxonMobil], Platts&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is not traded on a market like [[Brent Crude]] or [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI), it is often used as an oil marker for Asia and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.com.au/pricing/crude.htm Australian Crude Oil Requirements], Australian Institute of Petroleum.&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of Tapis in Singapore is often considerably higher than the price of benchmark crude oils such as Brent or WTI (those commonly referenced in market commentaries). This is because its greater aromaticity (i.e. higher ° API) allows for greater production of higher-value products, such as petrol, than from Brent or WTI.  Its high price is also due to the purity of the blend. Because it contains less [[sulfur]] it requires less refinery processing than sourer crude oils such as Brent Oil and WTI.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
 
[[Malaysia]] is the only country which has significant amounts of oil produced as Tapis, from fields located in the [[South China Sea]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10075">A '''terminator''' or '''twilight zone''' is a moving line that divides the [[daylight|daylit]] side and the dark [[night]] side of a [[astronomical object|planetary body]]. A terminator is defined as the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points on a [[planet]] or [[natural satellite|moon]] where the line through its parent [[star]] is [[tangent]]. An observer on the terminator of such an orbiting body with an [[atmosphere]] would experience [[twilight]] due to [[light scattering by particles]] in the gaseous layer.

==Earth's terminator==
[[File:ISS flies over Africa, the Mideast, and the Terminator line.ogv|thumb|300px|Video of the Earth from the ISS as it approaches the terminator.]]
{{see also|Earth's shadow}}

On [[Earth]], the terminator is a circle with a diameter that is approximately that of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TiGgJip0l64C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=earth's+terminator+is+circle+size+of+earth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcyqSm5cvUAhUM4WMKHbraCfQQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=earth's%20terminator%20is%20circle%20size%20of%20earth&amp;f=false|title=Carbon in the Geobiosphere: - Earth's Outer Shell -|last=Mackenzie|first=Fred T.|last2=Lerman|first2=Abraham|date=2006-12-29|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402042386|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminator passes through any point on Earth's surface twice a day, at [[sunrise]] and at [[sunset]], apart from [[polar region]]s where this only occurs when the point is not experiencing [[midnight sun]] or [[polar night]]. The circle separates the portion of Earth experiencing daylight from that experiencing darkness (night). While a little over one half of Earth is illuminated at any point in time (with exceptions during [[solar eclipse|eclipse]]s), the terminator path varies by time of day due to [[Earth's rotation]] on its axis. The terminator path also varies by time of year due to [[Earth's orbit]]al revolution around the Sun; thus, the plane of the terminator is nearly parallel to planes created by lines of [[longitude]] during the [[equinox]]es, and its maximum angle is approximately 23.5° to the [[celestial pole|pole]] during the [[solstice]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/Land/day_night.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206103757/http://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/Land/day_night.html |archivedate=2009-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface transit speed===
At the [[Equator]], under flat conditions (without obstructions like mountains or at a height above any such obstructions), the terminator moves at approximately 1,668&amp;nbsp;kilometers per hour (1,036&amp;nbsp;miles per hour). This speed can appear to increase when near obstructions, such as the height of a mountain, as the shadow of the obstruction will be cast over the ground in advance of the terminator along a flat landscape. The speed of the terminator decreases as it approaches the poles, where it can reach a speed of zero (full-day sunlight or darkness).&lt;ref&gt;''Venus Revealed'' by David Harry Grinspoon, page 329&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Supersonic aircraft]] like [[Jet fighter#Second generation jet fighters (mid-1950s to early 1960s)|jet fighter]]s or [[Concorde]] and [[Tupolev Tu-144]] [[supersonic transport]]s are the only aircraft able to overtake the maximum speed of the terminator at the equator. However, slower vehicles can overtake the terminator at higher [[latitude]]s, and it is possible to walk faster than the terminator at the poles, near to the [[equinox]]es. The visual effect is that of seeing the sun rise in the west, or set in the east.

===Grey-line radio propagation===
Strength of [[radio propagation]] changes between day- and night-side of the [[ionosphere]]. This is primarily because the [[D region|D layer]], which absorbs [[High frequency|high frequency signals]], disappears rapidly on the dark side of the terminator, whereas [[E region|the E]] and [[F region|F layer]]s above the [[D region|D layer]] take longer to form.&lt;ref name=Weiss_2011&gt;Adrian Weiss. (2011). ''Ionospheric Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas for the QRP DXer'', pp.&amp;nbsp;1-16, 1-22&amp;ndash;1-24. Green Valley, AZ: Milliwatt QRP Books.&lt;/ref&gt; This time-difference puts the [[ionosphere]] into a unique intermediate state along the terminator, called the “grey line”.&lt;ref name=dx_qsl_net&gt;http://dx.qsl.net/propagation/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amateur radio]] operators take advantage of conditions along the terminator to perform long distance communications. Called "gray-line" or "grey-line" [[Radio propagation|propagation]], this signal path is a type of [[Skywave|skywave propagation]]. Under good conditions, radio waves can travel along the terminator to [[Antipodes|antipodal]] points.&lt;ref name=dx_qsl_net/&gt;

The '''lunar terminator''' is the division between the illuminated and dark hemispheres of the [[Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brahms.phy.vanderbilt.edu/a103/labs/tl_moon.shtml |title=List of basic lunar features |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203074721/http://brahms.phy.vanderbilt.edu/a103/labs/tl_moon.shtml |archivedate=2006-02-03 |df= }}  &lt;/ref&gt; It is the lunar equivalent of the division between [[night]] and [[day]] on the Earth [[spheroid]], although the Moon's much lower rate of rotation&lt;ref&gt;The [[lunar day]] cycle is 29.53 Earth days in length (see [http://cseligman.com/text/sky/rotationvsday.htm]), so the terminator moves across the lunar surface at 15.4 kilometers per hour.&lt;/ref&gt; means it takes longer for it to pass across the surface.

Due to the angle at which [[sunlight]] strikes this portion of the Moon, shadows cast by [[impact crater|craters]] and other geological features are elongated, thereby making such features more apparent to the observer. This phenomenon is similar to the lengthening of shadows on Earth when the Sun is low in the sky. For this reason, much lunar photographic study centers on the illuminated area near the lunar terminator, and the resulting shadows, provide accurate descriptions of the terrain.

===Lunar terminator illusion===
The lunar terminator (or tilt) illusion is an [[optical illusion]] arising from the erroneous expectation of an observer on Earth that the direction of sunlight illuminating the Moon (i.e. a line [[perpendicular]] to the terminator) should correspond with the [[position of the Sun]], but does not appear to do so. The cause of the illusion is simply the observer is not taking into account that the observed slope of a light ray will change across the sky because of the lack of visual clues to establish 3D [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Christopher B. |title=Lunar Terminator Illusion |url=http://chrisjones.id.au/MoonIllusion/|website=Ellipsis: unfinished thought... |accessdate=21 May 2016|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Andrea K. |last1=Myers-Beaghton |first2=Alan L. |last2=Myers |title=The Moon Tilt Illusion |url =http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~amyers/MoonPaper20June.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific significance==
Examination of a terminator can yield information about the surface of a planetary body; for example, the presence of an [[atmosphere]] can create a fuzzier terminator. As the particles within an atmosphere are at a higher elevation, the light source can remain visible even after it has set at ground level. These particles scatter the light, reflecting some of it to the ground. Hence, the sky can remain illuminated even after the sun has set.

[[Low Earth orbit]] satellites take advantage of the fact that certain polar orbits set near the terminator do not suffer from [[eclipse]], therefore their [[solar cell]]s are continuously lit by sunlight. Such orbits are called dawn-dusk orbits, a type of [[Sun-synchronous orbit]]. This prolongs the operational life of a LEO satellite, as onboard battery life is prolonged. It also enables specific experiments that require minimum interference from the Sun, as the designers can opt to install the relevant sensors on the dark side of the satellite.

'''''The Dinosauria''''' is an extensive book on [[dinosaur]]s, compiled by [[David B. Weishampel]], [[Peter Dodson]], and [[Halszka Osmólska]]. It has been published in 2 editions, with the first edition published in 1990, consisting of material from 23 scientists.&lt;ref name="GeologicalMagazine_2007"&gt;Benson R. (2007), "Review: Weishampel D.B., Dodson P. &amp; Osmolska H. 2004.

This '''timeline of volcanism on Earth''' is a list of major [[volcanic eruption]]s of approximately at least magnitude 6 on the [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] (VEI) or equivalent [[sulfur dioxide]] emission around the [[Quaternary]] period.

Some eruptions cooled the global climate—inducing a [[volcanic winter]]—depending on the amount of sulfur dioxide emitted&lt;ref name=ward2009&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ward, Peter L. | authorlink = Peter Langdon Ward | date = 2 April 2009 | title = Sulfur Dioxide Initiates Global Climate Change in Four Ways | journal = [[Thin Solid Films]] | volume = 517 | issue = 11 | pages = 3188–3203 | doi = 10.1016/j.tsf.2009.01.005 |bibcode = 2009TSF...517.3188W }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the magnitude of the eruption.&lt;ref name=robock2009&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Holocene]] epoch, the criteria are less strict because of scarce data availability, partly since later eruptions have destroyed the evidence. So, the known large eruptions after the [[Paleogene]] period are listed, and especially those relating to the [[Yellowstone hotspot]], the [[Santorini caldera]], and the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Only some eruptions before the [[Neogene]] period are listed.

Active volcanoes such as [[Stromboli]], [[Mount Etna]] and [[Kilauea]] do not appear on this list, but some [[back-arc basin]] volcanoes that generated calderas do appear. Some dangerous volcanoes in "populated areas" appear many times: so Santorini, six times and Yellowstone hotspot, twenty-one times. The Bismarck volcanic arc, [[New Britain]], and the [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]], [[New Zealand]], appear often too.

In addition to the events listed below, are many examples of eruptions in the Holocene on the Kamchatka Peninsula,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kscnet.ru/ivs/volcanoes/holocene/main/main.htm|title=Holocene Kamchatka volcanoes.

Note:
Caldera names tend to change over time. For example, Okataina Caldera, Haroharo Caldera, Haroharo volcanic complex, Tarawera volcanic complex had the same magma source in the Taupo Volcanic Zone.  Yellowstone Caldera, Henry's Fork Caldera, Island Park Caldera, Heise Volcanic Field had all Yellowstone hotspot as magma source.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4391">'''Topological degeneracy''' is a phenomenon in [[quantum many-body physics]], that the [[ground state]] of a [[gapped many-body system]] becomes degenerate in the [[large system size limit]], and that such a degeneracy cannot be lifted by any [[local perturbation]]s as long as the system size is large.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xiao-Gang Wen]] and [[Qian Niu]], [http://dao.mit.edu/~wen/pub/topWN.pdf Phys. Rev. '''B41''', 9377 (1990), "Ground state degeneracy of the FQH states in presence of random potential and on high genus Riemann surfaces"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Topological degeneracy can be used to protect qubits which allows [[Topological quantum computer|topological quantum computation]].&lt;ref&gt;Chetan Nayak, [[Steven H. Simon]], [[Ady Stern]], [[Michael Freedman]], [[Sankar Das Sarma]],  "Non-Abelian Anyons and Topological Quantum Computation",  Rev. Mod. Phys. 80, 1083 (2008); [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0707.1889 arXiv:0707.1889]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is believed  that topological degeneracy implies [[topological order]] (or long-range entanglement &lt;ref&gt;
Xie Chen, Zheng-Cheng Gu, [[Xiao-Gang Wen]],
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.3835 Local unitary transformation, long-range quantum entanglement, wave function renormalization, and topological order] Phys. Rev. B 82, 155138 (2010)
&lt;/ref&gt;) in the ground state.&lt;ref name=wen&gt;[[Xiao-Gang Wen]], [http://dao.mit.edu/~wen/pub/topo.pdf Topological Orders in Rigid States.] ''Int. J. Mod. Phys''. '''B4''', 239 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Many-body states with topological degeneracy are described by [[topological quantum field theory]] at low energies.

==Background==

Topological degeneracy was first introduced to physically define topological order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xiao-Gang Wen]], Phys. Rev. B, '''40''', 7387 (1989), "Vacuum Degeneracy of Chiral Spin State in Compactified Spaces"&lt;/ref&gt;
In two-dimensional space, the topological degeneracy depends on the topology of space, and the topological degeneracy on high genus Riemann  surfaces encode all information on the [[quantum dimensions]] and the fusion algebra of the quasiparticles. In particular, the topological degeneracy on torus is equal to the number of quasiparticles types.

The topological degeneracy also appears in the situation with topological defects (such as vortices, dislocations, holes in 2D sample, ends of a 1D sample, etc.), where the topological degeneracy depends on the number of defects. Braiding those topological defect leads to topologically protected non-Abelian [[geometric phase]], which can be used to perform topologically protected [[quantum computation]].

The topological degeneracy also appear in non-interacting fermion systems (such as p+ip superconductors&lt;ref&gt;N. Read and D. Green, Phys. Rev. B61, 10267 (2000); arXiv:cond-mat/9906453; "Paired states of fermions in two dimensions with breaking of parity and time-reversal symmetries, and the fractional quantum Hall effect"&lt;/ref&gt;) with trapped defects (such as vortices). In non-interacting fermion systems, there is only one type of topological degeneracy
where number of the degenerate states is given by &lt;math&gt;2^{N_d/2}/2&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt;N_d&lt;/math&gt; is the number of the defects (such as the number of  vortices).
Such topological degeneracy is referred as "Majorana zero-mode" on the defects.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, there are many types of topological degeneracy for interacting systems.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Vermont Land Trust''' is a non-profit environmental organization in the U.S. state of [[Vermont]], working to conserve productive, recreational, and scenic lands which give the state and its communities their rural character.

==Mission statement==
The mission of the Vermont Land Trust is that current and future generations are deeply connected to the land and benefit from its deliberate protection and responsible stewardship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vlt.org/about/|title=About: the Vermont Land Trust conserves farms and forests for the future.|work=Vermont Land Trust|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The Vermont Land Trust was founded in 1977 by a group of citizens concerned about the rapidly accelerating development that threatened open space in Vermont. The founding group feared that state legislation [[Act 250]] and local zoning was not strong enough to protect the rural character of the state.

==Operation==
The trust provides the money to purchase undeveloped land when necessary. It then protects the land with a special [[Conservation easement|easement]] which prevents development. It then sells the land to interested purchasers, which may be the state government. In selling the land, the trust principal is continually renewed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;!---this is top-of-the head and can certainly be replaced. Needs footnote in any case---&gt;

It works with [[The Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Joseph | last=Gresser | title=Land trust meeting begins in cedar swamp | url=| work= | publisher=the Chronicle | location=Barton, Vermont | pages= 32 | date=23 September 2009 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officers==

'''Water Efficiency Labelling and Standard (WELS)''' is a labeling scheme initiated by the [[Australian Government]] to help Australian households [[water conservation|conserve water]] and money. On 1 July 2006, it became mandatory across [[Australia]] to carry a (WELS) Water Rating label when selling showers, [[washing machine]]s, [[dishwasher]]s, toilet equipment, [[urinal]] equipment and [[tap (valve)|tap]] equipment intended for use over kitchen [[sink]]s, [[bathroom]] basins, [[laundry]] tubs or ablution troughs.
