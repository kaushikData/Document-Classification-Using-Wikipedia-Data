==Plot==
The story is set in 1979, in a [[Santa Barbara, California]] boarding house. The semi-autobiographical protagonist is Jamie ([[Lucas Jade Zumann]]), a 15-year-old high school student. His mother, Dorothea ([[Annette Bening]]), a divorcee, runs the boarding house. Abbie ([[Greta Gerwig]]), a tenant, is a photographer, and is being treated for [[cervical cancer]]. William ([[Billy Crudup]]), another tenant, is a carpenter and mechanic, who lived on a hippie commune. Jamie's best friend is Julie ([[Elle Fanning]]), who often spends the night with Jamie but does not want to have sex with him because it would destroy their friendship.

Dorothea, concerned that she cannot connect with her son, asks Julie and Abbie to help raise him. When Jamie learns about his mother's plan, he runs away to Los Angeles with his friends to attend a rock concert. When Jamie returns from the show, Julie tells him that she had unprotected sex with a classmate and is worried that she is pregnant. Jamie buys a [[pregnancy test]] for Julie, which comes back negative. Jamie also offers Abbie moral support by accompanying her to her doctor's appointment, where Abbie learns that she is cancer-free, but will likely be unable to have children. To thank Jamie, Abbie tells him her life story: that she was forced to leave her friends in New York and return to Santa Barbara after her cancer diagnosis, brought on by her mother's use of fertility drug [[Diethylstilbestrol|DES]].

One day, Dorothea and Julie discuss the fact that Dorothea has only pursued relationships with "safe" men, as opposed to men she is truly attracted to, like William. Dorothea then asks Abbie to show her the modern world. At a punk club, William kisses Dorothea, but she rejects him on account of his sexual relationship with Abbie. When William does end the relationship with Abbie, Abbie warns Jamie and Julie that they must leave Santa Barbara if they want to succeed in life.

Later, Abbie takes Jamie to a rock club where he gets drunk and kisses a girl. Meanwhile, Dorothea teaches William how to pursue a relationship with women, as opposed to seeking one night stands. When Abbie and Jamie return, Abbie shows Dorothea photographs she took of Jamie. Dorothea realizes that Jamie will never feel totally comfortable around her.

Jamie becomes curious about female sexuality, and Abbie lends him a book on gender inequality; when he reads it to Dorothea, she asks Abbie to stop teaching him about the feminist movement. The tension between Abbie and Dorothea comes to a head during a tenant dinner, where Abbie announces that she is menstruating. She grows angry at the tenants' discomfort and makes all of the men at the table say the word "[[menstruation]]". This inspires Julie to recount her first sexual encounter, which upsets Jamie. Jamie tells her that he no longer wants her to spend the night.

Julie is hurt, but convinces Jamie to take a road trip along the California coastline. Jamie tells Julie that he loves her, but Julie says she cares about him too much to have sex. A fight ensues, during which Julie accuses him of only being nice to have sex with her, and Jamie disappears. By the time Dorothea, William and Abbie arrive to search for him, Jamie has returned. Jamie admits to Dorothea that he was hurt when she asked Abbie and Julie for help because it made her seem incapable of raising him. Dorothea tells Jamie about her relationship with Jamie's father.

The film ends with the main characters describing the rest of their lives in voice-overs. Julie moved to New York City to attend college, eventually losing touch with Jamie and Dorothea. She fell in love with a classmate and moved to Paris. They decided to not have children. Abbie stayed in Santa Barbara, marrying and starting a photography studio in her garage. Her photographs got displayed in local galleries. Against her doctor's advice, she conceived two boys by age 34. William lived with Dorothea for another year before moving to Arizona to open a pottery store and marrying twice. Dorothea met a man and stayed with him until her death in 1999 of cancer caused by her smoking.  A few years after Dorothea's death, Jamie married and had a son. He tries to describe Dorothea to his son, but finds it to be impossible.

== Production ==

===Development===
Mills took inspiration from his mother and sister to create the characters of Dorothea and Abbie, stating: "It felt like I was raised by my mom and sisters, so I was always appealing to women in the punk scene or women in my world. I always leaned to them to figure out my life as a straight white guy. So I wanted to make a movie about that.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/awards/mike-mills-20th-century-women-annette-bening-1201882075/|title=Mike Mills Digs Within Once More With ‘20th Century Women’|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|first=Kristopher|last=Tapley|date=October 7, 2016|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the character of Jamie reflects his own experiences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/20th-century-women-mike-mills-interview/#poster|title='20th Century Women’: Mike Mills on the Story’s Response to ‘Beginners’, the Necessity of DIY Spaces|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex Media]]|first=Brian|last=Formo|date=December 20, 2016|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills wrote the character of Julie based on the experiences of one of his friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/12/mike-mills-on-directing-20th-century-women.html|title=20th Century Women Director Mike Mills on Disliking Seinfeld, Giving Hugs on Set, and Looking for Truthiness|website=Vulture|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York Media]]|first=Kyle|last=Buchanan|date=December 28, 2016|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills has also described the film as a "loveletter" to the women who raised him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/reviews/a41555/20th-century-women-mike-mills-interview/|publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]|title=Mike Mills' New Film Is a Love Letter to the Women in His Life|website=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|first=Ben|last=Dickinson|date=December 20, 2016|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though the film is autobiographical, he also noted that it is fictionalized, explaining, "With all these characters, what guides me is the real person. Of course, I’m cinematizing real people, and you can never get them right or show all of their dimensions, but that’s very much what my mom was like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativescreenwriting.com/20th-century-women/|title="What guides me is the real person."

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film entered wide release in the United States on January 20, 2017, grossing $1,385,336 in its first weekend, ranking 17th overall. It went on to gross a total of $5,664,764.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeb|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&amp;id=20thcenturywomen.htm&amp;sort=wkly&amp;order=DESC&amp;p=.htm |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher=[[IMDb]] |title=20th Century Women - Weekly Box Office Results |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 89% based on 209 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''20th Century Women'' offers Annette Bening a too-rare opportunity to shine in a leading role — and marks another assured step forward for writer-director Mike Mills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/20th_century_women/|title=20th Century Women (2016)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/20th-century-women|title=20th Century Women reviews|website=[[Metacritic.com]]|accessdate=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a positive review, writing: "The best thing about the movie is Bening’s performance as Dorothea Fields, who’s portrayed as a very particular kind of contradictory free spirit. Divorced and proud, with a lot of heart and soul but even more over-sharing flakiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/20th-century-women-review-new-york-film-festival-1201879299/|title=New York Film Review: ‘20th Century Women|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|date=October 9, 2016|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' also gave the film a positive review, writing: "Mills uses some of the same devices as ''Beginners'' to illuminate his characters' cultural formation, notably historic montages of their birth years or backgrounds prior to coming together. And he also glances ahead to their future lives, after the arc of the movie. But the quilting is more seamless here because the eccentricities are so integral to the writing and performances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/20th-century-women-nyff-936007|title='20th Century Women' Review|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|first=David|last=Rooney|date=October 9, 2016|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ConstantinopleMap1911.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A map of [[Istanbul]], 1911.]]

The '''Architecture of Istanbul''' describes a large mixture of structures which reflect the many influences that have made an indelible mark in all districts of the city. The ancient part of the city (the historic peninsula) is still partially surrounded by the [[Walls of Constantinople]], erected in 5th century by the Emperor [[Theodosius II]] to protect the city from invasion. The architecture inside the city proper contains buildings, statues, and functional constructions which came from  [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Genoa|Genoese]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], and modern [[Turkey|Turkish]] sources. The city has many architecturally significant entities. Throughout its long history, Istanbul has acquired a reputation for being a cultural and ethnic melting pot. As a result, there are many historical mosques, churches, synagogues, palaces, castles and towers to visit in the city.

==Ancient Greek and Roman structures==

===Serpentine Column===
[[Image:Snake column Hippodrome Constantinople 2007.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The [[Serpentine Column]], the oldest surviving Greek monument in Istanbul]]
One of the oldest monuments still surviving from antiquity is the [[Serpentine Column]], a monument built originally to honor Apollo for the victory over the Persians at [[Plataea]] in 479 BC. The column was moved by [[Constantine the Great]] when Constantinople became the new capital, and has stood at the [[Hippodrome]] ever since. A member of the Polish Embassy visiting in 1700 damaged the top of it severely, breaking off the serpent heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Menage |first=V. L.|title=The Serpent Column in Ottoman Sources|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the heads are preserved at the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum|Archaeological Museum]] in Istanbul.

===Column of Constantine===
The most important monuments of Roman architecture in the city include the [[Column of Constantine]] ({{lang-tr|Çemberlitaş}}), which was erected in 330 by [[Constantine the Great]] for marking the declaration of the new capital city of the [[Roman Empire]] and contained several fragments of the [[True Cross]] and other artifacts belonging to [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Virgin Mary]], the ''Mazulkemer Aqueduct'', the [[Valens Aqueduct]], the [[Column of the Goths]] at the Seraglio Point, the [[Milion]] which served for calculating the distances between Constantinople and other cities of the Roman Empire, and the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]] which was built following the model of the [[Circus Maximus]] in [[Rome]].

==Byzantine and Genoese structures==

{{further|List of Byzantine monuments in Istanbul}}

===Walls of Constantinople and environs===
Construction of the [[Walls of Constantinople]] began under Constantine the Great, who enlarged the previously existing walls of Byzantium in order to defend the new Roman capital city which quickly grew following its proclamation as Nova Roma. A new set of walls was built further west during the reign of Theodosius II, and rebuilt after an earthquake in 447 in their current shape. The ''sea walls'' in the Seraglio Point area, which have continuously existed since Lygos and Byzantium, are the oldest part of the city walls; while the ''triple land walls'' of Theodosius II at the western end of the city are the strongest parts. The northwestern section of the land walls was built in 627, during the reign of [[Heraclius]], in order to accommodate the suburb of [[Blachernae]], and added to by later emperors. The city walls had 55 gates, the largest of which was the Porta Aurea (Golden Gate), the ceremonial entrance gate used by the Emperors, at the southwestern end of the triple land walls, close to the Sea of Marmara. Unlike the city walls which were built of brick and limestone, the Porta Aurea was built of large clean-cut white marble blocks in order to distinguish it from the rest, and a quadriga with elephant statues stood on its top.&lt;ref name=aurea&gt;[http://www.byzantium1200.com/p-aura.html Byzantium 1200: Porta Aurea]&lt;/ref&gt; The doors of the Porta Aurea were made of gold, hence the name, which means "Golden Gate" in Latin.&lt;ref name=aurea /&gt; In 1458 the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II built the Yedikule ("Seven Towers") Castle to defend the Porta Aurea, which was incorporated into this castle and still stands as a part of the pentagon-shaped layout of the castle walls. The [[Column of Marcian]] ({{lang-tr|Kıztaşı}}) erected by [[Marcianus]] (reigned 450–457) dates from the same period as the triple land walls of Theodosius II.

The most extant Byzantine structure which has survived from the reign of [[Heraclius]] (610–641) is the [[Prison of Anemas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/sh/?txt=istanbul%3Aanemas+dungeons Emporis: Anemas Dungeons]&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated into the city walls, at [[Blachernae]]. It is a huge castle-like structure with several towers and a network of underground Byzantine prisons.

===Hagia Sophia and Little Hagia Sophia===
[[Image:Hagia Sophia B12-40.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Hagia Sophia]], built by [[Justinian the Great|Justinian]] between 532 and 537, is widely regarded as the masterpiece of [[Byzantine architecture]]. It was the largest ever cathedral built in the world for more than a thousand years, until the completion of the [[Seville Cathedral]] in 1575, during the [[Renaissance]]]]
The early Byzantine architecture followed the classical Roman model of domes and arches, but further improved these architectural concepts, as evidenced with the Hagia Sophia which was designed by Isidorus and Anthemius as the third church to rise on this location, between 532 and 537, following the [[Nika riots]] (532) during which the second church was destroyed (the first church, known as the ''Megala Ekklessia'' ("Great Church") was inaugurated by [[Constantius II]] in 360; the second church was inaugurated by Theodosius II in 405, while the third and current one was inaugurated by [[Justinian the Great|Justinian]] in 537). The [[Little Hagia Sophia|Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus]] (little Hagia Sophia), which was the first church built by Justinian in Constantinople and edificed between 527 and 536, had earlier signaled such an improvement in the design of domed buildings, which require complex solutions for carrying the structure. The present-day [[Hagia Irene]] (which was originally built by Constantine in the 4th century, but was later enlarged by Justinian in the 6th century) and the [[Basilica Cistern]] are also from this period.

===Stoudios Monastery===
Most Byzantine churches that were built or enlarged by Justinian in the 6th century were originally built in the 4th century at the time of Constantine. The oldest surviving Byzantine church in Istanbul with its original form is the [[Stoudios|Stoudios (İmrahor) Monastery]], which was built in 462. The monastery is also known as ''St. John Stoudios'' because it was dedicated to [[St. John the Baptist]]. The roof of the building doesn't exist today, but its surrounding walls as well as its splendid floor decorations are still intact. Many important decisions regarding Christianity were made inside this building, including the heated debates on the identity of [[Virgin Mary]] (whether or not she was ''[[Theotokos]]'' (''Mother of God'') and whether it was right to condemn [[Nestorius]] who opposed this definition) as well as the debates and clashes on [[Iconoclasm]].

===Hagia Irene===
[[Image:Hagia Eirene.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The 4th century [[Hagia Irene]], built by [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], is the oldest standing Byzantine church in the city]]
Following the decision by [[Theodora II|Theodora]], wife of Theophilus, to restore the icons in 843, many churches and other prominent Byzantine buildings in the city were adorned with new icons, but some, like [[Hagia Irene]], still bear the signs of the iconoclastic period. The [[Boukoleon Palace]] largely dates from the reign of [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byzantium1200.com/boucoleon.html Byzantium 1200: Boukoleon Palace]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blachernae Palace and the Palace of Porphryogenitus===
The [[Palace of the Porphyrogenitus]] ({{lang-tr|Tekfur Sarayı}}), which is the only surviving part of the [[Blachernae|Blachernae Palace]], dates from the period of the Fourth Crusade. In these years, on the northern side of the [[Golden Horn]], the Dominican priests of the Catholic Church built the [[Arap Mosque|Church of Saint Paul]] in 1233.

===Chora Church and Pammakaristos Church===
{{main|Chora Church|Pammakaristos Church}}
[[Image:Chora Church Constantinople 2007 panorama 002.jpg|thumb|150|The [[Chora Church]], known as the Kariye Muzesi]]
The most important churches which were built after the Byzantines took Constantinople back in 1261 include the [[Chora Church]] and the [[Pammakaristos Church]]. The final structure of the Chora Church that exists reflects the five additions that were finished during the tenure of the last ''ktetor'', Theodore Metochites, from 1316 to 1321. In the year 1511 the church was officially converted into a mosque, and named Kariye Camii. In 1945, the mosque was converted into a museum, and has been named Kariye Muzesi to this day. After many centuries, only the church, the southern chapel, and another building to the north remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Necipoğlu|first=Nevra|title=Byzantine Constantinople: Monuments, Topography and Everyday Life|publisher=BRILL|year=2001|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pammakaristos Church]] was constructed in the early part of the 12th century for [[Michael VII Ducas]] and his wife Mary (sister of [[Alexius II Comnenus]]). It was the largest church in the city at that time that served a monastery for women. Before the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, the [[sarcophagus|sarcophagii]] of [[Alexius I Comnenus]] and his daughter Anna rested within the chapel inside the monastery. In 1453, the nuns were removed, but the church was allowed to remain untouched, except for a giant cross which existed on the dome. The cross was removed by Sultan [[Suleiman]] in 1547 after numerous complaints. In 1586, Sultan [[Murad III]] converted it into a mosque, naming it the Fethiye Camii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grosvenor|first=Edwin A.|title=Constantinople|publisher=Roberts Brothers|year=1895|pages=435–437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palazzo del Comune===
[[Image:Istanbul da Üsküdar.jpg|thumb|left|The famous [[Maiden's Tower, Istanbul|Maiden's (Leander's) Tower]] was originally built as a wooden structure by Emperor Alexios Komnenos]]
Also in this period, the [[Genoa|Genoese]] [[Podestà]] of [[Galata]], Montano de Marinis, built the ''Palazzo del Comune'' (1314), a copy of the San Giorgio Palace in [[Genoa]], which still stands in ruins on the back streets of ''Bankalar Caddesi'' in Galata, together with its adjacent buildings and numerous Genoese houses from the early 14th century.

===Leander's Tower===
Ancient [[Athenian]] general [[Alcibiades]], after the [[Battle of Cyzicus|naval victory at Cyzicus]], possibly built a custom station for ships coming from Black Sea on a small rock in front of [[Üsküdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]] (today's üsküdar).&lt;ref name=mw334&gt;Müller-Wiener (1976), p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; In 1110 [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius Comnenus]] built on this site a wooden tower protected by a stone wall.&lt;ref name=mw334/&gt; The structure, known as Leander's Tower after the legend of [[Hero and Leander]] (which took place in the [[Dardanelles]]), was rebuilt and restored several times by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], until in 1763 it was erected using stone.&lt;ref name=mw334/&gt; The most recent restoration took place in 1998. Steel supports were added around the ancient tower as a precaution after the [[1999 İzmit earthquake]].

===Galata Tower===
[[Image:Galata tower istanbul.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Galata Tower]] dominates the skyline of the medieval [[Galata|Genoese citadel]] at the northern shore of the [[Golden Horn]], facing the Old City (peninsula of [[Constantinople]]) at the southern shore]]
The Genoese also built the [[Galata Tower]], which they named as ''Christea Turris'' (Tower of Christ), at the highest point of the citadel of Galata, in 1348.

==Ottoman structures==
[[Image:Topkapi Palace from Galata Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Topkapı Palace]]]]
The Ottoman Turks built the [[Anadoluhisarı]] on the Asian side of the Bosphorus in 1394, and the [[Rumelihisarı]] at the opposite (European) shore, in 1452, a year before the conquest of [[Constantinople]]. The main purpose of these castles, armed with the long range ''Balyemez'' (''Faule Metze'') cannons, was to block the sea traffic of the Bosphorus and prevent the support ships from the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] colonies on the [[Black Sea]] ports, such as [[Caffa]], [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]], and [[Amasra]], from reaching Constantinople and helping the Byzantines during the Turkish siege of the city.

Following the Ottoman conquest of the city, Sultan [[Mehmed II]] initiated a wide scale reconstruction plan, which included the construction of grand buildings such as the [[Eyüp Sultan Mosque]], [[Fatih Mosque]], [[Topkapı Palace]], [[Grand Bazaar, Istanbul|The Grand Bazaar]] and the [[Yedikule|Yedikule (Seven Towers) Castle]] which guarded the main entrance gate of the city, the Porta Aurea (Golden Gate). In the centuries following Mehmed II, many new important buildings, such as the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]], [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Sultanahmet Mosque]], [[New Mosque (Istanbul)|Yeni Mosque]] and numerous others were constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gül, Murat &amp;|first=Howells, Trevor|title=Istanbul Architecture|publisher=Watermark Press|year=2013|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sultan Ahmed Mosque Istanbul Turkey retouched.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]]]]
Traditionally, Ottoman buildings were built of ornate wood. Only "state buildings" such as palaces and mosques were built of stone. Starting from the 18th and 19th centuries, wood was gradually replaced with stone as the primary building material, while traditional Ottoman architectural styles were gradually replaced with European styles, such as the [[Baroque]] style interiors of the Aynalıkavak Palace (1677–1679) and Nuruosmaniye Mosque (1748–1755, the first Baroque style mosque in the city, also famous for its Baroque fountain), and the 18th century Baroque additions to the Harem section of Topkapı Palace. Following the [[Tanzimat]] reforms which effectively started Turkey's Europeanization process in 1839, new palaces and mosques were built in [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] styles, or a mixture of all three, such as the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]], [[Beylerbeyi Palace]] and [[Ortaköy Mosque|Ortaköy (Mecidiye) Mosque]] designed and constructed by the [[Balyan family]] members:&lt;ref name=balyan&gt;[http://www.turkishculture.org/architecture/architects/balian-family-872.htm] Turkish Cultural Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;
. Even [[Neo-Gothic]] mosques were built, such as the [[Pertevniyal Valide Sultan Mosque]] and [[Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque]]. Large state buildings like schools or military barracks were also built in various European styles.
[[Image:Ortakoey Istanbul Bosporusbruecke Mrz2005.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ortaköy Mosque]] and the [[Bosphorus Bridge]]]]
Starting from the early 19th century, the areas around [[İstiklal Avenue]] were filled with grandiose embassy buildings belonging to prominent European states, and rows of European (mostly Neoclassical and later [[Art Nouveau]]) style buildings started to appear on both flanks of the avenue. Istanbul especially became a major center of the Art Nouveau movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with famous architects of this style like [[Raimondo D'Aronco]] building many palaces and mansions in the city proper and on the [[Princes' Islands]]. His most important works in the city include several buildings of the [[Yıldız Palace]] complex, and the ''Botter House'' on İstiklal Avenue. The famous ''[[Camondo]] Stairs'' on Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in [[Karaköy]] ([[Galata]]) is also a beautiful example of Art Nouveau architecture. Other important examples are the ''Hıdiv Kasrı'' (Khedive Palace) on the Asian side of the Bosphorus, ''Flora Han'' in [[Sirkeci]], and ''Frej Apartmanı'' in the Şişhane quarter of [[Beyoğlu]].

Thus, by the mid-19th century, the southern part of the [[Golden Horn]] (the historic peninsula of Constantinople) had a traditionally Ottoman Turkish appearance and population, while the northern part of the Golden Horn became more and more Europeanized both in terms of architecture and in terms of demographics. The [[Galata Bridge]] had become a connection between the oriental and occidental (southern and northern) parts of the European side of Istanbul.

The [[Bosphorus]] was regarded as a summer resort during the Ottoman period and the traditional wooden houses and mansions, called ''[[Yalı (residence)|yalı]]'', were the choice of the wealthy Ottoman elite. Most of the development happened during the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Period]], a period which is best represented by the [[Sadullah Paşa Yalısı]] built in 1783. The oldest surviving yalı is the [[Amcazade Köprülü Hüseyin Pasha]] yalı located in Kandilli on the Asiatic shores of the Bosphorus and dates from 1699. The wooden seaside chalet mansions retained their basic architectural principles until the middle of the 19th century, when they were gradually replaced by less flammable brick houses especially during the [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First Constitutional Period]]. The development of [[yalı]]s lasted until the [[First World War]].
{{wide image|Dolmabahçe Palace (cropped).JPG|850px|align-cap=center|The [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] was built in 1856, served as the main administrative center of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1856 to 1922, apart from a 22-year interval (1887–1909) in which [[Yıldız Palace]] was used.}}

The society was originally the idea of the lawyer [[Charles Henry Bellenden Ker|Bellenden Ker]] and was founded at a meeting in the house of the famous painter [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles Eastlake]], attended by Eastlake, Ker, Giovanni Aubrey Bezzi, and Edmund Oldfield. The society's purpose was to promote knowledge of the art works of the old Italian, Flemish, and other European masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Nineteenth Century|title=The Arundel Society|author=[[William Henry Gregory|Gregory.

The '''Arundel Club''' was a society founded in London in 1904 for the purpose of continuing more effectively the work of the Arundel Society, which had encouraged the study of art by reproducing the best works of the old masters.

'''''Belle''''' is a 2013 British [[Historical period drama|period]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Amma Asante]], written by [[Misan Sagay]] and produced by [[Damian Jones]].

The film is inspired by the 1779 painting of [[Dido Elizabeth Belle]] beside her cousin [[Lady Elizabeth Murray]], at [[Kenwood House]], which was commissioned by their great-uncle, [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]], then [[Lord Chief Justice of England]]. Very little is known about the life of Dido Belle, who was born in the [[West Indies]] and was the illegitimate [[mixed-race]] daughter of Mansfield's nephew. She is found living in poverty by her father and entrusted to the care of Mansfield and his wife. The fictional film centres on Dido's relationship with an aspiring lawyer; it is set at a time of legal significance, as a court case is heard on what became known as the [[Zong massacre|''Zong'' massacre]], when slaves were thrown overboard from a slave ship and the owner filed with his insurance company for the losses. Lord Mansfield rules on this case in England's [[Court of King's Bench]] in 1786, in a decision seen to contribute to the [[Abolition of the Slave Trade Act of 1807]].

==Plot==
Dido Elizabeth Belle Lindsay was born in 1761, the natural daughter of Maria Belle, an enslaved African woman in the West Indies, and Captain Sir John Lindsay, a British [[Royal Navy]] officer. After Dido's mother's death in 1765, Captain Lindsay takes her from the West Indies slums and entrusts her to his uncle William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], and his wife Elizabeth, who live at [[Kenwood House]], an estate in [[Hampstead]] outside London. Lord and Lady Mansfield raise Dido as a free gentlewoman, along with their niece Lady Elizabeth Murray, who came to live with them after her mother died and her father remarried. When the two cousins reach adulthood, the Mansfields commission an oil portrait of their two great-nieces, but Dido is unhappy about sitting for it as she is worried that it will portray her as a subordinate, similar to other portraits she has seen depicting aristocrats with black servants. Dido's father dies and leaves her the generous sum of £2,000 a year, enough to make her an heiress. Lady Elizabeth, by contrast, will have no income from her father, whose son from his new wife has been named his sole heir. Arrangements are made for Elizabeth to have her coming-out to society, but Lord and Lady Mansfield believe no gentleman will agree to marry Dido because of her mixed-race status, so while she will travel to London with her cousin, she will not be "out" to society.

Lord Mansfield agrees to take a vicar's son, John Davinier, into an apprenticeship for law. In 1783, Mansfield hears the case of ''[[Gregson v. Gilbert]]'', regarding the payment of an insurance claim, for slaves killed when thrown overboard by the captain of a slave-ship &amp;mdash; an event now known as the [[Zong Massacre|''Zong'' massacre]]. Dido helps her uncle with his correspondence and after John tells her about the ''Zong'' case, she begins sneaking correspondence to him which he believes will advance the cause of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]]. Lord Mansfield and John have a disagreement on the main issue of the case. John is told not to see Dido again, and his apprenticeship is at an end.  Dido’s aunts, Lady Mansfield and Lady Mary Murray, Lord Mansfield's sister, seek to steer Dido into an engagement with Oliver Ashford, son of a scheming grand dame and younger brother to the bigoted James Ashford. At first James is interested in Elizabeth but stops courting her once he discovers she will have no inheritance. Oliver, who is without fortune, proposes to Dido and she accepts, although she continues to see John. James takes Dido aside, tells her she will disgrace his family's name, then insults and manhandles her. Dido later tells Elizabeth of his true character and says she will give part of her inheritance to her for a dowry so she can find a different match. Lord Mansfield finds out about Dido's visits to John and confronts both of them. During the confrontation, John professes his love for Dido. Sometime later, Dido meets with Oliver and breaks off their engagement.

Dido is relieved when the painting is unveiled, showing her as Elizabeth's equal. She tells Lord Mansfield that the portrait commission proves that he can defy convention. Dido sneaks into the balcony of the Inn of Court, so that she can hear Lord Mansfield narrowly rule that the Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in Liverpool, is not due insurance payments for the slaves the crew threw overboard during the voyage. The ship's officers claimed they ordered this action because they were out of potable water. Lord Mansfield discovers, however, that the ''Zong'' passed by many ports without stopping for more water, before killing the slaves. It appeared to Lord Mansfield that the slaves' quarters were over-crowded, making them sick and not likely to fetch a high price at auction, so the officers decided they would be worth more in insurance payments after their loss. Lord Mansfield sees John and Dido outside the Court after his ruling and says that Dido can only marry a gentleman. Therefore, he agrees to resume John's apprenticeship in law, so that he can become a lawyer. Dido and John share a kiss, both in full acknowledgement of their romantic feelings.

On-screen text informs the viewer that Dido and John married and had two sons (they actually had three), that Elizabeth also married and had children, and that the painting hung at Kenwood House until 1922, when it was moved to Scone Palace in Scotland, the birthplace of Lord Mansfield.

==Cast==

==Painting==
[[File:Dido Elizabeth Belle.jpg|thumb|1779 painting of [[Dido Elizabeth Belle]] (1761–1804) and her cousin [[Lady Elizabeth Murray]] (1760–1825).]]
The 1779 painting, once thought to be by [[Johann Zoffany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dido and Elizabeth Portrait|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/images/people-faces/portraits/__upload__img_200__18_dido.jpg|website=English Heritage|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now attributed to [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]]&lt;ref&gt;Fake or Fortune?, Season 7, Episode 4&lt;/ref&gt;. The painting hung in [[Kenwood House]] until 1922 and now hangs at [[Scone Palace]] in [[Perthshire]], [[Scotland]]. It was one of the first European portraits to portray a black subject on an equal eye-line with a white aristocrat, though distinctions are implied by the poses, as Elizabeth's "formality and bookishness are contrasted with the wild and exotically turbanned 'natural' figure of Belle."&lt;ref&gt;Bindman, David, &amp; [[Henry Louis Gates]], ''The Image of the Black in Western Art'', Harvard University Press, 2010, xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heritage1"&gt;English Heritage, {{cite web|title=Slavery and Justice at Kenwood House, Part 1|url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/imported-docs/p-t/leafletslave1final.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2014|publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is replicated in the film with the faces of the actresses portraying the characters replacing those in the original. Dido's finger-to-cheek gesture is absent in the fictionalised version, as is her feathered turban. The original picture is shown on screen at the end of the film.

==Production==
Filming began on 24 September 2012.

Production designer [[Simon Bowles]] created the 18th-century Bristol Docks on the [[Isle of Man]] and created Kenwood House, based on a number of stately homes in the London area.

Original music for the film was composed by [[Rachel Portman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2013/05/08/rachel-portman-scoring-belle |title=Rachel Portman Scoring ‘Belle’ |work=Film Music Reporter |date=8 May 2013 |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical references==
The film is a work of historical fiction, inspired by a painting and the evidence that Dido was brought up at [[Kenwood House]]. The relative lack of details about Dido Elizabeth Belle allowed screenwriter Misan Sagay considerable artistic licence in framing the young woman's story, within the broader historical context of the slave economy and the abolition movement.

The only other direct historical reference made about Belle, other than the painting and Thomas Hutchinson's personal diary, appear in ''Elements of Moral Science'', a 1790 work by the Scottish professor of moral philosophy [[James Beattie (poet)|James Beattie]], who met Belle and in the book states she recited poetry with "a degree of elegance"&lt;ref&gt;page 225&lt;/ref&gt; equal to any English child of her age, arguing against the then prevailing theory that "negroes are naturally and utterly incapable of distinct articulation".&lt;ref&gt;again page 225&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]], who was [[Lord Chief Justice of England]] from 1756 to 1788, presided over two important cases, ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'' in 1772 and the [[Zong massacre#Legal proceedings|''Zong'' insurance claims case]] in 1783, which helped lay the groundwork for Britain's  [[Slave Trade Act 1807]]. As in the film, he was the great-uncle of [[Dido Elizabeth Belle]] and [[Lady Elizabeth Murray]].

At the suggestion of the producers, [[HarperCollins]] published a companion book ''"Belle - The Slave Daughter and the Lord Chief Justice"'' by biographer [[Paula Byrne]] recounting the lives of the film's principal characters.

==Historical accuracy==
Sagay chose to set the major events; Belle's and Elizabeth's love affairs and the Zong case, in the same year the painting was made - when Belle was about 18. In reality, Belle married at 32, long after Lady Elizabeth was married and no longer in touch with Belle. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scriptsandscribes.com/2014/05/qa-with-misan-sagay/&lt;/ref&gt;

John Davinier was in real life a French manservant at Kenwood, not an English apprentice lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/18/amma-asante-belle-bicultural-ghanaian-british-director-grange-hill&lt;/ref&gt; 

James Walvin OBE, professor emeritus of the University of York, said of ''Belle'': "Much of the historical evidence is there – though festooned in the film with imaginary relishes and fictional tricks. Partly accurate, the whole thing reminded me of the classic [[Morecambe and Wise]] sketch with Andre Previn (Eric bashing away on the piano): all the right notes – but not necessarily in the right order."&lt;ref name=HistoryExtra&gt;{{cite web|title=Historian at the Movies: Belle reviewed|url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/international-history/historian-movies-belle-reviewed|date=2 July 2014|website=History Extra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the film for ''History Extra'', the official website of ''BBC History Magazine'', Walvin noted that while the second half of the film centres on Dido Elizabeth Belle's involvement in the ''Zong'' case, in reality she was "nowhere to be found in the ''Zong'' affair".&lt;ref name=HistoryExtra /&gt; In the film "Tom Wilkinson’s Mansfield finds his cold legal commercial heart softened, and edged towards abolition by the eyelash-fluttering efforts of his stunning great niece" and his "adjudication becomes, not a point of law, but the first bold assertion towards the end of slavery". Walvin points out that "he merely stated that there should be another hearing of the ''Zong'' case – this time with evidence not known at the earlier hearing". Walvin awarded the film one star for enjoyment and two for historical accuracy.

Some press coverage ahead of filming, cited [[Amma Asante]] as the sole writer of ''Belle'', as well as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/belle-amma-asante-penelope-wilton-tom-felton-368382 |title=Penelope Wilton and Tom Felton Join Cast of Amma Asante's 'Belle' |work=The Hollywood Reporter|date= 7 September 2012|accessdate=1 July 2013|first=Stuart |last=Kemp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Press releases that followed [[Fox Searchlight]]'s acquisition of the film, gave the final credit determined by the [[Writers Guild of America, West]] as "Written by Misan Sagay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Cameron |last=Cook |url=http://www.foxsearchlight.com/post/3763/exclusive-belle-gallery-at-usa-today/ |title=Exclusive BELLE gallery at USA Today |publisher=Fox Searchlight |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosser |first=Michael |url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/fox-searchlight-acquires-belle/5057909.article/ |title=Fox Searchlight acquires Belle |publisher=Screendaily.com |date=1 July 2013 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Baz Bamigboye]] of ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' wrote that cast members [[Tom Wilkinson]] and [[Penelope Wilton]] had expressed "incredulity" at the accreditation decision, because Wilkinson and Wilton had "only seen and worked from a script written by Amma", whose writing and direction of her debut film won her the [[Carl Foreman]] award at the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTAs]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="dailymail-dispute"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bamigboye |first=Baz |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2426045/BAZ-BAMIGBOYE-Im-going-fired--Cate-Blanchett-spent-week-thinking-going-axed-Woody-Allen.html |title=Ouch!

The subsequent arbitration process undertaken by the Writers Guild of America, determined that Sagay provided the bulk of content used in the script, so Sagay was awarded sole writing credit. Producer [[Damian Jones]] confirmed, "There was a WGA arbitration. The WGA made its decision on writing credits. And the production respects and abides by their decision."&lt;ref name="dailymail-dispute" /&gt; Asante appealed but lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2014/05/understanding-screenwriting-credit-and-wga-arbitration-in-belle-and-12-years-a-slave-235814/|title=Understanding Screenwriting Credit and WGA Arbitration in ‘Belle’ and ’12 Years A Slave’|last=Mumin|first=Nijla|date=2014-05-19|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11008121/Belle-authors-in-bitter-feud-over-writing-credit.html|title=Belle authors in bitter feud over writing credit|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a "Certified Fresh" score of 83% based on reviews from 127 critics, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's consensus states, "It boasts all the surface beauty that fans of period pictures have come to expect, but ''Belle'' also benefits from its stirring performances and subtle social consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/belle_2014/ | title =Belle (2014) | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Flixster]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Mark Kermode]] named it his fourth-favourite film of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCWtjAN5cVo | title =My Top Ten Films of 2014 - Part 2 | work = Kermode Uncut | publisher = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8617">[[File:Jonson 1616 folio Workes title page.jpg|180px|thumb|Title page of ''The Workes of Beniamin Ionson'' (1616), the first folio publication that included stage plays.]]

The '''folio collections of [[Ben Jonson]]'s works''' published in the seventeenth century were crucial developments in the publication of English literature and English Renaissance drama. The first folio collection, issued in [[1616 in literature|1616]],&lt;ref&gt;Brady and Herendeen, pp. 11–22 and ff.&lt;/ref&gt; treated stage plays as serious works of literature instead of popular ephemera—at the time, a controversial position. The 1616 folio stood as a precedent for other play collections that followed—most notably the [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays in [[1623 in literature|1623]], but also the first [[Beaumont and Fletcher]] folio of [[1647 in literature|1647]], and other collections that were important in preserving the dramatic literature of the age for subsequent generations.

==The first folio, 1616==
The first Jonson folio of 1616, printed and published by [[William Stansby]] and sold through bookseller [[Richard Meighen]],&lt;ref&gt;When printers like Stansby acted as publishers, they usually had to arrange with one or more booksellers to sell their books—as, for one example, [[Thomas Creede]] sold his books through [[William Barley]].&lt;/ref&gt; contained nine plays, all previously published, plus two works of non-dramatic poetry, thirteen [[masques]], and six "entertainments."

*Plays:
** ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]''
** ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]''
** ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]''
** ''[[The Poetaster]]''
** ''[[Sejanus: His Fall]]''
** ''[[Volpone]]''
** ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman]]''
** ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''
** ''[[Catiline: His Conspiracy]]''
* Poetry:
** ''Epigrams''
** ''The Forest''
* Masques:
** ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]''
** ''[[The Masque of Beauty]]''
** ''[[Hymenaei]]''
** ''[[The Hue and Cry After Cupid]]''
** ''[[The Masque of Queens]]''
** ''[[The Speeches at Prince Henry's Barriers]]''
** ''[[Oberon, the Faery Prince]]''
** ''[[Love Freed from Ignorance and Folly]]''
** ''[[Love Restored]]''
** ''A Challenge at Tilt, at a Marriage''
** ''The Irish Masque at Court''
** ''[[Mercury Vindicated from the Alchemists]]''
** ''[[The Golden Age Restored]]''
* Entertainments:
** ''[[The Coronation Triumph|The King's Entertainment in Passing to His Coronation]]'' [''The Coronation Triumph'']
** ''A Panegyre, on the Happy Entrance of James''
** ''[[The Entertainment at Althorp|A Particular Entertainment of the Queen and Prince (at Althorp)]]'' [''The Satyr'']
** ''A Private Entertainment of the King and Queen (on May-Day)'' [''The Penates'']
** ''The Entertainment of the Two Kings (of Great Britain and Denmark)'' [''The Hours'']
** ''An Entertainment of King James and Queen Anne''

The first five of the masques, from ''Blackness'' through ''Queens'', had been printed previously, as had three of the entertainments, the ''Panegyre'', and the ''Epigrams''.

==The abortive 1631 addition==
In [[1631 in literature|1631]] Jonson planned a second volume to be added to the 1616 folio, a collection of later-written works to be published by [[Robert Allot]].&lt;ref&gt;Allot was a member of the syndicate of booksellers who published the Shakespeare [[Second Folio]] in [[1632 in literature|1632]].&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson, however, became dissatisfied with the quality of the printing (by John Beale), and cancelled the project. Three plays were set into type for the projected collection, and printings of those typecasts were circulated—though whether they were sold commercially or distributed privately by Jonson is unclear. The three plays are:
* ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]''
* ''[[The Devil Is an Ass]]''
* ''[[The Staple of News]]''

Allot died in 1635; in the 1637&amp;ndash;39 period, the rights to Jonson's works were involved in a complex legal dispute between [[Philip Chetwinde]], the second husband of Allot's widow, and stationers [[Andrew Crooke and William Cooke|Andrew Crooke]] and John Legatt, who believed they owned the rights to the works.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp. 75-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The second folio, 1640/1==
Two folio collections of Jonsonian works were issued in 1640-41. The first, printed by Richard Bishop for Andrew Crooke, was a 1640 reprint of the 1616 folio with corrections and emendations; it has sometimes been termed "the second edition of the first folio." The second volume was edited by Jonson's literary executor Sir [[Kenelm Digby]], and published by [[Richard Meighen]],&lt;ref&gt;Meighen, like Allot, was a member of the Shakespeare Second Folio syndicate.&lt;/ref&gt; in co-operation with Chetwinde. That volume contained later works, most of them unpublished or uncollected previously—six plays (including the three printed in 1631), two of them incomplete, and fifteen masques, plus miscellaneous pieces. In the Digby/Meighen volume—identified on its title page as "the Second Volume" of Jonson's works—the varying dates (1631, 1640, 1641) in some of the texts, and what editor William Savage Johnson once called "irregularity in contents and arrangement in different copies," have caused significant confusion.

* Plays:
** ''[[Bartholomew Fair]]''
** ''[[The Devil Is an Ass]]''
** ''[[The Magnetic Lady]]''
** ''[[A Tale of a Tub (play)|A Tale of a Tub]]''
** ''The Sad Shepherd'' (unfinished)
** ''Mortimer: His Fall'' (fragment)
* Masques:
** ''[[Christmas, His Masque]]''
** ''[[Lovers Made Men|A Masque Presented in the House of Lord Hay]]''
** ''[[The Vision of Delight]]''
** ''[[Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue]]''
** ''For the Honour of Wales''
** ''[[News from the New World Discovered in the Moon]]''
** ''[[The Gypsies Metamorphosed|A Masque of the Metamorphos'd Gypsies]]''
** ''[[The Masque of Augurs]]''
** ''[[Time Vindicated to Himself and to His Honours]]''
** ''[[Neptune's Triumph for the Return of Albion]]''
** ''[[Pan's Anniversary|Pan's Anniversary, or The Shepherd's Holiday]]''
** ''The Masque of Owls''
** ''[[The Fortunate Isles, and Their Union]]''
** ''[[Love's Triumph Through Callipolis]]''
** ''[[Chloridia|Chloridia: Rites to Chloris and Her Nymphs]]''
** ''[[The King's Entertainment at Welbeck]]''
** ''[[Love's Welcome at Bolsover]]''
* Miscellaneous:
** ''Underwoods''
** ''Horace, His Art of Poetry''
** ''The English Grammar''
** ''Timber, or Discoveries''

==The third folio, 1692==
The [[1692 in literature|1692]] single-volume third folio was printed by Thomas Hodgkin and published by a syndicate of booksellers—the title page lists [[Henry Herringman|H. Herringman]], E. Brewster, T. Bassett, R. Chiswell, M. Wotton, and G. Converse.&lt;ref&gt;Herringman, Brewster, and Chiswell were members of the four-man syndicate that published the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Fourth Folio]] of Shakespeare's plays in [[1685 in literature|1685]]. Herringman was one of three stationers who issued the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|second Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] in [[1679 in literature|1679]].&lt;/ref&gt; The third folio added two works to the previous total: the play ''[[The New Inn]],'' and ''Leges Convivales''.

Two other works by Jonson were left out of the 17th-century folios but added to later editions: the plays ''[[The Case is Altered]]'' and ''[[Eastward Ho]]'' (the latter written with Marston and [[George Chapman]]).

{{Other people}}
'''Catherine Blake''' (née '''Boucher'''; 25 April 1762 – 18 October 1831) was the wife of the poet, painter and [[Engraving|engraver]] [[William Blake]], and a vital presence and assistant throughout his life.

==Life==
Catherine was born the daughter of a man of a market gardener{{clarification needed|date=February 2017}} in [[Battersea]], then just outside London on the other side of the [[River Thames]]. She met William here in 1781, during his brief visit to the area, while he was recovering from an emotional upset following the failure of an earlier relationship. Their courtship was brief. According to early biographers of Blake, Catherine immediately recognised him as her future husband and when she sympathised with him over his earlier emotional troubles he replied "do you pity me? Then I love you."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wright, ''Life of William Blake'', Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Blake married Catherine &amp;ndash; who was five years his junior &amp;ndash; on 18 August 1782 in [[St. Mary's Church, Battersea]]. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an 'X'.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/William_Blake/11.R.htm Catherine Blake, ca.1805]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 5 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They remained together until his death in 1827.&lt;ref name="M155"&gt;Myrone, 155&lt;/ref&gt; Blake taught her to read and write, and also to use his [[printing-press]].

The couple did not have children, and it has been suggested that Blake wanted to bring a concubine into the relationship to act as a surrogate mother, which was consistent with the theories of [[Swedenborgianism]] by which Blake was influenced.&lt;ref name = "rob"&gt;Robert Rix, ''William Blake and the Cultures of Radical Christianity'', Ashgate, 2007, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Blake's earliest biographer [[Alexander Gilchrist]] does not mention this, but speaks of unspecified troubles in the early years of the relationship. However, [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] later explicitly asserted that this was the case, but that Blake dropped the idea when he saw that it upset Catherine. No documentary evidence survives supporting this notion, but Blake is known to have stated that he "learned from the Bible that wives should be held in common."&lt;ref name = "rob"/&gt;
[[File:The Letters of William Blake (1906) Kate's portrait.png|thumb|200px|Pencil drawing by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] after Tatham's life sketch of Catherine Blake]]&lt;!-- another poor reproduction at File:The Letters of William Blake- Catherine Blake.png --&gt;
Writers who knew the couple in their later years describe a very happy relationship. In 1802, [[William Hayley]] wrote that William "and his excellent wife (a true helpmate!) pass the plates thro' a rolling press in their own cottage together".&lt;ref name="M155" /&gt; On his deathbed, Blake drew a picture of Catherine as his last work, stating "you have ever been an angel to me".

After her husband's death Catherine was taken in by Blake's admirer [[Frederick Tatham]], for whom she nominally worked as a housekeeper. At this period she continued to sell Blake's works. When she died four years later Tatham claimed that she had bequeathed all Blake's works to him. When he later converted to [[Irvingite]] beliefs, he destroyed a number of them, asserting that they were inspired by the devil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Ackroyd]], ''William Blake'', pp. 368–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Blake's art==
Throughout her husband's uneven career, Catherine not only took an active role in the production of William's engravings and illuminated books; she also ran the household finances and offered strong practical support. William's friend [[John Thomas Smith (1766–1833)|J. T. Smith]] said that Blake "allowed her, to the last moment of his practice, to take off his proof impressions and print his works, which she did most carefully."&lt;ref name="M155" /&gt; Catherine's role in colouring at least some of William's illuminated books has been wide, although her hand is usually attributed to some of the more clumsily rendered passages. Her work as a printer is held in higher regard.&lt;ref name="M155" /&gt;

==Role in literature==
It has often been suggested that the figure of [[Enitharmon]] in Blake's mythology is partly inspired by Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila A. Spector, ''Glorious Incomprehensible: The Development of Blake's Kabbalistic Language'', Bucknell University Press, 2001, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Enitharmon is the wife of the "eternal prophet" [[Los (Blake)|Los]] in Blake's writings. Catherine is explicitly identified as the poet's "shadow of delight" in the second part of Blake's ''[[Milton a Poem]]''.

Catherine appears as a model wife in William Hayley's writings on ideal marriages. In more recent literature, she is the central character in [[Janet Adele Warner]]'s novel ''Other Sorrows, Other Joys: The Marriage of Catherine Sophia Boucher and William Blake'' (2001) and also features in [[Tracy Chevalier]]'s novel ''Burning Bright'' (2007). She is an amateur detective in short stories by [[Keith Heller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hycyber.com/MYST/EQ_ha.html|title=hycyber.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Shepherd (actor)|Jack Shepherd]]'s stage play ''In Lambeth'' dramatised a visit by [[Thomas Paine]] to the [[Lambeth]] home of William and Catherine Blake in 1789. It was first performed at the East Dulwich Tavern in July 1989. The play was later adapted for television in the [[BBC Two]] ''Encounters'' series (which featured similar fictionalised meetings between historical figures) and was first broadcast on 4 July 1993. It was directed by Sebastian Graham-Jones, and featured [[Mark Rylance]] as William, [[Bob Peck]] as Paine and Lesley Clare O'Neill as Catherine.

{{For|the album by Tony MacAlpine|Chromaticity (album)}}

[[File:PlanckianLocus.png|right|thumb|250px|The [[CIE 1931]] xy chromaticity space, also showing the chromaticities of black-body light sources of various temperatures, and lines of constant [[Color temperature#Correlated color temperature|correlated color temperature]]]]

'''Chromaticity''' is an objective specification of the quality of a [[color]] regardless of its [[luminance]]. Chromaticity consists of two [[dimension (mathematics and physics)|independent parameters]], often specified as [[hue]] (h) and [[colorfulness]] (s), where the latter is alternatively called saturation, chroma, intensity,&lt;ref&gt;In modern terminology the word "intensity" may refer to lightness, not to colorfulness.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[excitation purity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Progress in Optics | author = Emil Wolf | publisher = North Holland Pub. Co | year = 1961 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5n7yXmBusL0C&amp;q=chromaticity+hue+purity&amp;dq=chromaticity+hue+purity&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography | author = Leslie D. Stroebel, Richard D. Zakia | publisher = Focal Press | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-240-51417-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CU7-2ZLGFpYC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=chromaticity+hue+saturation+chroma+colorfulness+purity}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number of parameters follows from [[trichromacy]] of vision of most humans, which is assumed by most models in [[color science]].

==Quantitative description==
In color science, the [[white point]] of an illuminant or of a display is a neutral reference characterized by a chromaticity; all other chromaticities may be defined in relation to this reference using [[polar coordinates]]. The ''hue'' is the angular component, and the ''purity'' is the radial component, normalized{{clarify|date=June 2013|reason=note that the chromaticity space does not have a canonical affine structure, so there are no invariantly defined ratios of lengths even along the same line}} by the maximum radius for that hue.

Purity is roughly equivalent to the term "[[saturation (color theory)|saturation]]" in the [[HSV color space|HSV color model]]. The property "[[hue]]" is as used in general color theory and in specific [[color model]]s such as [[HSV and HSL]] color spaces, though it is more [[Color difference#Tolerance|perceptually uniform]] in color models such as [[Munsell color system|Munsell]], [[CIELAB]] or [[CIECAM02]].

Some [[color space]]s separate the three dimensions of color into one [[luminance (relative)|luminance]] dimension and a pair of chromaticity dimensions. For example, the white point of an [[sRGB]] display is an {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}} chromaticity of (0.3127, 0.3290), where {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} coordinates are used in the xyY space.
{| align=left style="margin-right:1em; border:1px gray solid" width=480px
 | style="font-size:87%; padding:2px" |{{math|(''u′'', ''v′'')}}, the chromaticity in [[CIELUV]], is a fairly [[Color difference#Tolerance|perceptually uniform]] presentation of the chromaticity as (another than in CIE 1931) planar [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] shape. This presentation is a [[projective transformation]] of the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram above.
 | [[Image:CIE 1976 UCS.png|240px]]
 |}
These pairs determine a chromaticity as [[affine coordinates]] on a [[triangle]] in a [[two-dimensional space|2D-space]], which contains all possible chromaticities. These {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are used because of simplicity of expression in [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931]] (see below) and have no inherent advantage. Other [[coordinate system]]s on the same X-Y-Z triangle, or other [[color triangle]]s, can be used.

On the other hand, some color spaces such as [[RGB color space|RGB]] and [[CIE XYZ color space|XYZ]] do not separate out chromaticity, but chromaticity is defined by a [[projectivization|mapping that normalizes out intensity]], and its coordinates, such as {{mvar|r}} and {{mvar|g}} or {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, can be calculated through the [[division (mathematics)|division]] operation, such as {{math|1=''x'' =}}&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''X''|''X'' + ''Y'' + ''Z''}}, and so on.

The xyY space is a cross between the CIE XYZ and its normalized chromaticity coordinates xyz, such that the luminance Y is preserved and augmented with just the required two chromaticity dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces | author = Charles A.

'''''Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer''''' is an [[advertisement|announcement trailer]] for the 2011 video game ''[[Dead Island]]'', which was developed by [[Techland]] and published by [[Deep Silver]]. The story of the trailer follows a family who is attacked by a horde of zombies in a hotel. The trailer ends with the infected daughter, who has turned into a zombie, being thrown to her death from a hotel window. The trailer was produced by Glasgow-based Axis Animation, with music created by [[Giles Lamb]].

The trailer was designed to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. The trailer does not show any actual gameplay, instead telling a short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the helplessness of a family in a zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, the trailer sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a mixed reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone, however, it received criticism for lacking gameplay information and its depiction of a dead child. The trailer received multiple awards upon release.

After they have settled in a hotel, an unexpected [[zombie outbreak]] occurs.&lt;ref name="Kok"/&gt; The daughter is running away from the horde of zombies in the hotel's corridor and dashing towards her room, where her father and mother are staying, when she is caught. A zombie bites the daughter's legs, causing her to become infected with the zombie virus.

The father opens the door and picks up a [[fire axe]] to fight against zombies. He rescues his daughter and brings her inside the hotel room. After placing the injured daughter on a bed, the couple begin fighting the zombies who are breaking into the room. The zombies overwhelm them, and the daughter turns into a zombie and attacks her father, biting him on the neck.  To defend himself, the father struggles, trying to push her off, until he throws her out of the window, breaking the glass. The daughter dies on impact with the ground. While the father is struggling, the mother is attacked and eaten by several zombies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg|title=Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 16, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corpses of the couple can be seen in a hotel room in the beginning of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5837416/the-final-moments-of-that-heartbreaking-dead-island-family-discovered-in-the-game|title=The Final Moments of That Heartbreaking Dead Island Family Discovered in the Game|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=September 6, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''[[Dead Island]]'', originally announced in 2007 by Techland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/08/dead-island-details-rescued|title=Dead Island Details Rescued|first=Daemon|last=Hatfield|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 8, 2007|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[survival horror]] video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, it was a game about killing zombies, not a game focused on delivering an emotional experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5775798/that-heartbreaking-dead-island-family-theyre-not-in-the-game|title=That Heartbreaking Dead Island Family? They're Not In The Game|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=April 3, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2011, Techland declined to give new information regarding the game as requested by the game's publisher, [[Deep Silver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/coj-dev-still-working-on-dead-island|title=COJ dev still working on Dead Island |first=Ellie|last=Gibson|date=June 7, 2009|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the lack of new information surrounding the game, many critics believed that the game had been quietly cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/dead-island-trailer-shows-the-worst-vacation-ever/|title=Dead Island Trailer Shows The Worst Vacation Ever|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=February 16, 2011|first=Ryan|last=Fleming|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on February 16, 2011, approximately four years after the game's initial announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/02/16/welcome-to-dead-island|title=Welcome to Dead Island|first=Ryan|last=Geddes|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 16, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer was produced and made by the [[Glasgow]]-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for ''[[Killzone 2]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/dead-island-trailer-creators-revealed/0108748|title=Dead Island trailer creators revealed|first=Rob|last=Crossley|work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director and the director of the trailer, [[Deep Silver]] gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating the trailer, allowing them to create their own characters instead of using the in-game protagonists.&lt;ref name="Line"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/37118-dead-island/|title=Dead Island: The game behind the stunning trailer, developed by Axis Animation and Savalas, is finally ready for release|first=Henry|last=Northmore|work=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|date=August 25, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make the trailer feel [[non-linear]] and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room.&lt;ref name="G4TV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/710713/dead-island-the-making-of-an-amazing-video-game-trailer/|title=Dead Island: The Making Of An Amazing Video Game Trailer|first=Anthony|last=Hernandez|work=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]|date=February 22, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt;

The team hoped that despite the short duration of the trailer, audiences would understand the story and be connected with its characters. They decided that it would be easy for players to identify with a family and that a story involving parents and children could convey the message quickly.&lt;ref name="G4TV"/&gt; They intended to use the trailer to depict the background information of the game, presenting information regarding the "discovery" of the outbreak, its inevitability,&lt;ref name="Dev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/interview/how-we-made-the-gore-ballet-dead-island-trailer/0116981|title=How we made the 'gore ballet' Dead Island trailer|work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]|first=Rob|last=Crossley|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the helplessness of the family. The team had an internal debate on whether the trailer should show guns, ultimately deciding that doing so would distract from the primary goal of the story.&lt;ref name="G4TV"/&gt; The story originally had the mother turn into a zombie, but the team changed it to the daughter, as they considered her more vulnerable when facing a large group of zombies.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; The team was worried that the action and violence featured would seem excessive, and they decided to alleviate the problem by introducing non-chronological storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109577-Dead-Island-Publisher-Shares-Its-Trailer-Making-Secrets|title=Dead Island Publisher Shares Its Trailer-Making Secrets|first=Logan|last=Westbrook|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=April 29, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver also proposed to mitigate the violence by having the trailer presented in [[slow motion]], as they believed that it could make the action feel "balletic" instead of purely violent.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt;

The trailer is made up of [[computer imagery]], and it does not show any actual gameplay footage of ''Dead Island''.&lt;ref name="Line"/&gt; The team hoped to use the trailer as a piece of "artwork", stating influence from the ''Carousel'' trailer from [[Philips]].&lt;ref name="Escapist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_303/8817-The-Ballet-of-Death|first=Robert|last=Rath|title=Rise From Your Grave: The Ballet Of Death|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer was also designed to showcase "great zombie moments" in an effort to attract the genre's supporters.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; The actual game development team used the trailer to build up the mood and atmosphere for the game, and they designed quests which required players to help people who had lost their families. They hoped that the mood would make players feel that they were the only hope existing on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/07/paradise-lost-how-dead-island-hopes-to-live-up-to-emotional-trailer/|title=How Dead Island hopes to live up to emotional trailer|first=Andrew|last=Webster|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=July 15, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer's music was composed by [[Giles Lamb]], who worked for a soundtrack development company called Savalas.&lt;ref name="Line"/&gt; The music was designed to be "somber", "melancholy", and "elegant",&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; in contrast with the gore presented in the trailer.&lt;ref name="Line"/&gt; The music was designed to be tense when the trailer is depicting violent action, and beautiful during peaceful moments. The team hoped that the music would create a "juxtaposition between beauty and horror".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/02/25/dead-island-cinematic-designer-responds-to-mixed-trailer-reactions.aspx|title=Dead Island Cinematic Designer Responds To Mixed Trailer Reactions|first=Annette|last=Gonzalez|date=February 25, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular reaction to the trailer led Techland to slightly adjust the game's tone, gameplay, and story, as well as the game's promotion strategy.&lt;ref name="Poly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2012/11/14/3537988/dead-island-the-reckoning|title=Dead Island: The Reckoning|first=Russ|last=Pitts|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=February 21, 2012|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="views"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/09/02/dead-island-release-trailer/|title=How a viral trailer set up Dead Island as a triple-A game release next week|first=Matthew|last=Lynley|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=September 2, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
A week after the release of the trailer, more than one million people had viewed it through [[YouTube]], exceeding Deep Silver's expectation of only 100,000 views.&lt;ref name="views"/&gt; ''Dead Island'' also became one of the most searched items on [[Google]], [[YouTube]], and [[Twitter]] for several days.&lt;ref name="views"/&gt; Axis was pleasantly surprised at the trailer's popularity.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; Following the trailer's release, ''Dead Island'' became a widely anticipated game.&lt;ref name="views"/&gt;

Many critics praised the trailer's use of reverse storytelling. Keith Stuart from ''[[The Guardian]]'' compared it favorably to [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]", saying that it successfully delivered an affecting and emotive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/17/dead-island-trailer-controversial|title=Dead Island: Will It Be The Most Controversial Trailer Ever Made|first=Keith|last=Sturat|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Fahey from ''[[Kotaku]]'' called the trailer's use of the dead girl "heartbreaking" and thought that it would be amazing if Techland was able to incorporate these emotional elements into the actual game.&lt;ref name="Kok"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5762287/dead-island-returns-and-a-little-girl-dies|title=The Most Heartbreaking Zombie Video Game Trailer You'll Ever See|first=Mike|last=Fahey|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=February 16, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its graphics and pacing also received commendation.&lt;ref name="Reception"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-problem-with-game-trailers/1100-6365663/|title=The Problem With Game Trailers|first=Laura|last= Parker |date=March 12, 2012|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer's story was praised for presenting an unconventional take on a zombie apocalypse.&lt;ref name="reception"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/09/dead-islands-trailer-was-amazing-appalling-and-enlightening/|title=Dead Island's Trailer Was Amazing, Appalling And Enlightening|first=Kirk|last=Hamilton|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=September 13, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Schreier from ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' said that the trailer had successfully made a saturated genre feel fresh again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/02/dead-island-trailer/|title=Don't Get Caught Up In Dead Island Trailer Hype|first=Jason|last=Schreier|work=[[Wired.co.uk]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer generated controversy around the depiction of the daughter's death. Fahey said that such elements are something video games usually "shy away from", yet it is presented as a main focus in the trailer.&lt;ref name="Kok"/&gt; Ben Parfitt from ''[[Market for Home Computing and Video Games]]'' found it offensive and thought that the team had stepped across the mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/opinion-that-dead-island-trailer/04843|title=OPINION: That Dead Island trailer|first=Ben|last=Parfitt|work=[[Market for Home Computing and Video Games]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending the trailer, Axis said that their depiction fit the overarching narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/dead-island-trailer-creator-speaks-to-dead-girl-controversy/|title=Dead Island trailer creator speaks to dead girl controversy|first=Matt|last=Bradford|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Rath from ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' also liked the segment, calling it "deliberate and necessary", and thought that the overall effect would have been significantly hampered if had been removed from the trailer.&lt;ref name="Escapist"/&gt;

The lack of gameplay information was also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer disconnected from the actual game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, and with the game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer.&lt;ref name="Reception"/&gt; Daemon Hatfield from [[IGN]] similarly thought that the trailer was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game would not be as entertaining and interesting as the trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/04/gdc-is-dead-island-anything-like-its-debut-trailer|title=GDC: Is Dead Island Anything Like Its Debut Trailer|first=Daemon|last=Hatfield|work=[[IGN]]|date=March 3, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, many reviewers thought that the trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations.&lt;ref name="reception"/&gt;

The trailer was given a gold award at the [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/06/29/dead-island-trailer-wins-gold-award-at-cannes-advertising-fe/|title=Dead Island trailer wins Gold award at Cannes ... advertising festival|first=Christopher|last=Grant|work=[[Joystiq]]|date=June 29, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named by gaming journalists as one of the best video game trailers ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/features/article/ten_of_the_best_cgi_game_trailers.html|title=Ten of the Best CGI Game Trailers|work=VideoGamer.com|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-best-game-trailers-of-the-generation-1462534128|title=The Best Game Trailers Of The Generation|first=Kirk|last=Hamilton|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/11/the-14-best-game-trailers-of-2014|title=The 14 Best Game Trailers Of 2014|first=Marty|last=Silva|work=[[IGN]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
A live-action remake and a recut version of the trailer which shows the story in a chronological order were released by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/3/5061620/dead-island-trailer-live-action-remake|title=Watch the gloriously gory 'Dead Island' trailer re-enacted in live action|first=Vlad|last=Savov  |date=November 3, 2013|accessdate=October 25, 2015|work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/02/17/dead-island-trailer-re-cut-in-chronological-order.aspx|title=Dead Island Trailer Re-Cut In Chronological Order|first=Matt|last=Helgeson|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015|work=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement trailer also boosted the popularity of Techland and Deep Silver.&lt;ref name="Poly"/&gt; The announcement trailer for ''[[Dead Island: Riptide]]'', released in 2012, featured a similar, depressing tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dead_island_riptide/b/xbox360/archive/2012/09/18/another-gorgeous-depressing-cg-trailer.aspx|title=Dead Island Riptide: Another Gorgeous, Depressing CG Trailer|first=Tim|last=Turi|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=September 18, 2012|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trailer for ''[[Goat Simulator]]'' in 2014 also mimicked the format of the ''Dead Island'' announcement trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/goat-simulator-pulls-a-dead-island-for-its-emotional-launch-trailer-272493.phtml|title=Goat Simulator pulls a Dead Island for its emotional launch trailer|first=Jordan|last=Devore|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=March 26, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A movie tie-in based on the trailer was once proposed by [[Lionsgate]], though the project was ultimately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/1/5960827/dead-island-movie-deep-silver|title=Hollywood taking a second stab at a Dead Island movie|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 1, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver released a musical tribute to the trailer, coinciding with the launch of ''[[Dead Island: Definitive Edition]]'' in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/heres-a-musical-tribute-to-the-dead-island-trailer-in-case-you-wanted-to-cry-today/?|title=Here's a musical tribute to the Dead Island trailer, in case you wanted to cry today|first=Sam|last=Prett|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=May 31, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deccani painting''' is a Deccan form of miniature painting, evolved in [[South India|south]]-[[Western India|western]] [[India]]—(also known as [[Deccan]]), during the inception of [[Bahmani Sultanate]] in 1347 AD. The style developed under the patronage of [[Deccan sultanates]]—( namely, [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], [[Golconda Sultanate|Golkonda]], [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Ahmadnagar]], [[Bidar Sultanate|Bidar]], and [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]] ) and lasted until the extinct of the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] in 1687 AD.&lt;ref name="HIA"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Indian Art|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=2VJADAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=deccani+painting+history&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|last=Kanjilal|first=Kajal|isbn=9789351991182|year=1983|pages=58–59|publisher=Saraswati House Pvt Ltd|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaitanya"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Painting: The modern period|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=McSbSMhArFgC&amp;dq|last=Chaitanya|first=Krishna|isbn=9788170173106|year=1976|page=31|publisher=Abhinav Publications|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark"&gt;{{cite book|title=Deccani Painting|last=Zebrowski|first=Mark|isbn=9780520048782|year=1983|publisher=Sotheby Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While [[Mughal painting]] was developing under [[Akbar]], in the second half of the 16th century, the art form was evolving independently in the Deccan sultanates. The miniature painting style, which flourished initially in the Bahmani court of Bahmani Sultanate and later in the courts of Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, Bidar Berrar and Golkonda is popularly known as the Deccan school of Painting. One of the earliest surviving paintings are found as the illustrations of a manuscript ''[[Tarif-i-Hussain Shahi]]'' (1565 AD), which is now in [[Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal]], [[Pune]]. About 400 miniature paintings are found in the manuscript of [[Nujum-ul-Ulum]] (Stars of Science) (1570), kept in [[Chester Beatty Library]], [[Dublin]].

==Style==

The style of Deccani painting flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries, Passing through multiple phases of sudden maturation and prolonged stagnation, later in the 18th and 19th centuries after the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] conquest of Deccan the style gradually withered away and new form of Hyderabad style painting evolved in the Deccan region particularly in the [[Nizam]] terotary. Most of the colouring of Deccani paintings are Islamic [[Turkish painting|Turkish]] and [[Persian painting|Persian]] tradition specially the arabesques, but those are surmounted by a pure Deccani piece of foliage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9871">The '''Dialogue of Pessimism''' is an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n dialogue between a master and his servant that expresses the futility of human action. It has parallels with biblical [[wisdom literature]].

==Text and dating==
The Dialogue is a loosely poetic composition in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], written soon after 1000 BC in Mesopotamia. It was discovered in five different clay tablet manuscripts written in the [[cuneiform]] script. The text is well-preserved, with only 15 of its 86 lines being fragmentary.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro, 1992: 251f&lt;/ref&gt; Two textual versions seem to survive, as a [[Babylon]]ian tablet is substantially different from [[Assyria]]n versions.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, 143&lt;/ref&gt; Its likely Akkadian title was ''arad mitanguranni'', the repeated phrase at the beginning of every stanza.&lt;ref&gt;Speiser, 103f; Lambert, 144; Hurowitz, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and style==
The Dialogue of Pessimism takes the form of a dialogue between a master and his slave valet. In each of the first ten stanzas the master proposes a course of action, for which the slave provides good reasons. Each time, however, the master changes his mind and the slave provides equally good reasons for not pursuing that course of action. The courses of action are:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I. Driving to the palace
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
II. Dining
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
III. Hunting
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IV. Marriage (“building a house” in Speiser)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
V. Litigation (this is the most fragmentary stanza)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
VI. Leading a revolution (“commit a crime” in Speiser)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
VII. Sexual intercourse
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
VIII. Sacrifice
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IX. Making investments (“plant crops” in Speiser)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
X. Public service
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A sample of the Dialogue is (Master ''Slave''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Slave, listen to me! ''Here I am, master, here I am!''
&lt;br /&gt;I want to make love to a woman! ''Make love, master, make love!''
&lt;br /&gt;''The man who makes love forgets sorrow and fear!''
&lt;br /&gt;O well, slave, I do not want to make love to a woman.
&lt;br /&gt;''Do not make love, master, do not make love.''
&lt;br /&gt;''Woman is a real pitfall, a hole, a ditch,''
&lt;br /&gt;''Woman is a sharp iron dagger that cuts a man’s throat.''
&lt;br /&gt;(Stanza VII, lines 46–52) &lt;ref&gt;Translations from Bottéro, 253–257, after Lambert. Another translation is given in Speiser, who provides extensive annotations on text and translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stanza XI is substantially different:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Slave, listen to me! ''Here I am, master, here I am!''
&lt;br /&gt;What then is good?
&lt;br /&gt;To have my neck and yours broken,
&lt;br /&gt;or to be thrown into the river, is that good?
&lt;br /&gt;''Who is so tall as to ascend to heaven?''
&lt;br /&gt;''Who is so broad as to encompass the entire world?''
&lt;br /&gt;O well, slave! I will kill you and send you first!
&lt;br /&gt;''Yes, but my master would certainly not survive me for three days.'' &lt;ref&gt;A similar prediction is made in [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Quentin Durward]]'', where, in [http://www.online-literature.com/walter_scott/quentin-durward/29/ chapter 29], the astrologer secures his own safety by predicting to Louis XI that the king would die 24 hours after the astrologer’s own death.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;(Lines 79–86)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dialogue is limited to two people (unlike, for instance, [[Plato]]’s dialogues), as is common in ancient Middle-Eastern wisdom literature. In the scribal tradition of Mesopotamian literature, one learns by verbal instruction and reflective reading, not by debate.&lt;ref&gt;Denning-Bolle, 230&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that it may have been a dramatic text, performed publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Speiser, 105; Denning-Bolle, 232&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a set of abstract or universal principles to be applied to every situation, the slave employs concrete images and instances.&lt;ref&gt;Denning-Bolle, 226, 229; Bottéro observes several times that the Mesopotamian mind did not formulate abstract or universal principles but, rather, employed sometimes exhaustive lists of instances and examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialogue stands consciously in the continuum of Mesopotamian literature. Line 76 quotes a line at the beginning and the end of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]. Lines 86–87 quote an ancient [[Sumer|Sumerian]] saying.&lt;ref&gt;Speiser, 104f&lt;/ref&gt; Lines 62–69 may allude to a part of the Great Hymn to [[Shamash]] (lines 118–127).&lt;ref&gt;Hurowitz&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
The Dialogue falls into the philosophical area of [[theodicy]]. Interpretation of the Dialogue is divided. Some see it as a statement of life's absurdity, because there are no definitive right and wrong choices or reasons for action. The final stanza is therefore a logical outcome of this quandary, the choice of non-existence over existential futility.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, 139-142; Hartley, 353f&lt;/ref&gt; An opposing interpretation takes its cue from the slave's final cheeky retort, seeing the Dialogue as social satire, where the servile yet cheeky slave exposes the vacillation and unproductiveness of his aristocratic master through conflicting and clichéd answers.&lt;ref&gt;Speiser, 103–105&lt;/ref&gt; Religious satire is also present in comments about the behaviour of the gods.

Parallels with the second-millennium Mesopotamian text ''[[Ludlul bēl nēmeqi|Monologue of the Righteous Sufferer]]'' (also known as "I will praise the Lord of Wisdom") and the biblical [[Ecclesiastes|Book of Ecclesiastes]] suggest a third interpretation. The universe is indeed enigmatic and human actions seemingly meaningless, yet the gods hold the secrets of the universe (revealed in the slave's comment about heaven and earth in Stanza XI). Rather than suggesting death out of despair, the master wants the slave to enter before him into death so that he can ask the gods. The slave’s final satirical rejoinder parries his master's suggestion. The Dialogue's purpose is partly satirical and partly serious, and its end is to remind readers that the gods control the destinies, which are unknown to us.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro, 259–267&lt;/ref&gt; The wise man, like the slave, reserves judgement and assesses possibilities in the face of life’s ambiguities, albeit while retaining his sense of humour.&lt;ref&gt;Denning-Bolle, 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallels with the Old Testament==
There is a thematic parallel between the Dialogue of Pessimism and the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament. The affirmations and their negations given by the Dialogue's slave are similar to the list of actions and their opposites given in Ecclesiastes 3:1-9 ("a time to be born and a time to die..."). Ecclesiastes, like the Dialogue, has been the subject of pessimistic and optimistic interpretations, and is also amenable to the interpretation that the incomprehensibility of the universe and human life point to our limitations and the transcendent knowledge of God.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro, 260–262&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some parallels and contrasts with the [[Book of Job]]. Like the Dialogue, Job also considers death as an option in the face of life's contradictions (Job 3:2–13), although he never contemplates suicide. Moreover, Job does not conclude on a note of death: rather, that theme was more present at the outset. The use of irony and satire to probe life's mysteries also feature in both the Dialogue and Job (e.g. Job 9:39–31).&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, 353f&lt;/ref&gt;

A proverb appearing at the end of the dialogue, "who is so tall as to ascend to the heavens? who is so broad as to encompass the entire world?" has several biblical parallels, among which are the opening verse of the proverbs of Agur (Proverbs 30:1); Deuteronomy 30:11-14; Job 11:7-9; and Job 28:12-18.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, 430; Samet 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drama''' is the specific [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of [[fiction]] [[Mimesis|represented]] in [[performance]]: a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[mime]], [[ballet]], etc, performed in a [[theatre]], or on [[Radio drama|radio]] or television.&lt;ref name="elam98"&gt;Elam (1980, 98).&lt;/ref&gt; Considered as a genre of [[poetry]] in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and the [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] modes ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of [[dramatic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Fergusson]] writes that "a drama, as distinguished from a [[Lyric poetry|lyric]], is not primarily a composition in the verbal medium; the [[Dialogue (fiction)|words]] result, as one might put it, from the underlying [[Dramatic structure|structure of incident]] and [[Character (arts)|character]]. As [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]] remarks, 'the poet, or "maker" should be the maker of [[Plot (narrative)|plots]] rather than of verses; since he is a poet because he [[Mimesis|imiates]], and what he imitates are [[Action (philosophy)|actions]]'" (1949, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The term "drama" comes from a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "[[Action (philosophy)|action]]" ([[Classical Greek]]: {{lang|grc|δρᾶμα}}, ''drama''), which is derived from "I do" ([[Classical Greek]]: {{lang|grc|δράω}}, ''drao''). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional [[Genre|generic]] division between [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. 

In English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages), the word "[[Play (theatre)|play]]" or "game" (translating the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''pleġan'' or [[Latin]] ''ludus'') was the standard term used to describe drama until [[William Shakespeare]]'s time—just as its creator was a "play-maker" rather than a "dramatist" and the building was a "play-house" rather than a "[[Theater (building)|theatre]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wickham (1959, 32—41; 1969, 133; 1981, 68—69). The sense of the creator of plays as a "maker" rather than a "writer" is preserved in the word "[[playwright]]." [[The Theatre]], one of the first purpose-built playhouses in London, was "a self-conscious latinism to describe one particular playhouse" rather than a term for the buildings in general (1967, 133). The word 'dramatist' "was at that time still unknown in the English language" (1981, 68).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The use of "drama" in a more narrow sense to designate a specific ''type'' of [[play (theatre)|play]] dates from the modern era. "Drama" in this sense refers to a play that is ''neither'' a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, [[Émile Zola|Zola's]] ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' ([[1873 in literature|1873]]) or [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov's]] ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' ([[1887 in literature|1887]]). It is this narrower sense that the [[film]] and [[television]] industries, along with [[film studies]], adopted to describe "[[Drama (film and television)|drama]]" as a [[Film genre|genre]] within their respective media. "[[Radio drama]]" has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance, it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of [[radio]].&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 894–900).&lt;/ref&gt;

The enactment of drama in [[theatre]], performed by [[actor]]s on a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] before an [[audience]], presupposes [[Collaboration|collaborative]] modes of production and a [[collective]] form of reception. The [[Dramatic structure|structure of dramatic texts]], unlike other forms of [[literature]], is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.&lt;ref&gt;Pfister (1977, 11).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mime is a form of drama where the action of a story is told only through the movement of the body. Drama can be combined with [[music]]: the dramatic text in [[opera]] is generally sung throughout; as for in some ballets dance "expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [https://www.britannica.com/art/dance/Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Musical theatre|Musicals]] include both spoken [[dialogue]] and [[song]]s; and some forms of drama have [[incidental music]] or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue ([[melodrama]] and Japanese [[Noh|Nō]], for example).&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;See the entries for "opera", "musical theatre, American", "melodrama" and "Nō" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Closet drama]] describes a form that is intended to be read, rather than performed.&lt;ref name="closet"&gt;''[[Manfred]]'' by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], for example, is a good example of a "[[Verse drama and dramatic verse|dramatic poem]]." See the entry on "Byron (George George)" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Improvisational theatre|improvisation]], the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.&lt;ref name="impro"&gt;Some forms of improvisation, notably the [[Commedia dell'arte]], improvise on the basis of 'lazzi' or rough outlines of scenic action (see Gordon (1983) and Duchartre (1929)). All forms of improvisation take their cue from their immediate response to one another, their characters' situations (which are sometimes established in advance), and, often, their interaction with the audience. The classic formulations of improvisation in the theatre originated with [[Joan Littlewood]] and [[Keith Johnstone]] in the UK and [[Viola Spolin]] in the USA; see Johnstone (1981) and Spolin (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Greek drama===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Greece}}
[[File:Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks - Princeton Art Museum.jpg|thumb|right|''Relief of a seated poet ([[Menander]]) with masks of New Comedy'', 1st century BC – early 1st century AD, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]
[[Western culture|Western]] drama originates in [[classical Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54), and Ley (2007, 206). Taxidou notes that "most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct" (2004, 104). Brown writes that [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek drama]] "was essentially the creation of [[classical Athens]]: all the dramatists who were later regarded as classics were active at Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the time of the [[Athenian democracy]]), and all the surviving plays date from this period" (1998, 441). "The dominant culture of [[Classical Athens|Athens in the fifth century]]", Goldhill writes, "can be said to have invented [[theatre]]" (1997, 54).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatrical culture]] of the [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] produced three [[genre]]s of drama: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]]. Their origins remain obscure, though by the 5th century BC they were [[institution]]alised in [[Agon|competitions]] held as part of [[Athenian festivals|festivities]] celebrating the god [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13–15) and Banham (1998, 441–447).&lt;/ref&gt; Historians know the names of many ancient Greek dramatists, not least [[Thespis]], who is credited with the innovation of an actor ("''hypokrites''") who speaks (rather than sings) and impersonates a [[Character (arts)|character]] (rather than speaking in his own person), while interacting with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] and its leader ("''[[coryphaeus]]''"), who were a traditional part of the performance of non-dramatic poetry ([[dithyramb]]ic, [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[Epic poetry|epic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 441–444). For more information on these ancient Greek dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Greek dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Greek dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a small fraction of the work of five dramatists, however, has survived to this day: we have a small number of complete texts by the tragedians [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], and the comic writers [[Aristophanes]] and, from the late 4th century, [[Menander]].&lt;ref&gt;The theory that ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' was not written by [[Aeschylus]] would bring this number to six dramatists whose work survives.&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus' historical tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'' is the oldest surviving drama, although when it won first prize at the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]] competition in 472 BC, he had been writing plays for more than 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 8) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–16).&lt;/ref&gt; The competition ("''[[agon]]''") for tragedies may have begun as early as 534 BC; official records ("''didaskaliai''") begin from 501 BC when the [[satyr play]] was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13, 15) and Banham (1998, 442).&lt;/ref&gt; Tragic dramatists were required to present a [[tetralogy]] of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play (though exceptions were made, as with Euripides' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'' in 438 BC). [[Comedy]] was officially recognized with a prize in the competition from 487 to 486 BC.

Five comic dramatists competed at the City [[Dionysia]] (though during the [[Peloponnesian War]] this may have been reduced to three), each offering a single comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 18) and Banham (1998, 444–445).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is traditionally divided between "old comedy" (5th century BC), "middle comedy" (4th century BC) and "new comedy" (late 4th century to 2nd BC).&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 444–445).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Roman drama===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Rome}}
[[File:Statuette actor Petit Palais ADUT00192.jpg|thumb|An ivory statuette of a Roman actor of [[tragedy]], 1st century CE.]]
Following the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BC) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BC, Rome encountered [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]].&lt;ref name="h43"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43).&lt;/ref&gt; From the later years of the republic and by means of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; [[Theater of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 36, 47).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43). For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 46–47).&lt;/ref&gt; The first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]] were the [[Tragedy|tragedies]] and [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] that [[Livius Andronicus]] wrote from 240 BC.&lt;ref name="h47"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]] also began to write drama.&lt;ref name="h47" /&gt; No plays from either writer have survived. While both dramatists composed in both [[genres]], Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies; their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama.&lt;ref name="h47" /&gt;

By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a [[guild]] of writers (''collegium poetarum'') had been formed.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47–48).&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman comedies that have survived are all ''[[fabula palliata]]'' (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: [[Plautus|Titus Maccius Plautus]] (Plautus) and [[Terence|Publius Terentius Afer]] (Terence).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48–49).&lt;/ref&gt; In re-working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] in dividing the drama into [[episode]]s and introduced musical accompaniment to its [[dialogue]] (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence).&lt;ref name="h49"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49).&lt;/ref&gt; The action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from [[eavesdropping]].&lt;ref name="h49" /&gt;

Plautus, the more popular of the two, wrote between 205 and 184 BC and twenty of his comedies survive, of which his [[farce]]s are best known; he was admired for the [[wit]] of his dialogue and his use of a variety of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meters]].&lt;ref name="h48"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48).&lt;/ref&gt; All of the six comedies that Terence wrote between 166 and 160 BC have survived; the complexity of his plots, in which he often combined several Greek originals, was sometimes denounced, but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour.&lt;ref name="h48" /&gt; No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians—[[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]], and [[Lucius Accius]].&lt;ref name="h49" /&gt;

From the time of the empire, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].&lt;ref name="h50"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 50).&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49–50).&lt;/ref&gt; Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.&lt;ref name="h50" /&gt;

[[File:Castle of Perseverance staging.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stage drawing from a 15th-century [[vernacular]] [[morality play]] ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' (as found in the [[Macro Manuscript]]).]]
Beginning in the [[early Middle Ages]], churches staged dramatised versions of biblical events, known as [[liturgical drama]]s, to enliven annual celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76, 78). Many churches would have only performed one or two [[liturgical drama]]s per year and a larger number never performed any at all.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest example is the [[Easter]] trope ''Whom do you Seek? (Quem-Quaeritis)'' (c. 925).&lt;ref name="Brockett_76"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76).&lt;/ref&gt; Two groups would sing responsively in [[Latin]], though no impersonation of [[Character (arts)|characters]] was involved. By the 11th century, it had spread through Europe to [[Russia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[Italy]]; excluding [[Al-Andalus|Islamic-era Spain]].

In the 10th century, [[Hrosvitha]] wrote six plays in Latin modeled on [[Terence]]'s comedies, but which treated religious subjects.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 77).&lt;/ref&gt; Her plays are the first known to be composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western drama of the post-Classical era.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"/&gt; Later, [[Hildegard of Bingen]] wrote a [[music]]al drama, ''Ordo Virtutum'' (c. 1155).&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"/&gt;

One of the most famous of the early [[Secularity|secular]] plays is the courtly [[pastoral]] ''[[Jeu de Robin et Marion|Robin and Marion]]'', written in the 13th century in French by [[Adam de la Halle]].&lt;ref&gt;Wickham (1981, 191; 1987, 141).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Interlude of the Student and the Girl]]'' (c. 1300), one of the earliest known in English, seems to be the closest in tone and form to the contemporaneous French [[farce]]s, such as ''[[The Boy and the Blind Man]].''&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 9, 11, 38, 45), Dillon (2006, 213), and Wickham (1976, 195; 1981, 189–190). In ''Early English Stages'' (1981), Wickham points to the existence of ''[[The Interlude of the Student and the Girl]]'' as evidence that the old-fashioned view that [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] began in England in the 1550s with ''[[Gammer Gurton's Needle]]'' and ''[[Ralph Roister Doister]]'' is mistaken, ignoring as it does a rich tradition of [[Medieval theatre|medieval comic drama]]; see Wickham (1981, 178).&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of plays survive from [[France]] and [[Germany]] in the [[late Middle Ages]], when some type of religious drama was performed in nearly every European country. Many of these plays contained [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s, and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt; In England, trade guilds began to perform [[vernacular]] "[[mystery plays]]," which were composed of long cycles of a large number of playlets or "pageants," of which four are [[Extant literature|extant]]: [[York Mystery Plays|York]] (48 plays), [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] (24), [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] (32) and the so-called "[[N-Town Plays|N-Town]]" (42). ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play]]'' from the Wakefield cycle is a farcical story of a stolen sheep that its [[protagonist]], Mak, tries to pass off as his new-born child asleep in a crib; it ends when the shepherds from whom he has stolen are summoned to the [[Nativity of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morality plays]] (a modern term) emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished in the early [[Elizabethan era]] in England. Characters were often used to represent different ethical ideals. ''[[Everyman]]'', for example, includes such figures as Good Deeds, Knowledge and Strength, and this characterisation reinforces the conflict between good and evil for the audience.  ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' (c. 1400—1425) depicts an archetypal figure's progress from birth through to death. ''[[Horestes]]'' (c. 1567), a late "hybrid morality" and one of the earliest examples of an English [[revenge play]], brings together the classical story of [[Orestes]] with a [[Vice (character)|Vice]] from the medieval [[Allegory|allegorical]] tradition, alternating comic, [[slapstick]] scenes with serious, [[Tragedy|tragic]] ones.&lt;ref&gt;Spivack (1958, 251-303), Bevington (1962, 58-61, 81-82, 87, 183), and Weimann (1978, 155).&lt;/ref&gt; Also important in this period were the folk dramas of the [[Mummers Play]], performed during the [[Christmas]] season. Court [[masque]]s were particularly popular during the reign of [[Henry VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 101-103).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabethan and Jacobean===
{{Main article|English Renaissance theatre}}
One of the great flowerings of drama in [[England]] occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries. Many of these plays were written in verse, particularly [[iambic pentameter]]. In addition to Shakespeare, such authors as [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Thomas Middleton]], and [[Ben Jonson]] were prominent playwrights during this period. As in the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], historical plays celebrated the lives of past kings, enhancing the image of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] monarchy. Authors of this period drew some of their storylines from [[Greek mythology]] and [[Roman mythology]] or from the plays of eminent Roman playwrights such as [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].

===English Restoration comedy===
{{Main article|Restoration comedy}}
[[File:Colley Cibber as Lord Foppington in The Relapse by John Vanbrugh engraving.jpg|thumb|[[Colley Cibber]] as the extravagant and affected Lord Foppington, "brutal, evil, and smart", in [[John Vanbrugh|Vanbrugh's]] ''[[The Relapse]]'' (1696).]]

[[Restoration comedy]] refers to English comedies written and performed in England during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710. [[Comedy of manners]] is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy.&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur [https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; After [[London theatre closure 1642|public theatre had been banned]] by the [[Puritan]] regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 with the Restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] signalled a renaissance of [[English drama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hatch|first1=Mary Jo|title=The Three Faces of Leadership: Manager, Artist, Priest|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration comedy is known for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness, urbane, cosmopolitan [[wit]], up-to-the-minute topical writing, and crowded and bustling plots. Its dramatists stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] plays, and even from [[Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Classics|classical]] comedies, combining the various plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized "variety" within as well as between plays. Restoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of the first professional female playwright, [[Aphra Behn]], in the 1680s is an important exception. In the mid-1690s, a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are significantly different from each other.

The unsentimental or "hard" comedies of [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]], and [[George Etherege]] reflected the atmosphere at Court and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic [[machismo|macho]] lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]] (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). The single play that does most to support the charge of [[obscenity]] levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's masterpiece ''[[The Country Wife]]'' (1675), whose title contains a [[Lascivious behavior|lewd]] [[pun]] and whose notorious "china scene" is a series of sustained [[double entendre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|ROI9FhR6URI|The "China scene" from Wycherley's play}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the "softer" comedies of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] and [[John Vanbrugh]] set out to appeal to more socially diverse audience with a strong middle-class element, as well as to female spectators. The comic focus shifts from young lovers outwitting the older generation to the vicissitudes of marital relations. In Congreve's ''[[Love for Love]]'' (1695) and ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700), the give-and-take set pieces of couples testing their attraction for one another have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the latter's famous "Proviso" scene. Vanbrugh's ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'' (1697) has a light touch and more humanly recognisable characters, while ''[[The Relapse]]'' (1696) has been admired for its throwaway wit and the characterisation of Lord Foppington, an extravagant and affected [[burlesque]] [[fop]] with a dark side.&lt;ref&gt;''The Provoked Wife'' is something of a Restoration [[problem play]] in its attention to the subordinate legal position of married women and the complexities of "divorce" and separation, issues that had been highlighted in the mid-1690s by some notorious cases before the [[House of Lords]].&lt;/ref&gt; The tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out by the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did.&lt;ref&gt;Interconnected causes for this shift in taste were [[demographic]] change, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, [[William III of England|William]]'s and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]'s dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]] (founded in 1692). When [[Jeremy Collier]] attacked Congreve and Vanbrugh in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'' in 1698, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place.&lt;/ref&gt; At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of ''The Way of the World'', Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by [[sentimental comedy]] and the drama of exemplary morality.

===Modern and postmodern===
The pivotal and innovative contributions of the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th-century]] Norwegian dramatist [[Henrik Ibsen]] and the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th-century]] German [[theatre practitioner]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] dominate modern drama; each inspired a tradition of imitators, which include many of the greatest playwrights of the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1993, 25–26) and Moi (2006, 17). Moi writes that "Ibsen is the most important playwright writing after Shakespeare. He is the founder of modern theater. His plays are world classics, staged on every continent, and studied in classrooms everywhere. In any given year, there are hundreds of Ibsen productions in the world." Ibsenites include [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Arthur Miller]]; Brechtians include [[Dario Fo]], [[Joan Littlewood]], [[W. H. Auden]] [[Peter Weiss]], [[Heiner Müller]], [[Peter Hacks]], [[Tony Kushner]], [[Caryl Churchill]], [[John Arden]], [[Howard Brenton]], [[Edward Bond]], and [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]].&lt;/ref&gt; The works of both playwrights are, in their different ways, both [[Modernism|modernist]] and [[Realism (theatre)|realist]], incorporating formal [[Experimental theatre|experimentation]], [[meta-theatre|meta-theatricality]], and [[Social criticism|social critique]].&lt;ref&gt;Moi (2006, 1, 23–26). Taxidou writes: "It is probably historically more accurate, although methodologically less satisfactory, to read the [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalist movement in the theatre]] in conjunction with the more anti-illusionist aesthetics of the theatres of the same period. These interlock and overlap in all sorts of complicated ways, even when they are vehemently denouncing each other (perhaps particularly when) in the favoured mode of the time, the manifesto" (2007, 58).&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the traditional theoretical discourse of genre, Ibsen's work has been described as the culmination of "[[Tragedy#Modern development|liberal tragedy]]", while Brecht's has been aligned with an [[Historicization|historicised]] comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1966) and Wright (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important playwrights of the modern era include Antonin Artaud, [[August Strindberg]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Ernst Toller]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Dario Fo]], [[Heiner Müller]], and [[Caryl Churchill]].

== Opera ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
[[Opera|Western opera]] is a dramatic art form that arose during the [[Renaissance]] in an attempt to revive the [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|classical Greek drama]] in which dialogue, dance, and song were combined. Being strongly intertwined with [[Classical music|western classical music]], the opera has undergone enormous changes in the past four centuries and it is an important form of theatre until this day. Noteworthy is the major influence of the German 19th-century composer [[Wagner|Richard Wagner]] on the opera tradition. In his view, there was no proper balance between music and theatre in the operas of his time, because the music seemed to be more important than the dramatic aspects in these works. To restore the connection with the classical drama, he entirely renewed the operatic form to emphasize the equal importance of music and drama in works that he called "[[music drama]]s".

[[Chinese opera]] has seen a more conservative development over a somewhat longer period of time.

== Pantomime ==
{{Main|Pantomime}}
[[Pantomime]] (informally '''panto'''),&lt;ref&gt;Lawner, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[musical theatre|musical comedy]] stage production, designed for family entertainment. It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom, generally during the Christmas and New Year season and, to a lesser extent, in other English-speaking countries. Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing, employs gender-crossing actors, and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or [[Folklore|folk tale]].&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid-Walsh, Jacqueline. "Pantomime", ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', Jack Zipes (ed.), Oxford University Press (2006), {{ISBN|9780195146561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer (1969), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.

These stories follow in the tradition of [[fable]]s and [[Folklore|folk tale]]s. Usually, there is a lesson learned, and with some help from the audience, the hero/heroine saves the day. This kind of play uses [[stock character]]s seen in masque and again [[commedia dell'arte]], these characters include the villain (doctore), the clown/servant (Arlechino/Harlequin/buttons), the lovers etc. These plays usually have an emphasis on [[moral dilemma]]s, and good always triumphs over evil, this kind of play is also very entertaining making it a very effective way of reaching many people.

Pantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture dating back to classical theatre. It developed partly from the 16th century [[commedia dell'arte]] tradition of Italy, as well as other European and British stage traditions, such as 17th-century [[masque]]s and [[music hall]].&lt;ref name=Reid/&gt; An important part of the pantomime, until the late 19th century, was the [[harlequinade]].&lt;ref name=HistoryIBY&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/Factsheets/The%20History%20of%20Pantomime.pdf "The History of Pantomime"], It's-Behind-You.com, 2002, accessed 10 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Britain the word "pantomime" is usually used to mean '''[[Mime artist|miming]]''', rather than the theatrical form discussed here.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Webster's New World Dictionary]]'', World Publishing Company, 2nd College Edition, 1980, p. 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mime==
[[Mime artist|Mime]] is a theatrical medium where the action of a story is told through the movement of the body, without the use of speech. Performance of mime occurred in [[Ancient Greece]], and the word is taken from a single masked dancer called ''Pantomimus'', although their performances were not necessarily silent.&lt;ref&gt;Gutzwiller (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Medieval]] Europe, early forms of mime, such as [[Mummers Play|mummer play]]s and later [[dumbshow]]s, evolved. In the early nineteenth century [[Paris]], [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]] solidified the many attributes that we have come to know in modern times, including the silent figure in whiteface.&lt;ref&gt;Rémy (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Copeau]], strongly influenced by [[Commedia dell'arte]] and Japanese [[Noh]] theatre, used masks in the training of his actors. [[Étienne Decroux]], a pupil of his, was highly influenced by this and started exploring and developing the possibilities of mime and refined [[corporeal mime]] into a highly sculptural form, taking it outside of the realms of [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]]. [[Jacques Lecoq]] contributed significantly to the development of mime and [[physical theatre]] with his training methods.&lt;ref name=Callery&gt;Callery (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballet==
While some ballet emphasises "the lines and patterns of movement itself" dramatic dance "expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [https://www.britannica.com/art/dance/Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; Such ballets are theatrical works that have characters and "tell a story",&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; Dance movements in ballet "are often closely related to everyday forms of physical expression, [so that] there is an expressive quality inherent in nearly all dancing", and this is used to convey both action and emotions; mime is also used.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'', which tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse, [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ballet ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', based on Shakespeare's famous play, and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', which tells tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets.

== Creative drama ==
Creative drama includes dramatic activities and games used primarily in educational settings with children. Its roots in the United States began in the early 1900s. [[Winifred Ward]] is considered to be the founder of creative drama in education, establishing the first academic use of drama in Evanston, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich (1974, 75–80).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:കൂടിയാട്ടത്തിലെസുഗ്രീവൻ.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Performer playing [[Sugriva]] in the [[Koodiyattam]] form of [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]].]]
The earliest form of [[India]]n drama was the [[Sanskrit drama]].&lt;ref name="RSZ12"&gt;Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1st century AD and the 10th was a period of relative peace in the [[history of India]] during which hundreds of plays were written.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 70) and Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquests]] that began in the 10th and 11th centuries, theatre was discouraged or forbidden entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 72) and Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in an attempt to re-assert indigenous values and ideas, village theatre was encouraged across the subcontinent, developing in a large number of regional languages from the 15th to the 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 72), Richmond (1998, 516), and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Indian theatre developed during the [[British Raj|period of colonial rule]] under the [[British Empire]], from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1998, 516) and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sanskrit theatre====
{{Main|Sanskrit drama}}
The earliest-surviving fragments of [[Sanskrit drama]] date from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 516–517).&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516"&gt;Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient ''[[Vedas]]'' ([[hymn]]s from between 1500 and 1000 BC that are among the earliest examples of [[History of literature#India|literature]] in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of [[dialogue]]) and the [[ritual]]s of the [[Vedic period]] do not appear to have developed into theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516"/&gt; The ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'' by [[Patañjali]] contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.&lt;ref name="Richmond517"&gt;Richmond (1998, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise on [[grammar]] from 140 BC provides a feasible date for the beginnings of [[theatre in India]].&lt;ref name="Richmond517"/&gt;

The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is ''[[Natyashastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' (''Nātyaśāstra''), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BC to 200 AD) and whose authorship is attributed to [[Bharata Muni]]. The ''Treatise'' is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses [[acting]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]], architecture, [[Costume design|costuming]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account of the origin of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond517"/&gt;

Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of [[Sanskrit literature]].&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii"&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii).&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised [[stock character]]s, such as the hero (''nayaka''), heroine (''nayika''), or clown (''vidusaka''). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. It was patronized by the kings as well as village assemblies. Famous early playwrights include [[Bhasa]], [[Kalidasa]] (famous for ''[[Vikramōrvaśīyam|Vikrama and Urvashi]]'', ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram|Malavika and Agnimitra]]'', and ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|The Recognition of Shakuntala]]''), [[Śudraka]] (famous for ''[[Mṛcchakatika|The Little Clay Cart]]''), [[Asvaghosa]], [[Daṇḍin]], and [[Harsha|Emperor Harsha]] (famous for ''[[Nagananda]]'', ''[[Ratnavali]],'' and ''[[Priyadarsika]]''). ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|Śakuntalā]]'' (in English translation) influenced [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1808–1832).&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii"/&gt;

====Modern Indian drama====
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
[[Rabindranath Tagore]] was a pioneering modern playwright who wrote plays noted for their exploration and questioning of nationalism, identity, spiritualism and material greed.&lt;ref name="Banham1051"&gt;Banham (1998, 1051).&lt;/ref&gt; His plays are written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and include ''Chitra'' (''Chitrangada'', 1892), ''The King of the Dark Chamber'' (''Raja'', 1910), ''[[The Post Office (play)|The Post Office]]'' (''Dakghar'', 1913), and ''Red Oleander'' (''Raktakarabi'', 1924).&lt;ref name="Banham1051"/&gt;
[[Girish Karnad]] is a noted playwright, who has written a number of plays that use history and mythology, to critique and problematize ideas and ideals that are of contemporary relevance. Karnad's numerous plays such as ''Tughlaq'', ''Hayavadana'', ''[[Taledanda]]'', and ''Naga-Mandala'' are significant contributions to Indian drama. [[Vijay Tendulkar]] and [[Mahesh Dattani]] are amongst the major Indian playwrights of the 20th century. Mohan Rakesh in Hindi and [[Danish Iqbal]] in Urdu are considered architects of new age Drama. Mohan Rakesh's Aadhe Adhoore and Danish Iqbal's ''Dara Shikoh'' are considered modern classics.

====Modern Urdu drama of India and Pakistan====
{{Original research|section|date=December 2011}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
Urdu Drama evolved from the prevailing dramatic traditions of North India shaping Rahas or Raas as practiced by exponents like [[Nawab Wajid Ali Shah]] (1822 – 1887) of [[Awadh]]. His dramatic experiments led to the famous [[Inder Sabha]] of Amanat and later this tradition took the shape of Parsi Theatre. Agha Hashr Kashmiri is the culmination of this tradition.

Urdu theatre tradition has greatly influenced modern [[Indian theatre]]. Theatre has flourished in [[Urdu]] (which was called [[Hindi]] by early writers), along with [[Gujarati language|Gujrati]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. Urdu drama has had an important influence on [[Hindi film industry|Bombay Film industry]] and all the early works of Urdu theatre (performed by Parsi Companies) were made into films. Urdu dramatic tradition has existed for more than a 100 years.

Prof Hasan, Ghulam Jeelani, J.N,Kaushal, Shameem Hanfi, Jameel Shaidayi, etc. belong to the old generation, contemporary writers like Danish Iqbal, Sayeed Alam, Shahid Anwar, Iqbal Niyazi, and Anwar are a few [[postmodern]] playwrights actively contributing in the field of Urdu Drama.

Sayeed Alam is known for his wit and humour and more particularly for plays like 'Ghalib in New Delhi', 'Big B' and many other works, which are regularly staged for large audiences. ''Maulana Azad'' is his most important play both for its content and style.

Danish Iqbal's play ''[[Dara Shikoh]]'' directed by [[M. S. Sathyu]] is a modern classic that uses newer theatre techniques and a contemporary perspective. His other plays are ''[[Sahir]]''. on the famous lyricist and revolutionary poet. ''Kuchh Ishq kiya Kuchh Kaam'' is another play written by Danish which is basically a Celebration of [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz|Faiz]]'s poetry, featuring events from the early part of his life, particularly the events and incidents of pre-partition days which shaped his life and ideals. ''Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan'' – another play inspired from Faiz's letters written from various jails during the [[Rawalpindi Conspiracy]] days. He has written 14 other plays including ''Dilli Jo Ek Shehr Thaa'' and ''Main Gaya Waqt Nahin hoon''. Shahid's ''Three B'' is also a significant play. He has been associated with many groups like 'Natwa' and others. Zaheer Anwar has kept the flag of Urdu theatre flying in [[Kolkata]]. Unlike the writers of previous generation Sayeed, Shahid, Danish Iqbal and Zaheer do not write bookish plays but their work is a product of performing tradition. Iqbal Niyazi of [[Mumbai]] has written several plays in Urdu, his play ''AUR KITNE JALYANWALA BAUGH?'' won a National award other awards. Hence this is the only generation after Amanat and Agha Hashr who actually write for stage and not for libraries.

===China===
{{Main article|Theatre of China}}
[[File:1958 CPA 2262.jpg|thumb|A 1958 [[U.S.S.R.]] [[postage stamp]] commemorating [[Guan Hanqing]], one of the great Chinese dramatists, who is renowned for his "[[zaju]]" plays.]]

Chinese theatre has a long and complex history. Today it is often called [[Chinese opera]] although this normally refers specifically to the popular form known as [[Beijing opera]] and [[Kunqu]]; there have been many other forms of theatre in China, such as [[zaju]].

===Japan===
{{Main article|Theatre of Japan}}
Japanese [[Noh|Nō drama]] is a serious dramatic form that combines drama, music, and dance into a complete aesthetic performance experience. It developed in the 14th and 15th centuries and has its own musical instruments and performance techniques, which were often handed down from father to son. The performers were generally male (for both male and female roles), although female amateurs also perform Nō dramas. Nō drama was supported by the government, and particularly the military, with many military commanders having their own troupes and sometimes performing themselves. It is still performed in Japan today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iijnet.or.jp/NOH-KYOGEN/english/english.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050715090014/http://www.iijnet.or.jp/NOH-KYOGEN/english/english.html| archivedate=2005-07-15| accessdate=2013-02-27| deadurl=yes| title=Background to Noh-Kyogen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kyōgen]] is the comic counterpart to Nō drama. It concentrates more on dialogue and less on music, although Nō instrumentalists sometimes appear also in Kyōgen. [[Kabuki]] drama, developed from the 17th century, is another comic form, which includes dance.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' in popular culture}}

''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''D&amp;D'') is a fantasy [[role-playing game]] first published in 1974. As the popularity of the game grew throughout the late-1970s and 1980s, it became referenced in popular culture more frequently. The complement of games, films and cultural references based on ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' or similar fantasies, characters, and adventures became ubiquitous after the end of the 1970s.

''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', and [[tabletop role-playing games]] in general, have exerted a deep and persistent impact on the development of all types of [[video game]]s, from "[[first-person shooter]]s to [[real-time strategy]] games and [[massively multiplayer online game]]s",&lt;ref name=tychen2006/&gt; which in turn play a significant and ongoing role in modern [[popular culture]].&lt;ref name=rausch2004/&gt;

In online culture, the term ''dungeon'' has since come to mean a virtual location where people can meet and collaborate. Hence, [[multi-user dungeon]]s emerged throughout the 1970s and 1980s as a form of [[social network]]s or a social virtual reality.&lt;ref name="steels2004" /&gt; By creating a means for players to assemble and explore an imaginary world, the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' rules provided a transition from fantasy literary settings, such as those of author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], to fully [[virtual world]]s.&lt;ref name="heider2009" /&gt;

[[Public figure]]s who play or have played ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' include comedians [[Stephen Colbert]] and [[Chris Hardwick]], musician [[Moby]], and actors [[Vin Diesel]], [[Matthew Lillard]], [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Wil Wheaton]], and [[Robin Williams]].&lt;ref name="shanafelt05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tonjes05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dnd30" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oswalt07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="myers04" /&gt;

==Literature==
=== Books ===
{{See also|Dungeons &amp; Dragons (novels)}}
Independent fiction derived from the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game appeared with the ''[[Endless Quest]]'' series of books, published by [[TSR, Inc]] between 1982 and 1987. The ''Endless Quest'' books provided a form of [[interactive fiction]] in the style of the [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] series.&lt;ref name=tresca2010/&gt; The continuing success of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' then sparked an even more extensive series of novels, also published by TSR, Inc. The first of these were based upon the ''[[Dragonlance]]'' campaign setting, and were released in 1984.&lt;ref name=mackay2001/&gt; There proved to be a lucrative market for these works, and by the 2000s a significant portion of all fantasy paperbacks were being published by [[Wizards of the Coast]], the American game company that acquired TSR, Inc in 1997.&lt;ref name=buker2002/&gt;

The impact of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' on players and culture has inspired reflective non-fiction works:
* ''Fantasy Freaks and Gaming Geeks: An Epic Quest for Reality Among Role Players, Online Gamers, and Other Dwellers of Imaginary Realms'', by journalist and gamer [[Ethan Gilsdorf]]; a travel memoir about ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', role-playing games, and other fantasy and gaming subcultures.&lt;ref name=dont_escape/&gt;
* ''The Elfish Gene: Dungeons, Dragons and Growing Up Strange'', by novelist [[Mark Barrowcliffe]]; a memoir of playing ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and other role playing games in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=harrison20081107/&gt;
* Author [[Shelly Mazzanoble]] wrote a humorous self-help guide called ''Everything I Need to Know I Learned from Dungeons &amp; Dragons: One Woman's Quest to Trade Self-help for Elf-help''. This followed her guide book, ''Confessions of a Part-time Sorceress: A Girl's Guide to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game''.&lt;ref name=wired20070926/&gt;
* ''American Nerd: The Story of My People'' is [[Time magazine]] writer [[Benjamin Nugent]]'s study of the history and culture of people labeled nerds. It includes insights into why people play and enjoy ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref name=nugent2009/&gt;

Several characters created for playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, or games derived from ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', have later spawned popular fantasy series.&lt;ref name=carlisle2009/&gt; Other novels make off-hand references to the game:

=== Comics ===
Begun in 1986, the comic books ''The Adventurers'' and ''[[Redfox (comics)|Redfox]]'' were inspired by ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref name=booker2010/&gt; Several commercial [[comic strip]]s are based entirely upon the game or make reference to the game in specific panels.
* ''[[Knights of the Dinner Table]]'' is a multiple award-winning&lt;ref name=panzeri2006/&gt; comic-sized magazine featuring comic strips with a variety of characters who play "HackMaster," a parody of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''. (''[[HackMaster]]'' would later go on to become an actual role-playing game.) Early strips appeared in the official ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' magazine ''[[Dragon]]''.
* The ''[[Order of the Stick]]'' is an award-winning&lt;ref name=comics_village08/&gt; satirical webcomic that features a cast of characters in a world that loosely operates by the rules of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref name=grossman070131/&gt;
* ''[[Penny Arcade]]'', A longstanding webcomic, created by ''[[Jerry Holkins]]'' and ''[[Mike Krahulik]]'', references and even depicts humorous instances of bizarre campaigns, and other ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' subject matter; implementing dice-rolling humor and other game dynamics.

==Visual media==
=== Film ===
{{Main|Dungeons &amp; Dragons (film series)}}

The film included parodies of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''-influenced films.&lt;ref name=wired20081104/&gt;
* The short film ''[[Fear of Girls]]'' is a spoof of two heavy ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' gamers. The filmmakers used viral marketing to attract attention to the film.&lt;ref name=lees2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=mst20070128/&gt;

== Players ==
[[Stephen Colbert]] developed an intense interest in the game during his youth, which he later credited for his talent at character creation.&lt;ref name=carter2010/&gt; Ethan Gilsdorf credited the game for bestowing upon him "gifts of creativity and self-actualization".&lt;ref name=gilsdorf2011/&gt; Actor Vin Diesel, in his introduction to the book ''Thirty Years of Adventure'', wrote that he was "attracted to the artistic outlet the game provided" and that the game was "a training ground for our imagination and an opportunity to explore our own identities".&lt;ref name=diesel2004/&gt; Vin Diesel, Mike Myers, and Robin Williams also participated in the 2006 [[Worldwide Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game Day]], demonstrating that the game was then still a lively and active hobby.&lt;ref name=game_day07/&gt;

Director Chris Weitz pointed out that there "are a lot of people who played and are horribly embarrassed about it and won't admit it, because it's part of their lives they put behind". He developed a fervent interest in the game, even greater than in making movies, and said the experience "had such an influence on his life".&lt;ref name=scott2005/&gt; Director Jon Favreau was drawn into the game by the fantasy elements and the sense of story, saying "it gave me a really strong background in imagination, storytelling, understanding how to create tone and a sense of balance".&lt;ref name=favreau08/&gt;

Political reporter John J. Miller said that ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' was a big part of his life during his school years, and argued that, "there's a lot to admire about ''D&amp;D'' and what it can do for kids by encouraging them to read, do math, and think creatively".&lt;ref name=miller2004/&gt; Fantasy author China Miéville said that playing ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' as a youth was one of the most enduring influences on his writing. The two things that particularly influenced him were "the mania for cataloging the fantastic" and "the weird fetish for systematization", in that everything is reduced to "game stats".&lt;ref name=gordon2003/&gt; In contrast, author Mark Barrowcliffe considers his years playing ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' to be a wasted youth and all of the players to be nerds. He has tried to put the experience behind him.&lt;ref name=barrowcliffe2008/&gt;

'''"Flood"''' is the sixth episode of British [[sitcom]] ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]''. It was written by [[Ben Elton]], [[Rik Mayall]] and [[Lise Mayer]], and directed by [[K. Paul Jackson|Paul Jackson]]. It was first aired on [[BBC2]] on 14 December 1982 and was the final episode of the first series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0752257/ | title = "The Young Ones" Flood (1982) | accessdate = 1 May 2009 | publisher = Internet Movie Database | quote = Original Air Date: 14 December 1982 (Season 1, Episode 6)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
With none of the quartet noticing a medieval execution in their back garden, there is initial tranquility in the house, with Neil randomly hitting himself in the face with a [[frying pan]], and Vyvyan reading one of Rick's ''"[[SS]] Death Camp Battalion go to [[Monte Cassino]] for the Massacre"'' war [[comic]]s, leading to an argument with Rick over the comic's content. After Neil prepares to go on a shopping trip for "Everything except Green Globules and [[Mousse|Super Mousse]]", Vyvyan mentions that he had concocted a 'homicidal axe-wielding maniac' potion disguised in a [[Coca-Cola]] can, that transforms the drinker into said person, under the guise of a "cure for not being a homicidal axe-wielding maniac", to which Vyvyan mentions the potential size of the market for such an invention.

However, the [[monsoon]]-like rain outside soon traps everyone in the house and a game of [[hide and seek]] gets underway to pass the time. During this time, the house takes on a [[Narnia]]-esque feel, with a [[lion taming|lion tamer]] in Mike's bedroom and Vyvyan finding a witch in a [[sleigh]] lurking in a new world at the back of the [[wardrobe]] where he was hiding. But all that - plus the [[shark]]s at the window and the [[arson]] attack on Rick's bedroom caused by Vyvyan - becomes irrelevant as Mr. Balowski arrives, unwittingly drinks Vyvyan's [[potion]], and goes on the hunt. As Mike, Rick and Vyvyan prepare to kill Neil for food with an electric [[hedge trimmer]], Mr. Balowski breaks down the door to Neil's room with an [[axe]], leading to the group trying to escape him. After tricking Mr. Balowski into entering Mike's room, which was being rented out to Bobby the Lion Tamer and his man-eating [[lion]]s, the group notice that the flood waters are subsiding. The episode ended by showing Vyvyan's [[hamster]], [[Special Patrol Group|SPG]], floating on a discarded [[McEwan's]] Export can on the flood waters, as if to prove he had survived Vyvyan's angry outburst which led to him throwing him outside.

==Characters==
As with all episodes of ''The Young Ones'', the main four characters were student flatmates Mike ([[Christopher Ryan]]); Vyvyan ([[Adrian Edmondson]]); Rick ([[Rik Mayall]]) and Neil ([[Nigel Planer]]). The episode also features their [[landlord]] Jerzei Balowski ([[Alexei Sayle]]), a character who was appearing for the second time during the first series, and would appear once more in total.

This episode was the only one of the dozen made not to feature a band performing mid-show; the lion-tamer provided the "[[cabaret]]" instead. 

==Cultural references==
While the boys are playing hide-and-seek, Vyvyan hides in a wardrobe and ends in a [[Narnia]]-like world. Mr. Balowski's [[axe murder|axe-murdering]] condition cause by Vyvyan's potion is a reference to Stephen King's novel, [[The Shining (novel)|''The Shining'']].

The monks at the medieval execution at the beginning are chanting 'Dominus [[ad nauseam]]', which means '[Discussing] the Lord to [the point of] nausea'. SPG has an [[olive branch]] in his mouth at the end, a biblical reference (Genesis 8:11) to the dove in the story of Noah.

[[File:Focus puller.jpg|thumb|right|A focus puller]]
A '''focus puller''', or 1st assistant camera, is a member of a [[film crew]]'s camera department whose primary responsibility is to maintain image [[Sharpness (visual)|sharpness]] on whatever subject or action is being filmed.

"Pulling focus" or "[[Racking focus|rack focusing]]" refers to the act of changing the [[Camera lens|lens]]'s focus distance setting in correspondence to a moving subject's physical distance from the focal plane.  For example, if an actor moves from 8m to 3m away from the focal plane within a shot, the focus puller will change the distance setting on the lens during the take in precise relation to the changing position of the actor.  Additionally, the focus puller may shift focus from one subject to another within the frame, as dictated by the specific requirements of the [[cinematic techniques|shot]].

A good focus puller will have an intimate knowledge of cinematographic and optical theory.  Depending on the parameters of a given shot, there is often very little room for error.  As such, the role of a focus puller is extremely important within the realm of a film production; a "soft" image will, in most circumstances, be considered unusable, since there is no way to fix such an error in post-production.  One must also consider that an actor may not be able to duplicate his or her best performance in a subsequent take, so the focus puller is expected to perform flawlessly on every take.  Because of these factors, some production personnel consider the focus puller to have the most difficult job on set.

British [[cinematographer]] [[Oliver Stapleton]] has written:
{{quote| The 1st AC (or Focus Puller) has one of the hardest jobs on the set. And it's one of those jobs that are never noticed until it is wrong. Then you get an almighty bollocking, or you get fired&amp;nbsp;... Focus Pulling not only involves what it sounds like, but also the Focus Puller "runs" the department, in the sense of taking care of all the camera gear, and making sure that everything is tickety-boo. I have my own camera, so it's treated very well! A focus puller relies heavily on the Operator to tell him if the shot is out of focus&amp;nbsp;— after all only the operator is actually looking through the lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cineman.co.uk/#camera |title=Camera Department |work=So You Wanna Work in Movies? |first=Oliver |last=Stapleton |accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During production, 1st ACs are also responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of all camera equipment and accessories, including; lenses, filters, batteries, film magazines/recording media, matte boxes, etc., as well as  configuring the camera and its accessories in multiple ways for different setups. 1st ACs arrive on set before the director, [[director of photography]] (DoP) and [[camera operator]], and ensures the camera and all required lenses are prepared for the day's shoot.  During filming, the 1st AC is responsible for moving the camera to each setup as directed by the Director of Photography. On larger budget productions, the camera is usually mounted on a dolly for most of the day, which is operated by the Dolly Grip.  At the end of each shooting day, 1st ACs clean the equipment and pack it up in preparation for the next day. If there is a problem with the rushes (such as a scratch on the film), the focus puller communicates with the film lab to fix any faults with the camera or film stock.

==Focus pulling==
Sharp focus is fundamental to reproducing a realistic, appealing image, and a viewer's attention is automatically drawn to sharper areas. When done correctly, good pulling goes mostly unnoticed by the audience.

The shooting of a scene typically begins with a blocking rehearsal, in which the various actors' positions are established.  During the rehearsal, the 2nd AC lays tape marks on the floor at all points an actor pauses movement. The actors then leave set to go through hair and makeup, and stand-ins come in to take their places at these various positions for the purposes of lighting, framing, and focus-mark setting.  Once a camera position is established by the director of photography and camera operator, the 1st AC begins to measure the various distances between the actors' marks and the focal plane of the camera. These distances are recorded in a series of grease pencil/pen marks on the focus barrel of the lens, and/or the marking disc on the follow focus device.  Using the stand-ins or 2nd AC, marks are checked through the viewfinder and/or the onboard monitor for accuracy.  Marks may be repositioned in order to provide specific framing desired, and the 1st AC must be aware of this and re-measure/re-set his marks accordingly.  Additionally, the 1st AC may have the 2nd AC lay down specific distance marks on the floor which will be referenced during the take as actors move between their marks, in order to assist in accurately adjusting the focus to the correct intermediate distances.

When the actors return to set, there is usually a rehearsal for camera in which the focus puller and operator will practice the shot and make sure everything has been set up properly. During a take, the focus puller modifies the focus based on the dialog, movement of the actors or subject, movement of the camera, the DoP's directions, and compensates on the fly for actors missing their marks or any unforeseen movement. In cases where an obstruction prevents the focus puller from seeing all his marks, he may request the 2nd AC call the marks for him over a 2-way radio during the shot.  In some situations, such as on long lenses, wide apertures, very close distances, or any combination of the three, a subject moving even a few millimeters may require immediate and very precise focus correction.

After a take, if the focus puller feels he's made a mistake—be it a  timing error, a missed mark, or any other issue which may have rendered some part of the take "soft," he or she will typically report this to the operator (who most likely noticed the error in the viewfinder) or director of photography, and may ask for another take if another wasn't already planned.

Traditionally, the focus puller used only his marks and his own well-developed sense of distance estimation to achieve good results.  Over the last decade, the increased use of digital cameras, higher-resolution [[video tap]]s and/or on-camera monitors have provided focus pullers with additional tools to help maintain proper focus. A high-definition monitor can be particularly useful when a fast-paced production simply does not allow time for the focus puller to set and check all marks that may be needed, or if no rehearsal will be provided.

Professional 1st ACs have many tricks for pulling focus in difficult situations or when accurate measurement is impossible.  Often, before a scene is even rehearsed or established, the 1st AC will take surveying measurements of the general environment in order to have a good idea of the distance between reference points, such as patterns on the floor or walls, furniture, and whatever else might be around. These reference measurements can be used to quickly establish rough distances between the camera and the subject in chaotic shooting circumstances.

In addition to keen eyesight, reflexes, and intuition, the focus puller's primary tools are a cloth or fiberglass tape measure, steel tape measure, laser rangefinder, and in some cases an on-camera ultrasonic rangefinder which provides a real-time distance readout mounted on the side of the mattebox or camera body.  In setups where the focus puller cannot touch the camera, such as on steadicam or crane shots, he or she will use a remote follow focus system, though some focus pullers prefer using a remote system at all times.

==Other duties==
At the end of a successfully shot scene, the focus puller will be called upon to "Check the gate". This involves removing the lens and inspecting, with the aid of a flashlight and magnifying glass, the aperture to which the film is held during exposure. The focus puller is looking for any foreign bodies, e.g. hair, bits of broken film, fluff etc., that would show on the film and therefore ruin the scene that has just been filmed. This obviously is only relevant to shooting on film: however, a similar task is required for digital movie cameras (although not nearly as often) which involves checking the sensor.

The 1st AC reports to the [[director of photography]], works alongside the [[camera operator]], and oversees the [[Clapper loader|2nd assistant camera]] (also known as the "clapper loader") and any other members of the camera department.

''frankie magazine'' is owned and published by niche publisher Morrison Media, and makes up "frankiepress" along with its men's publication, ''Smith Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankiepress.com.au Frankie press]&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison Media was acquired by Pacific Star Network in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alex Hayes|title=Frankie publisher Morrison Media bought out in $10m deal|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/frankie-publisher-morrison-media-bought-10m-deal-262164|accessdate=29 October 2016|work=Mumbrella|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both founders of the magazine, Louise Bannister and Lara Burke, left the magazine before the acquisition.&lt;ref name="meg"/&gt;

The magazine was headquartered in [[Queensland]] until 2013 when it was relocated in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="meg"/&gt;

==Readership==
The magazine's audience has grown rapidly since its inception. It is now estimated to be read by 286,000 globally. Despite the 2008 [[Global Financial Crisis]], that saw Australian magazine sales drop 3%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Wells|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/forget-celebrity-goss-this-mag-plays-it-smart-and-cool-20100220-omrv.html|title=Forget celebrity goss, this mag plays it smart and cool|work=The Age|date=20 February 2010|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, frankie magazine's circulation rose by 31.60% in 2009: making frankie magazine the fastest growing magazine in Australia during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/06/09/2922264.htm|title=Homemade magazine bucks the trend|work=ABC|date=9 June 2010|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication continued this trend in 2010, with circulation rising another 43.20%, according to the Australian Bureau of Circulation's January–June 2010 audit figures. This was the second year in a row that they had the highest growth out of all Australian magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/abcs-masterchef-magazine-hits-the-big-time-while-rise-of-frankie-continues-31473|title=ABCs: Masterchef magazine hits the big time while rise of Frankie continues|work=Mumbrella|date=13 August 2010|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, [[Harper's Bazaar]] had an increase of 9.04% over the same time period.

frankie magazine also has significant social media impact, having a notable social media presence in Australian publishing, with over 175,000 Facebook fans and 55,000 Twitter followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/frankiemagazine|title=frankie magazine (@frankiemagazine)|work=Twitter|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
frankie magazine covers a range of cultural topics that concern the 10 - to 15 -year-old age bracket. Their content features DIY and vintage culture as well as music, art, fashion, photography, craft, humour, hipster culture, illustration and design. ABC's [[7:30 Report]] described ''frankie magazine'' as being between "quite edgy" and "quite daggy", having a strong emphasis on strong, curious stories instead of diets and celebrity culture, supporting emerging artists, musicians, entrepreneurs and designers and preferring to profile up-and-coming hipsters rather than existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2010/s2921938.htm|title=The 7.30 Report |work=ABC|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franz  Xaver Winterhalter''' (20 April 1805 – 8 July 1873) was a German painter and [[lithography|lithographer]], known for his portraits of royalty in the mid-19th century. His name has become associated with fashionable court [[portrait painting|portraiture]]. Among his best known works are ''[[Empress Eugénie]] Surrounded by her Ladies in Waiting'' (1855) and the portraits he made of Empress [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth of Austria]] (1865).

== Early years ==
Franz Xaver Winterhalter was born in the small village of [[Menzenschwand]], (now part of [[Sankt Blasien]]), in Germany's [[Black Forest]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paul Getty|first1=J|title=Franz Xaver Winterhalter|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/artists/724/franz-xaver-winterhalter-german-1805-1873/|website=The J. Paul Getty Museum|publisher=J Paul Getty Trust|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Electorate of Baden]], on 20 April 1805.&lt;ref name=obo18&gt;Ormond &amp; Blackett-Ord, ''Franz Xaver Winterhalter and the Courts of Europe'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the sixth child of Fidel Winterhalter (1773–1863), a farmer and resin producer in the village, and his wife Eva Meyer (1765–1838), a member of a long established Menzenschwand family.&lt;ref name=obo18/&gt; His father was of peasant stock and was a powerful influence in his life. Of the eight brothers and sisters, only four survived infancy. Throughout his life Franz Xaver remained very close to his family, in particular to his brother [[Hermann Winterhalter|Hermann]] (1808–1891), who was also a painter.&lt;ref&gt;Ormond &amp; Blackett-Ord, ''Franz Xaver Winterhalter and the Courts of Europe'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending school at a [[Benedictine]] monastery in St. Blasien, Winterhalter left Menzenschwand in 1818 at the age of 13 to study drawing and engraving.&lt;ref&gt;Ormond &amp; Blackett-Ord, ''Franz Xaver Winterhalter and the Courts of Europe'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He trained as a draughtsman and lithographer in the workshop of Karl Ludwig Schüler (1785–1852) in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]. In 1823, at the age of 18, he went to Munich, sponsored by the industrialist Baron von Eichtal (1775–1850).&lt;ref&gt;Ormond &amp; Blackett-Ord, ''Franz Xaver Winterhalter and the Courts of Europe'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1825, he was granted a stipend by Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Baden (1763–1830) and began a course of study at the Academy of Arts in [[Munich]] with [[Peter von Cornelius]] (1783–1867), whose academic methods made him uncomfortable. Winterhalter found a more congenial mentor in the fashionable portraitist [[Joseph Stieler]] (1781–1858). During this time, he supported himself working as lithographer.&lt;ref name=obo25&gt;Ormond &amp; Blackett-Ord, ''Franz Xaver Winterhalter and the Courts of Europe'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winterhalter entered court circles when in 1828 he became drawing master to [[Sophie of Sweden|Sophie Margravine of Baden]], at [[Karlsruhe]].&lt;ref name=obo25/&gt; His opportunity to establish himself beyond southern Germany came in 1832 when he was able to travel to Italy, 1833–1834, with the support of [[Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden|Grand Duke Leopold of Baden]]. In Rome he composed romantic genre scenes in the manner of [[Louis Léopold Robert]] and attached himself to the circle of the director of the French Academy, [[Horace Vernet]]. On his return to Karlsruhe he painted portraits of the Grand Duke Leopold of Baden and his wife, and was appointed painter to the grand-ducal court.

Nevertheless, he left Baden to move to France, where his Italian genre scene ''Il dolce Farniente'' attracted notice at the Salon of 1836. ''Il Decameron'' a year later was also praised; both paintings are academic compositions in the style of [[Raphael]]. In the Salon of 1838 he exhibited a portrait of [[Napoléon Alexandre Berthier|the Prince of Wagram]] with his young daughter. His career as a portrait painter was soon secured when in the same year he painted [[Louise-Marie of France|Louise Marie of Orleans]], Queen of the Belgians, and [[Leopold II of Belgium|her son]]. It was probably through this painting that Winterhalter came to the notice of [[Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies]], Queen of the French, mother of the Queen of the Belgians.

== Court painter ==

Paul [[Getty Museum]], Los Angeles. Winterhalter contrasted sumptuous fabrics and vivid colors against creamy flesh to heighten the sensuality of the pose, the model, and the luxuriant setting.&lt;ref&gt;Ormond &amp; Blackett-Ord, ''Franz Xaver Winterhalter and the Courts of Europe'', p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In Paris, Winterhalter quickly became fashionable. He was appointed [[court painter]] of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], the king of the French, who commissioned him to paint individual portraits of his large family. Winterhalter would execute more than thirty commissions for him.

This success earned the painter the reputation of a specialist in dynastic and aristocratic portraiture, skilled in combining likeness with flattery and enlivening official pomp with modern fashion.

However, Winterhalter's reputation in artistic circles suffered. The critics, who had praised his debut in the salon of 1836, dismissed him as a painter who could not be taken seriously. This attitude persisted throughout Winterhalter's career, condemning his work to a category of his own in the hierarchy of painting. Winterhalter himself regarded his first royal commissions as a temporary intermission before returning to [[subject painting]] and the field of academic respectability, but he was a victim of his own success, and for the rest of his life he worked almost exclusively as a portrait painter. His success in this field made him rich. Winterhalter became an international celebrity enjoying Royal patronage.

[[File:Winterhalter Katarzyna Potocka.jpg|thumb|left|''Katarzyna Potocka in oriental costume'' (1854), [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]], [[Warsaw]]. Countess Potocka sat for this portrait in Paris, where she went after returning from a trip to the [[Holy Land]]. [[Róża Potocka (1849–1937)|Róża Krasińska]], who with her mother went to Paris, wrote that she was "a few times in the Winterhalter's studio, while the mother posed for her portraits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Aldona |last=Cholewianka-Kruszyńska |title=Panny Branickie z Białej Cerkwi na portretach F. X. Winterhaltera |year=2001 |editor= |pages=14–21|volume=9 |chapterurl= |publisher=Gazeta Antykwaryczna}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Among his many regal sitters was also [[Queen Victoria]]. Winterhalter first visited England in 1842, and returned several times to paint Victoria, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] and their growing family, painting at least 120 works for them, a large number of which remain in the [[Royal Collection]], on display to the public at [[Buckingham Palace]] and other royal residences. Winterhalter also painted a few portraits of the aristocracy in England, mostly members of court circles. The fall of Louis-Philippe in 1848 did not affect the painter's reputation. Winterhalter went to [[Switzerland]] and worked in Belgium and England.
[[Image:Winterhalter Franz Xavier The Empress Eugenie Surrounded by her Ladies in Waiting.jpg|thumb|300px|''The [[Empress Eugénie]] Surrounded by her Ladies in Waiting'' (1855), [[Château de Compiègne]]. Taking its inspiration from 18th-century bucolic scenes, this monumental composition sets the empress and her entourage against the backdrop of a shady clearing in a forest. However, the composition is very artificial and formal. The empress, slightly to the left of center, is encircled by and dominates the group.]]
Persistence saw Winterhalter survive from the fall of one dynasty to the rise of another. Paris remained his home until a couple of years before his death. A halt in portrait commissions in France allowed him to return to subject painting with ''[[Florinda (painting)|Florinda]]'' (1852; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York), a joyous celebration of female beauty inspired by a Spanish legend. In the same year his marriage proposal was rejected, and Winterhalter remained a bachelor committed to his work.

After the accession of [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], his popularity grew. From then on, under the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], Winterhalter became the chief portraitist of the imperial family and court of France. The beautiful French [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]] became a favorite sitter, and she treated him generously. In 1855 Winterhalter painted his masterpiece: ''The Empress Eugénie Surrounded by her Ladies in Waiting''. He set the French Empress in a [[pastoral]] setting gathering flowers in a harmonious circle with her ladies in waiting. The painting was acclaimed, and exhibited in the universal exposition in 1855. It remains Winterhalter's most famous work.

In 1852, he went to Spain to paint Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] with [[Isabella, Princess of Asturias (1851–1931)|her daughter]]. Russian aristocratic visitors to Paris also liked to have their portraits executed by the famous master. As the "Painter of Princes", Winterhalter was thereafter in constant demand by the courts of Britain (from 1841), Spain, [[Belgium]], Russia, [[Mexico]], the German states, and France. During the 1850s and 1860s, Winterhalter painted a number of important portraits of Polish and Russian aristocrats. In 1857, he painted the portrait of [[Tsaritsa|Tsarina]] [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Maria Alexandrovna]].

During the [[Second Mexican Empire]] in the 1860s, headed by [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], Winterhalter was commissioned to paint portraits of the Imperial couple. The Empress consort of Mexico, [[Charlotte of Belgium]] was the daughter of [[Louise-Marie of France]], Queen of the Belgians, whom Winterhalter painted at the beginning of his career in France. Some of Winterhalter's paintings of the Mexican monarchs still remain in their Mexico City palace, [[Chapultepec Castle]], now the National Museum of History.

== Last years ==

To deal with those pressing for portrait commissions, many of whom were calling for multiple replicas, Winterhalter made extensive use of assistants. No portrait painter had ever enjoyed such an extraordinary royal patronage as Winterhalter; only [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]] worked as he did in an international network.

Winterhalter sought respite from the pressures of his work with holidays abroad in Italy, Switzerland, and above all Germany. Despite the many years he lived in France, he remained deeply attached to his native country. For all his success and popularity, Winterhalter continued to live simply and abstemiously. In 1859 he bought a villa in [[Baden-Baden]], his favorite vacation spot.

In 1864 Winterhalter made his last visit to England. In the autumn of that year he traveled to Vienna to execute the portraits of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Empress Elisabeth]] that remain among his most well-known works. As he grew older, Winterhalter's links with France weakened while his interest in Germany grew. He was taking a cure in Switzerland at the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the war that ended the [[Second French Empire]]. After the war, the painter did not return to France, going instead to [[Baden]]. He was officially still accredited at the court of Baden and he settled in [[Karlsruhe]]. In the last two years of his life Winterhalter painted very little. During a visit to [[Frankfurt am Main]] in the summer of 1873 he contracted [[typhus]] and died on 8 July. He was 68 years old.

== Style ==
[[Image:Empress Elisabeth of Austria with diamond stars on her hair.jpg|thumb|''[[Elisabeth of Bavaria]], Empress of Austria'' (1865), oil on canvas, 255 × 133 cm, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]]. This portrait presents the empress in a romantic fashion, enhancing her reputation as one of the great beauties of her time.&lt;ref name=obo217&gt;Ormond &amp; Blackett-Ord, ''Franz Xaver Winterhalter and the Courts of Europe'', p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; The empress appears in a sensual pose with naked shoulders and turning her head towards the viewer. She is wearing a white satin and tulle dress dotted with silver foil stars and with diamond stars in her hair. This portrait is one of Empress Elisabeth's most iconic representations and one of Winterhalter's best known works.&lt;ref name=obo217/&gt;]]

Winterhalter came into his own as a portrait painter during the second Empire and he painted his best work during the last two decades of his life. He matched his style to the luxury and relaxed atmosphere of the age, its [[hedonism]] and gaiety. His female sitters of the 1850s and 1860s inhabit a different physiological climate from those he painted earlier; they are not reticent and reserved. His male sitters inspired few original or memorable compositions.

Winterhalter never received high praise for his work from serious critics, being constantly accused of superficiality and affectation in pursuit of popularity. However, he was highly appreciated by his aristocratic patrons. The royal families of England, France, Spain, Russia, Portugal, Mexico, and Belgium all commissioned him to paint portraits. His monumental canvases established a substantial popular reputation, and [[lithography|lithographic]] copies of the portraits helped to spread his fame.

Winterhalter's portraits were prized for their subtle intimacy; the nature of his appeal is not difficult to explain. He created the image his sitters wished or needed to project to their subjects. He was not only skilled at posing his sitters to create almost theatrical compositions, but also was a virtuoso in the art of conveying the texture of fabrics, furs and jewellery, to which he paid no less attention than to the face. He painted very rapidly and very fluently, designing most of his compositions directly in the canvas. His portraits are elegant, refined, lifelike, and pleasantly idealized.

Concerning Winterhalter's method of working, it is thought that, practiced as he was at drawing and representing figures, he painted directly onto the canvas without making preliminary studies. He frequently decided upon the dress and pose of the sitter. His style was suave, [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] and plausible. Many of the portraits were copied in his workshop or reproduced as lithographs.

As an artist he remained a difficult figure to place; there are few painters with whom to compare him, and he does not fit into any school. His early affinities were [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] but his style can be described as Neo-[[Rococo]]. After his death, his painting fell out of favor, being considered romantic, glossy, and superficial. Little was known about him personally and his art was not taken seriously until recently. However, a major exhibition of his work at the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] (United Kingdom) in London and the [[Petit Palais]] in Paris in 1987 brought him into the limelight again. His paintings are exhibited today in leading European and American museums.

'''Harry Männil''' (May 17, 1920 – January 11, 2010), also known as '''Harry Mannil Laul'''{{ref label|a|a}}, was an [[Estonian people|Estonian]] businessman, [[art collector]], and cultural benefactor in several countries.

Männil was born in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].  As a result of [[World War II]] he moved to [[Venezuela]] in 1946, where he lived for the rest of his life. He was a successful businessman and part owner of [[ACO Group]], a large Venezuelan conglomerate. He formed his own company [[Grupo Oriand]] in 1994. At the time of the [[Singing Revolution|restoration of Estonian independence]], Männil got involved in Estonian matters, actively interacting with politicians [[Vaino Väljas]] and [[Edgar Savisaar]], and acting as an advisor during latter's prime minister term.

Harry Männil was an active art collector and philanthropist, especially noted for his collection of pre-Columbian art. His art related activities included serving as director of [[Caracas Athenaeum]] in Venezuela, and as advisor for the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. He also founded Eduard Wiiralt Gallery in [[Estonian National Library]].

== Biography ==
=== Early life (1920–1946) ===

Harry Männil was born into an iron salesman's family on May 17, 1920, in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], and spent his childhood in [[Pääsküla]], Tallinn.&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epl"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eilart|first=Andres|title=Costa Ricas suri tuntud väliseestlane Harry Männil|url=http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/486178|accessdate=18 August 2010|newspaper=Eesti Päevaleht|date=13 January 2010|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[Gustav Adolf Grammar School]] in 1938 and from 1939–40 studied economics at the [[University of Tartu]] and the [[Tallinn University of Technology]].&lt;ref name="ekspress"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ekspress.ee/news/paevauudised/vanakuld/in-memoriam-harry-mannil-sonnenfeldi-needus.d?id=28446343|title=Sonnenfeldi needus|first=Pekka|last=Erelt|date=January 5, 2006|newspaper=Eesti Ekspress|language=Estonian|accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1941, during the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]], he hid in a forest to avoid the [[mobilization]].&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt; Männil joined the [[political police]] of the [[Estonian Self-Administration]] as an assistant in September 1941. He held the position until June 10, 1942, when he was fired for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt; This period of collaboration with the Nazi government would later lead to Männil being accused of [[war crimes]]. After being relieved, Männil continued his studies at the University of Tartu.

In October 1943 he escaped to [[Finland]] when the [[Sicherheitsdienst|German Security Service]] began to consider him politically dangerous as a student leader at the university.&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nacion"&gt;{{cite news|last=Männil|first=Harry|title=Soy un empresario honorable|url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/junio/03/opinion1118307.html|newspaper=La Nación|date=June 3, 2007|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Finland he studied business management in [[Helsinki]].&lt;ref name=kaevats&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaevats |first=Ülo |title=Eesti Entsüklopeedia 14 |year=2000 |publisher=Tallinn: Eesti Entsüklopeediakirjastus |isbn=9985-70-064-3 |page= 313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Männil was accused by a local police official of illegal trade in gold and valuables brought to Finland by Estonian refugees. These claims were, however, denied by Männil.&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt;

Männil moved to [[Sweden]] in September 1944 with the intention of continuing his studies. He stayed at a [[refugee camp]] for a short while. Soon he received a [[residence permit]] to live in Stockholm and a [[working permit]] that allowed him to take a job at an archive. In November 1944, a complaint regarding Männil's Nazi involvement was filed at the Swedish Commission of Foreigners, and he was investigated by the [[Sandler Commission]].&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="megafeature"/&gt; The relative ease with which Männil received his work and residence permits raised the suspicions of the local authorities. In September 1945, he was fired from his job at the request of the Commission of Foreigners. A month later, an extension to his residence permit was declined.&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt; Männil was allowed to stay in Stockholm to make preparations  for his emigration to [[Venezuela]], and an extension was granted on his residence permit a short while later. After Männil was denied a [[transit visa]] to Britain, the Swedish authorities pressured him to leave the country.&lt;ref name="megafeature"&gt;{{cite news|title=MEGA FEATURE: Senjoor Harri Männil|url=http://www.epl.ee/?artikkel=152356|accessdate=10 October 2010|newspaper=Eesti Päevaleht|date=March 21, 2001|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Venezuela (1946–2010)===
When Männil arrived in [[Maracaibo]], Venezuela, in February 1946,&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt; he described himself as "penniless".&lt;ref name="Coronil"&gt;{{cite book |last=Coronil |first=Fernando |title=The magical state: nature, money, and modernity in Venezuela |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecTWdRNSJCcC&amp;pg=PA310 |isbn=978-0-226-11602-0 |pages=310–312 |chapter=Deere, ACO, and Harry Mannil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liivrand"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry Männil: Aastas kulub kunsti peale 100 000 dollarit|url=http://www.ekspress.ee/news/paevauudised/vanakuld/ee-1997-harry-mannil-aastas-kulub-kunsti-peale-100-000-dollarit.d?id=28447739|newspaper=Eesti Ekspress|accessdate=17 August 2010|author=Liivrand, Harry|author2=Mõtsar, Selle|language=Estonian|date=September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had traveled there under an employment contract to work for the enterprise headed by Juan Mendiri in Maracaibo and which later became part of BECO.  He joined  [[BECO]], a department store founded in 1942 and owned by Blohms, a family of German descent.&lt;ref name="Coronil"/&gt;  Beco was bought out by a group of investors headed by Arnold Orav together with Juan Simon Mendoza (co-founder of Venezuela's largest business empire, the Polar Group), and a couple of other Estonians, who, like Männil, were members of the [[corporation (university)|academic corporation]] [[Korporatsioon Vironia|Vironia]].&lt;ref name="Tattar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Erelt|first=Pekka|title=Mees, kes tegi Harry Männilist miljonäri|url=http://www.ekspress.ee/news/paevauudised/eestiuudised/article.php?id=28632309|accessdate=17 August 2010|newspaper=Eesti Ekspress|date=22 January 2010|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnold Carl Orav, Chmn, split from BECO in 1951 to form [[ACO Group]], a company that would eventually control over one-sixth of Venezuela's automotive trade.&lt;ref name="11-kultuuritegelast"/&gt; Männil received Venezuelan citizenship in 1952.&lt;ref name="EPL-Costa-Rica"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arileht.ee/artikkel/227153|title=Costa Rica ei luba Männilit natsimineviku pärast riiki|date=February 6, 2003|newspaper=Eesti Päevaleht|language=Estonian|accessdate=14 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720125308/http://www.arileht.ee/artikkel/227153|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Männil assumed the title of Chmn, in addition to CEO of the ACO Group,  It emerged in the 1970s as the world's largest [[tractor]] dealership as the dealer for [[John Deere Tractors]] in Venezuela.  It also became the largest [[automobile]] dealership in South America, according to the Ford Motors Company (USA).  A significant contributor to the success of the Aco Group was the innovative introduction in Venezuela of in-house auto sale financing using a captive finance company.&lt;ref name="Coronil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liivrand"/&gt; In 1983, the Aco Group was ranked fifth largest private-sector company in Venezuela [El Universal].  A progressive downturn in Venezuela's economy which had particular adverse on Aco's capital intensive businesses, resulted in a reorganization in 1994 under new leadership. Mannil was voted out as CEO so he left ACO and formed Oriand, with a portion of auto dealerships that had been part of Aco.&lt;ref name="Liivrand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattar"/&gt; At that time he had been the fourth largest shareholder, owning 20% of the company.&lt;ref name="Liivrand"/&gt; Männil continued to own Oriand [[Grupo Oriand]], until his death.

Männil was member of [[AEI World Forum]],&lt;ref name="nacion"/&gt; founded by president [[Gerald Ford]] whom Männil personally knew.&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slol-2000"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ohtuleht.ee/index.aspx?id=97704|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130213052820/http://www.ohtuleht.ee/index.aspx?id=97704|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 13, 2013|title=Peeter Ernits surub rikkaima eestlase kaante vahele|last=Michelson|first=Tarmo|date=October 18, 2000|newspaper=SL Õhtuleht|language=Estonian|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Männil visited Estonia for the first time since 1943 at the invitation of [[Vaino Väljas]], who he had met when Väljas was the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ambassador to Venezuela. At the time of the [[Singing Revolution|restoration of Estonian independence]] (1990–1992), during the governments of [[Edgar Savisaar]] and [[Tiit Vähi]],&lt;ref name=savisaar&gt;{{cite book |last= Savisaar |first= Edgar |title=Peaminister.

The club consisted of Estonian businessmen living abroad who gave economic advice and helped to explain Estonia's situation to Western nations. Männil was a godfather of Savisaar's daughter.&lt;ref name="savisaar"/&gt;

Near the end of 2002, Männil was forced to temporarily relocate to [[Costa Rica]] due to the [[Venezuelan general strike of 2002–2003|Venezuelan general strike]].&lt;ref name="kuulikindlaid"&gt;{{cite news|last=Luik|first=Selle|title=Männil toodab kuulikindlaid autosid|url=http://paber.ekspress.ee/viewdoc/08418D3371924A79C2256CAE005DC831|accessdate=30 August 2010|newspaper=Eesti Ekspress|date=January 15, 2003|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Männil's sons succeeded him when he retired from active business dealings in 2003.&lt;ref name="arileht"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arileht.ee/artikkel/330365|title=Lapsed valitsevad Harry Männili impeeriumi|date=2004-10-27|newspaper=Eesti Päevaleht|language=Estonian|accessdate=2009-10-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720125059/http://www.arileht.ee/artikkel/330365|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Männil died on January 11, 2010, in [[San José, Costa Rica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/486158|title=Suri väliseestlasest suurärimees Harry Männil|last=Masing|first=Kadri|newspaper=Eesti Päevaleht|language=Estonian|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes were placed in a chapel on his ranch located in the mountains of Costa Rica.&lt;ref name="AP-death"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ap3.ee/?PublicationId=3A7AB331-5884-4889-AC1D-80AFB1E7FBCE|title=Suri Harry Männil|last=Kald|first=Indrek|date=January 12, 2010|newspaper=Äripäev|language=Estonian|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art collecting and work as a cultural benefactor==
Männil was known as an [[art collector]] and cultural benefactor in several countries. His interest in art collecting first arose when he came into the possession of some works by [[Eduard Wiiralt]] during World War II.&lt;ref name="top200"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paber.ekspress.ee/arhiiv/Vanad/1997/35/maailm.html|title=Harry Männil maailma kunstikogujate eliidis|last=Liivrand|first=Harry|newspaper=Eesti Ekspress|language=Estonian|year=1997|issue=35|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Männil started collecting [[pre-Columbian art]] in 1957,&lt;ref name="top200"/&gt;  and eventually owned the largest private collection in Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Coronil"/&gt; His collection was regarded as among the 200 most important private collections by ''[[ARTnews]]'' magazine in 1997.&lt;ref name="top200"/&gt; Männil classified his art collection into three main groups: pre-Columbian art, modern [[Latin American art]], and art of the [[South American Indigenous people]]. He also possessed a few items of 17th–18th century colonial art.&lt;ref name="kuulikindlaid"/&gt; Männil, together with his wife, promoted the commercial production and marketing of the textile works of the [[Guajiro]] Indians. These two interests led to conflicts with local [[anthropologists]], who criticized their relationship with the Guajiro people and their means of building their archaeological collection.&lt;ref name="Coronil"/&gt;

On July 22, 2010, after Harry Männil's death, Costa Rican authorities raided his house in [[Heredia, Costa Rica|Heredia]] and seized 108 pieces of pre-Columbian art, including fourteen large [[stone spheres of Costa Rica|stone spheres]]. The family had been given two deadlines to hand over the objects voluntarily, and since that did not happen, a raid was conducted. Officials stated that the pieces had been obtained through an illegal purchase which had broken a law against trafficking in archaeological artifacts.

The Venezuelan government awarded him the [[Order of the Star of Carabobo]] and the [[Order of Francisco de Miranda]]. He received the [[Order of the Polar Star]] from the King of Sweden.&lt;ref name="11-kultuuritegelast"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.postimees.ee/?id=210947|title=11 kultuuritegelast ja poliitikut meenutavad Harry Männilit|date=January 12, 2010|newspaper=Postimees|language=Estonian|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hunterston Brooch''' is a highly important [[Celtic brooch]] of "pseudo-penannular" type found near [[Hunterston]], [[North Ayrshire]], Scotland, in either, according to one account, 1826 by two men from [[West Kilbride]], who were digging drains at the foot of Goldenberry Hill,&lt;ref name="lamb92"&gt;Lamb, page 92&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 92&lt;/ref&gt; It is now in the [[National Museum of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]].  Made within a few decades of 700 AD,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;NMS&lt;/ref&gt; the Hunterston Brooch is cast in silver, [[gilding|gilt]], and set with pieces of [[amber]] (most now missing), and decorated with [[interlace (art)|interlaced]] animal bodies in gold [[filigree]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The diameter of the ring is 12.2&amp;nbsp;cm, and in its centre there is a cross and a golden [[Halo (religious iconography)|Glory]] representing the Risen [[Christ]], surrounded by tiny bird heads.  The pin, which is broken, can travel freely around the ring as far as the terminals, which was necessary for fastening; it is now 13.1&amp;nbsp;cm long, but was probably originally 15&amp;nbsp;cm or more.&lt;ref name="Youngs, 91"&gt;Youngs, 91&lt;/ref&gt;  

The brooch may have been made at a royal site, such as [[Dunadd]] in [[Argyll]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; though is more likely to have been made in Ireland, especially as its [[pseudo-penannular]] form is typical of Irish brooches, whereas the truly penannular form remained usual in Pictish brooches.&lt;ref name="Youngs, 91"/&gt;  On the other hand, its style is closely comparable to a terminal fragment of a penannular brooch found in [[Dunbeath]] in 1860 which probably was made in Scotland; craftsmen may have travelled across the area using the locally popular forms.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 57&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd and Jennifer Laing feel it was probably made in [[Dalriada]], and the Museum of Scotland say "The style of the brooch has Irish parallels, while the filigree resembles metalwork from England. The brooch was probably made in western Scotland where the two traditions were joined, or perhaps in Ireland by a craftsman trained in foreign techniques."&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 148; [http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-100-036-198-C&amp;scache=1cnl3113a1&amp;searchdb=scran NMS database]&lt;/ref&gt;

The brooch has a complex construction typical of the most elaborate Irish brooches.  Panels of filigree work were created separately on gold trays, which were then fitted into the main silver-gilt body. On the reverse four panels of silver-gilt were also inserted; as in other examples like the [[Tara Brooch]] the decoration on the reverse uses older curvilinear "Celtic" motifs looking back to [[La Tène style]] Insular Celtic decoration, though on the Hunterston Brooch such motifs also appear on the front.&lt;ref name="Youngs, 91"/&gt; 

The back of the brooch has a scratched inscription in [[rune]]s in the [[Old Norse]] language, probably 10th century, "Melbrigda owns this brooch"; Maél Brigda, "devotee of [[Saint Bridgit|Bridgit]]" is a common Gaelic female name, though seen as male by other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, Tara Brooch, 215; Youngs, 91-92, "an Irishman Melbrigda".&lt;/ref&gt;  Much later ownership inscriptions are not uncommon on elaborate Celtic brooches, often from [[Norse-Gael]] contexts.  The Hunterston Brooch is clearly an object of very high status, indicating the power and great prestige of its owner.  With the [[Tara Brooch]] in [[Dublin]], and the [[Londesborough Brooch]] in the [[British Museum]], it is considered one of the finest of over 50 highly elaborate Irish Celtic brooches to survive,&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 90&lt;/ref&gt; and is "arguably the earliest of the ornate penannular brooches from Britain and Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 148&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3987">The '''Kunstraum of Lüneburg University''' is an institution for contemporary art working across different faculties of [[Lüneburg University]]. Since its renaming in 2007 the complete name is '''Kunstraum of Leuphana University Lüneburg'''.

== History ==

In 1993 the Kunstraum has been founded by a interdisciplinary group of researchers, which is up to today in charge for the academic and artistic projects. Members of this group are:

* Art historian [[Beatrice von Bismarck]] (since 1999 at the [[Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig]])
* Mathematician Diethelm Stoller (retired since 2005)
* Sociologist Ulf Wuggenig (currently the acting director of Kunstraum)

The official opening in 1994 coincided with the project '''Services''', which has been organized in collaboration with the art historian Helmut Draxler, at this time director of [[Kunstverein Munich]], and the artist [[Andrea Fraser]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afterall.org/journal/issue.35/responding-to-the-relations-and-conditions-of-exhibitions_the_services_working-group-discussion-foru&lt;/ref&gt; The program of the subsequent years has been influenced and inspired by writings of [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Nelson Goodman]], [[Thomas S. Kuhn]], and, amongst others, [[Howard S. Becker]] and included collaborations with artists and theoreticians accociated with [[Institutional Critique]].

===19th century===

*''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]'' ([[Nikolai Chernyshevsky]], 1863): written in prison in four months by a literary critic and radical, ''What Is To Be Done?'' advocates the creation of small socialist cooperatives based on the Russian peasant commune, but oriented toward industrial production. The author promoted the idea that the intellectual's duty was to educate and lead the laboring masses in Russia along a path to [[socialism]] that bypassed [[capitalism]]. The book inspired many [[Bolsheviks]], including [[Vladimir Lenin]], who wrote [[What Is To Be Done?|a pamphlet with the same title]] in 1901. However, it is not a masterwork of prose: Mark Schrad observed in ''Vodka Politics'' that "there is no real plotline or tension, and the environment and characters are stagnant. It has been called the worst novel ever written. Chernyshevsky himself even admitted that his novel contains neither talent nor art, but only “truth.”"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=rkRDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=%22worst+novel+ever%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BSPMX9rUsk&amp;sig=6nEEEoISh-JvzODV16ZR2_EOoac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjozcGzmerbAhWnCcAKHbzYCaw4ChDoAQhbMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=%22worst+novel+ever%22&amp;f=false|title=Vodka Politics: Alcohol, Autocracy, and the Secret History of the Russian State|first=Mark|last=Schrad|date=1 March 2014|publisher=OUP USA|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary critics panned it; Adam Weiner observed on [[Politico]] that "The [[tsar of Russia|czar]]’s censor had given the novel a pass, reasoning that the dreadful writing style would damage the revolutionary cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/russian-novel-chernyshevsky-financial-crisis-revolution-214516|title=The Most Politically Dangerous Book You’ve Never Heard Of|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/how-bad-writing-destroyed-the-world-9781501313134/|title=How Bad Writing Destroyed the World|first=|last=Bloomsbury.com|website=Bloomsbury Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[The Social War]]'' ([[Simon Mohler Landis]], 1872): a commercially unsuccessful [[utopian novel|utopian]] [[science fiction]] novel, ''The Social War'' was called by [[Jess Nevins]] in [[io9]] as "reprehensible trash, the most objectionable utopia of the 19th century, and the worst science fiction novel of that period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5890703/the-worst-science-fiction-novel-of-the-19th-century|title=The Worst Science Fiction Novel of the 19th Century|first=Jess|last=Nevins|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Irene Iddesleigh'' ([[Amanda McKittrick Ros]], 1897): published by the author's husband as an anniversary present, ''Irene Iddesleigh'' is often described as the worst novel ever written, with [[purple prose]] that is [[circumlocution|circumlocutory]] to the point of incomprehensibility. It was "popularised" by [[Barry Pain]] who called it "a thing that happens once in a million years." [[Mark Twain]] called it "one of the greatest [[unintentional humour|unintentionally humorous]] novels of all time," while the [[Inklings]] competed to see who could read one of Ros's works for the longest without laughter (cf. ''The Eye of Argon'' below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://litreactor.com/news/now-you-can-read-the-worst-novel-ever-written-for-free|title=Now You Can Read The Worst Novel Ever Written For Free!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Epic Fail'', Mark O'Connell wrote "Ros’ prose amounts to a sort of accidental [[surrealism]]. There is an intention toward [[metaphor]]—a lunge in the general direction of the literary—but an obvious misunderstanding of how such things work (and often, for that matter, how [[syntax]] works)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/01/was_amanda_mckittrick_ros_the_worst_novelist_in_history.html?via=gdpr-consent|title=Amanda McKittrick Ros, the Worst Novelist in History|first=Mark|last=O'Connell|date=23 January 2013|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/apr/19/worst-novelist-in-history|title=Is Amanda McKittrick Ros the worst novelist in history?|first=Alison|last=Flood|date=19 April 2013|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oddbooks.co.uk/amanda/irene.html|title=Irene Iddesleigh|date=9 June 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===

*''[[The Lair of the White Worm]]'' ([[Bram Stoker]], 1911): a horror novel revolving around a remote area of England haunted by a gigantic worm. The novel was badly received by historians of the horror genre. [[H. P. Lovecraft]], in his essay ''[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]'', stated that Stoker "utterly ruins a magnificent idea by a development almost infantile".&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Lovecraft, ''Supernatural Horror in Literature''. Reprinted in Stephen Jones &amp; Dave Carson (eds.) ''The World's Greatest Horror Stories''. New York : Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 2004.  {{ISBN|9780760754665}} (p.45)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Les Daniels]] criticised the "clumsy style" of the novel, and expressed disappointment that the author of the acclaimed ''[[Dracula]]'' could also write what Daniels regarded as a poor novel.&lt;ref&gt;Les Daniels, ''Living In Fear: a history of horror in the mass media'', New York: Scribner, 1975, {{ISBN|0684143429}}, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  The horror critic R.S. Hadji placed ''The Lair of the White Worm'' at number twelve in his list of the worst horror novels ever written.&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Hadji, "13 Worst Stinkers of the Weird", in ''[[Twilight Zone literature|Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone Magazine]]'', July–August 1983, TZ Publications, Inc., pp. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Stableford]] said it was "one of the most spectacularly incoherent novels ever to reach print".&lt;ref&gt;"Stoker, Bram" by [[Brian Stableford]] in [[David Pringle]], ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers''. London: St. James Press, 1998, {{ISBN|1558622063}}, (pp. 574).&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Mein Kampf]]'' ([[Adolf Hitler]], 1925): [[Autobiography]] and [[political treatise]] written in [[Landsberg Prison]] by [[Adolf Hitler]], then the leader of the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]]. Hitler posits a [[Antisemitic canard|Jewish conspiracy]] to gain world leadership, speaks of the evils of [[communism]], [[Marxism]], [[parliamentary democracy]], and of the need of the German people to seize ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space") from the [[Slavic peoples]] to the east. When Hitler gained control of Germany in the 1930s, the ideology expounded in ''Mein Kampf'' would lead to the [[Second World War]], the [[Holocaust]], and tens of millions of deaths. ''Mein Kampf'' has been described by many writers as the "most evil book in history,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/maiken-umbach/mein-kampf-new-edition|title=Mein Kampf: a new edition - History Today|website=www.historytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/mein-kampf-a-historical-tool-or-hitlers-voice-from-beyond-the-grave/2015/02/24/f7a3110e-b950-11e4-bc30-a4e75503948a_story.html|title=‘Mein Kampf’: A historical tool, or Hitler’s voice from beyond the grave?|first=Anthony|last=Faiola|date=24 February 2015|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a41090/hitler-mein-kampf-germany-return/|title=Hitler's Mein Kampf Is Coming Back to German Stores for the First Time in Decades|date=9 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/student-life/books/why-is-it-so-hard-to-get-a-copy-of-hitlers-mein-kampf-a6832986.html|title=Why is it so hard to get a copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its publication has been illegal or restricted in many countries since the defeat of Nazism in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/20/who-keeps-buying-all-these-mein-kampf-s|title=Who Keeps Buying All These ‘Mein Kampf’s?|first=Mark|last=Dery|date=20 March 2016|publisher=|via=www.thedailybeast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, contrary to popular belief, it was never illegal in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geschichtscheck.de/2016/11/23/ist-mein-kampf-in-deutschland-verboten/|title=Ist „Mein Kampf“ in Deutschland verboten? - GeschichtsCheck|website=www.geschichtscheck.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from its abhorrent politics, the book itself has been criticised for its writing style; Hitler's fellow [[fascist]] dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] called it "a boring tome that I have never been able to read" and called Hitler's views "little more than commonplace clichés."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=IWNEBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=a+boring+tome+that+I+have+never+been+able+to+read&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6em39URZj3&amp;sig=vbNJqg_eZEY8ZCTyDaYI0xK78RM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiktsyrxu_bAhUFM8AKHafSCiUQ6AEIPzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=a+boring+tome+that+I+have+never+been+able+to+read&amp;f=false|title=Hitler: Personal Recollections: Memoirs of Hitler From Those Who Knew Him|first=Heinz A.|last=Heinz|date=2 July 2014|publisher=Pen and Sword|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally McGrane of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote "Hitler’s seven-hundred-page screed [...] is so unreadable that, despite its ubiquity during the [[Third Reich]] [...] it is unlikely that most Germans actually cracked the book open. It is full of bombastic, hard-to-follow [[clause]]s, historical minutiae, and tangled ideological threads, and both [[neo-Nazis]] and serious historians tend to avoid it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/defusing-mein-kampf|title=Defusing “Mein Kampf”|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' ([[Ayn Rand]], 1957): [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] novel considered by Rand fans to be her [[magnum opus]], but widely criticised for "cardboard characters, over necessarily long speeches [and] absurd plotlines,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prairiefirenewspaper.com/2012/06/the-breathtakingly-bad-novels-that-changed-america-the-legacy-of-ayn-rand|title=The Breathtakingly Bad Novels that Changed America: The Legacy of Ayn Rand, Part One - Prairie Fire - The Progressive Voice of the Great Plains|website=www.prairiefirenewspaper.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whistlinginthewind.org/2014/03/14/atlas-shrugged-is-a-ridiculous-book/|title=Atlas Shrugged Is A Ridiculous Book|date=14 March 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its dubious moral messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2014/04/29/10_insane_things_i_learned_about_the_world_reading_ayn_rands_atlas_shrugged_partner/|title=10 (insane) things I learned about the world reading Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged”|date=29 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nathan Rabin]] summarized the book: "In Rand’s ''Atlas Shrugged'' [...], the richest and most powerful people in the world [...] go on strike because they feel underappreciated. Think about that for a second. They feel ''under''appreciated. They occupy the upper echelon of society, but for Rand, that isn’t not[sic] good enough. Not when there are so many mediocrities and sub-mediocrities pulling them down with their infernal demands to be treated with dignity and compassion." He also suggested that the philosophy of Objectivism can be viewed as an extreme opposite to [[communism]] and said "In Rand’s newfangled way of thinking, selfishness, or at least rational self-interest, was no longer a terrible moral failing, but rather a great moral good. It was the mighty engine that powered the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://film.avclub.com/heroically-self-interested-case-file-4-atlas-shrugged-1798228785|title=Heroically Self-Interested Case File #4: Atlas Shrugged: Part I|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|work=Film|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung]]'' ([[Mao Zedong]] and [[Lin Biao]], 1964): a collection of quotations from the then-dictator of the [[People's Republic of China]], published by the [[People's Liberation Army Daily]] and expounding [[Mao Zedong Thought]]. Named in 2005 by the [[Libertarian Alliance]] as the worst book ever written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-articles.org.uk/the_ten_worst_books_of_all_time.html|title=The Ten Worst Books of All Time (Part One)|website=www.la-articles.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Naked Came the Stranger]]'' (various authors, 1969): a collaborate effort by twenty-four journalists under the leadership of [[Mike McGrady]] as a criticism of contemporary American writing; McGrady believed that any book could succeed commercially if enough sex was thrown in, and to that end constructed a deliberately incoherent, badly written, sexually explicit novel. It indeed became a bestseller, and sales went up even more once the hoax was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthatsinteresting.com/naked-came-the-stranger|title=How A Bored Reporter Thought Up One Of The Greatest Literary Hoaxes Of All Time|date=15 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brillianceaudio.com/product?i=19729|title=Naked Came the Stranger  : Penelope Ashe|website=www.brillianceaudio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theawl.com/2012/06/naked-came-the-stranger-the-dirtiest-book-ever-written-by-a-group-of-newspaper-guys/|title='Naked Came The Stranger': The Dirtiest Book Ever Written By A Group Of Newspaper Guys|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[The Eye of Argon]]'' ([[Jim Theis]], 1970): a [[heroic fantasy]] [[novella]] notorious for [[purple prose]] and genre cliché; attempting to read ''The Eye of Argon'' out loud without laughing became a popular [[party game]] among fantasy readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.librarypoint.org/eye_of_argon|title=The Eye of Argon—Worst Story Ever Written? - Librarypoint|website=www.librarypoint.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.com/news/2008/oct/16/world-weird-web-em-eye-argonem/|title=World Weird Web: The Eye of Argon|website=www.independent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Worlds of Power|Worlds of Power: Metal Gear]]'' (Alexander Frost, 1990): a novelisation of the 1987 video game ''[[Metal Gear (video game)|Metal Gear]]'', it was described as possibly the worst book ever written by [[Den of Geek]]'s Luke McKinney: "This must have been a secret plot by [[Nintendo of America]] to destroy any interest in reading which may have lurked within loyal players. And this book is so bad it might cause your brain to forget how to read in self-defense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/metal-gear/248837/how-the-worst-metal-gear-book-ever-written-predicted-the-future-of-the-franchise|title=How the Worst Metal Gear Book Ever Written Predicted the Future of the Franchise|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Dazzle'' ([[Judith Krantz]], 1990): a [[romance novel]] set in [[Southern California]] in the 1980s, in which celebrity photographer Jazz Kilcullen negotiates life and love while contending with her half-sisters who aim to sell off her father's [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-12-29/lifestyle/9012280484_1_judith-krantz-sidney-sheldon-anne-rice/2|title=Critics May Take Her Lightly, But Krantz Can Dazzle Readers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] described ''Dazzle'' as the "[[vulgarity|vulgarest]]" novel he had ever read, and listed it among the 20 worst bestsellers of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/whats-the-worst-novel-ever-it-might-be-a-19th-century-novel-youve-never-heard-of/2018/08/21/702d50b2-a494-11e8-a656-943eefab5daf_story.html|title=Review - What’s the worst novel ever?

Her [[purple prose]] takes on ever deeper hues, and her customary parade of hyperbolic description is in constant evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-517-57501-7|title=Fiction Book Review: Dazzle by Judith Krantz, Author, Betty Prashker, Editor  Crown Publishing Group $21.95 (0p) ISBN 978-0-517-57501-7|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Left Behind (novel)|Left Behind: A Novel of the Earth's Last Days]]'' ([[Tim LaHaye]] and [[Jerry B.

''The Da Vinci Code'' was [[Criticism of The Da Vinci Code|widely criticized]] for its many factual inaccuracies and clumsy prose style. [[Salman Rushdie]] called it "a novel so bad that it gives bad novels a bad name," while [[Jodi Picault]] said "I don't understand the hype over such a poorly written novel - and as an author who does all her own research, I know better than to consider myself an expert in the field I am writing about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/08/jodi-picoult-da-vinci-code|title=Jodi Picoult attacks 'poorly written' Da Vinci Code|first=Alison|last=Flood|date=8 May 2009|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistics professor [[Geoffrey Pullum]] said "Brown's writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly, clumsily, thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/6194031/The-Lost-Symbol-and-The-Da-Vinci-Code-author-Dan-Browns-20-worst-sentences.html|title=The Lost Symbol and The Da Vinci Code author Dan Brown's 20 worst sentences|first=Tom|last=Chivers|date=15 September 2009|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=ocgmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Da+Vinci+Code%22+worst&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcnZefou3bAhWGOcAKHef6C9QQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Da+Vinci+Code%22+worst&amp;f=false|title=Umberto Eco, The Da Vinci Code, and the Intellectual in the Age of Popular Culture|first=Douglass|last=Merrell|date=5 June 2017|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of '''styles in [[house|residence]]''' construction.

This list predominantly refers to [[United States|American]] architectural styles. While there are many well preserved architectural styles across the United States, some older American houses have been renovated or additions have been constructed, often disguising their origins.  A Federal house may end up with Greek Revival and/or Queen Anne veneers.  It may also end up with vinyl siding, hiding all aspects of style except the basic structure.  To muddy the waters further, revival styles sometimes have revivals. The Queen Anne style was, itself, an adulteration of previous styles - a 19th-century version of Post-Modern.  Many homes will not fit into a single style category.  Thus, this list is not definitive, and lacks full representation of earlier prehistoric and historic times:

Dame [[Margot Fonteyn]], DBE (18 May 1919 – 21 February 1991), stage name of Margaret Evelyn de Arias, was an English ballerina. She spent her entire career as a dancer with the [[Royal Ballet]], eventually being appointed Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the company by Queen Elizabeth. She joined the [[Vic-Wells Ballet School]] at the age of 14 and from 1935 was the prima ballerina of the company, which would later be called the Sadler's Wells Ballet and the Royal Ballet. In 1959, though still tied to the Royal Ballet, she was allowed to perform as a freelance dancer to enable her work as a guest dancer with various international companies. Though she officially retired in 1979, she occasionally appeared as a dancer through the late-1980s.{{sfn|Percival|2008}}

[[File:Litema.png|thumb|Traditional Tema pattern with inversion and rotation of the model base]] 
'''Litema''' (pronounced: /ditʼɪːma/; also spelled ''Ditema''; Singular: '''Tema''', [[Sesotho]] for "text" or "ploughed land") is a form of [[Sotho-Tswana peoples|Sesotho]] [[mural]] art composed of decorative and symbolic geometric patterns, commonly associated with [[Sesotho]] tradition today practised in [[Lesotho]] and neighbouring areas of South Africa. Basotho women generate litema on the outer walls and inside of homesteads by means of engraving, painting, relief mouldings and/or mosaic. Typically the geometric patterns are combed or scratched into the wet top layer of fresh clay and dung plaster of the wall, and later painted with earth ochers or, in contemporary times, manufactured paint. Patterns most often mimic ploughed fields through a combed texture, or the patterns refer to plant life, and more occasionally to other aspects of the natural world, such as referring to clan totem animal. Litema are transient; they may desiccate and crumble or be washed away by heavy rain. It is common for women of an entire village to apply litema on such special occasions as a wedding or a religious ceremony.&lt;ref name="gerdes-the-sotho-lithema-tradition"&gt;Paulus Gerdes: ''On Mathematical Ideas in Cultural Traditions of Central and Southern Africa''. In: Helaine Selin (Hrsg.): ''Mathematics across cultures''. New York 2001, S. 329–332.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
As Gary van Wyk (1993:84) pointed out in his analysis of the etymology of the Sesotho noun denoting "Sesotho mural art," ''litema'' also refers to the associated concepts of "ploughed lands", &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bukantswe.sesotho.org/display.php?action=search&amp;word=ploughed+land&amp;type=full |title=Bukantswe dictionary search "ploughed land" |publisher=bukantswe.sesotho.org |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the decorative tradition is symbolically linked to cultivation in many ways. It is derived from the verb stem ''-lema'' (in the [[infinitive]], ''ho lema'' "to cultivate"), which is a reflex of the [[Proto-Bantu language|Proto-Bantu]] root ''*-dɪ̀m-'' "to cultivate (esp. with hoe)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goto.glocalnet.net/jfmaho/pbapp.pdf |title=Select Proto-Bantu Vocabulary |publisher=linguistics.africamuseum.be |date=29 May 2005 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[orthography|orthographic]] &lt;l&gt; in ''li-'' ([[Sesotho nouns#nc 10|Class 10]] [[noun class]] prefix for [[Sesotho nouns]]) is pronounced [d] in Sesotho since [d] is an [[allophone]] of /l/ occurring before the close vowels, /i/ and /u/. The orthographic &lt;e&gt; can have three possible values in Sesotho:  /ɪ/, /ɛ/, and /e/. In &lt;litema&gt; is pronounced /ɪ/, as per the Proto-Bantu root.

==Design==
The litema patterns are characterised by a multi-stage [[symmetry (geometry)|symmetry]]. Patterns are generally arranged in square cells. A wall to be shaped is divided into a grid to form the cells. Each cell is applied with the same pattern, which is usually rotated or mirrored from cell to cell. The symmetry of the overall pattern thus depends on the symmetries present in the basic pattern. There are designs with only one mirror axis in the basic patterns that result in an overall impression of flowing in one direction. Other basic patterns have several axes of symmetry or a [[rotational symmetry]], and give the overall pattern a rather flat ornamental impression. The colour design is restrained, usually only two colours are used&lt;ref name="gerdes-the-sotho-lithema-tradition" /&gt;

==History==
The tradition of mural art in Southern Africa is not of recent origins. While excavations at Sotho-Tswana archaeological sites have revealed hut floors that have survived the elements for as much as 1500 years, the earliest evidence of Sotho-Tswana mural painting stretches back about five centuries (Grant 1995:45 ; Van Wyk 1998:88). It long predates the tradition of Ndebele mural painting that has been globaly popularized. Begun in the 19th century, the [[Southern Ndebele people|Ndzundza Ndebele]] mural art tradition called ''igwalo'' (more widely known as [[Ndebele house painting]]), is said to be a synthesis of a [[Pedi people|Northern Sotho]] ''ditema'' tradition and the [[Nguni people|Nguni]] design traditions employed in beadwork, pottery and basket weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/role-decoration-ndebele-society |title=The role of decoration in Ndebele society |publisher=www.sahistory.org.za |date=1 January 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial record===

One of the earliest written accounts of Basotho mural art is by the missionary Rev. John Campbell. In his 1813 description of Batlhaping ([[Tswana people|South Tswana]]) art, Campbell stated the following:"Having heard of some paintings in Salakootoo's house, we went after breakfast to view them. We found them very rough representations of the camel-leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, lion, tiger, and stein-buck, which Salakootoo's wife had drawn on the clay wall, with white and black paint. However, they were as well done as we expected, and may lead to something better" (Grant 1995:43).

On his second journey in 1820, Campbell, gave an enthusiastic account of what he saw at the house of a certain chief "Sinosee" of the Hurutse lineage of the Sotho-Tswana. Campbell provided both illustrations as well as a verbal description of the chief's house: "The wall was painted yellow, and ornamented with figures of shields, elephants and camel-leopards, etc. It was also adorned with a neat cornice or border painting of a red colour...its walls (of Sinosee's bedroom) were decorated with delightful representations of elephants and giraffes… In some houses there were figures, pillars, etc moulded in hard clay and painted with different colours that would not have disgraced European workmen" (Van Wyk 1996:43; 1998:88).

Campbell's accounts were compiled and published by historian George Stow, in his book ''The Native Races of South Africa'' (1905). Stow also published the earliest known drawings of litema – reproductions of eight designs made by the "[[Koena tribe|Bakuena]]" (the founding clan of the [[Basotho]] nation), which he likely drew himself, based on an unpublished letter by Stow in the South African Library in which he recounts visiting a ruined Bakoena kraal (Van Wyk 1998:89). Stow's drawings showed textured panels similar to litema engravings still made today as well as painted patterns of dots, stripes, triangles, and zigzags executed in limited colors. 

In his 1861 book, the French missionary Eugene Casallis recalled the litema patterns he had experienced since settling among Basotho in the 1830s, calling the designs "ingenious", which suggests designs more intricate than the Bakoena examples Stow reproduced (Van Wyk 1998:89). Stow's documentation did not include any designs incorporating plant motifs like those seen in modern-day litema. Van Wyk (1994) suggests that the more modern and "intricate curvilinear designs have a distinctly Victorian or Edwardian flavor that was probably influenced by such turn-of-the-century European products as linoleum patterns, cast-iron moldings and lace". 

===Contemporary Revival===

Almost a century separates Stow's drawings from those done in 1976 by students of the Lesotho National Teachers Training College (Van Wyk 1989:89). Benedict Lira Mothibe, an art lecturer at the college at the time, instructed students to copy litema designs for the purposes of using these in classroom geometry lessons and as copies for potato prints. More importantly, it was an attempt by Mothibe to revive interest in what he considered a worthwhile Sesotho tradition. Gary van Wyk employed these drawings during his extensive field research in South Africa and Lesotho from 1991-1994, recording women's responses to the historical patterns, including the names and meanings they ascribed to them, and later republished several of the drawings. He found that although many of the specific vegetal patterns (e.g. "melons") that had been named in the 1970s had been forgotten by the 1990s and subsumed under a general descriptive category of "blomme", the Afrikaans word for "flowers," nonetheless this designation maintained the close symbolic association between women and vegetative fertility, linked to women's traditional roles as cultivators and foragers. Furthermore, a few patterns recorded by Mothibe were still identifiable and being produced in the early 1990s, such as one that refers to the board for marabaraba, a popular indigenous game like checkers (1998:90-91).   

More recently (2003), Mothibe, in a further contribution towards the cause of preservation, compiled and donated a second edition on litema designs entitled ''Basotho Litema Patterns (With Modifications)'' to the School of Design Technology and Visual Art of the [[Central University of Technology]], [[Free State (province)|Free State]], providing an updated record of designs and their interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.cut.ac.za/litema/historical.html |title=Historical Record |publisher=portal.cut.ac.za/litema |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==

Research conducted by Van Wyk and Mathews in the late-1980s and mid-1990s, culminating in two photographically illustrated books titled ''African Painted Houses: Basotho Dwellings of Southern Africa'' (Van Wyk, 1998) and ''The African Mural'' (Chanquion &amp; Matthews, 1989)), suggests that the art of litema cannot be understood in purely aesthetic terms. 

In several works on this topic, Gary Van Wyk (1993, 1994, 1996, 1998) states that Sesotho murals are a form of religious art, appeals to the ancestors for the rain that delivers the fertility that nourishes the fields and thereby sustains the herds and the human community. Murals, he says, can be seen as prayers in paint. If the ancestors are satisfied, they provide rain that washes away the murals, and the cycle of life begins anew. It is fitting that murals are produced by women, who are symbolically linked to the house, which is a metaphor of the womb and of creation, and to the vegetal realm to which women are linked through their traditional roles as cultivators and foragers, and through several other vegetal symbols. The Basotho creation myth, for example, states that the nation emerged from a dark place deep in the earth through a bed of reeds; accordingly it was once customary upon the birth of child inside the earthen house, originally built in an igloo shape, and therefore womb-like, to place a reed in the doorway of the home until the child "crossed the reed" to emerge into the light of day (Van Wyk 1998: 103-107). Similarly, female initiates wear a reed mask, and during their initiation confinement they weave reed mats. 

This symbolic link between the igloo-shaped house and the body later was transferred to modern rectangular homes with flat roofs, where the surrounds of doorways and windows were particularly ornamented, and the name for the litema patterns along the roofline was the "headband". 

"The fecundity of fields and of women is celebrated in the creation of radiant blooms, unfurling fronds, spiralling tendrils and sprouts...Because agricultural labor was traditionally women's work, women who decorate houses can be viewed as picturing this work in the fields upon their walls. The murals are thus African landscapes, composed of the very landscape they represent"(Van Wyk 1994). This is most apparent in litema patterns that consist solely of uncolored combing into mud: these closely mimic the appearance of a plowed field. 

Van Wyk found that red ocher, called ''letsoku'', or "the blood of the earth", symbolized fertility and the blood of both menstruation and sacrifice, underscoring the key link between the ancestors and fertility and accounting for the fact that red ocher is invariably incorporated into every painting scheme. White symbolized the calm, purity and enlightenment that the ancestors promote and desire, while black represented the dark rain clouds that the ancestors deliver if all is calm and well, and these two colors are frequently combined in dense, alternating patterns applied to transitional zones of the architecture, such as the roofline and around doors and windows. Similarly, such patterns elements as triangles and zigzags likely also carried symbolic meanings that have become obscured in recent times. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Van Wyk also photographed murals that expressed political statements, using the colors of the banned African National Congress during the apartheid era, or incorporating specific political graphics or statements. 
	
Tom Mathews in his writings (supported by photographs taken by his son Paul Chanquion) stated that flowers and dots were symbols of fertility. Furthermore, he states that chevron patterns represent water or uneven ground whilst triangles are symbols denoting male and female (Changuion &amp; Matthews, 1989:9,19,55).

In the study conducted by the [[Central University of Technology|CUT]], no persons knowledgeable in the art of litema (Bekker, Thabane and Mothibe) or practising litema artists had any knowledge of a deeper significance other than that of beautifying the home for aesthetic purposes. Some of the artists questioned did however share their opinions concerning the possibility of symbolic meaning. According to artists in the Free State, their mothers (many of whom originate from Lesotho), might have been aware of such meanings, but did not share this information with them during their teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.cut.ac.za/litema/symbolism.html |title=Litema Symbolism |publisher=portal.cut.ac.za/litema |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing System===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ditema tsa Dinoko.jpeg|thumbnail|right|"Ditema tsa Dinoko" written in the writing system of that name]] --&gt;
One popular commentator has claimed that litema represent an ancient Basotho [[logographic]] writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zulumathabo.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/ditema-tsa-basotho-writing-system |title=Ditema Tsa Basotho Writing System |publisher=zulumathabo.wordpress.com |date=1 March 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated above, it is probable that there has always been a symbolic logic associated with litema (perhaps comparable to the tradition of [[Adinkra symbols]] in West Africa), but there is little evidence to assert the historical existence of a formal logography of the kind represented in [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]] or [[Chinese characters]].

Nevertheless, there is indeed a contemporary [[writing system]] (specifically, a [[featural]] syllabary) associated with litema, that can be used to write Sesotho (and all other [[Southern Bantu]] languages). It is called ''[[Ditema tsa Dinoko]]'' ("Ditema syllabary") and is also known by its [[Zulu language|Zulu]] name, ''Isibheqe Sohlamvu'', and various other related names in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isibheqe.org |title=IsiBheqe |publisher=isibheqe.org |date=23 August 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.org.za/LSSASAALASAALT-ConferenceProgramme2015.pdf |title=Isibheqe Sohlamvu: An Indigenous Writing System for Southern Bantu Languages |publisher=linguistics.org.za |date=22 June 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quillwork''' is a form of [[textile]] embellishment traditionally practiced by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] that employs the [[quill]]s of [[porcupine]]s as an aesthetic element. Quills from bird feathers were also occasionally used in quillwork.

==History==
[[File:Upper MO quillwork pre1804 UPenn.jpg|thumb|Backside of loomed quillwork collected from an [[Plains Indians|Upper Missouri tribe]] by the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], pre-1804. All [[natural dyes]]. Collection of the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]]]]
Porcupine quillwork is an art form completely unique to North America. Before the introduction of glass beads, quillwork was a major decorative element used by the peoples who resided in the porcupine's natural habitat,&lt;ref name="worldtex"&gt;Gillow and Sentance 223&lt;/ref&gt; which included [[indigenous peoples of the Subarctic]], [[indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeastern Woodlands]], and [[Northern Plains]]. The use of quills in designs spans from [[Maine]] to [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name="Orchard"&gt;Orchard&lt;/ref&gt; Quillworking tools were discovered in [[Alberta, Canada]] and date back to the 6th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin 265&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cheyenne]] [[oral history]], as told by Picking Bones Woman to George Bird Grinnell, says quilling came to their tribe from a man who married a woman, who hid her true identity as a buffalo. His son was also a buffalo. The man visited his wife and son in their buffalo home, and, while among the buffalo, the man learned the art of quilling, which he shared with the women of his tribe.&lt;ref name="Penney and Horse Capture, 119"&gt;Penney and Horse Capture 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Joining the Cheyenne Quilling Society was a prestigious honor for Cheyenne women. Upon entering the Society, women would work first on quilling [[Moccasin (footwear)|moccasins]], then [[cradle board|cradleboards]], rosettes for men's shirts and [[tipi]]s, and ultimately, hide robes and backrests.&lt;ref name="Penney and Horse Capture, 119"/&gt;

Porcupine quills often adorned [[rawhide (textile)|rawhide]] and tanned hides, but during the 19th century, [[Wiigwaasi-makak|quilled birch bark boxes]] were a popular trade item to sell to European-Americans among Eastern and Great Lakes tribes. Quillwork was used to create and decorate a variety of Native American items, including those of daily usage to Native American men and women. These include clothing such as coats and moccasins, accessories such as bags and belts, and furniture attachments such as a cradle cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Christina|last2=Herald|first2=Susan|year=2010|title=The History and Analysis of Pre-Aniline Native American Quillwork Dyes|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=tsaconf|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings|volume=|pages=|via=Digital Commons@University of Nebraska-Lincoln}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[Image:Quill knife sheath.png|thumb|left|140px|A quillwork knife sheath.]]
Quills suitable for embellishment are two to three inches long and may be dyed before use.&lt;ref name="worldtex" /&gt; In their natural state, the quills are pale yellow to white with black tips. The tips are usually snipped off before use. Quills readily take dye, which originally was derived from local plants and included a wide spectrum of colors, with black, yellow, and red being the most common. By the 19th century, aniline dyes were available through trade and made dying easier.&lt;ref&gt;Feest 138&lt;/ref&gt;

The quills can be flattened with specific bone tools or by being run through one's teeth. Awls were used to punch holes in hides, and [[sinew]], later replaced by European thread, was used to bind the quills to the hides.

The four most common techniques for quillwork are [[Applique|appliqué]], [[embroidery]], wrapping, and [[loom]] weaving.&lt;ref&gt;Feest 215&lt;/ref&gt; Appliquéd quills are stitched into hide in a manner that covers the stitches.&lt;ref name="worldtex" /&gt;  In wrapping, a single quill may be wrapped upon itself or two quills may be intertwined.&lt;ref name="worldtex" /&gt;

Quills can be appliquéd singly to form curvilinear patterns, as found on [[Odawa people|Odawa]] pouches from the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent 15&lt;/ref&gt; This technique lends itself to floral designs popularized among [[indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|northeastern tribes]] by [[Ursulines|Ursuline nuns.]] [[Wyandot people|Huron]] women excelled at floral quillwork during the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent 24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plains Indians|Plains]] quillwork is characterized by bands of rectangles creating geometrical patterns found also in Plains painting.&lt;ref&gt;Feest 140&lt;/ref&gt; Rosettes of concentric circles of quillwork commonly adorned historical Plains men's shirts, as did parallel panels of quillwork on the sleeves. These highly abstracted designs had layers of symbolic meaning.

The [[Pembina Band of Chippewa Indians|Red River Ojibwe]] of [[Manitoba]] created crisp, geometric patterns by weaving quills on a loom in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent 28 and 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
[[File:Ferdy's dragonfly.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary quillwork design on [[birch bark]], by Ferdy Goode]]

Quillwork never died out as a living art form in the Northern Plains. Some communities that had lost their quillwork tradition have been able to revive the art form. For instance, no women quilled in the [[Dene]] community of [[Wha Ti, Northwest Territories]] by the late 1990s. The Dene Cultural Institute held two workshops there in 1999 and 2000, effectively reviving quillwork in Wha Ti.&lt;ref&gt;Marie and Thompson, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The art form is very much alive today. Examples of contemporary, award-winning quillworkers include [[Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty]], ([[Sioux]]-[[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]]) artist;&lt;ref&gt;Durbin 279 and 304&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy Brave Eagle ([[Oglala Lakota]]) of [[Denver, Colorado]];&lt;ref&gt;Melmer, David.

'''Resist dyeing''' ('''resist-dyeing''') is a traditional method of [[dyeing]] [[textile]]s with patterns.  Methods are used to "[[resist]]" or prevent the dye from reaching all the cloth, thereby creating a pattern and ground. The most common forms use [[wax]], some type of paste made from starch or mud,&lt;ref name="BGAfrica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Batik in Africa |url=http://www.batikguild.org.uk/historyAfrica.asp | publisher=The Batik Guild| accessdate=April 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a mechanical resist that manipulates the cloth such as tying or stitching.  Another form of resist involves using a chemical agent in a specific type of dye that will repel another type of dye [[textile printing|printed]] over the top.  The best-known varieties today include [[tie-dye]] and  [[batik]].

==Basic methods==
'''Wax or paste''': melted [[wax]] or some form of paste is applied to cloth before being dipped in dye. Wherever the wax has seeped through the fabric, the dye will not penetrate. Sometimes several colors are used, with a series of dyeing, drying and waxing steps. The wax may also be applied to another piece of cloth to make a [[stencil]], which is then placed over the cloth, and dye applied to the assembly; this is known as '''resist printing'''.

'''Stencils''': a [[stencil]] is placed over the fabric where it is to be shielded from ink, similar to how [[screenprinting|screen prints]] are made.

'''Mechanical''': the cloth is tied, stitched, or clamped using clothespegs or wooden blocks to shield areas of the fabric.

'''Chemical''':  a modern textile printing method, commonly achieved using two different classes of fiber [[reactive dyes]], one of which must be of the vinyl sulfone type.  A chemical-resisting agent is combined with dye Type A, and printed using the [[screenprint]] method and allowed to dry.  A second dye, Type B, is then printed overtop.  The resist agent in Type A chemically prevents Type B from reacting with the fabric, resulting in a crisp pattern/ground relationship.&lt;ref name="chemicalresist"&gt;{{cite web |title = Vinyl Sulfone Fiber Reactive Dyes: Using Remazol Dyes for Chemical Resist Dyeing |url=http://www.pburch.net/dyeing/remazol.shtml#chemicalresist
|publisher=All About Hand Dyeing |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate = April 13, 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Resist dyeing has been very widely used in Eurasia and Africa since ancient times. The first discoveries of pieces of linen was from Egypt and date from the fourth century. Cloth, used for mummy wrappings, was coated with wax, scratched with a sharp stylus, and dyed with a mixture of blood and ashes. After dyeing the cloth was washed in hot water to remove the wax. In Asia, this technique was practiced in China during the T'ang dynasty (618–907), in India and Japan in the Nara period (645–794). In Africa it was originally practiced by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Soninke and Wolof in Senegal.&lt;ref name="BGAfrica"/&gt;

==Traditions using wax or paste==
* [[Guizhou|Guizhou Province]] of China had a strong tradition of wax dyeing

[[Image:Roketsuzome printing wheels.jpg|thumb|200px|Rōketsuzome printing wheels at Roketsuzome Yamamoto, [[Kyoto]].]]
* [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[India]] – [[Batik]] with wax
* [[Japan]] – [[Rōketsuzome]] with wax, [[Katazome]], Yūzen and [[Tsutsugaki]] with rice-paste
* [[Africa]] – Yoruba people of [[Nigeria]] uses cassava paste as a resist while the people of [[Senegal]] use rice paste. Among other terms, [[Madiba shirt|Madiba]].&lt;ref name="BGAfrica"/&gt;

==Traditions using tying or stitching==
* [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] – [[Ikat]], where only the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] or [[weft]] is dyed (article covers similar techniques elsewhere).
* [[India]]
* Africa – [[Adire (textile art)|Adire]] 
* Modern West – [[Tie-dye]]
* Japan – [[Shibori]]

==Traditions using printing==
* [[Japan]]- [[Katazome|Katagami]] and [[Bingata]] with stencils
* [[China]] – about 500 AD  the ''jia xie'' method for dyeing (usually silk) using wood blocks was invented.  An upper and a lower block is made, with carved out compartments opening to the back, fitted with plugs. The cloth, usually folded a number of times, is inserted and clamped between the two blocks. By unplugging the different compartments and filling them with dyes of different colours, a multi-coloured pattern can be printed over quite a large area of folded cloth.&lt;ref name="cave"&gt;Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas" , 1990, British Museum publications, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Sally Cruikshank was born in [[Chatham, New Jersey|Chatham]], [[New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=countsp40 /&gt; the daughter of parents Rose and Ernest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://funonmars.blogspot.com/2008/12/more-party.html "More Party"], Cruikshank blog, December 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were both [[Southern United States|Southerners]], with her father, an [[accountant]] who worked in nearby [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], holding a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] key from [[Duke University]], in [[North Carolina]]. Ernest's mother had been the president of the boarding school formerly known as [[Saint Mary's School (Raleigh, North Carolina)|St. Mary's College]] in that state.&lt;ref name=dixon208&gt;Dixon, Wheeler Winston, ed. ''Collected Interviews: Voices from Twentieth-Century Cinema.'' [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], [[Illinois]] : Southern Illinois University Press, 2001, p. 208. {{ISBN|0-8093-2417-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruikshank has a brother,&lt;ref&gt;[http://funonmars.blogspot.com/2009/11/10-little-indians.html "10 Little Indians"], Cruikshank blog, November 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and had a sister, Carol,&lt;ref&gt;[http://funonmars.blogspot.com/2008/11/july-17-1958-from-carol.html "July 17, 1958 from Carol"], Cruikshank blog, November 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; who died in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://funonmars.blogspot.com/2008/12/out-of-here.html "Out of here"], Cruikshank blog, December 05, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Their maternal aunt, Bea, was a painter from the 1910s to the 1940s, whose work included a portrait commission by [[US President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://funonmars.blogspot.com/2008/09/auntie-beas-portrait-of-my-sister.html "Auntie Bea's portrait of my sister"] at Cruikshank blog, September 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Cruikshank studied art at [[Smith College]],&lt;ref name=countsp40&gt;Counts, Kyle. "The Short Life of Sally Cruikshank", ''Starlog Presents Comics Scene'' &lt;!--Title as on cover logo and postal indicia both--&gt; #7, January 1982, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; where in her junior year art teacher [[Elliot Offner]] sent slides of her colored-pencil and clay-relief-on-paper drawings to a screening committee that resulted in a scholarship to the two-month [[Yale University|Yale]] Summer Art School. At the urging of a classmate there, Warner Wada, she began considering adapting her drawing style to animation.&lt;ref name=countsp40-41&gt;Counts, pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Smith for her senior year and obtaining the primer ''Animation'' by [[Preston Blair]], Cruikshank, with additional research, arranged for a special-studies class in animation. With an animation stand consisting of a [[Bolex]] camera attached to a photo enlarger, constructed by instructor David Batchelder, she produced her first [[animated short]], the three-minute, [[16mm]] "Ducky".&lt;ref name=countsp40-41 /&gt; Done with [[watercolor]] and paper animation, it starred a prototype version&lt;ref name=countsp41&gt;Counts, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; of her future recurring character Quasi, which one writer characterized as "an infantile duck with buck front teeth, thick glasses and a red cape".&lt;ref name=countsp43&gt;Counts, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Cruikshank, describing her [[anthropomorphic]] characters, said, "My ducks are based on the ducks from [[Carl Barks]]' comics. But I guess they  got twisted in memory, because people don't seem to see much similarity between them."&lt;ref name=countsp41 /&gt;

Encouraged by the response of "Ducky", Cruikshank, after graduation, enrolled at the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], to study filmmaking. Under instructor [[Larry Jordan]], she made the five-minute animated short "Fun on Mars" (1971), which used watercolor, [[crayon]] markers on paper, [[Cutout animation|cutouts]], and [[collage]]. Produced for $100, it also featured early versions of her trademark duck-creatures. Her next short, "Chow Fun" (1972), created with a $400 grant secured in association with [[PBS]], mixed paper animation and cutouts glued onto [[animation cel]]s.&lt;ref name=countsp41 /&gt;

==="Quasi at the Quackadero"===
While editing "Chow Fun" at San Francisco's Snazelle Films, a [[Sponsored film|commercial-film]] company that also rented out space and film equipment, Cruikshank, at an employee's suggestion, showed her work to company president E. E. Gregg Snazelle, who gave her a job a week later "to experiment in animation and do [[TV commercial]]s when there was work".&lt;ref&gt;Counts, pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of summer 1972, Cruikshank was head animator there.&lt;ref name=countsp42&gt;Counts, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she recalled of her time with Snazelle,
{{quote|The job was to experiment with animation, and do commercials for him when the jobs came in. He also hoped I'd figure out how to solve [[3-D film|3-d]] without glasses. Needless to say I didn't solve 3-d. I didn't even do very many commercials over ten years, but I showed up at 8:30, took an hour off for lunch and worked till 5:30. I was paid $350 a month, and I could live on that then. He encouraged me generously without ever paying much attention to me. These days if an opportunity like that even existed, you'd be forced to sign all kinds of rights statements for characters and content created, but this was before ''[[Star Wars]]'' and he just seemed to be happy to have me around. We were never particularly close. It spoiled me for any job after that. I made all my 'Quasi' films while I was working at Snazelle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://funonmars.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2010-02-17T17%3A36%3A00-07%3A00&amp;max-results=20 "Quasi's Big Day"], Cruikshank blog, December 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Quasi at the Quackadero (1975) sample frame.jpg|thumb|300px|Still from 6:49 of Cruikshank's signature work, "[[Quasi at the Quackadero]]", depicting Anita and Quasi at left.]] In 1975 Cruikshank made a comic strip based on her characters Anita and Quasi, which was published in the third issue of the underground comics magazine [[Arcade (comics magazine)|Arcade]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/cruikshank_sally.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

At Snazelle, Cruikshank began developing her best-known work, "[[Quasi at the Quackadero]]" (1975), [[working title]]s of which included "I Walked with a Duck", "Hold That Quasi", and "Quasi Quacks Up".&lt;ref name=countsp42 /&gt; The 10-minute, [[35mm]] short, with 100 watercolor backgrounds and approximately 5,000 cels, took two years for Cruikshank to draw, followed by four months for photography and [[post-production]].&lt;ref name=countsp42 /&gt; Cruikshank independently financed&lt;ref name=countsp44&gt;Counts, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; the $6,000 budget, which went primarily for cel painting, [[sound recording]] and lab and camera work. [[Underground comix|Underground cartoonist]] [[Kim Deitch]], then Cruikshank's boyfriend, did much of the [[inker|inking]], using dip pen and [[rapidograph]], with Kathryn Lenihan doing most of the cel painting.&lt;ref name=countsp42 /&gt; The short starred Quasi, voiced by Deitch; Anita, which one writer described as "[[Betty Boop]] with a [[New wave music|New Wave]] wardrobe" and whose [[Mae West]]-like voice was supplied by Cruikshank; and robot Rollo.&lt;ref name=countsp43 /&gt; They progress through the Quackadero, a [[Coney Island]]-esque sideshow with such attractions as the Hall of Time Mirrors, which depict the viewer as he or she will look in "old age" or "100 years from now", and the Time Holes, in which one can lean on a railing and see a live slice of three million years [[Before Christ|B.C.]] unfold.&lt;ref&gt;Counts, p. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; The music, by the [[Berkeley, California]] band the [[R. Crumb &amp; His Cheap Suit Serenaders|Cheap Suit Serenaders]], used slide flute, xylophone, ukulele, duck call, boat whistle and bagpipe to create what Cruikshank called the "strange, gallopy feeling" of 1920s/1930s dance-band music, of which she is a devotee.&lt;ref name=countsp45&gt;Counts, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

"Quasi at the Quackadero" won awards and was shown at the [[Filmex|Los Angeles Film Exposition]], and made its first theatrical booking at the Northside Theater in Berkeley,&lt;ref name=countsp44 /&gt; not far from Cruikshank's home at the time at 1890 Arch Street in that city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://funonmars.blogspot.com/2009/12/letter-from-jan-18-1981.html "A letter from Jan. 18, 1981"], Cruikshank  blog, December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other early projects===
Cruikshank's next short, the eight-minute, 35mm "Make Me Psychic" (1978; working title "Mesmeroid Madness") returns Quasi and Anita and adds the suave Snozzy. Built around a device that taps into one's latent telekinetic power, leading to [[slapstick]] at a party, the $14,000 film also was financed by Cruikshank, with the higher budget going toward the hiring of additional cel painters and increased lab fees. Of its slicker look than her previous short, Cruikshank said, "People didn't know what to make of 'Quasi.' It was pretty hard to absorb in one sitting, solid. So, I thought I would try directing the eye more, by simplifying things and giving the next film a clearer focus."&lt;ref name=countsp44 /&gt; The Cheap Suit Serenaders again supplied music.&lt;ref name=countsp45 /&gt;

In 1980, Cruikshank won a $10,000 grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to create a [[storyboard]] and three-minute sample reel for a proposed [[animated feature]], ''Quasi's Cabaret'', which she described as involving "three hedonistic ducks who try to open the ultimate tropical nightclub."&lt;ref name=countsp45 /&gt; She also tried developing feature projects combining live action and animation, one a comedy set in a [[mental institution]], the other, ''Joystick'', "sort of a humorous horror story" about the effects of computer animation on an artist modeled on herself. Additionally, she attempted to sell [[Cable television in the United States#Programming|cable-TV network]]s on "Weird Airways", a projected series of three-minute shorts starring Snozzy as the owner-pilot of a [[charter airline]] and Anita as a [[flight attendant]].&lt;ref name=countsp45 /&gt;

===Later work and life===
Cruikshank evolved a recognizable style with [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] and [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] elements. Her film "Face Like a Frog" (1987) bears a musical score by [[Oingo Boingo]], with the group's [[Danny Elfman]] singing his song "Don't Go in the Basement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funonmars.com/portfolio.html Portfolio: "Face Like a Frog"] at Fun on Mars (official site)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruikshank has contributed [[animation]] sequences to [[feature films]], including ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983) and ''[[Top Secret!]]'' (1984), as well as the opening [[title sequence]]s to ''[[Ruthless People]]'' (1986), ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1987), ''[[Loverboy (1989 film)|Loverboy]]'' (1989), ''[[Madhouse (1990 film)|Madhouse]]'' (1990), and ''[[Smiley Face (film)|Smiley Face]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://funonmars.blogspot.com/2009/03/smiley-face-titles.html "Smiley Face Titles"], Cruikshank blog, March 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She has also worked in commercials and [[Web site|website]] design. Cruikshank also animated and produced many music videos for ''[[Sesame Street]]'' from 1989-1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funonmars.com/resume.html Resume] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711054918/http://www.funonmars.com/resume.html |date=2011-07-11 }} at Fun on Mars (official site)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--These include the shorts "Above It All"&lt;ref&gt;[http://funonmars.blogspot.com/2009/02/wonderful-emails.html "Wonderful emails"], Cruikshank blog, February 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and ________________--&gt;

For a short time in the 1990s, Cruikshank was employed by the Palo Alto laboratory and technology incubator [[Interval Research Corporation]] as an animator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Landekic|first=Lola|title=Sally Cruikshank: A Career Retrospective, Part 2|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/sally-cruikshank-a-career-retrospective-part-two/|publisher=ArtOfTheTitle.com| date=May 27, 2015 |accessdate=June 23, 2015| archivedate= June 23, 2015| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150623020115/http://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/sally-cruikshank-a-career-retrospective-part-two/ | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruikshank is in the process, as of 2011, of transferring her works into 35mm film format, for archival purposes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://funonmars.blogspot.com/2011/11/obsolete-formats.html "Obsolete Formats"], Cruikshank blog, November 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, several 35mm prints of her work were screened at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Personal life==
Cruikshank was in a decade-long [[common-law marriage]] with [[Underground comix|underground cartoonist]] [[Kim Deitch]] during the period 1971–c. 1982.&lt;ref name=DeitchTCJ&gt;Deitch, Kim.

==Influences and style==
Cruikshank prefers the early [[New York City]] animation of such producers as the [[Fleischer Studios]] and the [[Van Beuren Studios]], as well as early [[Bob Clampett]].&lt;ref name=countsp45 /&gt; In a 1981 interview, she said of her own style at the time, 
{{quote|I think I have a different concept of motion than most other animators. One thing that bothers me about so many contemporary animators is that they've learned a language from other animators. You see the same hand movements, the same 'blink' 'blink' 'blink' when a character asks a question. Too many animators don't try to picture the dynamics of movement, to use it creatively. I'm not that great an animator per se, but I do think I have a sense of motion that makes for an offbeat view of the world.&lt;ref name=countsp45 /&gt;}}

==Animated short films==
* "Ducky" (1971)
* "Fun on Mars" (1971)
* "Chow Fun" (1972)
* "[[Quasi at the Quackadero]]" (1975)
* "Make Me Psychic" (1978)
* "Quasi's Cabaret Trailer" (1980)
* "Face Like a Frog" (1987)

Several other short films are on Cruikshank's [[YouTube]] channel.

==Awards and honors==
In 1986, Cruikshank won the initial [[Maya Deren Award]] for independent film and video artists, given by the [[American Film Institute]], along with [[Stan Brakhage]] and [[Nam June Paik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1986-02-01/entertainment/ca-3164_1_independent-film | title = AFI Gives 1st Award For Independent Film Makers | date = February 1, 1986 | last = Taylor | first = Clarke | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6CTliWCu5?url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-02-01/entertainment/ca-3164_1_independent-film | archivedate = November 27, 2012 | deadurl = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shusha Realni School''' was a school with six classes, located in Shusha, Azerbaijan. The school's building phase was completed in 1881.

==History==
In the 19th century, new types of schools began to appear in Azerbaijan. During this period, there was only one main school in Baku, and one classical gymnasium in Ganja. This changed after the demand for education in the region grew, two schools were no longer sufficient thus prompting the population of the city to appeal to the Petersburg-Caucasian committee. The appeal stated:
 {{cquote|''"Ganja governor requests to open a sixth-grade real school in Shusha city, based on the willingness and demand of the residents to study (Studying more than 400 students at City School reaffirms this initiative once more) and the desire of the city community. The city community is committed to providing the school with the appropriate building and helping with 7500 manats a year. "''}}

The efforts of the local population led led to the foundation of the school in Shusha on September 20, 1881. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title= Cənubi Qafqazın ən qədim məktəbi|url= http://kaspi.az/az/cenubi-qafqazin-en-qedim-mektebi/?action=disablemobile |website= kaspi.az |accessdate=30 January 2018|language=Azerbaijani}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the first years of the school's opening, 159 pupils were enrolled in the school, consisting of preparatory classes and three main classes, 58 of the students were Azerbaijani, 91 were Armenian, whilst the other 10 were student from other nationalities. In 1886, 7,500 manats were spent on the school.

In 1890, a representative of the Caucasian Ministry of education brought Ziaaddovla Anishirəvan, Mirza Qajar, and anthropologist Shantr. This arrival peaked the interest of the students, which lowered the percentage of absence at the school to 7.64%. The school was an open-minded establishment which promoted the acquisition of languages other than Azerbaijani. In 1890, contrary to the Tbilisi schools, German was not forced upon the students, but the choice to learn it was made available. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title= Böyük elm ocağı Şuşa Realnı Məktəbi |url= https://news.milli.az/culture/136296.html |website= news.milli.az|accessdate=30 January 2018|language=Azerbaijani}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mirza Salah bey Zohrabbeyov, Yusif bey Malikhaqnazarov, Hashim bey Vazirov, were part of the well-known educators of the time, who taught in the School. The two famous Azerbaijani writers [[Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev]] and [[Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli]] were amongst the students who enrolled at the Shusha Realni School.

'''Spex''' is a form of amateur [[comedy]] theatre act performed by university students in [[Sweden]] and parts of [[Finland]]. University cities, such as [[Gothenburg]], [[Lund]], [[Uppsala]], and [[Linköping]] have long-running traditions of spex. The word is likely derived from abbreviated student slang for ''spektakel'' (spectacle; scene; show).&lt;ref name="linkop"&gt;{{cite web|website=Linkopings Student Spex|title=Spex in English|accessdate=2 May 2017|url=https://www.studentspex.se/spex-in-english/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=2/16/69540.html ''Svenska Akademins Ordbok'' entry: ''Spex'']   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525130504/http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=2%2F16%2F69540.html |date=May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of comedy theatre may also be known as '''Gyckel''' (buffoonery), when performed at a [[Gask]].

==History==
The first spexes were performed possibly as early as the 16th century in [[Uppsala]]. Local students were practising Latin by writing short plays in Latin, called spexes. These performances were performed by male-only casts, as all the students at that time were male,&lt;ref name="linkop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="holger"/&gt; and the tradition of gender switching for roles continues today.&lt;ref name="holger"/&gt; Over the next 300 years the spexes developed into their modern form, which emerged around 1850 at [[Uppsala University]].&lt;ref name="holger"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.holgerspexet.se/info/english|website=Holger Spexet|accessdate=2 May 2017|title=What is Spex?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first spexes in Finland were performed at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teekkarispeksi.fi/speksi/historia "The History page of Teekkarispeksi" entry: ''Spex'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Spexes are always [[amateur drama|amateur productions]], written and performed by students, and often have a historical theme.&lt;ref name="linkop"/&gt; 
Other prominent features of spexes are the [[Musical theatre|musical]]-like mix of song (mostly popular hits with new parodic lyrics) and dialogue (often featuring rhyme), and heavy use of satire and parody.&lt;ref name="linkop"/&gt;

One of the distinguishing features of spex as opposed to other forms of theatre is the central prominence of audience participation.&lt;ref name="linkop"/&gt; The audience have established lines, shouting "Restart!" (Swedish: Omstart!/Omtag!) or "One more time!" (Swedish: En gång till!) if they consider the current scene to be of particularly high quality. The actor is then expected to improvise the scene or punchline in a new way. There are also several other commands that the audience can give, such as demanding that the actors should perform the current scene backwards, in slow-motion, or in another language.

While spexes are typically in Swedish or Finnish, at least all Physicist Spex (Fyysikkospeksi, [[Aalto University]], Finland) productions to date have been translated into English for a visiting performance in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The English translation is now also performed in Finland, to provide the unusual event of a spex aimed specifically at an audience of English-speaking students.

==Gyckel==
When performed at a [[Gask]], this form of theatre may be known as ''Gyckel'' or ''jyckel''. A gyckel typically involves a group of students singing a song or performing a play lasting no more than a few minutes. There are several unwritten rules, such as that the gyckel must have been written by the performers and be presented for the first time at the gask. The gyckel should also feature [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] and/or sexist humor.

At a gask with guests from different faculties it is usually expected that each faculty performs its own gyckel. Others may also report that they will be performing a gyckel to the [[toastmaster]], who will then announce when the time has come for a certain group to perform their gyckel.

'''Stjepan Filipović''' (27 January 1916 &amp;ndash; 22 May 1942) was a [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] communist who led ''Kolubara Company of the Valjevo Partisan Detachment'' during the 1941 [[Uprising in Serbia (1941)|Partisan uprising]]. He was captured and executed in 1942 in [[Valjevo]]. The photo of him taken shortly before the execution has become a symbol of resistance against fascism in the Second World War. He was proclaimed [[Order of the People's Hero|People's Hero of Yugoslavia]] in 1949.

==Biography==
[[File:Mladi Stjepan Filipović.jpg|left|thumb|Young Stjepan Filipović (right)]]
[[File:Stjepan Filipović.JPG|right|thumb|Monument to Filipović in Valjevo]]
Stjepan Filipović was born on 27 January 1916 in [[Opuzen]] (modern-day [[Croatia]]) as fifth child in the family of Anton and Ivka Filipović. The Filipović family moved throughout the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], so he lived in [[Županja]], [[Mostar]] and [[Kragujevac]]. In Kragujevac, he studied locksmithing and mastered the basics of electrical wiring, carpentry and bookbinding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starosajmiste.info/blog/stjepan-filipovic-heroj-radnicke-i-antifasisticke-borbe-70-godina-od-smrti/&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the labour movement in 1937, but he was arrested in 1939 and sentenced to a year in prison. He joined the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] in 1940.

Filipović was commander of the Partisans' Tamnavsko-Kolubarski unit in [[Valjevo]] (modern-day [[Serbia]]) by 1941. He was captured on 24 February 1942 by [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] and hanged in [[Valjevo]] on 27 May 1942, aged 26. As the rope was put around his neck, Filipović defiantly thrust his hands out and shouted "Smrt fašizmu, sloboda narodu!" which translates as "[[Death to fascism, freedom to the people]]!". He urged the Yugoslav people to resist and implored them to never cease resisting. At this moment, a photograph was taken which has since become famous, and from which a statue of Filipović was cast.&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Bosnia'', Cathie Carmichael, Cambridge University Press, 2015 {{ISBN|1107016150}}, 9781107016156 page 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Upton; Sagarin, Edward; Teichnerhe, Albert; ''Cry for Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest'', p. 438; L. Stuart, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

Filipović was declared a National Hero of Yugoslavia on 14 December 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Richard; ''The Blue Butterfly: Selected Writings'' p. 144; Salt, 2006, {{ISBN|1-84471-258-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Valjevo has a statue dedicated to him, "''Stevan'' Filipović". A monument was also erected in his home town of Opuzen in 1968, but was demolished in 1991; reconstruction is planned by the Croatian [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Dubrovnik/tabid/75/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/116498/Default.aspx | language = Croatian | title = Pao partizan - Antifašisti će tužiti opuzensku vlast | date = 2010-09-24 | accessdate = 2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Dubrovnik/tabid/75/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/120526/Default.aspx | language = Croatian | newspaper = [[Slobodna Dalmacija]] | title = Srušeni heroj - Stjepan Filipović vraća se u centar Opuzena | date = 2010-11-06 | accessdate = 2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war his two brothers Nikola and Šimun Filipović also died.

The '''talus''' is an architectural feature of some [[late medieval]] [[castles]], especially prevalent in [[Crusades|crusader]] constructions. It consists of a [[Batter (walls)|battered]] (sloping) face at the base of a [[Fortification|fortified wall]]. The slope acts as an effective defensive measure in two ways. First, conventional siege equipment is less effective against a wall with a talus. [[Escalade|Scaling ladders]] may be unable to reach the top of the walls and are also more easily broken due to the bending stresses caused by the angle they are forced to adopt. [[Siege towers]] cannot approach closer than the base of the talus, and their [[Corvus (weapon)|gangplank]] may be unable to cover the horizontal span of the talus, rendering them useless. Furthermore, defenders are able to drop rocks over the walls, which will shatter on the talus, spraying a hail of [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] into any attackers massed at the base of the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''tertiary color''' is a color made by mixing full saturation of one primary color with half saturation of another primary color and none of a third primary color, in a given [[color space]] such as [[RGB color model|RGB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = How Video Works | author = Marcus Weise and Diana Weynand | publisher = Focal Press | year = 2007 | ISBN = 0-240-80933-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KGbFAYGt5qsC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22tertiary+color%22++rgb&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=egQlSMaZM5TstgOal_m9DQ&amp;sig=Z8nS3gwQNshO57wThW611DC2z8o#PPA58,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] (more modern) or [[RYB color model|RYB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Art and Science of Professional Makeup | author = Stan Place and Bobbi Ray Madry | publisher = Thomson Delmar Learning | year = 1990 | ISBN = 0-87350-361-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tG2ncjtg_lYC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;dq=%22tertiary+color%22++red-yellow-blue&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=OwYlSIK2GI3itAOh4rjEDQ&amp;sig=sL8j3zZHN6aWyDUgUAFHh764I3I }}&lt;/ref&gt; (traditional).

Tertiary colors have general names, one set of names for the RGB color wheel and a different set for the RYB color wheel. These names are shown below.

Another definition of tertiary color is provided by color theorists such as Moses Harris&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Natural System of Colours | author = Moses Harris | publisher = Laidler | year = 1766 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Colours-Facsimile-Perhaps-Literature/dp/B000KS0NZE }}&lt;/ref&gt;and Josef Albers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Interaction of Color | author = Josef Albers | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1963 | ISBN = 0-300-01846-0 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Interaction-Color-Revised-Josef-Albers/dp/0300018460/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;, who suggest that tertiary colors are created by intermixing pairs of [[secondary color]]s: orange-green, green-purple, purple-orange; or by intermixing [[complementary color]]s. This approach to tertiary color relates specifically to color in the form of paints, pigments and dyes. 

==RGB or CMY primary, secondary, and tertiary colors==
[[File:RBG color wheel.svg|thumb|300px|Primary, secondary, and tertiary colors of the RGB (CMY) color wheel.]]
The primary colors in an RGB color wheel are [[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]], because these are the three [[additive color]]s—the primary colors of light. The secondary colors in an RGB color wheel are [[cyan]], [[magenta]], and [[yellow]] because these are the three [[subtractive color]]s—the primary colors of pigment.

The tertiary color names used in the descriptions of [[RGB]] (or equivalently [[CMYK]]) systems are shown below.

==Traditional painting (RYB)==
[[File:Color star-en (tertiary names).svg|300px|thumb|A traditional [[RYB color model|RYB]] color wheel.]]
The primary colors in an [[RYB color model|RYB]] color wheel are [[red]], [[yellow]], and [[blue]]. The secondary colors — [[Orange (colour)|orange]], [[green]], and [[purple]] — are made by combining the primary colors.

In the [[RYB color model|red–yellow–blue system]] as used in traditional painting and interior design, tertiary colors are typically named by combining the names of the adjacent primary and secondary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Human Evolution Coloring Book | author = Adrienne L.

===Tertiary- and quaternary-color terms===
{{anchor|Tertiary and quaternary color words}}
The terms for the RYB tertiary colors are not set. For the six RYB hues intermediate between the RYB primary and secondary colors, the names [[amber (color)|amber]]/marigold (yellow–orange), [[vermilion]]/cinnabar (red–orange), [[magenta]] (red–purple), [[violet (color)|violet]]/indigo (blue–purple), [[teal (color)|teal]]/aqua ([[blue-green]]), and [[chartreuse (color)|chartreuse]]/lime green (yellow–green) are commonly found. The names for the twelve quaternary colors are more variable, if they exist at all, though [[indigo]] and [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]] are standard for blue–violet and red–vermilion.

In another sense, a tertiary color is obtained by mixing secondary-colored pigments. These three colors are [[russet (color)|russet]] (orange–purple), [[slate gray|slate]] (purple–green), and [[citron (color)|citron]] (green–orange), with the corresponding three quaternary colors [[plum (color)|plum]] (russet–slate), [[sage (color)|sage]] (slate–citron), [[buff (colour)|buff]] (citron–russet) (with [[olive (color)|olive]] sometimes used for either slate or citron).&lt;ref&gt;William J. Miskella, 1928, ''Practical Color Simplified: A Handbook on Lacquering, Enameling, Coloring And Painting'', pp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lemos, 1920, "Color Charts for the School Room", in ''School Arts'', vol. 19, pp 580–584&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond that are shades of grey (blue grey and brown greys), which approach but never quite reach black.

The RYB color terminology outlined above and in the color samples shown below is ultimately derived from the 1835 book ''Chromatography'', an analysis of the RYB color wheel by [[George Field (chemist)|George Field]], a chemist who specialized in pigments and dyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Maerz and Paul | title = A Dictionary of Color | location = New York | date = 1930 | page = 154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of RGB and RYB color wheels==
Unlike the RGB (CMY) color wheel, the RYB color wheel has no scientific basis. The RYB color wheel was invented centuries before the 1890s, when it was found by experiment that magenta, yellow, and cyan are the primary colors of pigment, not red, yellow, and blue.

The RGB (CMY) color wheel has largely replaced the traditional RYB color wheel because it is possible to display much brighter and more saturated colors using the primary and secondary colors of the RGB (CMY) color wheel. In the terminology of [[color theory]], [[RGB color model|RGB color space]] ([[CMYK color model|CMY color space]]) has a much larger [[color gamut]] than [[RYB color model|RYB color space]].

[[File:Lambs before Lambs Club 1915.jpg|thumb|400px|The Lambs on June 27, 1915 at 130 West 44th Street]]
'''The Lambs, Inc.''' (aka '''The Lambs Club''') is a social club in [[New York City]] for actors, songwriters, and others involved in the [[theatre]].  It is America's oldest theatrical organization. "The Lambs" is a registered trademark of The Lambs, Inc.; and the club has been commonly referred to as The Lambs Club and The Lambs Theater since 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-lambs.org/disclaimer.htm |title=The Lambs |date= |accessdate=2014-12-31 |quote=The Lambs, Inc., is America's oldest professional theatrical club. ... The Lambs ® is a registered trademark of The Lambs, Inc., and has been known as The Lambs club for over 137 years. ... |publisher=The Lambs |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1868 The Lambs was founded in [[London]] by actors, led by [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]], the first Shepherd, looking to socialize with like-minded people. Several of those, most notably [[Henry James Montague]], came to the [[United States]] and formed The Lambs of New York during Christmas week of 1874. It was incorporated in 1877 in [[New York City]]. Shortly afterward the London Lambs closed.

The club's name honors the essayist [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]] and his sister [[Mary Lamb|Mary]], who during the early 19th century played host to actors and [[Intellectuals|literati]] at their famed [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] in London.&lt;ref name="Hardee"&gt;Hardee, Lewis J., Jr., [https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ujp_4nUEkC ''The Lambs Theatre Club''], Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland Publishing, 2010 [2006]. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-6095-3}}. A book about the history of The Club. The Lambs was recognized on May 9, 2008, by the Mayor of New York City, [[Michael Bloomberg]].([http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6095-3 publisher's summary])&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 they celebrated their [[golden jubilee]] at the [[Earl Carroll Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Fifty Years of The Lambs |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06E3DE163FE733A2575BC0A9609C946595D6CF# |quote=The Lambs, New York's famous actors' club, will celebrate its golden jubilee with a public Gambol at the Earl Carroll Theatre tonight. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=June 8, 1924 |accessdate=2014-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lambs, the [[New York Friars' Club]] and [[The Players (New York City)|The Players in New York]] are often confused. In 1964 long-time syndicated columnist [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] put it this way: "Long ago a New Yorker asked the difference between the Lambs, Friars, and Players, since the membership was, at the time, predominantly from Broadway." It was left to "a wit believed to have been [[George S. Kaufman]]" to draw the distinction: "The Players are gentlemen trying to be actors, the Lambs are actors trying to be gentlemen, and the Friars are neither trying to be both."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Wilson| first =Earl| authorlink =| title =Earl Wilson’s New York| publisher =Simon &amp; Schuster| year =1964| location =New York| pages =49–50| url =| doi =| id =| isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidents==
The president of The Lambs is called "The Shepherd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-lambs.org/board.htm |title=Governance |date= |accessdate=2014-12-31 |quote= |publisher=The Lambs |location= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131220915/http://www.the-lambs.org/board.htm |archivedate=2015-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Club displays the portraits of all its presidents, painted by artists such as [[James Montgomery Flagg]] and [[Everett Raymond Kinstler]].

The Lambs has had many Manhattan homes since 1874, beginning with Delmonico's Restaurant in Union Square. Then in 1875 they met at the Maison Doree on the south side of 14th St. opposite Union Square; 1876–77 next to Wallack's theater at 848 Broadway; 1877–78 at the Union Square Hotel, 6 Union Square; 1879 within a brownstone at 19 East 16th St.; 1880–91 at a Brownstone at 34 West 26th St.; 1891 at the Gilsey House, 1200 Broadway; 1892 at 8 West 29th St.; 1893–96 at 26 West 31st St.; 1897–1905 at 70 West 36th St., what was formerly and thereafter [[Keens Steakhouse|Keen's Chophouse]] remodeled by [[Stanford White]] to be a clubhouse; in 1905 at 128–130 West 44th St., in a house designed by Stanford White, then doubled in size in 1915.

Until 1974 the Club remained at the building at 128 West 44th St. The building was also designed by Stanford White, and was erected in 1904&amp;ndash;1905; it expanded in 1915 to include 132 West 44th St. When the club relocated to its current nine-story quarters at 3 West [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st St.]] adjacent to [[Rockefeller Center]], it sold its own quarters to the [[Church of the Nazarene]] which intended to use the old building as a mission in [[Times Square]].&lt;ref name="NYT2006"&gt;Robertson, Campbell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/02/theater/02lamb.html "Lamb's Theater Company Receives Eviction Notice"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The church leased part of the building for what would become the [[Off Broadway]] [[Lamb's Theatre]] which is not related to the Club except for the name of the building.

The building was designated a New York City Landmark&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/LAMBS-CLUB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in September 1974; and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on June 3, 1982.

In 2006 the Church of the Nazarene sold the building and theatre, which has been renovated by the Chatwal Hotel. They operate a restaurant in the hotel and named it The Lambs Club, although there is no relation between the hotel and The Lambs other than what was left of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Sifton, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html "Retro Glamour Made New: Restaurant Review: The Lambs Club"].  ''[[The New York Times]]''.  October 26, 2010 Accessed January 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activity==
The Lambs, Inc., is still active in its nine-story quarters at 3 West [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st St.]] adjacent to [[Rockefeller Center]]. Its members have been instrumental in the formation of [[ASCAP]], [[Actors' Equity]] and [[Actors’ Fund|The Actors' Fund of America]], Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and in the merger that created [[SAG-AFTRA]]. Of the first 21 Council members of Actors' Equity, 20 were members of The Lambs. The meetings to form Actors' Equity were held at The Players, a club similar to The Lambs, because there were too many producer members of The Lambs.  The Actors' strike of 1919 was settled in The Lambs, which was referred to as "Local One."

Historically, The Lambs has been the spawning ground of plays, friendships and partnerships. ''[[Mark Twain Tonight]]'' (with [[Hal Holbrook]]) and ''[[Stalag 17]]'' were first performed at The Lambs prior to their national successes.

[[Alan J. Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]] first met at The Lambs, often trying works-in-progress on their fellow Lambs. Loewe left a percentage of his share of [[Brigadoon]] royalties to The Lambs' Foundation. Since its founding, there have been more than 6,000 Lambs including [[Spencer Tracy]],&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZxE5CUHIUoC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=lambs+spencer+tracy#v=onepage&amp;q=lambs%20spencer%20tracy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Astaire]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[George M. Cohan]], [[W.C. Fields]], [[Will Rogers]], [[John Philip Sousa]], [[Conrad Nagel]],  [[Fred Waring]] and [[Albert Hague]], and [[Cliff Robertson]], [[Abe Vigoda]] and [[Ken Howard]]. Current members include [[Joyce Randolph]] of "The Honeymooners," [[Jim Dale]], [[Matthew Broderick]] and Tony Award-winning conductor/arranger [[Donald Pippin (Broadway director)|Donald Pippin]]. The Lambs' website contains a listing of its past members.

The '''treasure guardian''' is a recurring [[motif (narrative)|motif]] in [[folklore]] of a being that guards a treasure.

The '''''Venus of Martres''''' is a sculpture fragment from an antique replica of the [[Aphrodite of Knidos]]. The replica was made around the first century of the common era. It is on display at [[Musée Saint-Raymond]] in [[Toulouse]], France.

== History ==
The Venus of Martres was discovered in 1826 at [[Chiragan villa]] in [[Martres-Tolosane]]. It is currently on display on the first floor of Musée Saint-Raymond as exhibit Ra 52 (formerly Inv. 30328).

== Description ==
The Venus of Martres consists in a marble head in good general condition, although the tip of the nose if damaged. The shape of the neck indicates it might have been part of a bust or of a full-size statue. The hair is held in place by a ribbon that circles the head twice and shapes it into a bun. The face is slightly asymmetrical.
[[File:Vénus de Martres (de face, gros plan), MSR, Musée Saint-Raymond.png|thumb|Vénus de Martres (de face, gros plan), MSR, Musée Saint-Raymond]]
In his 1828 catalogue&lt;ref&gt;Dumège, 1828, pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandre Du Mège|Alexandre Dumège]] identifies the fragment as representing Venus:
{{quote|Imitation of the greatest perfection that nature produced, and ideal beauty itself, could not depict in more admirable forms this goddess whom Lucretius named delight of men and gods&lt;ref&gt;in the original, painful French: ''L'imitation de la nature dans ce qu'elle a produit de plus parfait , et le beau idéal même, n'auraient pu représenter sous de plus admirables formes , cette déesse que Lucrèce a nommé la Volupté des Hommes et des Dieux.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1865, [[Ernest Roschach]]&lt;ref&gt;Roschach, 1865, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; instead identifies it to a depiction of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]:
{{quote|It might as well be seen as Diana. It even seems that the proud beauty of the face and the energic development of the neck muscles would rather justify this attribution and hint at the chaste goddess, accustomed to running in the woods and take deep inbreaths of the fotrifying air of the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;In original French: ''On en pourrait aussi bien en faire une Diane. Il semble même que la beauté fière du visage et l'énergique développement des muscles du cou justifie plutôt cette dernière attribution et trahissent la chaste déesse, habituée à courir les bois et à respirer à pleins poumons les brises fortifiantes des montagnes.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)"''', called '''"Waka Waka (Esto es África)"''' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], is a song by [[Colombia]]n singer [[Shakira]], featuring the [[South Africa]]n band [[Freshlyground]]. It was released on 7 May 2010 by [[Epic Records]] as the official song of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], which was held in South Africa. Written, composed, and produced by Shakira and [[John Hill (record producer)|John Hill]], "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" is a [[Pop music|pop]] song whose lyrics encourage one to aim for their goals like a soldier on a battlefield. The song was adapted from the [[Cameroonian people|Cameroonian]] band [[Golden Sounds]]'s 1986 song "[[Zamina mina (Zangalewa)|Zangaléwa]]." The song initially generated controversy after numerous South Africans expressed disappointment in [[FIFA]]'s decision to select Shakira to sing the song, arguing that a native artist should have been assigned the role.

It garnered generally favourable reviews from critics, receiving praise for its production. "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" peaked at number one on [[record charts]] of numerous countries including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Switzerland. In the United States, the song peaked at number 38 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and was later [[Record certification|certified]] [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for selling over one million units in the country. The single similarly attained multi-platinum certifications in other countries, including a nine-times platinum certification in Sweden and a six-times platinum certification in Spain. "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" has sold 15 million downloads worldwide, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles]] of all time.

The [[music video]] for "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" was directed by [[Marcus Raboy]] and shows Shakira and a group of dancers and children dancing to the song together. It features cameos by various footballers like [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and [[Lionel Messi]]. It became popular on [[YouTube]], receiving 2.1 billion views as of November 2018 and becoming the [[List of most-viewed YouTube videos|twenty-fifth most-watched video of all time]] on the site. Shakira performed the song at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony]] on 10 June as well as at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|closing ceremony]] on 11 July. It was also included on the set list of her [[The Sun Comes Out World Tour]] (2010–11) and [[El Dorado World Tour]] (2018).

In February 2010, Shakira wrote and produced "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" with [[American people|American]] record producer [[John Hill (record producer)|John Hill]], who had previously collaborated with her on several songs from ''[[She Wolf]]''. The inclusion of [[Freshlyground]], a [[South African people|South African]] Afro-[[Fusion (music)|fusion]] band, on the track came to take place after Hill met with their producer in New York. The band were finishing their studio album ''Radio Africa'' when Hill approached them requesting for input regarding the song. The producer left the band alone to make additions to the track and returned hours later to listen to it. Giving little reaction after hearing it, Hill expressed interest in recording "everything I'd heard here" and told the band that they would hear from him later.&lt;ref name=developmentfreshlygroundreformer&gt;{{cite web|last=Madeloni|first=Dave|title=Freshly Ground rides ‘Waka Waka’ wave|url=http://www.reformer.com/ovation/ci_18334737?source=email|work=[[Brattleboro Reformer]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|accessdate=20 February 2014|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=freshlygroundinterviewcapemag&gt;{{cite web|last=Scharges|first=John|title=Freshlyground talks about Shakira, soccer and success|url=http://www.capetownmagazine.com/freshlyground|publisher=Cape Town Magazine|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Pop music|pop]] song, "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" draws inspiration from traditional African music and blends an [[African Colombian]] rhythm with a [[Soca music|Soca]]-influenced beat. It contains instrumentation from a Southern African guitar.&lt;ref name=fifaannouncementsony /&gt; The chorus of the song and the words "waka waka" are borrowed from "[[Zamina mina (Zangalewa)|Zangaléwa]]," a 1986 song recorded by [[Cameroonian people|Cameroonian]] band [[Golden Sounds]], which was a hit not only across Africa but also in Shakira's native country, Colombia.&lt;ref name=originalzangelewanyt&gt;{{cite web|last=Mackey|first=Robert|title=Shakira Remixes African Hit for World Cup|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/24/shakira-remixes-african-hit-for-world-cup/?ref=soccer|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=16 March 2014|date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Debora Halbert, author of the book ''The State of Copyright: The Complex Relationships of Cultural Creation in a Globalized World,'' Golden Sounds are not the original creators of the chorus too, since it has been adapted from "military marches of unknown origins that go back as far as [[World War II]]."&lt;ref name=copyrightbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Halbert|first=Debora|title=The State of Copyright: The Complex Relationships of Cultural Creation in a Globalized World|date=5 February 2014|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-3178-1743-7|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MnXMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=Waka+Waka+shakira&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9A4HU7e1J4K4rgeeooDgAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
