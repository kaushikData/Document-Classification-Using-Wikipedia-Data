      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9439">In [[control theory]] '''Advanced process control''' (APC) refers to a broad range of techniques and technologies implemented within industrial process control systems.  Advanced process controls are usually deployed optionally and in addition to ''basic'' process controls.  Basic process controls are designed and built with the process itself, to facilitate basic operation, control and automation requirements.  Advanced process controls are typically added subsequently, often over the course of many years, to address particular performance or economic improvement opportunities in the process.

[[Process control]] (basic and advanced) normally implies the process industries, which includes chemicals, petrochemicals, oil and mineral refining, food processing, pharmaceuticals, power generation, etc.  These industries are characterized by continuous processes and fluid processing, as opposed to discrete parts manufacturing, such as automobile and electronics manufacturing.  The term [[process automation]] is essentially synonymous with process control.

Process controls (basic as well as advanced) are implemented within the process control system, which may mean a [[Distributed control system|distributed control system (DCS)]], [[Programmable logic controller|programmable logic controller (PLC)]], and/or a supervisory control computer.  DCSs and PLCs are typically industrially hardened and fault-tolerant.  Supervisory control computers are often not hardened or fault-tolerant, but they bring a higher level of computational capability to the control system, to host valuable, but not critical, advanced control applications.  Advanced controls may reside in either the DCS or the supervisory computer, depending on the application.  Basic controls reside in the DCS and its subsystems, including PLCs.

== Types of Advanced Process Control ==

Following is a list of well known types of advanced process control:

* Advanced regulatory control (ARC) refers to several proven advanced control techniques, such as override or adaptive gain (but in all cases, "regulating or feedback").  ARC is also a catch-all term used to refer to any customized or non-simple technique that does not fall into any other category.  ARCs are typically implemented using function blocks or custom programming capabilities at the DCS level.  In some cases, ARCs reside at the supervisory control computer level.
* Advanced process control (APC) refers to several proven advanced control techniques, such as feedforward, decoupling, and inferential control.  APC can also include Model Predictive Control, described below. APC is typically implemented using function blocks or custom programming capabilities at the DCS level.  In some cases, APC resides at the supervisory control computer level.
* Multivariable [[Model predictive control]] (MPC) is a popular technology, usually deployed on a supervisory control computer, that identifies important independent and dependent process variables and the dynamic relationships (models) between them, and often uses matrix-math based control and optimization algorithms to control multiple variables simultaneously.  One requirement of MPC is that the models must be linear across the operating range of the controller. MPC has been a prominent part of APC ever since supervisory computers first brought the necessary computational capabilities to control systems in the 1980s. 
* Nonlinear MPC: Similar to Multivariable MPC in that it incorporates dynamic models and matrix-math based control; however, it does not have the requirement for model linearity. Nonlinear MPC is capable of accommodating processes with models that have varying process gains and dynamics (i.e. dead-times and lag times).
* Inferential Measurements: The concept behind inferentials is to calculate a stream property from readily available process measurements, such as temperature and pressure, that otherwise might be too costly or time-consuming to measure directly in real time.  The accuracy of the inference can be periodically cross-checked with laboratory analysis.  Inferentials can be utilized in place of actual online analyzers, whether for operator information, cascaded to base-layer process controllers, or multivariable controller CVs.  
* Sequential control refers to discontinuous time- and event-based automation sequences that occur within continuous processes.  These may be implemented as a collection of time and logic function blocks, a custom algorithm, or using a formalized [[Sequential function chart]] methodology.
* [[Intelligent control]] is a class of [[Control theory|control]] techniques that use various [[artificial intelligence]] computing approaches like [[neural networks]], [[Bayesian probability]], [[fuzzy logic]], [[machine learning]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[Genetic algorithm|genetic algorithms]].

== Related Technologies ==

The following technologies are related to APC and in some contexts can be considered part of APC, but are generally separate technologies having their own (or in need of their own) Wiki articles.

* [[Statistical process control]] (SPC), despite its name, is much more common in discrete parts manufacturing and batch process control than in continuous process control.  In SPC, “process” refers to the work and quality control process, rather than continuous process control.
*Batch process control (see ANSI/ISA-88) is employed in non-continuous batch processes, such as many pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and foods.
*Simulation-based optimization incorporates dynamic or steady-state computer-based process simulation models to determine more optimal operating targets in real-time, i.e. on a periodic basis, ranging from hourly to daily.  This is sometimes considered a part of APC, but in practice it is still an emerging technology and is more often part of MPO.
*Manufacturing planning and optimization (MPO) refers to ongoing business activity to arrive at optimal operating targets that are then implemented in the operating organization, either manually or in some cases automatically communicated to the process control system.
*[[Safety instrumented system]] refers to a system that is independent of the process control system, both physically and administratively, whose purpose is to assure basic safety of the process.

== APC Business and Professionals ==

Those responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of APC applications are often referred to as APC Engineers or Control Application Engineers. Usually their education is dependent upon the field of specialization. For example, in the process industries many APC Engineers have a chemical engineering background, combining process control and chemical processing expertise.

Most large operating facilities, such as oil refineries, employ a number of control system specialists and professionals, ranging from field instrumentation, regulatory control system (DCS and PLC), advanced process control, and control system network and security.  Depending on facility size and circumstances, these personnel may have responsibilities across multiple areas, or be dedicated to each area.  There are also many process control service companies that can be hired for support and services in each area.

== Artificial Intelligence and Process Control ==
The use of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques in Process Control is also considered as an advanced process control approach in which intelligence is used to further optimize operational parameters.

Operations and Logics in process control systems in oil and gas and for decades are based only on physics equations that dictates parameters along with operators’ interactions based on experience and operating manuals. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms can look into the dynamic operational conditions, analyse them and suggest optimized parameters that can either directly tune logic parameters or give suggestion to operators. Interventions by such intelligent models leads to optimization in cost, production and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sparkcognition.com/2016/04/sparkblog-oil-and-gas-ai-and-the-promise-of-a-better-tomorrow/|title=Oil and Gas, AI, and the Promise of a Better Tomorrow|date=2016-04-06|work=SparkCognition Inc|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

== Terminology ==

*APC: Advanced process control, including feedforward, decoupling, inferentials, and custom algorithms; usually implies DCS-based.
*ARC: Advanced regulatory control, including adaptive gain, override, logic, fuzzy logic, sequence control, device control, and custom algorithms; usually implies DCS-based. 
*Base-Layer: Includes DCS, SIS, field devices, and other DCS subsystems, such as analyzers, equipment health systems, and PLCs.

'''''Assassin's Creed''''' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] stealth [[video game]] franchise created by [[Patrice Désilets]], [[Jade Raymond]] and [[Corey May]], developed and published by [[Ubisoft]] using the game engine [[Anvil (game engine)|Anvil Next]]. It depicts in the centuries-old struggle, now and then, between the [[Assassins]], who fight for peace with free will, and the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], who desire peace through control. The series features [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]] and [[fictional characters|characters]], intertwined with real-world [[historical events]] and [[historical figures|figures]]. For the majority of time players would control an Assassin in the past history, while they also play as Desmond Miles or an Assassin Initiate in the present day, who hunt down their Templar targets.

The video game series took inspiration from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]'' by the Slovenian writer [[Vladimir Bartol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|title=Interview: Assassin's Creed|publisher=CVG|accessdate=September 2, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025102806/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|archivedate=October 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while building upon concepts from the ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed|title=The Making Of: Assassin's Creed|publisher=EDGE|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228044009/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed/|archivedate=December 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|the self-titled game]] in 2007, and has featured eleven main games. The most recent released game is 2018's ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]''. 

A new story and time period are introduced in each entry, and gameplay elements evolve from the previous one. There are three story arcs in the series. For the first five main games, the framing story is set in 2012 and features series protagonist [[Desmond Miles]] who uses a machine called the Animus and relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the [[2012 phenomenon|2012 apocalypse]]. In games till [[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]], Abstergo employees and Assassin initiates recorded genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The latest two games, [[Assassin's Creed Origins]] and [[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]] follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan as she is recruited into the Assassin's Creed.

Main games of ''Assassin's Creed'' are set in an [[open world]] and presented from the [[third-person perspective]] where the protagonists take down targets using their combat and stealth skills with the exploitation of the environment. Freedom of exploration is given to the player the historical settings to finish main and side quests. Apart from single-player missions, some games also provide competitive and cooperative multiplayer gameplay. While main games are produced for major consoles and desktop platforms, multiple spin-off games were also released in accompany for consoles, mobiles, and handhelds platforms.

The main games in the ''Assassin's Creed'' video game series have received generally positive reviews for their ambition in visuals, game design, and narratives, with criticism towards the yearly release cycle and frequent bugs. The spin-off games received mixed to positive reviews. The video game series has received multiple awards and nominations, including Game of the Year awards. It is also commercially successful, selling over 100 million copies {{as of|2016|9|lc=y}}, becoming Ubisoft's best-selling franchise and one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|highest selling video game franchises of all time]]. ''Assassin's Creed'' was adapted by its [[Assassin's Creed (film)|self-titled film]], which received negative reviews. A book series of art books, encyclopedias, comics, novelizations, and [[Assassin's Creed (book series)|novels]] is also published. All of the media take place within the same continuity as the main video game series.

==History==
[[File:Ubisoft developper team of Assasians creed on Quebec Remparts vs Titan d'Acadie-Bathurst on Centre Vidéotron, Québec city 02.jpg|thumb|Members of Ubisoft Quebec, developer team of the latest title in the series, ''Assassin's Creed Odyssey'']]
The ''Assassin's Creed'' series originated out of ideas for a sequel for ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', a title developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and published by [[Ubisoft]] in 2003. ''The Sands of Time'' was a full 3D adaption  for the [[PlayStation 2]] of the original ''Prince of Persia'' games, and included a number of [[parkour]] moves and combat. ''The Sands of Time'' was a critical and financial success, leading Ubisoft to request Ubisoft Montreal to develop a sequel, aiming for the [[seventh generation of video game consoles|next console generation]]. The Ubisoft Montreal team decided on taking the gameplay from ''The Sands of Time'' into a [[open world]] approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince simply being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the [[Assassins]], heavily borrowing from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]''.&lt;ref name="polygon oral"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/3/17924770/assassins-creed-an-oral-history-patrice-desilets | title=  Assassin’s Creed: An oral history | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 3, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game ''Prince of Persia: Assassin''. Ubisoft was not happy with a ''Prince of Persia'' game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led to the marketing division to suggest the name ''Assassin's Creed'', playing off the creed of the Assassins, "nothing is true; everything is permitted". Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a wholly new [[intellectual property]], eliminating the Prince and creating the conflict between the Assassins and [[Templar Knights]]. Further, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout human history, they came onto the idea of [[genetic memory]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} and created the "Animus" device and modern storyline elements, which further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting when the player fails a mission, in the same way they had done in ''The Sands of Time''.&lt;ref name="polygon oral"/&gt;

Following release of the first ''Assassin's Creed'' in 2007, Ubisoft Montreal and other Ubisoft studios use the series to present games from various historical periods, striving for historical accuracy while conceding some elements for gameplay.&lt;ref name="polygon oral"/&gt;

==Premise==
The ''Assassin's Creed'' games primarily revolve around the rivalry between two ancient secret societies — the [[Assassins]] and the [[Knights Templar]] — and their indirect relation to an [[Ancient astronauts|ancient species pre-dating humanity]], referred to within the games as "those who came before", whose society, along with much of Earth's biosphere, was destroyed by a massive [[Coronal mass ejection|solar storm]] thousands of years before the games. The games' real-world chronological setting begins in the year 2012, but most of the gameplay is in historical settings.

Within the franchise, Abstergo Industries is a [[mega-corporation]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] with multiple branches, secretly run by modern Knights Templar. The company is the present-day main antagonist of the franchise. Abstergo secretly created the "Animus", a device that allows its users to "re-live" and experience the memories of their genetic ancestors within their bloodline through a virtual simulation. Overexposure to the animus causes the "bleeding effect", which results in giving the user skills and abilities of his ancestors, but is also dangerous for the user as it can damage their mind, causing symptoms such as [[dementia]], [[insanity]], [[dissociative identity disorder]] or [[brain damage]]. Abstergo is seeking to discover the location of several historical artifacts, known as the "Pieces of Eden". Such artifacts hold great power, and are capable of controlling [[free will]]. Abstergo seeks to use them to remove free will and bring humanity into one single unified group, while the Assassins oppose them. In order to find the Pieces of Eden, Abstergo is abducting people whose ancestors are suspected to have had historically confirmed or suspected interactions with such devices, forcing the kidnapped person into the Animus and searching for clues on their ancestors' memories within the Animus.

===Protagonists===
{{main|List of Assassin's Creed characters}}
[[Desmond Miles]] is a bartender who is a descendant of several lines of prominent [[Assassins]]; though raised as an Assassin, he left his nomadic family to seek out a more common lifestyle. He is initially kidnapped by Abstergo, which is aware of his ancestral lineage. Desmond is forced into the Animus and is revealed to be subject 17; many of the sixteen previous subjects died as a result of Animus over-exposure.

Desmond is later rescued by a small team of modern-day Assassins and agrees to work with them, continuing to experience the memories of his ancestors to discover the locations of additional Pieces of Eden so they can be recovered before Abstergo can do so. From the bleeding effect, Desmond gains some of the Assassin skills of his predecessors at the cost of living with multiple sets of memories and personalities in his mind.

Within the Animus, Desmond explores the memories of a number of Assassins, including [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]], an initially disgraced Assassin working to redeem himself during the [[Third Crusade]]; [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]], an Assassin in Italy during the late 15th and early 16th centuries of the [[Italian Renaissance]]; and [[Ratonhnhaké:ton]], otherwise known as Connor, a half-[[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], half-[[British people|British]] Assassin during the [[American Revolution]].

Throughout these events, Desmond learns of allusions to the prophetic [[2012 phenomenon|end of the world in 2012]] from a former Animus test subject, Subject 16; the event turns out to be a repeat of the disaster which wiped out the ancient civilization, and he finds out that his memories hold the key to Earth's surviving a second solar storm. During his experiences, Desmond is aided by holographic projections of three of the ancient race's rulers: Jupiter, Minerva, and Juno.

After Desmond dies to ensure Earth's survival, his memories, which have survived through genetic samples of his DNA,&lt;ref name="GI preview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|title=Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|author=Bryan Vore|publisher=Gameinformer.com|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=March 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306035746/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|archivedate=March 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; are accessed by Abstergo, which hires a new subject to enter the Animus. The new subject relives the memories of Edward Kenway (grandfather of Ratohnhaké:ton, otherwise known as Connor Kenway), a privateer-turned-pirate during the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/04/the-dawn-of-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag|title=The Dawn of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|last=George|first=Richard|publisher=IGN|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=August 30, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930175256/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/04/the-dawn-of-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag|archivedate=September 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
While the games are often presented through protagonist Desmond Miles, the bulk of the game is played as Desmond experiences the memories of his ancestors through an advanced device called the Animus. This provides a means of a diegetic interface, showing Desmond's ancestor's health, equipment, goals, and other features as part of the Animus interface. The Animus is based on the player controlling the assassin to maintain the synchronization between Desmond and his ancestor's memories. Performing actions that go against the Assassin's way or dying breaks the synchronization, effectively requiring the player to restart at a previous checkpoint. Furthermore, the player cannot explore outside areas that the assassin has not experienced yet. There are also abnormalities within the Animus from previous users of the device.

While playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]] environment, focusing on [[Stealth game|stealth]] and [[parkour]]. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, generally assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a "leap of faith" into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of Desmond, who by nature of the Animus use has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors. Through the Animus interface, the player can go back to retry any past mission already completed; for example, in ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'', the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner such as by only killing the mission's target.

The games use the concept of "active" versus "passive" moves, with "active" moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards' alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade set in a bracer on the Assassin's arm, and which also can be used to quietly assassinate targets.

===Main series===

====''Assassin's Creed''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed (video game)}}
Desmond Miles is captured by Abstergo and forced to use a machine called the Animus to explore Altaïr ibn-La'Ahad's memories during the time of the [[Third Crusade]]. Desmond begins to witness events after Altaïr breaks all three tenets of the Assassin Brotherhood while attempting to stop [[Robert IV de Sablé|Robert de Sablé]] from taking a Piece of Eden. [[Al Mualim]], the Brotherhood's leader, demotes Altaïr to Novice and tasks him with assassinating the nine Knights Templars, including de Sablé, to regain his former status. Altaïr's quest eventually leads him to face de Sablé in the presence of King [[Richard I of England]] warning the King of de Sablé's plot to kill him. Altaïr defeats de Sablé, but with his last words, de Sablé reveals that there were ten Templars, the last being Al Mualim, who now holds the Piece of Eden. Altaïr returns to face Al Mualim and struggles to fight through illusions created by the Piece, but eventually kills Al Mualim. When Altaïr recovers the piece, he and those watching the Animus view a holographic map showing where other artifacts are located across the globe. Desmond is pulled from the Animus, and was going to be killed, but his life is spared by [[Lucy Stillman]], an Assassin working as a mole within Abstergo, as she claims they might need to further examine his memories later. He comes to learn that a former test subject had left messages only Desmond can see, foretelling the end of the world in 2012.

The first ''Assassin's Creed'' introduced core elements that remained  in the rest of the game series. The game creates fictionalized, historical versions of [[Masyaf]] (the Brotherhood's location), [[Jerusalem]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Damascus]], and incorporates a number of documented historical figures into the story. Other core elements include the virtualized Animus system, free running, climbing, stealth, [[parkour]], and the initial formulation of the combat system. The game requires the player to complete a number of side quests before they are able to obtain an assassin quest from a local Brotherhood guidemaster in each city, but this side quest prerequisite was abandoned in future games.

====''Assassin's Creed II''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed II}}
Lucy returns and breaks Desmond out of Abstergo, taking him to an Assassin safehouse to work alongside Shaun, a historian, and Rebecca, their technical support. Using an improved version of the Animus, Desmond takes witness to Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman from the late 15th century in [[Florence]], shortly before the execution of Ezio's father and brothers by order of a corrupt official working for the Templars. He, his mother, and sister take to hiding at the Monteriggioni villa owned by his uncle Mario, who helps to train Ezio in the ways of an Assassin. Ezio and Mario discover that Rodrigo Borgia is the figurehead of a number of Templars all who were accomplices in the execution of his family, and with help of allies like [[Leonardo da Vinci]], methodically assassinate the lower-ranked Templars, while learning that Borgia has acquired a Piece of Eden called the Apple. Eventually, Ezio corners Borgia, who hands over the Piece and flees; Ezio is inducted into the ranks of the Brotherhood and believed to be a prophet based on their codex. A decade later, the Brotherhood learns that Borgia has since become [[Pope Alexander VI]], using the Church's influence to strengthen the Templars. Ezio invades [[Vatican City]] and confronts Borgia, discovering that the Papal staff is also a Piece of Eden. Defeating Borgia but sparing his life, Ezio uses both the Apple and the Papal staff to reveal a chamber of ancient technology. Inside, he is addressed by a hologram of a humanoid female that calls herself Minerva who speaks directly to Desmond through Ezio. Minerva explains how her society had pre-dated humanity's, but a great disaster nearly wiped them out, and warns that another event is due to occur soon, putting the fate of humanity in Desmond's hands. Upon this discovery, Desmond and his allies find the safehouse has been compromised by Abstergo and flee.

Similar to the first game, ''Assassin's Creed II'' takes place in historical recreations of [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Forlì]], [[San Gimignano]], and the [[Tuscany|Tuscan countryside]], and incorporates events during that period as part of the story. Missions are divided into main story missions, themselves divided into memory sequences reflecting points in Ezio's life, and side missions which can be accomplished at any time; this approach to mission structure remains consistent in the other games in the series. The Monteriggioni villa provides several functions which can be expanded on by paying money for upgrades of surrounding buildings, or by purchasing artwork, weapons, and armor for the villa; in turn, the villa will generate wealth for the player at a rate influenced by the upgrades and acquisition of these items. Additional quests involve locating secret Assassin seals, and finding hidden marks left by "Subject 16", a former Animus user, that hint at the nature of Minerva's society.

====''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood}}
Desmond and his allies retreat to the ruins of the Monteriggioni villa, and Desmond reenters the Animus to continue Ezio's memories, specifically to identify the location of the Apple. After facing Rodrigo Borgia, Ezio returned to Monteriggioni, but the villa is soon attacked by forces under the command of [[Cesare Borgia]], Rodrigo's son. Mario is killed and the Apple is stolen. Ezio vows revenge by helping to free the people of Rome from the Borgia family. As Ezio works covertly to turn the city against the Borgias, he gains followers that want to join his cause, and Ezio trains them in the way of the Assassins. In an attempt to assassinate Cesare and Rodrigo at the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], Ezio instead witnesses Cesare forcing his father to eat a poisoned apple that Rodrigo had prepared to kill his son. Ezio chases down Cesare and eventually captures him and recovers the Apple. Cesare is taken to prison in Viana, Spain but manages to escape with help of his allies. The Assassins lead the fight against Cesare and the remaining loyal Borgia troops, and eventually Ezio throws Cesare from the castle walls, killing him. With no perceived further threats, Ezio takes to hide the Apple under the [[Colosseum]]. In the present, Desmond is able to navigate through the underground chambers beneath the Colosseum to locate the Apple. As he picks it up, Desmond is witness to another hologram figure, calling herself Juno, and who controls Desmond to stab Lucy (because Lucy has defected to the Templars) before he falls into a coma.

''Brotherhood'' shares many of the same features as the previous game though it takes place primarily in Rome. Similar to the villa, the player is able to spend money to buy and upgrade shops and other facilities throughout the city as to increase revenue they can collect from it; however, the player will be required to destroy Borgia towers that control various sections of the city before they can do so.  The Brotherhood of Assassins is introduced, by which, after saving citizens from certain events, the player can invite these citizens as Assassins; they can then be dispatched to remote locations across Europe to gain experience and money, or can be called in to help the player directly in a mission. For the first time in the series, the game features online multiplayer. Players play as Abstergo employees, who, through the use of the Animus, take on the genetic memories of Renaissance Templars in various game modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |title=GameStop Placeholder Art Names Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood – Update |newspaper=[[Kotaku]] |date=May 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |last=Fahey |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Fahey |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829145121/http://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |archivedate=August 29, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last game to feature ''Assassin's Creed'' creator [[Patrice Désilets]], as the creative director of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |title=Assassin's Creed Creator Talks Life After Ubisoft, Again |last=Bertz |first=Matt |date=July 20, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822214710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |archivedate=August 22, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |title=Update: Patrice Désilets Walks Away From Ubisoft And Assassin's Creed |last=McNamara |first=Andy |author-link=Andy McNamara |date=June 11, 2010 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201180243/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |archivedate=December 1, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Revelations}}

Within the computerized "core" of the Animus, Subject 16 ([[Clay Kaczmarek]]) explains to a comatose Desmond that his mind must achieve full synchronization with Altaïr and Ezio, or he will fall into [[dementia]]. Desmond sees Ezio's memories, years after ''Brotherhood'', Ezio researches the Assassins' history and travels to Masyaf to locate Altaïr's library, rumored to hold great power within. The Templars also seek to open this library, but it is locked by five keys, hidden in the Ottoman-held [[Constantinople]]. Ezio finds the city in a feud  between brothers [[Selim I|Selim]] and [[Şehzade Ahmet|Ahmet]] vying for the Sultanate. Ezio is aided by [[List of Assassin's Creed characters#Sofia Sartor|Sofia Sartor]]; the two fall in love. Eventually, Ahmet reveals himself to be a Templar, and is killed by Selim after he battles with Ezio. Ezio uses the keys to witness Altaïr's memories before and after [[Al Mualim]]'s death, which show the death of Altaïr's wife and youngest son in the midst of a [[coup d'etat]] within the Assassins. Altair exiles himself for twenty years, eventually returning to Masyaf to kill the usurper and retake control. Altaïr inscribes his memories in the keys and asks his friend [[Niccolò Polo]] to hide them. Afterwards, Ezio and Sofia go to Masyaf and open the library to find Altaïr's corpse and a Piece of Eden. Ezio leaves it and his assassin tools, and tells Desmond, understanding now of his role as a messenger to him. A holographic being calling himself Jupiter explains to Desmond (through Ezio) how his society perished as a result of a massive [[solar flare]] apocalypse, and that the key to stop the 2012 solar flare lies in the first civilization's technology commanded by vaults linked to a central vault in New York. Within the Animus, Clay sacrifices himself to allow Desmond to wake up from his coma, his memories complete. Along with Shaun, Rebecca, and his father William, Desmond heads to New York to save humanity.

Originally ''Revelations'' was announced as ''Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy'', and conceptualized as a [[Nintendo 3DS]] title focusing on Ezio traveling to Masyaf. However, on July 15, 2011, it was announced as cancelled. The reason behind such "cancellation" was that Ubisoft had decided to expand the idea further, cancel the 3DS development and fully shift all development duties towards PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC to release the game as a full-fledged main installment of the franchise. The original plot remained, and evolved into the plot seen in the final game, which became ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Tom|title=Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy canned|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|publisher=Eurogamer|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718043046/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|archivedate=July 18, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included were many new systems and additional weapons such as bomb-crafting, allowing the player to create explosive, distraction and tactical bombs, using materials found throughout the world and on Assassin's Guild missions. The hookblade was also introduced, which can be used in free-running (to travel along zip wires and climb more easily) and in combat (to manipulate enemies). Eagle Vision was upgraded into the Eagle Sense, allowing Ezio to not only see where his enemies and targets are but also, where they have been and where they are moving to. As the player progresses through, Ezio can train new recruits to defend "dens" (Assassin HQs) and an upgraded Assassin's missions section called "Mediterranean Defense" in which the player works to strip control of various cities from Templar hands. The multiplayer mode returned in ''Revelations'', with more characters, modes, and maps, and by advancing up through levels of experience, the player learns more about Abstergo's history.

====''Assassin's Creed III''====
{{Main|Assassin's Creed III}}
{{Long plot|section|date=January 2017}}

Desmond and his allies arrive at the Temple entrance in a cave in the New York area on October 31, 2012, and open its door using the Apple of Eden, discovering a larger chamber of Precursor technology behind it, including another door requiring a key. Desmond suddenly falls into a [[fugue state]], and is put into the Animus.

In the Animus, he experiences the memories of Haytham Kenway, who is later revealed as a Templar [[British people|British]] agent, who had gone to the American Colonies with a stolen medallion, and, with Templar allies including [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], gained the [[Mohawk people]]'s trust as the means to find a Temple's location, but to his annoyance, the medallion did not open the Temple for him. The remainder of the game shifts protagonist, to the memories of Haytham's son [[Ratonhnhaké:ton]], whose heritage is half [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]. As a young boy, he witnesses Lee and his troops set fire to his village, killing his mother; years later, he is shown a Piece of Eden, through which Juno speaks to him and instructs him to get training from the retired Assassin, Achilles Davenport, who later inducts him into the order and nicknames him Connor (in memory of his dead son, deceased in the [[American Revolution]]). Through him, Connor meets Patriots in the Revolution, helping them to stop several Templar plans, including an assassination attempt against [[George Washington]]. Between memories, Desmond helps his allies to recover power sources to power the Temple scattered about the globe, including one held by Abstergo.

Connor eventually faces his father, who offers a ceasefire, as he is also after Benjamin Church for usurping his authority. They team up to investigate, Kenway warns Connor about the Patriots, seeking to remove Connor's people from their lands due to fear of an allegiance against the British. Connor eventually hunts and kills Lee, takes the medallion and ends the Templar threat. He is despondent to find his tribe's village abandoned save for the Piece of Eden; through it, Juno tells him to hide the amulet. Desmond wakes up on December 21, and with his allies finds the buried medallion, key to the inner Temple door, behind is a control sphere capable of stopping the solar flare. Juno appears and encourages Desmond to touch it, but Minerva appears and warns him not to, as it would release Juno as an entity that would protect against the solar flare, but would also be a threat to mankind's future. Juno says Minerva would rather have most of humanity wiped out, and Desmond survive to be a religious figure to lead the survivors, ultimately leading into conflict. Desmond opts to release Juno, believing humanity will have a better chance fighting Juno. The energy from the control sphere, protects Earth from the solar flare, but kills Desmond. Juno tells Desmond's corpse that his work is now done, and now it is time for her to work.

''Assassin's Creed III'' is structured similarly to the previous games, with missions taking place on an open-world map based on Colonial Boston and New York, and offers a large wilderness area, the Frontier and in the Davenport Homestead, where the player can hunt animals for materials, which then subsequently can be used to construct goods to be traded and sold throughout the colonies. Naval battles were introduced, wherein the player must steer a warship named ''Aquila'' in dangerous waters and perform ship-to-ship combat with cannons and mounted guns. In Assassin's Creed III there are a large assortment of side missions to play and many different outfits to purchase as the player progresses through the game. The modern-day aspects of the story were also significantly expanded, and featured missions taking place in, among other locations, Manhattan, Rome and Brazil.

====''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''====
{{Main|Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag}}
Samples taken from Desmond Miles' body in the moments after his death have enabled Abstergo Industries to continue to explore his genetic memories using the Animus' newfound cloud computing abilities. The unnamed player character is hired by Abstergo's entertainment division to sift through the memories of Edward Kenway, an eighteenth-century pirate and the grandfather of Connor. Ostensibly, this is to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive video game, but in reality, Abstergo and the Templars are searching for the Observatory, a Precursor structure that allows the user to see through the eyes of a subject. As Kenway, the player must unravel a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars to manipulate the British, Spanish and French empires into locating the Sage – later identified as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] – who is the only man who can lead them to the Observatory.

In the present day, the player is contacted by John, Abstergo Entertainment's information technology manager. John convinces the player that his employer knows more than they are telling, and encourages them to investigate in more detail. He arranges for the player to access the Animus' core, at which point Juno materialises into an incorporeal form. She reveals that although it was necessary to open her temple to avert disaster, the world was not ready for her, and she is unable to affect it or possess the player character as her agents intended. John is unmasked as the reincarnated form of the Sage and attempts to murder the player to cover up the failed attempt at resurrecting Juno, but is killed by Abstergo's security before he can do so. As Roberts, the Sage admits to Kenway that he owes no allegiance to the Assassins or the Templars and instead uses whoever he thinks represents his best chance of achieving his ends.

====''Assassin's Creed Rogue''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed Rogue}}
The plot follows Assassin-turned-Templar, [[Shay Patrick Cormac]], and is set during the [[Seven Years' War]] across various locations in northeastern North America and the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name="PolygonRogue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue confirmed by Ubisoft - here's the first trailer|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|work=Polygon|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806140407/http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|archivedate=August 6, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is meant to "fill the gaps" of the story between ''III'' and ''Black Flag'' and has "a crucial link to the Kenway saga", as well as connecting to ''Unity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|title=September Cover Revealed – Assassin's Creed Rogue And Unity|last=Wallace|first=Kimberly|publisher=GameStop|work=Game Informer|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805190710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|archivedate=August 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haytham Kenway from ''III'' and [[Adéwalé]] from ''Black Flag'' make appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|title=Sources: Assassin's Creed Comet Will Let You Play As A Templar|last=Schreier|first=Jason|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 27, 2014|accessdate=March 27, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328120043/http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|archivedate=March 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 2014, a game titled or code-named "''Comet''," was revealed to be in development, for release on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].&lt;ref name="KotakuUnity" /&gt; By the end of the month, additional reports indicated that ''Comet'' would be set around 1758 in New York, as well as feature sailing on the Atlantic Ocean. The game would be a direct sequel to ''Black Flag'', and would be the first to feature a Templar as the main protagonist, named Shay.  In May 2014, Guillemot stated that ''Assassin's Creed'' games would continue releasing on the last generation PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 "for the foreseeable future", despite the franchise moving to the current generation PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with ''Assassin's Creed Unity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/assassins-creed-games-coming-to-ps3-xbox-360-for-foreseeable-future|title=Assassin's Creed Games Coming To PS3, Xbox 360 For 'Foreseeable Future'|last=Watts|first=Steve|publisher=IGN|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=May 16, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516215024/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/assassins-creed-games-coming-to-ps3-xbox-360-for-foreseeable-future|archivedate=May 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, Ubisoft officially announced the game as ''Assassin's Creed Rogue''.

===Cancelled and defunct games===

====''Assassin's Creed: Project Legacy''====
''Assassin's Creed: Project Legacy'' was a single-player [[Browser game|browser-based]] [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] Facebook application, designed as a promotion, and tie-in for ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''. The game is mostly [[Online text-based role-playing game|text-based]], but includes graphics and sound as well as some video.

Players are test subjects for Abstergo Industries who relive the lives of other test subjects' Assassin ancestors; instead of using the Animus, players use the Data Dump Scanner (DDS).

The first mission pack is titled "Italian Wars", and is divided into four chapters. Chapter one focuses on [[Bartolomeo d'Alviano]] during the [[Battle of Agnadello]]. The second chapter focuses on [[Francesco Vecellio]] on a mission to kill [[Niccolò di Pitigliano]] (cousin of Bartolomeo d'Alviano). The third focuses on Mario Auditore and the protection of [[Monteriggioni]]. The fourth and final chapter focuses on [[Lucrezia Borgia#Affair with Perotto|Perotto Calderon]], an undercover assassin who watches over [[Lucrezia Borgia]], with whom he falls in love.

The second mission pack, entitled "Rome", was released November 16, 2010. The first chapter takes place between 1497 and 1503, and deals with the ex-courtesan, Fiora Cavazza. It deals with Fiora's involvement in recruiting an army for the Borgia, and her subsequent betrayal. The second takes place in 1503, and involves [[Giovanni Borgia (Infans Romanus)|Giovanni Borgia]], fleeing his family and eventually joining the assassins. Chapter three involves Francesco Vecellio, and his training to be an assassin under Ezio Auditore. Chapter four again focuses on Giovanni Borgia, now an Assassin and joining [[Hernán Cortés]] on his journey to [[Tenochtitlan]] to acquire a "Piece of Eden", one of the [[Crystal Skull]]s. Giovanni brought it to [[Paracelsus|Bombastus]] for study, resulting in the discovery of the formula for the [[Philosopher's stone]].

The third mission pack, entitled "Holidays", and its first Chapter called Ghosts of Christmas Past were released on December 21, 2010 with further missions to be released in 2011.{{update after|2011|12|31}} The first chapter takes place at various times and places in history: during the [[World War I]] [[Christmas Truce]], the ''[[Beagle 2]]'' truth, the return of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] back to [[Kingdom of England|England]], and the time of the [[Shroud of Turin]].

A fourth story pack, "The Divine Science Story Pack" was announced, but never released. Additionally, an updated user interface (referred to as the 'DDS 2.0') was announced, but not released.  The DDS 2.0 would have offered an easier method of selecting mission packs and equipment.

The game was later shut down and put on an indefinite hold.

''Utopia'' would have taken place in the 17th century, at the very beginning of the [[colonization of North America]].

In November 2011, a Ubisoft survey was sent out, asking participants which locations and time periods they would like to see in the "next ''Assassin's Creed'' games". These settings were [[Medieval China]], [[Victorian England]], [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese]] and/or [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Invasion]] of the [[Americas]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[Russian Revolution]], [[Feudal Japan]], and [[Ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/327625/assassins-creed-3-possible-locations-named-in-survey|title=AC:3 Possible Locations Named In Survey|publisher=CVG|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=November 30, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130223352/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/327625/assassins-creed-3-possible-locations-named-in-survey/|archivedate=November 30, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Hutchinson, creative director of ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', suggested the most requested ''Assassin's Creed'' settings, [[World War II]], Feudal Japan and Ancient Egypt, are "the three worst settings for an ''Assassin's Creed'' game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dutton |first=Fred |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-04-ubisoft-ww2-japan-and-egypt-would-make-dismal-assassins-creed-locations |title=Ubisoft: WW2, Japan and Egypt would make dismal Assassin's Creed locations |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=April 4, 2012 |accessdate=August 15, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709235650/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-04-ubisoft-ww2-japan-and-egypt-would-make-dismal-assassins-creed-locations |archivedate=July 9, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hutchinson stated both he and [[Corey May]] were open to the idea of a future entry set during the time of the [[British Raj]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|title=India-set Assassin's Creed on Ubisoft's radar|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/india-set-assassins-creed-on-ubisofts-radar-6370104|publisher=GameSpot|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020105717/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/india-set-assassins-creed-on-ubisofts-radar-6370104|archivedate=October 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which now consists of the modern states of [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Myanmar]].

In June 2013, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated on the development cycle of the games, saying, "We are making sure the teams who are creating the different iterations have enough time—two years, three years, so that they can take risk and they can change the concept enough so that it can be appealing and fresh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/ubisoft-has-three-assassins-creeds-in-development-vow-513376223|title=Ubisoft Has Three Assassin's Creeds in Development, Vows Innovation|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|date=June 14, 2013|accessdate=June 14, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617052003/http://kotaku.com/ubisoft-has-three-assassins-creeds-in-development-vow-513376223|archivedate=June 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following August, ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''{{'}}s director Ashraf Ismail said that the ending of the franchise had been written, saying "We have an idea of where the end is, what the end is.

=====''Assassin's Creed: Embers''=====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Embers}}
The short film follows an elderly Ezio, living a peaceful life in the Tuscan countryside with his wife Sofia and his children Flavia and Marcello and writing his memoirs. One day a stranger appears, a Chinese female Assassin called [[Shao Jun]], who came to Ezio in order to seek knowledge of his life as an Assassin. Although Ezio prefers that Jun not stay, due to his desire to leave his days as an Assassin behind, Sofia allows her to stay for the night. The next day, Ezio catches Jun reading his memoirs and bids her to leave, but relents after she asks him about what it means to be an Assassin. While on a trip to [[Firenze]], Ezio then recounts his story of [[Assassin's Creed II#Plot|how his father and brothers were executed in the town square, forcing him to become an Assassin]], and how such a life is defined by the pain it brings and causes. As they leave, the two are attacked by a stranger, who appears to be of Asian origin as well. After killing him, Jun reveals that she was a former [[concubine]], now on the run from servants of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]], and explains how her former master rescued her from his influence. After returning to his home, Ezio tells Sofia and his children to leave, knowing that others would come. He then teaches Jun the key to liberating her people from the Emperor's influence. Later that night, Ezio's villa is attacked by more of Shao Jun's enemies, and after a fight, he successfully eliminates them all. The next morning, Ezio hands Shao Jun a small box and tells her it may come to use one day, but only if "you lose your way". He then sends her away as two riders appear at the villa. Sometime afterward Ezio journeys to Firenze with his wife Sofia and their daughter Flavia, despite suffering from heart problems. While resting on a bench and after having a short conversation with a young man with a scar on his face, similar to the sort of man he used to be, he exhales and dies in view of his family. The film then ends as a final letter from Ezio to Sofia is read, saying that of all the things that kept him going throughout life, love for the world around him was the strongest of them all.

====''Assassin's Creed: Graphic Novel''====
In the limited edition of ''Assassin's Creed'', an 8-page [[graphic novel]] was included, that showed two side-stories of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad and Desmond Miles. The story serves as a prelude to the first ''Assassin's Creed'' game and is narrated simultaneously by both characters. In it, the novel covers Desmond's escape from Abstergo in the year 2012 and also one of Altaïr's assassination missions in the year 1191. The start of the novel involves the introduction of the two characters with Altaïr calling himself a hunter, while Desmond is a prisoner. Although initially they describe themselves otherwise, by the end of the novel they both re-introduce themselves as assassins.

====''Assassin's Creed, Volume 1: Desmond''====
''Assassin's Creed Volume 1: Desmond'' is a French-language graphic novel written by Eric Corbeyran and drawn by Djilalli Defaux. It has been released in France, Canada, Belgium, Poland and Italy.

It is said that Subject 16 is alive but trapped in the animus, a virtual reality simulator used to relive memories of ancient relatives, but there's no mention of Shaun or Rebecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ju7K9De8ck |title=Assassin's Creed : Desmond – Trailer de la bande dessinée |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222012930/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ju7K9De8ck |archivedate=February 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Desmond relives memories of Aquilus through the animus after his apparent death in the first volume. The Roman assassin is rescued by his cousin, Accipiter, and is tasked with a quest to save [[Lugdunum]]. He meets with his father and discovers an artifact of the first civilization: an [[ankh]] which can temporarily revive the dead. The mysterious object is then stolen by a Templar senator, Vultur, who kills Aquilus' father.

The modern day story continues as Assassins fight Abstergo agents when they're ambushed on the road. Later, it is revealed that there's a traitor among in the Assassins' truck, and Desmond deals with the situation. The group finally arrives in Monteriggioni and at the end, it's hinted that the ankh artifact might be hidden within the town's walls.

====''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''====
''Assassin's Creed: Revelations'' is the fourth novel in the continuation of the ''Assassin's Creed'' series written by Oliver Bowden and published by Penguin Books. The novel release date is November 24, 2011 for the United Kingdom and November 29, 2011 for the North America. Like the previous novels of ''Renaissance'' and ''Brotherhood'', it is a novelised version of the game ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''. Additionally like the prior novels, it does not contain any of the game's present-day events including Desmond. Like the game, Ezio Auditore must leave his life behind in search of answers, in search of the truth. In Assassin's Creed: Revelations, master assassin Ezio Auditore walks in the footsteps of the legendary mentor Altair, on a journey of discovery and revelation. It is a perilous path—one that will take Ezio to Constantinople, the heart of the Ottoman Empire, where a growing army of Templars threatens to destabilise the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141966724,00.html?strSrchSql=assassins+creed/Assassin's_Creed:_Revelations_Oliver_Bowden |title=Assassin's Creed: Revelations - Oliver Bowden - Penguin Books |publisher=Penguin.co.uk |date=November 24, 2011 |accessdate=August 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521210447/http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141966724,00.html?strSrchSql=assassins+creed%2FAssassin%27s_Creed%3A_Revelations_Oliver_Bowden |archivedate=May 21, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Assassin's Creed: Encyclopedia''===
[[UbiWorkshop]] released an encyclopedia of the ''Assassin's Creed'' series in 2011. Initially intended as an art book, the project gathered so much material that the company decided to expand it into an encyclopedia. It features works of artists, such as Craig Mullins, Tavis Coburn, 123Klan, Gabz and James NG. Artists were given creative freedom, as they were able to create a unique Assassin from the period of their choosing. The art book contains a "carte blanche" section, which is going to contain fan-submitted artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubiworkshop.com/artbook.html|title=Artists for hire|publisher=Ubiworkshop.com|accessdate=October 21, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822160318/http://www.ubiworkshop.com/artbook.html|archivedate=August 22, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/your-face-stabbing-art-could-be-featured-in-assassins-creed-art-book/|title=Your face-stabbing art could be featured in Assassin's Creed art book|publisher=GamesRadar|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117034023/http://www.gamesradar.com/your-face-stabbing-art-could-be-featured-in-assassins-creed-art-book/|archivedate=January 17, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, to coincide with the release of ''Assassin's Creed III'', UbiWorkshop released a second edition of the encyclopedia. This Edition contained an additional 120 pages of content, covering both ''Assassin's Creed III'' and ''Assassin's Creed: The Chain'', as well as revised content based on feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.ubiworkshop.com/assassins-creed-encyclopedia-second-edition/|title=Assassin's Creed - Encyclopedia: Second Edition - UbiWorkshop|work=UbiWorkshop Store|accessdate=October 6, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127014807/http://store.ubiworkshop.com/assassins-creed-encyclopedia-second-edition|archivedate=November 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'' introduces the character of Olivier Garneau, as the CEO of video game company Abstergo Entertainment (who helps Ubisoft to develop the ''Assassin's Creed'' video games within the franchise's fictional plot). During the game's plot, Garneau goes to [[Chicago]], the setting of Ubisoft's game ''[[Watch Dogs]]''. In the latter video game, Garneau is the subject of a side mission that sees playable protagonist Aiden Pearce saving him from being kidnapped, it is implied that by the Assassin's Brotherhood. Additionally, two characters in the game are seen playing ''Assassin's Creed II''.

Mario Raimondo, known as '''Barbadirame''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] artist.

==Life==
Barbadirame was a close associate of [[Pablo Picasso]] from when the pair first met in the 1950s until Picasso’s death in 1973. Speaking about Barbadirame in 1963 Pablo Picasso said: “To speak about young painters it is not my habit. The Italian painter ‘Raimondo' known as ‘Barbadirame', is a true painter, serious, like the workers of his earth. He implements his works decisively and with simplicity. The stone walls, the mediterranean olive trees, all have the same humanity of their agriculturists, the eternity. He is an artist that counts”.

Mario Raimondo was born in [[Dolceacqua]], Italy, in 1923. He began his professional life as a decorator, painting numerous frescoes in private residences and castles while wandering the [[Riviera dei Fiori]] and the [[Costa Azzurra]]. Barbadirame was a complete artist, equally at home in different mediums. A painter and a sculptor, one of his most famed sculptures is the huge statue he created, in collaboration with Mario Agrifoglio, in honor of  the astronomer [[Gian Domenico Cassini]] (1625–1712).

During his life Barbadirame’s exhibitions were attended by celebrities  including [[Jean Cocteau]], Picasso, [[Grace Kelly]] and her husband, the prince of Monaco. Towards the end of his career, Barbardirame received  the Biamonti Prize, a prize for art and literature portraying the true essence of Italy’s Liguria region. The prize was named after [[Francesco Biamonti]] (1933–2001), a celebrated Italian novelist from Liguria.  Biamonti himself wrote of Barbardirame’s work: “His peasants, his women, his Christs have lost every crudeness, without losing the truth of their solidity…” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanremobuonenotizie.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1256:dolceacqua-in-lutto-per-la-scomparsa-del-maestro-barbadirame&amp;catid=96:imperiese&amp;Itemid=320&amp;lang=it |title=All'artista Barbadirame la gratitudine di Dolceacqua|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Basic writing''', or '''developmental writing''', is a discipline of [[composition studies]] which focuses on the writing of students sometimes otherwise called "remedial" or "underprepared", usually [[freshman]] college students.

==Defining basic writing==
Sometimes called “remedial” or “developmental” writing, basic writing (BW) was developed in the 1970s, generally under the constraints of [[open admissions]] policies. Basic writing courses are meant to help students come to a basic understanding and familiarity with formal written English. BW students can be categorized two ways: 1) students coming straight from high school, who did not develop a basic competency in formal written English before graduation and who placed below average on a college writing placement test, and 2) [[non-traditional student]]s who are older than average college freshman and who are coming to college for the first time in order to further their education in the hopes of gaining the skills necessary for better employment and earning more money. These are generally students that may have full-time jobs, come to classes at night, and may have children, and perhaps be a single parent. In some cases non-native and [[English language learning and teaching|ESL]] students are also considered basic writers, because of their unfamiliarity with the English language, let alone formal written English (sometimes identified as [[standard English]]).

BW students are usually characterized by a lack of understanding of the rules of formal written English which may manifest itself in non-traditional syntax, grammar, spelling, punctuation, usage, mechanics, organization, and clarity. [[Mina Shaughnessy]], a pioneer in the field of basic writing, characterized basic writers as “those that had been left so far behind the others in their formal education that they appeared to have little chance of catching up, students whose difficulty with the written language seemed of a different order from those of the other groups, as if they had come, you might say, from a different country, or at least through different schools, where even modest standards of high-school literacy had not been met."&lt;ref&gt;Shaughnessy, Mina. ''Errors and Expectations''. New York: Oxford UP, 1977, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; However, BW is also a relative term. What might be considered freshman-level writing at one university might be characterized as basic writing at another, or even advanced writing at another, depending on the ability of the general student population and university standards.

Basic Writing is also a field of study. The research in the field probes into the concerns of teachers and students on the academic margins. Deborah Mutnick explains about Basic Writing:

“It signifies struggles for inclusion, diversity and equal opportunity; debates over standards and linguistic hegemony; the exploitation of faculty and staff on the academic margins; and the policies that opened and not threatened to close higher education’s doors to masses of people. It has played a key role not only in providing opportunities for research on adult literacy but also in illuminating the politics of writing in terms of race, class, ethnicity, and other social structures that would have remained invisible in the mostly white, middle-class classrooms that have traditionally constituted the “mainstream.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to Composition Pedagogies|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Deborah Mutnick|authorlink=On the Academic Margins: Basic Writing Pedagogy|editor1=Gary Tate |editor2=Amy Rupiper |editor3=Kurt Schick |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of basic writing==
The creation of basic writing courses in colleges across the United States is largely the result of the creation of open-admissions policies that no longer required academic standards be set for entrance into college. The first to start such a program was the City University of New York ([[City University of New York|CUNY]]). Before opening their campus to all those who wanted higher education, regardless of previous academic performance, CUNY had instituted the SEEK program (Search for [[Education]], [[Elevation]], and [[Knowledge]]) which was designed as a pre-collegiate program that was meant to prepare students, who were not yet ready to enter the university, for full admission. However, with the advent of open admissions in 1970 there was no longer a need for pre-collegiate classes, so the program transformed into a course taken by those admitted to the university who did not place well on admissions placement tests. The writing program that stemmed from this transformation became known as a basic writing course because it dealt not with preparing highly literate students for upper-level course work, but with the teaching the very basics of written communication.

Since the late seventies, many colleges and universities have created open admissions policies, and have in turn created BW programs across the country. However, from the very beginning there has been large opposition to open admissions policies. Open admissions detractors have prevailed at some colleges and universities, overturning open admissions policies. As a result, BW course have either been eliminated entirely from the curriculum or have been relegated to community colleges.

==Major theorists==

===Mina P. Shaughnessy===
[[Mina P. Shaughnessy]] (pronounced MY-NA SHAWN-ES-EE), involved with the SEEK program at CUNY, was a proponent of open admissions for City College (part of the CUNY system) and became director of the BW program once City College opened its doors to all. Shaughnessy worked hard not only to design a curriculum for students that seemed alien to the professors that literally did not know what to do with students who seemed not to be able to put two words together, in some cases, but to understand and categorize the characteristics of basic writers in order to understand them better, and be able to teach them more effectively. For this purpose, Shaughnessy compiled four-thousand placement essays written by students as part of the entrance process into City College and classified the errors that she found, trying to understand the logic behind spelling, syntax, grammar, etc., that seemed, at best, scattered and, at worst, completely arbitrary. She published her results in the book [[Errors and Expectations]] (1977). Her main conclusion is that these writers are not scattered or arbitrary, but that they have created systems of [[Standard written English|written English]] based on misunderstood rules, half-understood lessons on punctuation, their own local or familial dialects, among others, and have logically created their own systems of written English. It is not that these students do not understand communication, but they simply have not been taught or have misunderstood the rules of written formal English. Shaughnessy’s work was considered groundbreaking and Errors and Expectations is still considered the seminal book in the field of BW. And although she died in 1978, and other scholars have made contributions to the field, Shaughnessy remains its leading figure today.

[[Mina P. Shaughnessy]] is arguably the most prominent name in the field of BW. She helped create the atmosphere of academic respectability BW needed to become recognized as a legitimate scholarly field. Her 1977 book, [[Errors and Expectations]], set the tone for much (if not all) of the BW scholarship that followed. BW scholars, whether they agree with Shaughnessy or not, are still responding to her.

The ‘‘‘Bedford Bibliography for Teachers of Basic Writing’’’ includes this annotation for [[Errors and Expectations]]:

:“Shaughnessy takes teachers through writing problems such as poor handwriting and punctuation, syntax, common errors, spelling and vocabulary errors, and lack of idea development. While her focus is primarily on error, it is underscored by a sensitive understanding of the reasons behind the rhetorical and linguistic difficulties discussed and a strong belief in the inherent intelligence of learners described as ‘basic writers.’ Shaughnessy's claims about the difficulties faced by basic writers are supported by examples from thousands of student papers. Examples of many kinds of errors are provided. Each chapter also includes suggestions for the teacher on how to reduce the particular kind of error discussed in that specific chapter. Shaughnessy also explains why these errors occur by examining the rules that are manifested in students' writing. The book also contains an appendix that includes suggestions for placement essay topics and also contains suggested readings for the teacher of basic writing.” [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_res.html#113]

All in all, Shaughnessy saw disadvantaged students as being intelligent (though scholastically under-prepared). She resolutely held that such students could be taught how to effectively write. It is teachers of BW and not BW students that need to radically alter their views toward the teaching and learning of writing. In her 1976 speech, "Diving In: An Introduction to Basic Writing", she asserted that “teachers (need to) realize and accept the need to remediate themselves regarding the needs and learning styles of basic writers.” [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_bwwwt.html#69]

====Shaughnessy controversy====

From the ‘‘‘Bedford Bibliography for Teachers of Basic Writing’’’:
:“Min-Zhan Lu's 1992 article ‘Conflict and Struggle: The Enemies or Preconditions of Basic Writing?’ [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/cd_tdp.html#216] inspired a flurry of feminist, Marxist, and poststructuralist reexaminations of Mina Shaughnessy's work. These critiqued Shaughnessy on three counts: for forwarding an ‘essentialist’ conception of language that separates thought from expression and views discourse as a transparent vessel for meaning; for promoting basic writers' accommodation to mainstream linguistic standards and thereby minimizing the political dimensions of language use; and for overlooking materialist considerations such as the economic, social, and institutional issues surrounding basic writers and the teaching of basic writing.” [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_bwwwt.html#50]

To be fair, we should note that Lu’s critique applied to other big names in the field of BW including Mike Rose (see below).

Other notable scholars of BW, however, like Laura Gray-Rosendale have claimed that such critiques of Shaughnessy do not hold much critical weight. “Shaughnessy’s works,” themselves, she claims, “render ambiguous if not outright defy many such negative characterizations.” [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_bwwwt.html#50]. Also, David Bartholomae (see below) has defended Shaughnessy’s emphasis on error in BW students’ writing (though he still advocates refocusing BW to help students learn various academic dialects). Adjusting the focus a bit, “Bartholomae extends Mina Shaughnessy's hope that teachers, especially basic writing teachers, will examine how they view errors in student writing. For example, he suggests that teachers who cannot understand student prose do not read the prose as complex texts and thus do not find the logic at work in many errors.” [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_bwwwt.html#43]

===David Bartholomae===

[[David Bartholomae]] is Professor of English and Chair of the English Department at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Bartholomae’s most-referenced publication about BW is the book chapter “Inventing the University.” The following is a selection from that chapter:

:“Every time a student sits down to write for us, he has to invent the university for the occasion--invent the university, that is, or a branch of it, like history or anthropology or economics or English. The student has to learn to speak our language, to speak as we do, to try on the peculiar ways of knowing, selecting, evaluating, reporting, concluding, and arguing that define the discourse of our community. Or perhaps I should say the various discourses of our community, since it is in the nature of a liberal arts education that a student, after the first year or two, must learn to try on a variety of voices and interpretive schemes--to write, for example, as a literary critic one day and as an experimental psychologist the next; to work within fields where the rules governing the presentation of examples or the development of an argument are both distinct and, even to the professional, mysterious. The student has to appropriate (or be appropriated by) a specialized discourse, and he has to do this as though he were easily and comfortably one with his audience, as though he were a member of the academy or an historian or an anthropologist or an economist; he has to invent the university by assembling and mimicking its language while finding some compromise between idiosyncrasy, a personal history, on the one hand, and the requirements of convention, the history of a discipline, on the other hand. He must learn to speak our language. Or he must dare to speak it or to carry off the bluff, since speaking and writing will most certainly be required long before the skill is ‘learned.’ And this, understandably, causes problems.” [http://www.wiu.edu/users/mfbhl/elgin/bartholome.htm]

Bartholomae asserts that (though important) error should not determine the efforts of or relationship between BW teachers and their students. Rather, BW teachers should recognize that the language they demand from their BW students (typically short, direct, non-abstruse sentences) is not the language that they (the teachers) typically write and publish in. Students experience such disconnect between what they learn from their writing classes and what their discipline specific course require of them that they are often left to their own devices to figure out how to write acceptably in any given discipline. To resolve this, Bartholomae believes that BW teachers should immerse their students with academic writing (peer reviewed journal articles, book chapters, etc.). BW students thus get healthy exposure to sufficient sums of “academic” language in a teacher-assisted environment. This, Bartholomae claims, should help BW students make the transition more quickly to start writing “academically.” The idea that academics might personally strive to exhibit a clear, cogent, and elegant style in their articles and chapters, and thus model good writing for their students to emulate, is not entertained.

===Mike Rose===

[[Mike Rose (educator)|Mike Rose]] is Professor of Social Research Methodology at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. He is best known in the BW community for his part autobiographical/part pedagogically philosophical book, ‘‘Lives on the Boundary.’’

: “This examination of the idea of ‘underpreparedness’ in a range of educational schools and systems also explores Rose's own experiences as a student who was erroneously placed in the vocational education track. He suggests that lower-track classes create a self-fulfilling prophesy for most students who might, if challenged to succeed, do well in advanced classes. Among the issues Rose discusses are the problems encountered by students whose improvised backgrounds provide little context for the ideas and language they encounter in the academy. By explaining his personal challenges and his experiences with various mentors, Rose illustrates how he worked to master academic language and ideas. Rose uses his experiences as a student and a teacher as evidence for a critique of conceptions of literacy used in contemporary education. He suggests that students labeled "underprepared" are inexperienced with the expectations of the academy, that literacy crises running through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were manufactured and deflect other concerns, and that schools must work with students differently.” [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_res.html#111]

Rose’s main interests in the study of thinking and learning include the, “study of the factors – cognitive, linguistic, socio-historical, and cultural – that enhance or limit people's engagement with written language.” As well as, “The development of pedagogies and materials to enhance critical reading and writing, particularly at the secondary and post-secondary level, and particularly with ‘underprepared’ or ‘at risk’ populations.” [https://web.archive.org/web/20070208184325/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/members/mrose]

Additionally, Rose has argued for the term basic writing as opposed to the terms "developmental" or "remedial" which have the connotations of medical terminology:

"This atomistic, medical model of language is simply not supported by more recent research in language and cognition. But because the teaching of writing – particularly teaching designated remedial has been conceptually, and [...] administratively segmented from the rich theoretical investigation that characterizes other humanistic study, these assumptions have rarely been subjected to rigorous and comprehensive scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=Mike|title=Lives on the Boundary|year=1989|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0140124039|pages=210–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle Dress Uniform''' ('''BDU''') are camouflaged [[Battledress|fatigues]] that were used by the [[United States Armed Forces]] as their standard combat uniform from the early 1980s to the mid-2000s&lt;!--(roughly September 1981 to April 2005)--&gt;. Since then, it has been replaced or supplanted in every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.

BDU-style uniforms and derivatives still see widespread use in other countries (some of them being former U.S. surplus stocks transferred under U.S. security assistance programs), while others are still worn by some U.S. federal, state and local [[law enforcement in the United States|law enforcement agencies]] or activities who may work in tactical situations, such as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration#Foreign-deployed Advisory and Support Teams|DEA FAST]] and [[SWAT]] teams.

As late as 2014, BDUs were worn by officers of the [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|U.S. Public Health Service]] as the prescribed uniform for deployment, but have since been replaced by a variant of the U.S. Coast Guard's [[Operational Dress Uniform]].

While the [[Italian Army]] was the first military organization to issue [[camouflage]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;d clothing, albeit in limited numbers, the Germans were noted for their efforts in this field before the Second World War. After much trial, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (abbrev. OKW) authorized [[Splittermuster|Heeres-Splittermuster 31]], more commonly known as "[[Splinter pattern camouflage|splinter pattern]]", for use in shelter-quarters (''[[Zeltbahn]]en'') in the 1930s. In 1940, SS-Verfügungstruppe (abbrev. SS-VT; renamed [[Waffen-SS]]) designed, tested and issued its own distinctive patterns and layout not long after.

The [[United States Marine Corps]] received its first [[military camouflage]] pattern in 1942, when the reversible, beach-jungle, three- and five-color frog-skin pattern uniform was issued, based on a 1940 trial design. The pattern was mostly employed in the Pacific Theatre, but was not found to be particularly effective and in the European Theatre the pattern was withdrawn altogether in 1944—in part because of anticipated friendly fire incidents after [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], due to its similarity to the Waffen SS's pattern (Not to be confused with [[Flecktarn]], a modern design.) Camouflaged helmet covers and shelters were issued in the 1950s in "wine leaf" and "brown cloud" patterns. The U.S. Army also tried a lesser-known camouflage uniform on D-Day and throughout the Normandy operations, like the Marine Corps' uniforms, but it was replaced by the M43 uniform before being used much.

During the [[Vietnam War]], the United States Armed Forces' four-color ERDL pattern saw limited use among specialist units in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], though most were issued the solid olive green [[OG107]] sateens or jungle fatigues, while the Marines adopted the pattern service-wide after 1968.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The ERDL pattern fatigues were identical in cut to the third-pattern OD jungle fatigues, and were available in both a highland pattern (more brown), and a lowland pattern (more green), though the lowland pattern was eventually phased out. Other, unofficial, patterns utilized in Vietnam included black-dyed or spray painted jungle fatigues, often used by special purpose forces, and various [[Republic of Vietnam|Vietnam]]ese [[Tigerstripe]] patterns (themselves being based on [[French Army]] airborne and [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] patterns and a British design utilized in Malaysia&lt;!-- Is this true? Citation? --&gt;), or commercial "duck hunter" patterns.

The general design and configuration of the U.S. BDU uniform was similar to that of [[Vietnam War]]'s jungle fatigues, which were in turn similar in configuration to specialty uniforms worn by U.S. paratroopers during [[World War II]].

==History==

First issued in limited number to garrison leaders, officers and generals to all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces in September 1981 for replacement of the long worn and aging Olive Drab colored uniforms or [[OG-107]], the following month in October, the Battle Dress Uniform began field issue military wide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olive-drab.com/od_soldiers_clothing_bdu_.php.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1981, changes included the addition and subsequent elimination of buttoned waist adjustment tabs, the size reduction of the collar, and refinements in stitching and fit.

BDUs were initially only issued in a 50/50 nylon and cotton twill blend, called the Temperate Weather BDU, or TWBDU. Complaints regarding the heat retention of these uniforms, especially following the invasion of Grenada in 1983, led to the introduction of the Hot Weather BDU, the HWBDU. The Hot Weather BDU coat and trousers were constructed of 100 percent ripstop cotton, in a four-color woodland camouflage pattern. However, after complaints of shorter wear and frayed cuffs, along with requirements imposed by unit commanders to [[starch]] the all-cotton uniform for parade, the Enhanced Hot Weather BDU (EHWBDU) replaced the HWBDU commencing in 1996. The EHWBDU's components are made with 50/50 ripstop nylon and cotton poplin blend.

BDUs were printed with infrared-brightened dyes. [[Near infrared]] (NIR) Signature Management Technology is used in the uniforms to help prevent detection by NIR Image Converters. These photocathode devices do not detect temperatures, but rather infrared radiation variances. NIR-compliant uniforms use a special fabric that allows soldiers to appear at the same radiation level as the surrounding terrain, thus making them more difficult to detect. It is advised not to use starch when cleaning or ironing BDUs, since starch weakens the fabric and ruins the infrared protective coating. A pair of BDUs that has been starched even once should not be worn in combat.

The tropical weight uniform was not as durable as the temperate weight uniform.  The tropical uniform would only last for 4–6 months of use when rotating four uniforms for duty, while the temperate uniform would last over a year under the same conditions.

===U.S. Army===
All [[United States Army]] soldiers formally received their first batches of the BDU as its new field and garrison uniform in the temperate weight cut on October 1, 1981. In addition, Patrol caps, boonie hats and the [[M-1965 field jacket|M-65 jacket]] were issued in the new camouflage pattern in time, including a new light brown T-shirt and black webbed belt with brass buckle.

The BDU was the first camouflage uniform approved by the U.S. Army since the Vietnam War, where the [[ERDL pattern]] was in limited use. The BDU soon replaced all earlier camouflage pattern uniforms for all wooded, jungle, and tropical environments, and by 1989, had completely replaced the standard [[OG107|olive drab]] uniforms that had been used since 1952.

===U.S. Marine Corps===
The ERDL-patterned BDU was first introduced to the United States Marine Corps in 1977, as they phased out the Olive Drab Green (OD) uniform. The BDU became the issued uniform for the U.S. Army in September 1981 in the [[woodland camouflage]] pattern, to begin replacing the Olive Drab Green (OD) or OG-107 colored fatigues, which had been standard wear since the early 1950s. The change was to better conceal Marines and Soldiers effectively in woodland or tropical Areas of Operation with macro shaped patterns, as opposed to OD, which had only a single shade of green. It was based primarily on the woodland colors specifically of northern Europe. It used shades of green, brown, tan, and black, initially printed onto cotton-nylon blend twill cloth, known as the "Temperate Weight" uniform. A newer lightweight "Tropical Weight" BDU uniform was introduced in 1987 with the pattern printed on 100% cotton rip-stop poplin cloth, to better prevent smaller rips from enlarging.

Originally, no nametapes were worn with the USMC's BDUs, which was officially referred to by the USMC as a "camouflage utility uniform" during its usage. However, in October 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Marine uniforms to include name tapes|last=Dolt|first=Kevin|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Hawaii_Marine_%28October_1991%29.pdf|work=Hawaii Marine|volume=20|number=43|date=October 31, 1991|page=A-4|accessdate=March 12, 2017|quote=The wearing of nametapes on the utility uniform will become mandatory by Oct. 1, 1992, and to help defray the costs involved in getting them sewed on, Headquarters Marine Corps authorized a one-time payment of $24 to all enlisted active-duty Marines, which was included in the Oct. 15 paycheck.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.militarytraining.net/Cpl%20Course/Classes/Slide%20shows/CPL0106%20Inspection%20Preparation%20Sgt%20Stuart.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slideplayer.com/slide/4312149/|title=INSPECTION PREPARATION CPL NCO’S ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPERVISING THE PREPARATION FOR AN INSPECTION. -  ppt download|website=slideplayer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.slideshare.net/Annie05/inspection-preparation-sgt-stuart-presentation&lt;/ref&gt; the USMC began the wearing of nametapes on their BDUs (and DCUs and DBDUs) in order to comply with NATO [[Standardization Agreement]] (STANAG), becoming mandatory by October 1992. In the USMC's case, a nametape bearing the wearer's last name was worn embroidered above the right pocket, and a nametape reading "U.S. MARINES" being embroidered was worn above the left pocket. The [[MCCUU]] which replaced the BDU continues this.

The USMC's BDU was worn with a stenciled ironed-on [[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]] (EGA) centered on the wearer's left breast pocket, below the pocket flap. Early USMC BDUs featured "USMC" lettering below that EGA, however, that was discontinued later on, with only the sole EGA being used by the end of the BDU's tenure with the USMC. The EGA was ironed-on to the BDU blouse pocket by USMC recruits at the end of MCRD upon completion of their training to signify their christening as U.S. Marines. The same was done on the eight-point "[[utility cover]]" hat that was worn with the USMC's version of the BDU. The BDU's successor, the MCCUU, has the EGA embroidered instead of stenciled on the blouse and all hats.

===U.S. Air Force===
Airmen of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] initially only issued its ERDL BDUs to over seas stationed combat arms units such as [[United States Air Force Security Forces]],  [[Combat Controllers]], and [[United States Air Force Pararescue]] PJs October 1, 1981, the same time as the Army and Marines. The Air Force did not allow non combat arms [[Air Force Speciality Codes]] wear the woodland pattern BDU until the summer of 1987, and mandate them as the only "Fatigue" uniform until 1988.

===U.S. Navy===
Sailors of the [[United States Navy]] started issuing the BDU in the new woodland scheme and temperate cut the same time as the other branches. The U.S. Navy referred to the uniform as the "Camouflage Utility Uniform" (CUU) during its usage.

===U.S. Coast Guard===
Coast Guardsmen started issuing the new woodland BDU around the same time as the other service branches.

== Successors ==

[[File:Fort polk op for training.jpg|thumb|U.S. soldiers in 2006 wearing BDUs while on a training exercise in Louisiana; the BDU was authorized by the U.S. Army until 2008.]]
The [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] has run trials of many camouflage patterns (some being used by foreign militaries), and issued environment-specific uniforms, notably the six-color [[Desert Battle Dress Uniform]] (DBDU),  nicknamed the "chocolate chip camouflage", designed in 1962, and the "[[Night Camouflage Desert|nighttime desert grid]]" (NCDBDU). Both uniforms were used in 1991, during the [[Persian Gulf War]]. These Desert BDUs were discontinued after the war.

The [[Desert Camouflage Uniform]] (DCU) in three-color desert camouflage were introduced in 1992, and was utilized in operations in Somalia (1993); it was in service in Afghanistan and Iraq from the start of hostilities, but the [[U.S. Army]] and [[U.S. Marine Corps]] have both replaced the DCU with newer uniforms ([[Army Combat Uniform|ACU]] and [[MCCUU]], respectively). In testing, U.S. Army researchers found that, as in other environments, the color of desert terrain varies, and can range from pink to blue, depending on the minerals in the soil and the time of the day. Since patches of uniform color in the desert are usually 10 times larger than those in wooded areas, it was decided to alter the existing six-color DBDU pattern. This led to the development of a three-color pattern DCU, which was adopted.

===U.S. Marine Corps===
The development of modern camouflage patterns and the rising desire of the various U.S. military branches to differentiate themselves from each other has resulted in new patterns for uniforms. The [[U.S. Marine Corps]] was the first branch to replace their BDUs. The [[Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform]] (MCCUU) uses the computer-generated [[MARPAT]] pattern and several other enhancements. It was approved for wear in June 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marines.mil/News/Messages/Messages-Display/Article/887056/combat-utility-uniform-and-boot-guidance/|title=COMBAT UTILITY UNIFORM AND BOOT GUIDANCE|publisher=The Official United States Marine Corps Public Website|date=May 20, 2002|access-date=November 7, 2017|work=ALMAR 028/02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020204012448/http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/camouflage010620.html|title=ABCNEWS.com : Marines Get Permanent Press Battle Dress|date=February 4, 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; became available for purchase in 2002, and the changeover was completed by October 1, 2004. The BDU was authorized for wear until April 1, 2005 in limited exceptions for those small numbers of Marines who did not yet have the MCCUU. USMC Special Operations units ([[MARSOC]]) have recently issued M81 woodland-patterned uniforms to supplement MARPAT uniforms for special missions.

===U.S. Army===
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 000119-A-4385T-005.jpg|thumb|upright|A U.S. Army medical officer wears a BDU when examining a man's eyes in January 2000.]]
In 2004, the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] unveiled the [[Army Combat Uniform]] (ACU), its successor to the BDU. From late 2005 to early 2007, the U.S. Army undertook the process of replacing the BDU with the ACU, with the BDU being formally discontinued by the army in October 2006.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Army Junior ROTC followed suit thereafter in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;lionsbattalion.weebly.com/uploads/8/7/2/8/8728410/how_to_wear_the_acu.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;

The original version of the ACU uniform used a [[Military camouflage#Digital camouflage|pixelated "digital" pattern]] known as the [[Universal Camouflage Pattern]] (UCP). UCP is similar to MARPAT, but uses more neutral, less saturated colors. The neutral colors, primarily foliage green and sand yellow, are designed to be work best in desert, woodland, and urban combat situations. The ACU in UCP was used by the army in all environments except for areas with [[snow]], as the UCP pattern works poorly against white despite the heavy use of grey. An all-white BDU and the [[Extended Cold Weather Clothing System|ECWCS]] are used instead for winterized warfare.

===U.S. Navy===
From 2004 to 2007, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] began issuing a pixelated blue and gray "digital" pattern [[Navy Working Uniform]] (NWU) in limited quantities on an experimental basis. While the NWU is neither a tactical uniform nor a battle dress uniform, it is intended to take the place of many existing work ensembles (utilities, wash khaki, coveralls, M81 BDU, etc.). The disruptive pattern is primarily intended to complement U.S. Navy ship colors and to hide stains and wear, and supposedly to make the wearer a less obvious visual target for hostile forces while working aboard a naval vessel in port.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Strategy Page, Military Photos: The New Navy Work Uniform|date=2004|url=http://www.strategypage.com/military_photos/200410230.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet the Navy's cold-weather requirements, the NWU includes a fleece jacket, pullover sweater, and parka options. U.S. Navy SEALs, Seabees, and other U.S. Navy personnel deployed ashore under the cognizance of [[U.S. Naval Forces Central Command]] used "M81" woodland BDUs (referred to by the navy as CCUs)&lt;ref&gt;https://media.defense.gov/2017/Mar/06/2001707436/-1/-1/0/CI_1020_10A.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; and DCUs for outdoor operations or activities in specific areas of responsibility (AOR), until the issuance of the NWU Type III in the AOR camouflage pattern.

===U.S. Air Force===
In 2004 and 2005, the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] experimented with, but rejected, a blue-toned [[tigerstripe]] uniform. In 2006, a new BDU-style uniform called the ''[[Airman Battle Uniform]]'' (ABU) was adopted, using a semi-pixelated tiger pattern with four soft earth tones consisting of tan, grey, green and blue. It failed, however, to incorporate many of the significant improvements of the ACU and MCCUU. By 2007, it was in current production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123017545|title=News|website=www.af.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, responding to criticism that the new Airman Battle Uniform was too heavy and hot in high-temperature environments, the USAF's 648th Aeronautical Systems Squadron at [[Brooks City-Base]] revealed plans to switch to a lighter, more breathable fabric for the combat blouse section of the ABU. The original heavyweight nylon-cotton blend was changed to a lighter-weight nylon-cotton poplin material. Priority will go to those serving in the Middle East or other hot-weather theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Winn, Patrick, ''Better, Lighter ABU Blouse Is On The Way'', ''Air Force Times'', May 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 2016, the [[National Commander of the Civil Air Patrol]] announced the USAF's approval for the [[Civil Air Patrol]] to begin its transition to the Airman Battle Uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAP Transition to the Airman Battle Uniform (ABU)|url=http://www.capmembers.com/media/cms/CAP_Transition_to_ABUs_06DC64FB17483.pdf|website=capmembers.com|accessdate=May 9, 2016|page=1|language=English|format=PDF|date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2018, the Air Force announced the adoption of the Army's [[Operational Camouflage Pattern]] uniform, however, insignia will be distinctive. Transition is to be complete by April 1, 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Air Force transitions to a single combat uniform| accessdate = May 15, 2018 | date = May 14, 2018| url = http://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1520066/air-force-transitions-to-a-single-combat-uniform/ | last1 = Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs | publisher = US Air Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Coast Guard===
The [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] has introduced the new [[Operational Dress Uniform]] (ODU) uniform in 2004 to replace the winter and summer "Undress Duty" uniform. Resembling the BDU, the ODU retains the basic design of the old-style BDU uniforms, but with the lower pockets on the blouse being eliminated. The sleeves can be worn "folded up" in a manner similar to the old U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force BDUs (since disallowed with the Army ACU) and the trousers "bloused" into the boots (unless boating shoes are worn, as is common for the [[U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary]], which patrols for the Coast Guard aboard privately owned watercraft), with the ODU black belt and blackened buckle being worn with the metal tip two to four inches from the buckle. The ODU is also issued in a single blue color as opposed to any camouflage pattern.

The dark blue Coast Guard unit [[baseball]]-style cap is worn with this uniform. The ODU also has all of its allowable insignia sewn on, eliminating the chance of puncture wounds created by the pins if the individual suffers a blow to the chest while wearing a [[personal flotation device|PFD]] or body armor. The ODU is not intended to be worn by Coast Guard units which engage in combat operations or are deployed overseas. These units continued to wear older woodland BDU and [[Desert Camouflage Uniform|DCU]] uniforms before adopting the Navy Work Uniform for USCG units overseas or part of other DoD operations.

The BDU in [[MultiCam]] camouflage is in use today mainly by the public, public service persons, and some foreign military units. BDUs can be purchased from civilian vendors in the UCP pattern analogous to the ACU as well, but these are not authorized for wear by U.S. Army soldiers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4235">'''Botany 500''' is a brand of [[menswear]] and suits that was originally part of a firm based in [[New York City]]. The name lives on today as a licensed property by several foreign clothing manufacturers.

==Manufacturing==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
Botany 500 was a brand name owned by the Botany 500 Group of New York. Their men’s suits and sport coats were manufactured in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], by H. Daroff and Sons, who were contracted with [[Botany Mills]] of [[Passaic, New Jersey]] to produce products and later bought the firm outright. Their plant was located at 23rd and Walnut Streets during the 1940s and ’50s and beyond. Until 1945, it was located in the [[Pitcairn Building]] at 1027 Arch Street. They also produced another suit called worsted tex that had the image of the head of a [[German Shepherd]] dog on its label. The office, on the first floor of the plant, had a stuffed German shepherd standing guard. The seventh and topmost floor contained the top coat design department and a fabric cutting floor.

===Decline===

Daroff and Sons and the Botany 500 group went bankrupt in August 1973. An attempt was made to turn the company over to another company, named Cohen and Sons, which was still operating profitably. Because of resistance by the company's employees, Cohen backed out of the deal by the end of September. When Daroff finally closed its doors in December 1973, Cohen and Sons bought the Botany 500 name and assets for $4 million. They planned to keep the labels, marketing, sales, and distribution of Botany as a separate Botany 500 line.

With the garment business taking a downturn during the second half of the decade, the Botany and Cohen and Sons operations ceased production in 1986. The building was sold in 1989 for $1,750,000. Manufacturing under Botany 500 name was then outsourced to foreign companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://botany500building-philly.tumblr.com/#_ftn1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion==
Botany 500 provided wardrobe for many game show hosts and television presenters, including [[Phil Donahue]] of ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLJbtVZWOiY&amp;feature=autoplay&amp;list=PL4C67F54010391D4B&amp;lf=plpp_video&amp;playnext=4 ''The Phil Donahue Show''], 1980 interview with economist [[Milton Friedman]]. The credit is visible at 6:55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the company also provided the wardrobes for [[Joey Bishop]] on [[The Joey Bishop Show (talk show)|''The Joey Bishop Show,'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=DwighttFrye|title=Joey Bishop Show|date=2016-04-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAKJsD4LhE|accessdate=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danny Thomas]] on ''[[Make Room for Daddy]]'', [[John Newland]] on ''[[Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond]]'', [[Dick Van Dyke]] on ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'',  [[Don Adams]] on ''[[Get Smart]]'', [[Mike Connors]] on ''[[Mannix]]'', [[Telly Savalas]] on ''[[Kojak]]'', [[Bob Newhart]] on ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Bob Newhart Show'', Season 2, end credits. [[Suzanne Pleshette]]'s wardrobe was provided by Judy's.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dick Sargent]] on ''[[Bewitched]]'', [[Brian Keith]] and [[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]] on ''[[Family Affair]],'' [[Sherman Hemsley]] on ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', [[Lyle Waggoner]] on ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', [[Peter Graves]] on ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'', [[Jack Klugman]] on ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'', and [[Bill Macy]] and [[Conrad Bain]] on ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]''. [[Ryan O'Neal|Ryan O’Neal’s]] wardrobe was furnished by Botany 500 in his movie ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'', [[Jim Perry (television personality)|Jim Perry]] on ''[[Card Sharks]]'', [[Bill Cullen]] on ''[[Blockbusters (U.S. game show)|Blockbusters]]'', [[Bob Eubanks]] on ''[[The New Newlywed Game]]'', and [[Richard Dawson]] on ''[[Family Feud]]''. The classic TV series ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'' listed Worsted Tex in its closing credits (essentially dressing [[Jack Klugman]] for two series).

'''Compulsive buying disorder''' ('''CBD'''), or '''oniomania''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὤνιος ''ṓnios'' "for sale" and μανία ''manía'' "insanity"&lt;ref&gt;OMD. (2000, March 5). Retrieved January 16, 2008, from http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?oniomania&lt;/ref&gt;), is characterized by an obsession with [[shopping]] and buying behavior that causes adverse consequences. According to Kellett and Bolton,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; compulsive buying "is experienced as an irresistible–uncontrollable urge, resulting in excessive, expensive and time-consuming retail activity [that is] typically prompted by negative affectivity" and results in "gross social, personal and/or financial difficulties".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kellett S., Bolton J. V. | year = 2009 | title = Compulsive buying : A cognitive-behavioural model | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 83–99 | doi=10.1002/cpp.585| pmid = 19229837 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most people with CBD meet the criteria for a [[personality disorder]]. Compulsive shopping is classified by [[ICD-10]] (F63.8) as an "[[impulse control disorder]], not otherwise classified." Several authors consider compulsive shopping rather as a variety of dependence disorder.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17123121]

==History==
[[Emil Kraepelin]] originally described oniomania 1924,&lt;ref name="BLACK 14–18"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A review of compulsive buying disorder|first=DONALD W|last=BLACK|date=1 February 2007|publisher=|journal=World Psychiatry|volume=6|issue=1|pages=14–18|pmid=17342214|pmc=1805733}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he and [[Eugen Bleuler|Bleuler]] both included the syndrome in their influential early psychiatric textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Frances et al., ''Clinical Textbook of Addictive Disorders'' (2005) p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; However, little interest was taken in CBD until the 1990s,&lt;ref name="BLACK 14–18"/&gt; and even in the 21st century compulsive shopping can be considered a barely recognised mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Jon E. Grant/S. W. Kim, ''Stop Me Because I Can't Stop Myself'' (2004) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
CBD is frequently [[comorbidity|comorbid]] with [[mood disorder|mood]], [[anxiety]], [[substance abuse]] and [[eating disorders]]. People who score highly on compulsive buying scales tend to understand their feelings poorly and have low tolerance for unpleasant psychological states such as negative moods.&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rose |first=Paul  |title=Difficulty Identifying Feelings, Distress Tolerance and Compulsive Buying: Analyzing the Associations to Inform Therapeutic Strategies|journal=International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction |volume=11 |issue=1 |date=June 2012 |pages=65–68 |doi=10.1007/s11469-012-9389-y |issn=1557-1874 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-012-9389-y?null |last2=Segrist |first2=Daniel J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onset of CBD occurs in the late teens and early twenties and is generally [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]]. CBD is similar to, but distinguished from, [[Compulsive hoarding|OCD hoarding]] and [[mania]]. Compulsive buying is not limited to people who spend beyond their means; it also includes people who spend an inordinate amount of time shopping or who chronically think about buying things but never purchase them. Promising treatments for CBD include medication such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), and support groups such as [[Debtors Anonymous]].&lt;ref name="HARTSTON2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hartston |first=Heidi J. |title=Impulsive behavior in a consumer culture |journal=International Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice |volume=6 |issue=2 |date=June 2002 |pages=65–68 |doi=10.1080/136515002753724045 |pmid=24931930 |issn=1471-1788 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a713750566 |last2=Koran |first2=Lorrin M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BLACK2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Black |first=Donald W. |title=Compulsive Buying Disorder: Definition, Assessment, Epidemiology and Clinical Management. |journal=CNS Drugs |year=2001 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=17–27 |pmid=11465011 |issn=1172-7047 |oclc=30488303 |doi=10.2165/00023210-200115010-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BLACK2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Black |first=Donald W. |title=A review of compulsive buying disorder |journal=World Psychiatry |date=February 2007 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=14–18 |pmid=17342214 |issn=1723-8617 |oclc=55586799 |pmc=1805733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vyse"&gt;{{cite book |last=Vyse |first=Stuart |title=Going broke: why Americans can't hold on to their money |publisher=Oxford University Press  |oclc=153773333 |isbn=0-19-530699-6 |location=Oxford; New York |year=2008 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions==

The terms compulsive shopping, compulsive buying, and compulsive spending are often used interchangeably, but the behaviors they represent are in fact distinct. (Nataraajan and Goff 1992) {{Page needed|date=September 2010}} One may buy without shopping, and certainly shop without buying: of compulsive shoppers, some 30% described the act of buying itself as providing a buzz,&lt;ref&gt;Helga Dittmar, "Understanding and Diagnosing Compulsive Buying", in Robert H. Coombs, ''Handbook of Addictive Disorders'' (2004) p. 438&lt;/ref&gt; irrespective of the goods purchased.

==Causes==
CBD often has roots in early experience. [[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionism]], general impulsiveness and compulsiveness, dishonesty, insecurity, and the need to gain control have also been linked to the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;April Lane Benson, ''I Shop Therefore I Am'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Black, A review of compulsive buying disorder (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Compulsive buying seems to represent a search for self in people whose identity is neither firmly felt nor dependable, as indicated by the way purchases often provide social or personal identity-markers. &lt;ref&gt;Aboujaourde/Koran, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Those with associated disorders such as anxiety, depression and poor impulse control are particularly likely to be attempting to treat symptoms of low self-esteem through compulsive shopping.&lt;ref&gt;April Lane Benson/Marie Gengler, "Treating Compulsive Buying" in Coombs, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, however, object that such psychological explanations for compulsive buying do not apply to ''all'' people with CBD.&lt;ref&gt;Aboujaourde/Koran, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Social conditions also play an important role in CBD, the rise of consumer culture contributing to the view of compulsive buying as a specifically [[postmodern]] addiction, particularly with regard to internet buying platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Dittmar, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;

Readily available [[credit card]]s enable casual spending beyond one's means, and some would suggest that the compulsive buyer should lock up or destroy credit cards altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Hayes, ''Beyond the Silicon Curtain'' (1989) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; [[Online shopping]] also facilitates CBD, with online auction addiction, used to escape feelings of depression or guilt, becoming a recognisable problem.&lt;ref&gt;Elen Lewis, ''The eBay Phenomenon'' (2008) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

What differentiates CBD from healthy shopping is the compulsive, destructive and chronic nature of the buying. Where shopping can be a positive route to self-expression, in excess it represents a dangerous threat.&lt;ref&gt;April Lane Benson and Marie Gengler, "Treating Compulsive Buying", in Coombs, p. 452&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materialism and image seeking==

A [[social psychological]] perspective suggests that compulsive buying may be seen as an exaggerated form of a more normal search for validation through purchasing.&lt;ref&gt;Helga Dittmar/Emma Halliwell, ''Consumer Culture, Identity and Well-being'' (2008) p. 95-7&lt;/ref&gt; Also, pressures from the spread of materialist values and [[consumer culture]] over the recent decades can drive people into compulsive shopping.&lt;ref name="Dittmar/Halliwell, p. 97"&gt;Dittmar/Halliwell, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Globalization|global]] context where we are all encouraged to "shop till we drop"&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Diski, ''The Sixties'' (London 2009) p. 18-20&lt;/ref&gt;—compulsive shopping inevitably poses the further question, "Minority pathology or Mass problem?"&lt;ref name="Dittmar/Halliwell, p. 97"/&gt; With advertisements offering not so much products as narratives (of success, glamour) to identify with,&lt;ref&gt;William Gibson, ''Zero History'' (London 2010) p. 21 and p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; compulsive buying may seem only an extreme aspect of what consumer culture demands from us all.&lt;ref name="Dittmar/Halliwell, p. 119"&gt;Dittmar/Halliwell, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms and course==

Diagnostic criteria for compulsive buying have been proposed: 

1. Over-preoccupation with buying. 

2. Distress or impairment as a result of the activity. 

3. Compulsive buying is not limited to [[hypomania|hypomanic]] or [[mania|manic]] episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Frances, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

While initially triggered by a perhaps mild need to feel special, the failure of compulsive shopping to actually meet such needs may lead to a vicious cycle of escalation,&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Klaffke, ''Spree'' (2004) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; with sufferers experiencing the highs and lows associated with other [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]]s.&lt;ref name="Klaffke, p. 185"&gt;Klaffke, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; The 'high' of the purchasing may be followed by a sense of disappointment, and of guilt,&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Costigan, ''Women and Healing'' (2006) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; precipitating a further cycle of impulse buying.&lt;ref&gt;Helga Dittmar, "Understanding and Diagnosing Compulsive Buying", in Robert H. Coombs, ''Handbook of Addictive Disorders'' (2004) p. 442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver James, ''Britain on the Couch'' (London 1998) p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; With the now addicted person increasingly feeling negative emotions like [[anger]] and [[Stress (biological)|stress]], they may attempt to self-medicate through further purchases,&lt;ref&gt;Dittmar, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; followed again by [[Regret (emotion)|regret]] or [[Depression (mood)|depression]] once they return home,&lt;ref&gt;Dittmar, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; leading to an urge for buying more.

As debt grows, the compulsive shopping may become a more secretive act.&lt;ref name="Klaffke, p. 185"/&gt; At the point where bought goods are hidden or destroyed, because the person concerned feels so ashamed of their addiction, the price of the addiction in mental, financial and emotional terms becomes even higher.&lt;ref&gt;Catalano and Sonenberg, in Costigan, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

The consequences of compulsive buying, which may persist long after a spree, can be devastating, with marriages, long-term relationships, and jobs all feeling the strain.&lt;ref&gt;Klaffke, p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; Further problems can include ruined [[credit history]], [[theft]] or [[defalcation]] of [[money]], defaulted loans, general financial trouble and in some cases [[bankruptcy]] or extreme [[consumer debt|debt]], as well as [[anxiety]] and a sense of life spiraling out of control.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Zumo, ''Advances in quality of life research, 2001'' (2002) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting stress can lead to physical health problems and ruined relationships, or even [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant/Kim, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment involves becoming conscious of the addiction through studying, therapy and group work. 
Research done by Michel Lejoyeux and Aviv Weinstein suggests that the best possible treatment for CBD is through cognitive behavioral therapy. They suggest that a patient first be "evaluated for psychiatric comorbidity, especially with depression, so that appropriate pharmacological treatment can be instituted." Their research indicates that patients who received cognitive behavioral therapy over 10 weeks had reduced episodes of compulsive buying and spent less time shopping as opposed to patients who did not receive this treatment (251).

Lejoyeux and Weinstein also write about pharmacological treatment and studies that question the use of drugs on CB. They declare "few controlled studies have assessed the effects of pharmacological treatment on compulsive buying, and none have shown any medication to be effective." (252) The most effective treatment is to attend therapy and group work in order to prevent continuation of this addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/00952990.2010.493590|title=Compulsive Buying|journal=The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse|first1=Michel|last1=Lejoyeux|first2=Aviv|last2=Weinstein|date=1 September 2010|volume=36|issue=5|pages=248–253|doi=10.3109/00952990.2010.493590|pmid=20560822}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nrn1211|title=In the News: Retail therapy|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=4|issue=9|pages=700|year=2003|last1=Wood|first1=Heather}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s such as [[fluvoxamine]] and [[citalopram]] may be useful in the treatment of CBD, although current evidence is mixed.&lt;ref name="Aboujaoude2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aboujaoude|first1=Elias|title=Compulsive Buying Disorder: A Review and Update|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|volume=20|issue=25|year=2014|pages=4021–4025|issn=1381-6128|doi=10.2174/13816128113199990618|pmid=24001296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17342214"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Black DW | title = A review of compulsive buying disorder | journal = World Psychiatry | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–8 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17342214 | pmc = 1805733 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Opioid antagonist]]s such as [[naltrexone]] and [[nalmefene]] are promising potential treatments for CBD.&lt;ref name="Aboujaoude2014" /&gt; A review concluded that evidence is limited and insufficient to support their use at present, however.&lt;ref name="Piquet-PessôaFontenelle2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piquet-Pessôa|first1=Marcelo|last2=Fontenelle|first2=Leonardo F.|title=Opioid Antagonists In Broadly Defined Behavioral Addictions: A Narrative Review|journal=Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy|volume=17|issue=6|year=2016|pages=1–10|issn=1465-6566|doi=10.1517/14656566.2016.1145660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naltrexone and nalmefene have also shown effectiveness in the treatment of [[gambling addiction]], an associated disorder.&lt;ref name="Piquet-PessôaFontenelle2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YipPotenza2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yip|first1=Sarah W.|last2=Potenza|first2=Marc N.|title=Treatment of Gambling Disorders|journal=Current Treatment Options in Psychiatry|volume=1|issue=2|year=2014|pages=189–203|issn=2196-3061|doi=10.1007/s40501-014-0014-5|pmid=24904757|pmc=4041397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7902">'''Culture &amp; Social Cognition''' is the relationship between human culture and human [[cognitive]] capabilities.  Cultural cognitive [[evolution]] proposes that humans’ unique cognitive capacities are not solely due to biological inheritance, but are in fact due in large part to cultural transmission and evolution (Tomasello, 1999). Modern humans and [[great apes]] are separated evolutionarily by about six million years. Proponents of cultural evolution argue that this would not have been enough time for humans to develop the advanced cognitive capabilities required to create tools, language, and build societies through biological evolution. Biological evolution could not have individually produced each of these cognitive capabilities within that period of time. Instead, humans must have evolved the capacity to learn through cultural transmission (Tomasello, 1999). This provides a more plausible explanation that would fit within the given time frame. Instead of having to biologically account for each cognitive mechanism that distinguishes modern humans from previous relatives, one would only have to account for one significant biological adaptation for cultural learning. According to this view, the ability to learn through cultural transmission is what distinguishes humans from other primates (Tomasello, 1999). Cultural learning allows humans to build on existing knowledge and make collective advancements, also known as the “[[ratchet effect]]”. The ratchet effect simply refers to the way in which humans continuously add on to existing knowledge through modifications and improvements.  This unique ability distinguishes humans from related primates, who do not seem to build collaborative knowledge over time. Instead, primates seem to build individual knowledge, in which the expertise of one animal is not built on by others, and does not progress across time.

==Cultural learning==
Human cultural learning involves:
* Imitation- the ability to learn by observing others
* Instruction- the ability to learn through direct instruction
* Collaboration- the ability to learn in cooperation with other individuals
Cultural learning is made possible by a deep understanding of social cognition. Humans have the unique capacity to identify and relate to others and view them as intentional beings. Humans are able to understand that others have intentions, goals, desires, and beliefs. It is this deep understanding, this cognitive adaptation, that allows humans to learn from and with others through cultural transmission (Tomasello, 1999).

==Social Cognition in Mammals and Primates==
Primates show distinct characteristics of social cognition in comparison to mammals. Mammals are able to identify members of their species, understand basic kinships and basic social hierarchies, make predictions about others’ behavior based on emotion and movement, and engage in social learning (Tomasello, 1999).  Primates, however, show a more extensive understanding of these concepts. Primates not only understand kinship and social hierarchies, but they also have an understanding of relational categories. That is, primates are able to understand social relations that extend beyond their individual interaction with others. Mammals are able to form direct relationships based on social hierarchies, but primates have an understanding of social hierarchies and relationships that extend beyond them personally. Researchers believe that this understanding of relational categories might have been the evolutionary precursor to humans’ deeper understanding of desires, beliefs, and goals underlying causal relationships, and thereby allowing humans to relate to and understand other individuals, making way for cultural evolution (Tomasello, 1999).

Although it is now believed that non-human primates such as chimpanzees have some limited understanding of others as intentional beings, it is clear that these understanding are not as deep as human understanding of others as intentional agents.  Chimpanzees, for example, demonstrated an ability to think about what others see, and predict behavior based on these beliefs in several studies conducted by Tomasello and Hare (2003). For example, subordinate chimpanzees in one experiment avoided food that they knew the dominant chimpanzee could see, but sought food that the dominant chimpanzee could not see due to a physical barrier. In another experiment, subordinate chimpanzees made decisions about approaching food based on whether or not the dominant chimpanzee had seen the human researcher place the food behind the barrier. Chimpanzees were also found to react differently to humans who were unwilling versus unable to provide food (teasing the chimpanzee with food, or pretending to have an accident with it), thereby showing some ability to discriminate intentionality.

Dogs have also shown some interesting but limited abilities at social cognition in a series of studies by Hare and Tomasello (2005). Dogs have the ability to read human social cues, even to a greater extent than chimpanzees. Dogs are able to respond to human pointing, the human gaze, and subtle human nods without training. Researchers now believe that these abilities are the result of convergent evolution between humans and dogs through domestication. Research with domesticated foxes has shown that the likely mechanism for this convergent evolution was the selection of tame behavior in dogs. This finding suggests that perhaps humans had to evolve a propensity to cooperate before cultural evolution was able to take place (Hare &amp; Tomasello, 2005).

==Sociogenesis &amp; Human Ontogeny==
Sociogenesis refers to collaborative inventiveness. It is the process by which two or more humans collectively interact and invent something new which could not have been developed by one individual alone, such as language and mathematics (Tomasello, 1999). Sociogenesis can occur across time, or simultaneously (Tomasello, 1999).  Socigenesis across times occurs through the ratchet effect, when one individual modifies something they had previously learned through others. Over time, ideas, tools, and language advance. Simultaneous sociogenesis occurs when two or more individuals work together at the same time and develop something new.

In response to the nature versus nurture and learned versus innate debate, proponents of cultural evolution argue that cognitive psychology must take into account historical processes when studying and discussion cognition (Tomasello, 1999). For example, the similarities between languages have led many researchers to decry that language or aspects of language must be innate. The extreme variability in math and counting systems across cultures has prevented similar conclusions for math. However, Tomasello argues that if you look at these concepts with historical processes in mind, another plausible explanation could be that language, but not math, developed before people split into different populations. Math developed only after such split, and because the cultural needs of these people differed, differential counting and mathematical systems resulted. The critique is that categorizing concepts as innate or learned does not tell us anything about the process by which they originally developed.

'''Damianos Sotheby’s International Realty''' is a luxury Bahamas real estate firm founded in 1945 by Nicholas G. Damianos. This Bahamian company was originally named Damianos Realty, but had a name change when they acquired the Sotheby's International Realty franchise in 2005. Damianos Sotheby’s International Realty is a member of the [[Bahamas Real Estate Association]] and the Bahamas MLS.

==Franchise Story==
[[Sotheby's]] Auction House was founded back in 1744 in [[London]] originally as an auctioneer of books. In 1976 [[Sotheby's International Realty]] was founded. The company operates as a franchise focusing on brokering and marketing of [[luxury real estate]].

In February 2004, [[Realogy]] Holdings (NYSE: [https://www.nyse.com/about/listed/lcddata.html?ticker=rlgy RLGY]), a real estate franchising and provider of real estate brokerage entered into a long-term alliance with Sotheby’s, the operator of the Auction House. The agreement provided for the licensing of the ''Sotheby’s International Realty'' name and the development of a full franchise system.

As of the end of 2013, the Sotheby’s International Realty network had more than 14,500 sales associates located in 700 offices in 52 countries and territories worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4796">'''Danka''' is a free cultural guide and network in [[Pakistan]], and a strong and independent tool to organize the communication of the cultural events in order to inform the public and establish the essential link between cultural life and public. 

The name “Danka” has been derived from a word in  [[Urdu]] and [[Hindi]] meaning drum used for announcement, usually used in the context of announcing something with a drum. In older days, the kings’ messengers used to make a public announcement by gathering people at one place by beating the drums.


== Mission statement == 
Danka aspires to develop a cultural networking spirit, i.e. active co-operation between artists, organizers and the public and cultural management to improve quality of the events, their communication and their organization. From the beginning on it has been an objective to provide the widest range of cultural activities in Pakistan. 

== History ==
The cultural platform, Danka was founded in 2005 as not-for-profit social initiative within the circle of the cultural center “Lahore Chitrkar”, a famous meeting point for artists and musicians back then. It was started with support of the Austrian NGO “proLoka” which designed it as a volunteer project and has been accompanied since then by the same organization. 

Danka is mainly a volunteer effort, and depends on the contribution of people sharing the same objectives. As such almost a hundred Danka volunteers have joined Danka since the start. Some of these volunteers were from abroad, some even came especially to Pakistan to work for Danka. Danka has a tradition of employing civil servants from Austria’s auslandsdienst.at

As such the platform was not limited to event-listing only, but also of locations where the events take place and the artists performing and it quickly became a networking and management effort dedicated to assist the cultural organizers and artists in their needs. 

=== Re-launch  ===
In 2011 proLoka developed an entirely new Danka portal, replacing the original website that had grown piece-by-piece, through contribution from volunteers, over the years. The new portal reflects Danka’s strong networking approach where the events uploaded are automatically linked to the venues were they take place and the artists’ pages list upcoming performances as well as their past events.

Today Danka’s activities range from event management, cultural restoration, exchange programmes, performing art classes and technical assistance to consultancy and marketing.

=== New projects ===
In 2011, Danka employed a more proactive approach by launching new projects supported by Danka itself i addition to - as so far - focusing on the communication and promotion of events. 

'''Danka Trips'''
Danka Trips is a platform that offers a chance to experience the rich culture of Pakistan by visiting various culturally significant spots in person. The project facilitates guided tours to different cultural centres within Pakistan, at subsidized rates, with an aim of cultural restoration and promotion at a collective level.

'''Women in Culture'''
Women in culture seeks to facilitate the involvement of women in cultural activities through a two-pronged strategy aiming to increase the number of women participation as the audience of art and cultural events as well as to develop and promote the profiles of female artists in Pakistan.

'''Danka Scholar'''
Danka is working on the launch of another project, Danka Scholar which will provide a platform for people from all walks of life to get an expertise in various performing art forms, at subsidized rates, under the tutelage of renowned musicians, dancers and artists who have been acknowledged as the gurus of the performing arts for many years.

Since the introduction of these new activities, it became more common to refer to Danka as “Pakistan’s Cultural Guide” instead of the previously used term “Pakistan’s Cultural Events Guide”.

== Danka's location ==
While having a focal point in Lahore, its birthplace and the cultural center of Pakistan, Danka is operational all over Pakistan, with an added focus on the other two major cities of Karachi and Islamabad. Events are listed from any city in Pakistan and artist profiles are as diverse as Lahori [[Kathak]] Dancers to Painter vom [[Khyber Agency]].

The '''Defining Issues Test''' or the '''DIT''' is a component model of [[moral development]] devised by [[James Rest]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="judgingmoralissues"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rest |first=James |authorlink=James Rest |title=Development in Judging Moral Issues |year=1979 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=0-8166-0891-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Minnesota formally established the Center for the Study of Ethical Development as a vehicle for research around this test in 1982.

The DIT uses a [[Likert scale|Likert-type scale]] to give quantitative ratings and rankings to issues surrounding five different moral dilemmas, or stories.  Specifically, respondents rate 12 issues in terms of their importance to the corresponding dilemma and then rank the four most important issues.  The issue statements that respondents respond to are not fully developed stances which fall on one side or another of the presented dilemma.  Rather, they are conceptualized as fragments of reasoning, to which respondents must project meaning.  Meaning is projected by means of moral reasoning schemas (each of which is explained below).  A schema is a [[mental representation]] of stimuli that has previously been encountered, which allows one to make sense of newly experienced, but related, stimuli.  So, when a respondent reads an issue statement that both makes sense to them, as well as triggers a preferred schema, that statement is given a high rating and ranking.  Conversely, when a respondent reads an issue statement that is either construed as nonsensical or overly simplistic, the item receives a low rating.  Patterns of ratings and rankings reveal information about three specific schemas of moral reasoning: the Personal Interests Schema, the Maintaining Norms Schema and the Postconventional Schema. 

The Personal Interests Schema is regarded as the least developmentally advanced level of moral reasoning.  In operating primarily at the Personal Interests level, the respondent takes into consideration what the protagonist of the story, or those close to the protagonist, has to gain or lose.  The Maintaining Norms Schema is considered more advanced than the Personal Interests Schema, as it emphasizes more than the individual.  

At the Maintaining Norms reasoning level, law and authority are important, as each of these helps to uphold social order, which is paramount to this schema.  So, a respondent who is predominantly using this schema will take into consideration what needs to be done in order to be compliant with the social order of society.  Finally, the Postconventional Schema is regarded as the most developmentally advanced.  

At the Postconventional reasoning level, laws are not simply blindly accepted (as with the Maintaining Norms Schema), but are scrutinized in order to ensure society-wide benefit.  So, a respondent who is primarily using this schema will focus on what is best for society as a whole.  For example, the Civil Rights movement was a product of Postconventional reasoning, as followers were most concerned with the society-wide effects of (in)equality.  

Though an individual may rely more heavily on one of the aforementioned schemas, moral reasoning is typically informed, to varying degrees, by each of the schemas.&lt;ref name="Moral Schemas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Narvaez |first=Darcia |authorlink=Darcia Narvaez |author2=Bock, T.|year=2002 |title=Moral schemas and tacit judgment or how the Defining Issues Test is supported by cognitive science |journal=[[Journal of Moral Education]] |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=297–314 |doi=10.1080/0305724022000008124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neo-Kohlbergian"&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Rest |first=James |authorlink=James Rest |author2=Narvaez, D. |author3=Thoma, S. |author4=Bebeau, M.  |year=2000 |title=A Neo-Kohlbergian approach to morality research |journal=Journal of Moral Education |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=381–395 |doi=10.1080/713679390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Defining Issues Test's original purposes was to assess the transition of moral development from [[adolescence]] to [[adulthood]]. In 1999 the test was revised in the DIT-2 for brevity, clarity and more powerful [[Validity (logic)|validity]] criteria.&lt;ref name="CSED"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ethicaldevelopment.ua.edu/about-the-dit.html |title=Center for the Study of Ethical Development |accessdate=2016-10-22 |format=Website |work=DIT_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DIT-2"&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Rest |first=James |authorlink=James Rest |author2=Narvaez, D. |author3=Bebeau, M. |author4=Thoma, S. |year=1999 |title=DIT-2: Devising and testing a new instrument of moral judgment |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=91 |issue=4 |pages=644–659 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.91.4.644 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DIT has been dubbed "Neo-Kohlbergian" by its constituents as it emphasizes [[cognition]], personal construction, development and [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|postconventional]] [[moral]] thinking - reflective of the work by [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] and his [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]].&lt;ref name="neokohlbergian"&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Rest |first=James |authorlink=James Rest |author2=Narvaez, D. |author3=Bebeau, M. |author4=Thoma, S. |year=1999 |title=A Neo-Kohlbergian Approach: The DIT and Schema Theory |journal=[[Educational Psychology Review]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=291–324 |doi=10.1023/A:1022053215271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="postconventional"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rest |first=James |authorlink=James Rest |author2=Narvaez, D. |author3=Bebeau, M. |author4=Thoma, S. |title=Postconventional Moral Thinking: A Neo-Kohlbergian Approach |year=1999 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=0-8058-3285-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Elliott Cresson Medal''', also known as the '''Elliott Cresson Gold Medal''', was the highest award given by the [[Franklin Institute]]. The award was established by [[Elliott Cresson]], life member of the Franklin Institute, with $1,000 granted in 1848.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; The endowed award was to be "for some discovery in the Arts and Sciences, or for the invention or improvement of some useful machine, or for some new process or combination of materials in manufactures, or for ingenuity skill or perfection in workmanship."&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; The medal was first awarded in 1875, 21 years after Cresson's death.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

The Franklin Institute continued awarding the medal on an occasional basis until 1998 when they reorganized their endowed awards under one umbrella, [[The Franklin Institute Awards|The Benjamin Franklin Awards]].&lt;ref name="Facts"/&gt; A total of 268 Elliott Cresson Medals were given out during the award's lifetime.&lt;ref name="winners"/&gt;

'''Ethnopoetics''' is a method of recording text versions of [[oral poetry]] or narrative performances (i.e. verbal lore) that uses poetic [[line (poetry)|lines]], [[verse (poetry)|verses]], and [[stanza]]s (instead of prose paragraphs) to capture the formal, poetic performance elements which would otherwise be lost in the written texts. The goal of any ethnopoetic text is to show how the techniques of unique oral performers enhance the aesthetic value of their performances within their specific cultural contexts. Major contributors to ethnopoetic theory include [[Jerome Rothenberg]], [[Dennis Tedlock]], and [[Dell Hymes]]. Ethnopoetics is considered  a subfield of [[ethnology]], [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], [[stylistics (field of study)|stylistics]], [[linguistics]], and [[Literary criticism|literature]] and translation studies.

==A need for ethnopoetics: Rothenberg==
Jerome Rothenberg  coined the term ethnopoetics in the 1960s. According to Catherine S. Quick, Rothenberg had recognized that “most translations of Native American oral traditions . . . failed to capture the power and beauty of the oral performances on the written page,” especially when “Western poetic styles” were imposed upon these written texts (1999, 96).&lt;ref name="Quick"&gt;Quick, Catherine. 1999. "Ethnopoetics." ''Folklore Forum'' 30(1/2): 95–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberg’s influence has increased public [[awareness]] of the rich narrative and poetic traditions of cultures all over the world.

==Ethnopoetic theory: Tedlock and Hymes==
The development of ethnopoetics as a separate subfield of study was largely pioneered from the middle of the 20th century by anthropologists and linguists such as Dennis Tedlock and Dell Hymes. Both Tedlock and Hymes used ethnopoetic analysis to do justice to the artistic richness of Native American verbal art, and while they have disagreed on some analytic details, they agree on the fundamental issues and purposes of ethnopoetics.

===Dennis Tedlock===
On the one hand, Dennis Tedlock argues not only that pauses in oral performances indicate where poetic line breaks should occur in the written texts, which he compares to musical scores,&lt;ref name="Quick"/&gt; but also that words on the page should be formatted to reflect the more subtle qualities of speech used in oral performances. Tedlock explain his perspective in this way,
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;An ethnopoetic score [or text] not only takes account of the words but silences, changes in loudness and tone of voice, the production of sound effects, and the use of gestures and props. . . . Ethnopoetics remains open to the creative side of performance, valuing features that may be rare or even unique to a particular artist or occasion.&lt;ref name="Tedlock"&gt;Tedlock, Dennis. Syllabus. “English 699: Ethnopoetics.” Colleges of Arts and Sciences. University at Buffalo. Accessed 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Tedlock argues that by visually representing oral performance features in the written texts, ethnopoetic methods more accurately convey the aesthetic qualities of the performance than uniformly formatted text in prose paragraphs ever could. Tedlock himself defines ethnopoetics as “a decentered poetics, an attempt to hear and read the poetries of distant others, outside the Western [poetic] tradition as we know it now."&lt;ref name="Tedlock"/&gt;

===Dell Hymes===
On the other hand, Dell Hymes believes that even previously dictated texts retain significant structural patterns of poetic repetition that “are the ‘reason why’” storytellers use pauses in their oral performances (1999, 97–98).&lt;ref name="Quick"/&gt; Hymes’s ethnopoetic theories focus on repetitions in the grammar and syntax of transcribed and translated texts that he suggest can still be analyzed and retranslated. For example, accordingly to folklorist [[Barre Toelken]], the poetic beauty and power of Native American texts like “The Sun's Myth” have been restored “because a dedicated anthropological folklorist and linguist, Dell Hymes, dedicated a good part of his life to resuscitating a dry, written text collected . . . by a long-dead anthropologist [i.e., Franz Boas] and stored away in a dusty volume” (2003, 122).&lt;ref name="Toelken"&gt;Toelken, Barre. 2003. The Anguish of Snails. Vol. 2, Folklife of the West, edited by [[Barre Toelken]] and William A. Wilson. Logan: Utah State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  When Hymes retranslated “The Sun’s Myth,” he recovered the poetic and stylistic devices that were used in the original recorded performance, but which had been lost in the myth’s earlier translation by [[Franz Boas]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hymes’ ethnopoetics revolves around a conception of narratives as primarily organized in terms of ''formal'' and ''aesthetic''—‘poetic’—patterns, not in terms of content or thematic patterns. Narrative is therefore to be seen as a form of action, of performance, and the meanings it generates are effects of performance. Narratives, seen from this perspective, are organized in lines and in groups of lines (verses, stanzas), and the organization of lines in narratives is a kind of implicit patterning that creates narrative effect. . . . Content, in other words, is an effect of the formal organization of a narrative: What there is to be told emerges out of how it is being told. (Blommaert 2007, 216)&lt;ref name="Blommaert"&gt;Blommaert, Jan. 2007. “Applied Ethnopoetics.” Narrative–State of the Art. Edited by Michael G. W. Bamberg. Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company. Benjamins Current Topics Series (Number: 595215). 215–224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, understanding the native language of oral performers is essential for accurate, ethnopoetic translation of their words into written texts. For example, folklorist Barre Toelken explains that Hymes’s “knowledge of the extant Chinookan languages” helped him to “notice stylistic devices that highlighted certain actions and themes and even performance styles that brought scenes into sharp focus” (2003, 122).&lt;ref name="Toelken"/&gt; In other words, without his knowledge of the native language of oral performers, Hymes could not have placed his ethnopoetic translation of “The Sun’s Myth” within its specific Native American cultural context.

==Ethnopoetics: aesthetic movement or academic discipline?==
Various other writers and poets can be said to have contributed to the field of ethnopoetics as an aesthetic movement. For example, Tristan Tzara created [[calligrams]] and [[William Bright]] worked with the Karuk tribe to preserve their native language. However, within the fields of [[linguistics]], [[folkloristics]], and [[anthropology]], ethnopoetics refers to a particular method of analyzing the linguistic features and syntactical structures of [[oral literature]] (such as poetry, myths, narratives, folk tales, ceremonial speeches, etc.) in ways that pay attention to poetic patterns within speech. Overall, then, ethnopoetic methods and theories strive to capture on the written page the unique aesthetic elements of individual cultures’ oral poetry and narrative performance traditions, or what folklorists would call their verbal lore.

'''''Fatal Frame''''', titled {{nihongo|'''''Zero'''''|零|〜zero〜}} in Japan and '''''Project Zero''''' in Europe, is a [[survival horror]] video game series created and primarily developed by [[Koei Tecmo]] (originally [[Tecmo]]), and currently co-owned by Koei Tecmo and [[Nintendo]]. Debuting in 2001 with the [[Fatal Frame (video game)|first entry in the series]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], the series consists of five main entries. The series is set in 1980s Japan, with each entry focusing on a location beset by hostile supernatural events. In each scenario, the characters involved in the present investigation use Camera Obscura, objects created by Dr. Kunihiko Asou that can capture and pacify spirits. The series draws on staple elements of [[Japanese horror]], and is noted for its frequent use of female protagonists.

The series was conceived by Makoto Shibata and Keisuke Kikuchi. After being introduced to the PlayStation 2 hardware and after the success of the ''[[Silent Hill]]'' series, the pair decided to develop a horror series inspired by Shibata's own spiritual experiences and popular Japanese horror films of the time. Their main goal was to make the most frightening game experience possible. Later installments have refined the gameplay mechanics while also adding more complex narrative elements.

The series has received critical acclaim, being ranked alongside other horror series including ''Resident Evil'' and ''Silent Hill'' series, while individual games have been ranked among the best survival horror games in existence. While the sales of individual games have never been high, the series as a whole has sold over one million copies worldwide as of April 2014. Multiple Japanese media adaptations have been made.

As of 2014, the series consists of five mainline video games, not counting remakes, re-releases and spin-offs.&lt;ref name= "4Ginterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4gamer.net/games/254/G025443/20140925135/|script-title=ja:「零 〜濡鴉ノ巫女〜」を生み出した任天堂＆コーエーテクモゲームスに，Wii Uによって実現した斬新な恐怖体験について聞いた|last=Inamoto|first=Tetsuya|publisher=4Gamer|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=12 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922040254/http://www.4gamer.net/games/254/G025443/20140925135/|archivedate=22 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only main ''Fatal Frame'' title yet to be released in the west is the fourth entry.

Each environment is filled with ghosts, with separate games having different attack behaviors for them.&lt;ref name="NWRfatal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps2/project_zero_3_the_tormented/news/project_zero_3_q_and_a.html|title=Project Zero 3 Q&amp;A|last=Orry|first=James|publisher=VideoGamer.com|date=6 February 2006|accessdate=21 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911012139/http://www.videogamer.com/ps2/project_zero_3_the_tormented/news/project_zero_3_q_and_a.html|archivedate=11 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While navigating these environments, the main character's only means of defense is the Camera Obscura, which can be used to damage ghosts, capturing them on film and pacifying them. When using the camera, the view switches from a third-person to a first-person perspective. The camera locks onto a ghost, with the amount of damage dealt depending on how much of a focus the Camera Obscura has on the ghost, but ghosts fade in and out of existence, making focusing more challenging. Shots of varying closeness and angles also affect how much damage the ghost takes. The most damaging is a "fatal frame", which hits a ghost weak spot. A ghost's captured spirit energy is converted into points, which can be used to buy items to upgrade the Camera Obscura and obtain more powerful film.&lt;ref name="IGNffReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/03/05/fatal-frame-2|title=Fatal Frame Review|last=Smith|first=David|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=5 March 2002|accessdate=21 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819033952/http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/03/05/fatal-frame-2|archivedate=19 August 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "NinImpressions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/09/first_impressions_taking_a_shot_at_fatal_frame_maiden_of_black_water|title=First Impressions: Taking A Shot At Fatal Frame: Maiden Of Black Water|last=McMahon|first=Conor|publisher=Nintendo Life|date=30 September 2015|accessdate=13 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002162636/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/09/first_impressions_taking_a_shot_at_fatal_frame_maiden_of_black_water|archivedate=2 October 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CubedReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubed3.com/review/1589/1/zero-tsukihami-no-kamen-nintendo-wii.html|title=Zero: Tsukihami no Kamen (Wii) Review|last=Lichi|first=Albert|publisher=Cubed3|date=30 September 2014|accessdate=14 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916031812/http://www.cubed3.com/review/1589/1/zero-tsukihami-no-kamen-nintendo-wii.html|archivedate=16 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to hostile ghosts, there are passive ghosts encountered in parts of the environment: if they are not caught on film at once, they vanish from the rest of the game. Ghosts captured on film are added to a list, which reveals a ghost's past.&lt;ref name="NWRfatal"/&gt; For the first three games, navigation is done using semi-fixed third-person view of environments, with characters moving at a slow pace through them. For ''Mask of the Lunar Eclipse'' and later entries, the camera perspective was altered to a third-person over-the-shoulder view and character movement was increased a little to speed up gameplay. The ability to either dodge or break free from a ghost's grip was added in ''Maiden of Black Water''.&lt;ref name= "4Ginterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WiiCreatorInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNffReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "NinImpressions"/&gt;

===Setting===
The ''Fatal Frame / Project Zero'' series is set in the 1980s, before mobile phones were commonly used in Japan. Aside from a few recurring characters, each game has a self-contained story focusing on a different supernatural threat. The main unifying factor is navigating through haunted locations struck by a supernatural catastrophe, with a recurring setting being abandoned Japanese mansions.&lt;ref name="WiiCreatorInterview"/&gt; Recurring characters are: Dr. Kunihiko Asou, an occultist who lived in the 1800s and created objects such as the Camera Obscura, &lt;ref name="NWRfatal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/32312/scary-nintendo-memories-fatal-frame|title=Scary Nintendo Memories - Fatal Frame|last=Brown|first=Andrew|publisher=Nintendo World Report|date=3 November 2012|accessdate=21 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021080834/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/32312/scary-nintendo-memories-fatal-frame|archivedate=21 October 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Miku Hinasaki, the protagonist of ''Fatal Frame'' and ''The Tormented'', who also appears in ''Maiden of Black Water'' as one of the main characters' missing mother. A second recurring feature is the exclusive or frequent use of female characters in the leading role. This was explained as being due to the overall tone of the series: since traditional violence was not used, it was better to use a female character to convey this. It was also felt that women were more spiritually aware than men.&lt;ref name="GSpInterview"/&gt; Another recurring concept is a pseudo-physical location bridging the physical and spiritual worlds, inspired by a [[tanka]] written by Japanese poet Taeko Kuzuhara: these were represented by the Hellish Abyss in ''Crimson Butterfly'' and the lake in ''Maiden of Black Water''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |script-title=ja:零〜濡鴉ノ巫女〜コンプリートガイド|publisher=[[Koei]] |isbn=978-4775809433 |date=29 November 2014|pages=170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first chronological entry in the series, ''Mask of the Lunar Eclipse'', takes place in 1980. The story revolves around three girls who travel back to the fictional Rougetsu Island to recover memories of being kidnapped while they lived there ten years before. On the island, they must investigate the secrets behind a local ritual dance and an ancient mask related to the ritual.&lt;ref name="WiiCreatorInterview"/&gt; Then there's ''Fatal Frame'' and ''Crimson Butterfly'', which is set two years after the first game. ''The Tormented'' is set some months after the second game's events.&lt;ref name="GSpInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/fatal-frame-3/644109p1.html|title=Fatal Frame III: The Tormented Interview|last=Nutt|first=Christian|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=22 August 2005|accessdate=21 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013053036/http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/fatal-frame-3/644109p1.html|archivedate=13 October 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maiden of Black Water'' is set at an unspecified date after the third game. It takes place around the fictional Mount Hikami, a site infamous for suicides and rituals associated with local bodies of water. The main protagonists are each drawn to the mountain intent on rescuing someone, confronting hostile ghosts along the way.&lt;ref name="PZreveal"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "FFBook5"&gt;{{cite book |script-title=ja:零〜濡鴉ノ巫女〜コンプリートガイド|publisher=[[Koei]] |isbn=978-4775809433 |date=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
The concept for ''Fatal Frame / Project Zero'' first occurred by Makoto Shibata. The idea occurred after the development of ''[[Tecmo's Deception: Invitation to Darkness]]''. Inspired by his own experiences of supernatural events, and heartened by the success of the ''[[Silent Hill]]'' series, Shibata and Keisuke Kikuchi set to work on creating the basics for the game. Shibata was in charge of the majority of game and scenario development, while Kikuchi was in charge of general oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |script-title=ja:零〜刺青ノ聲〜公式完全攻略本 導魂之書publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |isbn=978-4757724983 |date=October 2005}} [http://fftranslations.atspace.co.uk/ff3interviewgb.html Translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105032057/http://fftranslations.atspace.co.uk/ff3interviewgb.html |date=2015-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When creating the atmosphere, the team watched both high and low-budget Japanese horror films, and war films. One of their goals was to make the game as scary as possible.&lt;ref name="WiiCreatorInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "ZeroStaffInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_id1.htm|script-title=ja:スタッフインタビュー『零が生まれた理由』|publisher=Zero Japanese Website|date=2002|accessdate=21 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619145008/http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_id1.htm|archivedate=19 June 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/05/01/fatal-frame-behind-the-lens-of-the-ps2-horror-classic/|title=Fatal Frame: Behind the Lens of the PS2 Horror Classic|last=Shibata|first=Makoto|publisher=[[PlayStation Blog]]|date=1 May 2013|accessdate=21 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003024408/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/05/01/fatal-frame-behind-the-lens-of-the-ps2-horror-classic/|archivedate=3 October 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Camera Obscura was not in the initial discussions between Shibata and Kikuchi, with the original idea being that ghosts would be avoided and repelled by light. Ultimately, they decided to have a type of offensive power, which resulted in the Camera's creation. Kikuchi was initially opposed to the idea, but saw that it fitted very well into the game's context as development progressed.&lt;ref name="WiiCreatorInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "ZeroStaffInterview"/&gt; The first game was marketed in the west as being based on a true story, and while this was not accurate, the story of ''Fatal Frame'' was inspired by both real locations noted for apparent haunting and local ghost-related folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2002/10/23/finding-fatal-frame|title=Finding Fatal Frame|last=Boulding|first=Aaron|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=23 October 2002|accessdate=21 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021082339/http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/23/finding-fatal-frame|archivedate=21 October 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Crimson Butterfly'', the team toned down the frightening aspects so players would be willing to complete a playthrough, alongside creating a stronger story. The story was inspired by a dream Shibata had, with the interpretive nature of the game's events being inspired by his feelings about the dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/05/02/fatal-frame-2-hits-psn-tuesday-series-director-speaks/|title=Fatal Frame 2 Hits PSN Tuesday, Series Director Speaks|last=Shibata|first=Makoto|publisher=[[PlayStation Blog]]|date=2 May 2013|accessdate=21 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930130419/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/05/02/fatal-frame-2-hits-psn-tuesday-series-director-speaks/|archivedate=30 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''The Tormented'', they decided to focus on horror elements emerging out of everyday life, focusing on the effects of dreams upon reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/10/01/fatal-frame-iii-the-tormented-reemerges-today-on-psn/|title=Fatal Frame III: The Tormented Reemerges Today on PSN|last=Shibata|first=Makoto|publisher=[[PlayStation Blog]]|date=1 October 2013|accessdate=21 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912110754/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/10/01/fatal-frame-iii-the-tormented-reemerges-today-on-psn/|archivedate=12 September 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mask of the Lunar Eclipse'' was co-produced by Koei Tecmo, Nintendo and [[Grasshopper Manufacture]], with Grasshopper Manufacture's [[Goichi Suda]] acting as a co-director with Shibata.&lt;ref name="WiiCreatorInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2008/01/30/fatal-frame-4-preview|title=Fatal Frame IV Preview|author=Bozon|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=30 January 2008|accessdate=14 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151014221132/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/30/fatal-frame-4-preview|archivedate=14 October 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gameplay was constructed around the Wii hardware, with the main concept being for players to feel the fear physically. The entire concept occurred by Kikuchi when he saw the specifications for the Wii.&lt;ref name="WiiCreatorInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "FFBook5"/&gt; ''Maiden of Black Water'' originated when Kikuchi saw the Wii U hardware, and was co-produced by Koei Tecmo and Nintendo. As they wanted to bring more people into the series, they included a stronger narrative and new gameplay elements to make the experience easier for newcomers.&lt;ref name= "FFBook5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=25 September 2014|script-title=ja:|journal=[[Famitsu Weekly]]|issue=1347|pages=92–93| publisher=[[Enterbrain]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''Crimson Butterfly'', theme songs have been created for each title, primarily performed by Japanese singer [[Tsuki Amano]]. The development team wanted an image song for ''Crimson Butterfly'', and Shibata found the then-newly debuted Amano in the Japanese independent community. Amano created the song using documents on the game's story, themes and setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero2/kaihatu1.htm|script-title=ja:『零〜紅い蝶〜』開発秘話 - その一　イメージソング「蝶」について...|publisher=Zero: Crimson Butterfly Official Website|date=2003|accessdate=21 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530094335/http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero2/kaihatu1.htm|archivedate=30 May 2015|deadurl=no}} [http://fftranslations.atspace.co.uk/chou.html Translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424213324/http://fftranslations.atspace.co.uk/chou.html |date=2012-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amano returned multiple times to create theme songs for ''The Tormented'', ''Mask of the Lunar Eclipse'', and a new theme song for the Wii remake of ''Crimson Butterfly''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201206/21016584.html|script-title=ja:『零 〜眞紅の蝶〜』天野月×柴田誠スペシャル対談！ 『蝶』から『くれなゐ』へ|publisher=''[[Famitsu]]''|language=Japanese|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=14 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928123932/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201206/21016584.html|archivedate=28 September 2015|deadurl=no}} [http://fftranslations.atspace.co.uk/choutokurenai.html Translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525062651/http://fftranslations.atspace.co.uk/choutokurenai.html |date=2013-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She again returned for ''Maiden of Black Water'', and a second new singer AnJu contributed a second theme song to the title.&lt;ref name= "4Ginterview"/&gt;

In Japan, each title in the ''Fatal Frame / Project Zero'' series has seen modest success: the first game's lifetime sales are the lowest in the series, while ''Mask of the Lunar Eclipse'' currently stands as the best-selling title in the series to date.&lt;ref name= "CubedRelease"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nintendoeverything.com/image-japanese-fatal-frame-sales-comparison/|title=Image: Japanese Fatal Frame sales comparison|last=Richards|first=Brian|publisher=Nintendo Everything|date=1 October 2014|accessdate=13 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101192853/http://nintendoeverything.com/image-japanese-fatal-frame-sales-comparison|archivedate=1 January 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its debut in 2001, the ''Fatal Frame'' series has sold 1.3 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinematoday.jp/page/N0062343|script-title=ja:ホラーゲーム「零」が実写映画化！「Seventeen」美少女モデル2人を大抜てき！|publisher=Japan Cinema Today|date=22 April 2014|accessdate=21 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524105114/http://www.cinematoday.jp/page/N0062343|archivedate=24 May 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple video game journalists have singled out the series. [[IGN]]'s Clara Barraza, in an article on the evolution of the survival horror genre, said that the first game "broke away from the use of weapons like guns and planks of wood to switch it up and try something completely different", praising the use of the Camera Obscura in evoking a sense of fear and calling the game "[a] unique spin on the genre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2008/09/01/the-evolution-of-the-survival-horror-genre|title=The Evolution of the Survival Horror Genre|last=Barraza|first=Clara|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=1 September 2008|accessdate=21 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023034246/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/09/01/the-evolution-of-the-survival-horror-genre|archivedate=23 October 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a different article for IGN on the history of survival horror, editor Travis Fahs stated that the series gave a much-needed boost to the genre during a period of decline in the early 2000s, highlighting the Japanese horror aesthetic as a selling point that attracted players in tandem with the popularity of ''The Ring''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/10/30/ign-presents-the-history-of-survival-horror|title=IGN Presents The History of Survival Horror|last=Fahs|first=Travis|publisher=[[IGN]]|page=6|date=30 October 2009|accessdate=21 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021121315/http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/30/ign-presents-the-history-of-survival-horror|archivedate=21 October 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra) Palais du Cinema.jpg|thumb|The [[Venice Film Festival]] is the oldest film festival in the world and one of the most prestigious and publicized]]
A '''film festival''' is an organized, extended presentation of [[film]]s in one or more [[movie theater|cinema]]s or screening venues, usually in a single city or region. Increasingly, film festivals show some films outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openaircinemas.wordpress.com|title=Open air cinemas|work=Open air cinemas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films may be of recent date and, depending upon the festival's focus, can include international and domestic releases. Some festivals focus on a specific film-maker or genre (e.g., [[film noir]]) or subject matter (e.g., horror film festivals). A number of film festivals specialise in [[short film]]s of a defined maximum length. Film festivals are typically annual events. Some film historians, including Jerry Beck,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/animated-movie-guide-1/|title=Animated Movie Guide 1 - Cartoon Research|work=cartoonresearch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; do not consider film festivals official releases of film.

The most prestigious film festivals in the world are generally considered to be [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], and [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These festivals are sometimes called the "Big Three."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[Toronto International Film Festival]] is North America's most popular festival in terms of attendance; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' wrote it had "grown from its place as the most influential fall film festival to the most influential film festival, period."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Venice Film Festival is the oldest film festival in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/style/article/why-venice-is-worlds-most-glamorous-film-festival/index.html|title=Why Venice film festival is the most glamorous|date=2017-09-05|work=CNN Style|access-date=2018-01-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Venice Film Festival]] in [[Italy]] began in 1932, and is the oldest film festival still running. [[Raindance Film Festival]] is the UK's largest celebration of independent film-making, and takes place in London in October.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/advertising/beales-best-in-show-raindance-film-festival-4creative-922378.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Beale's best in show: Raindance film festival (4Creative) | date=September 8, 2008 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mainland Europe]]'s biggest independent film festival is [[ÉCU The European Independent Film Festival]], that started in 2006 and takes place every spring in Paris, France.&lt;ref name="faceoffilm.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://faceoffilm.com/ecu-film-festival-taking-lead-indie-films-europe/ | work=Face Of Film | location=Paris | title=ÉCU Film Festival – Taking the lead on indie films in Europe | date=June 10, 2017 | accessdate=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] is the longest running festival in [[Great Britain]].

Australia's first and longest running film festival is the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] (1952), followed by the [[Sydney Film Festival]] (1954).

North America's first and longest running short film festival is the [[Yorkton Film Festival]], established in 1947.&lt;ref name="Yorkton1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldensheafawards.com/files/File/history/5_internationalfestival.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113140333/http://www.goldensheafawards.com/files/File/history/5_internationalfestival.pdf |archivedate=November 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yorkton2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldensheafawards.com/files/File/history/6_firstinternational.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203025132/http://www.goldensheafawards.com/files/File/history/6_firstinternational.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first film festival in the United States was the [[Columbus International Film &amp; Video Festival]], also known as [[The Chris Awards]], held in 1953. According to the [[Film Arts Foundation]] in San Francisco, "''The Chris Awards'' (is) one of the most prestigious documentary, educational, business and informational competitions in the U.S; (it is) the oldest of its kind in North America and celebrating its 54th year." It was followed four years later by the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], held in March 1957, which emphasized feature-length dramatic films. The festival played a major role in introducing foreign films to American audiences. Films in the first year included [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Throne of Blood]]'' and [[Satyajit Ray]]'s ''[[Pather Panchali (film)|Pather Panchali]]''.

Today, thousands of film festivals take place around the world—from high-profile festivals such as [[Sundance Film Festival]] and [[Slamdance Film Festival]] ([[Park City, Utah]]), to horror festivals such as Terror Film Festival ([[Philadelphia]]), and the Park City Film Music Festival, the first U.S. film festival dedicated to honoring music in film.

Film Funding competitions such as Writers and Filmmakers were introduced when the cost of production could be lowered significantly and internet technology allowed for the collaboration of film production.

== Festival administration ==

=== Business model ===
Although there are notable for-profit festivals such as [[South by Southwest|SXSW]], most festivals operate on a nonprofit membership-based model, with a combination of ticket sales, membership fees, and corporate sponsorship constituting the majority of revenue. Unlike other arts nonprofits (performing arts, museums, etc.), film festivals typically receive few donations from the general public and are occasionally organized as nonprofit business associations instead of public charities. Film industry members often have significant curatorial input, and corporate sponsors are given opportunities to promote their brand to festival audiences in exchange for cash contributions. Private parties, often to raise investments for film projects, constitute significant "fringe" events. Larger festivals maintain year-round staffs often engaging in community and charitable projects outside festival season.

=== Entry fee ===
While entries from established filmmakers are usually considered pluses by the organizers, most festivals require new or relatively unknown filmmakers to pay an entry fee to have their works considered for screening. This is especially so in larger film festivals, such as the [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[Toronto International Film Festival]], [[Sundance Film Festival]], [[South by Southwest]], [[Montreal World Film Festival]], and even smaller "boutique" festivals such as the [[Miami International Film Festival]], [[British Urban Film Festival]] in London and [[Mumbai Women's International Film Festival]] in India.

On the other hand, some festivals—usually those accepting fewer films, and perhaps not attracting as many "big names" in their audiences as do [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] and [[Telluride Film Festival|Telluride]]—require no entry fee. [[Rotterdam Film Festival]], [[Mumbai]] Film Festival, and many smaller film festivals in the United States (the [[Stony Brook Film Festival]] on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], the [[Northwest Filmmakers' Festival]], and the Sicilian Film Festival in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]), are examples.
 
The [[Portland International Film Festival]] charges an entry fee, but waives it for filmmakers from the [[Northwestern United States]], and some others with regional focuses have similar approaches.

Several film festival submission portal websites exist to streamline filmmakers' entries into multiple festivals. They provide databases of festival calls for entry and offer filmmakers a convenient "describe once, submit many" service.

=== Screening out of competition ===
The core tradition of film festivals is competition, that is, the consideration of films with the intention of judging which are most deserving of various forms of recognition. In contrast to those films, some festivals may screen (i.e., [[projector|project]] onto a [[Projection screen|movie screen]] before an audience) some films without treating them as part of the competition; the films are said to be "screened out..." (or "outside...") "of competition".

A '''gable hood''', '''English hood''' or '''gable headdress''' is an [[England|English]] woman's [[hat|headdress]] of {{circa|1500–1550}}, so-called because its pointed shape resembles the [[gable]] of a house. The contemporary [[French hood]] was rounded in outline and unlike the gable hood, less conservative, displaying the front part of the hair.

Originally a simple pointed hood with decorated side panels called ''[[lappet]]s'' and a veil at the back, over time the gable hood became a complex construction stiffened with [[buckram]], with a box-shaped back and two tube-shaped hanging veils at 90-degree angles; the hanging veils and lappets could be pinned up in a variety of ways to make complex headdresses.

'''"Gitarzan"''' is a [[novelty song]] released by [[Ray Stevens]] in 1969 about a character who lives in a jungle and forms a musical band with his female partner, [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]], and their [[pet monkey]]. The song features [[Tarzan]]'s jungle calls, scat singing, and a funky [[boogie-woogie]], as well as a quote from the song "[[Swinging on a Star]]", with the line "Carrying noonbeams home in a jar" sung with the wrong notes. The song reached #8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in April 1969, and #10 in Canada in May 1969. The music and lyrics were written by Stevens with a title supplied by [[Bill Justis]]. Justis is officially credited as Bill Everette.

==Cover versions==
A cover version was recorded by [[country music]] [[parodist]] [[Cledus T. Judd]] on his tribute album ''[[Boogity, Boogity - A Tribute to the Comedic Genius of Ray Stevens]]'' in 2007. Judd's cover features [[Keith Urban]] and [[Heidi Newfield]] (former lead singer of [[Trick Pony]]). An earlier cover appeared on [[Ralph's World]]'s ''Green Gorilla, Monster and Me!'' (a children's music album) in 2006.

'''''Godfrey Morgan: A Californian Mystery''''' ({{lang-fr|L'École des Robinsons}}, literally ''The School for Robinsons''), also published as '''''School for Crusoes''''', is an 1882 [[adventure novel]] by French writer [[Jules Verne]].&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Andrew (2001-11-27). [http://www.julesverne.ca/vernebooks/jvbkschool.html ''École des Robinsons (L') - 1882'']. Retrieved on 2009-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel tells of a wealthy young man, '''Godfrey Morgan''' who, with his deportment instructor, [[Professor T. Artelett]], embark from [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]] on a round-the-world ocean voyage. They are [[Castaway|cast away]] on an uninhabited Pacific island where they must endure a series of adversities. Later they encounter an [[African slave]], Carefinotu, brought to the island by [[cannibals]].  In the end, the trio manage to work together and survive on the island.

The novel is a [[robinsonade]]—a play on [[Daniel Defoe]]'s [[1719 in literature|1719]] novel ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''.

==Plot summary==
The narrative begins with the auction by the [[Federal government of the United States|US Government]] of fictional Spencer Island, located 460 miles off the California coast ({{coord|32|15|N|145|18|W}}).  The island is uninhabited and there are only two bidders, William W. Kolderup, a very wealthy San Franciscan, and his arch-rival J. R. Taskinar, a resident of [[Stockton, California]].  Kolderup wins the auction, buying Spencer Island for four million dollars.  J. R. Taskinar mutters, "I will be avenged!" before retiring to his hotel.

Godfrey, an idle twenty-two-year-old, lives with Kolderup, his uncle, and Kolderup's adopted goddaughter, Phina, whom Godfrey has grown to love. Prior to marrying Phina, Godfrey asks to undertake a world tour. Acceding to his desire, his uncle sends Godfrey on a sea voyage around the world on board one of his [[steamship]]s, the ''Dream'', commanded by Captain Turcott.  Godfrey is accompanied by his mentor, teacher, and dance instructor, Professor T. Artelett aka "Tartlet".

After some time at sea, Godfrey is awakened one foggy night and told to abandon ship as the ''Dream'' is [[Shipwreck (accident)#Causes|founder]]ing.  After jumping into the sea, Godfrey is washed ashore on a deserted island, where he soon finds Tartlet has also been [[maroon]]ed. Godfrey, with scant help from Tartlet, will have to learn to survive, to organize his life, face hostile intruders, and overcome other [[obstacles]]. Eventually, they are also joined by Carefinotu, whom Godfrey rescues from [[Polynesians]] visiting the island. By the end of the story the formerly jaded young man has discovered the value of independent effort, and he gains poise and courage.  The marooned group are rescued and returned to San Francisco, where Godfrey is reunited with [[Phina]]. They agree to marry before continuing the world tour, this time together.

==Theme==
Although the setting is different, the [[robinsonade]] plot is a variation on the theme of rational self-sufficiency that Verne developed earlier in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1874). At the time of publication, it was common for a young man of wealth to undertake travel as an educational [[rite of passage]], for example the California heir [[Leland Stanford, Jr.]] who took two European [[Grand Tour]]s, one in 1880-81, and died on the second in 1884.  The original French version of Verne's novel was published in 1882, after Stanford's first tour.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Theresa, [http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2003/julaug/features/junior.html "About a Boy,"] ''Stanford'', July–August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
The novel was adapted for a 1981 USA/Spain co-production by director [[Juan Piquer Simón]], titled '''''Jules Verne's Mystery on Monster Island''''' ({{lang-es|Misterio en Isla de los Monstruos}}), and starring [[Peter Cushing]] and [[Terence Stamp]], with [[David Hatton]], [[Ian Sera]], [[Paul Naschy]], [[Blanca Estrada]], [[Ana Obregón]] and [[Frank Braña]] in supporting roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Korean traditional shoes-01.jpg|thumb|alt=A pair of low, red women's shoes and a pair of black boots on a step|''Hye'' (foreground) and ''hwa'' (background)]]
'''''Hwahyejang ''''' ({{korean|hangul=화혜장}}) are craftsmen who construct traditional [[Korea]]n footwear. The shoes are classified into ''hwa'' (shoes that go over the ankle) and ''hye'' (shoes that do not cover the ankle), hence the compound word "''hwahyejang''".&lt;ref name=CHAK&gt;{{cite web|title=Hwahyejang|url=http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/search_plaza_new/EMapResultView.jsp?VdkVgwKey=17,01160000,11&amp;strGuCode=28&amp;strSidoCode=11|work=Heritage Information|publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration of Korea|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the two distinct types of shoe were made by separate specialist craftsmen, the ''hyejang'' and the ''hwajang''.&lt;ref name=koreana&gt;{{cite web|last=Park|first=Hyun Sook|title=Shoemaker Hwang Hae-bong|url=http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=533&amp;lang=en&amp;page_type=list|work=Koreana|publisher=Korea Foundation|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hwang Hae-bong==
The only surviving traditional ''hwahyejang'' in Korea today is Hwang Hae-bong, who operates a small workshop in [[Seoul]]. His family have been making shoes for five generations. Hwang learned the trade from his grandfather and is training his second son Hwang Deok-jin to continue in the profession. In 2004, at the age of sixty, Hwang was recognised by Korea's Cultural Heritage Association as an intangible cultural asset, following in the footsteps of his grandfather Hwang Han-gap, who was made a cultural asset in 1971.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;&lt;ref name=joongang2&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Ho-jeong|title=There's no business like shoe business|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2882884|work=Korea Joongang Daily|publisher=Joongang Ilbo|accessdate=8 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709201951/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2882884|archivedate=9 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=joongang&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Yeong-hee |title=Traditional shoes wear thin, but last hwahyejang carries on |url=http://en.korea.com/blog/handb/beauty-fashion/traditional-shoes-wear-thin-but-last-hwahyejang-carries-on/ |work=Korea Joongang Daily |publisher=JoongAng Ilbo |accessdate=8 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623072950/http://en.korea.com/blog/handb/beauty-fashion/traditional-shoes-wear-thin-but-last-hwahyejang-carries-on/ |archivedate=23 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional shoes represent Korean beauty, elegance |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2011/04/135_85554.html |publisher=Korea Times |accessdate=10 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810082958/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2011/04/135_85554.html |archivedate=10 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The basic form of the Korean shoe was developed during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms era]], although earlier forms date back to prehistoric times.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt; During the early [[Joseon|Joseon period]] as many as 30 professional shoemakers were employed at court. The shoemaking caste, however, was considered ''[[cheonmin]]'', the lowest possible caste. At this time, shoes were an important indicator of a person's profession or social status, with designs, colours and styles varying depending on social caste or occupation.&lt;ref name=arirang&gt;{{cite web|title=Hwahye; Korean Shoes|url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/Tv2/ALegacy_Archive.asp?PROG_CODE=tvcr0301&amp;view_cont_seq=24&amp;code=St1&amp;sys_lang=Eng|work=Ancestral Legacies|publisher=Arirang|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the [[Gabo Reform]] of 1894, traditional leather shoes became less popular, and in the twentieth century were largely superseded by rubber ''[[gomusin]]''.

Since the release of [[Kim Yong-ik]]'s short story ''Wedding Shoes'' and the film ''[[Flower Shoes|Ggotsin]]'' ("flower shoes") the term ''ggotsin'' has become a popular alternative name for classical Korean shoes.&lt;ref name="joongang2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joongang"/&gt; ''Hwahye'' are still worn for special occasions such as royal weddings, and for days of national mourning.&lt;ref name=arirang/&gt; In 2004 the art of shoemaking was recognised as an [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea|Important Intangible Cultural Property of Korea]].&lt;ref name=CHAK/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title=Hwahyejang |url=http://www.ichcap.org/en/archives/unescoView2.jsp?ich_name=ICH_LIST3_ENG&amp;idx=&amp;listLIDX=126&amp;searchtext= |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130704023441/http://www.ichcap.org/en/archives/unescoView2.jsp?ich_name=ICH_LIST3_ENG&amp;idx=&amp;listLIDX=126&amp;searchtext= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 July 2013 |work=ICH Archives |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=8 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
It can take as much as a week to craft a single pair of shoes.&lt;ref name=joongang/&gt; The shoes are typically made from leather obtained from cows, pigs or sheep, although historically horsehide and deerskin were also used. Whereas Western shoes are shaped differently for left and right feet, Korean shoes are identical for both feet; the softness of the leather gradually conforms to the shape of the owner's foot. Some types have ribbons or laces that are knotted around the ankle to keep the shoe in place. Many are decorated with floral designs, and are sometimes covered with an ornamental silk upper.&lt;ref name=CHAK/&gt;&lt;ref name=joongang2/&gt;

The process of creating a traditional shoe involves up to 72 individual processes, the most important of which is the stitching. This is performed using a needle made from a boar bristle, rather than a manufactured steel needle, due to the need for flexibility.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;

}}'''Jiggs and Maggie''' were the major characters in a series of films made by the American studio [[Monogram Pictures]] between 1946 and 1950. Jiggs and Maggie are [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants to the [[United States]], who constantly argue. The characters were created by the cartoonist [[George McManus]] in his long-running strip ''[[Bringing Up Father]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Drew p.170&lt;/ref&gt; McManus appears in four of the films, playing himself.

The characters had first appeared on screen in the 1928 [[MGM]] film ''[[Bringing Up Father (1928 film)|Bringing Up Father]]''. In 1946 Monogram made a fresh version starring actors [[Joe Yule]] and [[Renie Riano]]. Due to the popularity of the film, a series of four spin-offs were made. Monogram was a low-budget studio that specializes in making comedy, crime and western series.

The final film in the series, ''[[Jiggs and Maggie Out West]]'', was released a little less than a month after Yule suffered a fatal heart attack.

'''Knowledge sharing''' is an activity through which [[knowledge]] (namely, information, skills, or expertise) is exchanged among people, friends, families, communities (for example, Wikipedia), or organizations.&lt;ref name=2KMF&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bukowitz|last2=Williams|first1=Wendi R.|first2=Ruth L.|title=The Knowledge Management Fieldbook|year=1999|publisher=FT Press|isbn=978-0273638827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=5OKM&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serban|last2=Luan|first1=Andreea M.|first2=Jing (2002)|title=An Overview of Knowledge Management|url=http://www.uky.edu/~gmswan3/575/Serban_and_Luan_2002.pdf|publisher=University of Kentucky|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasmath|first=Reza|last2=Hsu|first2=Jennifer Y. J.|date=2016|title=Communities of Practice and the NGO Sector in China|ssrn=2612686|journal=|location=|publisher=International Society for Third Sector Research Conference (Stockholm, Sweden), June 28-July 1|volume=|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations have recognized that knowledge constitutes a valuable [[intangible asset]] for creating and sustaining competitive advantages.&lt;ref name=6AMJ /&gt; Knowledge sharing activities are generally supported by [[knowledge management system]]s.&lt;ref name="15BF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/bloomfire|title=Bloomfire|work=CrunchBase|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, technology constitutes only one of the many factors that affect the sharing of knowledge in organizations, such as [[organizational culture]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and [[incentives]].&lt;ref name="Cabrera"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cabrera|first=A.|author2=Cabrera, E. F.|year=2002|title=Knowledge-sharing Dilemmas|journal=Organization Studies|volume=23|issue=5|pages=687–710|doi=10.1177/0170840602235001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sharing of knowledge constitutes a major challenge in the field of [[knowledge management]] because some employees tend to resist sharing their knowledge with the rest of the organization.&lt;ref name="Patriota"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ciborra|first=C.U.|author2=Patriota, G.|year=1998|title=Groupware and teamwork in R&amp;D: limits to learning and innovation|journal=R&amp;D Management|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the digital world, websites and applications enable knowledge or talent sharing between individuals and/or within teams. The individuals can easily reach the people who want to learn, share their talent and get rewarded.

==Flow or transfer==
Although knowledge is commonly treated as an object, [[Dave Snowden]] has argued it is more appropriate to teach it as both a flow and a thing.&lt;ref name="Snowden"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Complex acts of knowing: paradox and descriptive self-awareness| last = Snowden | first = D. | year = 2002| journal = Journal of Knowledge Management | pages = 100–111 | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1108/13673270210424639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge as a flow can be related to the concept of tacit knowledge,&lt;ref name="Polanyi"&gt;{{cite book | title = Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy | last = Polanyi | first = M. | year = 2003 | origyear = 1958 | publisher = CRC Press | isbn = 0-203-44215-6 | pages = 428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nonaka"&gt;{{cite journal | title = A dynamic theory of organizational knowledge creation | last = Nonaka | first = I. | year = 1994 | journal = Organization Science | pages = 14–37 | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | doi = 10.1287/orsc.5.1.14| jstor = 2635068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Tacit Knowledge and Knowledge Conversion: Controversy and Advancement in Organizational Knowledge Creation Theory | last = Nonaka | first = I. | year = 2009 | journal = Organization Science | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | url = http://zonecours.hec.ca/documents/H2010-1-2241390.S2-TacitKnowledgeandKnowledgeConversion-ControversyandAdvancementinOrganizationalKnowledgeCreation.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101122050857/http://zonecours.hec.ca/documents/H2010-1-2241390.S2-TacitKnowledgeandKnowledgeConversion-ControversyandAdvancementinOrganizationalKnowledgeCreation.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2010-11-22 | pages = 635–652 | doi = 10.1287/orsc.1080.0412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the difficulty of sharing knowledge is in transferring knowledge from one entity to another,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Knowledge Transfer: A Basis for Competitive Advantage in Firms | year = 2000 | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | pages = 150–169 | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | doi = 10.1006/obhd.2000.2893 | last1 = Argote	| first1 =  L. | last2 =  Ingram | first2 =  P. | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fan1998&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The Transfer of Western Management to China: Context, Content and Constraints | year = 1998 | author = Fan, Y. | journal = Management Learning | pages = 201–221 | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1177/1350507698292005 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may prove profitable for organizations to acknowledge the difficulties of [[knowledge transfer]], adopting new knowledge management strategies accordingly.&lt;ref name="Snowden" /&gt;

==Explicit knowledge==

[[Explicit knowledge]] sharing occurs when explicit knowledge is made available to be shared between entities. Explicit knowledge sharing can happen successfully when the following criteria are met:
* Articulation: the knowledge provider can describe the information.&lt;ref name=2KMF /&gt; 
* Awareness: the recipient must be aware that knowledge is available.&lt;ref name=2KMF /&gt;
* Access: the knowledge recipient can access the knowledge provider.&lt;ref name=2KMF /&gt;
* Guidance: the body of knowledge must be defined and differentiated into different topics or domains so as to avoid information overload, and to provide easy access to appropriate material. Knowledge managers are often considered key figures in the creation of an effective knowledge sharing system.&lt;ref name=2KMF /&gt;&lt;ref name=3HBS&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prusak|first1=Lawrence|last2=Davenport|first2=Thomas H.|title=Working Knowledge: How Organizations Manage What They Know, 2nd Edition|year=2000|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=1-57851-301-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Completeness: the [[holistic]] approach to knowledge sharing in the form of both centrally managed and self-published knowledge.

==Tacit knowledge==

[[Tacit knowledge]] sharing occurs through different types of socialization. Although tacit knowledge is difficult to identify and codify, relevant factors that influence tacit knowledge sharing include:
* Informal networks such as daily interactions between people within a defined environment (work, school, home, etc.). These networks span [[hierarchies]] and functions.&lt;ref name=3HBS /&gt;
* The provision of space where people can engage in unstructured or unmonitored discussions, thereby fostering informal networks.&lt;ref name=3HBS /&gt;
* Unstructured, less-structured or experimental work practices that encourage [[creative problem solving]], and the development of [[social network]]s.&lt;ref name=3HBS /&gt;

==Embedded knowledge==

Embedded knowledge sharing occurs when knowledge is shared through clearly delineated products, processes, routines, etc. This knowledge can be shared in different ways, such as:
* [[Scenario planning]] and [[debriefing]]: providing a structured space to create possible scenarios, followed by a discussion of what happened, and how it could have been different.&lt;ref name=4UKY&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serban|last2=Luan|first1=Andreea M.|first2=Jing (2002)|title=Corporate Strategy Model: Scenario Planning|url=http://www.uky.edu/~gmswan3/575/Serban_and_Luan_2002.pdf|publisher=University of Kentucky|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Management training.
* Knowledge transfer: deliberately integrating systems, processes, routines, etc., to combine and share relevant knowledge.

==Importance to organizations==
Knowledge constitutes a valuable, intangible asset for creating and sustaining competitive advantages within organizations.&lt;ref name=6AMJ&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=D.|author2=Shamsie, J. |title=The resource-based view of the firm in two environments: The Hollywood film studios from 1936 to 1965|journal=Academy of Management Journal|year=1996|volume=39|issue=5|pages=519–543|doi=10.2307/256654|jstor = 256654}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors affect knowledge sharing in organizations, such as organizational culture, trust, incentives, and technology.&lt;ref name=7OS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cabrera|first=A.|author2=Cabrera, C. |title=Knowledge-sharing Dilemmas|journal=Organization Studies|year=2002|volume=23|issue=5|pages=687–710|doi=10.1177/0170840602235001}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge sharing activities are commonly supported by [[knowledge management]] systems, a form of [[information technology]] (IT) that facilitates and organizes information within a company or organization.&lt;ref name=13KMM&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gurteen|first=David|title=Creating a knowledge sharing culture|journal=Knowledge Management Magazine|date=February 1999|volume=2|issue=5|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Knowledge sharing can sometimes constitute a major challenge in the field of knowledge management.&lt;ref name=Nonaka /&gt; The difficulty of knowledge sharing resides in the transference of knowledge from one entity to another.&lt;ref name=Fan1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=11AI&gt;{{cite journal|last=Argote|first=L.|author2=Ingram, P. |title=Knowledge Transfer: A Basis for Competitive Advantage in Firms|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|year=2000|volume=82|issue=1|pages=150–169|doi=10.1006/obhd.2000.2893}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some employees tend to resist sharing their knowledge&lt;ref name=Nonaka /&gt; because of the notion that knowledge is property; ownership, therefore, becomes very important.&lt;ref name=10Dal&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalkir|first=K.|title=Knowledge Management In Theory And Practice|year=2005|publisher=Jordan Hill|location=Oxford: Elsevier Inc|pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to counteract this, individuals must be reassured that they will receive some type of incentive for what they create.&lt;ref name=10Dal /&gt; However, Dalkir (2005) demonstrated that individuals are most commonly rewarded for what they know, not what they share.&lt;ref name=10Dal /&gt; Negative consequences, such as isolation and resistance to ideas, occur when knowledge sharing is impeded.&lt;ref name=13KMM /&gt; To promote knowledge sharing and remove knowledge sharing obstacles, the organizational culture of an entity should encourage discovery and innovation.&lt;ref name=10Dal /&gt; Members who trust each other are willing to exchange knowledge and at the same time want to embrace knowledge from other members as well.
&lt;ref&gt;Levin, D.Z. &amp; Cross, R. (2004). The Strength of Weak Ties You Can Trust: The Mediating Role of Trust in Effective Knowledge Transfer. Management Science, Vol. 50, No. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to information technology systems==
Information technology (IT) systems are common tools that help facilitate knowledge sharing and knowledge management.&lt;ref name=13KMM /&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=14AKFT /&gt; --&gt; The main role of IT systems is to help people share knowledge through common platforms and [[electronic storage]] to help make access simpler, encouraging economic reuse of knowledge.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=14AKFT /&gt; --&gt; IT systems can provide codification, personalization, electronic repositories for information and can help people locate each other to communicate directly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=14AKFT /&gt; --&gt; With appropriate training and education, IT systems can make it easier for organizations to acquire, store or disseminate knowledge.&lt;ref name=13KMM /&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=14AKFT /&gt; --&gt;

==Economic theory==
In economic theory, knowledge sharing has been studied in the field of industrial organization and in the field of contract theory. In [[industrial organization]], Bhattacharya, Glazer, and Sappington (1992) have emphasized the importance of knowledge sharing in research joint ventures in a context of imperfect competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhattacharya|first=Sudipto|last2=Glazer|first2=Jacob|last3=Sappington|first3=David E.M|date=1992|title=Licensing and the sharing of knowledge in research joint ventures|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0531(92)90068-S|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=56|issue=1|pages=43–69|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(92)90068-s|issn=0022-0531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the theory of [[incomplete contracts]], Rosenkranz and Schmitz (1999, 2003) have used the Grossman-Hart-Moore property rights approach to study how knowledge sharing is affected by the underlying ownership structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenkranz|first=Stephanie|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=1999|title=Know-how disclosure and incomplete contracts|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0165-1765(99)00038-5|journal=Economics Letters|volume=63|issue=2|pages=181–185|doi=10.1016/s0165-1765(99)00038-5|issn=0165-1765|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenkranz|first=Stephanie|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2003|title=Optimal allocation of ownership rights in dynamic R&amp;D alliances|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0899-8256(02)00553-5|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=43|issue=1|pages=153–173|doi=10.1016/s0899-8256(02)00553-5|issn=0899-8256|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kulam''' or "Pagkukulam" is a form of [[folk magic]], specifically natural magic, practiced in the [[Philippines]].  It puts emphasis on the innate power of the self and a secret knowledge of ''Magica Baja'' or ''low magic''. Earth (soil), fire, herbs, spices, candles, oils and kitchenwares and utensils are often used for rituals, charms, spells and potions.

==Usage and related terms==

'''Mangkukulam''' (noun) is a person employing or using Kulam, ie the "witch". 

'''Kinukulam''' (noun) is the target of the Kulam. 

'''Nakulam''' (adj.) describes someone or something experiencing the effects of the Kulam. 

'''Kulamin''' (verb) means to bewitch or do magic on a thing or person.

'''Ipakulam''' (verb) means to have someone bewitch, bless or hex someone or something else.

==Places==
Kulam in the [[Philippines]] is said to be centered on the islands of [[Pampanga]] and [[Talalora, Samar|Talalora]], [[Samar|Western Samar]] and the province of [[Sorsogon]], where many of the country's [[faith healing|faith healers]] reside. Kulam also exists in many of the hinterlands, especially in Samar and Leyte.

However, Kulam itself is known and occurs anywhere on the Philippines.

==''Mangkukulam''==
The '''Mangkukulam''' (/mahng-koo-KOO-lam/) can be considered a Filipino witch, literally meaning "a practitioner of ''kulam''". Other terms are the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] ''brujo'' and ''bruja'' (masculine and feminine forms of "witch"; Filipinized as ''bruho'' and ''bruha''). The verb '''kulamin''' (/koo-LAH-min/) means "to bless or hex", while a curse is called a ''sumpâ'' (/soom-PA/), which can also be translated as a "vow" or "oath". The ''' Mangkukulam ''' may use a voodoo doll and a needle to cast spells on people they want to revenge on, but largely use natural magic and superstitions similar to an [[Arbularyo|Albularyo]], or ''witch doctor''. Both can be considered witches, but the main difference is that the ''Albularyo'' is more of a doctor who heals people, while a ''Mangkukulam'' is a malevolent person who tricks and curses others.

To date, there have been no media, research, or claims that "good ''mangkukulam''" exist, so it is fair to assume that the ''mangkukulam'' is the "bad witch" of Philippine witchcraft.

== Curses and remedies ==
The primary methods employed by a ''mangkukulam'' are candle lighting ritual, scrying or tawas, recitation of spells, and concocting potions. Modern popular culture also depicts the ''mangkukulam'' as using either photographs or the equivalent of a [[Voodoo doll]]. Modern popular culture also depicts ''mangkukulam'' as mainly only doing love potions and malicious curses, but more extreme depictions claim they can summon ghosts to haunt dolls, raise the dead (or at least control dead bodies), and other things related to necromancy.

A typical belief of ''mangkukulam'' is that curses are mitigated by finding the caster and bribing them to lift the curse. [[Superstition|Superstitious]] people still attribute certain illnesses or diseases to ''kulam''. This most often happens in rural areas, where an herbal doctor called an ''[[Arbularyo|Albularyo]]'' (/al-boo-LAR-yoh/), diagnoses a victim using a [[divination]] method called ''pagtatawas'' and helps the victim cure their malady.

Darker forms of remedies to kulam include Albularyos whipping the bewitched person with a '''Buntot Pagi''' (Stingray's Tail) until the afflicted is forced to divulge the witch's name and confronting them. This is done in the belief that the one who is getting hurt is the witch and not the bewitched.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Family at Falls of Clyde in New Lanark, Lanarkshire.jpg|thumb|Family at Falls of Clyde in New Lanark, Lanarkshire]] --&gt;

'''The Lanarkshire Area Tourism Partnership''' (formerly Lanarkshire Strategic Tourism Marketing Partnership) created the strategy for tourism and [[economic development]] in [[Lanarkshire]] under the brand ''VisitLanarkshire'' in 2005.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7829344.stm|title=Tourism action plan boosts jobs|work=BBC News|date=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership is made up of representatives from [[North Lanarkshire]] and [[South Lanarkshire]] councils, [[VisitScotland]], and private organisations across Lanarkshire, and is funded by the Lanarkshire Tourism Association. The development of tourism is in line with the objectives set out in the Lanarkshire Tourism Action Plan.&lt;ref name="visitscotland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitscotland.org/what_we_do/partnership_initiatives/area_tourism_partnerships/lanarkshire.aspx|title=Lanarkshire Tourism Action Plan|publisher=VisitScotland|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[partnership]]'s VisitLanarkshire initiative was introduced to support growth in the tourism sector, which has been higher than most other sectors in the local area&lt;ref name="wishawpress"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wishawpress.co.uk/wishaw-news/local-wishaw-news/wishaw-news/2009/11/25/lanarkshire-tourism-on-the-increase-76495-25241829/|title=Lanarkshire tourism on the increase |work=Wishaw Press|date=25 November 2009|first=Graham|last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; and makes a significant impact to Lanarkshire's [[economy]], attracting over 3 million [[Tourism|visitors]] a year and employing over 6,000 people.&lt;ref name="visitscotland_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitscotland.org/research_and_statistics/regions/western_scotland.aspx|title=Scottish Tourism Economic Activity Monitor (STEAM) 2011|publisher=VisitScotland|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the partnership's main tasks is to manage local information through its dedicated website [http://www.visitlanarkshire.com www.visitlanarkshire.com], launched in 2009 &lt;ref name="bbcnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8392840.stm|title=Tourism bosses in Lanarkshire cash in on 'staycations'|work=BBC News|date=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a [[database]] to help locals and tourists find information on towns, attractions, accommodation, news and events in Lanarkshire. This tool is useful as it helps 2,000 users a week to find information, and benefits in particular a local audience. [[Social media]] is another tool used to promote local events in the area to the public and to push seasonal marketing campaigns which provide visitor boosts in Spring and Autumn.

The partnership works in close contact with [[Lodging|accommodation]] providers and [[attractions]] in the area to maintain [[Requirement|standards]] set out by VisitScotland's quality grading schemes. Through the VisitLanarkshire name, the partnership also communicates the strategic aims set out by the ''Scottish Tourism Alliance'' to ensure its partners are working in parallel with the rest of [[Scotland]].

The partnership dedicated resources into producing a website promoting venues in Lanarkshire which was launched in 2012, after recognising that [[business tourism]] is a key growth sector in the tourism industry.

[[File:Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One Logo.jpg|thumb|Logo of the cancelled tour]]

'''Led Zeppelin – The 1980s, Part One''' was a planned autumn 1980 concert tour of North America by the rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. It was scheduled to take place from 17 October through 15 November of that year and cover much of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The band cancelled the tour when drummer [[John Bonham]] died on 25 September, one day after the group's initial rehearsal for the tour.

==Background==
In the wake of Led Zeppelin's turmoil-plagued [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|1977 American tour]], which ended abruptly with the sudden death of his son Karac, singer [[Robert Plant]] had become averse to touring America with the band. His reluctance to do so persisted despite the success of the ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' album and the band's return to the stage at the [[Knebworth Festival 1979|1979 Knebworth Festival]] after a two-year absence. Following the conclusion of Led Zeppelin's successful [[Tour Over Europe 1980]], however, Plant had a change of heart and informed Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] that he was willing to undertake an American tour with the band in the autumn of 1980. According to writer [[Mick Wall]], though,

{{cquote|Plant did, however, lay down some strict deal-breaker conditions: no tour should take him away from his family for longer than a month; the band would play a maximum of two shows back-to-back followed by a day off; and, as with the European tour, Superdomes were out, more modest venues in; the aim to re-establish 'contact' with the audience (and, by definition, themselves). Grant and the others wearily complied.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant had been concerned about the band's lengthy absence from one of its primary markets, and had correctly viewed the European tour as a way of rekindling Plant's interest in performing in America.  Relieved by Plant's change of heart and mindful of the singer's conditions, Grant began planning a nineteen-date tour covering the American East Coast and Midwest, and envisioned Led Zeppelin undertaking additional West Coast and UK tours in early 1981. The band began preparations for the tour with renewed optimism about Led Zeppelin's future, with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] in particular commenting that the band had "new energy"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; and was "almost in a rebirth situation."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; John Bonham's death, however, resulted in the scuttling of the band's touring plans, and ultimately in the demise of Led Zeppelin itself, with the breakup of the band officially announced on 4 December 1980.

While Jones's view of the state of Led Zeppelin on the eve of the 1980 North American tour was a positive one, writer [[Chris Welch]] saw things differently. In his biography of Peter Grant, Welch questioned the wisdom of the band undertaking a U.S. tour at that point in time:

{{cquote|It seems strange that Grant was quite so determined to get the band back to America, given all they had been through and the musicians' state of health. Was it just for the money? They already had an avalanche of income from record sales and publishing royalties. How many more cars, houses, farms, and antiques could they buy?&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002) p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Welch and writers Dave Lewis and Mick Wall particularly questioned John Bonham's physical and emotional fitness to tour North America at that stage. They note that by the fall of 1980 Bonham's dislike of touring, which had been steadily growing over the years, was virtually as strong as Plant's. He was particularly nervous about the potential backlash he might experience in the U.S. from his involvement in the backstage brawl at the Oakland Coliseum during Led Zeppelin's 1977 tour.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 219; Welch (2009), p. 140-141.&lt;/ref&gt; As Bonham grew older, moreover, the demands of touring—along with the effects of his alcohol and drug use—took an increasing toll on his energy and stamina, and by 1980 he was struggling with fatigue. He had already permanently dropped his lengthy drum solos from the band's onstage performances.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2009), p. 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt; While he came across to Lewis at the time as "delighted"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; about the upcoming trek, Bonham privately confided on the eve of the ill-fated rehearsals for ''Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One'' that he felt depressed and uneasy about going on tour, and that he felt his drumming was no longer up to scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly told Plant, "I've had it with playing drums. Everybody plays better than me. I'll tell you what, when we get to the rehearsal, you play the drums and I'll sing." &lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; After that initial rehearsal on 24 September, he complained again about going on tour while engaging in a drinking binge that would prove to be fatal.

Ironically, on 25 September, at the same time the rest of the band and its entourage were learning of Bonham's death, thousands of Led Zeppelin fans in Chicago were eagerly obtaining copies of that day's ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' containing mail order applications for the upcoming November concerts. This proved to be fruitless since the tour was immediately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 329-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the concerts on this tour, the band intended to use a scaled-down approach similar to the one they used for the European tour, which entailed fewer lighting effects, less improvisation, and fewer extended solos than their 1970s concerts. The previously rehearsed but unperformed ''In Through the Out Door'' track "[[Carouselambra]]" was included in the tentative set-list.

The '''''Madonna of Humility'''''  is a painting by [[Fra Angelico]] which belongs to the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]] in [[Madrid]] and is conserved on loan at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Guide of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.

== Description ==
The Virgin seated on a cushion placed directly on the ground with the child standing on her lap, holds a vase in her left hand which contains roses and a lily, symbols of motherhood and purity. The Child, who is also holding a lily, rests his forehead on his mother's cheek. They are set under a cloth of honour made of gold and black embroidered brocade held by three angels, while two more angels are seated on the ground playing an organ and a lute. The monumental figures, the splendour of the clothes, the modulated light and the use of the blue colour place this panel in the purest fifteenth-century Italian style. The work has been identified as the one described by [[Giorgio Vasari]] in 1568 in the home of the [[Gondi family]], in [[Florence]], where it formed part of a polyptic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=47ebcd8e6d370c6926ffc938f57f3dd871295ffedac166160908977bcfde952b?inventoryNumber=212817-000  The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Marville''''' is a 2002 [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The series was written by [[Bill Jemas]], and the stories involve satirical comments on comic book industry conventions and trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npIsZV7grboC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=marville+comics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r90cUZvmNOmKiAK5t4C4Ag&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=marville&amp;f=false |title=Marvel Graphic Novels and Related Publications: An Annotated Guide to Comics ... - Robert G. Weiner - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2008-03-17 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is regularly considered one of the worst comics of all time due to its confusing and rapidly-changing plots as well as its blatantly promotional nature.

==Overview==
The main character is Kal-[[AOL]] Turner, the son of [[Ted Turner]] and [[Jane Fonda]] from 5002. Kal-AOL is sent back in time via a [[Time travel|time machine]] made out of [[Video game console|video game systems]]. Despite having no superpowers, he tries to be a superhero. After some adventures as a Superhero, he and his friends decide to use their time machine to travel back to the origin of time and talk to God. Jack (who is never definitively stated to be God) takes Al and his friend through the times of the dinosaurs and neanderthals, explaining the origins of life and bestowing the secret of world peace to Al in the process. Al tries to have his story published as a series of comic books to share the secret of world peace, but is rejected because his story is not about superheroes or action.

The title is a reference to the TV series ''[[Smallville]]''; the cover of issue #1 features the main character tied up as a [[scarecrow]] with a red 'M' painted on his chest, much as [[Tom Welling]] is in the [[Pilot (Smallville)|first episode]] of ''Smallville'' and in related publicity material.

The series revisits several existing points of Marvel continuity in a completely irreverent and contradictory manner. For example, the issue titled "Originville" (referencing ''[[Origin (comics)|Origin]]'') visits a prehistoric setting in which [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is a mutant [[Neanderthal]]. Despite this, the series' main character, Kal-AOL Turner made a cameo appearance in the [[Marvel Universe]] series ''[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLA]]'' and received a profile in ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|The All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z]]''.

Issue #3 consists entirely of art with the separations, with the script superimposed over it.

The final issue of ''Marville'', issue #7, does not actually contain a story; instead, it contains the submissions guidelines to Marvel's new [[Epic Comics]] imprint.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fF0XachOwyYC&amp;pg=PT643&amp;dq=marville+comics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r90cUZvmNOmKiAK5t4C4Ag&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg |title=Marvel Comics: The Untold Story - Sean Howe - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U-Decide==
Marville was created as part of Marvel's U-Decide promotional campaign, in which fans would decide which of three books would survive. The event involved one existing book ([[Peter David]]'s ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'', whose numbering was restarted at issue #1) and two new books (''Marville'' and Ron Zimmerman's ''[[Ultimate Adventures]]''), and was based around a bet between David and Jemas, of which Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] later became a part. Jemas changed the stakes of the bet a few issues into ''Marville'', stating that the loser would take a pie in the face for charity. Despite this, both ''Marville'' and ''Ultimate Adventures'' ended fairly quickly, while the rebooted ''Captain Marvel'' would last 25 more issues, for a total of 60 issues when combined with the first run.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

==Reception==
For its confusing plot, wanton sexuality, and thinly-veiled promotional nature, ''Marville'' was universally panned by critics, and is regularly referred to as one of the worst comics of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thethings.com/the-15-worst-comics-ever-published/|title=The 15 Worst Comics Ever Published|date=2017-07-09|work=TheThings|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Machinima/status/866814450367582208|title=Machinima on Twitter|website=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cgccomics.com/boards/topic/4178-marville-the-worst-comic-book-ever/|title=Marville: The Worst Comic Book EVER|website=CGC Comic Book Collectors Chat Boards|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Comics Alliance]]'' included ''Marville'' in their list of the 15 Worst Comics of the Decade, calling it little more than a "publicity stunt,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Laura (December 17, 2009). [http://comicsalliance.com/the-15-worst-comics-of-the-decade/ "The 15 Worst Comics of the Decade"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924040315/http://comicsalliance.com/the-15-worst-comics-of-the-decade/ |date=2014-09-24 }}. Comics Alliance&lt;/ref&gt; and Rob Bricken of [[io9]] likened the work to "shooting heroin directly into your adrenal gland."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/10-comics-marvel-would-desperately-like-to-forget-they-1508292020|title=10 Comics Marvel Would Desperately Like to Forget They Published|last=Bricken|first=Rob|work=io9|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Screen Rant]]'' ranked Kal-AOL (and the rest of the Marville cast) as one of the superheroes that Marvel wants you to forget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrd|first1=Matthew|title=15 Superheroes Marvel Wants You To Forget|url=http://screenrant.com/worst-superheroes-marvel-wants-you-to-forget-embarassing/|website=Screen Rant|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The A.V. Club]]'' called it "abominable", "nearly unpublishable", and — despite its professional-quality production values — "fundamentally amateurish", condemning Jemas for using the Marvel corporation as "a [[vanity press]] for himself".&lt;ref name=AVClub&gt;[https://www.avclub.com/with-great-power-comes-a-bizarre-lack-of-responsibility-1798284127 With great power comes a bizarre lack of responsibility case file #44: ''Marville''], by Nathan Rabin, at ''[[The A.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4692">'''Mock Spanish''' is used to describe a variety of [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-inspired phrases common in some otherwise monolingual [[English-American|Anglo-American]] circles. The term "mock Spanish" has been popularized by anthropologist-linguist [[Jane H. Hill]] of the [[University of Arizona]], most recognizably in relation to the catchphrase, "[[Hasta la vista, baby]]", from the film, ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Jane H. (1993). "Hasta La Vista, Baby: Anglo Spanish in the American Southwest". Critique of Anthropology, 13(2):145-176.&lt;/ref&gt; Hill argues that the incorporation of pseudo-Spanish terms like "hasty banana" (for ''hasta mañana''), "buenos nachos" (for ''buenas noches''), "el cheapo", "[[no problemo]]", "hasta la bye-bye", and other humorous uses constitute a type of [[covert racism]].&lt;ref name="hill"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hill | first = Jane H. | title = Mock Spanish: A Site For The Indexical Reproduction Of Racism In American English | work = Language &amp; Culture, Symposium 2 | date = 1995-10-09 | url = http://language-culture.binghamton.edu/symposia/2/part1/index.html | accessdate = 2008-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many{{who |date=May 2018}} feel that this type of language is harmless and is a natural consequence of multiculturalism.

Hill found that mock Spanish was especially prevalent "among middle- and upper-income, college-educated whites".&lt;ref name="hill"/&gt;  She discovered that many of those who make use of mock Spanish  or [[mock language]] in their casual speech consider it harmless or even flattering, while native Spanish speakers are likely to find it insulting.  She presented an argument that mock Spanish depends on the covert indexing of negative stereotypes of Spanish speakers and that it can only be accurately interpreted if negative stereotypes about Hispanophones can be accessed.&lt;ref name="hill" /&gt; 

In ''José, can you see?'', Ana Celia Zentella describes mock Spanish as one half of a double-standard in which [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] are expected to conform to the linguistic norms of [[English language|English]] while Anglo-Americans are free to ignore all grammatical aspects of the Spanish language they are borrowing from. According to Zentella, {{cquote|Latin(a)s are visibly constrained by rigid norms of linguistic purity, but white linguistic disorder goes unchallenged; in fact, white linguistic disorder is essential to a congenial persona, and passes as multicultural 'with-it-ness.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Zentella|first= Ana Celia|year= 2003|editor= Doris Sommer|title= Bilingual Games|publisher= Palgrave Press|location= New York|isbn=978-1-4039-6012-2|chapter='José can you see': Latin@ responses to racist discourse|chapterurl= http://www.ethnicstudies.ucsd.edu/_files/miscellaneous/Jose%20can%20you%20see.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hill contrasts mock Spanish with two other registers of "Anglo Spanish" that she refers to as "Nouvelle Spanish" (largely used to provide a Spanish flavor for marketing purposes, e.g. "the land of ''mañana''" used to describe the Southwest or "Hair ''Casa''" as the name of a beauty salon) and "Cowboy Spanish" ([[loanword]]s for region-specific objects and concepts, such as ''coyote'', ''mesa'', and ''tamale'').&lt;ref name="hill"/&gt;

The '''modality effect''' is a term used in [[experimental psychology]], most often in the fields dealing with [[memory]] and [[learning]], to refer to how learner performance depends on the presentation mode of studied items.

==Description==
Modality can refer to a number of characteristics of the presented study material. However, this term is usually used to describe the improved recall of the final items of a list when that list is presented verbally in comparison with a [[Visual perception|visual]] representation. The effect is seen in [[free recall]] (recall of list items in any given order), [[Recall (memory)#Serial recall|serial recall]] (recall of list items in the order of study), short-term sentence recall (recall specific words from sentences with similar meanings) and paired associate recall (recall of a pair from presentation of one of its members). For paired associates, the effect is limited to an increased probability of recall for the final 2 or 3 pairs studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murdock|first=Bennet B.|title=Short-term Memory|journal=The psychology of learning and motivation:advances in research and theory|year=1972|volume=5|pages=67–127|doi=10.1016/s0079-7421(08)60440-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In free recall and serial recall, the modality effect is seen as simply an exaggerated recency effect in tests where presentation is auditory. In short-term sentence recall studies, emphasis is placed on words in a distractor-word list when requesting information from the remembered sentence. This demonstrates the modality effect can be more than auditory or visual.&lt;ref name='Goolkasian'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Modality Effects in Sentence Recall | journal = The Journal of General Psychology | year = 2009 | first = Paula | last = Goolkasian |author2=Paul W. Foos |author3=Mirrenda Eaton  | volume = 136 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–224| id =  | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3200/GENP.136.2.205-224 | accessdate = 2012-01-26 | pmid=19350835 | doi=10.3200/GENP.136.2.205-224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For serial recall, the modality effect is seen in an increased [[memory span]] for auditorally presented lists.  Memory span is defined as the maximum number of items that participants correctly recall in 50% of trials. Typically, studies find these to be seven digits, six letters and five words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crannell|first=C.W.|author2=Parish, J.M.|title=A comparison of immediate memory span for digits, letters and words|journal=Journal of Psychology|year=1957|volume=44|pages=319–327|doi=10.1080/00223980.1957.9713089}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study done by Drewnowski and Murdock, a visual list of English words was found to have an immediate recall of 4.82 words while an auditory representation of this same list led to a memory span of 5.36, a statistically significant variance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drewnowski|first=Adam|author2=Murdock, B.B.|title=The role of auditory features in memory span for words|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory|year=1980|volume=6|pages=319–332|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.6.3.319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies use the term modality to refer to a general difference in performance based upon the mode of presentation. For example, Gibbons demonstrated modality effects in an experiment by making participants count either beeping sounds or visually presented dots. The to-be-remembered number was derived from the number of dots or beeps counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibbons|first=Jeffrey A.|author2=Velkey, Andrew K. |author3=Partin, Kathren T. |title=Influence of recall procedures on the modality effect with numbers and enumerated stimuli|journal=Journal of General Psychology|date=January 2008|volume=135|pages=84–104|doi=10.3200/genp.135.1.84-104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In memory experiments, the modality effect is an example of source clustering, which refers to the tendency of items presented in the same modality to be grouped together during recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahana|first=Michael J.|author2=Polyn, Sean M. |author3=Norman, Keith A. |title=A Context Maintenance and Retrieval Model of Organizational Processes in Free Recall|journal=Psychological Review|year=2009|volume=116|pages=129–156|doi=10.1037/a0014420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within-list manipulations of modality affect recall probability, order of recall, and grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murdock|first=Benet B.|author2=Walker, Keith D.|title=Modality Effects in Free Recall|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|year=1969|volume=8|pages=665–676|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(69)80120-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bennet Murdock]] used a basic free recall paradigm, with different types of lists, mixing auditorally and visually presented words. The results he obtained showed that modality improved [[recency]] but did not affect recall for the pre-recency items. This effect was seen to be slightly larger when the items for study were presented more rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murdock|first=Bennet B.|author2=Walker, Kenneth D.|title=Modality effects in free recall|journal=Journal of Verbal Leaning and Verbal Behavior|year=1969|volume=8|pages=665–676|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(69)80120-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with mixed list presentations (lists presented both auditorally and visually in a single study period) the superiority of auditory study is seen in all serial positions, not just in recency. Murdock interprets this as evidence for separate short term stores for visual and auditory memory.

Glenberg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glenberg|first=Arthur M.|title=A retrieval account of the long-term modality effect|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=January 1984|volume=10|pages=16–31|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.10.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  showed that the modality effect is also prevalent in [[Long-term memory|long term memory]], showing that to-be-remembered word pairs that are separated by distractor activity are better recalled if presented auditorally vs. visually. By using techniques similar to Murdock’s free recall paradigm, plus the addition of varied amounts of distraction time (filled with counting backwards), Glenberg showed that the modality effect is not affected by a disruptive task and therefore is theoretically not restricted to [[Short-term memory|short term memory]].

Several terms have been used to refer to the modality effect on recency. Crowder and Morton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crowder|first=Robert G.|author2=Morton, John|title=Precategorical acoustic storage (PAS)|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|year=1969|volume=5|pages=365–373|doi=10.3758/bf03210660}}&lt;/ref&gt;  refer to it as PAS, or precategorical acoustic store. This and other similar terms([[echoic memory]], [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological loop]]) are used to explain a specialized short-term memory system store for phonological information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baddeley|first=A.D.|title=Working Memory|year=1986|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ein Konzert des Mozarteumorchesters Salzburg.jpg|thumb|A concert at the [[Großes Festspielhaus|Great Festival Hall]], Salzburg]] 
The '''Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg''' is an Austrian orchestra, based in the town and [[States of Austria|state]] of [[Salzburg]].  The orchestra gives concerts in several Salzburg venues, including the ''[[Großes Festspielhaus]]'', the Great Hall of the [[International Mozarteum Foundation|Stiftung Mozarteum]].  In addition to symphony orchestra concerts, the orchestra serves as accompanying ensemble for operas and musical theatre performances at the [[Salzburger Landestheater|Salzburg State Theater]].

The ensemble was founded in 1841 with the help of [[Mozart]]’s sons [[Franz Xaver Mozart|Franz Xaver]] and [[Karl Thomas Mozart|Karl Thomas]], as well as his widow [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]], under the musical direction of Alois Taux.  In 1908, the ensemble officially adopted the name "Mozarteum Orchestra".  The Mozarteum Orchestra participates regularly at the [[Salzburg Festival]], such as in the Festival's 'Mozart Matinees'.  It also performs several concerts at the Salzburg Mozart Week and for the Salzburg Cultural Association.  

In 2008, the Mozarteum Orchestra began a young project, '2 ORCHESTRAS', which presents new works for the combination of a professional orchestra and a youth orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://service.salzburg.gv.at/lkorrj/Index?cmd=detail_ind&amp;nachrid=41714 | title=Musik vereint Jugend aus aller Welt | publisher=Land Salzburg | date=29 October 2008 | accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Composers who have written works for this project have included [[Kurt Schwertsik]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.salzburg24.at/2-orchestras-mozarteum-orchester-salzburg-vergibt-5-auftragswerke/news-20080806-02591898 | title="2 Orchestras": Mozarteum Orchester Salzburg vergibt 5 Auftragswerke | work=Salzburg 24 | author= | date=2008-08-06 | accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Toshio Hosokawa]].

The orchestra's most recent chief conductor was [[Ivor Bolton]], from 2004 to 2016.  Bolton now has the title of ''Ehrendirigent'' (Honorary Conductor) with the orchestra.  In September 2016, Riccardo Minasi made his first guest-conducting appearance with the orchestra.  In December 2016, the orchestra announced the appointment of Minasi as its next chief conductor, effective September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.mozarteumorchester.at/pressemeldungen-reader/weisser-rauch-beim-mozarteumorchester-salzburg-riccardo-minasi-wird-neuer-chefdirigent.html | title=Weißer Rauch beim Mozarteumorchester Salzburg: Riccardo Minasi wird neuer Chefdirigent | publisher=Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg | date=19 December 2016 | accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Past principal guest conductors of the orchestra have included [[Trevor Pinnock]].  The orchestra's current principal guest conductor is [[Giovanni Antonini]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27308">'''Munchausen by Internet''' is a pattern of behavior akin to [[Munchausen syndrome]] (renamed [[factitious disorder imposed on self]]), a [[psychiatric disorder]], wherein those affected feign [[disease]], illness, or [[psychological trauma]] to draw attention, sympathy, or reassurance to themselves. In Munchausen by [[Internet]], users seek attention by feigning illnesses in online venues such as [[chat room]]s, [[message board]]s, and [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC). It is different from [[catfishing]], where the person feigns an identity to seek attention by [[online dating]]. It has been described in medical literature as a manifestation of factitious disorder imposed on self, or if claiming illness of a child or other family member, [[factitious disorder imposed on another]].&lt;ref name="feldman"/&gt; Reports of users who deceive Internet forum participants by portraying themselves as gravely ill or as victims of violence first appeared in the 1990s due to the relative newness of Internet communications. The pattern was identified in 1998 by psychiatrist Marc Feldman, who created the term "Münchausen by Internet" in 2000. It is not included in the fifth revision of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-5).

The development of factitious disorders in online venues is made easier by the availability of medical literature on the Internet, the anonymous and malleable nature of [[online identity|online identities]], and the existence of communication forums established for the sole purpose of giving support to members facing significant health or psychological problems. Several high-profile cases have demonstrated behavior patterns which are common among those who pose as gravely ill or as victims of violence, or whose deaths are announced to online forums. The virtual communities that were created to give support, as well as general non-medical communities, often express genuine sympathy and grief for the purported victims. When fabrications are suspected or confirmed, the ensuing discussion can create schisms in online communities, destroying some and altering the trusting nature of individual members in others.

== Characteristics ==

The term "Munchausen by Internet" was first used in an article published in the ''Southern Medical Journal'' written by Marc Feldman in 2000. Feldman, a [[clinical professor]] of psychiatry at the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]], gave a name to the phenomenon in 2000, but he co-authored an article on the topic two years earlier in the ''Western Journal of Medicine'', using the description "virtual factitious disorder".&lt;ref name="feldman2"/&gt; [[Factitious disorder]]s are described in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-IV-TR]]'' (DSM) as psychological disorders involving the production of non-existent physical or psychological ailments to earn sympathy. These illnesses are feigned not for monetary gain or to avoid inconvenient situations, but to attract compassion or to control others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychiatryonline.com/content.aspx?aID=9658 Factitious disorders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724112535/http://www.psychiatryonline.com/content.aspx?aID=9658 |date=2011-07-24 }}, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-IV-TR (Psychiatry Online). Retrieved on July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic manifestation of factitious disorder is often called [[Munchausen syndrome]], after a book about the exaggerated accounts of the adventures of [[Baron Munchausen]], a German cavalry officer in the Russian Army, that was written by [[Rudolf Erich Raspe]].&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, Barbara E.; Leamon, Martin H.; Feldman, Marc D.; Scott, Charles L. [http://www.psychiatryonline.com/content.aspx?aID=297551&amp;searchStr=munchausen+syndrome#297551 Chapter 14.

Retrieved on August 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldman noted that the advent of online [[support group]]s, combined with access to vast stores of medical information, enabled  individuals seeking to gain sympathy by relating a series of harrowing medical or psychological problems that defy comprehension to misuse the groups.&lt;ref name="feldman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Feldman MD |title=Munchausen by Internet: detecting factitious illness and crisis on the Internet |journal=South. Med. J. |volume=93 |issue=7 |pages=669–72 |date=July 2000 |pmid=10923952 |doi= 10.1097/00007611-200093070-00006|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication forums specializing in medical or psychological recovery were established to give lay users support in navigating often confusing and frustrating medical processes and bureaucracy. Communities often formed on those forums, with the goal of sharing information to help other members. Medical websites also became common, giving lay users access to literature in a way that was accessible to those without specific medical training. As Internet communication grew in popularity, users began to forgo the doctors and hospitals often consulted for medical advice. Frequenting virtual communities that have experience with a medical problem, Feldman notes, is easier than going through the physical pain or illness that would be necessary before visiting a doctor to get the attention sought. By pretending to be gravely ill, Internet users can gain sympathy from a group whose sole reason for existence is support.  Health care professionals, with their limited time, greater medical knowledge, and tendency to be more skeptical in their diagnoses, may be less likely to provide that support.&lt;ref name="feldman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shreve"&gt;Shreve, Jenn (June 6, 2001).

=== Behavior patterns===
People who demonstrate factitious disorders often claim to have physical ailments or be recovering from the consequences of [[stalking]], [[victimization]], [[harassment]], and [[sexual abuse]]. Several behaviors present themselves to suggest factors beyond genuine problems. After studying 21&amp;nbsp;cases of deception, Feldman listed the following common behavior patterns in people who exhibited Munchausen by Internet:
* Medical literature from websites or textbooks is often duplicated or discussed in great detail. 
* The length and severity of purported physical ailments conflicts with user behavior. Feldman uses the example of someone posting in considerable detail about being in [[septic shock]], when such a possibility is extremely unlikely. 
* Symptoms of ailments may be exaggerated as they correspond to a user's misunderstanding of the nature of an illness.
* Grave situations and increasingly critical prognoses are interspersed with "miraculous" recoveries.
* A user's posts eventually reveal contradictory information or claims that are implausible: for example, other users of a forum may find that a user has been divulging contradictory information about occurrence or length of hospital visits.
* When attention and sympathy decreases to focus on other members of the group, a user may announce that other dire events have transpired, including the illness or death of a close family member.
* When faced with insufficient expressions of attention or sympathy, a forum member claims this as a cause that symptoms worsen or do not improve.
* A user resists contact beyond the Internet, such as by telephone or personal visit, often claiming bizarre reasons for not being able to accept such contact.
* Further emergencies are described with inappropriate happiness, designed to garner immediate reactions.
* The posts of other forum members exhibit identical writing styles, spelling errors, and language idiosyncrasies, suggesting that the user has created [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|fictitious identities]] to move the conversation in their direction.&lt;ref name="feldman"/&gt;

==Causes==

Feldman has admitted in several interviews that he has been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue.&lt;ref name="grady"/&gt; As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others to feel as if the perpetrator is in control of his or her own life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying [[personality disorder]]s. Many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood.&lt;ref name="swains"/&gt; In a story published in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' in 2001, a woman recovering from factitious disorder remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, I got an adrenaline rush. I believe I got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't occur to me I was hurting anyone but myself."&lt;ref name="russo"/&gt; A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in ''The New York Times'' article, "People who do this need something. I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing over and over again in different shapes."&lt;ref name="grady"/&gt;

Feldman reports that most of the cases of Munchausen by Internet communicated to him come from the United States, although he has corresponded with forum members making inquiries from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Feldman reports parallel manifestations of factitious disorder, peaking between a person's 20s and 30s.&lt;ref name="swains"/&gt;

In an article published in ''The Guardian'', Steve Jones, a communications professor at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], gave his perspective on the Kaycee Nicole case. Jones credits the anonymity of the Internet for impeding people's abilities to realize when someone is lying: "Given the mutability of identity, how are we to negotiate social relations that, at least in the realm of face-to-face communication, were fixed by recognition of identity?"&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Jones, Steve [http://info.comm.uic.edu/jones/cybersoc.html Computer-Mediated Communication and Community: Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/19990824184755/http://info.comm.uic.edu/jones/cybersoc.html |date=1999-08-24 }}: Introductory chapter to ''CyberSociety'' (1995), Sage Publications. Retrieved on August 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Online interaction has only been possible since the 1980s, steadily growing over the years. After analyzing several cases of online deception and interaction, social theorists [[Adam Joinson]] and Beth Dietz-Uhler write in a 2002 ''Social Science Computer Review'' article that deception on the Internet is a paradox: the faceless nature of online communications not only gives opportunity to the unscrupulous and attention-seekers, but also allows earnest users to express themselves more freely, representing a truer version of themselves. Typically, Internet deception takes the form of changing one's sex or presenting one's own idealized image of oneself. Joinson and Dietz-Uhler cite a chapter in ''Network and Netplay'', in which researchers note the purpose of some forums is to allow their members to participate in a kind of online party, affording chances to pretend and perform: "the type of play on the Internet is usually allowed only in children or adults during masked balls or carnivals".&lt;ref name="joinson"&gt;Joinson, Adam; Dietz-Uhler, Beth (2002).

Rafaeli (Eds.), ''Network and Netplay: Virtual Groups on the Internet'' (pp. 41-76). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; More practical issues such as age, location, marital status, and occupation are also frequently changed online, or left ambiguous to preserve users' privacy or continue identity play.&lt;ref name="caspi"&gt;Caspi, Avner; Gorsky, Paul (November 1, 2006).

== Notable cases ==

Feldman's article in the ''Western Journal of Medicine'' was picked up by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in a story by Denise Grady, who described three cases of Internet forum members who were "incorrigible fakers".&lt;ref name="grady"&gt;Grady, Denise (April 23, 1998).[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/23/technology/faking-pain-and-suffering-in-internet-support-groups.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print "Faking Pain and Suffering In Internet Support Groups"], ''The New York Times'', Retrieved on July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; These include a woman with a professed [[eating disorder]] who posted to a support group saying she was reporting from an [[intensive care unit]] via her laptop computer, and claimed to have had a [[stroke]] while online, to be followed by her mother's posts declaring that she too had to be hospitalized; the original poster's father purportedly continued to update the online group. In another example, a teenager frequenting a forum for mothers with [[premature birth|premature infants]] – some of whom had endured lengthy, expensive, and painful medical procedures, or had died – claimed to have given birth to a premature baby and expressed her fears for her own child, after which she received support and sympathy from the 400-member group. The teenager confided to the group that her baby had also died, and soon after returned to the forum to announce she was again pregnant and feared her baby would be premature, which it turned out to be, more frail this time than the first. Forum members eventually became unsympathetic with her vivid descriptions of surgeries and confronted her. Grady also addresses a similar confrontation that occurred when a man who claimed to be a monk with end-stage cancer posted long descriptions of his trials and struggles with facing death alone, eventually arousing the suspicions of other forum members who were not convinced someone so sick could correspond with so much vitality.&lt;ref name="feldman2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grady"/&gt;

Some deceptions may take many months to unravel, such as a case that lasted over a year involving a 15-year-old boy participating in an online support group for people enduring debilitating [[migraine]] headaches. Some of the group's members had been on [[disability pension]] or gone through drug regimens for years to no avail. The boy represented his mother as deaf and his father as an alcoholic, and he reported seizures and [[hemophilia]] as complicating conditions.  However, he also claimed to be a medical student who performed as a drummer in a band.&lt;ref name="russo"/&gt; Resources of the forum became constantly directed at the boy, especially when some members expressed doubt about his story. The boy's mother—previously noted by him to be neglectful—logged on to post that questions about his conditions would worsen them; when they did not cease, he left the group, saying the atmosphere violated "the spirit of the internet".&lt;ref name="stein"&gt;Stein, Anne (February 23, 2003). "Fakers Invading Online Support - It Comes at the Expense of Ailing People Who Rely on Help From Groups", ''The Chicago Tribune'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet venues unrelated to medical issues have also been the audience for such cases. A member of an online fan club for the musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' divulged numerous illnesses that caused her to slip in and out of comas, prompting some cast members to send sympathy cards. When other fan club members expressed their concern, even purchasing airline tickets to visit the sick woman, she reported that she had immediately improved.&lt;ref name="russo"/&gt;

From 1999 to 2001 a 40-year-old homemaker named Debbie Swenson perpetrated a ruse under the identity [[Kaycee Nicole]], a 19-year-old woman in Kansas who shared the details of her battles with [[leukemia]] online. ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper reported that millions of Internet users read the fictional [[blog]], as well as Swenson's own blog, in which she posed as Kaycee Nicole's mother, describing the trials of living with an intelligent and optimistic daughter who was dying.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;Johnson, Bobbie (May 28, 2001).[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/may/28/internetnews.mondaymediasection/print "The Short Life of Kaycee Nicole"], ''[[The Guardian]]''.  Retrieved on July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 2001, Kaycee Nicole's death of an [[aneurysm]] was announced, shocking her readers and causing them intense grief. Soon however, Swenson caused skepticism in online communities. Although many cards and gifts had been previously sent, she refused to accept more. People began to learn that no one named Kaycee Nicole lived in [[Kansas]], had been enrolled in schools, or admitted to local hospitals, and no obituary had been printed.&lt;ref name="joinson"/&gt; The photo representing the girl was found to be that of a basketball player from [[Gracemont, Oklahoma]], who was alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=http://cjonline.com/stories/052601/kan_webhoax.shtml |title=Girl's illness was Web hoax; The Topeka Capital-Journal; May 26, 2001 |publisher=Cjonline.com |date=2001-05-26 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After repeated questioning, Swenson posted that she had woven the stories of three cancer patients to create the character of Kaycee Nicole, who had never existed.&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Hide paragraph until better source can be found Between 2004 and 2007, when she was exposed, a forum user called Emma Bowyer pretended to have multiple miscarriages on a forum used by many mothers. In one case, members of a forum collected money to send her flowers. She used other identities across several forums before her identity was revealed and she was forced to admit that she had made up most of what she had shared.&lt;ref name="bowyer"&gt;Why do people fake it online?

== Discovery and impact on online communities ==

Forum members whose ruses are discovered by their support groups are frequently banned from such communities—sometimes after demanding that site administrators do so—moving on to other websites to display other ailments. Denise Grady noted in ''The New York Times'' that the woman with the eating disorder moved to a group for sexual abuse survivors, then to another where she claimed to be dying of [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome|AIDS]].&lt;ref name="grady"/&gt; An article in ''[[The Australian|The Weekend Australian]]'' highlighted an example of this in 2003: a woman in London admitted to belonging to online support forums dedicated to helping members cope with migraines, grieving over dead children, and [[breast cancer]], all at the same time. She told a psychiatrist that she would study a specific malady and subsequently present herself with its symptoms; her time at each forum followed a daily schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Du Venage, Gavin (July 12, 2003). "Virtual Illness", ''The Weekend Australian'', p. C13.&lt;/ref&gt; Others disappear and simply stop posting, such as the monk who claimed to have cancer.&lt;ref name="feldman2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Feldman M, Bibby M, Crites S |date=Jun 1998 |title='Virtual' Factitious Disorders and Munchausen by Proxy |journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=168 |issue=6 |pages=537–540 |pmid=9656006 |pmc=1305082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When confronted with inaccuracies or inconsistencies, those who are suspected of perpetrating fabrications may compound the deceit by accusing forum members of imposing greater stresses upon them, exacerbating their conditions, or worsening their [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Users may employ [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppet]]s—separate online identities controlled by the same person—to accuse other forum members of disloyalty and persecution, or support the user who is under suspicion.&lt;ref name="feldman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swains"/&gt; Feldman's 1998 article in the ''Western Journal of Medicine'' notes a case in which a member of a support group for people with [[Chronic Fatigue Syndrome]] created a husband, sister-in-law, and family friend who simultaneously engaged in arguments with and about the original member; when the amount of attention directed toward the original member became inadequate, she claimed the sister-in-law committed suicide in response to the lack of support.&lt;ref name="feldman2"/&gt;

Other perpetrators suggest that their lying may actually assist group members, as one member of a [[Harry Potter]] fan forum posted following the discovery that she had not, in fact, died of [[tuberculosis]]: "After realising the effect my bravery in my illness had on people, I then used it as a vehicle to try and get some of the idiot emo kids on [the forum] to buck up and realise they don't really have it all that bad...the lie was worth something, wasn't it? How bad is a lie if it helps?"&lt;ref name="swains2"&gt;Swains, Howard (June 17, 2009). [https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2009-03/24/reports-of-my-death.aspx?lsd "Reports of My Death"], Wired.com. Retrieved on July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because no money is exchanged and laws are rarely broken, there is little legal recourse to take upon discovery of someone faking illness. However, a participant in a 7,000-member online support group brought a lawsuit against a website for defamatory language in 2005. The lawsuit followed heated discussion on the website about his dire predicaments and related crises, which seemed to contradict medical knowledge and his own accounts. The lawsuit was withdrawn after the presiding judge intended to allow cross-examination of the plaintiff's medical history.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Marc; Peychers, M.E. (September–October 2007). "Legal Issues Surrounding the Exposure of 'Munchausen by Internet'", ''Psychosomatics'', '''48''' (5), pp. 451–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such dramatic situations often polarize online communities.  Many members feel ashamed for believing elaborate lies, while others remain staunch supporters. Members who admit to feigning their conditions often respond by implicating the gullibility of forum members, suggesting that it is their own fault for being deceived.&lt;ref name="feldman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kruse"&gt;Kruse, Michael (February 28, 2010). "Death and Betrayal in Chat Room", ''The St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida), p. 1A.&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman admits that an element of [[Sadomasochism|sadism]] may be evident in some of the more egregious abuses of trust.&lt;ref name="swains"&gt;Swains, Howard (March 25, 2009).

Retrieved on July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Pam Cohen, a grief counselor who witnessed the outpouring of emotion for [[Kaycee Nicole]], likened the personal devastation resulting from genuine concern, sympathy, and support that forum members gave to the 19-year-old and her mother, only to discover that none of it was true, to "emotional rape".&lt;ref name="shreve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="russo"&gt;Russo, Francine (June 26, 2001).

Retrieved on July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Joinson and Beth Dietz-Uhler, in ''Social Science Computer Review'', address deception perpetrated on some forums—specifically IRC and [[MUD|multi-user dungeons]]—and state that masquerading is so common that hoaxes are expected, and their perpetrators are sometimes even praised for creating realistic ones.&lt;ref name="joinson"/&gt;

Other perpetrators react by issuing general accusations of dishonesty to everyone, following the exposure of such fabrications. The support groups themselves often bar discussion about the fraudulent perpetrator, in order to avoid further argument and negativity. Many forums do not recover, often splintering or shutting down.&lt;ref name="shreve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="russo"/&gt; In 2004, members of the blog hosting service [[LiveJournal]] established a forum dedicated to investigating cases of members of online communities dying—sometimes while online. Writer Howard Swains referred to the online deaths as "pseuicides" in [[Wired.com]].&lt;ref name="swains2"/&gt; ''New Zealand PC World Magazine'' called Munchausen by Internet "cybermunch", and those who posed online "cybermunchers".&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Belinda (October 21, 2002).

'''''My Life Me''''' is a short-lived [[France|French-]][[Canada|Canadian]] animated television series created by JC Little, Cindy Filipenko and [[Svetlana Chmakova]], co-directed by [[Mr. Niko]]. The teen slice-of-life comedy follows Birch Small, a [[manga]] and [[anime]] fan with aspirations of being a comic artist, as she tries to survive high school.  The show features [[Manga iconography|manga symbols]] such as sweatdrops, speech bubbles, and [[super-deformed]] [[Chibi (term)|chibi]] characters.

The series first aired on the French-language [[Télétoon]] on September 19, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=154893441202186&amp;id=294188272418 |title="3 et moi" Nouvelle série sur Teletoon... - DOUBLAGE - Nicolas Charbonneaux |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown on the English-language channel [[Teletoon]] from September 5, 2011&lt;ref name=crtclogs /&gt; to September 30, 2011.&lt;ref name=crtclogs&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://support.crtc.gc.ca/logs/|title=Television Program Logs|date=2016-03-02|publisher=[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/support_crtc_gc_ca15052016|archive-date=2016-05-16|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''My Life Me'' received a development deal in 2006 from [[Teletoon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelcanada.com/Article1475.html|title=TELETOON Announces 9 New Development Deals|date=July 24, 2006|publisher=ChannelCanada.com|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was a co-production between [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[France|French]] companies. The episodes were animated using [[Toon Boom Animation#Harmony|ToonBoom Harmony]], and the animation was split episodically between Toutenkartoon in [[Montreal|Montreal, Canada]], and [[Caribara]] in [[Angoulême|Angoulême, France]]. Backgrounds were created in [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]], then [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]], rendered and imported into Harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.toonboom.com/sites/default/files/pdf/customer_story/harmonycs2011-06carpediem.pdf|title=CarpeDiem Goes Manga with Harmony|date=June 29, 2011|publisher=toonboom.com|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animators did a hybrid of digital and hand drawn to help the fluidity in the animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/a-graphic-take-on-tweens/|title=A Graphic Take on Tweens|date=April 1, 2009|last=Zahed|first=Ramin|publisher=Animation Magazine Inc.|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animated digitally, [[Manga iconography|manga aesthetics]] were given homage "using various comic book manga codes and language such as stylish black and white comic book panels dropping behind the characters to express their suppressed feelings on screen." Even before production began My Life Me was planned to be "developed as a lifestyle brand, there will be a licensing and merchandising program to support the brand with a strong emphasis on publishing, accessories, gifts, stationery, apparel as well as a strong online component with a fully interactive website currently in production." The planned delivery of the series, shorts, and website was fall 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moody|first=Annemarie|title=New Tween Animated Series My Life Me Greenlighted|url=http://www.awn.com/news/television/new-tween-animated-series-my-life-me-greenlighted|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''My Life Me'' was "at the top of German co-production group TV-Loonland's offering in the 2009 autumn TV markets". In early 2010, TV-Loonland filed for bankruptcy/insolvency and its assets were sold off. My Life Me, at the time still in production, was one of such properties. The series was acquired by [[Classic Media]] in February. Classic Media took control of all media iterations of the property including the planned "heavily interactive" website. "Other than the television series, fifty-two eleven-minute episodes, the property is reported to include music video clips and more for mobile, online, and video on-demand distribution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anime/Manga-Inspired My Life Me Sold to Classic Media|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-02-20/anime/manga-inspired-my-life-me-sold-to-classic-media|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bynum|first=Aaron|title='My Life Me' Animation Now in New Hands|url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=2339|publisher=Animation Insider|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
Birch Small's school system requires her and her classmates, Liam, Sandra, and Raffi to work together in a group known around the school as a "Pod." The students don't get to choose who they are partnered up with; they must work together, despite their differences and shortcomings.

==Characters==
* Birch Small ({{Lang-fr|Béa Petit}}; Voiced by Sara Camacho in English version, and Claudia Laurie Corbeil in French version): A young talented artist and manga fan. Birch is 13 years old. Birch has a crush on Raffi as hinted in a number of episodes, and is shown to be very familiar with almost anything involving art, including various historical artist names. Her interest in Raffi and trying to impress him has her often doing absurd things, such as becoming vegetarian simply because Raffi was conflicted with her love of fast foods and meaty foods. She is also heavily interested with Japanese manga and is usually seen drawing these comics in said style.

* Liam Coll (Voiced by Mark Hauser in English version, and Nicolas Charbonneaux-Collombet in French version): 13-year-old cousin of Birch. Very little is known about Liam other than he's very close to Birch as he's often seen in Birch's house for one reason or another, usually looking for a good time. His goofy personality often causes problems, even getting himself into a "duel" with another kid in school unintentionally; however, his personal skills and specialties have their uses and can come out to help and often come out to help his "pod" in tight situations. He loves music, is easily jealous of Raffi over his popularity. Liam also expresses a rather continuous problem of being unable to "find himself" as that he can't find one thing he wants to be or one thing to fully define himself as he will often express a different hobby or interest in different episode. It's expressed that he's been doing this since grade 6. Like Birch, Liam is heavily into manga, and contributes the plot and writing to Birch's illustrations.

* Sandra le Blanc (Voiced by Stephanie Buxton in English version, and Emilie Bibeau in French version): A 13-year-old skateboarding fan and highly athletic girl who likes to take things to the extreme, such as getting volunteers to do a skateboard jump over. She has a rather devious and somewhat sadistic personality, as she often will do things to earn the discomfort and embarrassment of others for her own entertainment, and often would go so far as to try to get others including members of her "pod" to get angry at each other again for her own entertainment. She constantly denies of her "geek phase" that she had before, instead constantly bashing her own pod's geeky moments.

* Raffi Rodriguez (Voiced by [[Justin Bradley]] in English version, and Emile Mailhiot in French version): Love interest of Birch. Often considered the coolest guy in school, he often gets chosen for events and fund-raisers, much to the jealousy of other males such as Liam. He is 13 years old and, often concerned about his looks and often expresses that as his only concern at times. He's shown to care for Birch considerably, whether or not he reciprocates Birch's feelings has yet to be shown. One of the ways the official website has described him as, "would drive anyone crazy if he wasn't so darn nice".

==Plot==
Literature graduate Wyman Chan ([[Chapman To]]) writes erotic stories in the soft porn section of the newspaper for a living, but with the soft porn section ceasing publication, he loses his job. The unemployed Chan becomes capricious, and takes inspiration from men working in the Japanese adult video (AV) industry to become a producer of [[pornographic film]]s. Chan's idea immediately receives enthusiastic responses from his friends, who offer their help—especially Hatoyama ([[Josie Ho]]), who is familiar with the Japanese porn industry. While everyone initially takes great interest in being a part of filming, Chan is soon forced into acting in the lead role. Surprisingly, Chan becomes a sensation in Japan for his performance of being [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] and dominated by women in the AV. Hatoyama immediately travels to Hong Kong to persuade Chan to pursue his unrealistic dream—a Hong Kong man entering the Japanese AV industry.

The "'''National Anthem of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania'''" was [[Mauritania]]'s former [[national anthem]] between 1960 and 2017. Its lyrics are taken from a poem written in the late 18th century by Baba Ould Cheikh. The melody was arranged by [[Tolia Nikiprowetzky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/mauritania-national-anthem-of-mauritania/ | title=National Anthem of Mauritania | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2012-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalanthems.info/mr-17.htm | title=Mauritania (1960–2017) | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2018-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthem was adopted upon independence [[French Mauritania|from France]] in 1960. The unusual and highly complex rhythm of it makes it extremely difficult to sing; for this reason it is often erroneously listed as wordless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalanthems.info/mr-17.htm | title=Mauritania (1960–2017) | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2018-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthem was replaced by the [[National anthem of Mauritania|current national anthem]] on 16 November 2017, after the [[Mauritanian constitutional referendum, 2017|Mauritanian constitutional referendum of 2017]].

كن للاله ناصرا وأنكر المناكرا
وكن مع الحق الذي يرضاه منك دائرا
ولا تعد نافعا سواه أو ضائرا
واسلك سبيل المصطفى ومت عليه سائرا
فما كفى أولنا أليس يكفي الآخرا
وكن لقوم احدثوا في أمره مهاجرا
قد موهوا بشبه واعتذروا معاذرا
وزعموا مزاعما وسودوا دفاترا
واحتنكوا أهل الفلا واحتنكوا الحواضرا
وأورثت أكابر بدعتها أصاغرا
وإن دعا مجادل في أمرهم إلى مرا
فلا تمار فيهم إلا مراء ظاهرا

Soyez une aide pour Dieu, et censurez ce qui est interdit
Et tournez avec la loi qu'Il veut que vous suivez
Ne tenez personne pour utile ou nuisible, à l'exception de Lui 
Et marchez sur le chemin de l'élu, et mourez pendant que vous êtes dessus! 
Car ce qui était suffisant pour le premier d'entre nous, est aussi suffisant pour le dernier
Et laissez les gens qui font du mal à l'égard de Dieu
Ils l'ont déformé en le faisant similaire, et fait toutes sortes d'excuses, 
Ils ont présenté des demandes impudentes, et noirci des carnets,
Ils laissèrent les nomades et les sédentaires faire des expériences amères, 
Et les grands péchés de leurs innovations léguèrent peu 
Et juste au cas où un différend, vous appelle à disputer au sujet de leurs revendications, 
Alors, ne litige pas sur eux, sauf par voie d'un conflit externe
&lt;/poem&gt;
| &lt;poem&gt;
Be a [[Ansar (Islam)|helper for God]], and [[Haram|censure what is forbidden]]
And turn with [[Sharia|the law]] which He wants you to follow
Hold no one to be useful or harmful, except for Him
And walk the path of the chosen one and die while you are on it!
For what was sufficient for the first of us, is sufficient for the last one, too
And leave those people who do evil things with respect to God
They misrepresented Him by making Him similar, and made all kinds of excuses
They made bold claims and blackened notebooks
They let the nomads and the sedentary people both undergo bitter experiences
And the great sins of their [doctrinal] innovations bequeathed small
And just in case a disputant calls you to dispute about their claims
Do not, then, dispute on them, except by way of an external dispute
&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Piplantri''' a village located in [[Rajsamand district]] in [[Rajasthan]] State, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A village that plants 111 trees for every girl born in Rajasthan|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/a-village-that-plants-111-trees-for-every-girl-born-in-rajasthan/article4606735.ece|accessdate=26 March 2015|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notability==
The villagers of Piplantri plants 111 trees every time a girl child is born and the community ensures these trees survive, attaining fruition as the girls grow up. India has a huge deficit of girls thanks to a society obsessed with boys. Over the years, people here have managed to plant over 300 000 trees on the village's grazing commons - including [[Neem]], [[Dalbergia sissoo|Sheesham]], [[Mango]], [[Phyllanthus emblica|Amla]] among others.

To ensure financial security, after the birth of a girl child, the villagers contribute Rs 21,000 collectively and take Rs 10,000 from the parents and put it in a fixed deposit bank account, which can be used only after she turns 20. To make sure that girl child receives proper education, the villagers make the parents sign an affidavit (legal contract) which restricts them from marrying her off before she attains the legal age for marriage.

Shyam Sundar Paliwal, the former [[sarpanch]] (elected village head) started this initiative in the memory of his daughter Kiran, who died a few years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating girl child: Here's what India can learn from a Rajasthani village, Piplantri|url=http://www.firstpost.com/business/living-business/celebrating-girl-child-heres-what-india-can-learn-from-rajasthani-village-piplantri-2164571.html|website=www.firstpost.com|publisher=Firstpost|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative that began in 2006 has turned Piplantri village into an oasis. The birth of a girl child is now welcomed and the village is covered with Neem, Mango, Amla and Sheesham trees leading to a higher water level and richer wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piplantri villagers plant 111 trees to celebrate a girl child's birth|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/piplantri-villagers-plant-100-trees-to-celebrate-a-girl-childs-birth/406684-3-239.html|website=http://ibnlive.in.com|publisher=Cable News Network LP, LLLP. A Time Warner Company.|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative has also helped the town’s economy. To keep termites away from the trees, many of which bear fruit, the village has planted more than 2.5 million [[Aloe vera]] plants around them. Gradually, the villagers realized that Aloe vera could be processed and marketed in a variety of ways. So the community now produces and markets aloe-based products like juice and gel, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Village Plants Future for Young Girls|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/06/13/indian-village-plants-future-for-young-girls/|website=time.com|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Resurrection''' is the concept of coming back to life after [[death]]. In a number of ancient religions, a [[dying-and-rising god]] is a deity which dies and resurrects. 

The [[resurrection of the dead]] is a standard [[Eschatology|eschatological]] belief in the [[Abrahamic religions]]. As a religious concept, it is used in two distinct respects: a belief in the resurrection of individual [[soul]]s that is current and ongoing ([[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Christian idealism]], [[realized eschatology]]), or else a belief in a singular [[resurrection of the dead]] at the [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]. Some believe the soul is the actual vehicle by which people are resurrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gregory of Nyssa: "On the Soul and the Resurrection:" However far from each other their natural propensity and their inherent forces of repulsion urge them, and debar each from mingling with its opposite, none the less will the soul be near each by its power of recognition, and will persistently cling to the familiar atoms, until their concourse after this division again takes place in the same way, for that fresh formation of the dissolved body which will properly be, and be called, resurrection |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf205.x.iii.ii.html |publisher=Ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]] and [[resurrection of Jesus]], an example of resurrection, is the central focus of [[Christianity]]. Christian theological debate ensues with regard to what kind of resurrection is factual&amp;nbsp;– either a ''spiritual'' resurrection with a [[spirit]] body into [[Heaven]], or a material resurrection with a restored [[human body]].&lt;ref&gt;As in the [[Apostle's Creed]]: "I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting."  [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12792a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: General Resurrection]: "Resurrection is the rising again from the dead, the resumption of life. The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215) teaches that all men, whether [[Chosen people#Christianity|elect]] or [[reprobate]], "will rise again with their own bodies which they now bear about with them" (chapter "''Firmiter''"). In the language of the [[creed]]s and professions of faith this return to life is called resurrection of the body (''resurrectio carnis, resurrectio mortuoram, anastasis ton nekron'') for a double reason: first, since the [[Immortality of the soul|soul cannot die]], it cannot be said to return to life; second the [[heretical]] contention of [[Hymenaeus (Ephesian)|Hymeneus and Philitus]] that the [[Scriptures]] denote by resurrection not the return to life of the body, but the rising of the soul from the death of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] to the life of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]], must be excluded."&lt;/ref&gt; While most Christians believe [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus' resurrection from the dead]] and [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension to Heaven]] was in a material body, a very small minority believe it was spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=R. C. |last=Symes |title=According to Paul of Tarsus, the resurrection transformed Jesus into the Christ, the Son of God and Savior of the world. Christ's resurrected body was not a resuscitated physical body, but a new body of a spiritual/celestial nature: the natural body comes first and then the spiritual body (1 Cor. 15:46). Paul never says that the earthly body becomes immortal. |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/symes01.htm |publisher=religioustolerance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower Society claims that Jesus was not raised in His actual physical human body, but rather was raised as an invisible spirit being—what He was before, the archangel Michael.  They believe that Christ's post-Resurrection appearances on earth were on-the-spot manifestations and materializations of flesh and bones, with different forms, that the Apostles did not immediately recognize.  Their explanation for the statement "a spirit hath not flesh and bones" is that Christ was saying that he was not a ghostly apparition, but a true materialization in flesh, to be seen and touched, as proof that he was actually raised. But that, in fact, the risen Christ was, in actuality, a divine spirit being, who made himself visible and invisible at will.  The Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses believes that Christ’s perfect manhood was forever sacrificed at Calvary, and that it was not actually taken back. They state: "...in his resurrection he ‘became a life-giving spirit.’ That was why for most of the time he was invisible to his faithful apostles... He needs no human body any longer... The human body of flesh, which Jesus Christ laid down forever as a ransom sacrifice, was disposed of by God’s power."—Things in Which it is Impossible for God to Lie, pages 332, 354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gospel-mysteries.net/resurrection-theories.html |title=Resurrection Theories |publisher=Gospel-mysteries.net |date= |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are documented rare cases of the return to life of the [[Clinical death|clinically dead]] which are classified scientifically as examples of the [[Lazarus syndrome]], a term originating from the biblical story of the [[resurrection of Lazarus]].

==Etymology==
Resurrection, from the Latin noun ''resurrectio -onis'', from the verb ''rego'', "to make straight, rule" + preposition ''sub'', "under", altered to ''subrigo'' and [[Syncope (phonology)|contracted to]] ''surgo, surrexi, surrectum'' ("to rise", "get up", "stand up"&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Ernst Georges]], Ferruccio Badellino, Oreste Calonghi, ''Dizionario Latino-Italiano'' (''Latin to Italian dictionary''), Rosenberg &amp; Sellier, 3rd edition, [[Turin]], 1989, 2.957 pages&lt;/ref&gt;) + preposition ''re-'', "again",&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; thus literally "a straightening from under again".

==Religion==

===Ancient religions in the Near East===
{{See also|Dying-and-rising god}}
The concept of resurrection is found in the writings of some ancient non-Abrahamic religions in the [[Middle East]]. A few extant [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] and [[Canaan]]ite writings allude to [[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and rising gods]] such as [[Osiris]] and [[Baal]]. Sir [[James Frazer]] in his book ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' relates to these dying and rising gods,&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[James Frazer]] (1922). ''The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion'' Ware: Wordsworth 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; but many of his examples, according to various scholars, distort the sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Z. Smith]] "Dying and Rising Gods" in Mircea Eliade (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of Religion: Vol. 3''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan 1995: 521-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a more positive position, [[Tryggve Mettinger]] argues in his recent book that the category of rise and return to life is significant for the following deities: Ugaritic [[Baal]], [[Melqart]], [[Adonis]], [[Eshmun]], [[Osiris]] and [[Tammuz (deity)|Dumuzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Mettinger, ''Riddle of Resurrection'', 55-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greek religion===
In [[ancient Greek religion]] a number of men and women were made physically [[Immortality|immortal]] as they were resurrected from the dead. [[Asclepius]] was killed by Zeus, only to be resurrected and transformed into a major deity. [[Achilles]], after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother [[Thetis]] and resurrected, brought to an immortal existence in either Leuce, [[Elysium|Elysian plains]] or the [[Fortunate Isles|Islands of the Blessed]]. [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. [[Alcmene]], [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], [[Heracles]], and [[Melicertes]], were also among the figures sometimes considered to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to [[Herodotus]]'s [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]], the seventh century BC sage [[Aristeas of Proconnesus]] was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. Later he found not only to have been resurrected but to have gained immortality.

Many other figures, like a great part of those who fought in the [[Trojan war|Trojan]] and Theban wars, [[Menelaus]], and the historical pugilist [[Cleomedes of Astupalaea]], were also believed to have been made physically immortal, but without having died in the first place. Indeed, in Greek religion, immortality originally always included an eternal union of body and soul. The philosophical idea of an [[immortal soul]] was a later invention, which, although influential, never had a breakthrough in the Greek world. As may be witnessed even into the [[Christian era]], not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, traditional Greek believers maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that for the rest of us, we could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead souls.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Rohde]] ''Psyche: The Cult of Souls and Belief in Immortality among the Greeks''. New York 1925 [1921]&lt;/ref&gt;

This traditional religious belief in physical immortality was generally denied by the [[Greek philosophers]]. Writing his ''Lives of Illustrious Men'' ([[Parallel Lives]]) in the first century CE, the [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonic]] philosopher [[Plutarch]]'s chapter on [[Romulus]] gave an account of the mysterious disappearance and subsequent deification of this first king of Rome, comparing it to traditional Greek beliefs such as the resurrection and physical immortalization of Alcmene and Aristeas the [[Proconnesian]], "for they say Aristeas died in a fuller's work-shop, and his friends coming to look for him, found his body vanished; and that some presently after, coming from abroad, said they met him traveling towards Croton." Plutarch openly scorned such beliefs held in traditional ancient Greek religion, writing, "many such improbabilities do your fabulous writers relate, deifying creatures naturally mortal."

The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of Jesus was not lost on the early Christians, as [[Justin Martyr]] argued: "when we say ... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus." (''1 Apol.'' 21). There is, however, no belief in a general resurrection in ancient Greek religion, as the Greeks held that not even the gods were able to recreate flesh that had been lost to decay, fire or consumption. The notion of a ''general'' resurrection of the dead was therefore apparently quite preposterous to the Greeks. This is made clear in [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]'s [[Areopagus]] discourse. After having first told about the resurrection of Jesus, which makes the Athenians interested to hear more, Paul goes on, relating how this event relates to a general resurrection of the dead:
{{quote|
"Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all everywhere should repent, because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead." Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some began to sneer, but others said, `We shall hear you again concerning this.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:30-32;&amp;version=49 |title=Acts 17:30-32 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Judaism and Samaritanism===
{{main|Jewish eschatology}}
There are three explicit examples in the Hebrew Bible of people being resurrected from the dead:
* The prophet [[Elijah]] prays and God raises a young boy from death ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2017:17-24;&amp;version=49; 1 Kings 17:17-24])
* [[Elisha]] raises the son of the Shunammite woman ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%204:32-37;&amp;version=49; 2 Kings 4:32-37]); this was the very same child whose birth he previously foretold ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%204:8-16;&amp;version=49; 2 Kings 4:8-16])
* A dead man's body that was thrown into the dead Elisha's tomb is resurrected when the body touches Elisha's bones ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%2013:21;&amp;version=49; 2 Kings 13:21])

During the [[Second Temple period|period of the Second Temple]], there developed a diversity of beliefs concerning the resurrection. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in [[2 Maccabees]], according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;2 Maccabees 7.11, 7.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]],&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch 61.5, 61.2.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]],&lt;ref&gt;2 Baruch 50.2, 51.5&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2 Esdras]]. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism [[Philip R. Davies]], there is “little or no clear reference … either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead” in the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Davies. “Death, Resurrection and Life After Death in the Qumran Scrolls” in Alan J. Avery-Peck &amp; Jacob Neusner (eds.) ''Judaism in Late Antiquity: Part Four: Death, Life-After-Death, Resurrection, and the World-To-Come in the Judaisms of Antiquity.'' Leiden 2000:209.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Josephus]] and the New Testament record that the [[Sadducees]] did not believe in an [[afterlife]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus Antiquities 18.16; Matthew 22.23; Mark 12.18; Luke 20.27; Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; but the sources vary on the beliefs of the [[Pharisees]]. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not.&lt;ref&gt;Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Josephus]], who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will “pass into other bodies,” while “the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.”&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Jewish War'' 2.8.14; cf. ''Antiquities'' 8.14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], who also was a Pharisee,&lt;ref&gt;Acts 23.6, 26.5.&lt;/ref&gt; said that at the resurrection what is "sown as a natural body is raised a spiritual body."&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 15.35-53&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]] seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;Jubilees 23.31&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Herbert C. Brichto, writing in Reform Judaism's ''[[Hebrew Union College Annual]]'', the family tomb is the central concept in understanding biblical views of the [[afterlife]].  Brichto states that it is "not mere sentimental respect for the physical remains that is...the motivation for the practice, but rather an assumed connection between proper [[sepulture]] and the condition of happiness of the deceased in the afterlife".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jewish Views of the Afterlife|last=Raphael|first=Simcha Paull|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2009|isbn=9780742562202|location=Lanham, MD|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Brichto, the early [[Israelites]] apparently believed that the graves of family, or tribe, united into one, and that this unified collectivity is to what the [[Biblical Hebrew]] term [[Sheol]] refers, the common Grave of humans. Although not well defined in the Tanakh, Sheol in this view was a subterranean underworld where the souls of the dead went after the body died.  The [[Babylonians]] had a similar underworld called [[Abzu|Aralu]], and the [[Greeks]] had one known as [[Hades]].  For biblical references to Sheol see Genesis 42:38, Isaiah 14:11, Psalm 141:7, Daniel 12:2, Proverbs 7:27 and Job 10:21,22, and 17:16, among others. According to Brichto,  other Biblical names for Sheol were: Abaddon (ruin), found in Psalm 88:11, Job 28:22 and Proverbs 15:11;  Bor (the pit), found in Isaiah 14:15, 24:22, Ezekiel 26:20; and Shakhat (corruption), found in Isaiah 38:17, Ezekiel 28:8.&lt;ref name="Kin, Cult p.8"&gt;Herbert Chanon Brichto "Kin, Cult, Land and Afterlife&amp;nbsp;– A Biblical Complex", Hebrew Union College Annual 44, p.8 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:Pilon-risenchrist2.jpg|thumb|Resurrection of Jesus]]
In [[Christianity]], resurrection most critically concerns the [[resurrection of Jesus]], but also includes the resurrection of [[Judgment Day]] known as the resurrection of the dead by those Christians who subscribe to the [[Nicene Creed]] (which is the majority or [[Mainstream Christianity]]), as well as the resurrection miracles done by Jesus and the prophets of the [[Old Testament]] (see Judaism and Samaritanism below).

====Resurrection of Jesus====
{{main|Life-death-rebirth deity|Resurrection of Jesus|Easter|Resurrection appearances of Jesus}}
Christians regard the resurrection of Jesus as the central doctrine in Christianity. Others take the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation of Jesus]] to be more central; however, it is the [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]]&amp;nbsp;– and particularly his resurrection&amp;nbsp;– which provide validation of his incarnation. According to Paul, the entire Christian faith hinges upon the centrality of the resurrection of Jesus and the hope for a life after death. The [[Apostle Paul]] wrote in his first letter to the Corinthians:
{{quote|
If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men. But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:19-20|49}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Resurrection miracles====
[[File:Bonnat01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The Resurrection of Lazarus'', painting by [[Leon Bonnat]], France, 1857.]]
{{Main|Miracles of Jesus#Resurrection of the dead}}
During the [[Ministry of Jesus]] on earth, before his death, Jesus commissioned his [[Twelve Apostles]] to, among other things, raise the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Not in the [[Great Commission]] of the resurrected Jesus, but only in the so-called [[Matthew 10|''Lesser Commission'']] of Matthew, specifically {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], Jesus is said to have raised several persons from death. These resurrections included the daughter of [[Jairus]] shortly after death, a young man in the midst of his own [[funeral]] procession, and [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], who had been buried for four days. According to the [[Gospel of Matthew]], after Jesus's resurrection, many of those previously dead came out of their tombs and entered [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]], where they appeared to many.

Similar resurrections are credited to the [[twelve apostles|apostles]] and Catholic saints. In the [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Saint Peter]] raised a woman named [[Dorcas]] (also called Tabitha), and [[Paul the Apostle]] revived a man named [[Eutychus]] who had fallen asleep and fell from a window to his death. Following the [[Apostolic Age]], many saints were said to resurrect the dead, as recorded in [[Orthodox Christian]] hagiographies.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} [[St Columba]] supposedly raised a boy from the dead in the land of Picts.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Christians understand these miraculous resurrections to be of a different nature than the resurrection of Jesus and the future resurrection of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/don_stewart/stewart.cfm?id=136 |title=What's the Difference between Resurrection and Resuscitation? |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629200514/http://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/don_stewart/stewart.cfm?id=136 |archive-date=June 29, 2013 |dead-url=yes |access-date=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raising of Lazarus and others from the dead could also be called "resuscitations" or "reanimations", since the life given to them is presumably temporary in nature. In contrast, the resurrection of Jesus and the future resurrection of the dead has abolished death once and for all (see {{bibleverse||Isaiah|25:8|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:26|31}}, {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|1:10|31}}, {{bibleverse||Revelation|21:4|31}}).

====Resurrection of the dead====
{{main|Resurrection of the dead#Views in Christianity|Christian eschatology#Resurrection of the dead}}
Christianity started as a religious movement within 1st-century Judaism (late [[Second Temple Judaism]]), and it retains what the New Testament itself claims was the [[Pharisaic]] belief in the [[Pharisees#The afterlife|afterlife and Resurrection of the Dead]]. Whereas this belief was only one of many beliefs held about the [[World to Come]] in Second Temple Judaism, and was notably rejected by both the [[Sadducees]] and, according to [[Josephus]], the [[Pharisees]], this belief became dominant within [[Early Christianity]] and already in the Gospels of Luke and John included an insistence on the resurrection of the flesh. Most modern [[Christian churches]] continue to uphold the belief that there will be a final [[resurrection of the dead#Christianity|resurrection of the dead]] and [[World to Come#Christian eschatology|World to Come]], perhaps as prophesied by the Apostle Paul when he said: "...he hath appointed a day, in the which he will [[Last judgment|judge the world]]..." ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2017:30-31;&amp;version=NASB Acts 17:31] KJV) and "...there shall be a resurrection of the dead, [[Universal resurrection|both of the just and unjust]]." ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2024:14-16;&amp;version=NASB Acts 24:15] KJV).

Belief in the resurrection of the dead, and Jesus' role as judge, is codified in the [[Apostles' Creed]], which is the fundamental creed of Christian [[baptismal]] faith. The [[Book of Revelation]] also makes many references about the [[Judgment Day|Day of Judgment]] when the dead will be raised.

====Difference from Platonic philosophy====
In Platonic philosophy and other Greek philosophical thought, at death the soul was said to leave the inferior body behind. The idea that Jesus was resurrected spiritually rather than physically even gained popularity among some Christian teachers, whom the author of [[1 John]] declared to be [[antichrist]]s. Similar beliefs appeared in the early church as [[Gnosticism]]. However, in Luke 24:39, the resurrected Jesus expressly states "behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have."

=== Hinduism ===
There are folklore, stories, and extractions from certain holy texts that refer to resurrections. One major folklore is that of Savitri saving her husband's life from Yamraj. In the Ramayana, after Ravana was slayed by Rama in a great battle between good and evil, Rama requests the king of Gods, Indra, to restore the lives of all the monkeys who died in the great battle.

===Islam===
{{Main|Qiyama}}
Belief in the "Day of Resurrection", ''[[Qiyamah|Yawm al-Qiyāmah]]'' ({{lang-ar|يوم القيامة}}) is also crucial for Muslims. They believe the time of ''Qiyāmah'' is preordained by God but unknown to man. The trials and [[tribulation]]s preceding and during the ''Qiyāmah'' are described in the Qur'an and the [[hadith]], and also in the commentaries of [[Ulema|scholars]]. The Qur'an emphasizes [[Resurrection of the Dead|bodily resurrection]], a break from the [[pre-Islamic Arabia]]n understanding of death.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* "Resurrection", ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'' (2003)
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Avicenna | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | ref=harv }}: Ibn Sīnā, Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAbd Allāh b. Sīnā is known in the West as "Avicenna".

===Zen Buddhism===
There are stories in [[Buddhism]] where the power of resurrection was allegedly demonstrated in Chan or [[Zen]] tradition. One is the [[legend]] of [[Bodhidharma]], the Indian master who brought the [[Ekayana]] school of India to China that subsequently became Chan Buddhism.

The other is the passing of Chinese Chan master [[Fuke Zen|Puhua]] (J., Fuke) and is recounted in the Record of [[Linji Yixuan|Linji]] (J., [[Rinzai]]). Puhua was known for his unusual behavior and teaching style so it is no wonder that he is associated with an event that breaks the usual prohibition on displaying such powers. Here is the account from Irmgard Schloegl's "The Zen Teaching of Rinzai".

{{quote|
"One day at the street market Fuke was begging all and sundry to give him a robe. Everybody offered him one, but he did not want any of them. The master [Linji] made the superior buy a coffin, and when Fuke returned, said to him: "There, I had this robe made for you." Fuke shouldered the coffin, and went back to the street market, calling loudly: "Rinzai had this robe made for me! I am off to the East Gate to enter transformation" (to die)." The people of the market crowded after him, eager to look. Fuke said: "No, not today. Tomorrow, I shall go to the South Gate to enter transformation." And so for three days. Nobody believed it any longer. On the fourth day, and now without any spectators, Fuke went alone outside the city walls, and laid himself into the coffin. He asked a traveler who chanced by to nail down the lid.

The news spread at once, and the people of the market rushed there. On opening the coffin, they found that the body had vanished, but from high up in the sky they heard the ring of his hand bell."&lt;ref&gt;Schloegl, Irmgard; tr. "The Zen Teaching of Rinzai". Shambhala Publications, Inc., Berkeley, 1976. Page 76. {{ISBN|0-87773-087-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Whether sufficient brain information still exists for cryonics to successfully preserve may be intrinsically unprovable by present knowledge. Therefore, most proponents of cryonics see it as an intervention with prospects for success that vary widely depending on circumstances.

[[Russian cosmism|Russian Cosmist]] [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov]] advocated resurrection of the dead using scientific methods. Fedorov tried to plan specific actions for scientific research of the possibility of restoring life and making it infinite. His first project is connected with collecting and synthesizing decayed remains of dead based on "knowledge and control over all atoms and molecules of the world". The second method described by Fedorov is genetic-hereditary. The revival could be done successively in the ancestral line: sons and daughters restore their fathers and mothers, they in turn restore their parents and so on. This means restoring the ancestors using the hereditary information that they passed on to their children. Using this genetic method it is only possible to create a [[identical twin|genetic twin]] of the dead person. It is necessary to give back the revived person his old mind, his personality. Fedorov speculates about the idea of "radial images" that may contain the personalities of the people and survive after death. Nevertheless, Fedorov noted that even if a soul is destroyed after death, Man will learn to restore it whole by mastering the forces of decay and fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolai Berdyaev, The Religion of Resusciative Resurrection. "The Philosophy of the Common Task of N. F. Fedorov.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1994 book ''The Physics of Immortality'', American [[physicist]] [[Frank J. Tipler]], an expert on the [[general theory of relativity]],  presented his [[Omega Point (Tipler)|Omega Point Theory]] which outlines how a resurrection of the dead could take place at the end of the [[cosmos]].  He posits that humans will evolve into [[robots]] which will turn the entire [[cosmos]] into a [[supercomputer]] which will, shortly before the [[big crunch]], perform the resurrection within its [[cyberspace]], reconstructing formerly dead humans (from information captured by the [[supercomputer]] from the past [[light cone]] of the cosmos) as [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] within its [[metaverse]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank J.

Italian [[physicist]] and [[computer scientist]] [[Giulio Prisco]] presents the idea of "quantum archaeology",  "reconstructing the life, thoughts, memories, and feelings of any person in the past, up to any desired level of detail, and thus resurrecting the original person via 'copying to the future'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] | title=Technological Resurrection Concepts From Fedorov to Quantum Archeology | url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/prisco20151011 | access-date=December 10, 2015 | date=October 11, 2015 |author= Giulio Prisco}} {{cite web|url=http://giulioprisco.blogspot.fr/2011/12/quantum-archaeology.html|title=Quantum Archaeology |author=Giulio Prisco | accessdate=6 July 2015 | date=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Mind Children'', [[roboticist]] [[Hans Moravec]] proposed that a future [[supercomputer]] might be able to resurrect long-dead minds from the information that still survived. For example, this information can be in the form of memories, filmstrips, medical records, and [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=56mb7XuSx3QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Mind Children|accessdate=6 July 2015|isbn=9780674576186|last1=Moravec|first1=Hans|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futurisms.thenewatlantis.com/2010/02/resurrecting-dead.html|title=Resurrecting the Dead - Futurisms - The New Atlantis|work=Futurisms - The New Atlantis|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ray Kurzweil]], American inventor and [[futurist]], believes that when his concept of [[Technological singularity|singularity]] comes to pass, it will be possible to resurrect the dead by digital recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singularityweblog.com/ray-kurzweil-singularity/|title=Ray Kurzweil on the Singularity and Bringing Back the Dead|author=Socrates|date=18 July 2012|work=Singularity Weblog|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their [[science fiction]] [[novel]] ''[[The Light of Other Days]]'', [[Arthur C. Clarke|Sir Arthur Clarke]] and [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] imagine a future civilization resurrecting the dead of past ages by reaching into the past, through micro [[wormholes]] and with [[Nanorobotics|nanorobots]], to download full snapshots of [[brain]] states and memories.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Clarke, Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible, Millennium [i.e., Second] Edition, Victor Gollancz – An imprint of Orion Books Ltd., 1999, p. 118: "the novel that Stephen Baxter has now written from my synopsis — The Light of Other Days."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zombies==
{{Main|Zombie}}
A zombie ([[Haitian French]]: ''{{lang|fr|zombi}}'', {{lang-ht|zonbi}}) is a fictional [[undead]] being created through the reanimation of a human [[corpse]]. Zombies are most commonly found in [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[fantasy]] genre works. The term comes from [[Culture of Haiti#Folklore and mythology|Haitian folklore]], where a ''zombie'' is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]].

==Disappearances (as distinct from resurrection)==
{{See also|Entering heaven alive}}
As knowledge of different religions has grown, so have claims of bodily disappearance of some religious and mythological figures. In [[ancient Greek religion]], this was a way the gods made some physically immortal, including such figures as [[Cleitus (mythology)|Cleitus]], [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], [[Menelaus]], and [[Tithonus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Rohde]] ''Psyche: The Cult of Souls and Belief in Immortality among the Greeks''. New York: Harper &amp; Row 1966.[1921]&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, [[Cycnus]] was changed into a [[swan]] and vanished. In his chapter on [[Romulus]] from [[Parallel Lives]], [[Plutarch]] criticises the continuous belief in such disappearances, referring to the allegedly miraculous disappearance of the historical figures Romulus, [[Cleomedes of Astypalaea]], and [[Croesus]]. In ancient times, Greek and Roman pagan similarities were explained by the early Christian writers, such as [[Justin Martyr]], as the work of demons, with the intention of leading Christians astray.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martyr, ''Dialogue with Trypho'' (ca 147-161 A.D.) Catholic University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Epic of King Gesar]], Geesar, at the end, chants on a mountain top and his clothes fall empty to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandra David-Neel]],and Lama Yongden, ''The Superhuman Life of Gesar of Ling'', Rider, 1933, While still in oral tradition, it is recorded for the first time by an early European traveler.&lt;/ref&gt; The body of the first Guru of the [[Sikh]]s, [[Guru Nanak Dev]], is said to have disappeared and flowers left in place of his dead body.{{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]'s [[The Hero Pattern|Hero Pattern]] lists many religious figures whose bodies disappear, or have more than one [[sepulchre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Rank]], [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]], and [[Alan Dundes]], ''In Quest of the Hero'', Princeton University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; B. Traven, author of ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'', wrote that the [[Inca]] [[Virococha]] arrived at Cusco (in modern-day Peru) and the Pacific seacoast where he walked across the water and vanished.&lt;ref&gt;B. Traven, ''The Creation of the Sun and Moon'', Lawerence Hill Books, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; It has been thought that teachings regarding the purity and incorruptibility of the hero's human body are linked to this phenomenon. Perhaps, this is also to deter the practice of disturbing and collecting the hero's remains. They are safely protected if they have disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;See: Michael Paterniti, ''Driving Mr. Albert: A Trip Across America with Einstein's Brain'', The Dial Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such case mentioned in the Bible is that of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] (son of [[Jared (ancestor of Noah)|Jared]], great-grandfather of [[Noah]], and father of [[Methuselah]]). Enoch is said to have lived a life where he "walked with God", after which "he was not, for God took him" (Genesis 5:1–18).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Genesis|5:18-24|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Deuteronomy]] (34:6) [[Moses]] is secretly buried. [[Elijah]] vanishes in a whirlwind [[2 Kings]] (2:11). After hundreds of years these two earlier Biblical heroes suddenly reappear, and are seen walking with Jesus, then again vanish. [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] (9:2–8), [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] (17:1–8) and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (9:28–33). The last time he is seen, [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (24:51) alone tells of Jesus leaving his disciples by [[Ascension of Jesus|ascending into the sky]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2066">'''Sadd colors''' or '''sad colors''' were the colors of choice for the clothing of the members of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in seventeenth century America ("sadd"/ "sad" carried the meaning of "seriousness" rather than "sadness"). The [[Puritan]]s have often been depicted wearing simple black and white, but for them, the color "black" was itself considered too bold for regular use and was reserved for community elders and for highly formal occasions such as when having one's portrait painted.  Black was considered so formal in part because black dye was difficult to obtain and black clothing had a tendency to fade to other colors rather quickly.  The Puritans, then, designated a set of colors which they called "sadd" colors for their everyday use.  These colors were deliberately subdued, and included such named colors as [[Liver (color)|liver color]], de Boys (the color of "the wood", from ''du bois'' in French), [[tawny (color)|tawney]], [[Russet (color)|russet]], [[rust (color)|rust]], purple, French green (a very pale shade of gray-green), ginger lyne, deer color, orange, gridolin (from the French ''gris de lin'', "flax blossom", a color resembling [[Littorinidae|periwinkle]]), [[puce]], folding color, Kendall green (a dark variety of French green), Lincoln green (a more vivid shade of green akin to [[forest green]]), barry, milly, tuly, and philly mort (from the French words ''feuille morte'', "dead leaf", a dark gray-brown).&lt;ref name="Fischer1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Hackett Fischer|title=Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWDugJTHHAwC&amp;pg=PP100|date=14 March 1991|publisher=Oxford University |isbn=978-0-19-974369-8|pages=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=John A.

[[File:Parral Samay Huasi.jpg|thumb|Vineyard]]
'''Samay Huasi''' (from [[Quechua language|Quechua]] ''Samay Wasi'', ''samay'' rest, to rest, ''wasi'' house,&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt; "rest house") is a historic property in [[Argentina]] functioning as both a vacation retreat, as well as a museum.

==Overview==
Located in [[Chilecito]], a town located high in the [[Sierras pampeanas|Pampas Sierras]] of [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja Province]], the property originally belonged to William Treloar, a [[British Empire|British]] [[mining engineer]] who purchased it as a retirement property in the late 19th century. His earlier profession had acquainted him with Dr. [[Joaquín V. González]], who was one of the nation's most prominent Mining Law attorneys, and had been Governor of La Rioja from 1889 to 1891. Treloar bequeathed ''La Carrera'', his scenic [[estancia|finca]], to his friend, and González inherited the {{convert|17|ha|acre|abbr=off}} property in 1913.

The new owner kept Treloar's [[vineyard]]s and [[orchard]]s, expanded the living quarters, converted the [[horse stable]]s into ten bedrooms for each of his sons, and renamed the finca ''Samay Huasi''. González, who served as President of the [[University of La Plata]] from 1905 to 1913, in turn willed Samay Huasi to the university, and died in 1923.

The University of La Plata formally took possession of Samay Huasi in 1941, and originally maintained it as the ''Casa de Descanso para Artistas y Escritores'', a vacation lodge for artists and writers; the lodge was later reserved of university staff. A portion was set aside in 1960 for the establishment of a museum displaying González's collections of [[anthropological]] and [[geological]] material, as well as his numerous manuscripts (he published over 50 books and 1,000 articles), and other belongings. The museum was named ''Mis Montañas'' in honor of González's 1903 book describing the nearby [[Talampaya]] area and other [[Andes]] landscapes.

Samay Huasi also houses an [[art gallery]], the Antonio Alice [[Pinacotheca]]. Named for [[Antonio Alice]], an Argentine [[portrait painting|portraiteur]] and [[History painting|historical painter]] who (among many other works) had created a portrait of González in 1917, the gallery displays art from a variety of [[Culture of Argentina#Painting and sculpture|Argentine painters]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2062">'''Sepik Coast exchange''' is the method of social networking and alliance in the Sepik Coast area of [[Papua New Guinea]].

Families living along the Sepik Coast in northern [[Papua New Guinea]] form alliances with families in other communities.  Depending on the importance and status of the family, it can have anywhere between 5 and 75 contacts in its social network.  In each surrounding town, the family knows another.  When they travel to another town, they bring gifts to their contact family, and that family will house and care for them.  Gifts are reciprocated when given or later when families return the visit.  Common gifts are [[sago]], [[tobacco]], baskets, wooden bowls, and other similar items.  The recipient does not specify which type of gift they would like to receive, but as a result of the vast quantity of exchanges taking place, the needs of participants are generally met.

A social field is one in which all the members have similar expectations of each other.  In the social networks of the Sepik Coast, the significant expectations are hospitality, gift giving and reciprocation from friends in different villages. Alliances are passed along and preserved through many generations, because fathers bring their sons on their trips and families honor an association, no matter how long it has been since the last gift exchange.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3935">{{About|the metaphor|the short story by Edgar Allan Poe|The Imp of the Perverse (short story) }}

'''The Imp of the Perverse''' is a [[metaphor]] for the urge to do exactly the wrong thing in a given situation for the sole reason that it is possible for wrong to be done.  The impulse is compared to an [[imp]] (a small [[demon]]) which leads an otherwise decent person into mischief.

==Poe’s short stories==
The phrase has a long history in [[literature]], and was popularized (and perhaps coined) by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] in his short story, "[[The Imp of the Perverse (short story)|The Imp of the Perverse]]".

{{quote|We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that it will be ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action. ... It must, it shall be undertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow, and why?

Poe explores this impulse through several of his fictional characters, the narrators in "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]"&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey.

==Other appearances==
* The Imp of the Perverse is also exemplified in "Le Mauvais Vitrier" ("The Bad Glazier"), a prose poem by [[Charles Baudelaire]].
* The concept also figures prominently in the motives of [[Jack Shaftoe]], a [[swashbuckling]] protagonist in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s trilogy ''[[The Baroque Cycle]]'':

{{Quote|But here was a rare opportunity for stupidity even more flagrant and glorious.

Now, Bob, who'd been observing Jack carefully for many years, had observed that when these moments arrived, Jack was almost invariably possessed by something that Bob had heard about in Church called the Imp of the Perverse.  Bob was convinced that the Imp of the Perverse rode invisibly on Jack's shoulder whispering bad ideas into his ear, and that the only counterbalance was Bob himself, standing alongsides counseling good sense, prudence, caution, and other Puritan virtues.

But Bob was in England.|from ''[[Quicksilver (novel)|Quicksilver]]''}}

* [[Eric Berne]] saw what he called the "demon" in the self as the (vocalisation of) a primitive [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]] impulse, citing the instance of a stockbroker who at the key moment "heard a demonic whisper telling him: 'Don't sell, buy'. He abandoned his carefully planned campaign, and lost his entire capital - 'Ha, ha,' he said".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 135 and p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Selaginella involens katahiba01.jpg|290px|thumb|''Off [[moss|fog]] and [[fern|farne]] full febilie wes maid...'' (line 198)]]

"'''The Taill of the Uponlandis Mous and the Burges Mous'''", also known as "'''The Twa Mice''',"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/CAMELOT/teams/mf13fr.htm The Morall Fabillis - The Paddock and the Mouse]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Middle Scots]] adaptation of [[Aesop]]'s [[Aesop's Fables|Fable]] ''[[The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse]]'' by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] poet [[Robert Henryson]]. Written around the 1480s, it is the second poem in Henryson's collection called ''[[The Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian]]''. 

Hennryson's ''Fabill'' treats its characters and incidents with a realism that was hitherto unusual in the genre. Its ambiguous portrayal of the two protagonists seamlessly blends their animal and human characteristics in a way that allowed the [[makar]] to satirise new social classes in the rising ''[[Royal burgh#Origins|burous touns]]'' of his day with subtle and philosophical irony.

==Plot==

The original fable plot is very simple. A town mouse visits a country cousin and is unimpressed at the poor quality of the fare. The town mouse invites the cousin back to her town house where the feasting is better. In town it is true that the food is better, more plentiful and very readily available, but the creatures are twice interrupted by inhabitants of the house. The country mouse does not stay to experience a third upset but returns home where the simple food can be enjoyed in peace. 

Henryson's ''second fabill'' is highly faithful to Aesop's basic structure. His expansion creates fully fleshed [[Scene (fiction)|scene]]s from each of the elements and heightens the drama in a number of different ways while remaining essentially concise.

''[[Mouse|Mous]]'' in Scots is pronounced with a short "oo" vowel, and Henryson's 15th-century spelling of the plural is ''myis.'

==Fabill==

Henryson's fabill describes the two mice as ''[[sister]]is'' and presents the difference in their lifestyles using human and economic terms that lend them ambiguous overtones. The Uponlandis Mous survives with difficulty like an ''[[Exile|owtlaw]]'' living on ''uther mennis [[Manual labour|skaith]]'' (''[[Literal and figurative language#Literal Language|lit.]]'' harm, in the sense of toil, suggesting the corn planted by farmers) and going hungry in winter. By contrast, the Burges Mous in town has it easy and lives a privileged life like a ''[[Guild|gild brother]]'' able to move freely all year ''but custum mair or les'' (''i.e.'' without paying tax) ''among the cheis in [[box|ark]] and meill in [[chest (furniture)|kist]]''. It is worth noting that just as Henryson blurs animal and human characteristics he also blurs the [[gender]] of the mice. 

[[File:Boschverloren.png|right|290px|thumb|[[Hieronymus Bosch]], ''"The wayfarer."'']]

The taill features pictures of the mice travelling outside the city. When the Burges Mous decides to look for her sister, she sets out ''[[barefoot|barefute]], allone, with pykestaf in hir hand/ as [[humility|pure]] [[pilgrim|pylgryme]]'', and the image is of a lost figure in rugged terrain of uncertain vastness. Their journey back to town even has unlawful overtones (though quite natural for a mouse) as the pair sleep by day and move by night as if in violation of a [[curfew]]. 

The fabill has two main scenes. The first is set in the ''sober [[dwelling|wane]]'' of the Uponlandis Mous, described as a frail dwelling of moss and fern set under a ''[[wikt:secure|steidfast]] stane.'' It features some highly believable dialogue as the two sisters fall out over the quality of the hospitality and is only eight stanzas long. 

The second scene, with equally swiftly described action, takes place in a spence ''with vittell grit plentie'' (a well-stocked pantry) in a town house described as being ''not fer fra thyne'' (''[[Literal and figurative language#Literal Language|lit.]]'' not far from your place). The first figure to interrupt their [[banquet|feast]] is the [[larder#History|spencer]]. Henryson departs from Aesop's original by allowing only the Burges Mous a hole in which to escape. Her sister, finding nowhere to go, lies ''flatlings'' on the ground in terror. 

Visitation number two is a much more frightening development for the mice. After the spencer passes, the Burges  persuades her reluctant sister to return to the [[table (furniture)|burde]], but 

:''scantlie had thay drunkin [[Wiktionary:once|anis]] or twyse 
:''Quhen in come Gib Hunter, oure jolie cat...'' 
(lines 325-6) 

This time the Uponlandis Mous is lucky to escape with her life. After much cruel handling from the cat, she manages to win free only by climbing up between ''ane [[tapestry|parraling]]'' and the wall. After the cat has gone, the mous decries her sister's lifestyle and returns home.  

:''Quhen scho wes furth and [[Liberty|fre]], scho wes [[contentment|ful fane]],''
:''And merilie [[marching|markit]] unto the [[moorland|mure]].'' 
(Lines 355-6)

The fabill has a happy ending, but is qualified. The narrator reports in the final stanza only the [[rumour]] he has heard that the Uponlandis Mous lived happily ever after.

==Moralitas==
[[File:Cat tongue macro.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Gib Hunter]]

The second moralitas in the cycle is a short, beautifully composed [[paean]] to the virtues of [[self-sufficiency]] and [[self-control]] summed up in the line, ''Quha hes [[wikt:enough|aneuch]], of na mair hes he neid,'' a philosophy commonly expressed in many religions and cultures, most especially [[Daoism]]. The moralitas is one of the most straightforward and self-contained in Henryson's ''Morall Fabillis'' and is manifestly in harmony with the preceding taill (not always the case elsewhere). 

Henryson to some degree highlights the second moralitas as standing a little apart from the rest of the poem by composing its four stanzas in [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]] form (the first of only two brief departures from [[rhyme royal]] in the cycle overall) while nevertheless simultaneously underlining the close link to the story by using a chain of rhyme that runs from the end of the taill into the beginning of the moralitas. Despite employing conventional [[Morality#Moral codes|moral]] expressions and warnings, the ultimate effect is surprisingly moving. 

The first word addresses the audience in intimate and familiar terms as ''[[friend]]is'' (pronounced in Scots with a short "ee" vowel).

==''Meit''==

''The Uponlandis Mous and the Burges Mous'' contains several references to ''meit'' (food) eaten by the mice. Comparisons of the bill of fare between the two locales (town and country) reveal differences. 

The simple (generally unprocessed) foods associated with the rural existence are: 

*''[[wheat|corne]]'' 
*''[[cereal|quheit]]'' 
*''[[rye|ry]]''
*''[[nut (fruit)|nuttis]]''
*''[[pea|peis]]'', 
*''[[kale|watter caill]]'' (as [[soup]])
*''[[bean|benis]]''

This list ends with ''[[candle|candill]] insteid of [[spice trade|spyce]]'' (perhaps also involving a pun with Scots ''[[cinnamon|cannel]]''). 

The foods associated with the urban setting, on the other hand, are effectively household produce: 

[[File:Hunterian Psalter c. 1170 feasting.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Feasting]]

*''[[cheese|cheis]]''
*''[[butter]]''
*''[[meat|flesche]]''
*''[[seafood|fische]] baith [[Produce|fresche]] and [[Salted fish|salt]]''
*''[[oat|grotis]]''
*''[[flour|meill]]''
*''[[malt]]'' 
*''[[mutton|muttoun]]''
*''[[beef|beif]]''
*''[[oatcake|thraff caikkis]]''
*''[[white bread|mane full fyne]] insteid of [[Gelatin|geill]]'' 

Once again, the list is completed with ''[[wax|quhyte candill]] to gust thair mouth withall''. 

The Uponlandis Mous refers to ''the [[Boiling#Boiling in cookery|seithing]] of ane [[ox|kow]]'' (pronounced ''coo'') (line 235) as an illustration of excess, while the Burges Mous rather [[Wiktionary:bold|gallus]]ly invokes Christian dietary codes when she boasts, ''My [[Good Friday#In the Roman Catholic Church|Gude Friday]] is better nor your [[Easter#Position in the church year|Pace]]'' (line 248). The Uponlandis Mous ultimately complains of the urban fare, ''Thy [[goose|guse]] is gude, thy [[sauce|gansell]] sour as [[bile|gall]]'' (line 345) and the narrator in the moralitas refers to ''[[weed|fitches]]'' and ''[[seed|seid]]'' (line 367). 

One point of equivalence in dietary matters between the two scenes is the reference in both to candlewax as the [[condiment]] the mice use (instead of spice) to add gust or "flavour" to their meals, while on the matter of drink, Henryson makes a special point that the mice ''drink the [[Drinking water|watter cleir]]/ insteid of [[wine|wyne]]'' (lines 272-3).

==Numbers==
The fabill is a taill of 29 stanzas with a moralitas of 4 stanzas. 

* 29 + 4 = 33

The last stanza of the taill is an endnote to the action giving the narrator's conclusion. This produces a division: 

* 28 + 1 = 29

If the point at which the mice pass in company from country to town is taken as the fundamental point of division between the two scenes in the taill, then the action can be further divided: 

* 14 + 15 = 29

The first major turning point in the action (the Uponlandis Mousis sudden consent to follow her sister back to town) occurs in the last line of stanza 13.

==Extract==

{{-}}
When the ''Burges Mous'' ventures forth to seek her rural cousin beyond the confines of city, the picture of her as a figure in a landscape (created in a very few words) produces a highly ambiguous sense of scale: 

:''Furth mony [[wilderness|wilsum]] wayis can scho walk:
:''Throw [[wetland|mosse]] and [[moorland|mure]], throw [[Levee|bank]]is, [[scrubland|busk]] and [[hedge (barrier)|breir]], 
:''Fra [[Ridge and furrow|fur]] to fur, cryand fra [[Ridge and furrow|balk]] to balk: 
:''"Cum furth to me, my awin sister deir, 
:''Cry peip [[Wiktionary:yince|anis]]!"...''

"'''When the going gets tough, the tough get going'''" is a popular [[proverb]].meaning::

==Phrase==

The phrase is a play on words involving idiomatic (Proverb) and distinct meanings of "go" and "tough." In context, "the [[go (verb)|going]]" means "the situation," "gets tough" means "becomes difficult," "the tough" means "people who are strong or enduring," and "get going" means "become fully engaged." Taken together, the meaning of the phrase is "When the situation becomes difficult, the strong will become engaged."

The phrase is an example of [[antimetabole]].

Another interpretation could mean, "Those who act tough and proud will vacate a situation when it becomes difficult lest they be proven not as tough as they appear to be."

==Origin==

The origin of the phrase has been attributed both to [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] (1888–1969),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/get-going Answers.com - Proverbs: When the going gets tough, the tough get going]&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=April 2017}} father of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], and sometimes to Norwegian-born American football player and coach [[Knute Rockne]] (1888–1931).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englishclub.com/ref/esl/Sayings/Quizzes/Modern/When_the_going_gets_tough_the_tough_get_going_1314.htm English Club - When the going gets tough, the tough get  going ]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is used as a management motivational talk and is popular in many self-help books. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Idioms - When the going gets tough, the tough get going|url=http://www.theidioms.com/when-the-going-gets-tough-the-tough-get-going}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=August 2015}}
A '''working language''' (also '''procedural language''') is a [[language]] that is given a unique legal status in a [[supranational law|supranational]] company, society, state or other body or organization as its primary means of communication. It is primarily the language of the daily correspondence and conversation, since the organization usually has members with various differing language backgrounds.

Most international organizations have working languages for their bodies. For a given organization, a working language may or may not also be an [[official language]].{{cfy|reason=why is working language not official language?|date=March 2016}}

==United Nations working languages==
Originally [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] were established as working languages at the UN. Later, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] were added as working languages in the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and in the Economic and Social Council. Currently, Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish are the working languages of the [[Security Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/aboutun/languages.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826011927/http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/languages.shtml |date=August 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of common international organizations ==

===English and French===
The [[International Criminal Court]]&lt;ref name=icc&gt;[http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm Article 50] of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]]. Accessed 16 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  has two working languages:  [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]; all [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretaries-General]] of the UN, therefore, {{cns|text=are required ({{cfy|reason=oxymoronic|text=unofficially|date=March 2016}}) to be fluent in both|date=March 2016}}. The [[Council of Europe]] and [[NATO]] also have English and French as their two working languages.

The [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] (WOSM) has [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] as official languages&lt;ref&gt;WOSM constitution, ARTICLE XXIV, 1&lt;/ref&gt;, with [[Arabic]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as additional working languages.&lt;ref&gt;SCOUTS brand manual PROFESSIONAL VERSION, page 49, retrieved from [https://www.scout.es/downloads/brand.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other groups with one or two working languages===
* The [[Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples Secretariat]] has English as its sole working language, though communications are also published in [[Russian language|Russian]]. Although many circumpolar indigenous people speak either an [[Inuit]] dialect, a variety of [[Sami languages|Saami]] or a [[Ural-Altaic languages|Ural-Altaic]] language, English is likely to be the second or third language that many of them will have in common.
* The [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] has two working languages: [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]].
* [[Mercosur]] has two working languages: [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and Spanish.
* The government of [[East Timor]] has Indonesian and English as working languages alongside its official languages (Tetun and Portuguese) and 15 other recognized local languages
* The state of [[Goa]] in [[India]] has [[Marathi language|Marathi]] as its working language, but only [[Konkani language|Konkani]] has official status in the state.
* English is the working language in [[ASEAN]].
* [[languages of Greenland|Greenland]] has demoted [[Danish language|Danish]] from a co-official language to a working language for pragmatic reasons, since spoken and written [[Danish people in Greenland|Danish remains dominant across several sectors of society]], such as health care and higher education.

===English, French and Spanish===
The [[World Trade Organization]], the [[International Telecommunications Union]], the [[International Maritime Organization]], the [[International Labour Organization]], [[NAFTA]] and the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] all have three working languages: English, French and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

===Other groups with three or more working languages===
* The [[European Commission]] has three working languages: English, French and [[German language|German]].
* [[FIFA]] has four working languages: English, French, German and Spanish. Formerly, French was the organization's sole official language. Currently, English is the official language for minutes, correspondence and announcements.
* The [[Languages of the African Union|African Union]] currently uses [[Arabic language|Arabic]], English, French, Portuguese, Spanish and [[Swahili language|Swahili]].
* The [[Southern African Development Community]] has four working languages: [[Afrikaans]], English, French and Portuguese.
