      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7625">'''Aaron ben Gershon Abu Al-Rabi''' of [[Catania]] (also '''Aaron ben Gershon Abualrabi''', '''Aaron Alrabi'''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Aronne Abulrabi'') was a [[History of the Jews in Sicily|Sicilian-Jewish]] scholar, cabalist, and astrologer of the 15th century.

==Life==
He was a son-in-law of Don Moses Gabbai, an exile from [[Majorca]]. Aaron was the youngest of five brothers, all rabbinic scholars; the others were Shallum, Baruch, Moses, and Isaac. He studied in [[Treviso]], [[Italy]], and was familiar with the scientific and philosophic literature of his age; he was a good grammarian, and well acquainted with the [[Arabic language]]. Like his father, he believed in astrology, and loved to observe the horoscope. He was also an adept in the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]], though at times his critical spirit came in conflict with its doctrines. On his travels he visited [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Damascus]], and [[Feodosiya#Caffa|Kaffa]] in the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]. In [[Jerusalem]] he had many disputations with the [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]], to which his commentary on the [[Pentateuch]] refers with evident pride, as having vindicated the cause of rabbinical theology. While in [[Rome]] he was admitted to the presence of [[Pope Martin V]], who was surrounded by his cardinals. Martin V was kindly disposed toward the [[Jews]], and often discussed religious questions with them in a friendly manner. On this occasion he propounded to Aaron a number of very pointed questions concerning Biblical and Talmudical passages. Among other things he asked if the use of the [[cherubim]] in the Holy of Holies was not rather antagonistic to the [[You shall not make for yourself an idol|Second Commandment]], which prohibits [[idolatry]]. Aaron in his commentary refers several times to this discussion and to the answers he gave.

==Writer==
Coming often in contact with learned Christians, Aaron had many occasions to defend Judaism against the polemics of the Church, on the one hand, and the attacks of the Karaites on the other. It was this unceasing conflict that induced him to write a book, called "Maṭṭeh Aharon" (The Staff of Aaron), in defense of the Law and tradition. Keenly observant, and of an independent and critical spirit, he judged persons and opinions freely and openly. He excels as a writer and as a Bible commentator, and often upbraids the Jews of his native land for their ignorance and hollow pretensions, at the same time pointing with admiration to the numerous Jews of high breeding he has met on his travels. Following the principle of a rational Biblical [[exegesis]], he does not hesitate occasionally to refute [[haggadic]] traditions which seem to conflict with reason and common sense; and at times, like [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] and [[Samuel ben Meir]], he even states his disagreement with [[halakic]] interpretation. He was fully conversant with the views of the Karaites and [[Samaritans]] and eager, in his explanation of the Bible, to refute now Christian and now [[Muslim]] doctrines. He boldly exposes errors wherever he finds them, claiming "that it is more honorable for the wise to commit an error than knowingly to misrepresent the truth."

Nor does he shrink from pointing out the blemishes he finds in the character of the Patriarchs. Being guided solely by a love of truth, he, as a matter of course, does not spare such great Bible commentators as [[Rashi]] and [[Nahmanides]]. For the former Aaron entertained a very high regard; of the latter he frequently says, "With due deference to his honor, he misunderstood the Talmud" (see his commentary upon Gen. xxvii. 22; Ex. xxiii. 11, xxv. 9). Like Samuel ben Meir and Maimonides, he explains the law, "Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk" (Ex. xxiii. 19), as a warning against a certain idolatrous practise. Notwithstanding his liberal mind and his keen investigating spirit, he was held in high esteem by his contemporaries, as may be seen from [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|David Abi Zimra's]] mention of him as "Aaron our Rabbi" in No. 10 of his responsa, where he commends him for his liberty of thought. He was a devoted Jew, who deeply deplored the political and social condition of the Jews of his time, and all the more fervently gave expression to his hope for the speedy advent of the Messiah. For his cabalistic views he quotes [[Recanate]] and [[Joseph Sar Shalom]], but not the [[Zohar]].

==Works==
Aaron states that he wrote a [[Hebrew grammar]] entitled "''Ha-Meyasher''" (''The Leveler of the Road''); "''Maṭṭeh Aharon''," referred to above, a cabalistic or metaphysical work; "''Nezer ha-Ḳodesh''" (''The Crown of Holiness''); "''Peraḥ ha-Elohut''" (''The Blossoming of the Godhead''), probably of a similar character, and "''Sefer ha-Nefesh''" (''The Book of the Soul''). All of these works are known only through his own quotations in his supercommentary on Rashi. This work, published from an incomplete manuscript, together with another supercommentary on Rashi by [[Samuel Almosnino]], by [[Moses Albelda]], and by [[Jacob Canizal]], is one of the earliest books printed at Constantinople, and is therefore very rare. According to his own testimony, it was written in 1420 (as Perles has shown); but he intended to compose, or, as Perles thinks, actually did compose, a larger commentary on the Pentateuch. Perles has furnished ample proof that Aaron Aldabi—or, as he called himself, Aaron Alrabi—was a man of great originality and merit, and it is to be hoped that his lost works will be discovered, and that editions of his commentary, based on clear manuscripts existing in Oxford and elsewhere, will fully vindicate his character, though Graetz and Karpeles, in their histories, have attacked him.

J. H. Schorr, in "Zion," 1840, first called attention to Abu al-Rabi, erroneously calling him Aaron ben Mose Alrabi; but, owing to a misunderstanding of his remarks, he ascribes to him the strange assertion that Moses translated the Pentateuch from the Arabic into Hebrew—a misunderstanding repeated by Grätz, "Gesch. d. Juden" (third edition), viii. 250, and by Karpeles, "Gesch. der Jüdischen Literatur," p.&amp;nbsp;771—whereas the author, in his commentary upon Gen. xviii. 5, referring to the rabbinical Haggadah that the angels who came to Abraham appeared as Arabs, says that they spoke in Arabic, and that Moses rendered their words in Hebrew—a remark which he repeats in his comments upon Gen. xxiv. 23 and Ex. ii. 10. Zunz, "Z. G.," pp.&amp;nbsp;518–520, and Steinschneider, "Cat. Bodl.," call him Alrabi. Aaron's true name, however, is given in the acrostic written by him at the end of his published commentary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1778">'''Abraham ben Mordecai Galante''' (died 1560) was an Italian [[kabbalist]] born in [[Rome]] at the beginning of the 16th century. Abraham, like his father [[Galante (pedigree)|Mordecai]] and his brother [[Moses Galante (the Elder)|Moses]] of [[Safed]], is represented by his contemporaries as a man of high character who led a holy life. Being wealthy, he erected a splendid mausoleum over the tomb of [[Simon ben Yoḥai]] at [[Meron, Israel|Meron]], which is still admired.

He was the author of the following works: 
*''Ḳin'at Setarim,'' a commentary on [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], based upon the [[Zohar]], edited by his son Samuel in the collection ''Ḳol Bokim'' (Venice, 1589)
*''Yeraḥ Yakar,'' a commentary on the Zohar, the first part of which ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]) was abbreviated by [[Abraham Azulai]] and included in his ''Zohore Ḥammah''
*''Zekut Abot,'' a commentary on the [[Sayings of the Fathers]], mentioned by [[Hananiah of Monselice]] in his commentary on the ''Pirḳe Shirah.'' Galante was also the author of [[halakic]] decisions, which are still extant in manuscript.

==History==
The first Church of England services in Bermuda were performed by the Reverend Richard Buck, one of the survivors of the 1609 wreck of the [[Sea Venture]] who began Bermuda's permanent settlement. Nine parishes, each with its own church and [[Glebe|glebe land]], were created when colonisation became official in 1612, but there was rarely more than a pair of ordained Ministers to share between them over the following two centuries. From 1625 to 1839, Bermuda was attached to the [[Diocese of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island|See of Nova Scotia]]. Bermuda then became part of the ''Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda'' from its creation in 1839 until 1919. In 1879, the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed and a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the [[Diocese of Newfoundland]], but continued to be grouped under the ''Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda'' until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own Bishop.

[[File:Hetan priest officiating at Garni Temple, Armenia 34.jpg|thumb|Arordiner priests officiating a ceremony at the [[Temple of Garni]].]]
The '''Armenian Native Faith''', also termed '''Armenian Neopaganism''' or '''Hetanism''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Հեթանոսութիւն ''Hetanosutiwn''; a [[cognate]] word of "[[Paganism#Heathen|Heathenism]]"), is a [[modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] [[new religious movement]] that harkens back to the [[Armenian mythology|historical, pre-Christian belief systems]] and [[ethnic religion]]s of the [[Armenians]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|pp=104–105}} The followers of the movement call themselves "Hetans" ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: հեթանոս ''Hetanos'', which means "Heathen", thus "ethnic", both of them being loanwords from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἔθνος'', ''ethnos''){{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105, note 4}} or ''Arordi'', meaning the "Children of Ari",{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105, note 4}} also rendered as "Arordiners" in some scholarly publications.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|loc=passim}}

The Arordiner movement has antecedents in the early 20th century, with the doctrine of ''[[Tseghakron]]'' (Ցեղակրօն, literally "national religion") of the philosopher and nationalist political theorist [[Garegin Nzhdeh]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} It took an institutional form in 1991, just after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in a climate of national reawakening, when the [[armenology|armenologist]] Slak Kakosyan founded the "Order of the Children of Ari" (''Arordineri Ukht'').{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}}

==History==
[[File:Garegin Nzhdeh 5.jpg|thumb|Garegin Nzhdeh, the ideologue of an Armenian "national religion".]]

===Nzhdeh's and Kakosyan's experiences===
The first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the "Order of the Children of Ari" (or "Ara"; ''Arordineri Ukht'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard, or Edik) Kakosyan (1936–2005).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]]; in 1979 he fled to the [[United States]] where he became familiar with the ideas of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] (1886–1955).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}}

Nzhdeh was a philosopher, statesman and ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of [[Armenia]], and is still one of the driving forces of [[Armenian nationalism]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} Kakosyan praised him as the "prophet of the Armenians".{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=266}} Nzhdeh founded a movement named ''[[Tseghakron]]'' ("religion of the nation"), which was among the core doctrines of the [[Armenian Youth Federation]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] upholding the ordered world,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} and it makes reference to [[Hayk]], the mythical patriarch of the [[Armenians]], and to [[Vahagn]], the solar and warrior god "[[Proto-Indo-European religion#Dragon or serpent|fighter of the serpent]]", as means through which to awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}}

During his exile, Slak Kakosyan made extensive use of Nzhdeh's works to codify the ''Ukhtagirk'' ("Book of Vows"), the sacred text of the Armenian Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}} In the book, Garegin Nzhdeh is [[apotheosis|deified]] as an incarnation of Vahagn, the re-establisher of the true faith of the Armenians and of the [[Aryan]] values.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}} While still in the United States, Kakosyan claimed that he had been initiated to the ancient Armenian hereditary priesthood mentioned by [[Moses of Chorene]], changing his forename from "Edik" to "Slak".{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}} He likely became acquainted with [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] communities in the United States.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}}

===1990s: Establishment of the Children of Ari===
Returning to Armenia in 1991, Slak Kakosyan gathered a community and founded the Children of Ari. They began to hold rituals on traditional Armenian holydays. The [[Temple of Garni]] became the centre of the community, a council of priests was set up in order to manage the organisation and the rites.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106, note 7}} During the 1990s, the group reached visibility in wider Armenian society.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} According to the scholar Yulia Antonyan, the emergence of the Armenian Native Faith is attributable to the same causes which led to the rise of other modern Pagan movements, but also [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movements, in the other post-Soviet countries: The Armenian Native Faith represents the indigenous answer to the social and cultural upheavals which followed the collapse of Soviet society and of its atheist and materialist ideology.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=104}}

===Republican Party support and grassroots spread===
[[File:Hetan priest officiating at Garni Temple, Armenia 13.jpg|thumb|An Arordiner priest.]]
[[Ashot Navasardyan]] (1950–1997) and [[Andranik Margaryan]] (1949–2007), founding fathers of the [[Republican Party of Armenia]], were Arordiners like many other members of the party and took part in the very first ritual at the Temple of Garni.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=270}} The Republican Party provided financial support for the Children of Ari until recent times,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} sponsored the publication of ''Ukhtagirk''{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=270}} and the set up of a memorial stele to Slak Kakosyan on the grounds of the Temple of Garni.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107, note 8}} Arordiner festivals are celebrated in some regions with the support of local municipalities.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107, note 8}} Despite this strong link with the nationalist political scene, the Children of Ari does not declare a political orientation, and the priests are forbidden from joining any political party.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}}

Although it started among the Armenian intellectual elites as a means to reawaken Armenian identity, in most recent times the Armenian Native Faith movement has expanded its contingent of adherents among the provincial and rural populations,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} and among the [[Armenian diaspora]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} Besides the philosophical approach of the intellectuals, the common people are driven to the Armenian Native Faith by various reasons, ranging from [[mysticism]] to a sentimental devotion to the gods. Antonyan documented the case of a thirty-five years-old woman who believed to be [[infertility|infertile]], and who joined the Armenian Native Faith movement after she allegedly became pregnant by praying to Anahit, goddess of fertility, and to Astghik, goddess of love and beauty.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} The woman gave her daughter the name "Nana", another name of the goddess of fertility.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}}

Local Arordiner communities have been organised in villages outside the capital [[Yerevan]]. The structure of the Order of the Children of Ari, and of the local communities themselves, is characterised by a clear hierarchy, with the council of priests, led by an elected chief, handling the organisation of all activities. The highest position within the hierarchy is that of the supreme priest, which has remained vacant since Slak Kakosyan's death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=267–268}}

===2009: Avetisyan and the Armenian Aryan Order===
Another party that was closely associated to the Arordiners is the Union of Armenian Aryans, led by Armen Avetisyan, headquartered in [[Abovyan]], a city which is the second most important center of the Armenian Native Faith movement after Yerevan.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107, note 12}} The relations with the party, known for its extreme views, were cut in 2009 when Avetisyan proclaimed himself a spiritual leader and announced the initiative to build a central temple in Yerevan; as the Children of Ari expressed their opposition to the project, Avetisyan founded a separate religious group, the Armenian Aryan Order.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=270}}

==Beliefs==
===Theology and cosmology===
====Ar and Ara====
Beliefs among the individual Arordiners vary,{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} though there is a common theological underpinning provided by ''Ukhtagirk''. This theology is a [[monism]]: The beginning of the first section of the book recites that "in the beginning was the Ar, and Ara was the creator".{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} The Ar is the impersonal, without qualities, [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] principle begetting the universe, while Ara is his personal, present form as "the Creator".{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} The book continues telling the myth of how Ara generates the gods{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} and how the goddess [[Anahit]] gives birth to Ari ([[Aryan]]), the form of mankind.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} According to Arordiner theology, ''Ar'' is the life-giving word root,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} and it is the origin of words like, for instance, ''art'' ("arable", "cultivation"; culture, art), ''aryyun'' ("blood"), ''argand'' ("womb"), ''armat'' ("root"), ''arka'' ("king"), ''ara'' ("male"), ''Arev'' (the Sun), ''Ara'' (manifested Ar), ''Ari'' (acting with Ar), ''Chari'' (opposing Ar).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=115|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=271}} The "essence of things" and their "perfection" is represented by ''[[swastika]]'' motifs.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}

====Ari and Chari, and the many deities====
The different deities are conceived by the supreme Ara. Some Arordiners do not consider them to be separate beings, but as "incarnations of different aspects of Ara". They are organised in a cosmic duality, representing the "light side" and the "dark side" of the universal power, with the latter led by Vishap, the great snake, whom is identified as being the same as [[Yahweh]].{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} The history of mankind itself is seen as a constant struggle between these two forces: One represented by Ari (Aryans), the right men of the creative light side; the other one represented by Chari, destructive dark-sided creatures made from soil by Vishap.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}}

The Armenian Native Faith is [[polytheism|polytheistic]] in practice.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} The gods of the Arordiners include:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} [[Hayk]], the mythical founder of the Armenian nation, [[Aray]] the god of war, [[Barsamin]] the god of sky and weather, Aralez the god of the dead, [[Anahit]] the goddess of fertility and war, [[Mithra|Mihr]] the [[solar god]], [[Astghik]] the goddess of love and beauty, Nuneh the goddess of wisdom, [[Tir (god)|Tir]] the god of art and inspiration, [[Tsovinar (goddess)|Tsovinar]] the goddess of waters, Amanor the god of hospitality, [[Spandaramet]] the goddess of death, and Gissaneh the [[mother goddess]] of nature.

===Afterlife and eschatology===
The Arordiners have a cyclical view of reality, and they believe in the [[reincarnation]] of individual souls through the genetic lineage. That is to say, men are believed to come back to life in the following generations of their own descendants, in the kin which they begot while living.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} According to Arordiner doctrines, the entire world goes through similar cycles, from the smaller ones represented by the days and the years, to the greatest ones represented by eras of ten thousand years.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273–274}}

The struggle between light and dark forces unfolds through the cycle of each era: Order and connection with the ancestors prevail during the world's summer and spring; while disorder, confusion and forsaking of the ancestral roots prevail during the world's autumn and winter. In the latter period, beings are not in harmony with Ara, they are not nourished by cosmic energy, and they fall prey of the evil Chari forces. At the darkest stage of history, though, which according to Arordiners corresponds to the current times, Vahagn manifests again and brings the Ari forces back to life.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273–274}}

===The ''Ukhtagirk''===
''Ukhtagirk'', the holy book of the Armenian Native Faith, may be translated as "Book of Vows". It was the life work of Slak Kakosyan, who finished the manuscript just before his death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} Kakosyan, however, is not credited as the "author" of the ''Ukhtagirk'', but rather as the "recorder" of an eternal truth understood by inspiration,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} its "compiler" (''kazmogh'').{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} The book was officially proclaimed the holy text of the Order of the Children of Ari in 2000, a couple of years before its completion, when the religious organisation was officially registered by the Armenian state.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}

The book is divided into seven parts: ① ''Astvatsashoonch'' ("Dictionary"), which explains the Armenian language as a mystical system of symbols related to the root ''Ar''; ② ''Tsagumnaran'' ("Genesis"), which explains in mythical terms the origin of the world, the gods and mankind; ③ ''Avetaran'' ("Book of Testaments") and ④ ''Dzonaran'' ("Book of Odes"), which deal with philosophical and ontological categories to explain reality and values; ⑤ ''Veharan'' ("Book of Greatness") and ⑥ ''Patgamaran'' ("Book of Commandments"), which present mythologised descriptions of Garegin Nzhdeh's life and ideas, respectively; and the seventh and last chapter, ⑦ ''Hymnergaran'' ("Book of Hymns"), which is a collection of poems written by Kakosyan and his followers, as well as by authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The mythological parts about creation rely upon Armenian medieval sources and folk knowledge.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271–272}}

Chanting ritual texts from the book is considered to procure mystical experiences, and the physical book itself is crucial for some ritual activities, such as wedding ceremonies, in which the rings are passed to the bride and groom on top of a copy of the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} At the same time, Arordiners do not consider their book unquestionable, but the text is open to corrections as required by changing circumstances. This attitude is supported by a declaration of Slak Kakosyan himself, who conceived the book in the terms of a changeful and adaptable truth.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}}

==Practices==
[[File:Hetan priest officiating at Garni Temple, Armenia 30.jpg|thumb|300px|People gathered on the occasion of a public ceremony at the Temple of Garni.]]
Armenian Native Faith practices, rituals and representations mostly rely on the instructions given by the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} For instance, it is common for the priests to make pilgrimage to [[Khustup|Mount Khustup]], where, according to the book, Garegin Nzhdeh experienced the presence of the god Vahagn.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The priests' aim is to replicate such experience.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The veneration of Nzhdeh and the pilgrimage to his burial site, which is located on the slopes of the Khustup, is also slowly developing within the larger community of Arordiners.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110, note 14}} In general, mountains are revered as holy, so, besides Khustup, other mountains, including [[Mount Ararat]] and [[Mount Aragats]], function as pilgrimage destination for Arordiners.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275, 278}}

The memory of Slak Kakosyan is also part of the cults celebrated by the Arordiner priests. The celebrations in honour of Vahagn at the [[Temple of Garni]] usually start at the memorial monument of Kakosyan, set up after his death on the site where his ashes were dispersed.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} The figure of Kakosyan has been mythologised in a collection of poems composed by Aren Haykyan and published in 2007. In these poems he is described as a divine man.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} Haykyan is also the author of poems devoted to Nzhdeh and to the gods.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=278}}

===Rituals===
[[File:Hetan initiation ritual (0).PNG|thumb|Stage of a ''knunk'' ritual.]]
Armenian Native Faith rituals include the yearly ceremonies performed on Armenian traditional holidays, and three [[rites of passage]]: The ''knunk'', a complex ritual of initiation; the ''psak'', that is wedding; and death rituals.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} The death rituals require the [[cremation]] of the body,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} and its return to the four elements. Fire is symbolised by the cremation itself; then the ashes are divided into three parts, of which one is buried in the earth, one is scattered in the air of the [[Garni Gorge]], and the third one is poured in the water of the Garni River.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}} Afterwards, the deceased is memorialised by the collective lighting of a torch.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=278}} The first Arordiner to be cremated was Kakosyan himself, at a time when cremation was illegal in Armenia. Later, Arordiners obtained by the state the right to cremate their dead.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}}

The Armenian term ''knunk'' may be translated as "conversion" or "reversion" (to the native way of life).{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}} Yulia Antonyan observed that about ten to twenty people take part to each ''knunk'' ritual, which is held on the occasion of the public ceremonies at the Temple of Garni. At the same time, there are many Arordiners who believe that in order to worship the native gods of Armenia it is not necessary to undergo an official conversion.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}}

===Temples and idols===
Arordiner public ceremonies and rituals are held at ancient sacred places, which are often in ruins.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The re-appropriation of churches that were built on native sacred sites is also common.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The most important of these sites is the first-century Temple of Garni, a temple which was rebuilt in 1975, which has become the main ceremonial center for the Armenian Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}

The Arordiners have reconsecrated the temple to Vahagn, although historically it was dedicated to Mihr. They have also been given approval for the rearrangement of the compound, in order for it to match the ideal structure of ancient Armenian sanctuaries.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} They have added a holy spring dedicated to Slak Kakosyan and a wood of [[apricot]] trees, the holy tree of Armenian Native Faith. The temple is now organised into three sacred spaces: The first is the sacred spring, the second one is the temple proper, and the third one is the holy wood, located on a hillock.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=119|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2pp=275–277}} The rituals at the Temple of Garni take place following a route which starts from the spring, passes through the temple, and endly reaches the holy wood.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} Downhill, each newly established local Arordiner community plants a tree, symbolising the unity and well-being of the group itself. These holy trees are adorned with ribbons and handkerchiefs symbolising one's requests to the gods.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275–277}}

Besides the Temple of Garni, other sites considered holy by the Arordiners and used for their rituals include the [[Metsamor Castle]] (third millennium BCE), considered a site for the cult of the mother goddess, the [[Erebuni Fortress]] (eighth century BCE), [[Shengavit Settlement|Shengavit]] (fourth to second millennium BCE) and [[Zorats Karer]] (third millennium BCE), and the mountains.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275–277}} Sculptures representing the gods which have been realised within the context of modern Armenian Native Faith are inspired by both historical specimens and the creativity of modern artists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}

===Holidays===
The Arordiners celebrate a number of holidays:{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} Terendez, Zatik, Hambardzum, [[Vardavar]] and Khaghoghorhnek. To these holy days they add a holy day for the remembrance of ancestors (20 September), the Birth of Vahagn (21 March), the Birth of Mihr (22 December) and the Navasard, the New Year celebrated in August.

==Relations with Christianity==
[[File:Պար Գառնում.jpg|thumb|A ritual dance at the Temple of Garni.]]
The relations between the Armenian Native Faith movement and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] have been good and collaborative, since both share the common interest of protecting and promoting Armenian identity, especially against what are perceived as disruptive foreign forces infiltrating the country, such as Protestants, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mormonism|Mormons]].{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} The Armenian Apostolic Church generally sees Arordiners as allies. A high-ranking spokesman of the Armenian Apostolic Church declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}

{{Quote|The Armenian Church has an unequivocal stance on sectarians (i.e. Protestants et al.), but we do not interfere into pagan affairs.}}

Similarly, the head of an Armenian institution catering to the victims of destructive cults declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}

{{Quote|The Armenian nation must remember its pre-Christian past, and Ara's Children help them remember. They also support the Armenian Apostolic Church in its fight against destructive sects.}}

Armenian Native Faith believers' attitude towards Christianity oscillates between two positions: The critique of the religion's role in Armenian history, and the conditional acceptance of the Armenian Apostolic Church as a national institution.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} Christianity is criticised for having destroyed the rich and highly developed ancient Armenian culture, replacing the values of courage, martial spirit and honour with those of humility, obedience and modesty, thus causing the collapse of Armenian statehood and condemning the nation to centuries of subordination to foreign powers, migrations, persecutions and massacres.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} According to the strongest accusations, Christianity is responsible for the "first genocide of the Armenians", which coincided with its forceful introduction in the fourth century.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}

At the same time, the Armenian Apostolic Church is considered an institution peculiar to the Armenian nation, and the fruit of a synthesis of Christian and indigenous elements, in which the former represent just the surface. The Arordiners find proof of this in the Church's prayers devoted to the Sun and light, in Church festivals overlapping indigenous Armenian festivals, and in the practice of ''matagh'', Christian animal sacrifice. Moreover, the Arordiners believe that the Armenian alphabet, which Church historiography holds to have been invented by the monk Mesrop Mahtots, is actually an elaboration of ancient Armenian symbolism based on the motif of the ''[[swastika]]''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}

Arordiners generally do not have problems visiting Armenian churches and treating them as holy places, since many of them were built on the site of pre-Christian temples. Furthermore, some figures of the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church are revered as Arordiners in disguise: The ''[[catholicos|catholicoi]]'' (high-ranking bishops) Vazgen I (in charge 1954–1994) and Garegin I (1995–1999). The former was a supporter of Nzhdeh and on his tombstone, instead of a cross, he has a letter of the Armenian alphabet which is considered a variant of the ''swastika'' and symbolic of seven Armenian gods. The latter is said to have visited Garni before his death and, despite being terminally ill, to have walked alone to the temple.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}

Most courses come in two forms - "core" for average students, and "supplemental" for advanced students. The school offers Junior youth groups where students are placed into different groups to discuss their lives. Each group is run by an animator who is a girl in senior grades and the other members are junior girls.

==Accreditation and awards==

==Etymology==
The name comes from the Sanskrit words ''bhujanga'' meaning "snake" or "serpent" and ''asana'' (आसन) meaning "posture" or "seat".


From a [[Prone position|prone]] position with [[Palm (hand)|palms]] and [[legs]] on the floor, the [[chest]] is lifted.
This asana resembles a serpent with its hood raised. Cobra Pose or Bhujangasana is part of the sequence of yoga postures in Padma Sadhana and Surya Namaskar or Sun Salutation. Bhujangasana is pronounced as BHU-jung-AAHS-uh-nuh.
Bhujang = Snake (Cobra); Asana = Posture or Pose

To get into this position, come onto the ground on your stomach. Place both palms under the shoulders. Draw your elbows towards your side body. Keeping the gaze down towards your mat, maintain a neutral neck. As you inhale, push down through the palms and lift the chest, engaging the core and lifting the quads off the ground. Tops of the feet should still press into the ground. The neck remains neutral and the gaze stays on the ground.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Benefits ==
Bhujangasana may strengthen the [[vertebral column|spine]], stretch the chest, shoulders, and abdomen, firm the [[buttocks]], remove lethargy relieve stress and fatigue and makes practitioner active. Traditional texts say that Bhujangasana increases body heat, destroys disease, and awakens [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]]. The practitioner gets benefited by the qualities that a cobra have i.e. a good digestion, supple body, activeness, and longevity.

==Cautions==
Common postural errors during this asana include overarching the neck and lower back. One recommendation is to keep the gaze directed down at the floor and focus on bringing movement into the area between the shoulder blades (the thoracic area, or middle back).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogajournal.com/for_teachers/2551 Yoga for Chronic Pain, Part I], By Timothy McCall, M.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Follow-up asanas==
Bhujangasana is followed by [[Salabhasana]].  In [[Surya Namaskar]], it precedes [[Adho Mukha Svanasana]].

'''Dave Considine''' is one of North America's few [[Laity|lay]] religious [[Demonology|demonologists]] that is sanctioned by [[Traditionalist Catholic|Traditionalist Catholic Churches]]{{according to whom|date=October 2013}}. In his twenty-six year career, he has handled thousands of cases along with his team involving psychic phenomena, historic hauntings, human hauntings, elemental hauntings, poltergeists, demonic infestations, possession and exorcism, the occult, UFOs, missing time, preternatural physical / non-physical entity encounters, abductions and missing people, human / animal mutilations, governmental &amp; religious cover-ups.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Early life==
Born in rural Connecticut, at the age of twelve Considine believes he had a terrifying [[supernatural]] experience which altered the course of his life. A short time later, he decided to dedicate his life to investigating the supernatural, focusing on ways to assist individuals and families believed to be victimized by entities from the supernatural realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guests/861.html |title=Guests |publisher=Coast to Coast AM |date= |accessdate=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two active tours of duty with the US Armed Forces, he founded Phantasm Psychic Research in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2xHbh7EEuKIC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Dave+Considine+exorcist&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z1ZcUtmmMcPfiAKQooGwBw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Dave%20Considine%20exorcist&amp;f=false Ghosthunters: On the Trail of Mediums, Dowsers, Spirit Seekers, and Other Investigators of America's Paranormal World] by John Kachuba Career Press, 2007 Pages 69 thru 74  Accessed via Google Books October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; dividing his time between his own organization and being the assistant to Catholic exorcist + O.P Bishop [[Robert McKenna]] and has been working in the field for 27 years.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Work==
Trained directly by Demonologists [[Ed and Lorraine Warren]], Considine has worked closely through the years with many other noted figures in the fields of paranormal research, religious demonology, exorcism and the occult.  These include the aforementioned Ed Warren, religious demonologist and director and founder of the New England Society of Psychic Research; Fr. [[Malachi Martin]], author of ''Hostage to the Devil''; Fr. James Lebar of the New York Archdiocese; and Fr. Rama Coomaraswamy, M.D., assistant director of the Albert Einstein institute of Psychiatry.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

According to his official profile on College Power Performers, a professional college speaker booking agency, Considine said this about his personal views and beliefs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepowerperformers.com/dave-considine.php |title=Ghost Hunters &amp; Paranormal |publisher=College Power Performers |date= |accessdate=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Dave's priorities differ greatly than those who investigate strictly with scientific interests. His goal is the spiritual well being of the individual or family, getting them through these life-altering events and back on the path away from the preternatural realms and he firmly believes that the individual or family's strength and faith in God can bring an end to most hauntings. He believes that there is more than just a patch of grass and a marker over our heads when we die, and that when we die it is not an end, but a new beginning.}}

Considine has also said,&lt;ref name="phantasmpsiresearch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phantasmpsiresearch.com/dave.htm |title=dave |website=Phantasmpsiresearch.com |date=2004-10-29 |accessdate=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As a religious demonologist, I often see people at rock bottom - terrified, desperate... The most rewarding part of my job is helping them put their lives back together. I see the trauma they go through, and I help them to fight back, using their faith. I hate seeing people victimized by the demonic, but it's incredibly gratifying to watch them come back, more faithful and stronger than they've ever been before.}}

Considine attributes his success in his field to his strong faith in God and the support of his family and investigative team members.

===Media===
He has been a guest for many media agencies for his expertise including [[CNN]], [[BBC]], [[New Dominion Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]] ''[[The Devil Inside (film)|The Devil Inside'']], Gold Circle Productions ''A Haunting In New York'' (2014), Stone House Productions ''The Demonologists'' and has appeared in numerous documentaries including [[Jane Goldman Investigates]] ''[[Poltergeists]]'',  [[Discovery Channel|Discovery Channel's]]  documentary TV series ''[[A Haunting]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0112918/?ref_=fn_al_ch_1 A Haunting: character of Dave Considine appearance list] from IMDB.com  Accessed October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; episodes "Hell House", "The Diabolical", "The Presence", "Marked By Evil" and the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'s ''[[MysteryQuest]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3564216/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 Dave Considine - Appearances as SELF] from IMBD.com Accessed October 14, 2013 Return to the Amityville Horror.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phantasmpsiresearch.com/ahaunting.htm |title=ahaunting |website=Phantasmpsiresearch.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considine also claims to have been a consultant for many well known authors including John Kachuba (''Ghost Hunters''), William H. Kennedy (''Satanic Crimes''), Jeff Messenger (''The Shroud of Torrington''), Cheri Ravai (''Haunted New York City'') among others. He has had his work written about in ''Maxim'' magazine, and many online publications such as ''Money Magazine'', ''Something Cool'' in Canada, ''The Online Dictionary of Psychiatry'', ''The Examiner'', ''The One Matrix'', ''Paranormal UnderGround Magazine''. He has been a featured guest on many talk radio programs including ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' with George Noory, ''The 'X' Zone'' with Rob McConnell, ''The Jerry Pippin Show'', ''Sphinx Radio'', ''The Alan Eisenberg Show'', Dr. Stanley Monteith's ''Radio Liberty'', ''Tuesday After Twilight'', ''Darkness Radio'', ''The Reign'', ''Phase 3 Paranormal Radio'', ''Paranormal Underground'', ''Fate Magazine Radio'' and ''Para X Radio'' and is currently the producer and host of ''This Week In Paranormal History'' and the co-host of the Grand Dark Conspiracy radio program's ''Darkest Hours'' on 1270 WQTT every Friday night from 2 AM - 4 AM EST.

He is currently involved with multiple feature film and documentary projects and is in the process of co-writing a book which will highlight cases Phantasm Psychic Research has been involved with over the years.{{fact|date=June 2016}}

A '''Dojang''' ("Dao center") is a [[place of worship]] of the religion of [[Jeung San Do]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeungsando.org/jsd-me/dojangs-dao-centers/ |title=Dojangs – Dao Centers |website=jeungsando.org |access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeungics gather in these temples to meditate, study and worship.

Each dojang has a main room called the sung-jun "sacred shrine", which contains altars for celestial and terrestrial spirits. Typically there are at least four altars: one with Sahng-jeh-nim's portrait, another with Tae-mo-nim's portrait, one representing a local terrestrial spirit, and one enshrining the spirit tablets of the practitioner's ancestors.

Some dojangs have additional altars to honor other regional spirits, tribal spirits, the spirits of those who played a significant role in Jeungic history, or the spirits of those who greatly benefited humanity.

Most of the meditation, study, and instruction at a dojang takes place in the sung-jun in the presence of the spirits. It is a place for heaven, earth, and humans to unite as one.

The religion has developed a congregational system, hymns to be sung composed in the Tani ritual language of shamans, a formalised [[philosophy]]-[[theology]] and [[iconography]] of the gods&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; and temples.&lt;ref&gt;Dalmia, Sadana, 2012. pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; The pioneer of the revival was [[Talom Rukbo]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Donyi-Polo is related to the Hemphu-Mukrang religion of the [[Karbi people|Karbi]] and the Nyezi-No of the [[Hruso people|Hruso]].

==Theology and cosmology==

===''Sedi'' and ''Keyum''===
In the Donyi-Polo belief, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|fountain god that begets the universe]] ([[God]] or the Godhead) is referred to as ''Sedi'' by the [[Minyong tribe|Minyong]] and ''[[Padam tribe|Padam]]'', ''Jimi'' by the [[Galo tribe|Galo]].&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. pp. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;  All things and beings are parts of the body of ''Sedi'':&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. pp. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; in creation, the hair of ''Sedi'' becomes the plants of the earth, his tears become rain and water, his bones become rocks and stones, and his two eyes become ''Donyi'' (the Sun) and ''Polo'' (the Moon).&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. pp. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sedi'', after creation, is a ''[[deus otiosus]]'' but continues to observe creation through his eyes, his double aspect veiling-unveiling-revealing himself.&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. pp. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

In Galo beliefs, ''Jimi'' manifests as ''Melo'' (Sky) and ''Sidi'' (Earth), out of the interaction of which all things and beings are born, including ''Donyi'' and ''Polo''.&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; There are other myths explaining the meaning of the duality ''Donyi'' and ''Polo''.&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. pp. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Talom Rukbo]]'s theology, all celestial bodies including Earth, all things, originate from one source, ''Keyum'' (nothingness or the vacuum).&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; ''Donyi''-''Polo'' is the polar force that generates all stars; the physical Sun and Moon (respectively, ''Bomong'' and ''Boo'') near the Earth and humanity, are bodily manifestations of the universal unseen power ''Donyi''-''Polo'', with ''Bomong'' carrying out the centralising power of ''Donyi'', and ''Boo'' the ''Polo'' power of life-giving.&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Donyi'' and ''Polo''===
''Donyi'' (Sun) and ''Polo'' (Moon)—which are, respectively, female and male in the Tibeto-Burman tradition; called ''Ane Donyi'' ("Mother Sun") and ''Abo Polo'' ("Father Moon")&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;—constitute a notion similar to the [[yin and yang]] of [[Chinese culture]]. It is the analogy through which the Divinity (''Sedi'') can be described,&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. pp. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt; representing the way in which the divine principle manifests itself, that is: eternally veiling, unveiling and then revealing himself in nature; providing harmony and balance to the universe, for example in the alternation of light and darkness, heat and cool, or unity (analogically, the Sun of the daily sky) and multiplicity (analogically, the stars of the night sky).&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

The practical expression of the faith in Donyi-Polo can be found in the daily life and actions of people: they call themselves "''Donyi O, Polo Ome''", meaning "children of the sun and the moon".&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; When a believer is distressed he invokes "''Donyi''-''Polo''".&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; If a man is falsely accused of lying he invokes "''Donyi-e!''", "oh Sun!".&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; All these are expressions of faith in Donyi-Polo upholding providently the world, rewarding the righteous and punishing wrong-doers.&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The divine pair is revered as the highest holy figure governing fate.&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

"Donyi-Polo" is also used in the sense of "truth" in sacral speech.&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; "Donyi-Polo" is an epitome for wisdom, enlightenment, right conscience, truthfulness, and selflessness.&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Aware people are called "''Donyi''-''Polo Ome''", which means "children of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Elders are regarded as "''Donyi''-''Polo Abu''", "representatives of the truth".&lt;ref&gt;Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gods===
The followers of Donyi-Poloism worship a variety of gods and goddesses that enliven nature.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; These gods are believed to partake in the universal balance of ''Donyi'' and ''Polo'', and to be multiple manifestations or identities of ''Sedi''—''Donyi''-''Polo'', each with specific functions and roles.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that they take care of the earth and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The main deities in Donyi-Polo are ''Donyi'' and ''Polo'', ''Kine Nane'', ''Doying Bote'', ''Pedong Nane'' and ''Guumin Soyin''.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Abotani''==
[[Tani languages|Tani-speaking]] peoples ([[Apatani people|Apatani]], [[Galo tribe|Galo]], [[Nishi people|Nishi]], [[Tagin people|Tagin]], [[Na people|Na]], [[Mishing people|Mishing]]; [[Adi people|Adi]]-[[Lhoba people|Lhoba]]) share a myth telling of their descendance from the [[progenitor]] [[Abotani]].&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] peoples of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] who share the Donyi-Polo faith don't subscribe to the descendance from Abotani.&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Abotani is thought to represent the evolution of the human being from the source ''Donyi'', ''Sedi'',&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; the eye of the universe as important to man as the eye of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The Divinity has projected man showing him the right way to go.&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conscience and ethics==
Donyi-Poloists describe the "Donyi-Polo" nature of the universe as the eyes of human conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Happiness is given through right action, and right action is that which follows the order of nature (Donyi-Polo).&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Oshang Ering, a philosopher of the religion, has written that as the two objects in the sky (''Bomong'' and ''Boo'') focus light to enable us to see what is what, Donyi-Polo makes us aware of what is wrong and right.&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Right conscience naturally prevails.&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; When a person does wrong things (acts against the natural order) and tries to hide it, or masks it as good, then the force of conscience (Donyi-Polo) imposes a psychological pression, and the wrong doer loses happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Right conscience naturally guides man.&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; According to the traditional belief, love, compassion, equality and selflessness are naturally ordained by Donyi-Polo; they are inscribed in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Rikam, 2005. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ethics|ethical]] dimension of Donyi-Polo also means purity, beauty, simplicity, and frankness.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institution==
On 28 August 1968, a meeting of [[Adi people|Adi]] intellectuals was held in [[Along, Arunachal Pradesh|Along]], [[West Siang district|West Siang]], to discuss countermeasures to be taken against the gradual erosion of indigenous identity and traditions attributed to [[India]]'s policy of integration of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], and particularly the rapid, aggressive and coercive proselytizing of [[Christianity]] in the area since the 1950s which has caused an enduring crisis in the cultural mosaic of the north-eastern state.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting's aim was also that of uniting the Tibeto-Burman folks under a collective identity and values for a good life.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Talom Rukbo]] emerged as the father of Donyi-Poloism, a term that was coined for the institutionalisation of the Tibeto-Burman folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. pp. 263-264&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rukbo, the main reason of the easy erosion of the traditional culture was that it lacked a written literature.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; So, with the aim of recovering the endangered rituals, prayers and hymns, within 1986 three major cultural organisations were founded: the Tani Jagriti Foundation, the Donyi-Polo Youth Federation and the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

Rukbo expressed the need for institutionalisation of the traditional faith in these terms:&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;
:«''Tradition means the way of living of a society practicing its socio-religious culture, economic life, the way of preserving history, literature and all other norms of social life inherited from time immemorial which may be called social character and identity''».

Many Adi and Tani intellectuals reflected Rukbo's ideas, and these gradually spread across the tribes and even beyond the Tani people.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; The 31 December, the day of establishment of the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang in 1986, has been made the "Donyi-Polo Day" celebrated each year.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, templar areas (''gangging'') have been consecrated, religious literature and prayer hymns have been collected and published.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; To meet the growing number of adherents in the revival, the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang established orientation courses—which take place twice a year—and trained groups of youth to send back with books and icons to their home village, to encourage people to construct temples and conduct prayers.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; During the last two decades the spiritual revival has spread all over Arunachal Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the revival have coined the slogan «''Loss of culture is loss of identity''» which has become very popular. The indirect implication is that those who convert to [[Christianity]] lose their culture and hence their identity.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; 

===''Gangging''===
A ''gangging'' is a general name for a prayer place of the Donyi-Poloist faith, and especially in the [[Adi people|Adi]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The ''gangging'' as a [[sacred]] enclosure is a concept popularised by the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Talom Rukbo, the word ''gangging'' is derived from ''Gangging Siring'', the concept of a land or [[tree of life|holy tree]] that mediates between the spiritual and the natural worlds,&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; and from which any thing, living or non-living, comes into existence.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gangging'' congregants have to follow certain rules: for example, male members must sit on the left in rows, and female members on the right, cross-legged.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Within the prayer place, there should not be any noise during prayer except the sound of the hymns.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Prayers are organized in the prayer place on Sundays, and all of the ''gangging'' branches established in each of the villages under the Siang district are centrally regulated by the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Through the prayer place, codified rituals and practices, and [[iconography|iconographies]] of the Gods and Goddesses have been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic variations===
In [[Galo tribe|Galo]] areas, the prayer place and community halls (''dere'') have come up under the patronage of the Donyi-Polo Welfare Association and they are being built since the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Priests (''nyibu'') conduct prayers in the prayer place on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Apatani people|Apatani]] areas, the religion is called "Danyi-Piilo" and prayer place are called ''meder nello'' ("purified place"), the first of which was built in 2004&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Songs and prayers are collected in a prayer book called ''Lyambope''.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Donyi-Poloist prayer place in [[Nishi people|Nishi]] areas are called ''nyedar namlo'' ("pure place"), and also among them the movement has been started only in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the success of Donyi-Polo has crossed the Tani cultural borders inspiring the rise of Rangfraism among the [[Tangsa people|Tangsa]], and of Intayaism among the [[Mishmi people|Mishmi]], respectively in [[Changlang district|Changlang]] and [[Dibang Valley district|Dibang Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, 2013. pp. 274-275&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6828">The '''''Feriale Duranum''''' is a calendar of [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious observances]] for a Roman military garrison at [[Dura-Europos]] on the [[Euphrates]], [[Roman Syria]], under the reign of [[Severus Alexander]] (224–235 AD). The small [[papyrus]] roll was discovered among the documents of an [[Cohort (military unit)|auxiliary cohort]], the ''[[Cohors XX Palmyrenorum]]'' (Twentieth Cohort of [[Palmyra|Palmyrenes]]),{{sfnp|Kreitzer|1996|page=72}}{{sfnp|Hekster|2008|page=66}} in the Temple of [[Atargatis|Azzanathkona]].{{sfnp|Pollard|2000|page=142}} The calendar, written in [[Latin]], is arranged in four columns, with some gaps. It offers important evidence for the [[Religion in the ancient Roman military|religious life of the Roman military]] and the role of [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] in promoting loyalty to the [[Roman emperor]],{{sfnp|Kreitzer|1996|page=72}} and for the coexistence of Roman state religion and local religious traditions.{{sfnp|Dirven|1999|pages=184–185}}{{sfnp|Pollard|2000|page=143}}

[[Roman festivals|Festivals]] named include [[Quinquatria]] (a purification of arms), the [[Parilia|birthday of Rome]], [[Neptunalia]] and two [[Rosalia (festival)|Rosaliae]] at which the military standards were adorned with roses.{{sfnp|Hekster|2008|page=81}} The calendar prescribes sacrifices for [[List of Roman deities|deities of traditional Roman religion]] such as the [[Capitoline triad]] of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], and [[Minerva]], as well as [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]].{{sfnp|Hekster|2008|page=81}} About twenty members of the imperial family are honored as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|divi]]'', divinized mortals, including six women and [[Germanicus]], who was never an emperor.{{sfnp|Kreitzer|1996|page=72}} Twenty-seven of the forty-three entries that remain legible pertain to Imperial cult.{{sfnp|Kreitzer|1996|page=72}} No Eastern [[mystery religions]], which were widely celebrated in the Empire during this period, nor local cults are recorded as an official observance of the army,{{sfnp|Kreitzer|1996|pages=72-73}} but the ''feriale'' was found in the temple with a [[wikt:dipinto|dipinto]] depicting a Roman officer offering incense to the local deity [[Iarhibol|Iarḥibol]], and Romans, including a standard-bearer with the cohort's ''[[vexillum]]'', standing before the altar of the Syrian gods Iarḥibol, [[Aglibol]] and [[Arsu|Arṣu]].{{sfnp|Dirven|1999|page=187}} It has also been argued that the three gods represent the emperors [[Pupienus]], [[Balbinus]], and [[Gordian III]].{{sfnp|Pollard|2000|page=143}} A copy of the calendar may have been issued to each unit throughout the Empire to further military cohesion as well as Roman identity among troops from other cultures.{{sfnp|Dirven|1999|pages=184–185}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pollard|2000|pages=143}} (especially note 126), 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cache of documents was discovered by a team of archaeologists from [[Yale University]] working at Dura-Europos in 1931–32.{{sfnp|Kreitzer|1996|page=72}} It was first published by [[Robert O. Fink|R. O. Fink]], A. S. Hooey, and W. S. Snyder (1940), "The ''Feriale Duranum''," ''Yale Classical Studies'' 7: 1–222.{{sfnp|Pollard|2000|page=142}}

In 2011, a facsimile of the partial document was part of the Dura-Europos exhibition at Boston College, and it contained the following translation:

The [[Bhavishya Purana]] contains the following: "At this time, reminded of the Kali Age, the god Vishnu became born as Gautama, the [[Shakyamuni]], and taught the Buddhist dharma for ten years. Then Shuddodana ruled for twenty years, and Shakyasimha for twenty. At the first stage of the [[Kali Yuga|Kali Age]], the path of the Vedas was destroyed and all men became Buddhists.

==Hinduism==
{{main|Gautama Buddha in Hinduism}}
[[File:Avatarbuddha.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Some Hindus regard Buddha as the 9th [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]].]]
Gautama Buddha is mentioned as an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in the [[Puranic]] texts of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/en1 Bhagavata Purana, Canto 1, Chapter 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521022342/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/en1 |date=21 May 2013 }} - SB 1.3.24: "Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of Anjana, in the province of Gaya, just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist." ... SB 1.3.28: "All of the above-mentioned incarnations [avatars] are either plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions of the Lord [Krishna or Vishnu]"&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bhagavata Purana]] he is twenty fourth of twenty five avatars, prefiguring a forthcoming final incarnation. A number of [[Hindu]] traditions portray Buddha as the most recent of ten principal avatars, known as the [[Dashavatara]] (''Ten Incarnations of God'').

Siddhartha Gautama's teachings deny the authority of the [[Vedas]] and consequently [at least atheistic] Buddhism is generally viewed as a ''[[Nastika|nāstika]]'' school (heterodox, literally "It is not so"&lt;ref&gt;"in Sanskrit philosophical literature, 'āstika' means 'one who believes in the authority of the Vedas' or 'one who believes in life after death'. ('nāstika' means the opposite of these).  The word is used here in the first sense." Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta.  An Introduction to Indian Philosophy. Eighth Reprint Edition. (University of Calcutta: 1984). p. 5, footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt;) from the perspective of orthodox Hinduism.

Many of the eighteen orthodox Puranas mention the Buddha in a less favouring light. They present the birth of the Buddha as a ploy by the Supreme God Vishnu to corrupt demons and sway them from Vedic teachings. Only by leading them astray with his teachings could the demons be destroyed. This belief is sometimes associated with the Asuras of Tripura (the three citadels) as well as others. Literature from the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]], on the other hand, maintains that [[Krishna]] took the appearance of an atheistic teacher out of benevolence, in order to trick atheists into worshipping God (i.e., himself).

==Sikhism==
Buddha is mentioned as the 23rd avatar of Vishnu in the [[Chaubis Avtar]], a composition in Dasam Granth traditionally and historically attributed to [[Guru Gobind Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.info-sikh.com/VVPage1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taoism, Confucianism and Shinto==
{{main|Buddhism and Eastern teaching}}
Some early Chinese Taoist-Buddhists thought the Buddha to be a reincarnation of [[Lao Tzu]].&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of China, Vol.1, (The Ch'in and Han Empires, 221 BC—220 BC) {{ISBN|0-521-24327-0}} hardback&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, since one of the symbols of [[Vairocana|Dainichi Nyorai]] (one of the non-historical buddhas of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism) was the sun, many equated [[Amaterasu]], the Sun Goddess, with a previous reincarnation (bodhisattva) of Dainichi Nyorai.

==Ahmadiyya Muslim Community==
[[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], the Fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], in his book ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth]]'', argues that Buddha was indeed a prophet of God who preached Monotheism. He quotes from the inscriptions on Ashoka's stupas which mention "Isa'na" which means God. He quotes, "'Thus spake Devanampiya Piyadasi: "Wherefore from this very hour, I have caused religious discourses to be preached, I have appointed religious observances that mankind, having listened thereto, shall be brought to follow in the right path, and give glory to God* (Is'ana)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_2_section_2.html ''Al-Islam.org''] Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth, Mirza Tahir Ahmad, Chapter, Buddhism.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahmadiyya hold the view that the Buddha was indeed a [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Prophet of God]].

[[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]] has also stated that the Qur'anic figure called [[Dhul-Kifl]] may have been the Buddha in his book "An Elementary Study of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alislam.org/books/study-of-islam/prophets.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, a verse in the Qur'an quotes that God has sent many prophets to thee (Humanity). However, only a few have been named. It is believed by some{{Who|date=September 2018}} that Buddha may (or may not) have been a Prophet of God sent to his people who taught Monotheism.

[[File:Christ et Buddha by Paul Ranson 1880.JPG|right|thumb|190px|''Christ and Buddha'' by [[Paul Ranson]], 1880]]
The Greek legend of "[[Barlaam and Josaphat|Barlaam and Ioasaph]]", sometimes mistakenly attributed to the 7th century [[John of Damascus]] but actually written by the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] monk [[Euthymius of Athos|Euthymius]] in the 11th century, was ultimately derived, through a variety of intermediate versions ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]]) from the life story of the Buddha. The king-turned-monk Ioasaph (Georgian ''Iodasaph'', Arabic ''Yūdhasaf'' or ''Būdhasaf'': Arabic "b" could become "y" by [[Arabic alphabet|duplication of a dot]] in handwriting) ultimately derives his name from the Sanskrit [[Bodhisattva]], the name used in Buddhist accounts for Gautama before he became a Buddha.&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Barlaam and Josaphat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wiekisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Barlaam_and_Josaphat|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Article on Barlaam and Josaphat}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barlaam and Ioasaph were placed in the Greek Orthodox calendar of [[saint]]s on 26 August, and in the West they were entered as "[[Barlaam and Josaphat]]" in the Roman Martyrology on the date of 27 November.

==Judaism==
The story was translated into Hebrew in the 13th century by [[Abraham Ibn Chisdai]] (or Hasdai) as "Ben-Hamelekh Vehanazir" ("The Prince and the [[Nazirite]]").{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Bahá'í Faith==
In the Bahá'í Faith, Buddha is classified as one of the [[Manifestations of God]] which is a title for a major prophet in the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref&gt;Hornby, Helen Bassett (1994). ''Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File''. Bahá'í Publishing Trust (New Deli, India), [http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2&amp;chapter=4#n1684 p. 502 (#1684)]. {{ISBN|81-85091-46-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Prophet]] of the Bahá'í Faith, [[Bahá'u'lláh]], is believed by Bahá'ís to be the [[Fifth Buddha]], among other prophetic stations.&lt;ref&gt;''The Kitáb-i-Aqdas: The Most Holy Book''. Bahá'í Publishing Trust (Wilmette, Illinois, USA), [http://bahai-library.com/writings/bahaullah/aqdas/kaall.html#233 p. 233 (#1684)]. {{ISBN|0-85398-999-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gurdwara Dukh Nivaran Sahib''' is situated in what used to be the village of Lehal, now part of [[Patiala]] city.

==History==
[[File:Dukh Nivaran darbar sahib.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Darbar Sahib]]    
According to local tradition, supported by an old handwritten document preserved in the [[Gurdwara]], one Bhag Ram, a jhivar of Lehal, waited upon [[Sikh Gurus|ninth guru]] of [[Sikhs]] [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] during his sojourn at Saifabad (now Bahadurgarh), and made the request that he might be pleased to visit and bless his village so that its inhabitants could be rid of a serious and mysterious sickness which had been their bane for a long time.

The Guru visited Lehal on Magh sudi 5, 1728 Bikram/24 January 1672 and stayed under a banyan tree by the side of a pond.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgpc.net/historical-gurdwaras/tegh.asp#3&lt;/ref&gt; The sickness in the village subsided. The site where Guru Tegh Bahadur had sat came to be known as Dukh Nivaran, literally meaning ''eradicator of suffering''. Devotees have faith in the healing qualities of water in the sarovar attached to the shrine.

Raja Amar Singh of Patiala (1748–82) had a garden laid out on the site as a memorial which he entrusted to [[Nihang]] Sikhs. Records of a court case in 1870 mention a Guru's garden and a Nihangs' well being in existence here.In 1920, during a survey for the proposed construction of [[Sirhind]]-[[Patiala]]-[[Jakhal]] railway line, it appeared that the banyan tree under which had sat Guru Tegh Bahadur would have to be removed. But men charged with felling it refused to touch it.

Ultimately, [[Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]] ordered cancellation of the entire project. No gurudwara building had, however, been raised. It was only in 1930 that a committee was formed to collect funds and commence construction and was completed twelve years later in the year 1942. [[Maharaja Yadavindra Singh]] who was a devout Sikh built the present building and sarovar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patialaonline.co.in/attraction.php#c1&lt;/ref&gt; The Gurdwara when completed passed under the administrative control of the Patiala state government. It was later transferred to the Dharam Arth Board of the [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union]] and eventually to the [[Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee]].

==Gurdwara Dukh Nivaran Sahib Complex==
[[File:Dukh Nivaran Sarovar.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The sarovar adjacent to Gurdwara Dukh Nivaran, Patiala'']]
[[File:Notice Board GDN.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Notice board depicting History of Gurdwara]]
The building complex sprawls over several acres. The two storey gateway has a collapsible iron gate and black and white marble floor. On the left of the pathway leading to the principal building is a small marble shrine marking the site where Guru Tegh Bahadur had sat under the [[banyan tree]]. The central two storey building, with a domed pavilion on top, is on a raised base having an octagonal domed chamber at each corner. The pinnacled lotus dome on top has a round sun-window on each side with a curved coping, projected horizontally at the ends. There are decorative domed pavilions at the corners and lotus blossoms in leaf in the middle on top of the walls.

The interior is paved with marble slabs in white and grey against black and white of the outer platform. The walls and pillars are also panelled with white marble slabs. The ceiling is decorated with stucco work in floral design. The [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is seated under a square canopy at the far end. The 75metre square sarovar, since considerably extended, is on the right and [[Guru ka Langar]] on the left as one enters. The Gurdwara is administered by the [[SGPC|Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]]. A big gathering is held on the fifth day of the light half of each [[lunar month]]. The festival of the year is [[Basant Panchmi]] which marks the day of Guru Tegh Bahadur's visit.

Chinese Banknotes, p.144. Shirjieh Publishers, Menlo Park, California&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification of this type of joss paper as "'''hell bank notes'''" or "hell money" is largely a [[Western culture|Western]] construct, since these items are simply regarded as yet another form of joss paper (冥幣, 陰司紙, 紙錢, or 金紙) in [[East Asia]]n cultures and have no special name or status.

==The name "hell"==
The word ''[[hell]]'' on hell bank notes refers to ''[[Diyu]]'' ({{zh|t=地獄|s=地狱|p=dìyù}}, "underworld prison"; also 地府, ''dìfǔ'', "underworld court"). These words are printed on some notes. In traditional Chinese belief, it is thought to be where the souls of the dead are first judged by the Lord of the Earthly Court, Yan Wang. After this particular judgement, they are either escorted to heaven or sent into the maze of underworld levels and chambers to atone for their sins. People believe that even in the earthly court, spirits need to use money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joelscoins.com/catpm.htm World Paper Money&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular story says that the word ''hell'' was introduced to China by [[Christian]] [[missionaries]], who preached that all non-Christian Chinese people would go to hell after death. The word "Hell" was thus misinterpreted to be the proper English term for the afterlife and hence adopted as such. Some printed notes attempt to correct this by omitting the word "hell" and sometimes replacing it with "heaven" or "paradise". These particular bills are usually found in [[Joss paper|joss]] packs meant to be burned for Chinese deities, and usually have the same design as hell bank notes but with different colours.

Earlier examples of these notes were issued in denominations of 5 and 10 yuan and upwards, with such amounts being considered adequate until inflation took hold within China from 1944. The soaring denominations of authentic currency was soon reflected in that issued for the afterlife, and after 1945 the majority of Hell banknotes were issued in denominations of $10,000 or higher. These earlier issues more commonly depict landscape scenes, temples or trains, and the numerous varieties may literally number into the millions.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ward &amp; Matravers, Brian (1970). Chinese Banknotes, p.144-145. Shirjieh Publishers, Menlo Park, California&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Hell bank notes are known for their large denominations, ranging from $10,000 to several billions. The obverse usually bears an effigy of the [[Jade Emperor]], the presiding monarch of heaven in [[Taoism]]; his signature, [[Romanization of Chinese|romanised]] as ''Yu Wong'' or ''Yuk Wong''; and the countersignature of [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yanluo, King of Hell]] (閻羅). There is usually an image of the Bank of Hell on the reverse of the notes.

A commonly sold Hell bank note is the $10,000 note that is styled after the old [[United States]] [[Federal Reserve Note]]. The obverse contains, apart from the portrait of the Jade Emperor, the seal of the Bank of Hell consisting of a picture of the bank itself. Many tiny, faint "Hell Bank Note"s are scattered on the back in yellow. These are sold in packs of 50 to 150, and are wrapped in [[cellophane]].

Stores that specialize in selling ritual items, such as the [[religious goods store]]s in [[Malaysia]], also sell larger and elaborately decorated notes that have a larger denomination than the usual $10,000 note. Some bills do not portray the Jade Emperor, and portray other famous figures from Chinese mythology instead, such as the [[Eight Immortals]], the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Yama]], or images of dragons.  Some even portray famous people who are deceased, such as US President [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]].

== Customs ==
When [[money burning|burning the notes]], the notes are placed as a loose bundle, in a manner considered respectful. Alternatively, in some customs, each bank note may be folded in a specific way before being tossed into the fire because of the belief that burning real money brings bad luck.

While the custom of burning "hell bank notes" remains legal in China, the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Civil Affairs]] has as of 2006 banned the practice of "vulgar" burnt-offerings for the deceased, which include paper "''luxury villas, sedan cars, mistresses, and other messy sacrificial items''", as well as [[Viagra]] and simulated models of "karaoke hostesses" and "Supergirls" based on the hit TV contest ''[[Super Girl (TV series)|Mongolian Cow Yoghurt Supergirl]]'', according to the Ministry, in effort to eradicate "[[feudal]]" and [[superstition|superstitious]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-04/25/content_576881.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The exact origin of Sufism is disputed. Some sources state that Sufism is the inner dimensions of the teachings of Muhammad whereas others say that Sufism emerged during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] from about the 8th to 10th centuries. However Islamic scholars predating the Islamic Golden Age were referred to as Sufis, like [[Hasan of Basra]]. According to [[Ibn Khaldun]] Sufism was already practiced by the [[Sahaba]], but with the spread of material tendencies, the term Sufi was just applied to those who emphasize the spiritual practice of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Gholamali Haddad Adel, Mohammad Jafar Elmi, Hassan Taromi-Rad ''Sufism: An Entry from Encyclopedia of the World of Islam'' EWI Press 2012 {{ISBN|978-1-908-43308-4}} page 3&lt;/ref&gt; 

Towards the end of the first millennium CE, a number of manuals began to be written summarizing the doctrines of Sufism and describing some typical [[Sufism#Devotional practices|Sufi practices]]. Two of the most notable are ''[[Kashf ul Mahjoob|Kashf al-Mahjûb]]'' (Revelation of the Veiled) of [[Hujwiri]], and ''Risâla'' (The Message) of [[Al-Qushayri]].&lt;ref&gt;The most recent version of the ''Risâla'' is the translation of Alexander Knysh, ''Al-Qushayri's Epistle on Sufism: Al-risala Al-qushayriyya Fi 'ilm Al-tasawwuf'' ({{ISBN|978-1859641866}}). Earlier translations include a partial version by Rabia Terri Harris (''Sufi Book of Spiritual Ascent'') and complete versions by Harris, and Barbara R. Von Schlegell.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the late medieval mystic [[Jami]], [[Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]] (died c. 716) was the first person to be called a "Sufi".&lt;ref name=exeg&gt;Rashid Ahmad Jullundhry, ''Qur'anic Exegesis in Classical Literature'', [[New Westminster]]: [[The Other Press]], 2010. {{ISBN|9789675062551}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two of [[Al-Ghazali|Al Ghazali]]'s greatest treatises, the "[[Al-Ghazali#The Revival of Religious Sciences|Revival of Religious Sciences]]" and the "[[Kimiya-yi sa'ādat|Alchemy of Happiness]]," argued that Sufism originated from the [[Quran|Qur'an]] and was thus compatible with mainstream Islamic thought, and did not in any way contradict Islamic Law—being instead necessary to its complete fulfillment. This became the mainstream position among Islamic scholars for centuries, challenged only recently on the basis of selective use of a limited body of texts {{Like what?|date=December 2010}}. Ongoing efforts by both traditionally trained Muslim scholars and Western academics are making Al-Ghazali's works available in English translation for the first time,&lt;ref&gt;Several sections of the ''Revival of Religious Sciences'' have been published in translation by the Islamic Texts Society; see http://www.fonsvitae.com/sufism.html. ''The Alchemy of Happiness'' has been published in a complete translation by Claud Field ({{ISBN|978-0935782288}}), and presents the argument of the much larger ''Revival of Religious Sciences'' in summary form.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing English-speaking readers to judge for themselves the compatibility of Islamic Law and Sufi doctrine.

All Sufi orders claim a direct chain of leadership to Muhammad, through Ali, with the exception of the Naqshbandis who claim a direct connection to Muhammad through Abu Bakr. In the eleventh century, Sufi orders (Tariqa) were instrumental in the institutional spread of Sufism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Tasawwuf [Sufism]|publisher=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World|year=2003|author=Carl W. Ernst|quote=The institutional spread of Sufism was accomplished through the “ways” or Sufi orders (see Tariqa), which increasingly from the eleventh century offered the prospect of spiritual community organized around charismatic teachers whose authority derived from a lineage going back to the Prophet Muhammad himself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim Spain===
Beginning in the 9th century and continuing throughout the 10th century, [[al-Andalus]] was home to fairly strict, orthodox beliefs and practices.&lt;ref name="Trimingham 1998 46"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trimingham|first=J. Spencer|title=The Sufi Orders in Islam|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Quranic studies and jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]) were the accepted and promoted types of scholarship that shaped the region’s beliefs and practices. Early [[fuqaha]] in Spain were somewhat skeptical of philosophical thought as well as of Sufism. In later centuries, especially the twelfth and thirteenth, Sufism became more accepted and somewhat assimilated into Andalusi Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarrano Ruano|first=Delfina|title=Why did the Scholars of al-Andalus distrust al-Ghazali?: Ibn Rushd’s al-Jadd’s Fatwa on Awliya-Allah.|journal=Der Islam: Zeitschrift fur Geschichte und Kultur des islamischen Orients|year=2006|volume=83|issue=1, 137-156|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars have generally seen this later flourishing in two different ways. For some, it reflects the influence of the mystical tradition in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Cordoba]] attributed to [[Ibn Masarra]].&lt;ref&gt;Maribel Fierro, "The Polemic about the 'Karamat al-awaliya' and the Development of Sufism in al-Andalus," ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' 55, no. 2 (1992), 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Others give exclusive credit to the influence of eastern mystics, most often including [[al-Ghazali|al-Ghazali's]] thoughts and teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Addas|first=Claude|title=The Legacy of Muslim Spain|year=1994|orig-year=909-936|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=911|authorlink=Andalusi Mysticism and the Rise of Ibn Arabi|editor=Salma Khadra Jayyusi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One figure in particular has often been credited as being the earliest introduction of Sufism to Spain: [[Ibn Masarra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marin|first=Manuela|title=The Legacy of Muslim Spain|year=1994, 878-894|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=890|authorlink=Muslim Religious Practices in al-Andalus (2nd/8th-4th/10th Centuries)|editor=Salma Khadra Jayyusi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He lived from 883 to 931 and was born outside of Cordoba. Many consider him to have established the first Sufi school in the province; however, his teachings were outside of the so-called "mainstream" Sufism that was more common in the East during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knysh|first=Alexander|title=Islamic Mysticism : a Short History|year=2000|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With Ibn Masarra there was a “brief flowering”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trimingham|first=J. Spencer|title=The Sufi Orders in Islam|year=1998|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of Sufism in Spain, and later Spanish Sufis reflected his influence on them. After Ibn Masarra’s death, in 940 his followers fell under heavy persecution under the jurists who destroyed Ibn Masarra's works and also forced his followers to recant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knysh|first=Alexander|title=Islamic Mysticism: a Short History|year=2000|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The effects of his thought and that of his disciples would appear again in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries amidst later Sufis such as Ibn Arabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Urvoy|first=Dominique|title=The Legacy of Muslim Spain|year=1994|orig-year=849-877|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=855|authorlink=The Ulama of al-Andalus|editor=Salma Khadra Jayyusi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the twelfth century, shifts towards the acceptance—or at least tolerance—of philosophy and Sufism into what had previously been strictly orthodox beliefs were occurring. Many people began to read and translate the works of philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. At the forefront of the philosophical movement in Spain were [[Ibn Bajjah]], [[Ibn Tufail]], [[Ibn Rushd]], and a Jewish scholar named [[Maimonides|Ibn Maimun]].&lt;ref name="Mackeen 1971 398–408"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackeen|first=A.M. Mohamed|title=The Early History of Sufism in the Maghrib Prior to Al-Shadhili (d. 656/1258)|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|year=1971|volume=91|issue=3|pages=398–408|doi=10.2307/600258}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Tufail]] introduced the element of Sufism into this philosophical way of thinking. Andalusi Sufism was at its peak at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fierro|first=Maribel|title=The Polemic about the ‘karamat al-awliya’ and the Development of Sufism in al-Andalus (Fourth/Tenth-Fifth-Eleventh Centuries)|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|year=1992|volume=55|issue=2|pages=236–249|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00004596}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also at this time, eastern Sufism was developing more as a communal movement, whereas that of the West (including in al-Andalus), it remained largely an individual pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Addas|first=Claude|title= The Legacy of Muslim Spain|year=1994|orig-year=909-936|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=910|authorlink=Andalusi Mysticism and the Rise of Ibn Arabi|editor=Salma Khadra Jayyusi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Sufi masters who defended the works of theosophists such as [[Ghazali]] and [[al-Qushayri]] began emerging in the late eleventh and early- to mid-twelfth centuries. [[Ibn al-Arif|Abu l-‘Abbas ibn al-‘Arif]] (1088-1141) was one of the most prominent Sufis in Spain and one of the earliest ones during Sufism's peak in the peninsula.&lt;ref name="Trimingham 1998 46"/&gt;  He belonged to what Spanish scholar of Islam, Miguel Asin Palacios, termed the "School of Almeria," so named for its geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cruz Hernandez|first=Miguel|title= The Legacy of Muslim Spain|year=1994, 777-803|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=780|authorlink=Andalusi Mysticism and the Rise of Ibn Arabi|editor=Salma Khadra Jayyusi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn al-Arif was one of the first to interpret Ghazali in the West, and he also founded a method of spiritual training called tariqah.&lt;ref name="Mackeen 1971 398–408"/&gt;  Ibn al-‘Arif's disciple [[Ibn Qasi]] set up a group of religious followers in Portugal and built a monastery in Silves. He authored the Khal al-Na’lain, which Ibn ‘Arabi would later write a commentary on.&lt;ref&gt;A.M Mohamed Mackeen, "The Early History of Sufism in the Maghrib Prior to Al-Shadhili" ''Journal of American Oriental Society'' 91, no 3 (1971): 403&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Barrajan]] (d. 1141), who a student and friend of Ibn al-‘Arif, lived and taught in Seville but was originally from North Africa, has been called the Ghazali of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Faure|first=A.|title=Ibn Barrad̲j̲ān|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ibn-barradjan-SIM_3106|work=Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition|publisher=Brill Online|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ibn Barrajan and Ibn al-‘Arif were both tried for heresy because their views conflicted with those of the Almoravids in power; however, Ibn Barrajan appears to have been more active in using Sufism as a means of challenging Quranic scholars and jurists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Urvoy|first=Dominique|title=The Legacy of Muslim Spain|year=1994, 849-877|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=864|authorlink=The Ulama of al-Andalus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Arabi]], another key figure of this period of Sufism in the region, was born in [[Murcia]] in 1165 at the beginning of the [[Almohad]] reign. He is one of the most important Sufis of Spain, although he--like many other Andalusi Sufis--would eventually leave the peninsula and travel throughout North Africa and the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knysh|first=Alexander|title=Islamic Mysticism: a Short History|year=2000|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works in Andalusia focused mainly on [[Al-Insān al-Kāmil|the perfect human individual]], monastic metaphysics, and mystical path to spiritual and intellectual perfection. Central themes of Ibn 'Arabi's were the unity of all beings, or “[[Sufi metaphysics|wahdat al-wujud]],” and also how God reflects God’s self in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knysh|first=Alexander|title=Islamic Mysticism: a Short History|year=2000|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ibn ‘Arabi, the main practices of Andalusi Sufis included ascesis, poverty, and devotion to the Qur’an.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Addas|first=Claude|title=The Legacy of Muslim Spain|year=1994, 909-936|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=928|authorlink=Andalusi Mysticism and the Rise of Ibn Arabi|editor=Salma Khadra Jayyusi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after the death of Ibn ‘Arabi, al-Andalus experienced a “spiritual aridity”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trimingham|first=J. Spencer|title=The Sufi Orders in Islam|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-fourteenth century. The one exception to that trend was [[Ibn Abbad al-Rundi]] (1332-1390), a member of the [[Shadhiliyya]] order who was born in [[Ronda]] and whose scholarship brought together mystical and juridical paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Honerkamp|first=Kenneth L.|title=Historia del sufismo en al-Andalus: Maestros sufies de al-Andalus y el Magreb|year=2009|publisher=Almuzara|location=Cordoba, Spain|pages=143–164|authorlink=Ibn Abbad of Ronda: His Influence in Andalusia and al-Magreb|editor=Amina Gonzalez Costa and Gracia Lopez Anguita}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work helped Sufism become more accepted within the [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Honerkamp|first=Kenneth L.|title=Historia del sufismo en al-Andalus: Maestros sufies de al-Andalus y el Magreb|year=2009|orig-year=143-164|publisher=Almuzara|location=Cordoba, Spain|pages=145, 163|authorlink=Ibn Abbad of Ronda: His Influence in Andalusia and al-Magreb|editor=Amina Gonzalez Costa and Gracia Lopez Anguita}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Sufism would no longer directly be a part of Andalusi life after the [[Catholic Monarchs]] expelled Muslims from Spain, in the Spanish Christian mystics of the sixteenth century, such as [[San Juan de la Cruz]] and [[Teresa of Avila]], many have seen Sufism’s lasting influence in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lopez-Baralt|first= Luce|title=The Legacy of Muslim Spain|year=1994, 505-554|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=530|authorlink=The Legacy of Islam in Spanish Literature|editor=Salma Khadra Jayyusi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==13th to 16th Centuries==
Between the 13th and 16th centuries CE, Sufism produced a flourishing intellectual culture throughout the Islamic world, a "Golden Age" whose physical artifacts are still present. In many places, a lodge (known variously as a ''[[zaouia]]'', ''[[khanqah]]'', or ''tekke'') would be endowed through a pious foundation in perpetuity (''[[waqf]]'') to provide a gathering place for Sufi adepts, as well as lodging for itinerant seekers of knowledge. The same system of endowments could also be used to pay for a complex of buildings, such as that surrounding the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]], including a lodge for Sufi seekers, a [[hospice]] with kitchens where these seekers could serve the poor and/or complete a period of initiation, a library, and other structures. No important domain in the civilization of Islam remained unaffected by Sufism in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Danner - "The Islamic Tradition: An introduction." Amity House. February 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufism was an important factor in the historical spread of Islam, and in the creation of regional Islamic cultures, especially in Africa&lt;ref&gt;For the pre-modern era, see Vincent J. Cornell, ''Realm of the Saint: Power and Authority in Moroccan Sufism'', {{ISBN|978-0-292-71209-6}}; and for the colonial era, Knut Vikyr, ''Sufi and Scholar on the Desert Edge: Muhammad B. Oali Al-Sanusi and His Brotherhood'', {{ISBN|978-0-8101-1226-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Asia. Recent academic work on these topics has focused on the role of Sufism in creating and propagating the culture of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] world, including a study of the various branches of the [[Naqshbandi]]&lt;ref&gt;Dina Le Gall, ''A Culture of Sufism: Naqshbandis in the Ottoman World, 1450-1700'', {{ISBN|978-0-7914-6245-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Khalwati]] orders,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John J. Curry, ''The Transformation of Muslim Mystical Thought in the Ottoman Empire: The Rise of the Halveti Order, 1350-1650'', {{ISBN|978-0-7486-3923-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in resisting European [[imperialism]] in North Africa and South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur F. Buehler, ''Sufi Heirs of the Prophet: The Indian Naqshbandiyya and the Rise of the Mediating Sufi Shaykh'', {{ISBN|978-1-57003-783-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread to India===
{{Further information|Sufism in India}}
[[File:Nizamuddin Dargah and Jamaat Khana Masjid, Delhi.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Nizamuddin Auliya]]'s tomb (right) and [[Jama'at Khana]] Masjid (background), at [[Nizamuddin Dargah]] complex, in [[Nizamuddin West]], [[Delhi]]]]
[[Islam in South Asia|Muslims of South Asia]] prominently follow the [[Chishti]]yya, [[Naqshbandiyyah]], [[Qadiriyyah]] and [[Suhrawardiyyah]] orders. Of them the Chishti order is the most visible.  Khwaja [[Moinuddin Chishti]], a disciple of Khwaja [[Usman Harooni]], the propounder of this order, introduced it in India. He came to India from [[Afghanistan]] with the army of Shihab-ud-Din Ghuri in 1192 AD and started living permanently in [[Ajmer]] from 1195. Centuries later, with the support of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers, his shrine became a place of pilgrimage. [[Akbar]] used to visit the shrine every year.{{Ref|Titus}} Some Sufis were not against absorbing ideas from [[Hinduism]] for their devotional songs with Sufism playing the primary role as a point of contact between Hinduism and Islam.{{Ref|Titus|189}} This conversion left many of those who converted via Sufism more Hindu in practice than Muslim.{{Ref|Titus|194}}

[[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] conquests in South Asia were accompanied by four Sufi mystics of the Chishtiyya order from Afghanistan: [[Moinuddin Chishti|Moinuddin]] (d. 1233 in Ajmer), [[Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki|Qutbuddin]] (d. 1236 in [[Delhi]]), [[Nizamuddin Auliya|Nizamuddin]] (d.1335 in [[Delhi]]) and [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar|Fariduddin]] (d.1265 in [[Pakpattan]] now in [[Pakistan]]) {{Ref|Claude}}. During the reign of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], who spread the [[Delhi sultanate]] towards the south, the Chistiyya spread its roots all across India.{{Ref|Claude}} The Sufi shine at Ajmer in [[Rajasthan]] and [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] in Delhi, [[Ashraf Jahangir Semnani]] in Kichaucha Shariff belong to this order.

The Suharawardi order was started by [[Abu al-Najib Suhrawardi]], a Persian Sufi born in Sohrevard near Zanjan in Iran, and brought to India by [[Baha-ud-din Zakariya]] of [[Multan]]. The [[Suhrawardiyyah]] order of Sufism gained popularity in [[Bengal]].{{Ref|ICCR}} In addition, the [[Suhrawardiyyah]] order, under the leadership of Abu Hafs Umar al-Suhrawardi (d. 1234), also bequeathed a number of teachings and institutions that were influential in shaping other order that emerged during later periods.

The [[Khalwati]] order was founded by Umar al-Khalwati, an [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] Sufi known for undertaking long solitary retreats in the wilderness of Azerbaijan and northwestern Iran. While the Indian Subcontinent branches of the order did not survive into modern times, the order later spread into the [[Ottoman Empire]] and became influential there after it came under persecution by the rise of the [[Safavid]] Shahs during the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[Qadiriyyah]] order founded by [[Abdul Qadir Gilani]] whose tomb is at Baghdad. It is popular among the Muslims of [[South India]].

[[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Baha-ud-Din Naqshband]] (1318-1389) of [[Turkestan]] founded [[Naqshbandi]] order of Sufism. [[Khwaja Baqi Billah|Khwaja Razi-ud-Din Muhammad Baqi Billah]] whose tomb is in Delhi, introduced the Naqshbandi order in India. The essence of this order was insistence on rigid adherence to Sharia and nurturing love for the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]. It was patronized by the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal rulers]], as its founder was their ancestral [[Pir (Sufism)|Pir]] (Spiritual guide). "The conquest of India by [[Babur]] in 1526 gave considerable impetus to the Naqshbandiyya order" {{Ref|Rizvi}}. Its disciples remained loyal to the throne because of the common [[Turkic peoples|Turkic origin]]. With the royal patronage of most of the Mughal rulers, the Naqshbandi order caused the revival of Islam in its pure form.

== Modern history ==

Current Sufi orders include [[Ba 'Alawiyya]], [[Chishti]], [[Khalwati]], [[Naqshbandi]], [[Ni'matullāhī|Nimatullahi]], Oveyssi, [[Qadria Noshahia]], Qadiria Boutshishia, [[Qadiriyyah]], [[Qalandariyya]], [[Sarwari Qadiri]], [[Shadhili|Shadhliyya]] and [[Suhrawardiyya]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Jamaat Tableegh and the Deobandis'' by Sajid Abdul Kayum, Chapter 1: Overview and Background.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufism is popular in such African countries as [[Morocco]] and  [[Senegal]], where it is seen as a mystical expression of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;"Sufism and Religious Brotherhoods in Senegal," Babou, Cheikh Anta, ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', v. 40 no1 (2007) p. 184-6&lt;/ref&gt; Sufism is traditional in Morocco but has seen a growing revival with the renewal of Sufism around contemporary spiritual teachers such as [[Hamza al Qâdiri al Boutchichi|Sidi Hamza al Qadiri al Boutshishi]]. Mbacke suggests that one reason Sufism has taken hold in Senegal is because it can accommodate local beliefs and customs, which tend toward the [[mystical]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sufism and Religious Brotherhoods in Senegal'', Khadim Mbacke, translated from the French by Eric Ross and edited by John Hunwick. Princeton, N.J.: Markus Wiener, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufism suffered setbacks in North Africa during the colonial period; the life of the Algerian Sufi master Emir [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al-Qadir]] is instructive in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular the biographical introduction to Michel Chodkiewicz, ''The Spiritual Writings of Amir Abd Al-Kader, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2446-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable as well are the lives of [[Amadou Bamba]] and Hajj [[Umar Tall]] in sub-Saharan Africa, and [[Sheikh Mansur]] Ushurma and [[Imam Shamil]] in the Caucasus region.

In the 20th century some more modernist Muslims have called Sufism a superstitious religion that holds back Islamic achievement in the fields of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2260?_hi=6&amp;_pos=2 From the article on Sufism in Oxford Islamic Studies Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of western [[converts to Islam]] have also embraced Sufism,{{fact|date=October 2017}} sometimes resulting in considerable [[syncretism]] or generic spiritualism detached from Islam, as in the case of "[[Universal Sufism]]" or the writings of  [[René Guénon]] or  [[G. I. Gurdjieff]].

One of the first to return to Europe as an official representative of a Sufi order, and with the specific purpose to spread Sufism in Western Europe, was the   [[Ivan Aguéli]].
Other noteworthy Sufi teachers who were active in the West include [[Bawa Muhaiyaddeen]], [[Inayat Khan]], [[Nazim Al-Haqqani]], [[Javad Nurbakhsh]], [[Bulent Rauf]], [[Irina Tweedie]], [[Idries Shah]] and [[Muzaffer Ozak]].

Currently active Sufi academics and publishers include [[Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee]], [[Nuh Ha Mim Keller]], [[Nooruddeen Durkee|Abdullah Nooruddeen Durkee]],  [[Abdal Hakim Murad]], [[Syed Waheed Ashraf]] and the Franco-Moroccan Faouzi Skali.

==Orientalism==
Orientalists proposed a variety of origin theories regarding Sufism, such as that it originated as an Aryan response to Semetic influence, Buddhism, Neo-Platonism, and [[Christian monasticism|Christian ascetism]] or [[Gnosticism]].&lt;ref name="nasr"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IgVtq3kNCrYC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=origins+of+tasawwuf#v=onepage&amp;q=origins%20of%20tasawwuf&amp;f=false |title=An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines |publisher= |accessdate=17 January 2015 |isbn=9780791415153 |author1=Nasr |first1=Seyyed Hossein Nasr |date=1993-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sedgwick ''Western Sufism: From the Abbasids to the New Age'' Oxford University Press 9780199977659 2016 p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Modern academics and scholars, however, have rejected early Orientalist theories asserting a non-Islamic origin of Sufism,&lt;ref name="carl1"&gt;{{citation|title=Tasawwuf [Sufism]|publisher=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World|year=2003|author=Carl W.

Indian classical dance is made from India and classical dance is played by various actors.

While the ''Natya Shastra'' is the revered ancient text in the Hindu tradition, there are numerous other ancient and medieval Sanskrit dance-drama related texts that further discuss and expand on the classical repertoire of performance arts, such as the ''[[Abhinaya Darpana]]'', ''Abhinaba Bharati'', ''Natya Darpana'', ''Bhava Prakasa'' and many others.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|pp=xxix, 131-137}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mandakranta Bose |title=Movement and Mimesis: The Idea of Dance in the Sanskritic Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JS_pCAAAQBAJ |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-011-3594-8 |pages=13–32, 108–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Ragini Devi|1990|pp=18-37}} The term "classical" ([[Sanskrit]]: "Shastriya") denotes the Natya Shastra-based performing arts.

All major classical Indian dance forms include in repertoire, three categories of performance in the ''Natya Shastra''. These are ''Nritta'', ''Nritya'' and ''Natya'':&lt;ref name=meduri1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meduri |first=Avanthi |title=Bharatha Natyam-What Are You? |journal=Asian Theatre Journal |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=1988 |pages=3–4 |doi=10.2307/1124019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ''Nritta'' performance is abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of the dance.&lt;ref name=koskoff955 /&gt; The viewer is presented with pure movement, wherein the emphasis is the beauty in motion, form, speed, range and pattern.&lt;ref name=meduri1 /&gt; This part of the repertoire has no interpretative aspect, no telling of story. It is a technical performance, and aims to engage the senses (prakriti) of the audience.&lt;ref name="Descutner2010p45"&gt;{{cite book |author=Janet Descutner |title=Asian Dance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8tCYjXOtkdgC |year=2010 |publisher=Infobase |isbn=978-1-4381-3078-1 |pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Nritya'' is slower and expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, storyline particularly with spiritual themes in Hindu dance traditions.&lt;ref name=koskoff955&gt;{{cite book |author=Ellen Koskoff |title=The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: The Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73MO0eiQD_EC&amp;pg=PA955 |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-99404-0 |pages=955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''nritya'', the dance-acting expands to include silent expression of words through gestures and body motion set to musical notes. The actor articulates a legend or a spiritual message. This part of the repertoire is more than sensory enjoyment, it aims to engage the emotions and mind of the viewer.&lt;ref name=meduri1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Descutner2010p45" /&gt;
* The ''Natyam'' is a play, typically a team performance,&lt;ref name=kjayakrishnan25&gt;Kavitha Jayakrishnan (2011), [https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/6356 Dancing Architecture: the parallel evolution of Bharatanātyam and South Indian Architecture], MA Thesis, Awarded by University of Waterloo, Canada, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; but can be acted out by a solo performer where the dancer uses certain standardized body movements to indicate a new character in the underlying story. A ''Natya'' incorporates the elements of a ''Nritya''.&lt;ref name=meduri1 /&gt;{{Sfn|Reginald Massey|2004|pp=33-38, 83-84, 207-214}}&lt;ref name="NettlStone1998p516"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bruno Nettl |author2=Ruth M. Stone |author3=James Porter et al |title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: South Asia : the Indian subcontinent |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&amp;pg=PA516 |year=1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-8240-4946-1 |pages=516–521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All classical dances of India used similar symbolism and rules of gestures in ''abhinaya'' (acting). The roots of ''abhinaya'' are found in the ''Natyashastra'' text which defines drama in verse 6.10 as that which aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor's art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a super sensual inner state of being.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} A performance art, asserts ''Natyashastra'', connects the artists and the audience through ''abhinaya'' (literally, "carrying to the spectators"), that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein the actors communicate to the audience, through song and music.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art to engage every aspect of life, in order to glorify and gift a state of joyful consciousness.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=5}}

The communication through symbols is in the form of expressive gestures (mudras or hastas) and pantomime set to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the ''ras'' (sentiment, emotional taste) and ''bhava'' (mood) of the underlying story.&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82" /&gt; In Hindu classical dances, the artist successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance:
* ''Angika'' (gestures and body language),
* ''Vachika'' (song, recitation, music and rhythm),
* ''Aharya'' (stage setting, costume, make up, jewelry),
* ''Sattvika'' (artist's mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist's inner and outer state resonates).&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Tanvi Bajaj |author2=Swasti Shrimali Vohra |title=Performing Arts and Therapeutic Implications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MRcCgAAQBAJ |year=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-32572-7 |pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Abhinaya'' draws out the ''[[bhava]]'' (mood, psychological states).&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82" /&gt;

[[File:Knadil.JPG|thumb|right|[[Diwali]] is a festival of lights; across India people celebrate it via symbolic diyas or kandils (colorful paper lanterns) as an integral part of Diwali decorations.]]
A '''kandeel''' is a [[lantern]] with a wooden framework and covered in coloured matte or glossy papers. These lanterns are generally hung in front of homes during the [[Hindu]] festival of lights, [[Diwali]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Kandeel in [[Sanskrit]] is known as ''akasha deepa'' (lantern of the sky), 'akash diwa' (sky light), and in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], Goodu Deepa (nested light), or Nakshatra Gudu (star-like nest).
Hindus in earlier days set kandeels afloat high, a gesture to invite the spirits of their ancestors moving around to come back home and be with them during the festival time; hence the name ''akasha deepa'' (lantern of the sky) or AkashaKandil.

In Kerala, especially in Fort Kochi, a city in Ernakulam District, it is known as akasha vilakku.  Hindu Vaishyas (Konkani-speaking linguistic minority of Kerala), who had skulked out from Goa during the Portuguese regime, dwelt in Kerala. During the Hindu lunar month of 'Kartika', the people use to put akasha deepam, colloquially known in Konkani dialect "Panjire", in place on roof tops of the houses and light them in the evening until dawn breaks in and up to the Karthika Paurnami (full moon) day or Dev Dewali day. Earlier oil lamps were used, which are fixed in the panjire (cage models), now colourful electrical lights are used instead. By lighting the panjiras it is believed that during Kartika those who had died used to visit their houses and wish their relatives wellbeing, or if the lights were not lit in front of the house, the curses them to live them in darkness in life.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:AkashaDeepa.jpg]] --&gt;
Kandeels are hung for around a month from the first day of Diwali. Kandeels are traditionally built in a crystal shape with tails at the bottom; shapes include stars, globes, delicate dotted designs, and simple drawings. Opaque papers cut into a complex design give more beauty to a Kandeel by blocking some of the light behind it.

'''Khushwant Singh''' (born '''Khushal Singh''', 15 August 1915 – 20 March 2014) was an [[Indian people|Indian]] [[author]], [[lawyer]], [[diplomat]], [[journalist]] and [[politician]]. His experience in the 1947 [[Partition of India]] inspired him to write ''[[Train to Pakistan]]'' in 1956 (made into [[Train to Pakistan (film)|film]] in 1998), which became his most well-known novel.&lt;ref name=sengupta&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sengupta|first1=Somini|title=Khushwant Singh, provocative Indian journalist, dies at 99|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/world/asia/khushwant-singh-provocative-indian-journalist-dies-at-99.html|accessdate=25 February 2018|work=The New York Times|date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dna"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Subramonian|first1=Surabhi|title=India's very own literary genius Khushwant Singh passes away, read his story|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-india-s-very-own-literary-genius-khushwant-singh-passes-away-read-his-story-1970779|accessdate=7 May 2015|work=dna|publisher=Diligent Media Corporation Ltd.|date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in Punjab, Khushwant Singh was educated in [[New Delhi]], and studied law at [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi|St. Stephen's College]], [[Delhi]], and [[King's College London]]. After working as a lawyer in Lahore Court for eight years, he joined the [[Indian Foreign Service]] upon the [[Independence of India|Independence of India from British Empire in 1947]]. He was appointed journalist in the [[All India Radio]] in 1951, and then moved to the Department of Mass Communications of [[UNESCO]] at Paris in 1956. These last two careers encouraged him to pursue a literary career. As a writer, he was best known for his trenchant secularism,&lt;ref name=timesofindia&gt;{{cite news|last=TNN|title=Khushwant Singh, journalist and writer, dies at 99|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Khushwant-Singh-journalist-and-writer-dies-at-99/articleshow/32352917.cms|accessdate=21 March 2014|newspaper=The Times of India|date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; humour, sarcasm and an abiding love of poetry. His comparisons of social and behaviour characteristics of Westerners and Indians are laced with acid wit. He served as the editor of several literary and news magazines, as well as two newspapers, through the 1970s and 1980s.

==Early life==

Khushwant Singh was born in [[Hadali]], [[Khushab District]], [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] (which now lies in Pakistan), in a [[Sikh]] family. He was the younger son of [[Sobha Singh (builder)|Sir Sobha Singh]] and Veeran Bai. Births and deaths were not recorded in his time, and for him his father simply made up 2 February 1915 for his school enrolment at [[Modern School, New Delhi]].&lt;ref name=rahul&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Rahul|editor1-last=Dharker|editor1-first=Anil|title=Icons: Men &amp; Women Who Shaped Today's India|date=2008|publisher=Lotus Collection, an imprint of Roli Books|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-7436-612-2|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sNFbBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT94&amp;lpg=PT94&amp;dq=khushwant+singh+15+august+1915&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ow9sS83uuw&amp;sig=cTXYWOIczXP4DF08-mz-XhjGU9I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjg1-rG9MDZAhVBMo8KHc6_Cec4ChDoAQhAMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=khushwant%20singh%2015%20august%201915&amp;f=false|chapter=The Man in the Light Bulb: Khushwant Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt; But his grandmother Lakshmi Bai asserted that he was born in August, so he later set the date for himself as 15 August.&lt;ref name=sengupta/&gt; Sobha Singh was a prominent builder in [[Lutyens' Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Ranjit|title=Sikh Achievers|year=2008|publisher=Hemkunt Publishers|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8-17-01036-53|page=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfuDnpVlmlcC&amp;pg}}&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle [[Sardar Ujjal Singh]] (1895–1983) was previously Governor of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].

His birth name, given by his grandmother, was Khushal Singh (meaning "Prosperous Lion"). He was called by a pet name "Shalee". At school his name earned him ridicule as other boys would mock at him with an expression, "Shalee Shoolie, Bagh dee Moolee" (meaning, "This shalee or shoolee is the radish of some garden.") He chose Khushwant so that it rhymes with his elder brother's name Bhagwant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singh|first1=Khushwant|title=The Kh Factor|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/the-kh-factor/210867|accessdate=7 May 2015|work=Outlook|date=19 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He declared that his new name was "self-manufactured and meaningless". But he later discovered that there was a Hindu physician with the same name, and the number subsequently increased.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singh|first1=Khushwant|title=DON’T WORRY, BE HAPPY|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061125/asp/opinion/story_7045213.asp|accessdate=7 May 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=25 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered Delhi Modern School in 1920 and studied there till 1930. There he met his future wife, Kawal Malik, one year his junior.&lt;ref name=rahul/&gt; He continued higher education at [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College, Lahore]], [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi|St. Stephen's College]] in [[Delhi]] and [[King's College London]], before reading for the Bar at the [[Inner Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Vinita Rani, "[http://mjpru.ac.in/PhdDetails/PhdEnglish/PhdData/Vinita.doc Style and Structure in the Short Stories of Khushwant Singh.

==Career==

Khushwant Singh started his professional career as a practising lawyer in 1939. He worked at Lahore Court for eight years. In 1947 he entered Indian Foreign Service for the newly independent India. He started as Information Officer of the Government of India in Toronto, Canada. He was Press Attaché and Public Officer for the Indian High Commission for four years in London and Ottawa. In 1951 he joined the All India Radio as a journalist.

==Politics==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kushwanth.jpg|13.1 KBpx|thumbnail|kushwanth]] --&gt;
From 1980 to 1986, Singh was a member of [[Rajya Sabha]], the upper house of the Indian parliament. He was awarded the [[Padma bhushan]] in 1974 for service to his country. In 1984, he returned the award in protest against [[Operation Blue Star|the siege of the Golden Temple]] by the Indian Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Indian government awarded Khushwant Singh the [[Padma Vibhushan]].

As a public figure, Singh was accused of favouring the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]], especially during the reign of [[Indira Gandhi]]. He was derisively called an 'establishment liberal'. Singh's faith in the Indian political system was shaken by the [[anti-Sikh riots]] that followed Indira Gandhi's assassination, in which major Congress politicians are alleged to be involved; but he remained resolutely positive on the promise of Indian democracy&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Khushwant, "Oh, That Other Hindu Riot of Passage," Outlook Magazine, November, 07, 2004, available at [http://www.countercurrents.org/comm-khushwantsing071104.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and worked via [[Citizen's Justice Committee]] floated by [[H. S. Phoolka]] who is a senior advocate of [[Delhi High Court]].

Singh was a votary of greater diplomatic relations with [[Israel]] at a time when India did not want to displease [[Arab]] nations where thousands of Indians found employment. He visited Israel in the 1970s and was impressed by its progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031018/windows/above.htm | title=THIS ABOVE ALL : When Israel was a distant dream | publisher=The Tribune | date=18 October 2003 | accessdate=27 March 2014 | author=Singh, Khushwant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Singh was married to Kawal Malik. Malik was his childhood friend who had moved to [[London]] earlier. They met again when he studied law at King's College London, and soon got married.&lt;ref name=dna/&gt; They had a son, named Rahul Singh, and a daughter, named Mala. His wife predeceased him in 2001.&lt;ref name="pti"/&gt; Actress [[Amrita Singh]] is the daughter of his brother Daljit Singh's son - Shavinder Singh and Rukhsana Sultana. He stayed in  "Sujan Singh Park", near [[Khan Market]] New Delhi, Delhi's first apartment complex, built by his father in 1945, and named after his grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Making history with brick and mortar |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Making-history-with-brick-and-mortar/Article1-745801.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121205200651/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Making-history-with-brick-and-mortar/Article1-745801.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 December 2012 |publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] |date=15 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandniece [[Tisca Chopra]] is a noted TV and Film Actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grandniece Tisca Chopra remembers granduncle Khushwant Singh|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/03/grandniece-tisca-chopra-remembers-granduncle-khushwant-singh/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious belief===

Singh was a self-proclaimed agnostic, as the title of his 2011 book ''Agnostic Khushwant: There is no God'' explicitly revealed. He was particularly against organised religion. He was evidently inclined towards atheism, as he said, "One can be a saintly person without believed in God and a detestable villain believing in him. In my personalised religion, There Is No God!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nayar|first=Aruti|title=Staring into The Abyss: Khushwant Singh's Personal Struggles With Organized Religion|url=http://www.sikhchic.com/books/staring_into_the_abyss_khushwant_singhs_personal_struggles_with_organized_religion|work=sikhchic.com|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also once said, "I don't believe in rebirth or in reincarnation, in the day of judgement or in heaven or hell. I accept the finality of death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khuswant|first=Singh|title=How To Live &amp; Die|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?266528|work=Outlook|date=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last book ''The Good, The Bad and The Ridiculous'' was published in October 2013, following which he retired from writing.&lt;ref name="bp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Veteran Writer and Novelist Khushwant Singh passes away at 99|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/03/veteran-writer-and-novelist-khushwant-singh-passes-away-at-99/|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was his continued critique of religion and especially its practice in India, including the critique of the clergy and priests. It earned a lot of acclaim in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tiwary|first=Akash|title=Khushwant Singh's demise bereaves India of its most articulate agnostic|url=http://www.avenuemail.in/opinion/columns/khushwant-singhs-demise-bereaves-india-articulate-agnostic/34757/|work=The Avenue Mail|accessdate=21 March 2014|date=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Singh died of natural causes on 20 March 2014 at his [[Delhi]] residence, at the age of 98. His death was mourned by many including the [[President of India|President]], [[Vice President of India|Vice-President]] and [[Prime Minister of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President, Prime Minister of India condole Khushwant Singh's Demise|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/03/president-prime-minister-of-india-condole-khushwant-singhs-demise/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by his son and daughter. He was cremated at Lodhi Crematorium in Delhi at 4 in the afternoon of the same day.&lt;ref name=timesofindia/&gt; During his lifetime, Khushwant Singh was keen on burial because he believed that with a burial we give back to the earth what we have taken. He had requested the management of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] if he could be buried in their cemetery. After initial agreement, they had proposed some conditions which were unacceptable to Singh, and hence the idea was later abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?266528 | title=Excerpt: How To Live &amp; Die | publisher=Outlook India | accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Hadali]], [[Khushab District]] in the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab Province]] of modern Pakistan, in 1915. According to his wishes, some of his ashes were brought and scattered in [[Hadali]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/1101851/train-to-pakistan-2014 Train to Pakistan : 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 he had already written his own obituary, included in his collection of short stories ''Posthumous.''  Under the headline "Sardar Khushwant Singh Dead", the text reads:

{{quote|We regret to announce the sudden death of Sardar Khushwant Singh at 6 pm last evening. He leaves behind a young widow, two infant children and a large number of friends and admirers.

He also prepared an epitaph for himself, which runs:
{{quote|Here lies one who spared neither man nor God; &lt;br/&gt; Waste not your tears on him, he was a sod; &lt;br/&gt;Writing nasty things he regarded as great fun; &lt;br/&gt;Thank the Lord he is dead, this son of a gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=PTI|title=Here lies one who spared neither man nor God: Khushwant's epitaph for himself|url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/here-lies-one-who-spared-neither-man-nor-god-khushwants-epitaph-for-himself/article5810085.ece|accessdate=7 May 2015|work=The Hindu|date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The gopuram's origins can be traced back to early structures of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] kings [[Pallavas]] and by the twelfth century under the [[Pandya]] rulers these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance, eventually overshadowing the inner sanctuary which became obscured from view by the gopuram's colossal size.&lt;ref name=mitchell&gt;{{cite book

A koil may have multiple gopurams, typically constructed into multiple walls in tiers around the main shrine.

Gopurams are widespread in south Indian temples, predominantly in [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''108 Vaishnavite Divya Desams: Divya desams in Pandya Nadu''. M. S. Ramesh, Tirumalai-Tirupati Devasthanam.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tallest ''Vimana''==
''[[Vimana (architectural feature)|Vimanas]]'' are structures over the sanctum of temples, predominantly in [[Orissa, India|Odisha]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  In Odia/Kalinga style of architecture, Vimana is the sanctum sanctorum/ Garbhagruha of the temple housing the main deities and they are the tallest part of the entire temple. In many cases the ''[[Vimana (architectural feature)|vimanams]]'' are confused with ''[[gopuram]]s''.  In Tamil Nadu, ''[[Vimana (architectural feature)|Vimanams]]'' are present above the [[Garbhagriha|Garbhagruha]] or [[Sanctum sanctorum]] in of a Hindu temple and will be relatively smaller in size compared to the gopurams, which are usually present at the entrance of the temple.

| The Vimana with its recessed corners and upward movement presents a striking contrast to the straight-sided pyramidal tower of Thanjavur but with octagon shape of Dravidian architecture. As it rises to a height of 182 feet (55 m) and is shorter than the Thanjavur tower with larger plinth, it is often described as the feminine counterpart of the Thanjavur temple.

The Vimana is flanked on either side by small temples; the one in the north now housing the Goddess is fairly well preserved. The small shrine of Chandikesvara is near the steps in the north. In the north-east are a shire housing Durga, a well called lion-well (simhakeni) with a lion figure guarding its steps and a late mandapa housing the office. Nandi is in the east facing the main shrine. In the same direction is the ruined gopura, the entrance tower. The main tower surrounded by little shrines truly presents the appearance of a great Chakravarti (emperor) surrounded by chieftains and vassals. The Gangaikondacholapuram Vimana is undoubtedly a devalaya chakravarti, an emperor among temples of South India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

It is a stunning monument of religious (Brahmanical) [[kalinga architecture]]. The large structure seen today is actually the mantapa (mandap). Of the main tower, which once stood in the front, only the remains can be seen. This tower (deul) was perhaps 230&amp;nbsp;feet (70&amp;nbsp;meters) tall, higher than any other temple in India.

The '''Maison Carrée''' ({{IPA-fr|mɛzɔ̃ kaʁe}}; French for "square house") is an ancient building in [[Nîmes]], southern [[France]]; it is one of the best preserved [[Roman temple]] façades to be found in the territory of the former [[Roman Empire]].

== History ==
[[File:Acta Eruditorum - I iscrizioni, 1760 – BEIC 13444805.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of critique of ''Dissertation sur l'ancienne inscription de la Maison-Carrée de Nismes'' published in [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1760]]
In about 4-7 AD,&lt;ref&gt;The date is based on an unrecorded tour of the province by [[Augustus]] in 16 BC. James C. Anderson, Jr., "Anachronism in the Roman Architecture of Gaul: The Date of the Maison Carrée at Nîmes" ''The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'', '''60'''.1 (March 2001), pp. 68-79.&lt;/ref&gt; the Maison carrée was dedicated or rededicated to [[Gaius Caesar]] and [[Lucius Caesar]], grandsons and adopted heirs of [[Augustus]] who both died young. The inscription dedicating the temple to Gaius and Lucius was removed in [[medieval]] times.  However, a local scholar, [[Jean-François Séguier]], was able to reconstruct the inscription in 1758 from the order and number of the holes on the front [[frieze]] and [[architrave]], to which the bronze letters had been affixed by projecting tines.  According to Séguier's reconstruction, the text of the dedication read (in translation): "To Gaius Caesar, son of Augustus, Consul; to Lucius Caesar, son of Augustus, Consul designate; to the princes of youth."&lt;ref&gt;Séguier's reconstruction was published in [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|''CIL'']], xii. 3156, and, slightly revised, was confirmed in Robert Amy and Pierre Gros, ''La Maison Carrée de Nîmes'' (Paris, 1979), the standard modern comprehensive monograph; anomalies in the reconstructions, which cast doubt on the temple's date and therefore on the chronology of much Gallo-Roman architecture dated by comparisons, are presented in Anderson 2001; Anderson suggests a date for the present rebuilt temple in the first half of the 2nd century AD.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century the temple slowly began to recover its original splendour, due to the efforts of Victor Grangent.

== Architecture ==
[[File:MaisonCarréeFace.JPG|thumb|Front view]]
The Maison Carrée is an example of [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;A comparable podium temple of the Augustan period, "strikingly similar in decoration and in proportions" (Anderson 2001:72) still stands at [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Raised on a 2.85 m high podium, the temple dominated the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] of the Roman city, forming a rectangle almost twice as long as it is wide, measuring 26.42 m by 13.54 m.  The [[facade|façade]] is dominated by a deep [[portico]] or [[pronaos]] almost a third of the building's length.  It is a [[hexastyle]] design with six [[Corinthian order|Corinthian columns]] under the [[pediment]] at either end,&lt;ref&gt;The colonnade is returned at either side, so that beneath the portico there are ten columns in all.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pseudoperipteral]] in that twenty [[engaged column]]s are embedded along the walls of the [[cella]].  Above the columns, the architrave is divided by two recessed rows of petrified water drips into three levels with ratios of 1:2:3.  [[Egg-and-dart]] decoration divides the architrave from the frieze.  On three sides the frieze is decorated with fine ornamental relief carvings of rosettes and [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus leaves]] beneath a row of very fine [[dentil]]s.

A large door (6.87 m high by 3.27 m wide) leads to the surprisingly small and windowless interior, where the shrine was originally housed. This is now used to house a tourist oriented [[3-D film|film]] on the Roman history of Nîmes. No ancient decoration remains inside the cella.

== Restorations ==
The building has undergone extensive restoration over the centuries.  Until the 19th century, it formed part of a larger complex of adjoining buildings.  These were demolished when the Maison Carrée housed what is now the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nîmes]] (from 1821 to 1907), restoring it to the isolation it would have enjoyed in Roman times.  The pronaos was restored in the early part of the 19th century when a new ceiling was provided, designed in the Roman style.  The present door was made in 1824.

It underwent a further restoration between 1988–1992, during which time it was re-roofed and the square around it was cleared, revealing the outlines of the forum.  [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Sir Norman Foster]] was commissioned to build a modern art gallery and public library, known as the [[Carré d'Art]], on the far side of the square, to replace the city theater of Nîmes, which had burnt in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Pinon, "Le projet de Norman Foster pour la médiathèque de Nîmes face à la Maison Carrée", ''Archaeology'', 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  This provides a startling contrast to the Maison Carrée but renders many of its features, such as the portico and columns, in steel and glass.  The contrast of its modernity is thus muted by the physical resemblance between the two buildings, representing architectural styles 2000 years apart.

The Maison Carrée inspired the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Église de la Madeleine]] in [[Paris]], St. Marcellinus Church in [[Rogalin]], [[Poland]], and in the United States the [[Virginia State Capitol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Leland M. | last=Roth | year=1993 | title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History and Meaning | edition=First | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, Colorado | isbn=0-06-430158-3 | page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was designed by [[Thomas Jefferson]], who had a stucco model made of the Maison Carrée while he was minister to France in 1785.&lt;ref&gt;J.-C.

The '''Marriage Laws Amendment Bill''' is a [[Bill (law)|Bill]] that was first introduced in the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]] in 2010. It proposes changes to the [[Hindu Marriage Act|Hindu Marriage Act, 1955]] and [[Special Marriage Act, 1954]]. Both acts has a provision for [[divorce]] by mutual consensus of both the parties. The amendment of the marriage laws propose '[[Irreconcilable differences|irretrievable breakdown]]' as an additional ground for seeking divorce. Under this provision any marriage party could file a petition for divorce. It is supposed to make divorce laws women friendly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3674">'''Meir bar Hiyya Rofe''' (17th century; the ''Encyclopedia Judaica'' article gives the years of 1610 and 1690 as the possible years of birth and death respectively) was a [[Hebron]] [[rabbi]], known among other things for his tours of Europe as an emissary from the Holy Land on behalf of the Jewish community of Hebron.&lt;ref name="IsraelMéchoulan1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Manasseh ben Israel|author2=Henry Méchoulan|author3=Gérard Nahon|title=The hope of Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hp5tAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2 May 2011|date=May 1987|publisher=Published for the Littman Library by Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-710054-7|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Hiyya Rofe]], was a very learned rabbi from [[Safed]]. Orphaned at a young age, Meir studied in Hebron, leaving about 1648 as an emissary to Italy, Holland, and Germany. On his return journey, he stayed for two years in Italy to publish ''Ma'aseh Ḥiyya'' (Venice, 1652), his father's talmudic novellae and responsa. In Amsterdam he had influenced the wealthy [[Abraham Israel Pereyra|Abraham Pereyra]] to found a ''[[yeshiva]]'' in Hebron to be called ''Hesed le-Avraham'', of which Meir himself became the head scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Yaari, Avraham. "Meir ben Ḥiyya Rofe." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. 2nd ed. Vol. 13. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 783-784. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 4 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meir was in Gaza in 1665 when [[Nathan of Gaza]] began to prophecy on the messianism of [[Sabbatai Zevi]]. In a subsequent letter to Amsterdam, to Abraham Pereyra, he wrote that "Nathan of Gaza is a wise man fit for the divine presence to rest upon him," and urged Pereyra to come to Gaza. Pereyra reached Venice, but returned to Holland. Meir maintained his belief even after Sabbatai's conversion in 1666. In 1672 Meir left, again as an emissary of Hebron, for Turkey. He stayed for a time in Adrianople, where he was in contact with Sabbatai. On Sabbatai's exile to Albania in 1673, Meir returned to Gaza where he stayed with Nathan and even copied his writings for his own use. He then traveled again to Italy, and from 1675 to 1678 resided in the home of the Sabbatean [[Abraham Rovigo]] in [[Modena]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, Gershom, ''Sabbatai Sevi: The Mystical Messiah: 1626–1676'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1973, p. 887, states that Meir Rofe of Hebron had left Palestine together with [[Nathan of Gaza]] in 1666, and that he was "a member of Nathan's intimate circle in Adrianople..." Both Nathan and Abraham Rovigo were known Kabbalists, as was Rofe's father who studied Kabbalah with Hayyim Vital in Safed, where Rofe was born.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his stay in Italy Meir did much to encourage those who believed in Sabbatai Zevi and spread the writings of Nathan of Gaza. During the last ten years of his life he was recognized as the outstanding scholar of Hebron.

Meir Rofe persisted in his Sabbatean faith long after Sabbatai's apostasy, and even after Sabbatai's death.&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, ''Sabbatai Sevi'', p. 888.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholem also mentions in several places the correspondence about Sabbatean affairs he maintained with Abraham Rovigo between the years 1674 and 1678 as a very important source for the history of the Sabbatean movement.&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, ''Sabbatai Sevi'', p. 771. This correspondence was published by Isaiah Tishby in ''Sefunoth'', III-IV (1960), pp. 71-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nagyharsány''' ({{Lang-hr|Aršanj}}) is a village in [[Baranya (county)|Baranya]] county, [[Hungary]], near to the [[Croatia]]n border.

==The dispute of Nagyharsány==
In 1574 there was a religious dispute in Nagyharsány between the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] preacher, [[György Alvinczi]], and the followers of [[Calvinism]]. Alvinczi was condemned to death and killed by his opponents.

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities wanted to punish the Calvinist community for this deed, and sentenced those guilty to death. In a gesture of compassion, [[György Válaszúti]], the Unitarian preacher of [[Pécs]] begged for their pardon - and the [[Beylerbey]] of [[Buda]] agreed to have them set free.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1753">In [[Greek Mythology]], the '''Nysiads''' or '''Nysiades''' (Νυσιάδες) were [[Oceanid|Okeanid]] [[nymph]]s of mythical [[Nysa (mythology)|Mount Nysa]]. Zeus entrusted the infant god [[Dionysus]]&lt;ref&gt;Homeric Hymn 26 to Dionysus 2 ff&lt;/ref&gt; to their care, and the Nysiads raised him with the assistance of the old satyr-god [[Silenus|Seilenos]]. When Dionysus was grown the Nysiads joined his company as the first of the [[Maenad|Bakkhantes]].

== Names ==
The names of the nymphs include:&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 182&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ambrosia
* [[Arsinoe (Greek mythology)|Arsinoe]]
* Bromia or Bromis
* Cisseis
* [[Coronis (mythology)|Coronis]]
* [[Erato (mythology)|Erato]]
* Eriphia
* Nysa&lt;ref&gt;Also occurs in [[Terpander]], Fragment 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[Diodorus Siculus]]' ''Library of History'', 3. 69, she is called daughter of [[Aristaeus]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pedile
* Polymno or Polyhymno

Also mentioned are [[Kallichore (mythology)|Callichore]] and [[Calyce (mythology)|Calyce]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', 14. 219 ff&lt;/ref&gt; (after whom two moons of [[Jupiter]], [[Kallichore (moon)|Kallichore]] and [[Kalyke (moon)|Kalyke]], are named).

In later tellings of Dionysus's infancy, the Nysiades appear to be identified with the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]].&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3. 4. 3, the identification is explicit: "...the Nymphai of Asian Nysa, whom Zeus in later times placed among the stars and named the Hyades."&lt;/ref&gt; The term might have been used for the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiades]] and the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]] as Dionysus's tutors altogether.

'''Operation Woodrose''' was a military operation carried out by the [[Indira Gandhi]]-led [[Government of India|Indian government]] in the months after [[Operation Blue Star]] to "prevent the outbreak of widespread public protest" in the state of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|last=Deol|first=Harnik|title=Religion and nationalism in India: the case of the Punjab|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKRP1-H8T8AC|accessdate=22 July 2011|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-20108-7|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government arrested all prominent members of the largest Sikh political party, the [[Akali Dal]], and banned the [[All India Sikh Students Federation]], a large students' union.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In addition, the Indian Army conducted operations in the countryside during which thousands of Sikhs, overwhelmingly young men, were detained for interrogation and subsequently tortured.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Despite its purported success in controlling the armed insurgency in the Punjab region, the operation was criticized by human-rights groups for the suspension of civil liberties and [[habeas corpus]], resulting in the disappearances of thousands of Sikh men. After the operation, the central government was criticized for using "draconian legislation" to repress a minority community.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Conduct of the operation==
{{main article|Punjab Insurgency}}
The operation consisted of the rounding up of thousands of Sikh youth, including several presumably innocent civilians. According to estimates published by Inderjit Singh Jaijee, approximately 1 million individuals were reported as missing or killed as a result of Army operations during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Politics of genocide: Punjab, 1984-1994 |last=Jaijee |first=Inderjit Singh |year=1995 |publisher=[[The University of Michigan]] |page=216 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2-qGAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=woodrose+sikh&amp;q=woodrose }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr.Sangat Singh, Joint Intelligence Committee, about 100,000 youth had been taken into custody within first four to six weeks of the operation and he adds that many of them were not heard of again.&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;Sangat Singh, Sikhs in history, page 384&lt;/ref&gt; He further adds about 20,000 youth crossing over to Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt;

==Punjab-Chandigarh Disturbed Area Act (1983) and other measures==
To allow for the legality of the operation, the states of Punjab and Chandigarh had been declared by the Indian government as 'disturbed areas' by the enactment of the Punjab Chandigarh Disturbed Area Act 1983,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalindia.in/the-chandigarh-disturbed-areas-act-1983 THE CHANDIGARH DISTURBED AREAS ACT, 1983 : Legal India :: Legal India : Law Information Portal of India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while the Army was given unprecedented powers to detain and arrest civilians by the enactment of the Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Act 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/armsact.htm [The&amp;#93; Armed Forces (Punjab And Chandigarh)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The act empowered any commissioned, warrant or non-commissioned officer of the Army if "of opinion that it is necessary so to do for the maintenance of public order, after giving such due warning as he may consider necessary, fire upon or otherwise use forces, even to the causing of death". The act also allowed such an officer to "arrest, without warrant, any person who has committed a cognizable offence or against whom a reasonable suspicion exists that he has committed or is about to commit a cognizable offence".

Fast Track courts were set up under the Terrorist Affected Areas (Special Courts) Act 1984 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/document/actandordinances/terroristaffectedact.htm Terrorist Affected Areas (Special Courts) Act 1984&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to try to sentence suspected terrorists rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The gallant defender |last=Darshi |first=A R |year=1999 |publisher=[[Sikh Students Federation]] |isbn=81-7601-468-0 |page=108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
Punjab Chief of Police, K. P. S. Gill described the actions as "suffering from all the classical defects of army intervention in civil strife" and stated that the Indian Army had acted "blindly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Democracy and counterterrorism: lessons from the past |last=Art |first=Robert J. |year=2007 |publisher=[[United States Institute of Peace]] |isbn=1-929223-93-5 |page=441 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The army operations were overseen by General Jamwal, who was assigned the responsibility to seal the international border with Pakistan, in an attempt to control smuggling of arms and personnel, and by Gl R.S. Dayal, who was instructed to oversee the apprehension of militants in state of Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Politics of genocide: Punjab, 1984-1998 |last=Jaijee |first=Inderjit Singh |year=1999 |publisher=[[Ajanta Publications]] |isbn=978-81-202-0415-7 |page=72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="930">'''Pharnaces II''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 430 BCE - 422 BCE) ruled the satrapy of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]] under the [[Achaemenid Dynasty]] of [[Persia]]. Hellespontine Phrygia (Greek: Ἑλλησποντιακὴ Φρυγία) comprised the lands of [[Troad]], Mysia and [[Bithynia]] and had its seat at Daskyleion, south of [[Cyzicus]], [[Mysia]] (near modern-day [[Erdek]], Balıkesir Province, Turkey).

His grandfather, [[Artabazos I of Phrygia]], was the founder of the Pharnacid dynasty. Pharnaces II followed as satrap either upon the death of his father, [[Pharnabazus I]], or directly upon the death of his grandfather.  He was succeeded by his son [[Pharnabazus II]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1945">'''Qingxu Daode Zhenju''' ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]: 清虛道德真君; [[Pinyin]]: Qīngxū Dàodé Zhēnjūn) a character featured within the famed classic Chinese novel ''[[Investiture of the Gods]]''.

Daode Zhenjun is the renowned superiorman of Mount Green Top, Purple Cave. At one point in time during the [[Yang Ren]] incident, Zhenjun would realize that Yang Ren's time is not yet over, and he thus needs to exist for a longer period of time. Due to this, Insouciant{{clarify|date=July 2016}} would unleash his Yellow Kerchiefed Genie to scoop up Yang Ren and effectively bring him to his mountain by creating a large dust storm. Next, Insouciant would place a set amount of magic on both of Yang Ren's eyes (because Yang Ren previously had his eyes removed as punishment by [[King Zhou of Shang]]). Following this, Zhenjun would blow on Yang Ren's face and tell him to awaken. Following this point, Zhenjun would have Yang Ren as his disciple for the remainder of his allotted time.

When [[Huang Feihu]] had been completely surrounded by [[Wen Zhong (Shang Dynasty)|Wen Zhong]]'s forces, Zhenjun would engulf Huang and his entourage in a sleep-inducing fog and would then move them outside the valley. As seen following this, Zhenjun has the ability to create clone forms of any individual at will (due to his magic gourd). Some time later when Huang had been struck in the arm by [[Chen Tong]]'s magical dart, Zhenjun would summon his disciple, [[Huang Tianhua]], and tell him to quickly save his father—who is in difficulty. Before the leave of his disciple, Zhenjun would first hand Tianhua a flower basket, his Non-Evil Sword, and tell him to hurry back once his objective is completed.

'''Ruse''' (also transliterated as '''Rousse''', '''Russe'''; {{lang-bg|Русе}}, {{IPA-mk|ˈrusɛ|pron}}) is the [[List of cities and towns in Bulgaria|fifth largest city]] in [[Bulgaria]]. Ruse is in the northeastern part of the country, on the right bank of the [[Danube]], opposite the Romanian city of [[Giurgiu]], approximately {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]'s capital, {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} from the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]] and {{convert|300|km|0|abbr=on}} from the capital [[Sofia]]. It is the most significant Bulgarian river port, serving an important part of the international trade of the country.

Ruse is known for its 19th- and 20th-century [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]] and [[historicism|Neo-Rococo]] architecture, which attracts many tourists. It is often called the [[Vienna|Little Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bnr.bg/RadioBulgaria/Emission_English/Theme_Bulgaria_And_The_World/Material/neigbourly1201.htm|title=Neighborly: Balkan developments|last=Martinov|first=Krassimir|author2=Daniela Konstantinova|date=2007-01-12|publisher=[[Radio Bulgaria]]|accessdate=2008-12-27|quote=… Ruse’s image as The Little Vienna: a name given to the Bulgarian city for its wonderful architecture.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325234834/http://www.bnr.bg/RadioBulgaria/Emission_English/Theme_Bulgaria_And_The_World/Material/neigbourly1201.htm|archivedate=25 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=76796|title=Little Vienna Under the Bridge|date=2007-02-16|publisher=Sofia News Agency|accessdate=2008-12-27|quote=Rousse's architecture inspires locals to call it the "Little Vienna".}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Giurgiu-Rousse Friendship Bridge|Ruse-Giurgiu Friendship Bridge]], until 14 June 2013 the only one in the shared Bulgarian-Romanian section of the Danube, crosses the river here.

Ruse is the birthplace of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate in Literature]] [[Elias Canetti]] and the world-famous writer [[Michael Arlen]].

Ruse is on the right bank of the river Danube, which is the high bank, having two underwater terraces and three [[river terrace]]s at {{convert|15|to(-)|22|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}, {{convert|30|to(-)|66|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}, and {{convert|54|to(-)|65|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}. The average altitude is {{convert|45.5|m|2|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|AMSL]]. The urban area is an approximately 11-km ellipse running along the river. The city extends from the land-connected Matey ({{lang|bg|Матей}}) island and the mouth of [[Rusenski Lom]] on the west to Srabcheto ({{lang|bg|Сръбчето}}) hill on the east. During the 20th century, the west end of the city was significantly modified by moving the mouth of [[Rusenski Lom]] to the west, as well as by moving the bank itself with its fairway considerably to the north. Sarabair ({{lang|bg|саръбаир}})&lt;!--Turkish?--&gt; hill is to the south of the city and is {{convert|159|m|2|abbr=on}} high. The [[Rousse TV Tower]] is built there on the remains of Leventtabia, a former Turkish fortification.

== Climate ==


Ruse has a continental climate ([[Köppen climate classification#GROUP D: Continental.2Fmicrothermal climate|Köppen climate classification Dfb]]) with very hot summers and relatively cold winters. Owing to its position on the Danubian Plain, the city's winters can get windy.

Winter temperatures often dip below {{convert|0|°C|0}}, sometimes even to {{convert|-20|°C|0}}. In summer, the average temperature is {{convert|25|°C|0}}. Temperatures frequently reach {{convert|35|to|40|C|F}} in mid-summer in the city centre and stay as low as {{convert|18|to|20|C|F}} during the nights. During spring and autumn, daytime temperatures vary between {{convert|17|to|22|C|F}}, and precipitation during this time tends to be higher than in summer, with more frequent yet milder periods of rain. The highest temperature recorded was 44.0 C and the lowest was −22.8 C.

== History ==
[[File:Rousse-Roman-inscription.JPG|left|thumb|250px|An inscription from the Sexaginta Prista fortress]]

=== Etymology ===
Scholars suggest that the city on the river bank derived its present name from the Finnish root ''ruskea'' meaning "brown", or ''*ru-'' ("river", "stream") or from the [[Cherven (fortress)|Cherven fortress]], meaning "red," through the root ''rous'', which is present in many [[Slavic languages]].

A popular legend claims that the name ''Ruse'' comes from Finnish ruskea, or the name of a female founder of the city, whose name was Rusa, meaning "brown hair". In the 13th and 14th centuries, during the time of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], a fortified settlement called ''Rusi'', first mentioned in 1380, emerged near the ruins of the earlier Roman town.

Other theories include settlement by people from [[Ruthenia]]; a connection to the village of [[Rusokastro]] in Burgas Province; an unattested tribe of [[Getae]] with a name such as ''Riusi'', or; the pagan festival of [[Rosalia (festival)|Rosalia]].&lt;ref name=rousse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumruse.com/rusehistory/rusename_bg.htm |title=История на Русе |publisher=Регионален исторически музей{{mdash}}Русе |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=2008-09-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080610180850/http://www.museumruse.com/rusehistory/rusename_bg.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antiquity ===
The city emerged from a [[Neolithic]] settlement of the [[3rd millennium BC|3rd]] to 2nd millennium BCE, when pottery, fishing, agriculture, and hunting developed. Excavations have revealed several layers, suggesting that the place was attacked by neighbouring tribes and suffered from natural disasters. Ancient sanctuaries were found nearby, where idols of a pregnant woman, a fertility goddess, were prevalent.

The later [[Thracians|Thracian]] settlement developed into a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] military and naval centre during the reign of [[Vespasian]] (69–70 CE), as part of the fortification system along the northern boundary of [[Moesia]]. Its name, ''Sexaginta Prista'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bulgarian-monuments.com/view/Roman_fortress_Sexaginta_Prista|title=Bulgarian Monuments – Roman fortress Sexaginta Prista|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623230945/http://www.bulgarian-monuments.com/view/Roman_fortress_Sexaginta_Prista|archivedate=23 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests a meaning of "a city of 60 ships" (from {{lang-la|sexaginta}}&amp;nbsp;— "60" and {{lang-el|script=latn|pristis}}&amp;nbsp;— a special type of guard ship), based on the supposed 60 nearby [[Berth (moorings)|berths]].

The fortress was on the main road between [[Singidunum]] (modern [[Belgrade]]) and the [[Danube Delta]] and was destroyed in the 6th century by [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] raids. [[Hungary|Hungarian]] historian [[Felix Philipp Kanitz]] was the first to identify Sexaginta Prista with Ruse, but the Škorpil brothers demonstrated the link later through studying inscriptions, coins, graves, and objects of daily life. An inscription from the reign of [[Diocletian]] proves that the city was rebuilt as a ''praesidium'' (a large fortification) after it was destroyed by the [[Goths]] in 250 CE.

The settlement was mentioned as ''Golyamo Yorgovo'' in the Middle Ages, whose present successor is [[Giurgiu]] in [[Romania]].

=== Ottoman rule ===
[[File:Rousse panoramic 1824.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of Ruse in 1824]]

During [[History of Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman rule]], the invaders destroyed the town, reacting to a 1595 unsuccessful liberation attempt by a joint [[Vlach]]-Bulgarian army, led by [[Michael the Brave]]. After its rebuilding in the following years, Ruse was dubbed ''Rusçuk'' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]] for "little Ruse") and had again expanded into a large fortress by the 18th century. It later grew into one of the most important Ottoman towns on the Danube and an administrative centre of [[Tuna Vilayet]], which extended from [[Varna]] and [[Tulcea]] to Sofia and [[Niš]].

The ''Dunav'' newspaper appeared — it was the first printed in Bulgaria and in Bulgarian. Some Bulgarian schools were founded. The streets are renamed and numbered for the first time in Bulgarian lands. A post office, hospital, home for the aged were founded. Three empires met here for trading: [[Austro-Hungary]], Russia, [[British Empire]]. France and Italy opened consulates in Ruschuk. The modern city arose from the shades of the settlement. In 1865 the Obraztsov Chiflik was founded on the place where the English Consul's farm was; it was the first modern farm on the territory of the whole [[Ottoman Empire]] of that time.

Ruse developed into a centre of the [[Bulgarian National Revival]] and hosted the headquarters of the [[Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee]].

=== Early Modern Bulgaria ===

[[File:Girdap Bank Ruse Bulgaria pre-1913.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The first private bank in Bulgaria — „Girdap"]]

After it became part of modern Bulgaria on 20 February 1878, Ruse was one of the key cultural and economic centres of the country. Intensive building during the period changed the city's architectural appearance to a typical [[Central Europe]]an one. Ruse is famous for the many first innovations in Bulgaria, including:

[[File:Konsulstva-ruse.png|Official seals of foreign embassies in Rustchuk|thumb]]

Ruse had the first Bulgarian factories for soda water, lemonade, and for neckties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.sudigital.org/record/470/files/Almanah%20PDF.pdf] "Mеждународен алманах за България 1898. Annuaire international de la Bulgarie. 1898 / А Дюрастел" – page 443&lt;/ref&gt; The first aviator Simeon Petrov was born in Ruse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.rodenkrai.com/new/bylgarska_aviaciq/pyrviqt_bylgarski_diplomiran_pilot.html] Симеон Петров – първият дипломиран пилот&lt;/ref&gt;

In the newly liberated Bulgaria of the late 19th century, Ruse was a cosmopolitan city with a multiethnic population. According to the first census conducted in 1883, ethnic Bulgarians made up 43% of the population, Turks 39%, and Jews 7%.

"All façades on main streets of Russe shall have rich decorations with plastic stone", postulate the Regulations for Constructions of Private Buildings of 1893, issued by the Municipality of Russe.

After [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|knyaz Alexander Battenberg's]] 1886 [[History of Independent Bulgaria#Ferdinand|abdication]], and as a reaction to the regentship's course led by prime minister [[Stefan Stambolov]], a group of Russophile (pro-Russian) military officers revolted in Ruse. The riot was violently crushed, and 13 of the leaders were quickly sentenced to death and executed near the city, which caused much public discontent. Decades later, in 1934, local citizens raised funds and built a monument at the place where the Russophile officers were executed. The monument was blown up in 1940 but rebuilt in 1966 at approximately the same spot.

=== Early 20th century ===
* 1908 – The first factory for iron beds in Modern Bulgaria. Today Ruse is a major centre of furniture manufacturing.
* 1911 was marked off with the start of a project for electrical station by "Siemens-Schukert". On 17 February 1917 Ruse became the third electrified city in the country (after Sofia and Varna).
* In 1913 Belgian entrepreneurs and engineers were granted a concession for a period of 25 years and built the largest sugar factory in Bulgaria.
[[File:Staroto-kazino.jpg|300px|thumb|The Municipal casino, Ruse – 1920]]
* 1927 – the first sock-making factory in Bulgaria opened in Ruse. "Fazan" still exists today;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fazansocks.com/_uk/company_en.htm] "Първата чорапена фабрика в България"&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1933 – the first oil refinery was constructed;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petrol.bg/history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719012310/http://www.petrol.bg/history.php |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between World War I and [[World War II|II]], after [[Southern Dobruja]] was lost to Romania, the economic significance of the city decreased. So did the population: Ruse was no longer the second-largest city in Bulgaria (after former [[East Rumelia]]n capital [[Plovdiv]]), being quickly surpassed by [[Sofia]] and [[Varna]]. Foreign consulates were closed, except for the Russian one, which has remained functional since. Only for the period between 1919 and 1920 the capital loss is estimated of around 40 million leva.

=== World War II period ===
The return of Southern Dobrudja to Bulgaria in September 1940 fostered good conditions for restoration of the city's leading role. It became a provincial centre, and economic activity revived. Typical for the post-war architecture of the city was the wide use of iron, concrete and glass as construction materials. Examples are the River port – 1931, the Freight station – 1935, Market Hall – 1939 and the Court house – 1940.

The construction of the [[Giurgiu-Rousse Friendship Bridge|Ruse-Giurgiu bridge]] in 1954 and the fast industrialization gave a new push to development. Ruse emerged again as an important economic, transport, cultural, and education hub. Engineering, chemical, and light industries expanded; a large harbor was built; and the city became a university centre. At the 1985 census, a population of more than 186,000 was reported.

In the early 1980s, Ruse entered a dark period. The Verachim factory was built in Giurgiu, which polluted the air between 1980 and 1991, impacting the city's development. Population decreased, and 15,000 people moved out between 1985 and 1992. The first informal organization in Bulgaria under the communist regime was established here - The Public Committee for Environmental Protection of Ruse, which provoked the first nationwide demonstrations and strongly influenced the [[History of the People's Republic of Bulgaria#Fall of the Communist regime|change to democracy]]. In 1991, the Romanian factory ceased the pollution, after the fall of the communist regime in Romania. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bnr.bg/en/post/100565149/1987-public-protests-against-gassing-of-ruse-kick-off|title=1987: Public protests against gassing of Ruse kick off|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other post-socialist regimes in eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the transition to capitalism rather painful and not easy as expected. State-owned enterprises lost their former markets and could not adapt to the now free-market competition. This led to massive unemployment in the city and emigration waves in 90s. Since 2000, Ruse has been continually regaining its former leading status. The urban economics were positively influenced by the [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|2007's accession of Bulgaria and Romania in the European Union]], which allowed deeper cross-border cooperation. The flow of investments through EU funds restarted long suspended projects which were finally completed.

After decades of construction the new corpus of the [[University of Ruse]] was inaugurated in 2010.

In 2011 city's centre was renovated through an EU project, worth 10 million leva. Included in the project, a Dry Deck Fountain was introduced in an urban environment for the first time in Bulgaria. The exterior of the [[Rousse State Opera]] was reconditioned.

A water treatment facility, an investment worth 57 million Euro, is now functional.

In 2012 the [[Rousse Regional Historical Museum]] completed a project, which allowed the rehabilitation and display of the remains of the Roman city Sexaginta Prista.

[[Ignat Kaneff]], a Bulgarian-born Canadian business magnate, endowed about half of the amount necessary for the construction of a modern conference complex named after him, the Kaneff Centre, at the [[University of Ruse]]. It was officially opened on 10 October 2013.

A landmark event for the city was the opening of the new Eco Museum &amp; Aquarium in 2014.

A safer and more efficient navigation in the inland waterways was accomplished with a new structure – the river information system BulRIS. A modern oncology centre is now operating.

Ruse was a candidate for a [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2019&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruse2019.eu/|title=Singel Dejting|website=ruse2019.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the concept "Free spirit city".

[[Dohodno zdanie]], an imposing Neoclassical edifice in the city centre convincingly won the National competition "Emblematic building of the year" in 2014. Ruse was a host city of the first of its kind in Bulgaria – an International Ice Figures Festival.

The [[Arena Ruse]] sports hall with more than 5100 seats opened on 23 July 2015 nearly 40 years after initial construction efforts began. The project was suspended on numerous occasions due to a lack of financing. An underground parking inside the sports hall has also been completed.

On-going projects are the re-cultivation of the old landfill, worth 22,5 million leva. The biggest roundabout in the city with underpasses for pedestrians and cyclists, worth some 10 million leva was reconstructed.

=== Infrastructure ===
[[File:Letishte-ruse.jpg|thumb| [[Ruse Airport]]]]

Ruse is a major road and railway hub in Northern Bulgaria. Railway transportation in the city dates back to 1867 when it became a station of first railway line in Bulgaria Ruse – Varna. There are railways to Southern Bulgaria, [[Sofia]], Varna and [[Bucharest]]. Ruse has two railway stations for passenger services ([[Ruse Central railway station|Ruse Central]] and Ruse Razpredelitelna) and two for freight transport services. There are intercity buses that link Ruse with cities and towns all over the country and some European countries. They are based in two bus stations: South and East.

Ruse has an extensive public transport system with around 30 [[bus]] and [[trolleybus]] lines, including the [[Trolleybuses in Ruse|Ruse trolleybus system]]. Most of the buses are operated under a concession by the Bulgarian subsidiary of the Israeli transport holding Egged Ruse. There are also several suburban bus lines, operated by various private Bulgarian transport companies. A 14 kilometer bicycle network is currently under development in the city.

Approximately {{convert|17|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast of Ruse is the village of [[Shtraklevo]], near which is the former military and passenger [[Ruse Airport]]. It is owned by the municipality of Ruse, with an active license for small passenger and cargo flights (license issued on 21.12.2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/biznes/2016/12/21/2887562_malki_samoleti_veche_shte_mogat_da_kacat_na_letishte/|title=Малки самолети вече ще могат да кацат на летище "Русе"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The runway is long enough for [[Boeing 747]]s (Jumbo Jets). The [[Henri Coandă International Airport]] in [[Otopeni]], Romania is {{convert|70|km|abbr=off}} north of Ruse.

The [[Danube Bridge|Danube bridge]] is located east of Ruse. It was the only road and rail bridge between Bulgaria and Romania until the opening of a second bridge crossing to Romania on 14 June 2013 at [[Vidin]].
{{wide image|Rousse-Giurgiu Bridge.jpg|1024px|[[Danube Bridge|The Friendship Bridge]], connecting Bulgaria with [[Romania]]}}
Ruse is the biggest Bulgarian port towns on the bank of the Danube River. After the opening of the [[Rhine–Main–Danube Canal]] which covers {{convert|3500|km|0|abbr=on}} and connects 13 European countries with Asia via the Black Sea, the river becomes the longest inland waterway on the planet. This key position has determined the 19th century-long co-existence of Ruschuk.

The '''Sri Yantra''' or '''Sri Chakra''' is a form of mystical diagram (''[[yantra]]'') used in the [[Shri Vidya]] school of [[Hindu tantra]]. It consists of nine interlocking triangles that surround a central point known as a [[bindu (symbol)|''bindu'']]. These triangles represent the cosmos and the human body. Because of its nine triangles, Sri Yantra is also known as the ''Navayoni Chakra''.&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Chakr|last=Shankaranarayanan|first=S.|publisher=Dipti Publications|year=1979|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[two-dimensional]] Sri Yantra is represented in [[three dimensions]], it is called a ''Maha Meru''. [[Mount Meru]] derives its name from this shape. In addition to Mount Meru, all other yantras derive from the Sri Yantra.

{{Hinduism}}
The Sri Yantra's 9 constituent triangles vary in size and shape and intersect to form 43 smaller triangles, organized in 5 concentric levels. Together they represent the totality of the cosmos and express [[Advaita]] or [[non-duality]]. In the middle, the power point (''bindu'') represents the cosmic center. The triangles are circumscribed by two concentric circles composed of 8 and 16 petals, representing the [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] of creation and reproductive vital force. The entire configuration is framed by the broken lines of an earth square, representing a temple with four doors open onto the regions of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eb.pdn.ipublishcentral.com/product/culture-india|title=Understanding India: The Culture of India|last=Kuiper|first=K|publisher=Britannica Educational Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781615302031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
The worship of the Sri Yantra is central to the Shri Vidya system of Hindu worship. It represents the goddess in the form of Shri Lalita or [[Tripura Sundari]], ''the beauty of the three worlds'': Bhu [[Loka]] (Physical Plane, Consciousness of the Physical Plane), Bhuvar Loka (Antariksha or Intermediate Space Consciousness of the Prana) and Swar Loka ([[Svarga]] or Heaven or Consciousness of the Divine Mind). The Sri Yantra is the symbol of [[Hindu tantra]], which is based on the [[Hindu philosophy]] of [[Shaktism]]. The Sri Yantra is the object of devotion in Sri Vidya.&lt;ref name="Gales"&gt;{{cite book |last=Khanna |first1=Madhu |title=Gale's Encyclopedia of Religion |chapter=Yantra |edition=Second |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Lindsay |publisher=Thomson Gale |year=2005 |pages=9871–9872 |isbn=0-02-865997-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sri Yantra represents the union of Masculine and Feminine Divine. The four upward-pointing [[isosceles triangle]]s represent the goddess's masculine embodiment [[Shiva]], while the five downward-pointing triangles symbolize the female embodiment [[Shakti]].&lt;ref name="Gales" /&gt;

The Sri Yantra is also known as the ''nav chakra'' because it can be seen to consist of nine concentric layers that radiate outward from the ''bindu''. ("Nau" or "nava" means "nine" in [[Sanskrit]].) Each level corresponds to a [[mudra]], a [[yogini]] and a specific form of the deity Tripura Sundari along with her [[mantra]]. The various deities residing in the nine levels of the Sri Yantra are described in the Devi [[Khadgamala]] Mantra. These levels, listed from outermost to innermost, are:&lt;ref name="SC" /&gt;
#''Trailokya Mohana'', the outermost square, traced in three lines and interrupted by four recessed portals;
#''Sarvasaa Paripuraka'', the outer lotus, consisting of 16 petals;
#''Sarva Samkshobahana'', the inner lotus, consisting of 8 petals;
#''Sarva Saubhagyadayaka'', the outermost ring of small triangles (14 in total);
#''Sarvarthasadhaka'', the next ring of triangles (10 in total);
#''Sarva Rakshakara'', a smaller ring of 10 triangles;
#''Sarva Rogahara'', a ring of 8 small triangles;
#''Sarva Siddhiprada'', one small triangle containing the ''bindu'' at its center;
#''Sarva Anandamaya'', the ''bindu.''

{{Tenrikyo sidebar}}
'''Tenrikyo Church Headquarters'''  (''Tenrikyo Kyokai Honbu'' 天理教教会本部) is the main [[headquarters]] of the [[Tenrikyo]] [[religion]], located in [[Tenri, Nara|Tenri]], [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]], Japan. This establishment is significant to followers because it is built around the ''[[Jiba (Tenrikyo)|Jiba]]'', the spot where followers believe the god [[Tenri-O-no-Mikoto]] conceived humankind.

==Organization==
===Hierarchy===
[[File:Second Shinbashira sermon.png|thumb|right|170px|[[Nakayama Shozen]], the second ''[[Shinbashira]]''.]]

The organization of Tenrikyo Church Headquarters consists primarily of the headquarters proper (本部 ''honbu''), grand churches (大教会 ''daikyōkai''), branch churches (分教会 ''bunkyōkai''), and dioceses (教区 ''kyōku''). Under the management of the main headquarters is a dual organizational structure, such that the grand churches and branch churches minister to adherents genealogically while the dioceses minister to adherents geographically.{{sfn|Ellwood|1982|p=94}}

At the top of the church hierarchy is the ''[[Shinbashira]],'' who is defined as the "spiritual and administrative leader" of Tenrikyo Church Headquarters.

Many of the current grand churches were established by missionaries around the turn of the twentieth century, and typically the head ministers of the grand churches are hereditary or adoptive successors of those first missionaries. The head ministers of the grand churches are closely affiliated with the headquarters and supervise the daughter and granddaughter churches under their pastoral care, called branch churches. Therefore, the majority of branch churches belong to a grand church, and the two form the ecclesiastical equivalent of a parent-child relationship. However, a small group of branch churches happen to be directly affiliated with the headquarters for historical or administrative reasons.{{sfn|Ellwood|1982|p=94–5}}

The diocese is responsible for supervising the Tenrikyo churches in a given [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]]. The diocese administrator approves church maintenance, fiscal budgets, and the hiring and dismissal of church staff.{{sfn|Ellwood|1982|p=95}}

==Sanctuaries==
===Main Sanctuary===
[[File:Tenrikyo Church Headquarters North Worship Hall.jpg|thumb|North section (Worship Hall) of the Main Sanctuary.]]

The Main Sanctuary (神殿 ''Shinden'') houses the ''[[Kanrodai]],'' the stand that marks the ''[[Jiba (Tenrikyo)|Jiba]]'' where adherents believe God conceived humankind.

The earliest sanctuary was the ''Tsutome basho'' (Place for the Service), constructed by the [[carpenter]] [[Iburi Izo]] in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;『改訂天理教辞典』 Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten, p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Taishō period, a major construction project was undertaken, and as a result what is currently the north section of the Main Sanctuary was completed in December 1913.&lt;ref&gt;『改訂天理教辞典』 ''Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten,'' pp. 506–507.&lt;/ref&gt; Another construction project took place during the Shōwa period, which led to the completion of the south section in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;『改訂天理教辞典』 Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten, pp. 434–435.&lt;/ref&gt; The west and east sections were expanded from 1977 to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;『改訂天理教辞典』 Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten, p. 667.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundress' Sanctuary===
[[File:Oyasama's Residence.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The Foundress' Sanctuary.]]

The Foundress' Sanctuary (教祖殿 ''Kyōsoden'') is a building dedicated to the foundress of Tenrikyo, [[Nakayama Miki]]. 

The first sanctuary was a temporary structure constructed in 1895. As part of a major construction effort during the [[Taishō period]], the Foundress’ Sanctuary was completed in April 1914. This building is currently used as the Memorial Hall (see below). In the [[Shōwa period]], another major construction took place, and as a result a larger Foundress' Hall was completed and dedicated on October 25, 1933.&lt;ref name=kyosoden&gt;Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion (1997). Kyōsoden [Foundress' Sanctuary]. In ''Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten.'' (p. 277). Tenri, Japan: Tenrikyō Dōyūsha.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorial Hall===
[[File:Tenrikyo-Headquarter soreiden.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The entrance to the Memorial Hall.]]
The Memorial Hall (祖霊殿 ''Soreiden'') is a [[memorial]] that honors deceased Tenrikyo adherents, located northwest of the Main Sanctuary and connected by a sanctuary corridor.&lt;ref name=soreiden&gt;Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion (1997). Soreiden [Memorial Hall]. In ''Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten.'' (p. 500). Tenri, Japan: Tenrikyō Dōyūsha.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest memorial dedicated to Tenrikyo followers was inside the ''Tsutome basho'' (Place for the Service), an early worship hall. As part of a major construction effort during the Taisho era, a memorial was built in the middle of the corridor connecting the Main Sanctuary and the Foundress' Sanctuary. The current Memorial Hall structure was also built during this time, though it was conceived originally as the Foundress' Sanctuary. In 1914, memorial services (''mitamasai'') began to be conducted in the spring and fall of each year. In 1933, the current structure for the Foundress’ Sanctuary was constructed, and the previous structure was renamed the Memorial Hall.&lt;ref name=soreiden /&gt;

[[File:Tenrikyo Memorial Hall inside.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Altars inside the Memorial Hall.]]
Inside the Memorial Hall, there are three altars. The middle altar honors deceased members of the Nakayama family, including the late [[Shinbashira|Shinbashiras]] and their wives, as well as the early disciples [[Izo Iburi]], Naraito Ueda, and Chushichi Yamanaka. The right altar honors deceased performers of the [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]] conducted at Tenrikyo Church Headquarters. The left altar honors deceased church ministers and followers.&lt;ref name=soreiden /&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of Tenrikyo}}
===Obtaining government recognition===
Due to constant persecution from local government authorities and from members of established religions, the followers of Tenrikyo wanted to apply for legal authorization to establish a church. However, [[Meiji Constitution|Japanese law during the Meiji period]] stipulated that legal authorization could only be granted if the church were classified under an established tradition, such as [[Shinto]], [[Buddhism]], or [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Tenrikyo does not consider itself a Shinto tradition,&lt;ref&gt;See Yoshinori Moroi's "Critique on H. van Straelen's "The Religion of Divine Wisdom"" from ''Tenrikyo: Its History and Teachings,'' p.260-262.&lt;/ref&gt; early followers agreed to file under Shinto in order to obtain the protections from legal authorization. Several failed attempts were made; the first one was in April 29, 1885 to the governor of Osaka Prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo'', p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Shinto Main Bureau===
Tenrikyo Church Headquarters was established in [[1888]] as a religious organization belonging to the [[Shinto Taikyo|Shinto Main Bureau]] (神道本局 ''Shinto Honkyoku''). The legal authorization removed the threat of suppression and allowed followers could seek permission to establish branch churches and to gain official recognition for [[missionary]] work. The membership rose sharply in the first decade of the Headquarters' existence. In 1892, the number of Tenrikyo followers had allegedly reached over one million, a thirty-fold increase in membership in five years. By December 1896, Tenrikyo had 3,137,113 members belonging to 1,078 churches, and there were 19,061 ministers. This growth invited negative reactions from Buddhist institutions, which were concerned about losing adherents, and from newspapers, who labeled the religion as "anti-social."&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 1896, the [[Home Ministry]] (内務省 ''Naimu-shō'') issued "Directive No. 12," which ordered strict and secretive surveillance over Tenrikyo Church Headquarters under the pretense of maintaining and strengthening the [[kokutai|state polity]] of Japan. Issues raised by authorities were the congregation of both men and women together, the obstruction of medical treatment and the alleged policy of enforced donations."&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tenrikyo leaders complied to the state's demands in several ways. They changed several aspects of their prayer ritual, known to adherents as the "Service".&lt;ref&gt;As for the exact changes made in the prayer ritual: "Only the second and third sections of the Service were allowed to be performed; only male performers could perform the Service; only men's instruments could be played; and the ''[[kagura]]'' masks were to be placed in front of the Service performers instead of being worn by them" (''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 61). For more information on the "Service," see ''[[Mikagura-uta]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the Tenrikyo deity [[Tenri-O-no-Mikoto]] was changed to Tenri-no-Okami. Tenrikyo's doctrine was altered to conform with the official [[State Shinto]] doctrine. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters' conformity with the state demands resulted in a dual structure of the Tenrikyo faith, where on the surface, Tenrikyo complied with the state demands, while adherents disregarded those changes and maintained the teachings and rites as initially taught by [[Miki Nakayama]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 61-63.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drive toward sectarian independence===
In 1899 the Shinto Main Bureau advised the Tenrikyo Church Headquarters officials about the possibility of official recognition as an independent religion (independent meaning to be classified directly under the [[Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji government]], which upheld State Shinto ideology). Tenrikyo leaders worked to systemize the Tenrikyo doctrine and institutionalize the organization so that the petition for independence would pass. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters made a total of five attempts before it finally achieved independence in 1908.

On April 1, 1900, Tenri Seminary, Tenrikyo’s first educational institution, was founded as a training school for ministers. In 1902, Tenrikyo arranged its mission administration system in Japan, which divided the country into ten dioceses and appointed superintendents to supervise regional missionary activities.

In 1903,&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; a edition of Tenrikyo's doctrine was compiled (known today as the ''Meiji kyoten'', or the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] version of Tenrikyo's doctrine). This edition of the doctrine differs significantly from the present edition&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the ''Meiji kyoten'' contained ten chapters: 'Revering God,' 'Respecting the Emperor,' 'Loving the Nation,' 'Morality,' 'Accumulating Virtues,' 'Cleansing of Impurities,' 'Founding of the Teachings,' 'Repayment to God,' 'the Kagura', and 'Peace of Mind.' See ''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness,'' p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; because the teachings of State Shinto were incorporated in order to gain the Home Ministry's approval. Although Tenrikyo Church Headquarters complied with many of the state's requests, it did not compromise on the request to completely eliminate the ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'' ("The Songs for the Service"), one of Tenrikyo's main scriptures.

Around this time, Tenrikyo began to open its first churches overseas in [[Taiwan]] (1897), [[Korea]] (1904), [[Manchuria]] (1911), the [[United States|U.S.]] (1927), [[Brazil]], and [[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian]] countries.

===Sect Shinto===
The fifth petition for independence was submitted to the Home Ministry on March 20, 1908 and accepted later that year in November 27. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters set up its Administrative Headquarters, formally appointed Shinnosuke Nakayama as the first ''shinbashira'', the spiritual and administrative leader of Tenrikyo, and established its constitution. On February 25, 1912, the Home Ministry invited representatives from seventy-three religious groups to the [[:ja:三教会同|Three Religions Conference]] (三教会同 ''Sankyokaido'') including a Tenrikyo representative (the three religions represented were Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity, and Tenrikyo was categorized under Shinto). This conference initiated a program of national edification, and with the support of the government, Tenrikyo was able to hold lectures at 2,074 places through Japan, drawing nearly a quarter million listeners.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 64-7&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the relative relaxation of state control on Tenrikyo rituals, the performance of [[Mikagura-uta#Section One|section one of the Mikagura-uta]] was restored in 1916, after two decades of prohibition under the Home Ministry’s directive.  

In 1925, a school of foreign languages was established for missionaries, including what would become [[Tenri Central Library]]. The same year saw the establishment of a printing office, a department for researching of doctrinal and biographical materials, and a major expansion of the church's education system, including a new girls’ school, nursery, kindergarten, and elementary school. 

In 1928, the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'' was published. Three years later, in 1931, the publication of the ''[[Osashizu]]'' was completed, making the three main scriptures of Tenrikyo available to all followers for the first time. 

On the occasion of the completion of the South Worship Hall of the Main Sanctuary in 1934, the [[Service (Tenrikyo)#Kagura Service|Kagura Service]] was restored for the first time since it had been prohibited in 1896.

===Wartime Japan===
As the war between Japan and China grew from the [[Mukden Incident]] to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], state control of religious and secular thought intensified. For example, in December 1935, state authorities destroyed the buildings of [[Ōmoto|Omotokyo]] Headquarters and arrested the organization's leaders. One week later, on December 16, 1935, around four hundred policemen were sent to investigate Tenrikyo Church Headquarters on suspicion of tax evasion, even though there were no grounds for that accusation.

After the [[National Mobilization Law]] was passed in 1938, Japan’s wartime polity strengthened. In 1939, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters announced that it would reform its doctrine and ritual, under threat of forced disbanding of the organization by state authorities. Under the reformation, copies of the ''Ofudesaki'' and ''Osashizu'' were recalled, certain chapters were deleted from the ''Mikagura-uta'',&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, Yorozuyo, Song Three, and Song Five. See ''[[Mikagura-uta]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Kagura Service, an important Tenrikyo ritual, was not allowed to be performed. All preaching, rites, and events were to follow the Meiji version of Tenrikyo's doctrine from 1903. The 1940 [[Religious Organizations Law]] further increased state surveillance and oppression in Japan.

===After World War II===
In its own historical account, Tenrikyo refers to the years following the [[Surrender of Japan|surrender of Japan]] and the conclusion of [[World War II]] as ''fukugen'', or "restoration."&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 77.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the significant aspects of the "restoration" was the republishing and reissuing of the three scriptures of Tenrikyo in their entirety: the ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'' in 1946, the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'' in 1948, and the ''[[Osashizu]]'' in 1949. In addition, the doctrine, which for decades had been colored by State Shinto ideology, was revised to reflect the teachings conveyed in the main scriptures and authorized in 1949.

Another aspect of the "restoration" was the construction of the [[Oyasato-yakata]], begun in 1954. As of 1998, twenty four wings have been completed and are used for various purposes, such as educational facilities, medicinal facilities, institutes for doctrinal studies and religious training, and followers' dormitories. The construction continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue," a symposium cosponsored by [[Tenri University]] and [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], was held in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] from March 9–11, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;The Organizing Committee of Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue. ''Tenrikyo Christian Dialogue.'' Tenri University Press, 1999, Tenri, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the universities cosponsored another symposium, "Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue II," held at [[Tenri, Nara|Tenri, Japan]] from September 28–30, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;The Organizing Committee of Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue II. ''Tenrikyo Christian Dialogue.'' Tenri University Press, 2005, Tenri, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Blue Equinox''''', officially known as '''''The Equinox: Volume III, Number I''''', is a book written by the English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], the founder of [[Thelema]]. First published in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lon Milo Duquette]], ''The Magick of Aleister Crowley: A Handbook of the Rituals of Thelema'', page 258 (Red Wheel/Weiser; 1993). {{ISBN|1-57863-299-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; it details the principles and aims of the secret society [[Ordo Templi Orientis|O.T.O.]] and its ally the [[A∴A∴]], both of which were under Crowley's control at the time. It includes such topics as ''The Law of Liberty'', [[The Gnostic Mass]], and Crowley's ''Hymn to Pan''.

==Background==
In 1904, Crowley was staying in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] with his wife Rose when he claimed to undergo a spiritual experience.

==Synopsis==
''The Blue Equinox'' opens with Crowley's poem "Hymn to Pan", a devotional work devoted to the ancient Greek deity [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cro07|Crowley 2007 [1929]]]. pp. 5&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by an editorial, in which Crowley discusses Thelema, the A∴A∴ and the O.T.O., and the important role which he believed that they had to play in the Aeon of Horus.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cro07|Crowley 2007 [1929]]]. pp. 9&amp;ndash;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theistic Satanism''' or '''spiritual Satanism''' is an umbrella term for religious beliefs that consider [[Satan]] as an objectively existing supernatural being or force worthy of supplication, with whom individuals may contact, convene and even praise, rather than him being just an [[archetype]], symbol or idea as in [[LaVeyan Satanism]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite book | last=Partridge | first=Christopher Hugh | year=2004 | title=The Re-enchantment of the West |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g05THJPH5xUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Re-enchantment+of+the+West&amp;lr=&amp;sig=BmuWhU0n3TzA3fd4NfIBDPuCFjo#PPP1,M1 | accessdate=12 May 2008 |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theisticsatanism.com/rituals/prayers.html|title=Prayers to Satan|work=theisticsatanism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual belief systems under this umbrella are practiced by loosely affiliated or independent groups and cabals. Another characteristic of Theistic Satanism is the use of [[ceremonial magic]].&lt;ref name="mlo_interview" /&gt;

The history of theistic Satanism, as an existing spiritual path practiced by people, is obscured by a number of groups accused of being devil-worshippers who asserted that they were not, such as in the [[witch trials in Early Modern Europe]]. Most actual theistic Satanist religions exist in relatively new models and ideologies, many of which claim to be independent of the [[Abrahamic religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voiceofsatanism.com/2010/09/21/origins-of-satanism-why-sumeria/ |title=The Origins of Satan, Why Sumeria? |accessdate=2011-11-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424002704/http://voiceofsatanism.com/2010/09/21/origins-of-satanism-why-sumeria/ |archivedate=24 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Currents within recent and contemporary theistic Satanism==
The internet has increased awareness of different beliefs among Satanists, and has led to more diverse groups, but [[Satanism]] has always been a pluralistic and decentralised religion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis | first=James R. |author2=Jesper Aagaard Petersen  |   title=Controversial New Religions | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2004

page=429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars outside Satanism have sought to study it by categorizing forms of it according to whether they are theistic or atheistic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallagher |first=Eugene V. |title=The New Religious Movements Experience in America |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=0-313-32807-2 |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to the practice of working with a literal Satan as theistic or "traditional" Satanism.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; It is generally a prerequisite to being considered a theistic Satanist that the Satanist accept a theological and metaphysical canon involving one or more god(s) who are either Satan in the strictest, Abrahamic sense, or a concept of Satan that incorporates gods from other religions (usually pre-Christian), such as [[Ahriman]] or [[Enki]]. A small, now-defunct Satanist group called Children of the Black Rose equated Satan with the [[pantheistic]] the All.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis | first=James R. |author2=Jesper Aagaard Petersen  |   title=Controversial New Religions | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2004
|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e0TfqG3XNmEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Controversial+New+Religions&amp;sig=ZOIBD3jI0X478aRBL_6TSmba3lE  |accessdate=24 May 2008 |
page=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many theistic Satanists believe their own individualized concept based on pieces of all these diverse conceptions of Satan, according to their inclination and spiritual guidance, rather than only believe in one suggested interpretation. Some may choose to live out the myths and stereotypes, but Christianity is not always the primary frame of reference for theistic Satanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis | first=James R. |author2=Jesper Aagaard Petersen | title=Controversial New Religions | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2004 | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e0TfqG3XNmEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Controversial+New+Religions&amp;sig=ZOIBD3jI0X478aRBL_6TSmba3lE  | accessdate=24 May 2008 | page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their religion may be based on [[neopaganism|dark pagan]], [[left hand path]], [[black magic]], and [[occult]] traditions. Theistic Satanists who base their faith on Christian ideas about Satan may be referred to as “reverse Christians” by other Satanists, often in a pejorative fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/mjr/lewis2.html|title=Marburg Journal of Religion (June 2001) Lewis, James R.|work=uni-marburg.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those labeled by some as “reverse Christians” may see their concept of Satan as undiluted or sanitized. They worship a stricter interpretation of Satan: that of the Satan featured in the Christian Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060622092759/http://www.angelfire.com/rebellion2/traditionalsatanism/view.html Archived Cathedral of the Black Goat 'Views' Page]&lt;/ref&gt; This is not, however, shared by a majority of theistic Satanists. [[Wicca]]ns may consider most Satanism to be reverse Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzger | first=Richard |author2=Grant Morrison  | title=Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult | publisher=The Disinformation Company | year=2003 | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W6IycFk3VZ0C&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=%22reverse+christianity%22&amp;sig=-oWUmZOWWbUL6FXp5eCS2KNxqUU#PPA266,M1 | accessdate=5 June 2008 | page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the head of the atheistic [[Church of Satan]], [[Peter H. Gilmore]], considers “devil worship” to be a Christian heresy, that is, a divergent form of Christianity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/Feared.html|title=Satanism: The Feared Religion|author=High Priest, Magus Peter H. Gilmore|work=churchofsatan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of individual beliefs within theistic Satanism, while being a cause for intense debates within the religion, is also often seen as a reflection of Satan, who encourages individualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Susej | first=Tsirk | year=2007 | title=The Demonic Bible |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BSW_4ohAM8QC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22traditional+satanism%22+date:1500-2008&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=JnTS_53SxlWvpk7fH-RQnG0Nk7Q#PPA12,M1  | accessdate=12 May 2008 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Luciferianism, Michael W. Ford, author and founder of The Order of Phosphorus, Black Order of the Dragon and later co-founder of the Assembly of Light Bearers, presents both a Theistic and Atheistic approach to Luciferianism, all centered in the foundation of the 11 Luciferian Points of Power&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bible of the Adversary Anniversary Edition|last=Ford|first=Michael|publisher=Succubus Productions Publishing|year=2017|isbn=9781979202596|location=Houston, Texas|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the core of the philosophy. Theistic Luciferianism is considered a individualistic, personal spirituality which is established via initiation and validation of the Adversarial philosophy. Luciferians, if Theistic, do not accept the submission of 'worship' yet rather a unique and subjective type of Apotheosis via the energies of perceived deities, spirits and demons. 

A notable group that outwardly considers themselves to be traditional Satanists is the [[Order of Nine Angles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/satanism/intro.html#atheistic/theistic|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829152745/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/satanism/intro.html#atheistic/theistic|title=The Religious Movements Homepage|archivedate=29 August 2006|work=virginia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group became controversial and was mentioned in the press and in books, because they promoted human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis | first=James R. | title=Satanism Today: An Encyclopedia of Religion | publisher=ABC-CLIO | year=2001 | isbn=1-57607-759-4 | page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The O9A believes that Satan is one of two 'acausal' eternal beings, the other one being [[Baphomet]], and that Satan is male and Baphomet is female.

A group with very different ideology to the ONA is the Satanic Reds, whose Satanism has a communist element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis | first=James R. | title=Satanism Today: An Encyclopedia of Religion | publisher=ABC-CLIO | year=2001 | isbn=1-57607-759-4 | page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are not theistic Satanist in the manner of believing in Satan as a god with a personality, but believe in dark [[deism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theisticsatanism.com/geifodd/varieties.html|title=DEVIL WORSHIP|work=theisticsatanism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the belief that Satan is a presence in nature. The First Church of Satan believe the philosophy propounded by [[Anton LaVey]] himself was deism or [[panentheism]] but is propounded as atheism by the leaders of the Church of Satan in order to distance themselves from what they see as pseudo-Satanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofsatan.org/|title=SATANISM CENTRAL: Answers to All Your Questions|work=churchofsatan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One other group is the [[Temple of the Black Light]], formerly known as the Misanthropic Luciferian Order prior to 2007. The group espouses a philosophy known as “Chaosophy”. Chaosophy asserts that the world that we live in, and the universe that it lives in, all exists within the realm known as Cosmos. Cosmos is made of three spatial dimensions and one linear time dimension. Cosmos rarely ever changes and is a materialistic realm. Another realm that exists is known as Chaos. Chaos exists outside of the Cosmos and is made of infinite dimensions and unlike the Cosmos, it is always changing. Members of the TotBL believe that the realm of Chaos is ruled over by 11 dark gods, the highest of them being Satan, and all of said gods are considered manifestations of a higher being. This higher being is known as Azerate, the Dragon Mother, and is all of the 11 gods united as one. The TotBL believes that Azerate will resurrect one day and destroy the Cosmos and let Chaos consume everything. The group has been connected to the Swedish [[Black metal|black]]/[[death metal]] band [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], particularly its front man [[Jon Nödtveidt]].&lt;ref name="mlo_interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/extreme/slayermagazine/interview_mlo2.html |title=Interview_MLO |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nödtveidt was introduced to the group “at an early stage”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalcentre.com/webzine.php?p=interviews&amp;lang=eng&amp;nr=123 |title=Dissection.

Theistic [[Luciferianism|Luciferian]] groups, such as the former Children of the Black Rose, are particularly inspired by [[Lucifer]] (from the Latin for ‘bearer of light’), who they may or may not equate with Satan. While some theologians believe the Son of the Dawn, Lucifer, and other names were actually used to refer to contemporary political figures, such as a Babylonian King, rather than a single spiritual entity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realdevil.info/5-5.htm|title=Lucifer King Of Babylon|work=realdevil.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestedscriptures.com/b07satan/isaiah14v12-14.html Satan, Devil and Demons - Isaiah 14:12-14&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (although on the surface the Bible explicitly refers to the King of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrus]]), those that believe it refers to Satan infer that by implication it also applies to the fall of Satan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04764a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Devil|work=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers equate the veneration of Set by the [[Temple of Set]] to theistic Satanism.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; However, the Temple of Set do not identify as theistic Satanists. They believe the Egyptian deity Set is the real Dark Lord behind the name Satan, of whom Satan is just a caricature. Their practices primarily center on self-development. Within the temple of Set, the Black Flame is the individual's god-like core which is a kindred spirit to Set, and they seek to develop. In theistic Satanism, the Black Flame is knowledge which was given to humanity by Satan, who is a being independent of the Satanist himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ford | first=Michael | year=2005 | title=Luciferian Witchcraft |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jv_gilqk-pwC&amp;pg=PA373&amp;dq=%22black+flame%22+satan&amp;lr=&amp;sig=xX8XJPGG_-8fjt2pD4zVmCPEJao#PPA373,M1 | accessdate=5 June 2008 |page=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which he can dispense to the Satanist who seeks knowledge.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite book | last=Partridge | first=Christopher Hugh | year=2004 | title=The Re-enchantment of the West |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g05THJPH5xUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Re-enchantment+of+the+West&amp;lr=&amp;sig=BmuWhU0n3TzA3fd4NfIBDPuCFjo#PPP1,M1 | accessdate=5 June 2008 |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups are mistaken by scholars for Theistic Satanists, such as the First Church of Satan.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;  However, the founder of the FCoS considers what he calls "devil-worship" to often be a symptom of psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alleeshadowtradition.com/psychosis.html Is Devil Worship a Symptom of Psychosis? by High Priest John Allee&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups such as the 600 Club,&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; are accepting of all types of Satanist, as are the Sinagogue of Satan, which aims for the ultimate destruction of religions, paradoxically including itself, and encourages not self-indulgence, but self-expression balanced by social responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Brown | first=Seth | year=2004 | title=Think You're the Only One? Oddball Groups Where Outsiders Fit In | pages=99–100 | publisher=Barnes and Noble | isbn=0760757089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=John | first=Mitchell | year=2009 |  title=Local writer compiles directory of unusual organizations | url=http://www.lastvisibledog.org/berkshirearts/Seth_Brown.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last=Mathews | first=Chris | year=2009 | title=Modern Satanism: anatomy of a radical subculture | page=92 |publisher=Praeger Publishers | isbn=978-0-313-36639-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of beliefs amongst Satanists, and the theistic nature of some Satanists, was seen in a survey in 1995. Some spoke of seeing Satan not as someone dangerous to those who seek or worship him, but as someone that could be approached as a friend. Some refer to him as ''Father'', though some other theistic Satanists consider that to be confused or excessively subservient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Pike | first=Randall | year=2007 | title=The Man with Confused Eyes | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Gc_5ulVoKe0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Man+with+Confused+Eyes&amp;lr=&amp;sig=QQEyatC_41l-s_eSGcga8y7JSiE | accessdate=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the Bible Satan is called the father of his followers in {{bibleref|John|8:44}}, and bad people are called "children of the devil" in {{bibleref|1 John|3:10}}. Satan is also portrayed as a father to his daughter, Sin, by [[John Milton|Milton]] in ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.

===Values in theistic Satanism===
[[File:Pentagram4.svg|thumb|The most notable symbol of theistic Satanism.]]
Seeking knowledge is seen by some theistic Satanists as being important to Satan, due to Satan being equated with the serpent in Genesis, which encouraged mankind to partake of the fruit of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book | last=Partridge | first=Christopher Hugh | year=2004 | title=The Re-enchantment of the West |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g05THJPH5xUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Re-enchantment+of+the+West&amp;lr=&amp;sig=BmuWhU0n3TzA3fd4NfIBDPuCFjo#PPP1,M1 | accessdate=12 May 2008 |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some perceive Satan as [[Eliphas Levi]]'s conception of [[Baphomet]] — a hermaphroditic bestower of knowledge ([[gnosis]]). Some Satanic groups, such as Luciferians, also seek to gain greater gnosis.&lt;ref name="mlo_interview"/&gt; Some of such Satanists, such as the former Ophite Cultus Satanas, equate [[Yahweh]] with the [[demiurge]] of [[Gnosticism]], and [[Satan]] with the transcendent being beyond.&lt;ref name="mlo_interview"/&gt;

Self-development is important to theistic Satanists. This is due to the Satanists' idea of Satan, who is seen to encourage individuality and freedom of thought, and the quest to raise one's self up despite resistance, through means such as [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and initiative. They believe Satan wants a more equal relationship with his followers than the Abrahamic God does with his. From a theistic Satanist perspective, the Abrahamic religions (chiefly Christianity) do not define “good” or “evil” in terms of benefit or harm to humanity, but rather on the submission to or rebellion against God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theisticsatanism.com/Muse/evilRose.html|title=Elliot Rose on "Evil"|work=theisticsatanism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Satanists seek to remove any means by which they are controlled or repressed by others and forced to follow the herd, and reject non-governmental authoritarianism.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis | first=James R. |author2=Jesper Aagaard Petersen | title=Controversial New Religions |

As Satan in the Old Testament tests people, theistic Satanists may believe that Satan sends them tests in life in order to develop them as individuals. They value taking responsibility for oneself. Despite the emphasis on self-development, some theistic Satanists believe that there is a will of Satan for the world and for their own lives. They may promise to help bring about the will of Satan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mickaharic | first=Draja | title=Practice of Magic: An Introductory Guide to the Art | publisher=Weiser | year=1995

They would also have to do what they could in everyday life to achieve their goals, however.

Theistic Satanists may try not to project an image that reflects negatively on their religion as a whole and reinforces stereotypes, such as promoting Nazism, abuse, or crime.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; However, some groups, such as the [[Order of Nine Angles]], criticize the emphasis on promoting a good image for Satanism; the ONA described LaVeyan Satanism as "weak, deluded and American form of 'sham-Satanic groups, the poseurs'",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nineangles.info/commentary-dreamers.pdf ''Commentary on Dreamers of the Dark''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124051552/http://www.nineangles.info/commentary-dreamers.pdf |date=24 January 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ONA member Stephen Brown claimed that "the Temple of Set seems intent only on creating a 'good public impression', with promoting an 'image'".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Brown: ''The Satanic Letters of Stephen Brown: St. Brown to Dr. Aquino'' ([http://www.angelfire.com/rings/blacklotusmonastery/texts/ONA_VariousManuscripts.pdf online version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113065041/http://www.angelfire.com/rings/blacklotusmonastery/texts/ONA_VariousManuscripts.pdf |date=13 January 2012 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; The order emphasises that its way "is and is meant to be dangerous"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nineangles.info/true_way_ona.html ''The True Way of the ONA''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702213716/http://www.nineangles.info/true_way_ona.html |date=2 July 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[g]enuine Satanists are dangerous people to know; associating with them is a risk".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nineangles.info/ona-epitome.html ''Satanism: The Epitome of Evil''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702213756/http://www.nineangles.info/ona-epitome.html |date=2 July 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the Temple of the Black Light has criticized the [[Church of Satan]], and has stated that the [[Temple of Set]] is "trying to make Setianism and the ruler of darkness, Set, into something accepted and harmless, this way attempting to become a 'big' religion, accepted and acknowledged by the rest of the [[Judeo-Christian|Judaeo-Christian]] society".&lt;ref name="mlo_interview"/&gt; The TotBL rejects [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] as "the opposite of everything that strengthens the spirit and is only good for killing what little that is beautiful, noble and honorable in this filthy world".&lt;ref name="mlo_interview"/&gt;

There is argument among Satanists over animal sacrifice, with most groups seeing it as both unnecessary and putting Satanism in a bad light, and distancing themselves from the few groups that practice it{{which|date=July 2015}}, such as the Temple of the Black Light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theisticsatanism.com/politics/animal-sacr.html|title=Animal Sacrifice and the Law|work=theisticsatanism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theistic Satanism often involves a religious commitment, rather than being simply an [[occult]] practice based on dabbling or transient enjoyment of the rituals and magic involved.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Partridge | first=Christopher Hugh | year=2004 | title=The Re-enchantment of the West |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g05THJPH5xUC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=%22traditional+satanism%22+date:1500-2008&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=YlACk-aeMwxBaflwts3p75efm5E | accessdate=12 May 2008 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners may choose to perform a self-dedication rite, although there are arguments over whether it is best to do this at the beginning of their time as a theistic Satanist, or once they have been practicing for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theisticsatanism.com/rituals/pact/pact-init.html#oath|title=Pacts and self-initiation|work=theisticsatanism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical mentions of Satanism==

[[File:Martin van Maele - La Sorcière 06.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Martin van Maële]], of a ''[[Witches' Sabbath]]'', in the 1911 edition of ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft|La Sorciere]]'', by [[Jules Michelet]].]]

The worship of Satan was a frequent charge against those charged in the witch trials in Early Modern Europe and other [[witch-hunt]]s such as the [[Salem witch trials]]. Worship of Satan was claimed to take place at the [[Witches' Sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D6-w4mlWup4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=servants+of+satan#PPA2,M1|title=Servants of Satan|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charge of Satan worship has also been made against groups or individuals regarded with suspicion, such as the [[Knights Templar]], or minority religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D6-w4mlWup4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=servants+of+satan|title=Servants of Satan|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Knights Templar, the Templars' writings mentioned the word 'Baphomet', which was a French corruption of the name '[[Mohammed]]' (the prophet of the people who the Templars fought against), and that 'Baphomet' was falsely portrayed as a demon by the people who accused the Templars.

It is not known to what extent accusations of groups worshiping Satan in the time of the witch trials identified people who did consider themselves Satanists, rather than being the result of religious superstition or mass hysteria, or charges made against individuals suffering from [[mental illness]]. Confessions are unreliable, particularly as they were usually obtained under [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D6-w4mlWup4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=servants+of+satan#PPA11,M1|title=Servants of Satan|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholar [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]], Professor Emeritus of the University of California at Santa Barbara, has made extensive arguments in his book ''Witchcraft in the Middle Ages''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LsjagvvkveEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=witchcraft+in+the+jeffrey+burton+russell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aucjBY8pRY&amp;sig=6M0qG_s1_M3eZRnPA4jwCEhvEak&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NBqNTMq-EY2csQPxxLydBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Witchcraft in the Middle Ages - Jeffrey Burton Russell - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that not all witch trial records can be dismissed and that there is in fact evidence linking [[witchcraft]] to [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] heresies. Russell comes to this conclusion after having studied the source documents themselves. Individuals involved in the [[Affair of the Poisons]] were accused of Satanism and witchcraft.

[[Image:Grimoirium verum full sigil of lucifer.png|thumb|The full [[Sigil (magic)|sigil]] of [[Lucifer]], as it originally appeared in the ''[[Grimorium Verum]]'']]
In the 18th century various kinds of popular “Satanic” literature began to be produced in France, including some well-known [[grimoire]]s with instructions for making a [[Deal with the Devil|pact with the Devil]]. Most notable are the ''[[Grimorium Verum]]'' and ''[[The Grand Grimoire]]''. The [[Marquis de Sade]] describes defiling crucifixes and other holy objects, and in his novel ''[[Justine (Sade)|Justine]]'' he gives a fictional account of the [[Black Mass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sade | first=Donatien | title=The Complete Marquis De Sade | pages=157–158 |publisher=Holloway House | year=2006 | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fOReeGwdFU8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Complete+Marquis+De+Sade&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=5ohshbIHd1Au0Bmw-oT0YsAqLVw |accessdate=22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Ronald Hayman]] has said Sade's need for blasphemy was an emotional reaction and rebellion from which Sade
moved on, seeking to develop a more reasoned atheistic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Eliphas Levi]] published his French books of the occult, and in 1855 produced his well-known drawing of the [[Baphomet]] which continues to be used by some Satanists today. That Baphomet drawing is the basis of the [[sigil of Baphomet]], which was first adopted by the non-theistic Satanist group called the [[Church of Satan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.churchofsatan.com/images/church-of-satan-logo-black.png&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in 1891, [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] published his Satanic novel, ''[[Là-bas (novel)|Là-bas]]'', which included a detailed description of a [[Black Mass]] which he may have known firsthand was being performed in Paris at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Huysmans | first=Joris-Karl |

 |accessdate=21 May 2008 | nopp=true | page=back cover}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the account may have been based on the masses carried out by [[Étienne Guibourg]], rather than by Huysmans attending himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Laver |
first=James | title=The First Decadent: Being the Strange Life of J.K. Huysmans| publisher=Faber and Faber | year=1954 |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quotations from Huysmans' Black Mass are also used in some Satanic rituals to this day, since it is one of the few sources that purports to describe the words used in a Black Mass. The type of Satanism described in ''Là-bas'' suggests that prayers are said to the [[Devil]], hosts are stolen from the Catholic Church, and sexual acts are combined with [[Roman Catholic]] altar objects and rituals, to produce a variety of Satanism which exalts the Devil and degrades the God of Christianity by inverting Roman Catholic rites. [[George Bataille]] claims that Huysman's description of the Black Mass is “indisputably authentic”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; Not all theistic Satanists today routinely perform the Black Mass, possibly because the Mass is not a part of modern evangelical Christianity in Protestant countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Christiano | first=Kevin |author2=William H. Swatos |author3=Peter Kivisto  |   title=Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments | publisher=Rowman Altamira | year=2001 | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EYtjY7GJav4C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Sociology+of+Religion:+Contemporary+Developments&amp;sig=iMvmLqUPU2kjPdLEjf8W1hF3gpE | accessdate=7 June 2008 | page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so not such an unintentional influence on Satanist practices in those countries.

The earliest verifiable theistic Satanist group was a small group called the [[Ophite Cultus Satanas]], which was created in Ohio in 1948. The Ophite Cultus Satanas was inspired by the ancient [[Ophites|Ophite]] sect of [[Gnosticism]], and the Horned God of [[Wicca]]. The group was dependent upon its founder and leader, and therefore dissolved after his death in 1975.

Michael Aquino published a rare 1970 text of a Church of Satan Black Mass, the ''Missa Solemnis'', in his book ''The Church of Satan'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aquino |first=Michael |title = The Church of Satan |year=2002}}, Appendix 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anton LaVey]] included a different Church of Satan Black Mass, the ''Messe Noire'', in his 1972 book ''[[The Satanic Rituals]]''. LaVey's books on Satanism, which began in the 1960s, were for a long time the few available which advertised themselves as being Satanic, although others detailed the history of witchcraft and Satanism, such as ''The Black Arts'' by [[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Richard Cavendish]] published in 1967 and the classic French work ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft]]'', by [[Jules Michelet]]. Anton LaVey specifically denounced "devil worshippers" and the idea of praying to Satan.

Although non-theistic LaVey Satanism had been popular since the publication of ''The Satanic Bible'' in 1969, theistic Satanism did not start to gain any popularity until the emergence of the [[Order of Nine Angles]] in western England, and its publication of ''The Black Book of Satan'' in 1984. 
&lt;ref&gt;''The Black Book of Satan''. 1984, Thormynd Press, {{ISBN|0-946646-04-X}}. British Library General Reference Collection Cup.815/51, BNB GB8508400&lt;/ref&gt; The next theistic Satanist group to be created was the [[Temple of the Black Light|Misanthropic Luciferian Order]], which was created in Sweden in 1995. The MLO incorporated elements from the Order of Nine Angles, the [[Illuminates of Thanateros]] and [[Qliphoth]]ic [[Kabbalah]].

===Modern-day public image of Satanism and moral panics===
As a [[moral panic]] in the 1980s and the 1990s, there were multiple allegations of sexual abuse and/or sacrifice of children or non-consenting adults in the context of Satanic rituals in what has come to be known as the [[Satanic ritual abuse#As a moral panic|Satanic Panic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Frankfurter | first = D | authorlink =  | title = Evil Incarnate: Rumors of Demonic Conspiracy and Ritual Abuse in History  | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]  | year = 2006 | location = Princeton, NJ  | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0 | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 0-691-11350-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations included the existence of large networks of organized Satanists involved in illegal activities such as murder, child pornography and prostitution. In the United States, the Kern County child abuse cases, [[McMartin preschool trial]] and the West Memphis cases were widely reported. One case took place in Jordan, Minnesota, in which children made allegations of the manufacture of [[child pornography]], ritualistic [[animal sacrifice]], [[coprophagia]], [[urophagia]] and [[infanticide]], at which point the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) was alerted. Twenty-four adults were arrested and charged with acts of sexual abuse, child pornography and other crimes claimed to be related to Satanic ritual abuse; three went to trial, two were acquitted and one convicted. Supreme Court Justice Scalia noted in a discussion of the case that "[t]here is no doubt that some sexual abuse took place in Jordan; but there is no reason to believe it was as widespread as charged", and cited the repeated, coercive techniques used by the investigators as damaging to the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;''Maryland v. Craig'', 497 U.S. 836 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

These iconic cases were launched after children were repeatedly and coercively interrogated by [[social work]]ers, resulting in [[False allegation of child sexual abuse|false allegations of child sexual abuse]]. No evidence was ever found to support any of the allegations of Satanism or ritual abuse, but the panic resulted in numerous wrongful prosecutions. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

According to the [[Ayyavazhi]] sect of [[hinduism]], '''Thretha Yukam''' was the fifth of the [[Eight Yukams]]. In this [[aeon]]   [[Isvaran]] created the fourth piece of the primordial [[Kroni]] as a [[Ten-headed mighty warrior]], as per the request of Mayon, naming him as [[Ravanan]], with ten heads as ten mountains. 

He oppressed all those living on earth by extracting [[Uliyam]] from them. He subdued all the earthly kings and made them pay tributes to him. Suffering under his oppression, Thevarkal sought the help of Mayon, who for the purpose of destroying him, took birth as [[Rama]]n. 

In his death-bed Ravanan was called to repent, which he neglected by saying: "Only with the help of my brother were you able to destroy me". With this episode of killing Ravanan, Thretha yukam came to an end.

'''Urðarbrunnr''' ([[Old Norse]] "Well of Urðr"; either referring to a [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] concept of fate—''[[wyrd|urðr]]''—or the [[norns|norn]] named [[Urðr]]&lt;ref name=SIMEK342&gt;Simek (2007:342).&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Water well|well]] in [[Norse mythology]]. Urðarbrunnr is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. In both sources, the well lies beneath the world tree [[Yggdrasil]], and is associated with a trio of norns  ([[Urðr]], [[Verdandi|Verðandi]], and [[Skuld (Norn)|Skuld]]). In the ''Prose Edda'', Urðarbrunnr is cited as one of [[Numbers in Germanic paganism|three]] wells existing beneath three roots of Yggdrasil that reach into three distant, different lands; the other two wells being [[Hvergelmir]], located beneath a root in [[Niflheim]], and [[Mímisbrunnr]], located beneath a root near the home of the frost [[jötunn|jötnar]]. Scholarly theory and speculation surrounds the well.

==Attestations==
Urðarbrunnr is attested in the following works:
===''Poetic Edda''===
[[Image:The Norns by H. L. M.jpg|thumb|"The Norns" (1901) by Karl Ehrenberg.]]
In the ''Poetic Edda'', Urðarbrunnr is mentioned in stanzas 19 and 20 of the poem ''[[Völuspá]]'', and stanza 111 of the poem ''[[Hávamál]]''. In stanza 19 of  ''Völuspá'', Urðarbrunnr is described as being located beneath Yggdrasil, and that Yggdrasil, an ever-green [[ash-tree]],  is covered with white mud or [[loam]]. Stanza 20 describes that three [[norns]] (Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld) "come from" the well, here described as a "lake", and that this trio of norns then "set down laws, they chose lives, for the sons of men the fates of men."&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON6&gt;Larrington (1999:6).&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanza 111 of ''Hávamál'' has been the matter of much debate and is considered unclear, having been referred to as "mysterious", "obscure and much-debated".&lt;ref name=EVANS86&gt;Evans (1986:26-27, and 124).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Thorpe]] translates the stanza as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Time 'tis to discourse from the preacher's chair.
:By the well of Urd I silent sat,
:I saw and meditated, I listened to men's words.&lt;ref name=THORPE41&gt;Thorpe 1907:41).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Prose Edda''===
In the ''Prose Edda'', Urðarbrunnr is attested in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' (chapters 15, 16, and the beginning of chapter 17), and twice in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]''.

====''Gylfaginning''====
[[Image:Urd_magazine.jpg|thumb|A poster for the Norwegian women's magazine ''Urd'' by [[Andreas Bloch]] and [[Olaf Krohn]].]]
In chapter 15 of ''Gylfaginning'', a book of the ''Prose Edda'', the throned figure of Just-As-High tells [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (described as King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) about Yggdrasil and its roots. Just-As-High describes three roots that support Yggdrasil that stretch a great distance. The third root is located "among the [[Æsir]]", "extends to heaven" and, beneath it, is the "very holy" Urðarbrunnr. Just-As-High details that, every day, the gods ride over the bridge [[Bifröst]] to hold court at the well.&lt;ref name=FAULKES17&gt;Faulkes (1995:17).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] provides more information regarding the well in chapter 16. High says that there are many beautiful places in heaven, and "everywhere there is divine protection around it." There, a beautiful hall stands under the ash (Yggdrasil) near the well (Urðarbrunnr), and from this hall come "three maidens" whose names are Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld. The maidens shape the lives of men, and "we call them norns". High goes on to describe that there are other norns, and their nature.&lt;ref name=FAULKES18&gt;Faulkes (1995:18).&lt;/ref&gt;

Further into chapter 16, High states that norns that dwell by Urðarbrunnr take water from the well and mud that lies around it, and pour it over the Yggdrasil so that its branches do not decay or rot. The water is described as so holy that anything that enters the well will become "as white as the membrane called the skin that lies round the inside of the eggshell." High then quotes stanza 19 of ''Völuspá'', and states that two [[swan]]s feed from the well, from which all other swans descend.&lt;ref name=FAULKES19&gt;Faulkes (1995:19).&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 17 starts off with Gangleri asking what other "chief centres" exist outside of Urðarbrunnr.&lt;ref name=FAULKES19/&gt;

====''Skáldskaparmál''====
Two sections of the book ''Skáldskaparmál'' reference Urðarbrunnr. The first reference is in section 49, where a fragment of a work by the 10th century [[skald]] [[Kormákr Ögmundarson]] is recited in explaining how "Odin's fire" is a [[kenning]] for a sword. The passage reads "A sword is Odin's fire, as Kormak said: Battle raged when the feeder of Grid's steed [wolf], he who waged war, advanced with ringing Gaut [Odin's] fire." and that Urðr "rose from the well."&lt;ref name=FAULKES121&gt;Faulkes (1995:121).&lt;/ref&gt;

Urðarbrunnr is mentioned a second time in section 52 of ''Skáldskaparmál'', this time associated with [[Christ]]. The section states that early skalds once referred to Christ in relation to Urðarbrunnr and [[Rome]], and quotes the late 10th century skald [[Eilífr Goðrúnarson]], who states that "thus has the powerful king of Rome increased his realm with lands of heath-land divinities [giants; i.e. {{linktext|heathen}} lands]" and that Christ is said to have his throne south of Urðarbrunnr.&lt;ref name=FAULKES126&gt;Faulkes (1995:126).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
[[Image:Three Norns by Frølich.jpg|thumb|Three norns at Urðarbrunnr (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]].]]
===Temple at Uppsala===
Parallels have been pointed out between the description of Urðarbrunnr at the base of the world tree Yggdrasil and Christian medieval chronicler [[Adam of Bremen]]'s account of a well at the base of a [[Sacred tree at Uppsala|sacred tree]] at the [[Temple at Uppsala]], Sweden, found in his 11th century work ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]''.&lt;ref name=SIMEK342/&gt;

===Eilífr Goðrúnarson===
Eilífr Goðrúnarson's [[Christianity]]-influenced account of Urðarbrunnr (section 52 of ''Skáldskaparmál'') associates the well with the south and Rome. Theories have been proposed that this description may have some relation to notions of the [[Jordan River]] due to phonetic and typological similarities perceived by Eilífr, though there may be no other causative connection.&lt;ref name=SIMEK342/&gt; Eilífr is otherwise known as a pagan ''[[skald]]'', and this selection has been theorized as describing that, due to directly associating Christ with the well, Christ had taken over responsibility of providence or fate.&lt;ref name=FAULKESB201&gt;Faulkes (1998:201).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14408">'''Wat Thamkrabok''' ({{lang-th|วัดถ้ำกระบอก}}, literally ''Temple of the Bamboo Cave'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[temple]] ([[wat]]) in [[Thailand]], located in the [[Amphoe Phra Phutthabat|Phra Phutthabat district]] of [[Saraburi Province]], [[Thailand]].

The temple was first established as a [[monastery]] in 1957 by the Buddhist nun Mian Parnchand (generally known as Luang Por Yai) and her two nephews, Chamroon and Charoen Parnchand, who had both ordained as monks at Wat Khlong Mao in Lopburi Province, Thailand. Luang Por Chamroon, a former Thai policeman, was the first abbot, although Wat Thamkrabok is not officially a Buddhist temple, but is a "Samnak Song", because it follows the teachings of Luang Por Yai, a woman. Still, the entrance claims it is a [[temple]] or [[Wat]].&lt;ref name="Baird 2013 120–151"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baird|first=Ian G.|title=The monks and the Hmong: The special relationship between the Chao Fa and the Tham Krabok Buddhist Temple in Saraburi Province, Thailand. In Vladimir Tikhonov and Torkel Brekke (eds.), Violent Buddhism – Buddhism and Militarism in Asia in the Twentieth Century.|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=120–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The temple is majestic in its appearance, with two elephants supporting a globe marking its entrance. There are many large Buddha images on the temple grounds.

==Hmong refugees==

Following the end of the [[Vietnam War]], in the late 1970s, Wat Thamkrabok hosted [[Hmong people|Hmong]] [[refugee]]s in a camp on its grounds as result of losing the [[Laotian Civil War|Secret War]], most of whom fled [[Laos]] alleging that they were persecuted by the communist government that has ruled Laos since 1975. Many thousands of the Laotian and Hmong refugees and asylum seekers at Wat Thamkrabok had also sought refuge at the Temple after fleeing forced repatriation efforts at other refugee camps in Thailand, because they did not want to return to the [[Marxist]] government in Laos that they fled. More Lao and Hmong refugees continued to arrive and seek sanctuary at Wat Thamkrabok until over 15,000 Hmong were eventually allowed, after a long policy battle in both the United States and Thailand, to go to the USA in 2004 and 2005 as political refugees, instead of being forced back to Laos.  However, some even moved to the United States as early as in 2001.

In the late 1970s Wat Thamkrabok, and particularly its abbot, Luang Por Chamroon, supported the Hmong armed resistance against the Lao PDR government, particularly the Neo Hom led by General [[Vang Pao]] and other Laotian leaders, independent Chao Fa groups, and one sub-faction of the Chao Fa led by [[Pa Kao Her]].&lt;ref name="Baird 2013 120–151"/&gt;  The Hmong were [[United States]] war allies in the [[Laotian Civil War|Secret War]] against the communist [[Pathet Lao]], the [[Viet Cong]] and [[North Vietnam]].

When several Thailand-based Hmong refugee camps closed due to a lack of financial support in the early 1990s, Lao and Hmong refugees in Thailand fled to the temple to avoid [[repatriation]] to Laos. The population at the temple quickly grew to about 35,000, although it later declined significantly.

Starting in 1993, the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Public Policy Analysis, or [[The Centre for Public Policy Analysis]], (CPPA), and its Executive Director, Philip Smith, made over seven research missions to Wat Thamkrabok and Laotian and Hmong refugee camps in Thailand. Philip Smith, the CPPA, and the [[Lao Veterans of America]], repeatedly conducted U.S. Congressional-backed research missions about the horrific plight of Laotian and Hmong  refugees fleeing forced repatriation and human rights violations in communist Laos and Thailand. These joint U.S. Congressional and CPPA research missions sought to review policy developments in Thailand and Laos, and to convey humanitarian offers of support and assistance to the head Buddhist abbott, temple monks, and Hmong and Laotian refugee leaders, from Members of Congress and international human rights organizations. For over a decade, prominent Members of Congress, in bipartisan fashion, also supported U.S. Congressional-backed research missions by Philip Smith and the CPPA to Wat Thamkrabok, and the Laotian and Hmong refugee camps, along the Mekong River and Thai-Lao border.  Support for these missions came from a bipartisan coalition in the U.S. Congress, including U.S. Congressman [[Steve Gunderson]] (Republican-Wisconsin), U.S. Congressman [[Bruce Vento]] (D-Minnesota), U.S. Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] (D-Minnesota) and others. The findings of these missions were frequently discussed in news stories, and at sessions of the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos held in the U.S. Congress and Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Bartl, Tim, Office of U.S. Congressman Steve Gunderson, and Phillip Smith, Center for Public Policy Analysis, "Report to the Congress of the United States: Fact Finding Mission to Thailand Regarding the Status of Hmong/Lao Refugees and Asylum Seekers - December 28, 1994 to January 2, 1995" Washington, D.C.: House of Representatives, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Center for Public Policy Analysis (3 January 1993),"Laos, Hmong Refugee Crisis: U.S. Congressional Research Missions to Wat Thamkrabok and Lao and Hmong Refugee Camps in Thailand" http://www.centerforpublicpolicyanalysis.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406154059/http://www.centerforpublicpolicyanalysis.org/ |date=2008-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Ben, Washington Times (22 April 1996)"3,500 Laotians head for U.S. after 20 years in Thailand" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56867976.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bivins, Larry, USA TODAY / Gannett News, (12 May 2011) "Hmong veteran calls for GI benefits" http://www.armytimes.com/article/20110512/NEWS/105120336/Hmong-veteran-calls-GI-benefits&lt;/ref&gt;

Wat Thamkrabok and its Hmong refugees drew global attention in the late-1980s and mid-1990s, as they became the subject of a major global political debate over their future, and the future of Lao and Hmong refugees and asylum seekers in Thailand.  The government of [[Thailand]], with support from the [[United Nations]] and the [[Clinton administration]], sought to repatriate the Lao-Hmong at Wat Thamkrabok back to the [[communist]] regime in Laos that the Lao-Hmong refugees fled. This effort drew opposition from several [[human rights]] groups, and some key [[Hmong people|Hmong]] organizations.

Lao and Hmong human scholar and advocate, [[Vang Pobzeb]], of the [[Wisconsin]] and [[Minnesota]]-based Lao Human Rights Council, participated in a number of research missions with Philip Smith and [[The Centre for Public Policy Analysis]], as well as U.S. Congressional offices, including U.S. Congressmen [[Bruce Vento]] and [[Steve Gunderson]], to the Lao and Hmong refugee camps in Thailand and to Wat Thamkrabok during the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;[https://archive.is/20070705214752/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n20_v47/ai_17443642 "Acts of Betrayal: Persecution of Hmong", by Michael Johns, ''National Review'', October 23, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] of Minnesota and others in the U.S. Senate were active in raising concerns about egregious human rights violations in Laos and the plight of Lao and Hmong refugees and asylum seekers who fled Laos to refugee camps in Thailand and to Wat Thamkrabok.

[[Michael Johns (policy analyst)|Michael Johns]], a former [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] foreign policy analyst and aide to former President [[George H. W. Bush]], helped oppose the forced repatriation, labeling it a "betrayal", since many Hmong had aided the United States during the Secret War.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

While some Hmong were repatriated, most were resettled to the [[United States]] in 2004 and 2005, most moving to the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Minnesota]], [[California]], and [[Wisconsin]]. There are presently only a couple of Hmong families living at Wat Thamkrabok.

==Drug rehabilitation ==

Wat Thamkrabok has also received global attention for its [[heroin]] and [[opium]] [[drug rehabilitation]] program, which was started in 1959. Over 100,000 heroin and opium addicts have since gone through the unique Wat Thamkrabok [[Drug detoxification|detox]] program, a program consisting of Buddhist meditation, Asian herbal supplementation used for relaxation, induced vomiting, and the consumption of a secret detoxification potion composed of many different herbs. In 1975, Luang Por Chamrun Parnchand was awarded the prestigious [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for the temple's drug rehabilitation work.

A number of Western drug users have sought treatment for their addictions at Wat Thamkrabok, In 2002 Stuart Brindley&lt;ref&gt;Scoured To The Soul (Guardian 9 November 2002)l&lt;/ref&gt;  became the first methadone addict from the UK to be treated at the monastery while other prominent westerners including British [[punk rock]] musician [[Pete Doherty]],  Irish rock music singer [[Christy Dignam]] of [[Aslan (rock band)|Aslan]], American computer underground personality [[Patrick K. Kroupa]] and British singer songwriter [[Tim Arnold (musician)|Tim Arnold]].

In 2004, [[Tim Arnold (musician)|Tim Arnold]]'s success story was the subject of many news articles in the UK.&lt;ref name="Nauman"&gt;Nauman, Zoe (2010) "{{cite web|url=http://timarnold.co.uk/images/SUNDAYMIRROR.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810030712/http://timarnold.co.uk/images/SUNDAYMIRROR.jpg |archivedate=2011-08-10 |df= }}", [[Sunday Mirror]], 13 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beaumont"&gt;Beaumont, Mark (2004) "{{cite web|url=http://timarnold.co.uk/images/NME-Feature.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810030652/http://timarnold.co.uk/images/NME-Feature.jpg |archivedate=2011-08-10 |df= }}", [[NME]], 5 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his programme Arnold subsequently became a permanent Tham Krabok resident and favourite 'son' of the monastery's abbot, Luang Por Charoen.&lt;ref name="Gagliardi"&gt;Gagliardi, Jason (2004) "{{cite web|url=http://timarnold.co.uk/images/SunTelP2-3-25.07.04.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810030806/http://timarnold.co.uk/images/SunTelP2-3-25.07.04.jpg |archivedate=2011-08-10 |df= }}", [[Sunday Telegraph]], 25 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Because opium used to be commonly grown and, at times, consumed by the Hmong (largely for medicinal purposes) in the highlands of Thailand and Laos, some Hmong refugees have undergone addiction treatment at Wat Thamkrabok. Wat Thamkrabok also supports the detoxification of those addicted to [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[methamphetamines]].

Wat Thamkrabok was believed to have served as a possible center of armed resistance to the Lao government with a limited number of weapons allegedly smuggled to some Hmong and Laotian insurgents and opposition groups in Laos.  Responding to these concerns, the [[Royal Thai Armed Forces|Thai military]] deployed hundreds of troops to surround Wat Thamkrabok in April 2003. This action was undertaken despite elements of the Thai military—many of whose officers were sympathetic to the Laotian and Hmong dissidents, insurgents and resistance fighter groups—allegedly, continuing to actively help to provide weapons and logistical support to Laotian and Hmong groups in Laos who oppose the [[communist]] government in [[Vientiane]].  The Thai military and police fenced the Hmong at Wat Thamkrabok with [[concertina wire]] in an effort to monitor and control entrance to it, before they were able to immigrate to the USA in 2004 and 2005. The area is no longer fenced.

Wat Thamkrabok became an official Wat (Temple) in 2012. Vichien Gitiwanno (Luang Por Vichien) has been entitled as the first abbot of Wat Thamkrabok as an official temple recognized by the Thai Government. The number of patients has reached to 110,312 by the end of 2015. 

==Global intrigue==

Wat Thamkrabok's historic role in harboring Hmong refugees in the 1990s and early 2000s, and its global reputation for unique Buddhist approaches to lifestyle management and detoxification, have made the temple a popular destination for foreign tourists and those seeking help with charitable and drug addiction treatment  in Thailand.  There have, however, been concerns, from some quarters, that Wat Thamkrabok may have played a role as an alleged conduit for weapons and military support to Lao and Hmong military insurgents and dissident groups, who were allegedly engaged in opposition to, and  military conflict with, the communist Pathet Lao government in neighboring Laos as well as military and security forces from the allied [[marxist]] government in [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]]. That alleged military support, and alleged assistance with weapons smuggling,  has, however, from Thai military and other sources, apparently ended at Wat Thamkrabok and elsewhere in Thailand.&lt;ref name="Baird 2013 120–151"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Philip, Center for Public Policy Analysis, CPPA, www.centreforpublicpolicyanalysis.org,(4 July 2004)http://www.centerforpublicpolicyanalysis.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406154059/http://www.centerforpublicpolicyanalysis.org/ |date=2008-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4871">The '''Wooing Group''' (or '''Wohunge Group''') is a term coined by [[W. Meredith Thompson]] to identify the common provenance of four early Middle English prayers and meditations, written in rhythmical, alliterative prose.&lt;ref&gt;W. Meredith Thompson, ''Þe wohunge of Ure Lauerd, Edited from British Museum ms. Cotton Titus D. XVIII, together with On ureisun of Ure Louerde, On wel swuðe God ureisun of God Almihti, On lofsong of Ure Louerde, On lofsong of Ure Lefdi [and] Þe oreisun of Seinte Marie, from the manuscripts in which they occur'', Early English Text Society. Original series, 241 (London: Oxford University Press, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; The particular variety of Middle English in which the group is written is [[AB language]], a written standard of the West Midlands which also characterises the ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'' and the ''[[Katherine Group]]''.&lt;ref name = "Sauer"&gt;Michelle M. Sauer, 'Wooing Group', in: [http://medieval_literature.enacademic.com  ''Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature'' (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The group comprises:&lt;ref&gt;Bella Millett, 'The ''Ancrene Wisse'' Group', in: ''A Companion to Middle English Prose'', ed. by A. S. G. Edwards (Cambridge: Brewer, 2004), 1-18 (p. 5).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Þe Wohunge of ure Laured'' (The Wooing of Our Lord), a meditation 'emphasizing the desirability of Christ as a lover and his sufferings to gain the love of humanity'. (British Library, Titus D sviii, ff. 127r–133r.)
* ''On wel swuðe God Ureisun of God Almihti'' (An Exceedingly Good Orison to God Almighty), also a meditation on the same theme. (British Library, Cotton Nero A. xiv; Lambeth Palace Library, 487 [incomplete].)
* ''On Lofsong of ure Loured'' (A Song of Praise Concerning Our Lord), 'an extended prayer to Christ and the Virgin'. (British Library, Cotton Nero A. xiv.)
* ''On Lofsong of ure Lefdi'' (A Song of Praise Concerning Our Lady), a. k. a. ''Þe Oreisun of Seinte Marie'', 'a free translation of a prayer to the Virgin in Latin verse by [[Marbod of Rennes]] (c. 1025-1133)', the 'Oratio ad sanctum Mariam'. (British Library, Cotton Nero A. xiv.)

'As with the works of the Katherine Group their dissemination seems to have been relatively limited; but the fourteenth-century rhythmical prose treatise ''A Talkyng of the Loue of God'' reflects the influence of two Wooing Group works, the ''Ureisun of God Almihti'' and the ''Wohunge''.'&lt;ref&gt;Bella Millett, 'The ''Ancrene Wisse'' Group', in: ''A Companion to Middle English Prose'', ed. by A. S. G. Edwards (Cambridge: Brewer, 2004), 1-18 (p. 5); cf. Salvina Westra, ed. ''A Talkyng of the Loue of God. Edited from MS Vernon (Bodleian 3938) and Collated with MS Simeon (Brit. Mus. Add. 22283)''. The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the assessment of Michelle M. Sauer,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The pieces are written in lyrical prose, and combine COURTLY LOVE imagery of Christ as the perfect lover-knight with more earthy eroticism. Similarly, the texts combine nuptial metaphors with crucifixion imagery, blending divine marriage with shared divine pain. Jesus is at once the desired spouse and the suffering savior. In particular, the title piece outlines all the qualities that Christ has that make him the perfect spouse, and these are all defined in human terms. Christ is handsome, kind, noble, wealthy, generous, and loving. The other members of the Trinity make only rare appearances. For instance, God the Father is referred to only in the context of providing Jesus with a kingdom. Similarly, the Virgin Mary is invoked as a pure, unstained advocate for the female speaker’s cause, but not fleshed out as an individual figure.&lt;ref name = "Sauer" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Zafarnama.jpg|300px|thumb|The Zafarnama of [[Guru Gobind Singh]]]]
{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}
The '''''Zafarnāma''''' ({{lang-pa|ਜ਼ਫ਼ਰਨਾਮਾ}}, {{lang-fa|{{nastaliq|ظفرنامہ}}}}, lit. ''Epistle of Victory'') was a spiritual  victory letter sent by [[Guru Gobind Singh Ji]] in 1705 to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor of India, [[Aurangzeb]] after the [[Battle of Chamkaur (1704)|Battle of Chamkaur]]. The letter is written in [[Persian language|Persian]] verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guru Gobind Singh: Prophet of peace |isbn=9380213646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guru Gobind Singh Ji sent Bhai Daya Singh to Ahmednagar to give it to Aurangzeb. However it is said that a copy of the ''Zafarnama'', written by himself, was found with the Mahant of Patna Sahib in 1890 and one Babu Jagan Nath made a copy; this copy was somehow misplaced by him. Since Babu Jagan Nath was himself a scholar in [[Persian language]], he could reproduce it from his memory and got it printed in Nagri Parcharni Patrika in Benaras. He is also believed to have sent a copy to Sardar Umrao Singh Shergill in [[Amritsar]] who is said to have given it to Khalsa college and which in turn reproduced in Makhz-e-Twarikh Sikhan. In Punjab newspapers, it first appeared in the Khalsa Samachar of 16 July 1942. Then in 1944, Kapur Singh ICS published it in Urdu Ajit of Lahore under the heading "Fatehnama". It is quite possible that in the process of translations and publications of the ''Zafarnama'' at different stages, some verses were not reproduced correctly and what we have today is not the original ''Zafarnama'' of the Guru in its entirety. The abrupt end of the ''Zafarnama'' also indicates that it is not complete and that some verses have been left out. Objections raised by some scholars on the authenticity of a few verses may be viewed in this context.

In this letter, [[Guru Gobind Singh Ji]] reminds [[Aurangzeb]] how he and his henchmen had broken their oaths sworn upon the [[Quran|Qur'an]]. He also states that in spite of his several sufferings, he had won a moral victory over the Emperor who had broken all his vows. Despite sending a huge army to capture or kill the Guru Ji, the Mughal forces did not succeed in their mission.

In the 111 verses of this notice, Guru Gobind Singh Ji rebukes Aurangzeb for his weaknesses as a human being and for excesses as a leader. [[Guru Gobind Singh]] also confirms his confidence and his unflinching faith in the Almighty even after suffering extreme personal loss of his Father, Mother, and all four of his sons to Aurangzeb's tyranny.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji invited Aurangzeb to meet him in Kangar village near Bathinda (Punjab) and said no need to worry as Brar tribe will not harm him (Aurangzeb) as they are under his command. On the way, there will be no danger to your life, For, the whole tribe of Brars accepts my command. (59){{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Of the 111 verses, the maximum numbers of 34 verses are to praise God; 32 deal with Aurangzeb’s invitation for the Guru Ji to meet him and the Guru's refusal to meet the Emperor&amp;nbsp;– instead the Guru asks Aurangzeb to visit him; 24 verses detail the events in the Battle of Chamkaur, which took place on 22 December 1704; 15 verses reprove Aurangzeb for breaking promise given by him and by his agents to the Guru; In verses 78 and 79, Guru Gobind Singh Ji had also warned Aurangzeb about the resolve of the [[Khalsa]] not to rest till his evil empire is destroyed; 6 verses praise Aurangzeb.

Guru Gobind Singh Ji wrote this letter from the village of Dina in [[Malwa (Punjab)|Malwa region]] of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. ''Guru Gobind Singh'' spent few days at Dina and then moved to Dod, [[Kotkapura]], [[Dhilwan Kalan]], [[Jaitu]], [[Shri Muktsar Sahib]], [[Lakhi Jangal]], and [[Damdama Sahib]]. Guru Gobind Singh's Ji last fight with Mughal Army happened at '''Khidrane Di Dhaab''' now called [[Sri Muktsar Sahib]].

One of the most quoted verses from the ''Zafarnama'' is the following couplet:

:''"Chun kar az hameh heelate dar guzasht,''
:''Halal ast burdan bi-shamsher dast.''
:When all has been tried, yet
:Justice is not in sight,
:It is then right to pick up the sword,
:It is then right to fight"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zafarnama|last=Singh|first=Guru Gobind|publisher=Penguin Books India|year=2011|isbn=9780670085569|location=New Delhi, India|pages=23|translator-last=Sarna|translator-first=Navtej}}&lt;/ref&gt;
