'''Sir Alfred Jules''' "'''Freddie'''" '''Ayer''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} ({{IPAc-en|ɛər}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ayer "Ayer"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 29 October 1910&amp;nbsp;– 27 June 1989),&lt;ref name="BioDict20CPhil"&gt;{{cite book |title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers |year=1996 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |pages=37–39 |isbn=0-415-06043-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually cited as '''A. J. Ayer''', was a British philosopher known for his promotion of [[logical positivism]], particularly in his books ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936) and ''The Problem of Knowledge'' (1956).

He was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Oxford University]], after which he studied the philosophy of logical positivism at the [[University of Vienna]]. From 1933 to 1940 he lectured on philosophy at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://biography.yourdictionary.com/alfred-jules-ayer|title= Alfred Jules Ayer Facts|publisher= Your Dictionary|accessdate = 18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]] Ayer was a [[Special Operations Executive]] and [[MI6]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The politics of apolitical culture: the Congress for Cultural Freedom, the CIA, and post-war American hegemony |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |author=Scott-Smith, Giles |page=109 |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-24445-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was [[Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic|Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic]] at [[University College London]] from 1946 until 1959, after which he returned to Oxford to become [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at [[New College, Oxford|New College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Jules Ayer|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ayer/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=15 April 2016|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1951 to 1952 and [[knight]]ed in 1970. He was known for his advocacy of [[humanism]], and was the second President of the [[British Humanist Association]] (now known as Humanists UK).

== Life ==
Ayer was born in [[St John's Wood]], in north west London, to a wealthy family from continental Europe. His mother, Reine Citroën, was from the Dutch-Jewish family who founded the [[Citroën]] car company in France. His father, Jules Ayer, was a Swiss [[Calvinist]] financier who worked for the [[Rothschild family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A.J. Ayer: A Life |author= Rogers, Ben |publisher= Vintage |location =London |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |pages= |isbn= 978-0-09-953681-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayer was educated at [[Ascham St Vincent's School]], a former boarding preparatory school for boys in the seaside town of [[Eastbourne]] in [[Sussex]], in which he started boarding at the comparatively early age of seven for reasons to do with the [[World War I|First World War]], and [[Eton College]], a boarding school in [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] (near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]) in [[Berkshire]]. It was at Eton that Ayer first became known for his characteristic bravado and precocity. Although primarily interested in furthering his intellectual pursuits, he was very keen on sports, particularly rugby, and reputedly played the [[Eton wall game|Eton Wall Game]] very well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A.J. Ayer: A Life |author= Rogers, Ben |publisher= Vintage |location =London |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |pages=42–44 |isbn= 978-0-09-953681-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final examinations at Eton, Ayer came second in his year, and first in classics. In his final year, as a member of Eton's senior council, he unsuccessfully campaigned for the abolition of [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] at the school. He won a classics scholarship to [[Christ Church, Oxford]].

After graduation from Oxford University Ayer spent a year in Vienna, returned to England and published his first book, ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'' in 1936.  The first exposition in English of [[Logical Positivism]] as newly developed by the [[Vienna Circle]], this made Ayer at age 26 the 'enfant terrible' of British philosophy.  In the Second World War he served as an officer in the Welsh Guards, chiefly in intelligence (Special Operations Executive (SOE) and [[MI6]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/21/mi6-first-authorised-history |location=London |work =The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Norton-Taylor |title=Graham Greene, Arthur Ransome and Somerset Maugham all spied for Britain, admits MI6 |date=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;).   Ayer was commissioned [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Welsh Guards]] from Officer Cadet Training Unit on 21 September 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34957 |supp=y|page=5776|date=27 September 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war he briefly returned to [[Oxford University]] where he became a fellow and [[Dean of Wadham College]]. He thereafter taught philosophy at [[London University]] from 1946 until 1959, when he also started to appear on radio and television. He was an extrovert and social mixer who liked dancing and attending the clubs in London and New York. He was also obsessed with sport: he had played rugby for Eton, and was a noted cricketer and a keen supporter of [[Tottenham Hotspur]] football team. For an academic, Ayer was an unusually well-connected figure in his time, with close links to 'high society' and the establishment. Presiding over Oxford high-tables, he is often described as charming, but at times he could also be intimidating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Iris Murdoch as I knew her |first=A. N. |last=Wilson |publisher= Hutchinson |year=2003 |page=156 |location =London |isbn= 978-0-09-174246-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayer was married four times to three women.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{harvnb|Wollheim|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first marriage was from 1932–1941 to (Grace Isabel) Renée (d. 1980), who subsequently married philosopher [[Stuart Hampshire]], Ayer's friend and colleague.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; In 1960 he married [[Dee Wells|Alberta Constance (Dee) Wells]], with whom he had one son.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Ayer's marriage to Wells was dissolved in 1983 and that same year he married Vanessa Salmon, former wife of politician [[Nigel Lawson]]. She died in 1985 and in 1989 he remarried Dee Wells, who survived him.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Ayer also had a daughter with Hollywood columnist [[Sheilah Graham Westbrook]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

From 1959 to his retirement in 1978, Sir Alfred held the Wykeham Chair, Professor of Logic at Oxford. He was knighted in 1970.

Ayer died on 27 June 1989. From 1980 to 1989, Ayer lived at 51 York Street, [[Marylebone]], where a memorial plaque was unveiled on 19 November 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |title=City of Westminster green plaques|accessdate=2011-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |archivedate=16 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical ideas ==
In ''Language, Truth and Logic'' (1936), Ayer presents the [[verification principle]] as the only valid basis for philosophy.  Unless logical or empirical verification is possible, statements like "God exists" or "charity is good" are not true or untrue but meaningless, and may thus be excluded or ignored.  Religious language in particular was unverifiable and as such literally nonsense. He also criticises C. A. Mace's opinion&lt;ref&gt;"Representation and Expression," Analysis, Vol.1, No.3; "Metaphysics and Emotive Language," Analysis Vol. II, nos. 1 and 2,&lt;/ref&gt; that metaphysics is a form of intellectual poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Language, Truth and Logic 1946/1952, New York/Dover&lt;/ref&gt; The stance that a belief in "God" denotes no verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred to as [[Ignosticism|igtheism]] (for example, by [[Paul Kurtz]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The New Skepticism: Inquiry and Reliable Knowledge |page=194 |author=Kurtz, Paul |authorlink=Paul Kurtz |year=1992 |publisher=Prometheus |location =Buffalo, NY |isbn= 978-0-87975-766-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years Ayer reiterated that he did not believe in God&lt;ref&gt;"I do not believe in God. It seems to me that theists of all kinds have very largely failed to make their concept of a deity intelligible; and to the extent that they have made it intelligible, they have given us no reason to think that anything answers to it." Ayer, A.J. (1966). "What I Believe," ''Humanist'', Vol.81 (8) August, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; and began to refer to himself as an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;"I trust that my remaining an atheist will allay the anxieties of my fellow supporters of the [[British Humanist Association]], the [[Rationalist Press Association]] and the [[South Place Ethical Society]]." (Ayer 1989, p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt; He followed in the footsteps of [[Bertrand Russell]] by debating with the Jesuit scholar [[Frederick Copleston]] on the topic of religion.

Ayer's version of emotivism divides "the ordinary system of ethics" into four classes:
#"Propositions that express definitions of ethical terms, or judgements about the legitimacy or possibility of certain definitions"
#"Propositions describing the phenomena of moral experience, and their causes"
#"Exhortations to moral virtue"
#"Actual ethical judgments"&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 103&lt;/ref&gt;
He focuses on propositions of the first class—moral judgments—saying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered in [[normative ethics]] as opposed to [[meta-ethics]]) are too concrete for ethical philosophy.

Ayer argues that moral judgments cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with [[ethical intuitionism|ethical intuitionists]]. But he differs from intuitionists by discarding appeals to intuition of non-empirical moral truths as "worthless" &lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 106&lt;/ref&gt; since the intuition of one person often contradicts that of another. Instead, Ayer concludes that ethical concepts are "mere pseudo-concepts":

{{quote|The presence of an ethical symbol in a proposition adds nothing to its factual content. Thus if I say to someone, "You acted wrongly in stealing that money," I am not stating anything more than if I had simply said, "You stole that money." In adding that this action is wrong I am not making any further statement about it. I am simply evincing my moral disapproval of it. It is as if I had said, "You stole that money," in a peculiar tone of horror, or written it with the addition of some special exclamation marks. … If now I generalise my previous statement and say, "Stealing money is wrong," I produce a sentence that has no factual meaning—that is, expresses no proposition that can be either true or false. … I am merely expressing certain moral sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 107&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Between 1945 and 1947, together with Russell and [[George Orwell]], he contributed a series of articles to ''[[Polemic (magazine)|Polemic]]'', a short-lived British "Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics" edited by the ex-Communist [[Humphrey Slater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/arthistorical-notes-where-are-the-hirsts-of-the-1930s-now-1184514.html |title= Where are the Hirsts of the 1930s now? |work=The Independent |location =London |date=13 November 1998 |author=Buckman, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Absent Minds"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=j-OjW2JvVfAC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;vq=ayer&amp;cad=1_1#PPA396,M1 |title= Absent Minds: Intellectuals in Britain |author= Collini, Stefan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn= 978-0-19-929105-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayer was closely associated with the British [[secular humanism|humanist]] movement. He was an Honorary Associate of the [[Rationalist Press Association]] from 1947 until his death. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021801/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf| archivedate= 10 May 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, he became the first president of the Agnostics' Adoption Society and in the same year succeeded [[Julian Huxley]] as president of the [[British Humanist Association]], a post he held until 1970. In 1968 he edited ''The Humanist Outlook'', a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism. In addition he was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=4 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archivedate=20 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught or lectured several times in the United States, including serving as a visiting professor at [[Bard College]] in the fall of 1987. At a party that same year held by fashion designer [[Fernando Sanchez]], Ayer, then 77, confronted [[Mike Tyson]] who was forcing himself upon the (then) little-known model [[Naomi Campbell]]. When Ayer demanded that Tyson stop, the boxer said: "Do you know who the fuck I am? I'm the heavyweight champion of the world," to which Ayer replied: "And I am the former [[Wykeham Professor of Logic]]. We are both pre-eminent in our field. I suggest that we talk about this like rational men". Ayer and Tyson then began to talk, while Naomi Campbell slipped out.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D26bGPQw0GsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A.+J.+Ayer&amp;ei=ECIPTKLSL4WyzgSbpJiaCg&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=naomi&amp;f=false Rogers (1999), p. 344].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Near-death experience ===
In 1988, shortly before his death, Ayer wrote an article entitled, "What I saw when I was dead",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayer |first=A. J. |url=http://www.philosopher.eu/others-writings/a-j-ayer-what-i-saw-when-i-was-dead/ |title=What I Saw When I Was Dead |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing an unusual [[near-death experience]]. Of the experience, Ayer first said that it "slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death ... will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lougrhan |first=Gerry |title=Can There Be Life After Life? Ask the Atheist! |date=18 March 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few days later he revised this, saying "what I should have said is that my experiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after death, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dennett |first=Daniel C. |url=http://edge.org/3rd_culture/dennett06/dennett06_index.html |title=THANK GOODNESS! |publisher=Edge.org |date=3 November 2006 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Dr Jeremy George, the attending physician, claimed that Ayer had confided to him: "I saw a Divine Being. I'm afraid I'm going to have to revise all my books and opinions." Ayer's son Nick, however, said that he had never mentioned this to him though he did find his father's words to be extraordinary, and said he had long felt there was something possibly suspect about his father's version of his near death experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cash |first=William |url=http://variousenthusiasms.wordpress.com/2009/04/28/did-atheist-philosopher-see-god-when-he-died-by-william-cash/ |title=Did atheist philosopher see God when he 'died'? |publisher=National Post |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Ayer is best known for popularising the [[verification principle]], in particular through his presentation of it in ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936). The principle was at the time at the heart of the debates of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]] which Ayer visited as a young guest. Others, including the leading light of the circle, [[Moritz Schlick]], were already offering their own papers on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlick |first=Moritz |url=http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/moritz.htm |title=Unanswerable Questions |publisher=The Philosopher |volume=XIII |year=1935 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayer's own formulation was that a sentence can only be meaningful if it has verifiable [[empirical]] import, otherwise it is either "[[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytical]]" if [[Tautology (logic)|tautologous]], or "metaphysical" (i.e. meaningless, or "literally senseless"). He started to work on the book at the age of 23&lt;ref&gt;page ix, "Language, Truth and Logic", Penguin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and it was published when he was 26. Ayer's philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the Vienna Circle and [[David Hume]]. His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes ''Language, Truth and Logic'' essential reading on the tenets of [[logical empiricism]]– the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century [[analytic philosophy]], and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world. In it, Ayer also proposed that the distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves itself into a distinction between 'different types of perceptible behaviour',&lt;ref&gt;page 140, ''Language, Truth and Logic'', Penguin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; an argument which anticipates the [[Turing test]] published in 1950 to test a machine's capability to demonstrate intelligence.

Ayer wrote two books on the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], ''Russell and Moore: The Analytic Heritage'' (1971) and ''Russell'' (1972). He also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of [[David Hume]] and a short biography of [[Voltaire]].

Ayer was a strong critic of the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]]. As a logical positivist Ayer was in conflict with Heidegger's proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence. These he felt were completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis. This sort of philosophy was an unfortunate strain in modern thought. He considered Heidegger to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.

In 1972–1973 Ayer gave the [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[University of St Andrews]], later published as ''The Central Questions of Philosophy''. In the preface to the book, he defends his selection to hold the lectureship on the basis that Lord Gifford wished to promote "[[natural theology]]", in the widest sense of that term', and that non-believers are allowed to give the lectures if they are "able reverent men, true thinkers, sincere lovers of and earnest inquirers after truth".&lt;ref&gt;''The Central Questions of Philosophy'', p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; He still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists: that large parts of what was traditionally called "philosophy"– including the whole of [[metaphysics]], theology and [[aesthetics]]– were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.

In ''The Concept of a Person and Other Essays'' (1963), Ayer heavily criticized [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[private language argument]].

Ayer's sense-data theory in ''Foundations of Empirical Knowledge'' was famously criticised by fellow Oxonian [[J. L. Austin]] in ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Austin)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'', a landmark 1950s work of common language philosophy. Ayer responded to this in the essay "Has Austin Refuted the Sense-data Theory?", which can be found in his ''Metaphysics and Common Sense'' (1969).

== Awards ==
He was awarded a Knighthood as [[Knight Bachelor]] in the London Gazette on 1 January 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=44999 |supp=y|page=1|date=30 December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Andras Felkai Academic Award''' is a [[scholarship]] intended to support young [[Hungary|Hungarian]] economics students to obtain a university degree or further studies. The scholarship is available for both undergraduate studies and graduate studies in Hungary and abroad. Eligible expenses which may be covered include tuition fees, exams, textbooks, teaching aids and the related costs of travel and accommodation, etc.

The aim of the Andras Felkai Academic Award is to contribute to the Hungarian economy and the financial sector with highly trained professionals who, like Andras Felkai, are characterized by a positive attitude, competence and international-mindedness. In order to achieves its aims the Award supports the studies of talented students and young professionals selected by the committee.

'''Andras Felkai''' was a prominent and respected figure of the Hungarian financial sector. He was born in 1956 in [[Budapest]], began his studies in [[Germany]], and then lived with his family in [[India]] for many years. He obtained his diploma at [[Dresden University of Technology|Dresden University]] of Technology Traffic and Transportation Psychology, Faculty of Economics and Business Administration. From 1980 until 1988 he worked at CIB Bank and left the bank as the leader of the division of International Corporate Relations. In 1988 he was appointed the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, later the Chief Executive Officer of Inter-Europa Bank. In the middle of the 1990s he worked at the subsidiary (branch?) of the São Paulo Bank in Vienna, then from the end of the year he was President and Chief Executive Officer of European Commercial Bank. After 1998 when Citibank bought the financial institute he played executive roles in Citibank Hungary. In the subsequent years, he successfully led his own consulting company, and was a member of the board of directors of [[Synergon Information Systems]] plc. He died in an aircraft accident with other members of the Management Board in June 2001.

Citibank Hungary, together with the Foundation for Developing Financial Culture, co-founded the Andras Felkai Academic Award in 2002. The family of Andras Felkai, several institutions and individual donors have also contributed to the fund.

The Andras Felkai Academic Award Fund is a non-profit organization and its financial support enjoys tax incentives.

The [http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/aro/ '''Arctic Research Office''' (ARO)] a division of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) run under the auspices of the [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR).

ARO is the focal point for NOAA's research in the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]], [[Bering Sea]], [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] regions.

In 1996, the [[Congress of the United States]] appropriated one million [[USD]] to support an Arctic Research Initiative within NOAA. In cooperation with the [[Cooperative Institute for Arctic Research]], NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research used those funds to support research projects in two principal areas: natural variability of the Western Arctic/Bering Sea ecosystem, and anthropogenic influences on the Western Arctic/Bering Sea ecosystem.  Support for the Arctic Research Initiative is ongoing.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The office administers the funds from the Arctic Research Initiative.  It represents NOAA on the [[Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee]], leads U.S. involvement in the [[Arctic Monitoring &amp; Assessment Programme]], and provides a point of contact between NOAA and the [[Cooperative Institute and Assessment Program]] and the [[International Arctic Research Center]].

[[File:Reel-to-ReelTapeBigHub.agr.jpg|thumb|[[Magnetic tape]] was commonly used to create master copies.]]
'''Mastering''', a form of [[audio post production]], is the process of preparing and transferring recorded audio from a source containing the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|final mix]] to a [[data storage device]] (the master), the source from which all copies will be produced (via methods such as pressing, duplication or [[Replication (optical media)|replication]]). In recent years [[digital master]]s have become usual, although analog masters, such as audio tapes, are still being used by the manufacturing industry, notably by a few engineers who have chosen to specialize in analog mastering.

Mastering requires critical listening; however, software tools exist to facilitate the process. Results still depend upon the intent of the engineer, the accuracy of the speaker monitors, and the listening environment. [[Mastering engineer]]s may also need to apply corrective equalization and dynamic compression in order to optimise sound translation on all playback systems.&lt;ref name="mixmagazine" /&gt; It is standard practice to make a copy of a master recording, known as a safety copy, in case the master is lost, damaged or stolen.

==History==

===Pre-1940s===
In the earliest days of the recording industry, all phases of the recording and mastering process were entirely achieved by mechanical processes. Performers sang and/or played into a large acoustic horn and the master recording was created by the direct transfer of acoustic energy from the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] of the recording horn to the [[mastering lathe]], typically located in an adjoining room. The cutting head, driven by the energy transferred from the horn, inscribed a modulated groove into the surface of a rotating cylinder or disc.&lt;ref name=Auld&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.recordingmag.com/resources/resourceDetail/109.html |title=Mastering Then and Now |author=Robert Auld |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These masters were usually made from either a soft metal alloy or from [[wax]]; this gave rise to the colloquial term ''waxing'', referring to the cutting of a record.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_UDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=New Technique Aids LP Waxing |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=1950-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the introduction of the [[microphone]] and [[electronic amplifier]] in the mid-1920s, the mastering process became electro-mechanical, and electrically driven mastering lathes came into use for cutting master discs (the cylinder format by then having been superseded). Until the introduction of tape recording, master recordings were almost always cut [[Direct to disc recording|direct-to-disc]].&lt;ref name=Auld/&gt; Only a small minority of recordings were mastered using previously recorded material sourced from other discs.

===Emergence of magnetic tape===
In the late 1940s, the recording industry was revolutionized by the introduction of [[magnetic tape]]. Magnetic tape was invented for recording sound by [[Fritz Pfleumer]] in 1928 in Germany, based on the invention of [[magnetic wire recording]] by [[Valdemar Poulsen]] in 1898.  Not until the end of [[World War II]] could the technology be found outside Europe. The introduction of magnetic tape recording enabled master discs to be cut separately in time and space from the actual recording process.&lt;ref name=Auld/&gt;

Although tape and other technical advances dramatically improved audio quality of commercial recordings in the post-war years, the basic constraints of the electro-mechanical mastering process remained, and the inherent physical limitations of the main commercial recording media—the 78 rpm disc and later the 7-inch 45 rpm single and 33-1/3 rpm [[Gramophone record|LP record]]—meant that the audio quality, [[dynamic range]],{{efn|Dynamic range was limited by the fact that if the mastering level was set too high, the cutting head might be damaged during the cutting process or the stylus may jump out of the groove during playback.&lt;ref name=Auld/&gt;}} and running time{{efn|Running times were constrained by the diameter of the disc and the density with which grooves could be inscribed on the surface without cutting into each other.}} of master discs were still limited compared to later media such as the [[compact disc]].

===Electro-mechanical mastering process===
From the 1950s until the advent of digital recording in the late 1970s, the mastering process typically went through several stages. Once the studio recording on multi-track tape was complete, a final [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]] was prepared and dubbed down to the master tape, usually either a single-track [[Monaural|mono]] or two-track [[stereo]] tape. Prior to the cutting of the master disc, the master tape was often subjected to further electronic treatment by a specialist [[mastering engineer]]. 

After the advent of tape it was found that, especially for pop recordings, master recordings could be made so that the resulting record would sound better. This was done by making fine adjustments to the amplitude of sound at different frequency bands ([[Equalization (audio)|equalization]]) prior to the cutting of the master disc. Record mastering became a highly prized and skilled craft, and it was widely recognized that good mastering could make or break a commercial pop recording. As a result, the independent mastering studio was born. Early independent mastering engineers included [[Doug Sax]], [[Bob Ludwig]], [[Bob Katz]] and [[Bernie Grundman]] and Denny Purcell.&lt;ref name=Auld/&gt;

In large recording companies such as [[EMI]], the mastering process was usually controlled by specialist staff technicians who were conservative in their work practices. These big companies were often reluctant to make changes to their recording and production processes. For example, EMI was very slow in taking up innovations in [[multi-track recording]]{{efn|In [[multi-track recording]] each signal input is recorded to its own track on a multi-track recorder. This multi-track tape is mixed down to a mono or stereo master tape. A multi-track tape may be remixed many times, in different ways, by different engineers, giving the possibility of several masters (mono version, stereo version, LP version, AM radio version, single version, etc.).}} and they did not install 8-track recorders in their [[Abbey Road Studios]] until the late 1960s, more than a decade after the first commercial 8-track recorders were installed by American independent studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=George|authorlink1=George Martin|last2=Hornsby|first2=Jeremy|title=All you need is ears|year=1994|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-11482-6|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital technology===
[[File:Optimum-mix-levels-for-mast.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Optimum Digital Levels with respect to the Full Digital Scale (dBFSD)]]
In the 1990s, electro-mechanical processes were largely superseded by digital technology, with digital recordings stored on [[hard disk drive]]s or digital tape and mastered to [[CD]]. The [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) became common in many mastering facilities, allowing the off-line manipulation of recorded audio via a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).  Although many digital processing tools are common during mastering, it is also very common to use analog media and processing equipment for the mastering stage. Just as in other areas of audio, the benefits and drawbacks of [[Comparison of analog and digital recording|digital technology compared to analog technology]] are still a matter for debate. However, in the field of audio mastering, the debate is usually over the use of digital versus analog signal processing rather than the use of digital technology for storage of audio.&lt;ref name="mixmagazine"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://mixonline.com/recording/mastering/audio_issues_modern_mastering |work=Mix Magazine |title=Issues in Modern Mastering |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524113354/http://mixonline.com/recording/mastering/audio_issues_modern_mastering/ |archive-date=May 24, 2007 |date=May 1, 2006 |author=Blair Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital systems have higher performance and allow mixing to be performed at lower maximum levels. With peaks between -3 and -9 dBFS on a mix, the mastering engineer has enough [[Headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]] to process and produce a final master.&lt;ref name="bob_katz"&gt;[http://www.digido.com/bob-katz/mixing-tips-and-tricks.html Bob Katz Mixing Tips] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827154625/http://www.digido.com/bob-katz/mixing-tips-and-tricks.html |date=August 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to allow enough headroom for the mastering engineer's work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdmusicmastering.com/how-much-headroom-for-mastering.html How much headroom for mastering?] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20130119000648/http://cdmusicmastering.com/how-much-headroom-for-mastering.html |date=January 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduction of headroom by the mix or mastering engineer has resulted in a [[loudness war]] in commercial recordings.&lt;ref name="Shelvock" /&gt;

== Process ==
[[File:Manleyvarimu.jpg|thumb|A common mastering processor for [[dynamic range compression]]]]
The source material, ideally at the original resolution, is processed using [[equalization (audio)|equalization]], [[Dynamic range compression|compression]], [[limiting]] and other processes. Additional operations, such as editing, specifying the gaps between tracks, adjusting level, fading in and out, [[Audio noise reduction|noise reduction]] and other signal restoration and enhancement processes can also be applied as part of the mastering stage.&lt;ref name="Shelvock"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Audio Mastering as Musical Practice|last = Shelvock|first = Matt|publisher = ETDR: University of Western Ontario|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Ontario, Canada|pages = 1–72|url = http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1709&amp;context=etd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source material is put in the proper order, commonly referred to as assembly (or 'track') sequencing. These operations prepare the music for either digital or analog, e.g. vinyl, replication.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

If the material is destined for vinyl release, additional processing, such as dynamic range reduction or frequency dependent stereo–to–mono fold-down and equalization, may be applied to compensate for the limitations of that medium. Finally, for compact disc release, Start of Track, End of Track, and Indexes are defined for disc navigation. Subsequently, it is rendered either to a physical medium, such as a CD-R or DVD-R, or to computer files, such as a [[Disc Description Protocol]] (DDP) file set or an ISO file. The specific medium varies, depending on the intended release format of the final product. For [[digital audio]] releases, there is more than one possible master medium, chosen based on replication factory requirements or record label security concerns. Regardless of what delivery method is chosen, the replicator will transfer the audio to a [[Compact Disc manufacturing|glass master]] that will generate metal stampers for replication.

The process of audio mastering varies depending on the specific needs of the audio to be processed. Mastering engineers need to examine the types of input media, the expectations of the source producer or recipient, the limitations of the end medium and process the subject accordingly. General rules of thumb can rarely be applied.

Steps of the process typically include the following:
# Transferring the recorded audio tracks into the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).
# Sequence the separate songs or tracks  as they will appear on the final release.
# Adjust the length of the silence between songs.
# Process or "sweeten" audio to maximize the sound quality for the intended medium (e.g. applying specific EQ for vinyl).
# Transfer the audio to the final master format (CD-ROM, half-inch reel tape, PCM 1630 U-matic tape, etc.).

Examples of possible actions taken during mastering:&lt;ref name="Shelvock" /&gt;
# Editing minor flaws.
# Applying [[noise reduction]] to eliminate clicks, dropouts, hum and hiss.
# Adjusting stereo width.
# Adding ambience.
# Equalize audio across tracks for the purpose of optimized frequency distribution.
# Adjust volume.
# Dynamic range compression or expansion.
# [[Limiter|Peak limit]].
# [[Dither]].

&lt;!--These topics are covered more comprehensively and in more accessible terms in the second paragraph of this section. Perhaps better to incorporate any new contribution there than to dangle it here--&gt;To finish mastering a CD, track markers must be inserted, along with [[International Standard Recording Code]] (ISRC) and other information necessary to replicate a CD. Vinyl LP and cassettes have their own pre-duplication requirements for a finished master.

==Significance==
&lt;!--I'm not convinced of the significance of this bit but better to move it here for review than have it dangling at the end of the History section for no apparent reason--&gt;
Mastering has a special significance for house, techno and other styles of electronic dance music:
{{quote|...the product of mastering, regardless of the type of format, is re-actualised into a performance in the hands of the DJ. In this regard, the shift from vinyl records to digital formats in many DJ scenes and the appearance of new digital formats for DJs have encouraged new practices also among mastering engineers, whose targets are not only music listeners but, specifically, music performers as well.&lt;ref&gt;Nardi, Carlo (2014).

The '''Belchen System''' refers to five mountains with the name [[Belchen (disambiguation)|Belchen]] around the [[tripoint]] of [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Switzerland]] that may have been used by the [[Celts]] as a [[solar calendar]]. The term is an extension of the '''Belchen Triangle'''.

== Geographical description ==
The heart of the Belchen System is the southernmost mountain of the [[Vosges]], the [[Alsatian Belchen]] (''Elsässer Belchen'' or ''Ballon d'Alsace'', 1,247&amp;nbsp;metres). Seventy three kilometres due east is the [[Black Forest Belchen]] (''Schwarzwälder Belchen'', 1,414&amp;nbsp;metres), which is only 167&amp;nbsp;metres higher and over which the sun rises at the [[equinox]]es, i.e. at the beginning of spring and autumn. Conversely, the sun sets over the Alsatian Belchen on these days when seen from the Black Forest Belchen.

From the Alsatian Belchen, at the time of the [[summer solstice]], the sun rises over [[Little Belchen]] (''Kleiner Belchen'' or ''Petit Ballon'', 1,272&amp;nbsp;metres), 27&amp;nbsp;kilometres away to the northeast. At the [[winter solstice]] it rises over the [[Swiss Belchen]] (''Schweizer Belchen'' or ''Belchenflue'', 1,099 metres), 88&amp;nbsp;kilometres to the southeast. Thus from the Alsatian Belchen the start of all four [[astronomical season]]s is defined.

In addition, the sun rises over the highest mountain of the Vosges, the [[Great Belchen]] (''Großer Belchen'' or ''Grand Ballon'', 1,424 metres) 21&amp;nbsp;kilometres to the northeast, on 1 May.

The region of the Belchen System is known today as the [[Upper Rhine]], the [[Regio Basiliensis]], the [[Dreiland]] or [[RegioTriRhena]].

[[File:STS-103 Reflection on astronaut's visor.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Laurel van der Wal.jpg|thumb|[[Laurel van der Wal]], head of bioastronautics at [[Space Technology Laboratories]], 1961]]
'''Bioastronautics''' is a specialty area of [[biology|biological]] and [[astronautics|astronautical]] research which encompasses numerous aspects of biological, behavioral, and medical concern governing humans and other living organisms in a [[space flight]] environment; and includes design of payloads, [[Space colonization|space habitat]]s, and [[life support]] systems.  In short, it spans the study and support of life in [[space]].

Bioastronautics includes many similarities with its sister discipline [[astronautical hygiene]]; they both study the hazards that humans may encounter during a space flight.  However, astronautical hygiene differs in many respects e.g. in this discipline, once a hazard is identified, the exposure risks are then assessed and the most effective measures determined to prevent or control exposure and thereby protect the health of the astronaut.  Astronautical hygiene is an applied scientific discipline that requires knowledge and experience of many fields including bioastronautics, space medicine, ergonomics etc.  The skills of astronautical hygiene are already being applied for example, to characterise moon dust and design the measures to mitigate exposure during lunar exploration, to develop accurate chemical monitoring techniques and use the results in the setting SMACs.    

Of particular interest from a biological perspective are the effects of reduced gravitational force felt by inhabitants of spacecraft.  Often referred to as "[[microgravity]]", the lack of sedimentation, buoyancy, or convective flows in fluids results in a more quiescent cellular and intercellular environment primarily driven by chemical gradients.  Certain functions of organisms are mediated by gravity, such as [[gravitropism]] in plant roots and negative gravitropism in plant stems, and without this stimulus growth patterns of organisms onboard spacecraft often diverge from their terrestrial counterparts.  Additionally, metabolic energy normally expended in overcoming the force of gravity remains available for other functions.  This may take the form of accelerated growth in organisms as diverse as worms like ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' to miniature [[parasitoid wasp]]s such as ''Spangia endius''.  It may also be used in the augmented production of [[secondary metabolites]] such as the vinca alkaloids [[Vincristine]] and [[Vinblastine]] in the [[rosy periwinkle]] (''[[Catharanthus roseus]]''), whereby space grown specimens often have higher concentrations of these constituents that on earth are present in only trace amounts.

From an engineering perspective, facilitating the delivery and exchange of air, food, and water, and the processing of waste products is also challenging.  The transition from expendable physicochemical methods to sustainable bioregenerative systems that function as a robust miniature ecosystem is another goal of bioastronautics in facilitating long duration space travel.  Such systems are often termed [[Closed Ecological Life Support Systems]] (CELSS).

From a medical perspective, long duration space flight also has physiological impacts on astronauts.  Accelerated bone decalcification, similar to [[osteopenia]] and [[osteoporosis]] on Earth, is just one such condition.  Study of these effects is useful not only in advancing methods for safe habitation of and travel through space, but also in uncovering ways to more effectively treat the related terrestrial ailments.

[[NASA]]'s [[Johnson Space Center]] in Houston, Texas maintains a Bioastronautics Library ([http://library.jsc.nasa.gov/libweb/Library%20Web%20Documents/Library%20map.pdf map]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}). The one-room facility provides a collection of textbooks, reference books, conference proceedings, and academic journals related to bioastronautics topics. Because the library is located within secure government property (not part of [[Space Center Houston]], the official visitors center of JSC), it is not generally accessible to the public.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3590">In [[biology]], '''biological specificity''' is the tendency of a characteristic such as a [[behavior]] or a [[biochemical]] variation to occur in a particular [[species]]. 

Biochemist [[Linus Pauling]] stated that "Biological specificity is the set of characteristics of living organisms or constituents of living organisms of being special or doing something special. Each animal or plant species is special. It differs in some way from all other species... biological specificity is the major problem about understanding life."&lt;ref name="Pauling"&gt;[[Linus Pauling]], Barbara Marinacci, ''Linus Pauling in His Own Words: Selections From His Writings, Speeches and Interviews'', (1995), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subtopics==
Characteristics may further be described as being '''interspecific''', '''intraspecific''', and '''conspecific'''.
===Interspecific===
'''Interspecificity''' (literally ''between/among species''), or being '''interspecific''', describes issues between individuals of separate [[species]]. These may include:
* [[Interspecies communication]], communication between different species of animals, plants, fungi or bacteria
* [[Interspecific competition]], when individuals of different species compete for the same resource in an ecosystem
* [[Interspecific feeding]], when adults of one species feed the young of another species
* [[Interspecific hybrid]]ization
* [[Biological interaction|Interspecific interaction]], the effects organisms in a community have on one another
* [[Interspecific pregnancy]], pregnancy involving an embryo or fetus belonging to another species than the carrier
===Intraspecific===
'''Intraspecificity''' (literally ''within species''), or being '''intraspecific''', describes behaviors, [[biochemical]] variations and other issues within individuals of a single [[species]]. These may include:
* [[Intraspecific antagonism]], when individuals of the same species are hostile to one another
* [[Intraspecific competition]], when individuals or groups of individuals from the same species compete for the same resource in an ecosystem
* [[Intraspecific hybrid|Intraspecific hybridization]]
* [[Intraspecific mimicry]]
===Conspecific===
{{Anchor|conspecificdefinition}}Two or more individual [[organism]]s, [[population]]s, or [[taxa]] are '''conspecific''' if they belong to the same [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Conspecificity|title=Conspecificity|publisher=Biology online|accessdate= 5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where different species can interbreed and their gametes compete, the conspecific gametes take precedence over heterospecific gametes. This is known as conspecific [[sperm precedence]], or conspecific pollen precedence in plants.
===Heterospecific===
The [[antonym]] of conspecificity is the term '''heterospecificity''': two individuals are heterospecific if they are considered to belong to different biological species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Heterospecificity|title=Heterospecificity|publisher=Biology online|accessdate= 5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Christ at the Sea of Galilee''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Tintoretto|Jacopo Tintoretto]]. The painting depicts [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] raises a hand toward the [[apostles]], who appear in a boat amid hostile waves at sea. It is an example of [[mannerism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Christ at the Sea of Galilee| accessdate=2018-04-17| publisher=Aaron Art Prints| url=http://www.aaronartprints.org/tintoretto-christattheseaofgalilee.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; a European art style that exaggerates proportion and favors compositional tension. This can be seen in the expressive postures of the figures and the muted, yet intense color of the sea and sky.

Tintoretto had a mostly [[Venice|Venetian]] audience and was known for painting scenes of Venice, but this painting departs from this path. Additionally, the scene was made to look overly dramatic rather than realistic. The paint is thin and Tintoretto uses extreme highlights, intensifying the darkness and light that seems to come from a compressed and directed light source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Muhlberger| first=Richard| title=The Bible in Art: The New Testament| publisher=New York: Portland House| year=1990| pages=82-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is currently on display in the Samuel H. Kress Collection at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=nga&gt;{{cite web| title=National Gallery of Art| publisher=National Gallery of Art| url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.41637.html| accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6673">'''Computational musicology''' is defined as the study of [[music]] with computational modelling and simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Coutinho, Gimenes, Martins and Miranda (2005): "Computational Musicology: An Artificial Life Approach", &lt;http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/publications/computationalmusicology.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It saw its beginning in the 1950s and originally did not use computers, but more of statistical and [[mathematical]] methods. Nowadays computational musicology depends mostly on complex [[algorithms]] to either go through vast amounts of information or produce music using given parameters. Several  alternative names and subdisciplines of the field include mathematical music theory, computer music, systematic musicology, music information retrieval, computational musicology, digital musicology, sound and music computing and music informatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meredith|first1=David|title=Computational Music Analysis|date=2016|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-3319259291|page=v|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Lejaren Hiller]] acted as one of the foremost pioneers by creating one of the first musical compositions with a computer in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Lejaren Hiller Wikipedia article, [[Lejaren Hiller]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s research continued using statistical and mathematical methods, and started to use computers in an increasing manner as their capabilities grew. 1970s and 1980s were especially significant times for computational musicology as many discoveries were made. Since then the field has suffered a general lack of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Laine, Pauli (2005): "Tietokoneavusteisen musiikintutkimuksen menetelmistä" (in Finnish)&lt;http://www.musiikkilehti.fi/1-2005/2.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Most of the work in computational musicology is done with computers that run specifically designed programs. Commonly they employ the theory and methods statistical science, mathematics and music theory. Comprehension of the physics of hearing and sound are also required in analysis of raw audio data.

== Applications ==

=== Music databases ===
One of the earliest applications in computational musicology was the creation and use of musical [[databases]]. Input, usage and analysis of large amounts of data can be very troublesome using manual methods while usage of computers can make such tasks considerably easier.

=== Analysis of music ===
Different computer programs have been developed to analyze musical data. Data formats vary from standard notation to raw audio. Analysis of formats that are based on storing all properties of each note, for example [[MIDI]], were used originally and are still among the most common methods. Significant advances in analysis of raw audio data have been made only recently.

=== Artificial production of music ===
Different algorithms can be used to both [[algorithmic composition|create complete compositions]] and [[machine improvisation|improvise music]]. One of the methods by which a program can learn [[improvisation]] is analysis of choices a human player makes while improvising. [[Artificial neural networks]] are used extensively in such applications.

=== Historical change and music ===
One developing sociomusicological theory in computational musicology is the "Discursive Hypothesis" proposed by Kristoffer Jensen and [[David G. Hebert]], which suggests that "because both music and language are cultural discourses (which may reflect social reality in similarly limited ways), a relationship may be identifiable between the trajectories of significant features of musical sound and linguistic discourse regarding social data."&lt;ref&gt;McCollum, Jonathan and Hebert, David (2014) [https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Historical-Ethnomusicology-Jonathan-McCollum/dp/0739168266 ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology''] Lanham, MD: Lexington Books / Rowman &amp; Littlefield {{ISBN|0739168266}}; p.62. Some of Jensen and Hebert’s pioneering findings from 2013 on tendencies in US [[Billboard Hot 100]] songs have since been replicated and expanded upon by other scholars (e.g. Mauch M, MacCallum RM,Levy M, Leroi AM. 2015 The evolution of popular music: USA 1960–2010. R. Soc. Open sci. 2: 150081. https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.150081).&lt;/ref&gt; According to this perspective, analyses of "[[big data]]" may improve our understandings of how particular features of music and society are interrelated and change similarly across time, as significant correlations are increasingly identified within the musico-linguistic spectrum of human auditory communication.&lt;ref&gt;Kristoffer Jensen and David G. Hebert (2016). Evaluation and Prediction of Harmonic Complexity Across 76 Years of Billboard 100 Hits. In  R. Kronland-Martinet, M. Aramaki, and S. Ystad, (Eds.), [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-46282-0_18 ''Music, Mind, and Embodiment'']. Switzerland: Springer Press, pp.283-296. {{ISBN|978-3-319-46281-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-western music ===
Strategies from computational musicology are recently being applied for analysis of music in various parts of the world. For example, professors affiliated with the [[Birla Institute of Technology]] in India have produced studies of harmonic and melodic tendencies (in the [[raga]] structure) of [[Hindustani classical music]].&lt;ref&gt;Chakraborty, S., Mazzola, G., Tewari, S., Patra, M. (2014) [https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319114712 "Computational Musicology in Hindustani Music"] New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

[[RISM|RISM's]] [http://www.rism.info/ (Répertoire International des Sources Musicales)] database is one of the world's largest music databases, containing over 700,000 references to musical manuscripts. Anyone can use its search engine to find compositions.&lt;ref&gt;RISM database, &lt;http://www.rism.info/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre for History and Analysis of Recorded Music (CHARM) has developed the [[Mazurka Project]],&lt;ref&gt;Mazurka Project, &lt;http://mazurka.org.uk/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which offers "downloadable recordings . . . analytical software and training materials, and a variety of resources relating to the history of recording."

      <comment>The name of the author of the third translation was the wrong way round ("Rocco, Sinisgalli") - in the other names the surname comes first. "Rocco" is a common Italian first name, and "Sinisgalli" cannot be anything but a surname, so I've changed this to "Sinisgalli, Rocco".~~~~</comment>

'''''De pictura''''' (English: "On Painting") is a treatise written by the Italian architect and art theorist [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. The first version, written in vernacular Italian in 1435 under the title '''''Della pittura''''', was for a general audience. The Latin version, the ''De pictura'' of 1439–41, was more technical and intended for scholars.&lt;ref name="StAndrews"&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J. J. |last2=Robertson |first2=E.

==Context==

Alberti was a member of [[history of Florence|Florentine]] family exiled in the 14th century, who was able to return in Florence only from 1434, in the following of the Papal court during the [[Council of Florence]]. Here he knew contemporary art innovators such as  [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and [[Masaccio]], with whom he shared an interest for [[Renaissance humanism]] and classical art. Alberti was the first post-classical writer to produce a work of [[art theory]], as opposed to works about the function of religious art or art techniques, and reflected the developing [[Italian Renaissance art]] of his day.

===Approach===
{{further information|Mathematics and art}}

''De pictura'' aimed to describe systematically the figurative arts through "geometry". Alberti divided painting into three parts:
*''Circumscriptio'' (Italian: ''disegno''), consisting in drawing the bodies' contour
*'' Compositio'' (''commensuratio'' in the Italian version of the treatise), including tracing the lines joining the bodies
* ''Receptio luminum'' (''color''), taking into consideration colors and light.

The treatise contained an analysis of all the techniques and painting theories known at the time, in this surpassing medieval works such as ''The book of Art'' by [[Cennino Cennini]] (1390). ''De pictura'' also includes the first description of linear geometric perspective around 1416; Alberti credited the discovery to [[Brunelleschi]], and dedicated the 1435 edition to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edgerton|first1=Samuel Y.|title=Brunelleschi's mirror, Alberti's window, and Galileo's 'perspective tube'|journal=História, Ciências, Saúde-Manguinhos|date=October 2006|volume=13|issue=suppl. 0|doi=10.1590/S0104-59702006000500010|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0104-59702006000500010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt, Anthony]], ''Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450-1660'', (1985) [1940] [[OUP]], {{ISBN|0-19-881050-4}}, pages 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, Paul, [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9MoshlkHpFYJ:www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/uploads/docs/s1_23.pdf+Paul+Barlow+Professor&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjcjev4zZWsyXRk2Qb0TAbQHs52uwq7cmMmRBnlY97ah2aGpKYtVsGu-QOIeMciCrUfH45N1knB0NFikusclJybCwP5TMoAMaQJNS8TPzZFOBvOQvtUrmEPUT--Kqw8tmhvKr8G&amp;sig=AHIEtbSRK7DWVGwdLbYF38jvUAihfTFS0Q "The Death of History Painting in Nineteenth-Century Art?"

''De pictura'' relied heavily on references to art in classical literature; in fact [[Giotto]]'s huge ''[[Navicella (mosaic)|Navicella]]'' in mosaic at [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome (now effectively lost) was the only{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} modern (post-classical) work described in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Svetlana Alpers |author=Alpers, Svetlana Leontief |title=Ekphrasis and Aesthetic Attitudes in Vasari's Lives |journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |volume=23 |issue=3/4 |date=July 1960 |pages=190–192 |jstor=750591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
 [[File:Leonardo Da Vinci - Annunciazione.jpeg|thumb|350px|The accurate perspective in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s paintings such as his ''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' (1475–1480) derives from Alberti's ''De pictura''.]]

''De pictura'' influenced the work of artists including [[Donatello]], [[Ghiberti]], [[Botticelli]], and [[Ghirlandaio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lefaivre, Liane  |title=Leon Battista Alberti's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili: Re-Cognizing the Architectural Body in the Early Italian Renaissance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ocUH6f3l_E8C&amp;pg=PA135 |year=2005 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-62195-3 |pages=135–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] was the most influential of his recommendations, having a powerful effect on [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and through him on the whole Italian renaissance.&lt;ref name=Ackerman&gt;{{cite book |last=Ackerman |first=James S. |title=Distance Points: Essays in Theory and Renaissance Art and Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7EadYT-LTUC&amp;pg=PA87 |year=1994 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51077-6 |pages=86–87 |quote=No particular precept in the first part of De pictura had as pervasive an impact as the following section on perspective construction; the specific recommendations on color and shadow were ineffectual.. But the incalculable change that Leonardo wrought was directly dependent on Alberti's vision of art as a branch .. of optics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti made at least 29 uses of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', deriving his key themes of simplicity and seriousness directly from Pliny. For example, Alberti advised artists to use colour with restraint, and to paint in the effect of gold rather than using actual gold in their paintings. Gold did indeed vanish from Italian paintings of the second part of the 15th century. Artists however found their own ways to paint with restraint, rather than following Alberti's actual instructions directly. Similarly, he encouraged artists to add black when modelling shapes, rather than only adding white as [[Cennino Cennini]] had advised in his c.&amp;nbsp;1390 ''Il Libro dell'Arte''. This advice had the effect of making Italian renaissance paintings more sombre. Alberti was here perhaps following Pliny's description of the dark varnish used by Apelles.&lt;ref name=Ackerman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grafton |first1=Anthony |last2=Most |first2=Glenn W. |last3=Settis |first3=Salvatore |title=The Classical Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbqF8z2bq3sC&amp;pg=PA214 |year=2010 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03572-0|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial issues==
According to Hans Bader, its opponents consider it an oppressive [[ideology]] and reeducation tactic that actually reduces the ability of organizations to attain their goals. It has been suggested that diversity training reinforces differences between individuals instead of fostering their commonalities, thus helping to further racialize the workplace, creating situations where people "tiptoe" around issues such as how to relate to people of different cultures as opposed to people learning to [[communicate]] with and truly understand each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bader | first = Hans | url = https://cei.org/blog/diversity-training-backfires | title = Diversity training backfires | publisher = [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] | website = cei.org| date = 26 December 2007 | access-date = 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs which established specific responsibility for diversity, such as [[equal opportunity]] staff positions or diversity task forces, have proven most effective in general. However, the results also indicate that [[White people|White]] females benefit significantly more from diversity training. The benefits for [[African American]] females and males were appreciably lower than European American females. [[Social network|Networking]] and [[mentor]]ing, which were considered bias mitigating approaches, served [[African Americans|African American]] females the most. African American males were the least likely to benefit from any of the methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalev | first1 = Alexandra | last2 = Dobbin | first2 = Frank | last3 = Kelly | first3 = Erin | title = Best practices or best guesses?

They argue that attempting to see both sides of a controversial issue builds empathy and allows working environments to function better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = Sue | last2 = Brzuzy | first2 = Stephanie | last3 = Gerdes | first3 = Karen | last4 = Hurdle | first4 = Donna | title = Using structured controversy to teach diversity content and cultural competence | journal = Journal of Teaching in Social Work | volume = 23 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 55&amp;ndash;71 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | date = 2003 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandra Kalev conducted a comprehensive review of cultural diversity training conducted in 830 midsize to large U.S. workplaces over a thirty one year period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/19/AR2008011901899.html|title=Most Diversity Training Ineffective, Study Finds|last=Vedantam|first=Shankar|date=2008-01-20|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The results showed that diversity training was followed by a 7.5 percent drop in the number of women in management. The percentage of black men in top positions fell by 12 percent. Black, female managers fell by 10 percent. Similar effects were shown for Latinos and Asians. The study did not find that all diversity training is ineffective. Mandatory training programs offered to protect against discrimination lawsuits were called into question. Voluntary diversity training participation to advance organization’s business goals was associated with increased diversity at the management level.

'''Dump digging''' is the practice of locating and excavating old garbage dumps with the intent of discovering objects which have potential value as collectibles or antiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dumps are a window into history |quote=Campbell and the others call themselves "dumpdiggers," shoveling for signs of the past – pottery, bottles, buttons, cutlery, moustache cups – wherever people once tossed garbage. |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These dumps are sometimes centuries old but often date to the late 19th century or early part of the 20th century. Among other things, the practice of dump digging is directly linked to antique bottle collecting and glassmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/bottle/glassmaking.htm#|title= Historic Glass Bottle Identification &amp; Information Website| accessdate=2011-07-15 |work=Glassmaking &amp; Glassmakers }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

It is a form of [[historical digging]] which involves long hours working with a shovel, pick and other hand tools.  Finding evidence of potential antique bottle dumps or middens is done by searching areas where it is likely that older garbage was deposited.  Diggers generally look for clues of pre1920s junk piles in the woods or down embankments, places where old houses or businesses stand or once stood.  Hiking along waterways and swampy areas, particularly during droughts, can also produce important clues and lead to good discoveries.  

Additionally, many coastal cities are surrounded by landfills or “tips”, places where enormous quantities of trash were deposited in the past intended to create additional acres of viable real estate.  It can take many months of searching each of these locations for a decent dig to be surface.

==Background and controversies==
Dump digging for potentially valuable collectibles is at least as old as the Pharaohs. For practical reasons dump diggers often use a much less forensic style than academic archeologists or museum curators would on their projects. Not unlike the privies, cisterns and wells that other historical diggers explore and salvage in, dumps are typically fleeting sources. They are often located on properties which are in the process of being permanently altered by major development and other factors.

==Items found and locations==
[[File:1870 tobacco pipe, EastEndDumpDiggers.jpg|thumb|250px|A clay pipe discovered while excavating an old bottle dump (ca. 1870).]]
Dump digging can yield different items and artifacts in each location. A town dump can be somewhat different than a farm dump or a railroad dump but in each case there could be industrial age pottery, [[stoneware]], china, tobacco pipes, military relics like bayonets and gun barrels, musket balls, uniform buttons and other buttons, marbles and an assortment of other things.  A high percentage of these dump discoveries are routinely found in severe states of decay, damaged or broken altogether.  In many cases even the things which have stood the test of time remarkably well have little if any monetary value.  There are many exceptions to this general rule that keep dump diggers busy searching and occasionally they are surprised by what they unearth working their sites.          

Through the common process known as tipping, vast amounts of refuse generated by towns and cities were dumped into harbors, along marshy shorelines and other areas while forming viable real estate cheaply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= B.|last= Miller |title=Fat of the Land: Garbage in New York: The Last Two Hundred Years |place=New York |publisher= Four Walls Eight Windows |year=2000|isbn= 1-56858-172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Excavating in these areas is also a form of dump digging.  Elusive and often deep, small portions of these ashy [[landfill]] dumps are sometimes rediscovered during major development projects.  Enormous quantities of a given locations everyday trash were deposited into these often difficult to reach locales.  

The bulk of this garbage has never been investigated and at present much of it is still undiscovered.  Through researching and active searching occasionally the opportunity arises to dig into small portions and find old bottles and other objects which survive remarkably well as curiosities, collectibles or antiques. For centuries active waterways were also frequently converted into major dumping spots for household and industrial refuse but they are generally impossible to reach without expensive equipment.  Along with the existing information generated from the efforts of dump diggers and others, a wealth of additional information is waiting among these widely distributed landfills and other dumping spots.

'''Dynamic range compression''' ('''DRC''') or simply '''compression'''  is an [[audio signal processing]] operation that reduces the volume of loud [[sound]]s or amplifies quiet sounds thus reducing or ''compressing'' an [[audio signal]]'s [[dynamic range]]. Compression is commonly used in [[sound recording and reproduction]], [[broadcasting]],&lt;ref name="Follansbee"&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Follansbee |first1= Joe |title= Hands-on Guide to Streaming Media: An Introduction to Delivering On-Demand Media |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gEN1GbEgb5AC |year=2006 |publisher= Focal Press |page=84|isbn= 9780240808635}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sound reinforcement system|live sound reinforcement]] and in some [[instrument amplifier]]s.

A dedicated electronic hardware unit or audio software that applies compression is called a '''compressor'''. In the 2000s, compressors became available as software plugins that run in [[digital audio workstation]] software. In recorded and live music, compression parameters may be adjusted to change the way they affect sounds. Compression and limiting are identical in process but different in degree and perceived effect. A [[limiter]] is a compressor with a high [[#Ratio|ratio]] and, generally, a short [[#Attack and release|attack time]].

''Downward compression'' reduces loud sounds over a certain threshold while quiet sounds remain unaffected. A [[limiter]] is an extreme type of downward compression. ''Upward compression'' increases the loudness of sounds below a certain threshold while leaving louder sounds unaffected. Both downward and upward compression reduce the [[Dynamic_range#Audio|dynamic range]] of an audio signal.&lt;ref name="Reese"&gt;{{Cite book   | last1 = Reese | first1 = David | last2 = Gross | first2 = Lynne| last3 = Gross | first3 = Brian | title = Audio Production Worktext: Concepts, Techniques, and Equipment   | publisher = Focal Press | year =  2009  | pages = 149 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NH1Q0BI2YPcC  | isbn = 0-240-81098-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:Compressors Feed Design.gif|frame|A feed-forward compressor design (left) and feedback design (right)]]

The signal entering a compressor is split; one copy is sent to a [[variable-gain amplifier]] and the other to a ''side-chain'' where the signal level is measured and a circuit controlled by the measured signal level applies the required gain to the amplifier. This design, known as a ''feed-forward'' type, is used today in most compressors. Earlier designs were based on a ''feedback'' layout where the signal level was measured after the amplifier.

There are a number of technologies used for variable-gain amplification, each having different advantages and disadvantages. [[Vacuum tube]]s are used in a configuration called ''variable-mu'' where the grid-to-cathode voltage changes to alter the gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.tangible-technology.com/dynamics/comp_lim_ec_dh_pw2.html |title=Gain Control Devices, Side Chains, Audio Amplifiers |access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optical compressors use a [[photoresistor]] and a small lamp ([[Incandescent light bulb|Incandescent]], [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] or [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescent panel]])&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.uaudio.com/_works/pdf/manuals/LA-2A_manual.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113094825/http://www.uaudio.com/_works/pdf/manuals/LA-2A_manual.pdf |archive-date=2006-11-13 |title=Model LA-2A Leveling Amplifier}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create changes in signal gain. Other technologies used include [[field effect transistor]]s and a [[diode bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.uaudio.com/webzine/2006/april/index4.html |title=Analog Obsession: Compression Technology and Topology |publisher=Universal Audio |access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When working with digital audio, [[digital signal processing]] techniques are commonly used to implement compression as [[audio plug-in]]s, in [[mixing console]]s, and in [[digital audio workstation]]s. Often the algorithms used emulate the above analog technologies.

== Controls and features ==
[[File:Compression ratio.svg|thumb|right|220px|Different compression ratios for a signal level above the theshold]]
A number of user-adjustable control parameters and features are used to adjust dynamic range compression signal processing algorithms and components.

=== Threshold ===
A compressor reduces the level of an audio signal if its amplitude exceeds a certain ''threshold''. Threshold is commonly set in [[decibels]] dB, where a lower threshold (e.g. -60&amp;nbsp;dB) means a larger portion of the signal is treated. When the signal level is below the threshold, no processing is performed and the input signal is passed, unmodified, to the output. Thus a higher threshold of, e.g., −5&amp;nbsp;dB, results in less processing, less compression.

Threshold timing behavior is subject to attack and release settings (see [[#Attack and release|below]]). When the signal level goes above threshold, compressor operation is delayed by the ''attack'' setting. For an amount of time determined by the ''release'' after the input signal has fallen below the threshold, the compressor continues to apply dynamic range compression.

=== Ratio ===
The amount of gain reduction is determined by '''ratio''': a ratio of 4:1 means that if input level is 4&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] over the threshold, the output signal level is reduced to 1&amp;nbsp;dB over the threshold. The gain and output level has been reduced by 3&amp;nbsp;dB.

The highest ratio of ∞:1 is often known as ''limiting''. It is commonly achieved using a ratio of 60:1, and effectively denotes that any signal above the threshold is brought down to the threshold level once the ''attack'' time has expired.

=== Attack and release ===
[[File:Audio Compression Attack and Release-2.svg|thumb|220px|The attack and release phases in a compressor]]
A compressor may provide a degree of control over how quickly it acts. The ''attack'' is the period when the compressor is decreasing gain in response to increased level at the input to reach the gain determined by the ratio. The ''release'' is the period when the compressor is increasing gain in response to reduced level at the input to reach the output gain determined by the ratio, or, to unity, once the input level has fallen below the threshold. Because the loudness pattern of the source material is modified by the time-varying operation of compressor, it may change the character of the signal in subtle to quite noticeable ways depending on the attack and release settings used.

The length of each period is determined by the rate of change and the required change in gain. For more intuitive operation, a compressor's attack and release controls are labeled as a unit of time (often milliseconds). This is the amount of time it takes for the gain to change a set amount of dB or a set percentage towards the target gain. There is no industry standard for the exact meaning of these time parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rane.com/pdf/ranenotes/Dynamics_Processors.pdf |publisher=[[Rane Corporation]] |date=September 2005 |author1=Rick Jeffs |author2=Scott Holden |author3=Dennis Bohn |title=RaneNote 155: Dynamics Processors – Technology &amp; Applications |quote=There is no industry standard and different manufacturers define [release time] differently. |page=6-7 |accessdate=2012-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many compressors the attack and release times are adjustable by the user. Some compressors, however, have the attack and release times determined by the circuit design and these cannot be adjusted by the user. Sometimes the attack and release times are ''automatic'' or ''program dependent'', meaning that the behavior may change dependent on the input signal.

=== Soft and hard knees ===
[[File:Compression knee.svg|thumb|220px|right|Hard Knee and Soft Knee compression]]
Another control a compressor might offer is hard knee or soft knee selection.  This controls whether the bend in the response curve between below threshold and above threshold is abrupt (hard) or gradual (soft). A soft knee slowly increases the compression ratio as the level increases and eventually reaches the compression ratio set by the user. A soft knee reduces the potentially audible transition from uncompressed to compressed, and is especially applicable for higher ratio settings where the changeover at the threshold would be more noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec00/articles/adcompression.htm |publisher=Sound On Sound |date=December 2000 |author=Paul White |title=Advanced Compression Techniques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peak vs RMS sensing ===
A peak-sensing compressor responds to the peak level of the input signal. While providing tighter peak level control, peak level sensing does not necessarily relate to human perception of loudness. Some compressors apply an power measurement function (commonly [[root mean square]] or RMS) on the input signal before comparing its level to the threshold. This produces a more relaxed compression that more closely relates to human perception of loudness.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

=== Stereo linking ===

A compressor in stereo linking mode applies the same amount of gain reduction to both the left and right channels. This is done to prevent image shifting that can occur if each channel is compressed individually. It becomes noticeable when a loud element that is panned to either edge of the stereo field raises the level of the program to the compressor's threshold, causing its image to shift toward the center of the stereo field.

Stereo linking can be achieved in two ways: Either the compressor sums to mono the left and right channel at the input, then only the left channel controls are functional; or, the compressor still calculates the required amount of gain reduction independently for each channel and then applies the highest amount of gain reduction to both (in such case it could still make sense to dial different settings on left and right channels as one might wish to have less compression for left-side events&lt;ref&gt;UAD Powered Plug-Ins, User Manual, Version 4.10, Fairchild 670 section, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Makeup gain ===

Because the compressor is reducing the gain (or level) of the signal, the ability to add a fixed amount of ''make-up gain'' at the output is usually provided so that an optimum level can be used.

=== Look-ahead ===
The look-ahead function is designed to overcome the problem of being forced to compromise between slow attack rates that produce smooth-sounding gain changes, and fast attack rates capable of catching transients. Look-ahead is a misnomer in that the future is not actually observed. Instead, the input signal is split, and one side is delayed. The non-delayed signal is used to drive the compression of the delayed signal, which then appears at the output. This way a smooth-sounding slower attack rate can be used to catch transients. The cost of this solution is that the signal is delayed.

== Uses ==

=== Public spaces ===
Compression is often used to make music sound louder without increasing its peak amplitude.  By compressing the peak (or loudest) signals, it becomes possible to increase the overall gain (or volume) of a signal without exceeding the dynamic limits of a reproduction device or medium. The net effect, when compression is applied along with a gain boost, is that relatively quiet sounds become louder, while louder sounds remain unchanged.

Compression is often applied in this manner in audio systems for restaurants, retail, and similar public environments that play background music at a relatively low volume and need it compressed, not just to keep the volume fairly constant, but also to make quiet parts of the music audible over ambient noise.

Compression can increase average output gain of a [[Amplifier|power amplifier]] by 50 to 100% with a reduced dynamic range. For paging and evacuation systems, this adds clarity under noisy circumstances and saves on the number of amplifiers required.

=== Music production ===
Compression is often used in music production to make performances more consistent in dynamic range so that they "sit" in the mix of other instruments better and maintain consistent attention from the listener. Vocal performances in [[rock and roll|rock music]] or [[pop music]] are usually compressed to make them stand out from the surrounding instruments and add clarity.

Compression can also be used on instrument sounds to create effects not primarily focused on boosting [[loudness]]. For instance, drum and cymbal sounds tend to decay quickly, but a compressor can make the sound appear to have a more sustained tail.  Guitar sounds are often compressed to produce a fuller, more sustained sound.

Most devices capable of compressing audio dynamics can also be used to reduce the volume of one audio source when another audio source reaches a certain level; this is called [[side-chaining]].

In [[electronic dance music]], side-chaining is often used on [[bassline]]s, controlled by the kick drum or a similar percussive trigger, to prevent the two conflicting, and provide a pulsating, rhythmic dynamic to the sound.

=== Voice ===
A compressor can be used to reduce [[Sibilant consonant|sibilance]] ('ess' sounds) in vocals by feeding the compressor with an [[Equalization (audio)|EQ]] set to the relevant frequencies, so that only those frequencies activate the compressor.  If unchecked, sibilance could cause distortion even if sound levels are not very high.  This usage is called [[de-essing]].

Compression is used in voice communications in [[amateur radio]] that employ [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB modulation]].  Often it is used to make a particular station's signal more readable to a distant station, or to make one's station's transmitted signal stand out against others.  This occurs especially in [[pileup (disambiguation)|pileup]]s where amateur radio stations are competing for the opportunity to talk to a [[DX communication|DX]] station. Since an SSB signal's [[amplitude]] depends on the level of [[modulation]], the net result is that the average amplitude of the signal, and hence average transmitted power is stronger than it would be without compression.&lt;ref&gt;"HF Radio Systems &amp; Circuits", Sabin &amp;  Schoenike, editors. Noble, 1998, pp. 13–25, 271–290&lt;/ref&gt;  Most modern amateur radio SSB transceivers have speech compressors built in.

Compression is also used in [[Two-way radio|land mobile radio]], especially in transmit audio of professional [[walkie-talkie]]s and in [[Tone remote|remote control dispatch consoles]].

=== Broadcasting ===
Compression is used extensively in [[broadcasting]] to boost the perceived volume of sound while reducing the dynamic range of source audio (typically CDs) to a range that can be accommodated by the narrower-range broadcast signal. Broadcasters in most countries have legal limits on instantaneous peak volume they may broadcast. Normally these limits are met by permanently inserted hardware in the on-air chain (see [[#Multiband compression|multiband compression]] above).

As was alluded to above, the use of compressors to boost perceived volume is a favorite trick of broadcasters who want their station to sound "louder" at the same volume than comparable stations on the dial. The effect is to make the more heavily compressed station "jump out" at the listener at a given volume setting.

But loudness jumps are not limited to inter-channel differences; they also exist between programme material within the same channel. Loudness differences are a frequent source of audience complaints, especially TV commercials and promos that seem too loud. Complicating this is that many broadcasters use (quasi-)peak meters and peak-levelling. Unfortunately the peak level reading does not correlate well with the perceived loudness. It basically should only be used to prevent overmodulation.

The European Broadcasting Union has been addressing this issue in the EBU PLOUD Group, which consist of over 240 audio professionals, many from broadcasters and equipment manufacturers. In 2010, the EBU published EBU Recommendation R 128, which introduces a new way of metering and normalising audio. The Recommendation is based on [[ITU-R BS.1770]]. Several European TV stations have already announced to support the new norm and over 20 manufacturers have announced products supporting the new 'EBU Mode' Loudness meters.&lt;ref name="EBU3341"&gt;[http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3341.pdf EBU Tech 3341]&lt;/ref&gt;

To help audio engineers understand what Loudness Range their material consists of (e.g. to check if some compression may be needed to fit it into the channel of a specific delivery platform), the EBU also introduced the Loudness Range Descriptor.&lt;ref name="EBU3342"&gt;[http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3342.pdf EBU Tech 3342]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cd loudness trend-something.gif|right|thumb|305px|The trend of increasing loudness as shown by waveform images of the same song mastered on CD four times since 1983.]]
Record companies, mixing engineers and mastering engineers have been gradually increasing the overall volume of commercial albums. The greater [[loudness]] is achieved by using higher degrees of compression and limiting during [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and [[Audio mastering|mastering]]; compression algorithms have been engineered specifically to accomplish the task of maximizing audio level in the digital stream. Hard limiting or [[clipping (audio)|clipping]] can result, affecting the tone and timbre of the music. The effort to increase loudness has been referred to as the [[loudness war]].

Most television commercials are heavily compressed (typically to a dynamic range of no more than 3&amp;nbsp;dB) to achieve near-maximum perceived loudness while staying within permissible limits. This causes a problem that TV viewers often notice: when a station switches from minimally compressed program material to a heavily compressed commercial, the volume sometimes seems to increase dramatically. Peak loudness might be the same—meeting the letter of the law—but high compression puts much more of the audio in the commercial at close to the maximum allowable, making the commercial seem much louder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/bargains-and-rip-offs/ask-an-expert/article.html?in_article_id=484363&amp;in_page_id=513 Are these noisy TV adverts legal?, This is Money, 9 May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/page-8114 TV ads sound too loud and rules should change, says regulator. Out-law.com, June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other uses ===
Some applications use a compressor to reduce the dynamic range of a signal for transmission, expanding it afterward. This reduces the effects of a channel with limited dynamic range.  See ''[[Companding]]''.

[[Bass amplifier]]s and [[keyboard amplifier]]s often include compression circuitry to prevent sudden high-wattage peaks that could damage the speakers. [[Electric bass]] players often use compression effects, either [[effects unit]]s available in pedal, [[rackmount]] units, or built-in devices in bass amps, to even out the sound levels of their [[bassline]]s.

[[Gain pumping]], where a regular amplitude peak (such as a kick drum) causes the rest of the mix to change in volume due to the compressor, is generally avoided in music production. However, many [[Electronic dance music|dance]] and hip-hop musicians purposefully use this phenomenon, causing the mix to alter in volume rhythmically in time with the beat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewhippinpost.co.uk/mixing-music/compression-audio-mixing.htm |title=Compression in Audio Music Mixing |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hearing aid]]s use a compressor to bring the audio volume into the listener's hearing range. To help the patient perceive the direction sound comes from, some hearing aids use [[binaural recording|binaural]] compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Textbook of Hearing Aid Amplification |author=Robert E. Sandlin |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=2000 |isbn=9781565939974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compressors are also used for [[Hearing protectors|hearing protection]] in some electronic "active sound protection" [[earmuffs]] and [[earplugs]], to let sounds at ordinary volumes be heard normally while attenuating louder sounds, possibly also amplifying softer sounds. This allows, for example, shooters wearing hearing protection at a shooting range to converse normally, while sharply attenuating the much louder sounds of the gunshots, and similarly for musicians to hear quiet music but be protected from loud noises such as drums or cymbal crashes.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Limiting ==
[[File:Clipping compared to limiting.svg|thumb|220px|Limiting and clipping compared. Note that clipping introduces a large amount of distortion whereas limiting only introduces a small amount while keeping the signal within the threshold.]]
{{Main|Limiter}}
Compression and limiting are identical in process but different in degree and perceived effect. A [[limiter]] is a compressor with a high ratio and, generally, a fast attack time. Compression with ratio of 10:1 or more is generally considered limiting.&lt;ref name="tcelectronic.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcelectronic.com/media/droney_massey_2001_compres.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231072136/http://www.tcelectronic.com/media/droney_massey_2001_compres.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-31 |publisher=[[TC Electronic]] |author1=Maureen Droney |author2=Howard Massey |title=Compression Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brick wall limiting'' has a very high ratio and a very fast attack time. Ideally, this ensures that an audio signal never exceeds the amplitude of the threshold. Ratios of 20:1  all the way up to ∞:1 are considered 'brick wall'.&lt;ref name="tcelectronic.com"/&gt;  The sonic results of more than momentary and infrequent hard/brick-wall limiting are harsh and unpleasant, thus it is more common as a safety device in live sound and broadcast applications.

Some [[bass amp]]s and [[PA system]] amplifiers include limiters to prevent sudden volume peaks from causing distortion and/or damaging the speakers. Some modern consumer electronics devices incorporate limiters. [[Sony]] uses the [[automatic volume limiter system]] (AVLS), on some audio products and the [[PlayStation Portable]].

== Side-chaining ==

[[File:Compressor Sidechain.svg|thumb|300px|The sidechain of a feed-forward compressor]]
{{listen | filename = Uplifting Trance Sidechain.ogg| title = Uplifting Trance Sidechain| description = The first 8 bars are without side-chaining applied, the second 8 are with side-chaining. | format = [[Ogg]]}}

A compressor with a side-chain input controls gain from main input to output based on the level of the signal at the side-chain input.&lt;ref name="Colletti"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonicscoop.com/2013/06/27/beyond-the-basics-sidechain-compression/ |title=Beyond The Basics: Sidechain Compression |author=Justin Colletti |date=June 27, 2013 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compressor behaves in the conventional manner when both inputs are supplied with the same signal. The side-chain input is used by [[disc jockey]]s for [[ducking]] – lowering the music volume automatically when speaking. The DJ's microphone signal is routed to the side-chain input so that whenever the DJ speaks the compressor reduces the volume of the music. A sidechain with [[equalization (audio)|equalization]] controls can be used to reduce the volume of signals that have a strong spectral content within a certain frequency range: it can act as a [[de-esser]], reducing the level of vocal [[sibilance]] in the range of 6–9&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Techniques For Vocal De-essing |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may09/articles/deessing.htm |author=Mike Senior |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A de-esser helps reduce high frequencies that tend to overdrive [[preemphasis|preemphasized]] media (such as phonograph records and FM radio). Another use of the side-chain in music production serves to maintain a loud bass track without the [[bass drum]] causing undue peaks that result in loss of overall [[Headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]].&lt;ref name="Colletti"/&gt;

==Parallel compression==

One technique is to insert the compressor in a parallel signal path. This is known as [[parallel compression]], a form of upward compression that facilitates dynamic control without significant audible side effects, if the ratio is relatively low and the compressor's sound is relatively neutral. On the other hand, a high compression ratio with significant audible artifacts can be chosen in one of the two parallel signal paths—this is used by some concert mixers and recording engineers as an artistic effect called ''New York compression'' or ''Motown compression''. Combining a linear signal with a compressor and then reducing the output gain of the compression chain results in low-level detail enhancement without any peak reduction (since the compressor significantly adds to the combined gain at low levels only). This is often beneficial when  compressing transient content, since it maintains high-level dynamic liveliness, despite reducing the overall dynamic range.

== {{visible anchor|Multiband compression}} == &lt;!-- [[Multiband compression]] redirects here --&gt;

Multiband compressors can act differently on different frequency bands. The advantage of multiband compression over full-bandwidth compression is that unneeded audible gain changes or "pumping" in other frequency bands is not caused by changing signal levels in a single frequency band.

Multiband compressors work by first splitting the signal through some number of [[band-pass filters]] or [[audio crossover|crossover filters]]. The frequency ranges or crossover frequencies may be adjustable. Each split signal then passes through its own compressor and is independently adjustable for threshold, ratio, attack, and release. The signals are then recombined and an additional limiting circuit may be employed to ensure that the combined effects do not create unwanted peak levels.

Software plug-ins or [[digital signal processing|DSP]] emulations of multiband compressors can be complex, with many bands, and require corresponding computing power.

Multiband compressors are primarily an [[audio mastering]] tool, but their inclusion in [[digital audio workstation]] plug-in sets is increasing their use among mix engineers. On-air signal chains of [[radio station]]s commonly use hardware multiband compressors to increase apparent [[loudness]] without fear of [[overmodulation]]. Having a louder sound is often considered an advantage in commercial competition. However, adjusting a radio station's multiband output compressor requires some artistic sense of style, plenty of time, and good ears. This is because the constantly changing [[spectral balance]] between audio bands may have an equalizing effect on the output, by dynamically modifying the on-air frequency response. A further development of this approach is programmable radio output processing, where the parameters of the multiband compressor automatically change between different settings according to the current programme block style or the time of day.

==Serial compression==
Serial compression is a [[wikt:technique|technique]] used in [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] and [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]].  Serial compression is achieved by using two fairly different compressors in a signal chain.  One compressor generally stabilizes the [[dynamic range]] while the other aggressively compresses stronger peaks.  This is the normal internal signal routing in common combination devices marketed as ''compressor-limiters'', where an RMS compressor (for general gain control) is followed by a fast peak sensing limiter (for overload protection). Done properly, even heavy serial compression can sound natural in a way not possible with a single compressor.  It is most often used to even out erratic [[vocal]]s and [[guitar]]s.

== Software audio players ==

Some [[audio player (software)|software audio players]] support [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]] that implement compression.  These can increase perceived volume of audio tracks, or even out the volume of highly-variable music (such as [[classical music]], or a playlist that spans multiple music types). This improves listenability of audio played through poor-quality speakers, or when played in noisy environments (such as in a car or during a party).  Such software may also be used in [[micro-broadcasting]] or home-based audio mastering.

== Objective influence on the signal ==

In an article released in January 2014 by the ''Journal of the Audio Engineering Society'',&lt;ref name="DerutyTardieuAES"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Emmanuel Deruty |author2=Damien Tardieu | publisher  = Journal of the Audio Engineering Society |date=January 2014 | url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=17085 |title=About Dynamic Processing in Mainstream Music |accessdate=2014-06-06|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emmanuel Deruty and Damien Tardieu performed a systematic study describing the influence of compressors and brickwall limiters on the musical audio signal. The experiment involved four software limiters: Waves L2,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author= Waves|title= L2 Ultramaximizer | url = http://www.waves.com/Content.aspx?id=211  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonnox Oxford Limiter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Sonnox |title= Oxford Limiter | url = http://www.sonnoxplugins.com/pub/plugins/products/limiter.htm  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Mundt’s Loudmax,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Thomas Mundt |title= Loudmax | url = http://loudmax.blogspot.com/  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue Cat’s Protector,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Blue Cat Audio |title= Protector | url = http://www.bluecataudio.com/Products/Product_Protector/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as four software compressors: Waves H-Comp,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Waves |title= H-Comp Hybrid Compressor | url = http://www.waves.com/Content.aspx?id=9111  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonnox Oxford Dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Sonnox |title= Oxford Dynamics | url = http://www.sonnoxplugins.com/pub/plugins/products/dynamics.htm  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonalksis SV-3157,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Sonalksis |title=SV-315  Compressor |url=http://www.sonalksis.com/sv315.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112144954/http://www.sonalksis.com/sv315.htm |archivedate=2014-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and URS 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Unique Recording Software|title=URS 1970 Classic Console Compressor Limiter|url=http://www.ursplugins.com/urs1970.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916012015/http://www.ursplugins.com/urs1970.html|archivedate=2014-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study provides objective data on what limiters and compressors do to the audio signal.

Five signal descriptors were considered: [[RMS power]], EBU3341/R128 integrated loudness,&lt;ref name="EBU3341" /&gt; [[crest factor]], EBU3342 LRA,&lt;ref name="EBU3342" /&gt; and density of clipped samples. RMS power accounts for the signal's physical level, EBU3341 loudness for the perceived level.&lt;ref name="EBU3341" /&gt; The crest factor, which is the difference between the signal's peak and its average power,&lt;ref name="DerutyTardieuAES" /&gt; is on occasions considered as a basis for the measure of micro-dynamics, for instance in the ''TT Dynamic Range Meter'' plug-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfxmachine.com/docs/loudnesswar/loudness_war.pdf |title=The Loudness War: Background, Speculation and Recommendations |author=Earl Vickers |publisher=[[Audio Engineering Society]] |work=AES 2010: Paper Sessions: Loudness and Dynamics |location=San Francisco |date=November 4, 2010 |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Dynamic Range Meter | url = http://www.pleasurizemusic.com/free-downloads  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, EBU3342 LRA has been repeatedly considered as a measure of macro-dynamics or dynamics in the musical sense.&lt;ref name="DerutyTardieuAES" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SOS_Dynamic_Range"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Deruty | first = Emmanuel | title = 'Dynamic Range' &amp; The Loudness War | work = Sound on Sound | accessdate = 2013-10-24 | date = September 2011 | url = http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep11/articles/loudness.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=26 July 2012 |title=Measuring the Evolution of Contemporary Western Popular Music |trans_title= |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=2 |series= |issue= |page= 521|at= |chapter= |location= |publisher= |language= |arxiv=1205.5651 |id= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= 22837813|pmc= 3405292|bibcode=2012NatSR...2E.521S |doi=10.1038/srep00521 |accessdate=26 July 2012 |url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/120726/srep00521/full/srep00521.html |laysource= |laysummary= |laydate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=  | last1 = Serrà | first1 = J | last2 = Corral | first2 = A | last3 = Boguñá | first3 = M | last4 = Haro | first4 = M | last5 = Arcos | first5 = JL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Jens Hjortkjær |author2=Mads Walther-Hansen | publisher  = Journal of the Audio Engineering Society |date=January 2014 |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=17085/ |title=Perceptual Effects of Dynamic Range Compression in Popular Music Recordings |accessdate=2014-06-06|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author  = Esben Skovenborg | publisher  = AES 132nd Convention |date=April 2012 |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=16254/ |title=Loudness Range (LRA) – Design and Evaluation |accessdate=2014-10-25|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limiters ===

The tested limiters had the following influence on the signal:
* increase of RMS power,
* increase of EBU3341 loudness,
* decrease of crest factor,
* decrease of EBU3342 LRA, but only for high amounts of limiting,
* increase of clipped sample density.

In other words, limiters increase both physical and perceptual levels, increase the density of clipped samples, decrease the crest factor and decrease macro-dynamics (LRA) given that the amount of limiting is substantial.

=== Compressors ===

As far as the compressors are concerned, the authors performed two processing sessions, using a fast attack (0.5 ms) in one case, and a slow attack (50 ms) in the other. Gain make-up is deactivated, but the resulting file is normalized.

Set with a fast attack, the tested compressors had the following influence on the signal:
* slight increase of RMS power,
* slight increase of EBU3341 loudness,
* decrease of crest factor,
* decrease of EBU3342 LRA,
* slight decrease of clipped sample density.

In other words, fast-attack compressors increase both physical and perceptual levels, but only slightly. They decrease the density of clipped samples, and decrease both crest factor and macro-dynamics.

Set with a slow attack, the tested compressors had the following influence on the signal:
* decrease of RMS power,
* decrease of EBU3341 loudness,
* no influence on crest factor,
* decrease of EBU3342 LRA,
* no influence on clipped sample density.

In other words, slow-attack compressors decrease both physical and perceptual levels, decrease macro-dynamics, but have no influence on crest factor and clipped sample density.

'''Engineer reconnaissance''' is the [[reconnaissance]] operations performed by [[combat engineers]] to enable forward movement of own troops, in war usually over territory previously occupied by the enemy. The activity includes provision of reconnaissance instructions on the intended route for which a commander needs an [[engineer reconnaissance report]], identification of [[road symbols|road]] and [[bridge symbols]], posting of safe transit notices for identified [[Standard Bridge Capacity|bridge capacities]], estimation for time and materials required to effect [[route repair]], and performance of [[demolition reconnaissance]] to identify intended enemy demolitions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6092">The '''Essex Court Chambers-Singapore Academy of Law''' Moot is an [[moot court|international moot competition]] for young practicing lawyers organised by [[Essex Court Chambers]] and [[Singapore Academy of Law]]. Whereas most moot competitions are only for students still in [[law school]] or who have not been [[bar (law)|called to the bar]], the ECC-SAL Moot is only open to lawyers who have been qualified for practice for no more than three years. The first edition of the moot was held in 2012. The moot is open to lawyers from Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Singapore, and South Korea, and is mainly judged by lawyers (including [[Queen's Counsel]] and [[Senior Counsel]]), academics, and judges in the region. It typically involves a commercial dispute between parties before the [[Singapore International Commercial Court]]. The top eight teams that qualify from the preliminary phase (two rounds) proceed to the knockout stages.

These were developed by the [[European Committee for Standardization|European Committee for Standardisation]] upon the request of the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name="EN1990"&gt;EN 1990:2002 E, Eurocode - Basis of Structural Design, CEN, November 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the eurocodes is to provide:&lt;ref name="EN1990"/&gt;
* a means to prove compliance with the requirements for mechanical strength and stability and safety in case of fire established by European Union law.&lt;ref name="89-106-EEC"&gt;European Council Directive 89/106/EEC&lt;/ref&gt;
* a basis for construction and engineering contract specifications.
* a framework for creating harmonized technical specifications for building products ([[CE mark]]).

By March 2010 the Eurocodes are mandatory for the specification of European public works and are intended to become the de facto standard for the private sector.  The Eurocodes therefore replace the existing national [[building code]]s  published by national standard bodies (e.g. [[BS 5950]]), although many countries had a period of co-existence. Additionally, each country is expected to issue a National Annex to the Eurocodes which will need referencing for a particular country (e.g. The UK National Annex). At present take up of Eurocodes is slow on private sector projects and existing national codes are still widely used by engineers.

==History==
In 1975, the [[European Commission|Commission of the European Community]] (presently the European Commission), decided on an action programme in the field of construction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was to eliminate technical obstacles to trade and the harmonisation of technical specifications. Within this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harmonised technical
rules for the design of construction works which, in a first would serve as an alternative to the national rules in force in the [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) and, ultimately, would replace them. For fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a steering committee with representatives of the member states, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of European codes in the 1980s.

In 1989, the Commission and the member states of the EU and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) decided, on the basis of an agreement between the Commission and to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) through a series of mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN). This links de facto the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council's Directives and/or Commission's Decisions dealing with European standards (e.g. the Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC on construction products - CPD and Council Directives 93/37/EEC, 921S0lEEC and 89/440lEEC on public works and services and equiva1ent EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal market).

The eurocodes are published as a separate ''European Standards'', each having a number of parts. By 2002, ten sections have been 
developed and published:

Each of the codes (except EN 1990) is divided into a number of Parts covering specific aspects of the subject. In total there are 58 EN Eurocode parts distributed in the ten Eurocodes (EN 1990 – 1999).

All of the EN Eurocodes relating to materials have a Part 1-1 which covers the design of buildings and other civil engineering structures and a Part 1-2 for fire design. The codes for concrete, steel, composite steel and concrete, and timber structures and earthquake resistance have a Part 2 covering design of bridges. These Parts 2 should be used in combination with the appropriate general Parts (Parts 1).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few species which have secondarily lost the ability to reproduce sexually, such as [[Bdelloidea]], and some plants and animals that routinely reproduce asexually (by [[apomixis]] and [[parthenogenesis]]) without entirely losing sex. The evolution of [[sex]] contains two related, yet distinct, themes: its ''origin'' and its ''maintenance''.

The maintenance of sexual reproduction in a highly competitive world had long been one of the major mysteries of biology given that [[asexual reproduction]] can reproduce by budding, fission, or spore formation not involving union of gametes, which reproduce at [[#xspeed|a much faster rate]] compared to sexual reproduction. 50% of offspring from sexual reproduction are males, unable to produce offspring themselves.

Since hypotheses for the origins of sex are difficult to test experimentally (outside of [[evolutionary computation]]), most current work has focused on the maintenance of sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction must offer significant [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] advantages to a species because despite the two-fold cost of sex, it dominates among multicellular forms of life, implying that the fitness of offspring produced outweighs the costs. Sexual reproduction derives from [[genetic recombination|recombination]], where parent genotypes are reorganized and shared with the offspring. This stands in contrast to single-parent asexual [[Self-replication|replication]], where the offspring is identical to the parents. Recombination supplies two [[fault-tolerance]] mechanisms at the molecular level: ''recombinational [[DNA repair]]'' (promoted during [[meiosis]] because [[homologous chromosome]]s pair at that time) and [[Complementation (genetics)|''complementation'']] (also known as [[heterosis]], hybrid vigor or masking of mutations).

==Historical perspective==

The issue features in the writings of [[Aristotle]], and modern philosophical-scientific thinking on the problem dates from at least [[Erasmus Darwin]] (1731-1802) in the 18th century.  [[August Weismann]] picked up the thread in 1889, arguing that sex served to generate [[genetic variation]], as detailed in the majority of the explanations below. On the other hand, [[Charles Darwin]] (1809-1882) concluded that the effects of hybrid vigor (complementation) "is amply sufficient to account for the ... genesis of the two sexes".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} This is consistent with the repair and complementation hypothesis, described below. Biologists - including [[W. D. Hamilton]], [[Alexey Kondrashov]], [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], Harris Bernstein, Carol Bernstein, Michael M. Cox, Frederic A. Hopf and Richard E. Michod - have suggested several explanations for how a vast array of different living species maintain sexual reproduction.

==Disadvantages of sex and sexual reproduction==

This section will briefly focus on the ostensible disadvantages of sexual reproduction as compared to relative advantages in asexual reproduction. Given that sexual reproduction abounds in multicellular organisms, this section is followed by a lengthy overview of theories aiming to elucidate the advantages of sex and sexual reproduction.

==={{anchor|Two-fold cost}}{{anchor|xspeed}}Population expansion cost of sex===

An asexual population can grow much more rapidly with each generation. Assume the entire population of some theoretical species has 100 total organisms consisting of two sexes (i.e. males and females) with 50:50 male-to-female representation, and only the females of this species can bear offspring. If all capable members of this population procreated once, a total of 50 offspring would be produced (the ''F1'' generation). Contrast this outcome with an asexual species, where each member of the 100-organism population is capable of bearing young. If all capable members of this asexual population procreated once, a total of 100 offspring would be produced.

[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|250px|This diagram illustrates the ''two-fold cost of sex''. If each individual were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the sexual population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation.]]

This idea is sometimes referred to as the '''two-fold cost''' of sexual reproduction. It was first described mathematically by [[John Maynard Smith]].&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;[[John Maynard Smith]] ''The Evolution of Sex'' 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In his manuscript Smith further speculated on the impact of an asexual mutant arising in a sexual population, which suppresses meiosis and allows eggs to develop by mitotic division into offspring genetically identical to the mother.&lt;ref name="1946- 2005"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56964580|title=Evolution : an introduction|last=1946-|first=Stearns, S. C. (Stephen C.),|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Hoekstra, Rolf F.|isbn=0199255636|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford [England]|oclc=56964580}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mutant-asexual lineage would double its representation in the population each generation, all else being equal.

Technically the problem above is not that of sexual reproduction but a problem of having a subset of organisms incapable of bearing offspring. Indeed some multicellular organisms ([[isogamy|isogamous]]) engage in sexual reproduction but all members of the species are capable of bearing offspring.&lt;ref name="Hoekstra"&gt;[[Rolf Hoekstra]] 1987 ''The Evolution of Sex and its Consequences'' 1988 Birkhauser.&lt;/ref&gt; The two-fold reproductive disadvantage assumes that males contribute only genes to their offspring and sexual females waste half their reproductive potential on sons.&lt;ref name="1946- 2005"/&gt; Thus, in this formulation, the principal costs of sex is that males and females must successfully [[copulation (zoology)|copulate]] (which almost always involves expending energy to come together through time and space).

=== Selfish cytoplasmic genes ===
Sexual reproduction implies that chromosomes and alleles segregate and recombine in every generation, but not all genes transmitted together to the offspring.&lt;ref name="1946- 2005"/&gt; The chances of spreading mutants that cause unfair transmission at the expense of their non-mutant colleagues, these mutations are referred to as selfish because they promote their own spread at the cost of alternative alleles or host organism, these include; nuclear meiotic drivers and selfish cytoplasmic genes.&lt;ref name="1946- 2005"/&gt; Meiotic driver is defined as genes that distort meiosis to produce gametes containing themselves more than half the time and selfish cytoplasmic gene is a gene located in an organelle, plasmid, or intracellular parasite that modifies reproduction to cause its own increase at the expense of the cell or organism that carries it&lt;ref name="1946- 2005"/&gt;

===Genetic heritability cost of sex===

A sexually reproducing organism only passes on ~50% of its own genetic material to each L2 offspring. This is a consequence of the fact that gametes from sexually reproducing species are [[haploid]]. Again however, this is not applicable to all sexual organisms. There are numerous species which are sexual but do not have a genetic-loss problem because they do not produce males or females. Yeast, for example, are [[isogamy|isogamous]] sexual organisms which have two mating types which fuse and recombine their haploid genomes. Both sexes reproduce during the haploid and diploid stages of their life cycle and have a 100% chance of passing their genes into their offspring.&lt;ref name="Hoekstra" /&gt;

Some species avoid the cost of 50% of sexual reproduction, although they have "sex" (in the sense of [[genetic recombination]]). In these species (e.g., [[bacteria]], [[ciliates]], [[dinoflagellate]]s and [[diatom]]s), "sex" and reproduction occurs separately.&lt;ref name="Ridley M 2004 p. 314"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Oxford University Press, p. 5-6 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d4cLBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Online resources, [http://www.oup.co.uk/companion/beukeboom].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of sex and sexual reproduction==

The concept of sex includes two fundamental phenomena: the sexual process (fusion of genetic information of two individuals) and sexual differentiation (separation of this information into two parts). Depending on the presence or absence of these phenomena, the existing ways of reproduction can be divided into asexual, hermaphrodite and dioecious forms. The sexual process and sexual differentiation are different phenomena, and, in essence, are diametrically opposed. The first creates (increases) diversity of genotypes, and the second decreases it by half.
 
Reproductive advantages of the asexual forms are in quantity of the progeny and the advantages of the hermaphrodite forms – in maximum diversity. Transition from the hermaphrodite to dioecious state leads to a loss of at least half of the diversity. So, the main question is to explain the advantages given by sexual differentiation, i.e. the benefits of two separate sexes compared to hermaphrodites rather than to explain benefits of sexual forms (hermaphrodite + dioecious) over asexual ones. It has already been understood that since sexual reproduction is not associated with any clear reproductive advantages, as compared with asexual, there should be some important advantages in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Crow J.F. (1994). Advantages of Sexual Reproduction, Dev. Gen., vol.15, pp. 205-213.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages due to genetic variation===

For the advantage due to genetic variation, there are three possible reasons this might happen. First, sexual reproduction can combine the effects of two beneficial [[mutation]]s in the same individual (i.e. sex aids in the spread of advantageous traits). Also, the necessary mutations do not have to have occurred one after another in a single line of descendants.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2012}} Second, sex acts to bring together currently deleterious mutations to create severely unfit individuals that are then eliminated from the population (i.e. sex aids in the removal of deleterious genes). However, in organisms containing only one set of chromosomes, deleterious mutations would be eliminated immediately, and therefore removal of harmful mutations is an unlikely benefit for sexual reproduction. Lastly, sex creates new gene combinations that may be more fit than previously existing ones, or may simply lead to reduced competition among relatives.

For the advantage due to DNA repair, there is an immediate large benefit of removing DNA damage by recombinational [[DNA repair]] during [[meiosis]], since this removal allows greater survival of progeny with undamaged DNA. The advantage of [[Complementation (genetics)|complementation]] to each sexual partner is avoidance of the bad effects of their deleterious recessive genes in progeny by the masking effect of normal dominant genes contributed by the other partner.

The classes of hypotheses based on the creation of variation are further broken down below. Any number of these hypotheses may be true in any given species (they are not [[mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]]), and different hypotheses may apply in different species. However, a research framework based on creation of variation has yet to be found that allows one to determine whether the reason for sex is universal for all sexual species, and, if not, which mechanisms are acting in each species.

On the other hand, the maintenance of sex based on DNA repair and complementation applies widely to all sexual species.

===Protection from major genetic mutation===

In contrast to the view that sex promotes genetic variation, Heng,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heng HH | year = 2007 | title = Elimination of altered karyotypes by sexual reproduction preserves species identity | url = | journal = Genome | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 517–524 | pmid = 17612621 | doi=10.1139/g07-039 | first2 = Henry H.Q.| last2 = Heng }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gorelick and Heng&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gorelick R, Heng HH | year = 2011 | title = Sex reduces genetic variation: a multidisciplinary review | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 1088–1098 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01173.x | pmid = 21091466 | last2 = Heng }}&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed evidence that sex actually acts as a constraint on genetic variation. They consider that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve.

===Novel genotypes===
[[File:Evolsex-dia2a.svg|thumb|250px|This diagram illustrates how sex might create novel genotypes more rapidly. Two advantageous alleles ''A'' and ''B'' occur at random. The two alleles are recombined rapidly in a sexual population (top), but in an asexual population (bottom) the two alleles must independently arise because of [[clonal interference]].]]

Sex could be a method by which novel genotypes are created. Because sex combines genes from two individuals, sexually reproducing populations can more easily combine advantageous genes than can asexual populations. If, in a sexual population, two different advantageous [[alleles]] arise at different loci on a chromosome in different members of the population, a chromosome containing the two advantageous alleles can be produced within a few generations by [[Genetic recombination|recombination]]. However, should the same two alleles arise in different members of an asexual population, the only way that one chromosome can develop the other allele is to independently gain the same mutation, which would take much longer. Several studies have addressed counterarguments, and the question of whether this model is sufficiently robust to explain the predominance of sexual versus asexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="Birdsell"/&gt;{{rp|73–86}}

[[Ronald Fisher]] also suggested that sex might facilitate the spread of advantageous genes by allowing them to better escape their genetic surroundings, if they should arise on a chromosome with deleterious genes.

Supporters of these theories respond to the balance argument that the individuals produced by sexual and asexual reproduction may differ in other respects too – which may influence the persistence of sexuality. For example, in the [[Asexual reproduction#Alternation between sexual and asexual reproduction|heterogamous]] [[water flea]]s of the genus ''Cladocera'', sexual offspring form eggs which are better able to survive the winter versus those the fleas produce asexually.

===Increased resistance to parasites===
One of the most widely discussed theories to explain the persistence of sex is that it is maintained to assist sexual individuals in resisting [[parasite]]s, also known as the [[Red Queen Hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="ridley"&gt;[[Matt Ridley]] 1995 ''The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature'' 1995 Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Birdsell&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Birdsell | first1 = JA | last2 = Wills | first2 = C | year = 2003 | title = The evolutionary origin and maintenance of sexual recombination: A review of contemporary models | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4757-5190-1_2 | journal = Evolutionary Biology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 27–137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113–117}}&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, Ross J.; Clegg, Michael, T (Eds.), Springer.

When an environment changes, previously neutral or deleterious alleles can become favourable. If the environment changed sufficiently rapidly (i.e. between generations), these changes in the environment can make sex advantageous for the individual. Such rapid changes in environment are caused by the co-evolution between hosts and parasites.

Imagine, for example that there is one gene in parasites with two alleles ''p'' and ''P'' conferring two types of parasitic ability, and one gene in hosts with two alleles ''h'' and ''H'', conferring two types of parasite resistance, such that parasites with allele ''p'' can attach themselves to hosts with the allele ''h'', and ''P'' to ''H''. Such a situation will lead to cyclic changes in allele frequency - as ''p'' increases in frequency, ''h'' will be disfavoured.

In reality, there will be several genes involved in the relationship between hosts and parasites. In an asexual population of hosts, offspring will only have the different parasitic resistance if a mutation arises. In a sexual population of hosts, however, offspring will have a new combination of parasitic resistance alleles.

In other words, like [[Lewis Carroll]]'s Red Queen, sexual hosts are continually "running" (adapting) to "stay in one place" (resist parasites).

Evidence for this explanation for the evolution of sex is provided by comparison of the rate of molecular evolution of genes for [[kinase]]s and [[immunoglobulin]]s in the [[immune system]] with genes coding other [[protein]]s. The genes coding for immune system proteins evolve considerably faster.&lt;ref name="kuma"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuma | first1 = K. | last2 = Iwabe | first2 = N. | last3 = Miyata | first3 = T. | year = 1995 | title = Functional constraints against variations on molecules from the tissue-level - slowly evolving brain-specific genes demonstrated by protein-kinase and immunoglobulin supergene families | url = | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 123–130 | pmid = 7877487 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wolfe"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wolfe KH, Sharp PM | year = 1993 | title = Mammalian gene evolution - nucleotide-sequence divergence between mouse and rat | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 441–456 | doi = 10.1007/BF00178874 | pmid = 8308912 | last2 = Sharp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence for the Red Queen hypothesis was provided by observing long‐term dynamics and parasite coevolution in a "mixed" (sexual and asexual) population of snails (''[[Potamopyrgus antipodarum]]''). The number of sexuals, the number asexuals, and the rates of parasite infection for both were monitored. It was found that clones that were plentiful at the beginning of the study became more susceptible to parasites over time. As parasite infections increased, the once plentiful clones dwindled dramatically in number. Some clonal types disappeared entirely. Meanwhile, sexual snail populations remained much more stable over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/599080 | last1 = Jokela | first1 = Jukka | last2 = Dybdahl | first2 = Mark | last3 = Lively | first3 = Curtis | year = 2009 | title = The Maintenance of Sex, Clonal Dynamics, and Host-Parasite Coevolution in a Mixed Population of Sexual and Asexual Snails | jstor = 10.1086/599080| journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 174 | issue = s1 | pages = S43 | pmid=19441961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090706171542.htm | title = Parasites May Have Had Role In Evolution Of Sex | date = 31 July 2009 | publisher = Science Daily | accessdate= 19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to expectation based on the [[Red Queen hypothesis]], they found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites in sexual geckos was significantly higher than in asexuals sharing the same habitat.

In 2011, researchers used the microscopic roundworm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' as a host and the pathogenic bacteria ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'' to generate a host-parasite coevolutionary system in a controlled environment, allowing them to conduct more than 70 evolution experiments testing the Red Queen Hypothesis. They genetically manipulated the [[mating system]] of ''C. elegans'', causing populations to mate either sexually, by self-fertilization, or a mixture of both within the same population. Then they exposed those populations to the ''S. marcescens'' parasite. It was found that the self-fertilizing populations of ''C. elegans'' were rapidly driven extinct by the coevolving parasites while sex allowed populations to keep pace with their parasites, a result consistent with the Red Queen Hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1206360 | last1 = Morran | first1 = Levi T. | last2 = Schmidt | first2 = Olivia G. | last3 = Gelarden | first3 = Ian A. | last4 = Parrish Rc | first4 = Raymond C. | last5 = Lively | first5 = Curtis M. | year = 2011 | title = Running with the Red Queen: Host-Parasite Coevolution Selects for Biparental Sex | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6039/216 | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6039 | pages = 216–218 | pmid = 21737739 | pmc = 3402160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110707141158.htm | title = Sex -- As We Know It -- Works Thanks to Ever-Evolving Host-Parasite Relationships, Biologists Find | date = 9 July 2011 | publisher = Science Daily | accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In natural populations of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', self-fertilization is the predominant mode of reproduction, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of about 1%.&lt;ref name="pmid16005289"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barrière A, Félix MA |title=High local genetic diversity and low outcrossing rate in Caenorhabditis elegans natural populations |journal=Curr.

Critics of the Red Queen hypothesis question whether the constantly changing environment of hosts and parasites is sufficiently common to explain the evolution of sex. In particular, Otto and Nuismer &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Otto SP, Nuismer SL | year = 2004 | title = Species interactions and the evolution of sex | url = |journal=Science |volume=304 |issue=5673 |pages = 1018–1020 | pmid = 15143283 | doi=10.1126/science.1094072| last2 = Nuismer }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented results showing that species interactions (e.g. host vs parasite interactions) typically select against sex. They concluded that, although the Red Queen hypothesis favors sex under certain circumstances, it alone does not account for the ubiquity of sex. Otto and Gerstein &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16856849 | doi=10.1042/BST0340519 |volume=34 |issue=Pt 4 |title=Why have sex?

==DNA repair and complementation==
As discussed in the earlier part of this article, sexual reproduction is conventionally explained as an adaptation for producing genetic variation through allelic recombination. As acknowledged above, however, serious problems with this explanation have led many biologists to conclude that the benefit of sex is a major unsolved problem in evolutionary biology.

An alternative "[[information theory|informational]]" approach to this problem has led to the view that the two fundamental aspects of sex, [[genetic recombination]] and [[outcrossing]], are adaptive responses to the two major sources of "noise" in transmitting genetic information. Genetic noise can occur as either physical damage to the genome (e.g. chemically altered bases of DNA or breaks in the chromosome) or replication errors (mutations)&lt;ref name="dna-repair"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bernstein H |author2=Byerly HC |author3=Hopf FA |author4=Michod RE |title=Origin of sex |journal=J.

The repair and complementation hypothesis assumes that [[genetic recombination]] is fundamentally a DNA repair process, and that when it occurs during [[meiosis]] it is an adaptation for repairing the genomic DNA which is passed on to progeny. Recombinational repair is the only repair process known which can accurately remove double-strand damages in DNA, and such damages are both common in nature and ordinarily lethal if not repaired. For instance, double-strand breaks in DNA occur about 50 times per cell cycle in human cells [see [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)]]]. Recombinational repair is prevalent from the simplest viruses to the most complex multicellular eukaryotes. It is effective against many different types of genomic damage, and in particular is highly efficient at overcoming double-strand damages. Studies of the mechanism of meiotic recombination indicate that meiosis is an adaptation for repairing DNA.&lt;ref name="replication-help"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cox MM |title=Historical overview: searching for replication help in all of the rec places |journal=Proc.

In some lines of descent from the earliest organisms, the [[Ploidy|diploid]] stage of the sexual cycle, which was at first transient, became the predominant stage, because it allowed [[Complementation (genetics)|complementation]] — the masking of deleterious recessive mutations (i.e. [[Heterosis|hybrid vigor or heterosis]]). [[Outcrossing]], the second fundamental aspect of sex, is maintained by the advantage of masking mutations and the disadvantage of [[inbreeding]] (mating with a close relative) which allows expression of recessive mutations (commonly observed as [[inbreeding depression]]). This is in accord with [[Charles Darwin]],&lt;ref&gt;Darwin CR (1876). The effects of cross and self fertilisation in the vegetable kingdom. London: John Murray. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/published/1881_Worms_F1357/1876_CrossandSelfFertilisation_F1249/1876_CrossandSelfFertilisation_F1249.html] see page 462&lt;/ref&gt; who concluded that the adaptive advantage of sex is hybrid vigor; or as he put it, "the offspring of two individuals, especially if their progenitors have been subjected to very different conditions, have a great advantage in height, weight, constitutional vigor and fertility over the self fertilised offspring from either one of the same parents."

However, outcrossing may be abandoned in favor of parthenogenesis or selfing (which retain the advantage of meiotic recombinational repair) under conditions in which the costs of mating are very high. For instance, costs of mating are high when individuals are rare in a geographic area, such as when there has been a forest fire and the individuals entering the burned area are the initial ones to arrive. At such times mates are hard to find, and this favors parthenogenic species.

In the view of the repair and complementation hypothesis, the removal of DNA damage by recombinational repair produces a new, less deleterious form of informational noise, allelic recombination, as a by-product. This lesser informational noise generates genetic variation, viewed by some as the major effect of sex, as discussed in the earlier parts of this article.

==Deleterious mutation clearance==
[[Mutation]]s can have many different effects upon an organism. It is generally believed that the majority of non-neutral mutations are deleterious, which means that they will cause a decrease in the organism's overall fitness.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;Griffiths ''et al.'' 1999. Gene mutations, p197-234, ''in'' Modern Genetic Analysis, New York, W.H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; If a mutation has a deleterious effect, it will then usually be removed from the population by the process of [[natural selection]]. Sexual reproduction is believed to be more efficient than asexual reproduction in removing those mutations from the genome.&lt;ref name="kondrashov"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/336435a0 | last1 = Kondrashov | first1 = A. S. | authorlink = Alexey Kondrashov | year = 1988| title = Deleterious mutations and the evolution of sexual reproduction | url = | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 336 | issue = 6198| pages = 435–440 | pmid=3057385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main hypotheses which explain how sex may act to remove deleterious [[gene]]s from the genome.

===Evading harmful mutation build-up===
{{Main|Muller's ratchet}}
While DNA is able to recombine to modify alleles, DNA is also susceptible to mutations within the sequence that can affect an organism in a negative manner. Asexual organisms do not have the ability to recombine their genetic information to form new and differing alleles. Once a mutation occurs in the DNA or other genetic carrying sequence, there is no way for the mutation to be removed from the population until another mutation occurs that ultimately deletes the primary mutation. This is rare among organisms. Hermann Joseph Muller introduced the idea that mutations build up in asexual reproducing organisms. Muller described this occurrence by comparing the mutations that accumulate as a ratchet. Each mutation that arises in asexually reproducing organisms turns the ratchet once. The ratchet is unable to be rotated backwards, only forwards. The next mutation that occurs turns the ratchet once more. Additional mutations in a population continually turn the ratchet and the mutations, mostly deleterious, continually accumulate without recombination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muller | first1 = H.J. | year = 1964 | title = The Relation of Recombination to Mutational Advance | url = | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 2–9 | doi=10.1016/0027-5107(64)90047-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mutations are passed onto the next generation because the offspring are exact genetic clones of their parent. The genetic load of organisms and their populations will increase due to the addition of multiple deleterious mutations and decrease the overall reproductive success and fitness.

For sexually reproducing populations, studies have shown that single-celled bottlenecks are beneficial for resisting mutation build-up. Passaging a population through a single-celled bottleneck involves the fertilization event occurring with haploid sets of DNA, forming one fertilized cell. For example, humans undergo a single-celled bottleneck in that the haploid sperm fertilizes the haploid egg, forming the diploid zygote, which is unicellular. This passage through a single cell is beneficial in that it lowers the chance of mutations from being passed on through multiple individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niklas|first=Karl J.|date=2014-01-01|title=The evolutionary-developmental origins of multicellularity|url=http://www.amjbot.org/content/101/1/6|journal=American Journal of Botany|language=en|volume=101|issue=1|pages=6–25|doi=10.3732/ajb.1300314|issn=0002-9122|pmid=24363320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies using ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'' suggest that this unicellular initial stage is important for resisting mutations due to the importance of high relatedness. Highly related individuals are more closely related, and more clonal, whereas less related individuals are less so, increasing the likelihood that an individual in a population of low relatedness may have a detrimental mutation. Highly related populations also tend to thrive better than lowly related because the cost of sacrificing an individual is greatly offset by the benefit gained by its relatives and in turn, its genes, according to [[kin selection]]. The studies with ''D. discoideum'' showed that conditions of high relatedness resisted mutant individuals more effectively than those of low relatedness, suggesting the importance of high relatedness to resist mutations from proliferating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuzdzal-Fick|first=Jennie J.|last2=Fox|first2=Sara A.|last3=Strassmann|first3=Joan E.|last4=Queller|first4=David C.|date=2011-12-16|title=High Relatedness Is Necessary and Sufficient to Maintain Multicellularity in Dictyostelium|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6062/1548|journal=Science|language=en|volume=334|issue=6062|pages=1548–1551|doi=10.1126/science.1213272|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22174251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal of deleterious genes===
[[File:Synergistic versus antagonistic epistasis.svg|thumb|200px|Diagram illustrating different relationships between numbers of mutations and fitness. Kondrashov's model requires ''synergistic epistasis'', which is represented by the red line&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) ''Evolution'', 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth B, Charlesworth D (2010) ''Elements of Evolutionary Genetics''. Roberts and Company Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; - each subsequent mutation has a disproportionately large effect on the organism's fitness.]]

This hypothesis was proposed by [[Alexey Kondrashov]], and is sometimes known as the ''deterministic mutation hypothesis''.&lt;ref name="kondrashov"/&gt; It assumes that the majority of deleterious mutations are only slightly deleterious, and affect the individual such that the introduction of each additional mutation has an increasingly large effect on the fitness of the organism. This relationship between number of mutations and fitness is known as [[epistasis|''synergistic epistasis'']].

By way of [[analogy]], think of a [[Automobile|car]] with several minor faults. Each is not sufficient alone to prevent the car from running, but in combination, the faults combine to prevent the car from functioning.

Similarly, an organism may be able to cope with a few defects, but the presence of many mutations could overwhelm its backup mechanisms.

Kondrashov argues that the slightly deleterious nature of mutations means that the population will tend to be composed of individuals with a small number of mutations. Sex will act to [[Genetic recombination|recombine]] these genotypes, creating some individuals with fewer deleterious mutations, and some with more. Because there is a major selective disadvantage to individuals with more mutations, these individuals die out. In essence, sex compartmentalises the deleterious mutations.

There has been much criticism of Kondrashov's theory, since it relies on two key restrictive conditions. The first requires that the rate of deleterious mutation should exceed one per genome per generation in order to provide a substantial advantage for sex. While there is some empirical evidence for it (for example in [[Drosophila]]&lt;ref name="Drosophila"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitlock | first1 = M. C. | last2 = Bourguet | first2 = D. | year = 2000 | title = Factors affecting the genetic load in Drosophila: synergistic epistasis and correlations among fitness components | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 54 | issue = 5| pages = 1654–1660 | pmid = 11108592 | doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2000)054[1654:fatgli]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E. coli]]&lt;ref name="E. coli"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/37108 | last1 = Elena | first1 = S.

Thus, for instance, for the sexual species ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' (yeast) and ''Neurospora crassa'' (fungus), the mutation rate per genome per replication are 0.0027 and 0.0030 respectively. For the nematode worm ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', the mutation rate per effective genome per sexual generation is 0.036.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9560386 | volume=148 | issue=4 | title=Rates of spontaneous mutation | pmc=1460098 |date=April 1998 | pages=1667–86 |author1=Drake JW |author2=Charlesworth B |author3=Charlesworth D |author4=Crow JF | journal = Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, there should be strong interactions among loci (synergistic epistasis), a mutation-fitness relation for which there is only limited evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 28473589 | title=Negative selection in humans and fruit flies involves synergistic epistasis | journal = Science | doi=10.1126/science.aah5238 | volume=356 | pages=539–542 | last1 = Sohail | first1 = M | last2 = Vakhrusheva | first2 = OA | last3 = Sul | first3 = JH | last4 = Pulit | first4 = SL | last5 = Francioli | first5 = LC | last6 = van den Berg | first6 = LH | last7 = Veldink | first7 = JH | last8 = de Bakker | first8 = PIW | last9 = Bazykin | first9 = GA | last10 = Kondrashov | first10 = AS | last11 = Sunyaev | first11 = SR | year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, there is also the same amount of evidence that mutations show no epistasis (purely additive model) or antagonistic interactions (each additional mutation has a disproportionally ''small'' effect).

==Other explanations==

===Geodakyan's evolutionary theory of sex===
Geodakyan suggested that sexual dimorphism provides a partitioning of a species' phenotypes into at least two functional partitions: a female partition that secures beneficial features of the species and a male partition that emerged in species with more variable and unpredictable environments. The male partition is suggested to be an "experimental" part of the species that allows the species to expand their ecological niche, and to have alternative configurations. This theory underlines the higher variability and higher mortality in males, in comparison to females. This functional partitioning also explains the higher susceptibility to disease in males, in comparison to females and therefore includes the idea of "protection against parasites" as another functionality of male sex. Geodakyan's evolutionary theory of sex was developed in Russia in 1960-80 and was not known to the West till the era of the Internet. Trofimova, who analysed psychological sex differences, hypothesised that the male sex might also provide a "redundancy pruning" function.&lt;ref name=Trofimova&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova |first1=I.|year=2015| title= Do psychological sex differences reflect evolutionary bi-sexual partitioning? |journal =American Journal of Psychology|volume=128|issue=4 |pages=485–514|doi= 10.5406/amerjpsyc.128.4.0485| PMID=26721176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed of evolution===
Ilan Eshel suggested that sex prevents rapid evolution. He suggests that [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] breaks up favourable gene combinations more often than it creates them, and sex is maintained because it ensures selection is longer-term than in asexual populations - so the population is less affected by short-term changes.&lt;ref name=Birdsell /&gt;{{rp|85–86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 5527627 | volume=1 | issue=1 | title=On the evolutionary effect of recombination |date=May 1970 | pages=88–100 | author=Eshel I, Feldman MW | journal = Theoretical population biology | doi=10.1016/0040-5809(70)90043-2| last2=Feldman }}&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation is not widely accepted, as its assumptions are very restrictive.

It has recently been shown in experiments with ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'' algae that sex can remove the speed limit{{clarify|date=July 2013}} on evolution.&lt;ref name="speed"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colegrave | first1 = N. | year = 2002 | pmid = 12478292 | title = Sex releases the speed limit on evolution | doi = 10.1038/nature01191 | journal = Nature | volume = 420 | issue = 6916| pages = 664–666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An information theoretic analysis using a simplified but useful model shows that in asexual reproduction, the information gain per generation of a species is limited to 1 bit per generation, while in sexual reproduction, the information gain is bounded by &lt;math&gt;\surd G&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the genome in bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=David MacKay | title=Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms | publisher=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge |date=2003 | pages=269–280 | url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libertine bubble theory===
The evolution of sex can alternatively be described as a kind of gene exchange that is independent from reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lesbarrères D | year = 2011 | title = Sex or no sex, reproduction is not the question | url = | journal = BioEssays | volume = 33 | issue = 11| page = 818 | doi = 10.1002/bies.201100105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Thierry Lodé]]'s "libertine bubble theory", sex originated from an archaic gene transfer process among prebiotic bubbles.&lt;ref name=sexisnot&gt;{{cite journal | author = LODÉ T | year = 2011 | title = Sex is not a solution for reproduction: the libertine bubble theory | doi=10.1002/bies.201000125 | journal = BioEssays | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 419–422 | pmid = 21472739 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = LODÉ T | year = 2011 | title = The origin of sex was interaction, not reproduction (what's sex really all about), Big Idea | url = http://www.pagepress.org/journals/index.php/eb/article/view/eb.2012.e1 | journal = New Scientist | volume = 212 | issue = 2837| pages = 30–31 | doi = 10.1016/S0262-4079(11)62719-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contact among the pre-biotic bubbles could, through simple food or parasitic reactions, promote the transfer of genetic material from one bubble to another. That interactions between two organisms be in balance appear to be a sufficient condition to make these interactions evolutionarily efficient, i.e. to select bubbles that tolerate these interactions (“libertine” bubbles) through a blind evolutionary process of self-reinforcing gene correlations and compatibility.&lt;ref name="LODÉ T 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | author = LODÉ T | year = 2012 | title = Sex and the origin of genetic exchanges | url = | journal = Trends Evol Biol | volume = 4 | issue = | page = e1 | doi = 10.4081/eb.2012.e1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "libertine bubble theory" proposes that meiotic sex evolved in proto-eukaryotes to solve a problem that bacteria did not have, namely a large amount of DNA material, occurring in an archaic step of proto-cell formation and genetic exchanges. So that, rather than providing selective advantages through reproduction, sex could be thought of as a series of separate events which combines step-by-step some very weak benefits of recombination, meiosis, gametogenesis and syngamy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lodé | first1 = T | year = 2012 | title = Have sex or not ?

==Origin of sexual reproduction==
{{Life timeline}}
Many [[protist]]s reproduce sexually, as do the multicellular [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[fungi]]. In the eukaryotic fossil record, sexual reproduction first appeared by 1.2 billion years ago in the [[Proterozoic|Proterozoic Eon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://paleobiol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/3/386 Nicholas J. Butterfield, "Bangiomorpha pubescens n. gen., n. sp.: implications for the evolution of sex, multicellularity, and the Mesoproterozoic/Neoproterozoic radiation of eukaryotes"]&lt;/ref&gt; All sexually reproducing [[eukaryotic]] organisms likely derive from a single-celled common ancestor.&lt;ref name="Letunic I and Bork P"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernstein2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernstein2010&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bernstein H, Bernstein C | year = 2010 | title = Evolutionary origin of recombination during meiosis | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 60 | issue = 7| pages = 498–505 | doi = 10.1525/bio.2010.60.7.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sexisnot/&gt; It is probable that the evolution of sex was an integral part of the evolution of the first eukaryotic cell.&lt;ref name="Ploompuu1999"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ploompuu, T.|year=1999|title=Biosüsteemide mälu teooria|trans-title=Why the eukaryotic cell memory was needed|journal=Schola biotheoretica|language=Estonian|location=Tartu|publisher=Sulemees|volume=XXV|pages=51–56|ISBN=9985908155}} Abstract in English available online: [http://www.tlu.ee/~toenu/ingl/euk_rakk.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid29436502"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hörandl E, Speijer D |title=How oxygen gave rise to eukaryotic sex |journal=Proc.

===Diploidy===
Organisms need to replicate their genetic material in an efficient and reliable manner. The necessity to repair genetic damage is one of the leading theories explaining the origin of sexual reproduction. [[Diploid]] individuals can repair a damaged section of their DNA via [[homologous recombination]], since there are two copies of the gene in the cell and if one copy is [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|damaged]], the other copy is unlikely to be damaged at the same site.

A harmful mutation in a [[haploid]] individual, on the other hand, is more likely to become fixed (i.e. permanent), since any [[DNA repair]] mechanism would have no source to recover the original undamaged sequence from.&lt;ref name="dna-repair" /&gt; The most primitive form of sex may have been one organism with damaged DNA replicating an undamaged strand from a similar organism in order to repair itself.&lt;!--

===Meiosis===
If, as evidence indicates, sexual reproduction arose very early in eukaryotic evolution, the essential features of meiosis may have already been present in the prokaryotic ancestors of eukaryotes.&lt;ref name =Bernstein2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BernsteinIntech/&gt; In extant organisms, proteins with central functions in meiosis are similar to key proteins in [[transformation (genetics)|natural transformation]] in bacteria and DNA transfer in [[archaea]].&lt;ref name=BernsteinIntech&gt;Bernstein, H., Bernstein, C. Evolutionary origin and adaptive function of meiosis. In “Meiosis”, Intech Publ (Carol Bernstein and Harris Bernstein editors), Chapter 3: 41-75 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernsteinarchaea&gt;Bernstein H, Bernstein C. Sexual communication in archaea, the precursor to meiosis. pp. 103-117 in Biocommunication of Archaea (Guenther Witzany, ed.) 2017. Springer International Publishing {{ISBN|978-3-319-65535-2}}  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-65536-9&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[recA]] recombinase, that catalyses the key functions of DNA homology search and strand exchange in the bacterial sexual process of transformation, has orthologs in eukaryotes that perform similar functions in meiotic recombination&lt;ref name=BernsteinIntech /&gt; (see Wikipedia articles [[RecA]], [[RAD51]] and [[DMC1]]).

Natural transformation in bacteria, DNA transfer in archaea, and [[meiosis]] in eukaryotic microorganisms are induced by stressful circumstances such as overcrowding, resource depletion, and DNA damaging conditions.&lt;ref name="LODÉ T 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BernsteinIntech /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernsteinarchaea /&gt; This suggests that these sexual processes are adaptations for dealing with stress, particularly stress that causes DNA damage. In bacteria, these stresses induce an altered physiologic state, termed competence, that allows active take-up of DNA from a donor bacterium and the integration of this DNA into the recipient genome (see [[Natural competence]]) allowing recombinational repair of the recipients’ damaged DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michod RE, Wojciechowski MF, Hoelzer MA |year=1988 |title=DNA repair and the evolution of transformation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis |journal=Genetics |volume=118 |issue=1 |pages=31–39 |pmid=8608929 |pmc=1203263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If environmental stresses leading to DNA damage were a persistent challenge to the survival of early microorganisms, then selection would likely have been continuous through the prokaryote to eukaryote transition,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BernsteinIntech /&gt; and adaptative adjustments would have followed a course in which bacterial transformation or archaeal DNA transfer naturally gave rise to sexual reproduction in eukaryotes.

===Virus-like RNA-based origin===
Sex might also have been present even earlier, in the hypothesized [[RNA world]] that preceded DNA cellular life forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=6164094 |volume=244 |issue=4 |title=The origin of genetic information |date=April 1981 |pages=88–92, 96, et passim |vauthors=Eigen M, Gardiner W, Schuster P, Winkler-Oswatitsch R |journal=Scientific American |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0481-88}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed origin of sex in the RNA world was based on the type of sexual interaction that is known to occur in extant single-stranded segmented RNA viruses, such as influenza virus, and in extant double-stranded segmented RNA viruses such as reovirus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=6209512 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(84)80178-2 |volume=110 |issue=3 |title=Origin of sex |date=October 1984 |pages=323–351 |vauthors=Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RE |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to conditions that cause RNA damage could have led to blockage of replication and death of these early RNA life forms. Sex would have allowed re-assortment of segments between two individuals with damaged RNA, permitting undamaged combinations of RNA segments to come together, thus allowing survival. Such a regeneration phenomenon, known as multiplicity reactivation, occurs in influenza virus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barry RD |year=1961 |title=The multiplication of influenza virus. II. Multiplicity reactivation of ultraviolet irradiated virus |journal=Virology |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=398–405 |pmid=13687359 |doi=10.1016/0042-6822(61)90330-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reovirus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McClain ME, Spendlove RS |year=1966 |title=Multiplicity reactivation of reovirus particles after exposure to ultraviolet light |journal=J Bacteriol |volume=92 |issue=5 |pages=1422–1429 |pmid=5924273 |pmc=276440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parasitic DNA elements===
Another theory is that sexual reproduction originated from [[Selfish DNA|selfish parasitic genetic elements]] that exchange genetic material (that is: copies of their own genome) for their transmission and propagation. In some organisms, sexual reproduction has been shown to enhance the spread of parasitic genetic elements (e.g.: yeast, filamentous fungi).&lt;ref name="hickey"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hickey D |title=Selfish DNA: a sexually-transmitted nuclear parasite |journal=Genetics |volume=101 |issue=3–4 |pages=519–531 |year=1982 |pmid=6293914 |pmc=1201875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bacterial conjugation]] is a form of genetic exchange that some sources describe as “sex”, but technically is not a form of reproduction, even though it is a form of [[horizontal gene transfer]]. However, it does support the “selfish gene” part theory, since the gene itself is propagated through the [[F-plasmid]].&lt;ref name="tatiana" /&gt;

A similar origin of sexual reproduction is proposed to have evolved in ancient [[haloarchaea]] as a combination of two independent processes: [[jumping genes]] and [[plasmid]] swapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Extreme Microbes |first=Shiladitya |last=DasSarma |year=2007 |volume=95 |pages=224–231 |doi=10.1511/2007.65.224 |journal=American Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial predation===
A third theory is that sex evolved as a form of [[cannibalism]]: One primitive organism ate another one, but instead of completely digesting it, some of the “eaten” organism's DNA was incorporated into the DNA of the “eater”.&lt;ref name="tatiana" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ploompuu1999/&gt;

===Vaccination-like process===
Sex may also be derived from another prokaryotic process. A comprehensive theory called “origin of sex as vaccination” proposes that eukaryan sex-as-[[fertilisation|syngamy]] (fusion sex) arose from prokaryan unilateral sex-as-infection, when infected hosts began swapping nuclearised genomes containing coevolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that provided protection against horizontal superinfection by other, more virulent symbionts.

Consequently, sex-as-meiosis (fission sex) would evolve as a host strategy for uncoupling from (and thereby render impotent) the acquired symbiotic/parasitic genes.&lt;ref name="sterrer"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sterrer W |title=On the origin of sex as vaccination |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=216 |issue=4 |pages=387–396 |year=2002 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.2002.3008 |pmid=12151256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanistic origin of sexual reproduction==
While theories positing fitness benefits that led to the origin of sex are often problematic{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}, several theories addressing the emergence of the mechanisms of sexual reproduction have been proposed.

===Viral eukaryogenesis===
{{main| Viral eukaryogenesis}}
The viral eukaryogenesis (VE) theory proposes that eukaryotic cells arose from a combination of a [[lysogenic]] virus, an [[archaea]]n, and a [[bacterium]]. This model suggests that the nucleus originated when the lysogenic virus incorporated genetic material from the archaean and the bacterium and took over the role of information storage for the amalgam. The archaeal host transferred much of its functional genome to the virus during the evolution of cytoplasm, but retained the function of gene translation and general metabolism. The bacterium transferred most of its functional genome to the virus as it transitioned into a [[mitochondria|mitochondrion]].&lt;ref name="bell-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bell, PJ |title=Viral eukaryogenesis: Was the ancestor of the nucleus a complex DNA virus? |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=251–256 |year=2001 |doi=10.1007/s002390010215 |pmid=11523012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For these transformations to lead to the eukaryotic cell cycle, the VE hypothesis specifies a pox-like virus as the lysogenic virus. A pox-like virus is a likely ancestor because of its fundamental similarities with eukaryotic nuclei. These include a double stranded DNA genome, a linear chromosome with short [[telomere|telomeric]] repeats, a complex membrane bound capsid, the ability to produce capped mRNA, and the ability to export the capped mRNA across the viral membrane into the [[cytoplasm]]. The presence of a lysogenic pox-like virus ancestor explains the development of meiotic division, an essential component of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="bell-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bell, PJ |title=Sex and the eukaryotic cell cycle is consistent with a viral ancestry for the eukaryotic nucleus |journal=Journal of Theoretical  Biology |volume=243 |issue=1 |pages=54–63 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.05.015 |pmid=16846615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meiotic]] division in the VE hypothesis arose because of the evolutionary pressures placed on the lysogenic virus as a result of its inability to enter into the [[lytic cycle]]. This selective pressure resulted in the development of processes allowing the viruses to spread horizontally throughout the population. The outcome of this selection was cell-to-cell fusion. (This is distinct from the conjugation methods used by bacterial plasmids under evolutionary pressure, with important consequences.)&lt;ref name="bell-2001" /&gt; The possibility of this kind of fusion is supported by the presence of fusion proteins in the envelopes of the pox viruses that allow them to fuse with host membranes. These proteins could have been transferred to the cell membrane during viral reproduction, enabling cell-to-cell fusion between the virus host and an uninfected cell. The theory proposes meiosis originated from the fusion between two cells infected with related but different viruses which recognised each other as uninfected. After the fusion of the two cells, incompatibilities between the two viruses result in a meiotic-like cell division.&lt;ref name="bell-2006" /&gt;

The two viruses established in the cell would initiate replication in response to signals from the host cell. A mitosis-like cell cycle would proceed until the viral membranes dissolved, at which point linear chromosomes would be bound together with centromeres. The homologous nature of the two viral centromeres would incite the grouping of both sets into tetrads. It is speculated that this grouping may be the origin of crossing over, characteristic of the first division in modern meiosis. The partitioning apparatus of the mitotic-like cell cycle the cells used to replicate independently would then pull each set of chromosomes to one side of the cell, still bound by centromeres. These centromeres would prevent their replication in subsequent division, resulting in four daughter cells with one copy of one of the two original pox-like viruses. The process resulting from combination of two similar pox viruses within the same host closely mimics meiosis.&lt;ref name="bell-2006" /&gt;

===Neomuran revolution===
An alternative theory, proposed by [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]], was labeled the [[Neomura|Neomuran revolution]]. The designation "Neomuran revolution" refers to the appearances of the common ancestors of eukaryotes and archaea. Cavalier-Smith proposes that the first neomurans emerged 850 million years ago. Other molecular biologists assume that this group appeared much earlier, but Cavalier-Smith dismisses these claims because they are based on the "theoretically and empirically" unsound model of [[molecular clock]]s. Cavalier-Smith's theory of the Neomuran revolution has implications for the evolutionary history of the cellular machinery for recombination and sex. It suggests that this machinery evolved in two distinct bouts separated by a long period of stasis; first the appearance of recombination machinery in a bacterial ancestor which was maintained for 3 Gy,{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} until the neomuran revolution when the mechanics were adapted to the presence of [[nucleosome]]s. The archaeal products of the revolution maintained recombination machinery that was essentially bacterial, whereas the eukaryotic products broke with this bacterial continuity. They introduced cell fusion and ploidy cycles into cell life histories. Cavalier-Smith argues that both bouts of mechanical evolution were motivated by similar selective forces: the need for accurate DNA replication without loss of viability.&lt;ref name="TCSmith"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cavalier-Smith, Thomas |title=Cell evolution and Earth history: Stasis and revolution |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=361 |issue=1470 |pages=969–1006 |year=2006 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1842 |pmid=16754610 |pmc=1578732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Questions==
Some questions biologists have attempted to answer include:
* Why sexual reproduction exists, if in many organisms it has a 50% cost (fitness disadvantage) in relation to asexual reproduction?&lt;ref name="Ridley M 2004 p. 314"&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Did [[mating type]]s (types of gametes, according to their compatibility) arise as a result of [[anisogamy]] (gamete dimorphism), or did mating types evolve before anisogamy?&lt;ref&gt;T. Togashi, P. Cox (Eds.) ''The Evolution of Anisogamy''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 2011, p. 22-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014).

Online resources, [http://www.oup.co.uk/companion/beukeboom].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Why do most sexual organisms use a binary [[mating system]]?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Czárán | first1 = T.L. | last2 = Hoekstra | first2 = R.F. | year = 2006 | title = Evolution of sexual asymmetry | url = | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 34–46 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Why do some organisms have gamete dimorphism?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6321">In [[artificial intelligence]] and in heuristic [[decision-making]], a '''fast-and-frugal tree''' is a type of [[classification tree]]. Fast-and-frugal trees can be used as  decision-making tools which operate as lexicographic classifiers, and, if required, associate an action (decision) to each class or category.&lt;ref name=naive&gt;Martignon, Laura; Vitouch, Oliver; Takezawa, Masanori; Forster, Malcolm. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27278577_Naive_and_Yet_Enlightened_From_Natural_Frequencies_to_Fast_and_Frugal_Decision_Trees "Naive and Yet Enlightened: From Natural Frequencies to Fast and Frugal Decision Trees"], published in ''Thinking : Psychological perspectives on reasoning, judgement and decision making'' (David Hardman and Laura Macchi; editors), Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The original fast-and-frugal trees introduced in 2003 by [[Laura Martignon]], et al. are simple both in execution and in construction, and constitute a kind of simple [[heuristic]] in the adaptive toolbox postulated by [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition.&lt;ref name=naive /&gt; Similar models had been previously used by Martignon &amp; Hoffrage, 1999; Green and Mehr, 1997  {{ran|GM}}; Dhami and Ayton, 2001 {{ran|DA}}; Dhami and Harries, 2001 {{ran|DH}} and Fischer, Steiner, Zucol, Berger, Martignon, et al. 2002 {{ran|FZBM}}. 

Yet recent developments in several fields of application have maintained the simplicity in execution, introducing subtle, relevant  procedures for construction that have proven extremely useful for users.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21381858 ''Luan, Sheng Hua, Schooler, Lael &amp; Gigerenzer Gerd Psychol Rev.''] 2011 Apr;118(2):316-38. doi: 10.1037/a0022684. A signal-detection analysis of fast-and-frugal trees. Luan, S.; Schooler, LJ; Gigerenzer, G.&lt;/ref&gt;

== How a fast-and-frugal tree works ==
The basic elements on which to ground a binary classification are (sets of) cues.  The fast-and-frugal tree establishes a ranking and, according to the ranking, a “topology” of the tree. Once the ranking is established, the fast-and-frugal tree checks one cue at a time, and at each step, one of the possible outcomes of the considered cue is an exit node which allows for a decision.

Fast-and-frugal trees can also be described in terms of their building blocks. First, they have a search rule: They inspect cues in a specific order. Second, they have a stopping rule: Each cue has one value that leads to an exit node and hence to a classification, and another value that leads to consulting the next cue in the cue hierarchy (the exception being the last cue in the hierarchy, which has two exit nodes). Finally, they have a classification rule.  

[[File:Fast-and-Frugal-Tree.jpg|alt=Example of Fast-and-Frugal Tree|thumb|410x410px|Figure 1: An example of Fast-and-Frugal Tree]]
Figure 1 illustrates a fast-and-frugal tree for classifying a patient as “high risk” of having a heart stroke and thus having to be sent to the “coronary care unit” or “low risk” and thus having to be sent to a “regular nursing bed {{ran|GM}} (Green&amp; Mehr, 1997). 
Fast-and-frugal trees have been characterized mathematically as lexicographic classifiers (Martignon, Katsikopoulos and Woike, 2008) and as linear classifiers with non-compensatory weights (Martignon, Katsikopoulos and Woike, 2008) {{ran|MKW}}. Their “topology” and construction has been analysed using signal detection theory (Luan, Schooler and Gigerenzer, 2011) {{ran|LSG}} and their performance and robustness when compared to regression and CARts has been studied by Laskey and Martignon (2014){{ran|LM}}. An extensive study on the robustness, the predictive value and sensitivity/specificity of Fast-And-Frugal trees compared to those of [[Naive Bayes]] and of Full Natural Frequency Trees has been carried out by{{ran|WHM}}.

In 2017, Phillips, Neth, Woike and Gaissmaier {{ran|PNWG}} introduced the R package [https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FFTrees FFTrees], which uses new algorithms to construct and evaluate FFTs. A simulation study across ten real-world data sets shows that FFTs created by FFTrees can predict data as well as more complex classification algorithms, while remaining simple enough for anyone to understand and use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2834">'''Galactic Bridges and Tails''' is a computer animation film created in 1972 by astrophysicists [[Alar Toomre]] and [http://lcd-www.colorado.edu/jtoomre/ Juri Toomre]. The brothers created the film as a teaching aid to accompany their 1972 landmark research paper of the same name, published in ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]'', which described [[interacting galaxy|galaxy collisions]] and [[galaxy merger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Galactic Bridges and Tails |last1=Toomre |first1=Alar |last2=Toomre |first2=Juri |publisher=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |date=December 1972 |doi=10.1086/151823 |access-date=13 July 2016 |bibcode=1972ApJ...178..623T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology of the original animated film ==
The Toomre film contains both [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[3D computer graphics]] simulations of colliding galaxies. The animations are [[time-lapse]]s that compress billions of years into just a few minutes. Written in the [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] programming language, the simulations sent character and vector information to a CRT-based [[ASCII]] character film recorder. The film recorder exposed multiple frames of [[16mm]] film to create the final animated film.&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kinotonik.net/mindcine/toomre/ |title=Galactic Bridges and Tails (Film Restoration) |last=Lauter |first=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital film restoration ==
In 2007, filmmaker [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0491592/ Michael Lauter] worked with the Toomre brothers to digitally restore the 16mm original film and create a new [[High-definition video|HD video]] (1080p24) digital master.&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt;

== Derivative simulations ==
Massachusetts-based [[MathWorks]] created a [[Simulink]] model titled ''Spiral Galaxy Formation Simulation'' for use within their [[MATLAB]] programming environment. The company states that their computer animation model was inspired by the original ''Galactic Bridges and Tails'' paper and film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spiral Galaxy Formation Simulation Using Embedded MATLAB Functions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225035938/http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/demos.html?file=%2Fproducts%2Fdemos%2Fshipping%2Fsimulink%2Fsldemo_eml_galaxy_script.html |access-date=13 July 2016 |archive-date=25 February 2008 |url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/demos.html?file=/products/demos/shipping/simulink/sldemo_eml_galaxy_script.html |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gemma''' (plural ''gemmae'') is a single [[cell (biology)|cell]], or a mass of cells, or a modified bud of tissue, that detaches from the parent and develops into a new individual. This type of asexual reproduction is referred to as [[fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]]. It is a means of [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] propagation in [[plant]]s. These structures are  commonly found in [[fungi]], [[alga]]e, [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s and [[moss]]es, but also in some [[flowering plant]]s such as pygmy [[sundew]]s and some species of [[butterwort]]s.&lt;ref name="Sundew"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cascadecarnivores.com/index.php?cPath=34 | title=Pygmy Sundew Gemmae | publisher=Cascade Carnivores | work=Pygmy Sundew Gemmae | date=2011 | accessdate=December 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite book | title=On conidia of fungi, and gemmae of algae, bryophytes and pteridophytes | publisher=NRC Research Press | author=Hughes, Stanley John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vascular plants have many other methods of asexual reproduction including [[bulbils]] and [[Turion (botany)|turions]].

== In mosses and liverworts ==
[[File:Thallose liverwort (Marchantia and Lunularia spp.) showing clonal plantlets in gemma cups.jpg|thumb|Liverworts ''[[Marchantia polymorpha|Marchantia]]'' with round cups, and ''[[Lunularia]]'' with crescent cups, both containing gemmae. Gemmae dislodged by rain are visible at the bottom of the image]]

The production of gemmae is a widespread means of asexual reproduction in both liverworts and mosses. In liverworts such as ''[[Marchantia polymorpha|Marchantia]]'', the flattened plant body or thallus is a [[haploid]] [[gametophyte]] with gemma cups scattered about its upper surface. The gemma cups are cup-like structures containing gemmae.  The gemmae are small discs of haploid tissue, and they directly give rise to new gametophytes. They are dispersed from gemma cups by rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, AJE (1989) ''The Liverworts of Britain and Ireland'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gemmae are bilaterally symmetrical and are not differentiated into dorsal and ventral surfaces. The mature gemmae fall on the ground and if conditions are suitable their germination starts immediately. The surface of the gemma which comes in contact of the soil gives out many rhizoids. This surface eventually becomes the lower(ventral) surface of the thallus. Meanwhile, the apical cells present in the two lateral notches become active and form two thalli in opposite directions.

'''HTTP Flood''' is a type of [[Distributed denial of service attack|Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]] attack in which the attacker manipulates [[HTTP]] and [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] unwanted requests in order to attack a [[web server]] or application. These attacks often use interconnected computers that have been taken over with the aid of [[malware]] such as [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan Horses]]. Instead of using malformed packets, [[IP address spoofing|spoofing]] and [[Reflection (computer programming)|reflection]] techniques, HTTP floods require less [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to attack the targeted sites or servers.

== Attack description ==
In an HTTP flood, the HTTP clients such as [[web browser]] interact with an application or server to send HTTP requests. The request can be either “GET” or “POST”. The aim of the attack is when to compel the server to allocate as many resources as possible to serving the attack, thus denying legitimate users access to the server's resources.

=== GET flood ===
The GET request is used to retrieve static content like images. Typically this induces relatively low load on the server per request.

=== POST flood ===
{{main article|HTTP POST flood}}
POST requests are more likely to require the server to perform some kind of processing, such as looking up items in a database. Therefore, HTTP POST flood attacks typically impose higher load on the server per request.

== Methods of mitigation ==
As HTTP flood attacks use standard URL requests hence it is quite challenging to differentiate from valid traffic. One of the most effective mitigation methods is the combination of traffic profiling methods that mainly includes identification of IP reputation, tracking abnormal actions and employing progressive sanctuary challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/02/layer-7-ddos-blocking-http-flood-attacks.html|title=Layer 7 DDOS – Blocking HTTP Flood Attacks|last=Cid|first=Daniel|date=February 6, 2014|website=Sucuri Blog|publisher=|access-date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gallee.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]]: "''Forsachistu diobolae..''" (Forsake devils) and "''gelobistu in got alamehtigan fadaer''" (believe in god almighty father). Left caption in a later writing: "''Abrinuciatio diaboli lingua Teotisca veter''." = (abjuration of the devil in Old German). Under the Baptismal Vow in Latin an enumeration of the first 20 practices in the Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum.]]

The '''''Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum''''' (''Small index of superstitions and paganism'') is a [[Latin]] collection of [[Capitulary|capitularies]] identifying and condemning superstitious and pagan beliefs found in the north of [[Gaul]]&lt;ref name=dierkens24&gt;Dierkens 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and among the [[Saxon]]s during the time of their subjugation and conversion by [[Charlemagne]].

From the original manuscript only the cover remains, which lists thirty chapters. The manuscript is held in the [[Vatican Library]] in a collection (''Codex Palatinus Latinus'' 577) which probably originates from [[Fulda]] and thence traveled to [[Mainz]], arriving there in 1479. From Mainz it went to the [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] in [[Heidelberg]], and arrived in Rome at the latest in 1623. Preceding the ''Indiculus'' is the so-called [[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]]. The text is edited in the ''Karlomanni Principis Capitulare'', published by the [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]].

==Date==
''Codex Palatinus Latinus'' 577 itself appears to have been copied ca. 800 in either Fulda or [[Mainz]]. Alain Dierkens argues, on the basis of word choice (the correspondence between the phrase ''superstitionem et paganiarum'' and the diction used by Boniface in his 742&lt;ref&gt;Tangl, letter 50, 80ff.&lt;/ref&gt; letter to [[Pope Zachary]]) and a comparison between the content of the ''Indiculus'' and the conclusions of the [[Concilium Germanicum]] (744), that the ''Indiculus'' was indeed appended to or pertained to the decisions made at the Concilium Germanicum and the two consequent Frankish synods at Estinnes and Soissons.&lt;ref&gt;Dierkens 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, they were not the product of a late-seventh century scribe at Fulda, nor were the prohibitions aimed specifically or exclusively at the Saxons.&lt;ref name=dierkens24/&gt;

==Significance==
The index provides valuable insight into the religious culture of the pagan Saxons (from the Christian point of view) and into the daily practices of Christian missionaries working in that area. Since it is more or less contemporary with the activities of [[Saint Boniface]] in modern-day Germany, he has been called a "guiding influence" on its compilation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qh1lrIM5nd4C&amp;pg=PA173 Filotas 173.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alain Dierkens, the ''Indiculus'', which he thinks derives from the "entourage" of Boniface, evidences the ongoing practice of pre-Christian practices, including divination, the use of amulets, magic, and witchcraft, and suggests that the church allowed or transformed certain practices which it had been unable to extirpate.&lt;ref&gt;Dierkens 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology''' ('''ISMB''') is an annual [[academic conference]] on the subjects of [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]] organised by the [[International Society for Computational Biology]] (ISCB). The principal focus of the conference is on the development and application of advanced computational methods for biological problems. The conference has been held every year since 1993 and has grown to become one of the largest and most prestigious meetings in these fields, hosting over 2,000 delegates in 2004.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linial2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Linial | first1 = M. | last2 = Mesirov | first2 = J.

Since 2004, European meetings have been held jointly with the [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] (ECCB).

The main ISMB conference is usually held over three days and consists of presentations, [[poster session]]s and [[keynote|keynote talks]]. Most presentations are given in multiple parallel tracks; however, keynote talks are presented in a single track and are chosen to reflect outstanding research in bioinformatics. Notable ISMB keynote speakers have included eight Nobel laureates. The recipients of the ISCB [[Overton Prize]] and [[ISCB Senior Scientist Awards|ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award]] are invited to give keynote talks as part of the programme. The proceedings of the conference are currently published by the journal ''[[Bioinformatics (journal)|Bioinformatics]]''.

==History==
[[File:Larry hunter computer scientist.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white portrait of Lawrence Hunter|[[Lawrence Hunter]], co-chair of the first ISMB conference.]]

===Early meetings===
The origins of the ISMB conference lie in a workshop for [[artificial intelligence]] researchers with an interest in [[molecular biology]] held in November 1991.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Todd A.|title=The Roots of Bioinformatics in ISMB|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|volume=8|issue=8|pages=e1002679|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002679|pmid=22952443|pmc=3431341|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The workshop was organised by [[United States of America|American]] researcher [[Lawrence Hunter]], then director of the Machine Learning Project at the United States [[National Institutes of Health]]'s [[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Searls1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Searls|first=D.|author2=Shavlik, J. |author3=Hunter, L. |title=The First International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology|journal=AI Magazine|year=1994|volume=15|issue=1|pages=12–13|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/1082/1000|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent workshop on the same topic held in 1992, hosted by the NLM and the [[National Science Foundation]], made it clear that a regular international conference for the field was required. Such a conference would be dedicated to molecular biology as a rapidly emerging application of artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name="about-ismb"&gt;{{cite web|title=About ISMB|url=http://www.iscb.org/about-ismb|work=www.iscb.org|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having successfully applied for grants from [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence|AAAI]], [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] and the [[Office of Science#Biological and Environmental Research|Department of Energy Office of Health and Environmental Research]], the first ISMB conference was held in July 1993, at the NLM. The conference was chaired by Hunter, [[David Searls]] (research associate professor at [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]]) and [[Jude Shavlik]] (assistant professor of computer science at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]) and attracted over 200 attendees from 13 countries,&lt;ref name="Searls1994" /&gt; submitting 69 scientific papers.&lt;ref name=Gibson2012 /&gt;

The success of the first conference prompted the announcement of a second ISMB conference at the end of the meeting. ISMB 1994 was initially planned to be held in [[Seattle]]. However, a competing meeting forced ISMB to change venues at short notice. The conference was held at [[Stanford University]] in August 1994 and was organised by [[Russ Altman]], a research scientist at [[Stanford University School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=Gibson2012 /&gt; To emphasise the international aspect of the conference, ISMB 1995 was held at [[Robinson College, Cambridge]]. ISMB 1995 also marked a shift in the focus of the conference. [[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]] Board member and Director of the [[Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute]] [[Alfonso Valencia]] has stated that, in 1995, "the conference changed from a computer science-based conference to a point where everyone realized that, if you want to make progress, there has to be more focus in biology."&lt;ref name=Gibson2012 /&gt;

===Formation of ISCB and expansion===
ISMB 1997 was held in [[Halkidiki]], [[Greece]] and marked the foundation of the [[International Society for Computational Biology]] (ISCB).&lt;ref name="about-ismb" /&gt; ISCB was formed with a focus on managing all scientific, organizational and financial aspects of the ISMB conference and to provide a forum for scientists to address the emerging role of computers in the biological sciences. ISCB has assisted in organising the ISMB conference series since 1998.&lt;ref name="Linial2008" /&gt; The period following the formation of ISCB also marked an expansion in the number of ISMB attendees: ISMB 2000 (held at the [[University of California, San Diego]]) was attended by over 1,000 delegates,&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; submitting 141 scientific papers.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; This meeting was also the last time ISMB would be held at a university, due to size limitations.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;

===Partnership with ECCB===
[[File:Wfm secc front.jpg|thumb|alt=The entrance to the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre|The first joint conference with [[European Conference on Computational Biology|ECCB]] was held in 2004 at the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]].]]
In 2004, ISMB was jointly held with the [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] for the first time. The conference was also co-located with the Genes, Proteins and Computers conference. This meeting, held in [[Glasgow]], [[UK]], was the largest [[bioinformatics]] conference ever held,&lt;ref name=iscb-history&gt;{{cite web|title=History of ISCB|url=http://www.iscb.org/iscb-history|work=www.iscb.org|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; attended by 2,136 delegates, submitting 496 scientific papers.&lt;ref name=ismbeccb2004&gt;{{cite web|title=ISMB/ECCB 2004|url=http://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2004/|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfonso Valencia considers ISMB/ECCB 2004 to be an important milestone in the history of ISMB: "it was the first one where the balance between Europe and the States became an important part of the conference. It was here that we established the rules and the ways and the spirit of collaboration between the Americans and the Europeans."&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; The success of the joint conference paved the way for future European ISMB meetings to be held jointly with ECCB.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt;

===Recent meetings===
By the end of 2006, ISCB was in financial difficulty. Two conferences (ISMB 2003, in [[Brisbane]] and ISMB 2006, in [[Fortaleza]]) had drastically reduced numbers of participants due to their location, with a corresponding reduction in income.&lt;ref name="Rost2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rost|first=B.|title=ISCB: past-present perspective for the International Society for Computational Biology|journal=Bioinformatics|date=14 November 2013|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btt629|pmid=24234004|pmc=5994947|volume=29|issue=24|pages=3243–3245}}&lt;/ref&gt; To allow more delegates to attend, it was decided to limit conference locations to North America and Europe. In January 2007, ISMB and ECCB agreed to hold joint conferences in Europe every other year, beginning with ISMB/ECCB 2007.&lt;ref name="Linial2008" /&gt; ISMB would be held in North America in the years between joint meetings. {{As of|2016}}, this pattern has been confirmed to continue until at least 2019. ISMB/ECCB 2007 (held in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]) marked the first conference for which ISCB took full responsibility for organising.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; Vienna became the first city to host ISMB twice with ISMB/ECCB 2011. This 'return visit' was an experiment intended to reduce the increasing effort required to find suitable conference venues. Although the return to Vienna was only deemed partially successful due to price increases, [[Boston]] (which hosted ISMB 2010 and 2014) is predicted to become a 'safe' site which ISMB can periodically return to.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;

ISMB celebrated its 20th meeting with ISMB 2012, held in [[Long Beach, California]]. This event attracted around 1,600 delegates,&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; submitting 268 scientific papers.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; Richard H. Lathrop and Lawrence Hunter presented a special keynote presentation, looking back at previous ISMB meetings and attempting to predict where the field of [[bioinformatics]] may head in the future.&lt;ref name=ismb2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Keynotes|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismb2012-program/ismb2012-keynotes|work=ISMB 2012|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISMB/ECCB 2013 was held in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] and was attended by around 2,000 delegates, submitting 233 scientific papers.&lt;ref name="Ben-Tal2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ben-Tal|first=N.|title=Editorial|journal=Bioinformatics|date=21 June 2013|volume=29|issue=13|pages=i1–i2|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btt282|pmid=23812973|pmc=3694647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Academic paper]]s at ISMB were traditionally presented in a single track.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; Presentations at ISMB 1994 were split further into three themed days, focusing on [[Protein structure prediction#Secondary structure|protein secondary structure prediction]], [[sequence analysis]] and AI techniques and biochemical applications, respectively.&lt;ref name="Searls1994" /&gt; As attendance at ISMB increased, the single track approach became increasingly unsustainable and two parallel tracks were introduced at ISMB/ECCB 2004. Further expansion meant that, by ISMB 2012, over 200 talks were presented in nine parallel tracks&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; including multiple [[proceedings]] tracks, a highlights track and a technology track. The introduction of parallel tracks to ISMB was controversial. [[Christopher Rawlings]] (head of Computational and Systems Biology at [[Rothamsted Research]] and organiser of ISMB 1995) has said: "There were a lot of people who wanted to keep it more strongly in the AI intelligent systems model and have a meeting where everybody would go to everything. But it just grew too big. We just couldn’t."&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; As the number of submitted [[proceedings]] papers has increased, the acceptance rate has decreased dramatically, from 75% in 1994 to 13% in 2012.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; ISMB proceedings from 1993-2000 were published by [[AAAI Press]]. Since ISMB 2001, proceedings have been published in the journal ''[[Bioinformatics (journal)|Bioinformatics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISMB Proceedings|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismb-proceedings|work=www.iscb.org|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunak|first=S.|author2=Krogh, A.|title=ISMB 2001|journal=Bioinformatics|date=1 June 2001|volume=17|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S1–S4|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.S1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of posters presented at ISMB has also increased dramatically. 25 posters were presented at ISMB 1994;&lt;ref name="Searls1994" /&gt; at recent ISMB meetings, 500-1,000 posters have been presented in multiple poster sessions.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;

[[Keynote|Keynote talks]] are presented in a single track and generally attract the largest audience.&lt;ref name="Linial2008" /&gt; These presentations are chosen to highlight outstanding research in the field of [[bioinformatics]]. Notable [[List of Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology keynote speakers|ISMB keynote speakers]] have included eight [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureates]]: [[Richard J. Roberts]] (keynote speaker in 1994, 2006), [[John Sulston]] (1995), [[Manfred Eigen]] (1999), [[Gerald Edelman]] (2000), [[Sydney Brenner]] (2003), [[Kurt Wüthrich]] (2006), [[Robert Huber]] (2006) and [[Michael Levitt]] (2015).&lt;ref name=about-ismb /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neshich2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neshich|first=Goran|author2=Bourne, Philip E. |author3=Brunak, Søren |title=ISMB 2006|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|date=1 January 2006|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e11|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020011|pmid=16758006|pmc=1378106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ismb2015keynotes&gt;{{cite web|title=Keynotes|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2015-program/ismbeccb2015-keynotes|work=ISMB/ECCB 2015|publisher=ISCB|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, ISMB runs on a budget in excess of $1.5M and, in terms of proceeds, brings in four times that of the other ISCB conferences (ISCB-Latin America, [[ISCB Africa ASBCB Bioinformatics Conference|ISCB-Africa]], ISCB-Asia, Rocky Mountain Bioinformatics Conference, [[CSHALS]] and the Great Lakes Bioinformatics Conference) combined.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; Standard registration fees (as of 2013) are around $1,000 for academics who are ISCB members ($1,350 for non-members), with lower rates for students and higher rates for corporate delegates respectively. Discounts are provided for early registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REGISTER|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013-registration#registrationfee|work=ISMB/ECCB 2013|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite events===
Pre-conference tutorials have played an important role in ISMB since the first conference.&lt;ref name="Linial2008" /&gt; Tutorials at ISMB 1994 included introductions to [[genetic algorithms]], [[neural networks]], [[artificial intelligence|AI]] for molecular biologists and [[molecular biology]] for computer scientists.&lt;ref name="Searls1994" /&gt; Tutorials on computational [[mass spectrometry]]-based [[proteomics]] and [[ENCODE]] data access were presented at ISMB/ECCB 2013.&lt;ref name=iscbeccb2013-tutorials&gt;{{cite web|title=Tutorials|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013-program/ismbeccb2013-tutorials|work=ISMB/ECCB 2013|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As attendance at ISMB grew in the late 1990s, several satellite meetings and special interest group (SIG) meetings formed alongside the main conference. SIG meetings are held over one or two days before the main conference and focus on a specific topic, allowing more detailed discussion than there would be time for in the main conference.&lt;ref name=ismbeccb2013-sigs&gt;{{cite web|title=SIGs &amp; Satellite Meetings|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013-program/ismbeccb2013-satellite-meetings|work=ISMB/ECCB 2013|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable SIG meetings include the [[Bioinformatics Open Source Conference]] (BOSC), which has been held annually since 2000&lt;ref name=bosc&gt;{{cite web|title=BOSC - Open Bioinformatics Foundation|url=http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Past_BOSC_conferences |publisher=[[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bio-Ontologies, which has been held annually since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-last1=Bodenreider|author-first1=Olivier|author-last2=Stevens|author-first2=Robert|title=Bio-ontologies: current trends and future directions|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=7|issue=3|pages=256–274|doi=10.1093/bib/bbl027|pmid=16899495|pmc=1847325|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite meetings are usually two days long and are held in conjunction with ISMB. The 12th CAMDA conference and the 9th 3DSIG meeting were held as satellite meetings of ISMB/ECCB 2013.&lt;ref name=3dsig-2013&gt;{{cite web|title=3DSIG 2013 - Structural Bioinformatics and Computational Biophysics, Berlin 2013|url=http://bcb.med.usherbrooke.ca/3dsig13/|work=3DSIG 2013|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=camda-2013&gt;{{cite web|title=CAMDA 2013 Conference - CAMDA 2013|url=http://dokuwiki.bioinf.jku.at/doku.php|work=CAMDA 2013|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the film|Intermedio (film)}}

The '''intermedio''' {{IPA-it|interˈmɛːdjo|}} (also '''intromessa''', '''introdutto''', '''tramessa''', '''tramezzo''', '''intermezzo'''), in the [[Italian Renaissance]], was a theatrical  performance or spectacle with [[Renaissance music|music]] and often dance which was performed between the acts of a play to celebrate special occasions in Italian [[noble court|courts]].  It was one of the important predecessors to [[opera]], and an influence on other forms like the English court [[masque]].  Weddings in ruling families and similar state occasions were the usual occasion for the most lavish intermedi, in cities such as [[Florence]] and [[Ferrara]].  Some of the best documentation of intermedi comes from weddings in the [[Medici]] family, in particular the 1589 Medici wedding (between [[Christina, Grand Duchess of Tuscany|Christina of Lorraine]] and [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]]), which featured what was undoubtedly both the most spectacular set of intermedi, and the best known, thanks to no fewer than 18 contemporary published festival books and sets of [[old master print|prints]] that were financed by the Grand Duke.&lt;ref&gt;Reed &amp; Wallace:205-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermedi were written and performed from the late 15th century through the 17th century, although the peak of development of the genre was in the late 16th century.  After 1600 the form merged with opera, for the most part, though intermedi continued to be used in non-musical plays in certain settings (for example in academies), and also continued to be performed between the acts of operas.

==Development==
The first intermedii were  not in Florence but in [[Ferrara]] at the end of the 15th century between the five acts of plays by the classical authors [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]]. Writing of the "intermezzi" at the wedding of [[Lucrezia Borgia]] in 1502, [[Isabella d'Este]] said that they were more interesting than the boring ''commedia'', "a remark destined to be often repeated".&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 105&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferrara intermezzi at this period were short and without a unifying theme; they included choruses, recitations and ''[[moresca]]'' dances.  But by 1513 there was a unifying [[allegory]], explained at the end.  It was for Florentine public celebrations that Intermedii came into their own; several were organised by [[Machiavelli]] when he was part of the government of the [[Republic of Florence]] in the early 16th century, and the returning Medici adopted a policy of keeping the aristocracy occupied by involving them in productions.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

As the intermedio developed in the 16th century, it grew more and more elaborate, often becoming a "play within a play"; for example during a five-act play, an intermedio would consist of four parts, which might be presented as a four-part metaphor of time passing in the play.  This stage begins with ''Il commodo'', from the Medici wedding in [[Florence]] of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]] and [[Eleanor of Toledo]] in 1539,&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0189 Festival Book online]&lt;/ref&gt; where the four parts were morning, noon, afternoon, and night, represented with an elaborate mechanical artificial sun, with singing and dancing appropriate to each time.  Some critics of the time noted that the intermedi had become so elaborate that the play had begun to serve as intermedi to the intermedi.

==Mature intermedio==
Originally intermedi had used the sets already on the stage from the main play, typically fairly simple ones for a comedy, with a few extra pieces, but later they had their own sets, which a mythological subject required to be more elaborate.  [[Vasari]]'s production for yet another Medici wedding in 1565 "embodied stupendous advances in engineering technique" with all the elaborate movements of scenery done without a curtain in full view of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Strong:134-6&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Roy Strong]]: "the designs for the 1589 intermezzi are crucial, for they are the earliest mass-disseminated illustrations of what became a norm throughout Europe for theatrical visual experience for the next three hundred years, the [[proscenium arch]] behind which receded ranks of side wings, the vista closed by a back-shutter."&lt;ref&gt;Strong:140&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the form acquired a tradition and cohesiveness that allowed it to stand on its own, and it was thus a logical development to combine the existing features with sung, acted parts, and be absorbed into the new artform of opera, which also drew from the traditions of [[monody]] and [[madrigal comedy]]. [[Jacopo Peri]], the composer of [[Dafne]], the first opera, was one of the composers, and almost certainly performers, in the 1589 Medici intermezzi, and the librettist for both, [[Ottavio Rinuccini]], seems to have recycled in ''Dafne'' some of the material from the 1589 Delos scene (illustrated at top).

"Festival books", produced as souvenirs of lavish festivities, contain detailed descriptions of many important intermedi, such as those for the Medici wedding of 1589,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ursusbooks.com/item110358.html Album of engravings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717175205/http://www.ursusbooks.com/item110358.html |date=2011-07-17 }}, showing several of the sets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0205 British Library festival book online text]&lt;/ref&gt; for which 286 costumes were made.  Although music written specially for this occasion survives (see discography below), this is usually not the case, and music written for other occasions, for example [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s and instrumental pieces, was often used in intermedi.  The subject matter of the intermedio was usually a [[mythology|mythological]] or [[pastoral]] story, which could be told in [[mime artist|mime]], by costumed singers or actors, or by [[dance]], or any combination of these.  There was invariably a political message, even if this was limited to general glorification of the ruling family; at times more specific messages were intended.  Some thematic connection with the main play might be made, though intermedii could be repeated with different plays from the one they were written for.  

Numerous drawings and engravings of the stage sets survive, as well as texts of the libretti and descriptions of the music and action; the 1589 Medici intermezzi were especially well recorded, and "were to be the fount of Italian [[baroque]] scenography as well as influencing the development of the stage north of the Alps, above all the Stuart court [[masque]]s designed by [[Inigo Jones]]".&lt;ref&gt;Strong:136&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual content in terms of staging, music, instrumentation, presence of singers, actors, dancers, or mime was highly variable throughout the period, and sometimes all of these features were present.  The 1589 intermedi were performed in the recently completed theatre in the [[Uffizi Palace]] before an audience of about three thousand, and three further performances were given some days after the end of the wedding festivities. 
Further significant sets of Medici intermedi were produced for the weddings in 1600 of [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Marie de' Medici]], and then in 1608 of [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke Cosimo II]] and a [[Habsburg]] princess, [[Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria|Maria Magdalena of Austria]]. However the 1600 celebrations also included a portent of things to come in the form of performances of [[Jacopo Peri]]'s opera ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'', the earliest surviving example of the form.

==Music of the Medici intermedi==
[[Image:La pellegrina 1589 - Intermedio 1 - L'armonia delle sfere.jpg|thumb|Another of the 1589 intermedi: number 1: Harmony descends to earth]]
Of the various intermedi that were performed, only the music to some parts of ''Il commodo''  (1539) and, through a 1591 printed edition by [[Cristofano Malvezzi]], an almost complete version of ''[[The Pilgrim Woman|La Pellegrina]]'' (1589) are known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;liner noters to Sempé, "La Pellegrina", 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1539 most of the pieces are in four and five parts so much of this music is suitable for domestic playing. The 1589 music is very different being largely big set pieces for 6, 12, 18 or even 30 parts; 41 instrumentalists were required in all, some hidden around the stage as there was not room for them all in one place.&lt;ref&gt;Grout and Williams, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Smaller scale pieces are often difficult florid [[monody]] of the [[Giulio Caccini|Caccini]] ''new music'' variety.

Of the surviving intermedi only two numbers were ''[[a cappella]]'', (not counting the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s which were sung at the banquet in 1539 which of course are not intermedi).  This means we have surviving descriptions of precise instrumentation.

Classical humanist dramatic theory says a play should have action taking place during one entire day.  These intermedi do not follow what were believed to be the classical instructions, having an overture item, ''Vattene almo riposo'', and a night time ending for tenor voice accompanied by four [[sackbut]]s and an extra [[coda (music)|coda]] the [[bacchanale]], ''Baccho, Baccho, E U O E''.

==Similar forms outside Italy==

The similar form which developed in France at the same time was called the [[intermède]]; it was more reliant on dance than the Italian version.  The French court under [[Catherine de' Medici]] was also staging [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|court festivities of increasing lavishness]] – Catherine's granddaughter was the Medici bride in 1589.  The [[masque]] in England also had many similarities to the intermedio, although it did not originate as a "filler" between acts in a play in the same way.  The later 18th century [[intermezzo]] in opera showed a reversal of the Renaissance scheme; now a single short comic intermezzo was inserted between the acts of a heroic [[opera seria]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2299">The '''International Academy of Sex Research''' ('''IASR''') is a scientific society for researchers in [[sexology]].  According to [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]], retired director of the [[Kinsey Institute]], IASR "can claim...most of the field's leading researchers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/magazine/25desire-t.html?_r=1&amp;hp The New York Times Magazine. (25 January 2009). ''What is female desire?'' by Daniel Bergner, p. 26.]&lt;/ref&gt;   IASR is unique among sexology organizations in that individuals must be elected to membership, which requires demonstration of substantial contribution to sexology, including the authorship of 10 or more professional publications.  Notable members have included Drs. [[Ray Blanchard]], [[Milton Diamond]], [[Kurt Freund]], [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]], [[Leonore Tiefer]], Judith Becker, and [[Ken Zucker]]. The official journal of IASR is the ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]''.

==History==
IASR was founded on 1 August 1973. The 53 founding charter members were nominated by the board of the journal ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'', which became the official publication of the IASR. The founding editor of ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' was Richard Green.&lt;ref&gt;Green, R. (1985). The International Academy of Sex Research: In the beginning. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 14,'' 293-302.&lt;/ref&gt; The current editor is [[Kenneth Zucker]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.springer.com/public+health/journal/10508?detailsPage=editorialBoard&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual IASR meeting was held at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]] in September 1975. It was hosted by IASR founding president, [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, R. (2001). A 30 years' thank you. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 30,'' 633-637.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4320">'''Intraspecific antagonism''' means a disharmonious or antagonistic interaction between two [[individual]]s of the same [[species]]. As such, it could be a [[sociology|sociological]] term, but was actually coined by [[Alan Rayner]] and [[Norman Kalmer Todd|Norman Todd]] working at [[Exeter University]] in the late 1970s, to characterise a particular kind of [[zone line]] formed between [[wood-rotting fungus|wood-rotting fungal]] [[mycelium|mycelia]]. Intraspecific antagonism is one of the expressions of a phenomenon known as vegetative or somatic incompatibility.&lt;ref name=Worral1997/&gt;

==Fungal individualism==

Zone lines form in [[wood]] for many reasons, including host reactions against [[parasite|parasitic]] encroachment, and inter-specific interactions, but the lines observed by Rayner and Todd when transversely-cut sections of [[Birch bracket|brown-rotted birch]] tree trunk or branch were incubated in plastic bags appeared to be due to a reaction between different individuals of the same species of [[fungus]].&lt;ref name=Rayner1979/&gt;

This was a startling inference at a time when the prevailing orthodoxy within the [[Mycology|mycological]] community was that of the "unit mycelium". This was the theory that when two different individuals of the same species of [[basidiomycete]] wood rotting fungi grew and met within the substratum, they fused, cooperated, and shared nuclei freely.&lt;ref name=Burnett1976/&gt; Rayner and Todd's insight was that basidiomycete fungi individuals do, in most "adult" or [[dikaryon|dikaryotic]] cases anyway, retain their individuality.&lt;ref name=Rayner1977/&gt;

A small stable of postgraduate and postdoctoral students helped elucidate the mechanisms underlying these intermycelial interactions, at [[Exeter University]] (Todd) and the [[University of Bath]] (Rayner), over the next few years.

==Applications of intraspecific antagonism==

[[Image:fungalzoneline.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Zone lines in driftwood'']] Although the attribution of individual status to the mycelia confined by intraspecific zone lines is a comparatively new idea, zone lines themselves have been known since time immemorial. The term [[spalting]] is applied by woodworkers to wood showing strongly-figured zone lines, particularly those cases where the area of "no-man's land" between two antagonistic conspecific mycelia is colonised by another species of fungus. [[Dematiaceous]] hyphomycetes, with their dark-coloured mycelia, produce particularly attractive black zone lines when they colonise the areas occupied by two antagonistic basidiomycete individuals. Spalted wood can be difficult to work, since different individual wood-rotting fungi have different decay efficiencies, and thus produce zones of different softness, and the zone lines themselves are usually unrotted and hard.

Instraspecific antagonism can also sometimes be of assistance in quickly recognising the membership of clones in those fungi, particularly root-rots such as [[Honey fungus|Armillarea]] where individual mycelia may colonise large areas, or more than one tree.

It is even the subject of a recent patent.[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4698305.html]

[[Blasphemy]] in [[Islam]] is impious utterance or action concerning [[God in Islam|God]],  "Blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad and his companions (sabb al-rasul, sabb al-sahabah)"&lt;ref&gt;The introduction of the topic into shafi'i legal literature and its relevance for legal practice under Mamluk rule".

==Islamic scriptures==

In Islamic literature, blasphemy is of many types, and there are many different words for it: ''sabb'' (insult) and ''shatm'' (abuse, vilification), ''takdhib'' or ''tajdif'' (denial), ''iftira'' (concoction), ''la`n'' or ''la'ana'' (curse) and ''ta`n'' (accuse, defame).&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Quran===
Not only does the Quran not prescribe any earthly punishment for blasphemy, it actually advocates a non-violent response.&lt;ref&gt;Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty, Mustafa Akyol, 2013 p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam, 2004 pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; The commanded response is only to "not sit with" those who mock the religion. For example:

{{quote|When you hear God’s revelations disbelieved in and mocked at, do not sit with them until they enter into some other discourse; surely then you would be like them.|[[Qur'an]]|{{quran-usc|4|140}}||}} 

But a variety of punishments, including death, have been instituted in Islamic Jurisprudence, that draw their sources from hadith literature &lt;ref&gt;Siraj Khan. Blasphemy against the Prophet, in Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture (editors: Coeli Fitzpatrick and Adam Hani Walker). {{ISBN|978-1610691772}}, pp. 59–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam, 2004 pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hadiths===
Sources in hadith literature allege that [[Muhammad]] ordered the execution of [[Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Uri. ''The Assassination of Kaʿb b. al-Ashraf.'' Oriens, Vol. 32. (1990), pp. 65–71.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of Badr]], Ka'b had incited the Quraysh against Muhammad, and also urged them to seek vengeance against Muslims. Another person executed was Abu Rafi', who had actively propagandized against Muslims immediately before the [[Battle of Ahzab]]. Both of these men were guilty of insulting Muhammad, and both were guilty of inciting violence. While some{{Who?|date=April 2017}} have explained that these two men were executed for blaspheming against Muhammad, an alternative explanation{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} is that they were executed for treason and causing disorder (''[[fasad]]'') in society.&lt;ref&gt;Siraj Khan (2014), "Blasphemy against the Prophet," ''Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God'', (vol. 1 pp. 62). [[ABC-CLIO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One hadith{{Which?|date=April 2017}} tells of a man who killed his slave because she persisted in insulting Muhammad. Upon hearing this, Muhammad is reported to have exclaimed: "Do you not bear witness that her blood is futile!" (''anna damah hadarun'')&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Abudawud|38|4348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; This expression can be read as meaning that the killing was unnecessary, implying that Muhammad condemned it.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; However, most hadith specialists interpreted it as voiding the obligation of paying the blood money which would normally be due to the woman's next of kin.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; Another hadith reports Muhammad using an expression which clearly indicates the latter meaning: &lt;ref name=khan/&gt;

{{quotation|Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib: A Jewess used to abuse the Prophet and disparage him. A man strangled her till she died. The Apostle of Allah declared that no recompense was payable for her blood.|{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Abudawud|38|4349}}  }}

==Punishment==

===Traditional jurisprudence===
{{Fiqh |criminal}}
The [[Quran]] does not explicitly mention any worldly punishment for blasphemy (''sabb allah'' or ''sabb al-rasul''). Islamic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]) of Sunni and Shia [[madhab]]s have declared different punishments for the religious crime of blasphemy, and they vary between schools. These are as follows:&lt;ref name = "Saeed"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Saeed  | first = Abdullah  |author2=Hassan Saeed  | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam  | publisher = Ashgate Publishing Company  | year = 2004  | location = Burlington VT  | pages = 37–39  | isbn = 978-0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiederhold, Lutz.

He must repent, or else is killed. And this is the same for the woman, except Abu Hanifa said: Do not kill the woman, but coerce her back to Islam.”&lt;/ref&gt; If a non-Muslim commits blasphemy, his punishment must be a [[tazir]] (discretionary, can be death, arrest, caning, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi (933), Mukhtasar Ikhtilaf al-Ulama, vol. 3, p. 504&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.

Some jurists suggest that the sunnah in {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|3|45|687}} and {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|5|59|369}} provide a basis for a death sentence for the crime of blasphemy, even if someone claims not to be an apostate, but has committed the crime of blasphemy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Some modern Muslim scholars contest that Islam supports [[blasphemy law]], stating that [[Ulama|Muslim jurists]] made the offense part of [[Sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;Declan O'Sullivan (2001), The Interpretation of Qur'anic Text to Promote or Negate the Death Penalty for Apostates and Blasphemers, Journal of Qur'anic Studies, 3(2), pp. 63–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/20/islam-ghamidi-pakistan-blasphemy-laws Islamic scholar attacks Pakistan's blasphemy laws] Guardian 20 January 2010.

The Islamic law considers blasphemy against Muhammad a more severe offense than blasphemy against God. Repentance can lead to forgiveness by God when God is blasphemed, however since Muhammad is no longer alive, forgiveness is not possible when Muhammad is blasphemed, and the Muslim community must punish his blasphemy by avenging blasphemer's death.&lt;ref name = "Saeed"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, David A.

A convicted blasphemer may, among other penalties, lose all legal rights. The loss of rights may cause a blasphemer's marriage to be dissolved, religious acts to be rendered worthless, and claims to property—including any inheritance—to be rendered void. Repentance, in some Fiqhs, may restore lost rights except for marital rights; lost marital rights are regained only by remarriage. Women have blasphemed and repented to end a marriage. Muslim women may be permitted to repent, and may receive a lesser punishment than would befall a Muslim man who committed the same offense.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion"/&gt; Most Muslim-majority countries have some form of blasphemy law and some of them have been compared to blasphemy laws in European countries (Britain, Germany, Finland etc.).&lt;ref name="Böwering"/&gt; However, in five countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, blasphemy is punishable by execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OcriBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83 |page= 83 |title= Political Secularism, Religion, and the State: A Time Series Analysis of Worldwide Data |author= Jonathan Fox |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan, more than a thousand people have been convicted of blasphemy since the 1980s; though none have been executed.&lt;ref name="Böwering"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=q1I0pcrFFSUC&amp;pg=PA72 |page=72 |title= The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought |editors= Gerhard Böwering, Patricia Crone, Mahan Mirza |publisher= Princeton University Press |year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blasphemy as apostasy==
{{Main|Apostasy in Islam}}
Blasphemy has historically been seen as an evidence of rejection of Islam, that is, the religious crime of [[apostasy]]. Some jurists believe that blasphemy automatically implies a Muslim has left the fold of Islam.{{sfn|Saeed|2004|p. 38–39}} A Muslim may find himself accused of being a blasphemer, and thus an apostate on the basis of one action or utterance.{{sfn|Saeed|2004|p.48}}&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title = Blasphemy: Islamic Concept |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion |volume = 2 |pages = 974–76 |publisher = Thomson Gale |location = Farmington Hills, MI |year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Islamic sources [[Nadr ibn al-Harith]], who was an Arab Pagan doctor from Taif, used to tell stories of [[Esfandiyār|Rustam and Isfandiyar]] to the Arabs and scoffed Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=js30HODt2aYC&amp;pg=PA179 Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century, Volume 2, Part 2], p. 179, Irfan Shahîd.

According to certain hadiths, after Mecca's fall [[Muhammad]] ordered a number of enemies executed. Based on this early jurists postulated that ''sabb al-Nabi'' (abuse of the Prophet) was a crime "so heinous that repentance was disallowed and summary execution was required".&lt;ref name=kadri-252&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|page=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sadakat Kadri]] writes that the actual prosecutions for blasphemy in the Muslim historical record "are vanishingly infrequent". One of the "few known cases" was that of a Christian accused of insulting the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. It ended in an acquittal in 1293, though it was followed by a protest against a decision led by the famed and strict jurist [[Ibn Taymiyya]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel, ''Muslim Theologian's Response'', pp. 69–71)&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades [[Islamic revival]]ists have called for its enforcement on the grounds that criminalizing hostility toward Islam will safeguard communal cohesion.&lt;ref name=kadri-252/&gt; In one country where strict laws on blaspheme were introduced in the 1980s, [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan|Pakistan]], over 1300 people have been accused of blasphemy from 1987 to 2014, (mostly non-Muslim religious minorities),  mostly for allegedly [[Quran desecration|desecrating]] the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name=bbc-blasphem&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12621225|website=BBC News|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50 people accused of blasphemy have been murdered before their respective trials were over,&lt;ref name=dawn-08182013&gt;{{cite news|title=Timeline: Accused under the Blasphemy Law|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/750512/timeline-accused-under-the-blasphemy-law|accessdate=10 December 2014|agency=Dawn.com|date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aljazeera&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hashim|first1=Asad|title=Living in fear under Pakistan's blasphemy law|journal=Al Jazeera|date=17 May 2014|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/05/living-fear-under-pakistan-blasphemy-law-20145179369144891.html|accessdate=21 November 2014|quote=In Pakistan, 17 people are on death row for blasphemy, and dozens more have been extrajudicially murdered.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prominent figures who opposed blasphemy laws ([[Salman Taseer]], the former governor of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], and [[Shahbaz Bhatti]], the Federal Minister for Minorities) have been assassinated.&lt;ref name=bbc-blasphem/&gt;

New York: Oxford University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, several Islamic nations have argued in the United Nations that blasphemy against Muhammad is unacceptable, and that laws should be passed worldwide to proscribe it. In September 2012, the [[Organisation of Islamic Conference]] (OIC), who has sought for a universal blasphemy law over a decade, revived these attempts. Separately, the Human Rights Commission of the OIC called for "an international code of conduct for media and social media to disallow the dissemination of incitement material". Non-Muslim nations that do not have blasphemy laws, have pointed to abuses of blasphemy laws in Islamic nations, and have disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/radical-islam’s-global-reaction-push-blasphemy-laws Michael Totten, Radical Islam's global reaction: the push for blasphemy laws (January/February 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/19/us-protests-religions-blasphemy-idUSBRE88I1EG20120919|title=Islamic states to reopen quest for global blasphemy law|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/Blasphemy_Cases.pdf|format=PDF|title=Blasphemy Laws Exposed – The Consequences of Criminalizing Defamation of Religions |year=2012|website=humanrightsfirst.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding, controversies raised in the non-Muslim world, especially over depictions of [[Muhammad]], questionning issues relating to the [[religious offense]] to minorities in secular countries. A key case was the 1989 fatwa against English author [[Salman Rushdie]] for his 1988 book entitled ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', the title of which refers to an account that Muhammad, in the course of revealing the Quran, [[Satanic Verses|received a revelation from Satan and incorporated it therein]] until made by Allah to retract it. Several translators of his book into foreign languages have been murdered.&lt;ref name="Rushdie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blasphemy Salman Rushdie |publisher=Constitutional Rights Foundation |year=2009 |url=http://www.crf-usa.org/america-responds-to-terrorism/blasphemy-salman-rushdie.html |accessdate=10 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818052403/http://www.crf-usa.org/america-responds-to-terrorism/blasphemy-salman-rushdie.html |archivedate=18 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, many supporters of Salman Rushdie and his publishers advocated unrestricted freedom of expression and the abolition of the [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom|British blasphemy laws]]. As a response, [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] wrote ''[[A Brief History of Blasphemy]]'' in which he discussed freedom to publish books that may cause distress to minorities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1994, Hadi Al-Mutif a teenager who was a Shi’a Ismaili Muslim from [[Najran]] in southwestern [[Saudi Arabia]], made a remark that a court deemed blasphemous and was sentenced to death for apostasy. {{as of|2010}}, he was still in prison, had alleged physical abuse and mistreatment during his years of incarceration, and had reportedly made numerous suicide attempts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscirf.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3027&amp;Itemid=1 3/25/2010: Saudi Arabia: Release Hadi Al-Mutif], March 25, 2010, United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedomofapostasy.wordpress.com/crimes-against-humanity/ Freedom of Apostasy : The Victims].&lt;/ref&gt;

The court sentenced Ahmad to ten years in prison and six lashes from a rattan cane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Malaysia court sentences Muslim sect leader to 10 years in jail, caning over false teachings |publisher = 3news.co.nz |date = 21 October 2009 |url = http://www.3news.co.nz/Malaysia-court-sentences-Muslim-sect-leader-to-10-years-in-jail-caning-over-false-teachings/tabid/209/articleID/126395/Default.aspx?ArticleID=126395 |accessdate = 15 November 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120905151522/http://www.3news.co.nz/Malaysia-court-sentences-Muslim-sect-leader-to-10-years-in-jail-caning-over-false-teachings/tabid/209/articleID/126395/Default.aspx?ArticleID=126395 |archive-date = 5 September 2012 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, Bangladeshi cartoonist [[Arifur Rahman]] depicted in the daily ''[[Prothom Alo]]'' a boy holding a cat conversing with an elderly man. The man asks the boy his name, and he replies "Babu". The older man chides him for not mentioning the name of Muhammad before his name. He then points to the cat and asks the boy what it is called, and the boy replies "Muhammad the cat". Bangladesh does not have a blasphemy law but groups said the cartoon ridiculed Muhammad, torched copies of the paper and demanded that Rahman be executed for blasphemy. As a result, Bangladeshi police detained Rahman and confiscated copies of ''Prothom Alo'' in which the cartoon appeared.

The [[Asia Bibi blasphemy case]] involved a [[Christianity in Pakistan|Pakistani Christian]] woman, Aasiya Noreen (born {{circa}} 1971;&lt;ref name="kazim"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/0,1518,729847,00.html|title=Eine Ziege, ein Streit und ein Todesurteil|last=Kazim|first=Hasnain|date=19 November 2010|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German|trans-title=A goat, a fight and a death sentence|accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; better known as Asia Bibi&lt;ref name="fears"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11923701|title=Fear for Pakistan's death row Christian woman|last=|first=|date=5 December 2010|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=5 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206045829/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11923701|archivedate=6 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; convicted of [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan|blasphemy by a Pakistani court]], receiving a sentence of death by [[hanging]] in 2010. In June 2009, Noreen was involved in an argument with a group of Muslim women with whom she had been harvesting berries after the other women grew angry with her for drinking the same water as them. She was subsequently accused of insulting the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], a charge she denies, and was arrested and imprisoned. In November 2010, a [[Sheikhupura]] judge sentenced her to death. If executed, Noreen would be the first woman in Pakistan to be lawfully killed for blasphemy.&lt;ref name=aps&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101111/wl_sthasia_afp/pakistanunrestreligionchristian |first=Waqar |last=Hussain |title=Christian Woman Sentenced to Death|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=11 November 2010|accessdate=11 November 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114071047/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101111/wl_sthasia_afp/pakistanunrestreligionchristian| archivedate=14 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/8120142/Christian-woman-sentenced-to-death-in-Pakistan-for-blasphemy.html |first1=Rob |last1=Crilly |first2=Aoun |last2=Sahi |title=Christian Woman sentenced to Death in Pakistan for blasphemy |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=9 November 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2010 |location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101111174909/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/8120142/Christian-woman-sentenced-to-death-in-Pakistan-for-blasphemy.html| archivedate=11 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdict, which was reached in a district court and would need to be upheld by a superior court, has received worldwide attention. Various petitions, including one that received 400,000 signatures, were organized to protest Noreen's imprisonment, and [[Pope Benedict XVI]] publicly called for the charges against her to be dismissed. She received less sympathy from her neighbors and Islamic religious leaders in the country, some of whom adamantly called for her to be executed. Christian minorities minister [[Shahbaz Bhatti]] and Muslim politician [[Salmaan Taseer]] were both assassinated for advocating on her behalf and opposing the blasphemy laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/02/us-pakistan-assassination-idUSTRE7211GH20110302 | work=Reuters | title=Militants say killed Pakistani minister for blasphemy | date=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noreen's family went into hiding after receiving death threats, some of which threatened to kill Asia if released from prison.&lt;ref name=price&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11930849 | title = Pakistani Christian Asia Bibi 'has price on her head' | last = Guerin  | first = Orla |date = 6 December 2010 | work = [[BBC]] | accessdate = 6 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101207044430/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11930849| archivedate= 7 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Governor [[Salmaan Taseer]] and Pakistan's Minority Affairs Minister [[Shahbaz Bhatti]] both publicly supported Noreen, with the latter saying, "I will go to every knock for justice on her behalf and I will take all steps for her protection."&lt;ref name=price/&gt; She also received support from Pakistani political scientist [[Rasul Baksh Rais]] and local priest Samson Dilawar.&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Julie|title=Christian's Death Verdict Spurs Holy Row In Pakistan|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/14/132031645/christian-s-death-verdict-spurs-holy-row-in-pakistan|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=27 November 2013|date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imprisonment of Noreen left Christians and other minorities in Pakistan feeling vulnerable, and [[liberal Muslims]] were also unnerved by her sentencing.&lt;ref name=Ind&gt;{{cite news|title='Salmaan Taseer came here and he sacrificed his life for me'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/salmaan-taseer-came-here-and-he-sacrificed-his-life-for-me-2179170.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=27 November 2012|date=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minority Affairs Minister [[Shahbaz Bhatti]] said that he was first threatened with death in June 2010 when he was told that he would be beheaded if he attempted to change the blasphemy laws. In response, he told reporters that he was "committed to the principle of justice for the people of Pakistan" and willing to die fighting for Noreen's release.&lt;ref name=price/&gt; On 2 March 2011, Bhatti was shot dead by gunmen who ambushed his car near his residence in Islamabad, presumably because of his position on the blasphemy laws.

In January 2011, talking about the Asia Bibi blasphemy case, Pakistani politician Salmaan Taseer expressed views opposing the country's blasphemy law and supporting Asia Bibi. He was then killed by one of his bodyguards, Malik Mumtaz Qadri. After the murder, hundreds of clerics voiced support for the crime and urged a general boycott of Taseer's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;R.

====Protests against depicting Muhammad====
[[File:Maome.jpg|thumb|260px|A 17th century copy of a 14th-century Persian manuscript image of [[Muhammad]] prohibiting [[Nasi']], one of the [[depictions of Muhammad]] which raised objections]]

In December 1999, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' printed on the same page pictures of “moral apostles” Muhammad, [[Jesus]], [[Confucius]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Few weeks later, the magazine received protests, petitions and threats against publishing [[depictions of Muhammad]]. The Turkish TV-station [[Show TV]] broadcast the telephone number of an editor who then received daily calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613871.html Terror am Telefon], ''Spiegel'', February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; A picture of Muhammad had been published by the magazine once before in 1998 in a special edition on Islam, without evoking similar protests.&lt;ref&gt;''Spiegel Special'' 1, 1998, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, several Muslims protested against the inclusion of Muhammad's depictions in the [[English Wikipedia]]'s ''Muhammad'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,328966,00.html |title=Muslims Protest Wikipedia Images of Muhammad |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2008-02-06 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/books/05wiki.html |title=Wikipedia Islam Entry Is Criticized |author=Noam Cohen |publisher=New York Times |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition opposed a reproduction of a 17th-century Ottoman copy of a 14th-century [[Ilkhanate]] manuscript image depicting Muhammad as he prohibited [[Nasīʾ]].&lt;ref&gt;MS Arabe 1489.

====The Muhammad cartoons crisis====
{{Muhammad cartoons}}

In September 2005, in the tense aftermath of the assassination of Dutch film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], killed for his views on Islam, Danish news service [[Ritzau]] published an article discussing the difficulty encountered by the writer [[Kåre Bluitgen]] to find an illustrator to work on his children's book ''The Qur'an and the life of the Prophet Muhammad'' (Danish:''Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv'').&lt;ref name="hansen&amp;hundevadt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=John|title=Provoen og Profeten: Muhammed Krisen bag kulisserne|year=2006|publisher=Jyllands-Postens Forlag|location=Copenhagen|isbn=87-7692-092-5|first2=Kim |last2=Hundevadt|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bluitgen|first=Kåre|title=Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv|year=2006|publisher=Høst &amp; Søn/Tøkk|isbn=978-87-638-0049-5|page=268|url=http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T|others=Anonymous illustrator|language=Danish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118123641/http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T|archivedate=18 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that three artists declined his proposal, which was interpreted as evidence of self-censorship out of fear of reprisals, which led to much debate in Denmark.&lt;ref name="dybangst"&gt;{{cite news|date=17 September 2005|title=Dyb angst for kritik af islam ("Profound anxiety about criticism of Islam")|newspaper=Politiken|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/ECE123660/dyb-angst-for-kritik-af-islam/|accessdate=19 March 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whyipub"&gt;{{cite news|date=19 February 2006|title=Why I Published Those Cartoons |newspaper=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/17/AR2006021702499.html|first=Flemming|last=Rose|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the experiment, Danish scholar [[Peter Hervik]] wrote that it disproved the idea that self-censorship was a serious problem in Denmark, because the overwhelming majority of cartoonists had either responded positively or refused for contractual or philosophical reasons.&lt;ref name=IMER&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hervik|first=Peter|title=The Danish Muhammad Cartoon Conflict|journal=Current Themes in IMER Research|year=2012|volume=13|url=http://www.mah.se/upload/Forskningscentrum/MIM/CT/CT%2013.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2012|publisher=Malmö Institute for Studies of Migration, Diversity and Welfare (MIM)|issn=1652-4616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Danish newspaper ''Politiken'' stated that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists who reportedly declined his proposal, so his claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved, but that Bluitgen refused, making his initial claim impossible to confirm.&lt;ref&gt;Politiken 12. Februar 2006 "''Muhammedsag: Ikke ligefrem en genistreg''"&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Flemming Rose]], an editor at the [[List of newspapers in Denmark|Danish newspaper]] ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'', invited professional illustrators to depict Muhammad as an experiment to see how much they felt threatened. The newspaper announced that this was an attempt to contribute to the debate about [[criticism of Islam]] and self-censorship. On 30 September 2005, the ''Jyllands-Posten'' published 12 editorial cartoons, most of which depicted the prophet Muhammad. One cartoon by [[Kurt Westergaard]] depicted Muhammad with a bomb in his turban, which resulted in the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] (or Muhammad cartoons crisis) ([[Denmark|Danish]]: ''Muhammedkrisen'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henkel|first=Heiko|title=Fundamentally Danish?

"Those who have won are dictatorships in the Middle East, in Saudi Arabia, where they cut criminals' hands and give women no rights," Juste told The Associated Press. "The dark dictatorships have won."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cartoon-inflames-muslim-world/|title=Cartoon Inflames Muslim World|author=LLOYD VRIES|date=2 Feb 2006|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting the cartoon that initiated the diplomatic crisis, American scholar [[John E. Woods (historian)|John Woods]] expressed worries about Westergaard-like association of the Prophet with terrorism, that was beyond satire and offensive to a vast majority of Muslims.&lt;ref name=explaining&gt;{{cite news|title=Explaining the outrage|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-02-08/news/0602080383_1_prophet-muhammad-cartoons-muslims|date=2006-02-08|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hervik also deplored that the newspaper's "desire to provoke and insult Danish Muslims exceeded the wish to test the self-censorship of Danish cartoonists."&lt;ref name=IMER/&gt; 

In Sweden, an online caricature competition was announced in support of ''Jyllands-Posten'', but foreign minister [[Laila Freivalds]] pressured the provider to shut the page down (in 2006, her involvement was revealed to the public and she had to resign).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21470789.htm |title=Swedish foreign minister resigns over cartoons |work=Reuters AlertNet |accessdate=2006-03-21 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060322184626/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21470789.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, satirical magazine ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' republished the ''Jyllands-Posten'' cartoons of Muhammad. It was taken to court by Islamic organisations under [[Hate speech laws in France|French hate speech laws]]; it was ultimately acquitted of charges that it incited hatred.&lt;ref name="Leveque1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leveque|first=Thierry|title=French court clears weekly in Mohammad cartoon row|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/03/22/industry-france-cartoons-trial-dc-idUSL2212067120070322|accessdate=10 June 2013|agency=Reuters|date=22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leveque"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leveque|first=Thierry|title=French court clears weekly in Mohammad cartoon row|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/03/22/industry-france-cartoons-trial-dc-idUSL2212067120070322|accessdate=10 June 2013|publisher=Reuters|date=22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, art galleries in Sweden declined to show drawings of artist [[Lars Vilks]] depicting Muhammad as a [[roundabout dog]]. While Swedish newspapers had published them already, the drawings gained international attention after the newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of them on August 18 to illustrate an editorial on the "right to ridicule a religion".&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=Rätten att förlöjliga en religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190721/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;br/&gt;English translation: {{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=The right to ridicule a religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830163657/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular publication led to official condemnations from Iran,&lt;ref name=iran&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran protests over Swedish Muhammad cartoon |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-08-27 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829141345/http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |archivedate=29 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan,&lt;ref name=pakistan&gt;{{cite press release|title=Pakistan Condemns the Publication of Offensive Sketch in Sweden |publisher=[[Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904154021/http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |archivedate=4 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan,&lt;ref name=afghanistan&gt;{{cite news |first=Sayed |last=Salahuddin |title=Indignant Afghanistan slams Prophet Mohammad sketch |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/SouthAsiaNews/idINIndia-29281220070901 |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt&lt;ref name=egypt&gt;{{cite news |first=Gwladys |last=Fouché |title=Egypt wades into Swedish cartoons row |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,2161595,00.html |publisher=The Guardian |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jordan,&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan condemns new Swedish Mohammed cartoon |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070903/wl_mideast_afp/jordanswedenislam_070903124623 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the inter-governmental Organisation of the Islamic Conference.&lt;ref name=oic&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Secretary General strongly condemned the publishing of blasphemous caricatures of prophet Muhammad by Swedish artist |publisher=[[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012054243/http://oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2007-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the American comedy program ''[[South Park]]'', which had previously depicted Muhammad as a superhero ("[[Super Best Friends]])"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Super Best Friends | episodelink = Super Best Friends | series = South Park | serieslink = South Park | airdate = 2001-07-04 | season = 5 | number = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has depicted Muhammad in the opening sequence since then,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/04/15/south-parks-been-showing-muhammad-all-season/ |title=Ryan j Budke.

They intended to show Muhammad handing a salmon helmet to ''[[Family Guy]]'' character [[Peter Griffin]] ("[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]"). However, [[Comedy Central]] who airs the series rejected the scene and its creators reacted by satirizing [[double standard]] for broadcast acceptability. In April 2010, animators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] planned to make episodes satirizing controversies over previous episodes, including Comedy Central's refusal to show images of Muhammad following the 2005 Danish controversy. After they faced Internet death threats, Comedy Central modified their version of the episode, obscuring all images and bleeping all references to Muhammad. In reaction, cartoonist Molly Norris created the [[Everybody Draw Mohammed Day]], claiming that if many people draw pictures of Muhammad, threats to murder them all would become unrealistic. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Examples of blasphemy==
[[File:Salman-Rushdie-1.jpg|thumb|Writer [[Salman Rushdie]] was accused of blasphemy and became the subject of a ''[[fatwā]]'' issued by [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], in February 1989.]]
A variety of actions, speeches or behavior can constitute blasphemy in Islam. Some examples include insulting or cursing Allah, or Muhammad; mockery or disagreeable behavior towards beliefs and customs common in Islam; criticism of Islam's holy personages. [[Apostasy in Islam|Apostasy]], that is, the act of abandoning Islam, or finding faults or expressing doubts about Allah (''ta'til'') and Qur'an, rejection of Muhammed or any of his teachings, or leaving the Muslim community to become an atheist is a form of blasphemy. Questioning religious opinions (fatwa) and normative Islamic views can also be construed as blasphemous. Improper dress, drawing offensive cartoons, tearing or burning holy literature of Islam, creating or using music or painting or video or novels to mock or criticize Muhammad are some examples of blasphemous acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicp.ca/islamic-lessons/english/youth/the-islamic-education-series-book-5/chapter-of-belief/lesson-13-the-types-of-blasphemy-and-blasphemers/ Association of Islamic Charitable Projects, ''The Types of Blasphemy'' (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawton, D.

Individuals have been accused of blasphemy or of insulting Islam for a variety of actions and words.

'''Land use''' involves the management and modification of [[natural environment]] or [[wilderness]] into [[built environment]] such as [[Human settlement|settlements]] and semi-natural habitats such as [[Arable land|arable fields]], [[pasture]]s, and managed [[Woodland|woods]]. It also has been defined as "the total of arrangements, activities, and inputs that people undertake in a certain [[land cover]] type."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/land_use/045.htm IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change And Forestry, 2.2.1.1 Land Use]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
[[Image:Europe land use map.png|thumb|400px|A land use map of [[Europe]]—major non-natural land uses include arable farmland (yellow) and pasture (light green).]]

Land Use practices vary considerably across the world. The [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] Water Development Division explains that "Land use concerns the products and/or benefits obtained from use of the land as well as the land management actions (activities) carried out by humans to produce those products and benefits."&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090808100750/http://www.fao.org/landandwater/agll/landuse/landusedef.stm FAO Land and Water Division] retrieved 14 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  As of the early 1990s, about 13% of the [[Earth]] was considered arable land, with 26% in pasture, 32% forests and woodland, and 1.5% urban areas.

As Albert Guttenberg (1959) wrote many years ago, "'Land use' is a key term in the language of [[city planning]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a787389941~frm=titlelink JAPA 25:3]&lt;/ref&gt;  Commonly, political [[jurisdiction]]s will undertake [[land-use planning]] and regulate the use of land in an attempt to avoid [[land-use conflict]]s.  Land use plans are implemented through land division and use ordinances and regulations, such as [[zoning regulations]].  [[Management consulting]] firms and [[non-governmental organizations]] will frequently seek to influence these regulations before they are codified.

=== United States ===

In colonial America, few regulations existed to control the use of land, due to the seemingly endless amounts of it. As society shifted from rural to urban, public land regulation became important, especially to city governments trying to control industry, commerce, and housing within their boundaries. The first zoning ordinance was passed in [[New York City]] in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;[[Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nolon, John R., [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1505003 Local Land Use Control in New York: An Aging Citadel Under Siege] (July/Aug. 1992). New York State Bar Journal, p. 38, July–August 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and, by the 1930s, most states had adopted [[zoning]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zoning]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, concerns about the environment and historic preservation led to further regulation.

Today, federal, state, and local governments regulate growth and [[land development|development]] through [[statutory law]]. The majority of controls on land, however, stem from the actions of private developers and individuals. Three typical situations bringing such private entities into the court system are: suits brought by one neighbor against another; suits brought by a public official against a neighboring landowner on behalf of the public; and suits involving individuals who share ownership of a particular parcel of land. In these situations, judicial decisions and enforcement of private land-use arrangements can reinforce public regulation, and achieve forms and levels of control that regulatory zoning cannot.

Two major federal laws have been passed in the last half century that limit the use of land significantly. These are the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]] (today embodied in 16 U.S.C. 461 et seq.) and the [[National Environmental Policy Act of 1969]] (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]] has identified six major types of land use in the US. Acreage statistics for each type of land use in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous 48 states]] in 2017 were as follows:

* [[Pasture]]/[[Rangeland|range]]: 654 M 
* [[Forest]]: 538.6 M
* [[Agricultural land|Cropland]]: 391.5 M
* Special use: 168.8 M
* Miscellaneous: 68.9 M
* [[Urban area|Urban]]: 69.4 M &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/|title=Here's How America Uses Its Land|last=Merrill|first=Dave|date=July 31, 2018|work=Bloomberg|access-date=2018-08-05|last2=Leatherby|first2=Lauren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environment ==
Land use and [[land management]] practices have a major impact on [[natural resources]] including [[water]], [[soil]], [[nutrient]]s, [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ameztegui|first1=Aitor|last2=Coll|first2=Lluis|last3=Brotons|first3=Lluis|last4=Ninot|first4=JM|title=Land-use legacies rather than climate change are driving the recent upward shift of the mountain tree line in the Pyrenees.|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|date=2016|doi=10.1111/geb.12407|url=http://arxiudigital.ctfc.cat/docs/upload/27_520_Ameztegui_et_al-Global_Ecology_and_Biogeography.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land use information can be used to develop solutions for natural resource management issues such as salinity and [[water quality]]. For instance, water bodies in a region that has been [[deforested]] or having erosion will have different water quality than those in areas that are [[forest]]ed. [[Forest gardening]], a plant-based food production system, is believed to be the oldest form of land use in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forest Gardening|author=Robert Hart|year=1996|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N01940btQAQC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Forest gardening, in the sense of finding uses for and attempting to control the growth of wild plants, is undoubtedly the oldest form of land use in the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major effect of land use on [[land cover]] since 1750 has been [[deforestation]] of [[temperate region]]s.{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]&lt;/ref&gt; More recent significant effects of land use include [[urban sprawl]], [[soil erosion]], [[soil degradation]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], and [[desertification]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/ENVIRONMENT/envpdf/landdatafinal.pdf UN Land Degradation and Land Use/Cover Data Sources] ret. 26 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Land-use change, together with use of [[fossil fuel]]s, are the major [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] sources of carbon dioxide, a dominant [[greenhouse gas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf UN Report on Climate Change] retrieved 25 June 2007 from Web archive [https://web.archive.org/web/19960101/http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], land degradation has been exacerbated where there has been an absence of any land use planning, or of its orderly execution, or the existence of financial or legal incentives that have led to the wrong land use decisions, or one-sided central planning leading to over-utilization of the land resources - for instance for immediate production at all costs. As a consequence the result has often been misery for large segments of the local population and destruction of valuable [[ecosystem]]s. Such narrow approaches should be replaced by a technique for the planning and management of land resources that is integrated and holistic and where land users are central. This will ensure the long-term quality of the land for human use, the prevention or resolution of social conflicts related to land use, and the conservation of [[ecosystems]] of high [[biodiversity]] value.

== Urban growth boundaries ==

The [[urban growth boundary]] is one form of land-use regulation. For example, [[Portland, Oregon]] is required to have an urban growth boundary which contains at least {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} of vacant land. Additionally, Oregon restricts the development of farmland. The regulations are controversial, but an economic analysis concluded that farmland appreciated similarly to the other land.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeker WG, Plantinga AJ (2007).

The '''Master of Economics''' is  a [[postgraduate]] '''[[master's degree]] in [[economics]]''' ('''M.Econ.''', '''M.Ec.'''; also [[Master of Science|MS]] in Economics, [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Economics, [[Master of Commerce|MCom]] in Economics) comprising training in economic theory, [[econometrics]] and / or [[applied economics]].

==Overview==
The degree may be offered as a [[terminal degree]] or as additional preparation for [[doctorate|doctoral study]], and is sometimes offered as a [[professional degree]], such as the  emerging  degree, ''M.P.S. in Applied Economics''. The program emphases and curricula will differ correspondingly.  The course of study for the master's degree lasts from one to two years. A [[thesis]] is often required, particularly for terminal degrees.

Many universities (in the United States) do not offer the master's degree directly; rather, the degree is routinely awarded as a [[Doctor of Philosophy#Master's degree "en route"|master's degree "en route"]], after completion of a designated phase of the [[Ph.D.]] program in economics. 

Typically, the [[curriculum]] is structured around [[Core curriculum|core topics]], with any optional [[coursework]] [[wikt:complementary|complementary]] to the program focus. The core modules are usually in [[Microeconomics|microeconomic theory]], [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic theory]] and [[econometrics]]. Theory-focused degrees will tend to cover these more mathematically, and emphasize econometric theory as opposed to econometric techniques and [[Statistical packages|software]]; these will also require a separate course in [[mathematical economics]]. Note though that regardless of focus, most programs "now place a marked emphasis on the primacy of mathematics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Masters degrees in economics: How to be a leader of the future|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/postgraduate/masters-degrees-in-economics-how-to-be-a-leader-of-the-future-482394.html|newspaper=The Independent | location=London|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many universities thus also require [[Business_mathematics#Postgraduate|"quantitative techniques"]], especially where mathematical economics is not a core course. Some (doctoral) programs include core work in [[economic history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Econ Grad School|url=http://www.davidson.edu/academic/economics/foley/gradschool.htm|publisher=Davidson|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528031938/http://www.davidson.edu/academic/economics/foley/gradschool.htm|archivedate=2010-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The optional or additional coursework will depend on the program's emphasis. In theory-focused degrees, and those preparing students for doctoral work, this coursework is often in these same core topics, but in greater depth. In terminal or applied or [[Professional degree|career-focused degrees]], options may include [[public finance]], [[labour economics|labour-]], [[financial economics|financial-]], [[development economics|development-]], [[industrial economics|industrial-]],  [[health economics|health-]] or [[agricultural economics]]. These degrees may also allow for a specialization in one of these areas, and may be named correspondingly (for example [[Master's in Financial Economics]], [[Masters in International Economics]], [[Masters in Development Economics]], Master's in Sustainable Economic Development and [[Masters in Agricultural Economics]].)

Entry requirements are undergraduate work in (calculus-based) economics, at least at the intermediate level, and often as a [[academic major|major]], and a sufficient level of mathematical training (including courses in  [[probability]] and [[statistics]]; often ([[Multivariable calculus|multivariable]]) [[calculus]] and [[linear algebra]]; and sometimes [[mathematical analysis]].)

The term '''mutual shaping''' was developed through [[Science and Technology Studies]] (STS) in an attempt to explain the detailed process of technological design.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual shaping is a combination of [[social determinism]] and [[technological determinism]], suggesting that society and technology are not mutually exclusive to one another and, instead, influence and shape each other.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison of TD and SD ==
[[Technological determinism]] (TD), coined by [[Thorstein Veblen]], suggests that technology is the primary catalyst for change in society. Following this theory, the development and implementation of technology is beyond the control of society as it is pervasive in all elements of our lives. Once a technology has been created its influence on society is an inevitable, predetermined path. An example that supports technological determinism is the development of the [[printing press]] that accelerated the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, L. (2010). Technological determinism. In S. Priest (Ed.), Encyclopedia of science and technology communication. (pp. 870-873). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. {{DOI|10.4135/9781412959216.n293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, social determinism (SD), popularized by social theorists [[Karl Marx]] and [[Emile Durkheim]], purports that social structure is the driving factor towards change in society.&lt;ref&gt;Determinism. (2001). In World of sociology, Gale. Retrieved from http://esearch.credoreference.com/content/entry/worldsocs/determinism/0&lt;/ref&gt; Following this view, society is the governing force that determines social behaviour, and technology is created and adapted based on society’s wants and needs.&lt;ref&gt;Mahood, Aurelea. (2008). Social and technological determinism. CultureNet @ CapilanoU. Retrieved from http://culturenet.wordpress.com/2008/03/07/social-and-technological-determinism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Both TD and SD are cause-and-effect theories suggesting that technology and society are mutually exclusive. The theory of mutual shaping suggests that technology design is a result of a synthesis of TD and SD. It sees technology and society working together to facilitate change. Society changes as a direct result of the implementation of technology that has been created based on society’s wants and needs. They function collectively to shape one another.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In social networks ==
Mutual shaping is exemplified through the integration of online [[Social networking|social networking platforms]] into daily life. They are a [[communications technology]] designed to complement pre-existing methods of communication, such as the phone or in-person conversations, that have become more convenient and/or affordable than their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = B. | last2 = Quan-Haase | first2 = A. | last3 = Witte | first3 = J. | last4 = Hampton | first4 = K. | year = 2013 | title = Does the internet increase, decrease, or supplement social capital?: Social networks, participation, and community commitment | url = | journal = American Behavioral Scientist| volume =  45| issue = | pages =  436–455 [440] | doi = 10.1177/00027640121957286 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TD would argue that these communication technologies have directly influenced our networking capabilities due to their accessibility. Without them we would not be able to conduct business or maintain friendships over long distances. SD would argue that these platforms were created as a result of a need to facilitate communication over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual shaping supports both of these arguments, believing that the two cannot be separated. Social networking platforms display how technology and society are inextricably linked as they work together towards the advancement of one another, exemplifying the theory of mutual shaping.

The '''Nun Study of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease''' is a continuing [[longitudinal study]], begun in 1986, to examine the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. [[David Snowdon]], the founding Nun Study investigator, began the research at the [[University of Minnesota]], but moved it to the [[University of Kentucky]] in 1986. In 2008, with Snowdon's retirement, the study returned to the University of Minnesota. Similar environmental influences and general lifestyles among the participants make the nuns an ideal population to study, and although it is ongoing it has yielded several findings. At the University of Minnesota, Kelvin Lim and Laura Hemmy are developing a new Alzheimer's Disease study working with the [[School Sisters of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;''Trust &amp; Dare'', newsletter of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1992, researchers at [[Rush University Medical Center]] [[Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center]] (RADC), building on the success of the Nun Study, proposed the [[Rush Religious Orders Study]]. The Religious Orders Study was funded by the [[National Institute on Aging]] in 1993, and is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;Overview and Findings from the Religious Orders Study, Curr Alzheimer Res. 2012 July 1:9(6): 628-645.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the University of Minnesota are collaborating with the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center on the Religious Orders Study, as well as several other ongoing studies.&lt;ref&gt;Trust &amp; Dare, newsletter of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Nun Study, begun in 1986 with funding by the National Institute on Aging, focuses on a group of 678 American [[Roman Catholic]] sisters who are members of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. Studying a relatively homogeneous group (no drug use, little or no alcohol, similar housing and reproductive histories, etc.) minimizes the extraneous [[variable (research)|variable]]s that may confound other similar research.

==Current findings==
Researchers have also accessed the convent archive to review documents amassed throughout the lives of the nuns in the study. Among the documents reviewed were autobiographical essays that had been written by the nuns upon joining the sisterhood; upon review, it was found that an essay's lack of linguistic density (e.g., complexity, vivacity, fluency) functioned as a [[statistical significance|significant]] predictor of its author's risk for developing Alzheimer's disease in old age. The approximate mean age of the nuns at the time of writing was merely 22 years. Roughly 80% of nuns whose writing was measured as lacking in linguistic density went on to develop Alzheimer's disease in old age; meanwhile, of those whose writing was not lacking, only 10% later developed the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Riley KP, Snowdon DA, Desrosiers MF, Markesbery WR: Early life linguistic ability, late life cognitive function, and neuropathology: Findings from the Nun Study Neurobiology of Aging 26(3):341347, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, findings of the Nun Study suggest "that traits in early, mid, and late life have strong relationships with the risk of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the [[mental  disabilities|mental]] and [[cognitive disabilities]] of old age."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthstudies.umn.edu/nunstudy/faq.jsp The University of Minnesota's Nun Study FAQ page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512190448/http://www.healthstudies.umn.edu/nunstudy/faq.jsp |date=2010-05-12 }}, December 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2559">'''Organography''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|όργανο}}, ''organo'', "[[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]"; and {{lang|grc|-γραφή}}, ''[[wiktionary:-graphy|-graphy]]'') is the scientific description of the structure and function of the organs of living things.

==History==
Organography as a scientific study starts with Aristotle, who considered the parts of plants as "organs" and began to consider the relationship between different organs and different functions. In the 17th century Joachim Jung,&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Jung, Isagoge phytoscopica (1678)&lt;/ref&gt; clearly articulated that plants are composed of different organ types such as root, stem and leaf, and he went on to define these organ types on the basis of form and position.

In the following century Caspar Friedrich Wolff &lt;ref&gt;Caspar Friedrich Wolff, Theoria generationis (1759)&lt;/ref&gt; was able to follow the development of organs from the "growing points" or apical meristems. He noted the commonality of development between foliage leaves and floral leaves (e.g. petals) and wrote: "In the whole plant, whose parts we wonder at as being, at the first glance, so extraordinarily diverse, I finally perceive and recognize nothing beyond leaves and stem (for the root may be regarded as a stem). Consequently all parts of the plant, except the stem, are modified leaves."

Similar views were propounded at by Goethe in his well-known treatise.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Goethe, Versuch die Metamorphose der Pflanzen zu erklaren (1790)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "The underlying relationship between the various external parts of the plant, such as the leaves, the calyx, the corolla, the stamens, which develop one after the other and, as it were, out of one another, has long been generally recognized by investigators, and has in fact been specially studied; and the operation by which one and the same organ presents itself to us in various forms has been termed Metamorphosis of Plants."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5362">'''Overwintering''' is the process by which some [[organism]]s pass through or wait out the winter season, or  pass through that period of the year when "winter" conditions (cold or sub-zero [[temperatures]], [[ice]], [[snow]], limited food supplies) make normal activity or even survival difficult or near impossible. In some cases "winter" is characterized not necessarily by cold but by dry conditions; passing through such periods could likewise be called overwintering.

[[Hibernation]] and [[Animal migration|migration]] are the two major ways in which overwintering is accomplished.

Overwintering occurs in several classes of lifeform:

* In [[entomology]], overwintering is how an [[insect]] passes the winter season. Many insects overwinter as adults, [[pupae]], or eggs. This can be done inside buildings, under tree bark, or beneath fallen leaves or other plant matter on the ground, among other places. All such overwintering sites shield the insect from adverse conditions associated with winter. Activity almost completely ceases until conditions become more favourable. One example is the [[Nymphalis antiopa|mourning cloak butterfly]], which experiences advantages to overwintering in their desired locations by being one of the first butterflies to emerge after a cold winter.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa, Fonesca. "Nymphalis antiopa". Animal Diversity Web. University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. Retrieved 4 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example are the eggs of the [[forest tent caterpillar moth]] which overwinter tightly packed on tree branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trudeau|first=M. |author2=Y. Mauffette |author3=S. Rochefort |author4=E. Han |author5=E.Bauce|title=Impact of Host Tree on Forest Tent Caterpillar Performance and Offspring Overwintering Mortality|journal=Environ. Entomol.|year=2010|volume=39|issue=2|pages=498–504|doi=10.1603/EN09139 |pmid=20388280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other insects, such as the [[monarch butterfly]], migrate and overwinter in warmer areas. Additionally, the [[ghost moth]] overwinters as a larva. The [[Gonepteryx rhamni|common brimstone]], found across a broad geographic range, overwinters for 7 months to wait for the development of their larval host plants.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, E.; Hall, M. L.

* Many [[bird]]s migrate and then overwinter in regions where temperatures are warmer or food is more readily available.
* [[Plant]]s are sometimes said to overwinter. At such times, growth of vegetative tissues and reproductive structures becomes minimal or ceases completely. For plants, overwintering often involves restricted water supplies and reduced light exposure. In the spring following overwintering many plants will enter their flowering stage.
* People are also described from time to time as overwintering. This was especially true in the past during the exploration of the planet when people had to pass the winter in places not ideally suited for winter survival, and even today in the [[polar region]]s. Today people may be said to overwinter when they temporarily move to warmer areas during the months of prevailing cold weather in northern latitudes, such as people from various parts of North America staying in [[Florida]], Arizona, or New Mexico (among other places) for parts of November to March.
*In [[plant pathology]], overwintering is where a plant pathogen survives the winter, during which its normal [[crop]] [[Host (biology)|host]] species is not growing, by transferring to an alternative host, living freely in the soil or surviving on plant refuse such as discarded potatoes.

A [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] [[codec]] is a type of audio coder-decoder (codec) that uses digital signal processing to transmit audio digitally over standard telephone lines ("Plain Old Telephone Service") at a higher level of audio quality than the telephone line would normally provide in its analog mode. The POTS codec is one of a family of broadcast codecs differentiated by the type of telecommunications circuit used for transmission. The '''ISDN codec''', which instead uses [[ISDN]] lines, and the IP codec which uses private or public IP networks are also common.

Primarily used in [[broadcast engineering]] to link remote broadcast locations to the host studio, a [[computer hardware|hardware]] [[codec]], implemented with [[digital signal processing]], is used to [[audio data compression|compress the audio data]] enough to travel through a pair of a 33.6k modems.

POTS codecs have the disadvantages of being restricted to relatively low bit rates and being susceptible to variable line quality. ISDN and IP codecs have the advantage of being natively [[Digital data|digital]], and operate at much higher bitrates, which results in fewer [[compression artifact]]s. Special lines must be run to a location, however, and must be ordered well in advance of the event so that there is ample time for installation of equipment.  Since POTS lines are almost universally available, the POTS codec can be set up nearly anywhere with little or no notice.

==Uses==
The main use of a broadcast codec is for [[remote broadcast]]ing by [[Radio broadcasting|radio stations]].

==Functions==
Codecs usually come in two types of units: [[rackmount]] for the [[studio]] and [[wikt:portable|portable]] for the remote.  Audio can be sent in either direction, and most can also pass low-speed non-audio data, allowing the remote [[DJ]] to control [[broadcast automation]] or other studio equipment via [[RS-232]].  Many have an [[automatic redial]] if the line should become disconnected.  The remote unit usually has some basic [[mixing console|mixer]] functions, while the studio unit usually has some kind of digital output.

Some codecs can be configured to use ISDN, POTS or IP rather than requiring a different device for each network, while others are exclusively designed for POTS operation. ISDN and IP connections implement algorithms like [[G.722]], [[MPEG]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[aacPlus]], [[Apt-X]] and [[AAC-LD]] (low-[[Lag|delay]]), while POTS connections almost always use proprietary low bit rate algorithms. Consequently, while ISDN connections can usually be established between codecs from different manufacturers, POTS connections (and usually IP connections) can only be established between codecs from the same family. Some codecs can use [[GSM]] networks, and some have [[variable bitrate]] to [[compensation (engineering)|compensate]] for poor connections.  It is sometimes possible to bond two POTS lines together for [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] and [[fault tolerance]], and improved [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]].

Codecs are made by [[Comrex]], [[Sonifex]], [[Tieline]], APT, [[Telos Systems|Telos]] and [[Prodys]]  among others.

[[Image:PRIO.JPG|thumb|The Peace Research Institute Oslo]]
The '''Peace Research Institute Oslo''' ({{lang-no|Institutt for fredsforskning}}; '''PRIO''') is an independent [[peace and conflict studies]] research institution, based in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It is regarded as the world's "oldest and most prominent peace research center."&lt;ref&gt;David P. Barash,Charles P. Webel, ''Peace and Conflict Studies'', p. 26, SAGE Publications, 2013, {{ISBN|1483315827}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1959 by a group of Norwegian researchers led by [[Johan Galtung]], the principal founder of peace and conflict studies, who was the institute's first director. The ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'', the discipline's preeminent journal, is also published by the institute.

The institute is mainly funded by the [[Research Council of Norway]] and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], and also receives funding from the [[Ministry of Defence (Norway)|Ministry of Defence]], various international organisations such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[European Union]], and private foundations. The institute has around 75 employees. PRIO headquarters are located in central Oslo, next to the headquarters of the [[Norwegian Red Cross]].

==History and governance==
[[File:Johan Galtung - Trento.JPG|thumb|[[Johan Galtung]], PRIO's founder and first director, is regarded as the principal founder of [[peace and conflict studies]], and coined the term [[peacebuilding]]]]

PRIO was founded in 1959 by a group of Norwegian researchers led by [[Johan Galtung]]. The institute originally was a department of the [[Norwegian Institute for Social Research]] in Oslo and became an independent institute in 1966. It was one of the first centres of peace research in the world, and it is Norway’s only peace research institute.&lt;ref name=Forr &gt;Forr, Gudleiv. (2009). ''Strid og fred. Fredsforskning i 50 år: PRIO 1959-2009''. Oslo: Pax&lt;/ref&gt; The institute's director since 2009 is [[Kristian Berg Harpviken]], with [[Inger Skjelsbæk]] as deputy director. Since 2005, the institute has been located in the former gas works building in central Oslo.

PRIO is an independent foundation, governed by a seven-member board. The board includes two PRIO employees, two members appointed by the [[Research Council of Norway]], one member appointed by the Institute for Social Research, one by the [[University of Oslo]], and one by the [[Nordic International Studies Association]].&lt;ref name=statutes &gt;[http://www.prio.no/Global/upload/About%20Prio/PRIO-Statutes-2010.pdf PRIO statutes] (2010), Retrieved 13 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous PRIO directors are, chronologically, [[Johan Galtung]] (1959–69), [[Asbjørn Eide]] (1970, 1980–81), [[Helge Hveem]] (1971), [[Nils Petter Gleditsch]] (1972, 1977–78), [[Kjell Skjelsbæk]] (1973–74), [[Ole Kristian Holthe]] (1975–76), [[Tord Høivik]] (1979–80, 1984–86), [[Marek Thee]] (1981–83), [[Sverre Lodgaard]] (1986–92), [[Hilde Henriksen Waage]] (const., 1992–93), [[Dan Smith (British author)|Dan Smith]] (1993–2001), [[Stein Tønnesson]] (2001–09), [[Kristian Berg Harpviken]] (2009-2017), and [[Henrik Urdal]] (2017-present). After Galtung's resignation in 1969, the institute staff elected a leader for one year at a time. In 1986 this was changed to a three-year period, and again in 1993 to a maximum of two consecutive four-year periods.&lt;ref name=Forr /&gt;

PRIOs first chairman of the board was [[Erik Rinde]] (1966–79), director of [[Institute for Social Research]]. He was succeeded by [[Torstein Eckhoff]] (1979–1986), [[Bernt Bull]] (1987–94), [[Frida Nokken]] (1995-2000), [[Helge Pharo]] (2000–2003), [[Øyvind Østerud]] (2004–06), [[Bernt Aardal]] (2007–2016) and [[Åslaug Marie Haga]] (2016 - present).&lt;ref name=Forr /&gt;

== Research ==
The institute's purpose, as formulated in the statutes, is "to engage in research concerning the conditions for peaceful relations between nations, groups and individuals".&lt;ref name=statutes /&gt; Researchers come from a variety of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities, including [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], [[human geography]], [[history]], [[history of religion]], and [[philosophy]]. Output from the research is primarily published as articles in [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journals]], anthologies or monographs, but also as more policy-oriented reports and papers such as PRIO's in-house series.

Approximately 15 percent of the institute's budget is made up of a core grant from the Research Council of Norway, and the remaining 85 per cent is funded on project basis.&lt;ref&gt;"Income Statement", in [http://www.prio.no/Global/upload/About%20Prio/Annual%20Reports/PRIO%20Annual%20Report%202011.pdf PRIO Annual Report 2011] (retrieved 13 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The two largest project funders are the Research Council of Norway and the [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. Other funders include the [[European Union]], the [[World Bank]], and the [[Norwegian Ministry of Defence]]. In 2009, PRIO initiated the founding of the US based Peace Research Endowment.

In Oslo, PRIO hosts the Norwegian Initiative on Small Arms Transfers. This is a joint initiative of PRIO, the [[Norwegian Red Cross]] and the [[Norwegian Church Aid]] to help block the spread of [[small arms]] to areas where they are likely to be used in warfare, armed violence or human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;Ole-Petter Sunde (1999), [http://www.geneva-forum.org/Reports/salw_vol1/19990505.pdf "The Norwegian Initiative on Small Arms Transfers: West Africa and Beyond"], in ''The Geneva Forum. Seminars on Small Arms (Volume 1)'', Geneva: The Geneva Forum (retrieved 13 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff comprises a core group of 40-50 full-time researchers and support staff. In addition, there are researchers with a part-time affiliation with PRIO, visiting scholars, interns and students. PRIO cooperates with the [[Australian National University]] and the [[University of Stellenbosch]] in offering master programmes in international studies.

===Research centres===

====Centre for the Study of Civil War====
From 2003 to 2012, PRIO hosted the Centre for the Study of Civil War, one of the original 13 "Centres of Excellence" in Norway. The director for the full 10-year period was [[Scott Gates (academic)|Scott Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lund &amp; Else Lie (2012), [http://www.forskningsradet.no/en/Newsarticle/Supplying_tools_to_counteract_civil_war/1253981751008 "Supplying tools to counteract civil war"], Research Council of Norway website (retrieved 13 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyprus Centre====
The institute maintains a centre in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]], known as the PRIO Cyprus Centre. Through its network, projects and dialogue forums, the PRIO Cyprus Centre aims to foster cooperation between [[Greek Cypriots|Greek]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]] and strengthen regional cooperation in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] at large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyprus.prio.org/ PRIO Cyprus Centre website], Retrieved 13 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journals==
PRIO owns two academic journals, both edited at the institute and published by [[SAGE Publications]]: ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'', edited by [[Henrik Urdal]] and ''[[Security Dialogue]]'', edited by [[Mark B. Salter]].

==PRIO Annual Peace Address==
Initiated in 2010, the PRIO Annual Peace Address intends to create awareness, stir public debate and increase understanding about the conditions for peace in the world. Inviting researchers and other people with strong views on peace-related topics, the idea is to challenge the peace research community by suggesting new measures and bringing new perspectives on peace and war.

There are variations in the perception and display of sexual suggestiveness, including but not limited to gender, culture and generation. Different cultures and different generations have varying views on what is considered to be sexually suggestive. For example, in British culture, it is normal for a woman to wear shorts and bare her legs on a hot, sunny day, but a woman with naked flesh on show would be considered [[promiscuous]] in certain cultures around the world. For the majority of the 20th century in western culture, it was considered vulgar for women to have their sexual ornaments ([[breasts]]) fully on show; in more modern times, this may not be a deviation from the norm. In [[evolution]]ary terms, sexual suggestiveness is a mode from which sexual mates are gained. Therefore, the ability to use sexual suggestiveness effectively is a trait that is part of [[sexual selection]].

Displays of sexual suggestiveness include things such as; women in swimsuit adverts, sexually-themed music or music with a strong beat meant for dancing, [[sexting]], erotic [[lingerie]] or "[[wolf whistling]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Research Council |url=http://www.nap.edu/netsafekids/pp_whatis.html |title=What Is Pornography? |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christian.org.uk/news/sexually-suggestive-ms-bus-advert-banned/ |title=Sexually suggestive M&amp;S bus advert banned &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; The Christian Institute |publisher=Christian.org.uk |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crisisinterventioncenter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisisinterventioncenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=147:what-is-sexting&amp;catid=39:teens&amp;Itemid=79|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126151309/http://www.crisisinterventioncenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=147:what-is-sexting&amp;catid=39:teens&amp;Itemid=79 |archive-date=2012-01-26 |dead-url=yes|title=What is Sexting|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= |title=Brain Potentials to Sexually Suggestive Whistles Show Meaning Modulates the Mismatch Negativity |journal=NeuroReport |volume=16 |issue=12 |pages=1313–1317 |pmc=1361366  |date=2013-03-25 |author1=Frangos |first1=J |last2=Ritter |first2=W |last3=Friedman |first3=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HHQDbNk0v94C&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Popular Music: The rock era - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07|isbn=9780415332682 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual suggestiveness may also involve nudity, or the exposure of the nipples, genitals, buttocks or other [[taboo]] areas of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingcharts.com/interactive/one-in-five-teens-sends-sexually-explicit-images-7416/ |title=One in Five Teens Sends Sexually Explicit Images |publisher=Marketingcharts.com |date=2009-01-06 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ESeO4E-ffKsC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Family Life Education: Principles and Practices for Effective Outreach - Stephen F.

In some cases, displays of sexual suggestiveness may be misinterpreted which may lead to dangerous or harmful situations.

==Evolutionary perspective==

From an evolutionary point of view, sexual suggestiveness evolved in order to aid in securing a [[sexual partner]] or mate. Once the individual has decided on a mate to pursue, sexual suggestiveness helps in attracting the mate - this is a skill which has been sexually selected ([[sexual selection]]) for during evolution. Sexually suggestive behaviors include things such as "showing more skin" and [[flirting]]. Both of these examples are behaviors which the individual would intentionally display. There is also research to suggest that sexually suggestive behaviors may not always be deliberate.&lt;ref&gt;Haselton, M. G., Mortezaie, M., Pillsworth, E. G., Bleske-Rechek, A., &amp; Frederick, D. A. (2007). Ovulatory shifts in human female ornamentation: Near ovulation, women dress to impress. Hormones and Behavior, 51, 40 – 45&lt;/ref&gt; Unbeknownst to the individual, factors such as the [[menstrual cycle]], voice pitch and rate of money spending can all have an effect on sexual success and sexually suggestive behavior. For example, when females were in the work place and [[ovulation|ovulating]] they were more likely to engage in sexually suggestive behaviors e.g. showing more skin; further, females who work as lap dancers earn more money when they are in the ovulating stage. This may be because the female unwittingly behaves in a more sexual way and therefore puts out more sexually suggestive cues.&lt;ref name="Frederick, D. A. 2010"&gt;Gallup Jr, G. G., &amp; Frederick, D. A. (2010). The science of sex appeal: An evolutionary perspective. Review of General Psychology, 14(3), 240.&lt;/ref&gt; There is not, however, any evidence to show that these females are aware that their actions or earnings are intrinsically linked to their [[menstrual cycle]].

The rise of the media, advertising and film industries as well as the growth of the fashion industry are all contributing factors to increase sexually suggestive content in an every-day setting. There are far more displays of sexually suggestive  behavior in modern-day life than there ever has been before and not just within advertising. The idea that [[sex sells]] is evident in many aspects of daily modern life particularly within social media and film where [[female sexual ornaments]] are a focal point. For example, many films include additional sex scenes and sexually suggestive female characters regardless of the film’s narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Benshoff, H. M., &amp; Griffin, S. (2011). America on film: Representing race, class, gender, and sexuality at the movies. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, D. H. (1986). Causes of sexual dysfunction: The role of anxiety and cognitive interference. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 54(2), 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The progression of the Internet and social media means that sexual content is far more available and accessible in the 21st century than ever before. This has a knock on effect on people’s [[sexualization]] and [[sexual behavior]]. Children’s sexuality develops at an earlier age if they have been exposed to more sexual content when young. For example, young adolescents engage in more sexual behaviors if they have been exposed to more sexual content in the media or on television.&lt;ref&gt;Lenhart, A. (2009). Teens and Sexting: How and why minor teens are sending sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude images via text messaging.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strasburger, V. C. (1995). Adolescents and the media: medical and psychological impact. Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; On average, females become [[puberty|pubescent]] earlier in their development if they have been exposed to sexual content or sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. M., &amp; Rivadeneyra, R. (1999). Contributions of entertainment television to adolescents’ sexual attitudes and expectations: The role of viewing amount versus viewer involvement. Journal of Sex Research, 36(3), 237-249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D. (2002). Mass media influences on sexuality. Journal of Sex Research, 39(1), 42-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Most psychologists agree that this physical display of sexuality is due to evolutionary reasons and that girls develop their sexuality (e.g. behaving sexually suggestively) at an earlier age in order to [[sexual competition|sexually compete]] with other women and in order [[reproductive success|successfully reproduce]].&lt;ref&gt;Malamuth, N. M. (1996). Sexually explicit media, gender differences, and evolutionary theory. Journal of Communication, 46(3), 8-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. J., &amp; Scott, C. L. (Eds.) (2002). Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research. New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misinterpretation==

The increase in sexual content in modern society often results in a more nonchalant approach to sexually suggestive behavior.  People, predominantly women, often act in a way that they themselves do not consider to be sexually suggestive but which can be misinterpreted by others.&lt;ref&gt;Stockdale, M. S. (1993). The Role of Sexual Misperceptions of Women′ s Friendliness in an Emerging Theory of Sexual Harassment. Journal of Vocational Behavior, 42(1), 84-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Synovitz, L. B., &amp; Byrne, T. J. (1998). Antecedents of sexual victimization: Factors discriminating victims from non-victims. Journal of American College Health, 46(4), 151-158.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, wearing clothes or skirts/shorts that show skin is not something that most Western women would consider to be overtly provocative but it is still regarded as sexually suggestive by others. Misconstruing people’s behaviour can have disastrous consequences, contributing to [[harassment]] and [[rape culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Thornhill, N. W. (1983). Human rape: An evolutionary analysis. Ethology and Sociobiology, 4(3), 137-173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koukounas, E., &amp; Letch, N. M. (2001). Psychological correlates of perception of sexual intent in women. The Journal of social psychology, 141(4), 443-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology]] explains that this misinterpretation is the result of [[sexual selection]]. Men have adapted through sexual selection to have the maximum number of offspring possible, and therefore exhibit certain behaviors that facilitate maximum reproduction. Men perceive sexually suggestive behavior and other sexual cues, including [[biological ornament]]s, as signs of reproductive ability and willingness.&lt;ref&gt;Clutton-Brock, T. (2007). Sexual selection in males and females. Science, 318(5858), 1882-1885.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hypothesis]] of [[rape]] as an [[adaption]] states that the rape of reproductive-age females was favoured by [[directional selection|direct selection]] in order to increase the chance of [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2001). A Natural History of Rape. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, C. T. (1991). Human rape: Adaptation or by‐product?. Journal of Sex Research, 28(3), 365-386.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexually suggestive behavior and biological ornamentation are signs of [[sexual maturity]] and thus females who display more of these behaviors, or who have more obvious ornamentation, are more likely to be at a higher risk of harassment, or even rape.&lt;ref&gt;McKibbin, W. F., Shackelford, T. K., Goetz, A. T., &amp; Starratt, V. G. (2008). Why do men rape? An evolutionary psychological perspective. Review of General Psychology, 12(1), 86.&lt;/ref&gt; This evolutionary explanation also extends to women. At their most fertile stage in their [[menstrual cycle]], during [[estrus]], women are far less likely to engage in rape-risky behaviors such as walking alone late at night, than women who are in the least fertile stage of their menstrual cycle, the [[menstrual cycle|luteal phase]] or women using [[hormonal contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;Chavanne, T. J., &amp; Gallup, G. G. (1998). Variation in risk taking behavior among female college students as a function of the menstrual cycle. Evolution and Human Behavior, 19(1), 27-32.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because women who are in the luteal phase or women using a hormonal contraceptive are much less likely to become pregnant after sexual intercourse than estrus women are.&lt;ref&gt;Gangestad, S. W., &amp; Thornhill, R. (2008). Human oestrus. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences, 275(1638), 991-1000.&lt;/ref&gt;

These evolutionary explanations serve only to increase the psychological understanding of sexual behaviors. Sexual suggestiveness, rape, and all other sexual behaviors, are proven to be products of past evolution. In the case of rape, however, just because it is natural does not make it acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2000). A Natural History of Rape. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R. (1998). Biology of Human Rape, The. Jurimetrics, 39, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2002). Rape and evolution: a reply to our critics. Psychology, Evolution &amp; Gender, 4(3), 283-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flirting ==
[[Flirting]] can be sexually suggestive, which can intentionally elicit a [[sexual arousal|sexual response]] from another person.&lt;ref name=Henni2004 /&gt; Research has identified different motivations for engaging in flirting behaviors. There is flirting with a sexual motivation, which is done with a view to engaging in [[sexual behavior|Human sexual activity]] and there is also flirting with a fun motivation, in which the interaction itself is the pleasurable part.&lt;ref name=Henni2004 /&gt; An instrumental motivation of flirting behavior is flirting performed in order to accomplish an instrumental goal, such as getting someone to buy you a drink. However, flirting can sometimes lead to unintentional responses. If the motivation behind sexually suggestive behavior is misinterpreted or miscommunicated, then a sexual response could be elicited where it is not wanted. If escalated, this can lead to [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace or sexual coercion in a relationship.&lt;ref name=Rich1999 /&gt; In line with evolutionary explanations of sexually suggestive behavior, research has shown that females are more likely to consider the use of flirting as being for relational purposes, and males are more likely to interpret female flirting as having a sexual motivation.&lt;ref name=Henni2004&gt;Henningsen, D. D. (2004). Flirting with Meaning: An Examination of Miscommunication in Flirting Interactions, Sex Roles, 50, (7), pp 481-489&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rich1999&gt;Richman, J. A., et al. (1999) Sexual Harassment and Generalized Workplace Abuse Among University Employees: Prevalence and Mental Health Correlates. ''Journal of American Health'', 89, (3), pp358-363&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences==

There are some reported gender differences between how sexual suggestiveness is perceived. Males and females have different thresholds for the perception of sexual suggestiveness or intent. Males are, in general, more sexually occupied than females. To support this assumption research shows that males perceive people as more interested in a sexual encounter than females do.&lt;ref&gt;Shotland, R. L., &amp; Craig, J. M. (1988). Can men and women differentiate between friendly and sexually interested behavior?. Social Psychology Quarterly, 66-73.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that males find it difficult to differentiate between [[Like#As a verb|liking]], [[love]] and sexual intent, and in this case sexual suggestiveness. Unfortunately, this difficulty in separation between the two from the male’s point of view may lead to rape or other [[sexual assault]]. During the evolution of [[human sexuality]], the fact that females are the choosy gender meant that males who were able to quickly detect a female's willingness were the males who passed along their [[genes]] effectively. In light of this, males, therefore, tend to read sexual acceptance signals in friendly actions even when this may not be the females intention.&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2000). Why men rape. The Sciences, 40(1), 30-36. Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; Females are however better at reading platonic signals from the opposite sex and at differentiating between liking, loving and sexual suggestiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Abbey, A. (1982). "Sex Differences in Attributions for Friendly Behavior: Do Males Misperceive Females' Friendliness?" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 42:830-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also gender differences between how sexual suggestiveness is displayed via flirting. Recent research has shown that females are more likely than males to flirt with the intention of developing a new relationship,&lt;ref&gt;Messman, S. J., Canary, D. J., &amp; Hause, R. S. (2000). Motives to remain platonic, equity and the use of maintenance strategies in opposite sex friendships. Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 17, 67-94.&lt;/ref&gt; or with the intention of intensifying an existing relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, J. L., Damhave, K. W. (1991) The effect of place, type of comment and effort expended on the perception of flirtation. Journal of Social Behavior and Personality, 6, 35-43&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that females use flirting as a way of assessing the interest of a potential mate; as the end result is sexual activity, it can be inferred that this is a sexually suggestive act.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. M., &amp; Butler, D. I. (1989). Predictive aspects of non-verbal courtship behavior in women. Semiotica, 76, 205-215&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a variety of different researchers have found that males are significantly more sexually motivated in their displays of sexual suggestiveness (such as flirting) than females.&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, D. D. (2004). Flirting with meaning: An examination of miscommunication in flirting interactions. Sex Roles, 50(7-8), 481-489&lt;/ref&gt; The research done by Clark and Hatfield (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R. D., &amp; Hatfield, E. (1989). Gender differences in awareness of courtship initiation tactics. Sex Roles, 32, 717-734.&lt;/ref&gt; supports these assumptions by clearly suggesting that female courtship is motivated by relationship development and that male courtship is motivated by sexual desire. It is these gender differences that can explain the potential miscommunication of social actions.

==Cultural differences==

Since the 1990s there has a been a dramatic increase in the understanding of human sexuality from an [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary perspective]].&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (2015). Evolutionary psychology: The new science of the mind. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary theory proposes that humans all behave in the same way, in order to maximise survival and [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref name="Frederick, D. A. 2010"/&gt; However, as with much of human behavior, there are substantial differences in the sexual suggestiveness of people from different cultures. What may be a culturally appropriate display of 'sexiness' in one culture may be considered inappropriate in another, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Frederick, D. A. 2010"/&gt; For example, in many Westernized cultures women displaying their bare legs in public is considered to be a relatively unassuming display of suggestiveness, while in many African societies, for example, the same behavior would be considered immodest. It can be argued that religion is a significant factor in the cultural differences of sexual suggestiveness, especially with regards to what displays of suggestiveness are considered appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Melman, B. (2016). Women’s Orients: English Women and the Middle East, 1718–1918: Sexuality, Religion and Work. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, some [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] communities are more strict on what levels of suggestiveness are appropriate for unmarried young women.

==In the media ==

===General===
A considerable amount of research has concluded that sexually suggestive content is pervasive in the media. The most common type of sexually suggestive content in adolescent programming is in the form of a sexual [[innuendo]]. Sexual [[innuendo]]es give a suggestive alternative meaning to an otherwise neutral phrase. For example, the use of the phrase "bend over backwards" when describing a colleague, in the sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', is used by the main character Barney to imply something in both a figurative sense (i.e. that she is willing to work hard) and a suggestive sense (alluding to her flexibility in sexual positions). Content analyses of sexual behavior in the media found that sexual content on television has risen from 45% in 1975 to 81% now.&lt;ref name=kunkel1999&gt;Kunkel, D., Cope, K., Farinola, W., Biely, E., Rollin, E., &amp; Donnerstein, E. (1999). Sex on TE.' A biennial report to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 2001. Menlo Park, CA: The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; 83% of all programs on television contain sexual content.&lt;ref name=pardun2005&gt;Pardun, C.J., L’Engle, K.L., &amp; Brown, J.D. (2005). Linking exposure to outcomes: Early adolescents’ consumption of sexual content in six media. Mass Communication &amp; Society, 8(2), 75-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collins2004&gt;Collins, R.L., Elliott, M. N., Berry, S. H. et al. (2004). Watching sex on television predicts adolescent initiation of sexual Behavior. Pediatrics. 114(3). Available at: www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/114/3/e280&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of programs contain sexually suggestive references, and 49% of shows contain sexual behavior which include flirting.&lt;ref name=kunkel1999 /&gt; Sexual [[innuendo]]es occur as much as twice per program in popular American sitcoms, whilst flirting occurred at least once per programme.&lt;ref name=pardun2005 /&gt; The use of sexual [[innuendo]]es in the media is also done through newspapers, magazines and music, and accounts for roughly 12% of the entire sexual content shown in the media overall.&lt;ref name=pardun2005 /&gt;  Analysis of sexually suggestive behavior in sports media showed that there was considerable gender differences in how sports stars are portrayed visually.&lt;ref name=clavio2011&gt;Clavio, G., Eagleman, A. N. (2011). Gender and Sexually Suggestive Images in Sports Blogs. Journal of Sport Management, 7, 295-304&lt;/ref&gt; For example, females are photographed nude more frequently than men, and were photographed in a ''hetero-sexy'' manner which was done to attract the [[male gaze]], such as with sports equipment covering their genitalia due to its suggestive nature.&lt;ref name=clavio2011 /&gt; Overall, females are portrayed in a manner that alludes to their status as a [[sex symbol]].

Sexual content in the form of [[innuendo]], suggestive imagery and [[double entendre]] is used as a tool in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Courtney, A., Whipple, T. (1983). Sex Stereotyping in Advertising (Lexington, MA: Heath)&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestive advertising is used to draw in attention,&lt;ref name=reichert2004&gt;Reichert, T. Carpenter, C. (2004). An update on sex in magazine advertising: 1983 to 2003. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly, 81(4), 823-837&lt;/ref&gt; by monopolizing attentional resources, and as a means of distinguishing their products from similar products which are usually advertised in the same medium (such as in the same magazine).&lt;ref name=reichert2004 /&gt; Furthermore, advertisers use sexually suggestive material to imply an association between their product and benefits which are in some way related to sex (such as mate attraction).&lt;ref name=reichert2000&gt;Reichert, T. Ramirez, A. (2000) "Defining Sexually Oriented Appeals in Advertising: a Grounded Theory Investigation". Association for Consumer Research, 27, 267-273.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a significant increase in the amount of advertisements from 1983 to 2003 which used sexually suggestive images of models,&lt;ref name=reichert2004 /&gt; suggesting that advertisers are finding it beneficial. While the physical properties of the model are the most sexually suggestive, a number of non-verbal communicative features have also been identified as being provocative, such as the models pose (plumped lips, cocked head to show the neck) as well as verbal communicative features such as suggestive comments.&lt;ref name=reichert2000 /&gt;

=== Effects ===
A number of studies have looked at the effects of sexual content in the media on [[preadolescent]] and [[adolescent]] sexual development. It has been put forth that watching a high level of television, in which there is a lot of sexually suggestive behavior, can lead to the initiation of sexual intercourse at a younger age than those who watch the least amount of sexually suggestive programming.&lt;ref name=collins2004 /&gt; In addition to this, adolescents who had been exposed to a high level of sexual content, would engage in a level of sexual activity expected by those up to three years older who watched less sexual content.&lt;ref name=collins2004 /&gt; It has been suggested that according to [[social learning theory]], television is a method by which children can acquire behaviors, through observational learning,&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A., Ross, D., Ross, S.A. (1963). Imitation of film-mediated aggressive models. J Abnorm Soc Psychol, 66, 3–11&lt;/ref&gt; and that this is a potential method through which children are becoming increasingly sexualized.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, J. L., Sorsoli, C. L., Collins, K., Zylbergold, B. A., Schooler, D., &amp; Tolman, D. L. (2007). From sex to sexuality: Exposing the heterosexual script on primetime network television. Journal of Sex Research, 44, 145 – 157&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs) and [[pregnancy]] in the U.S are more common among adolescents who begin sexual activity earlier, demonstrating that earlier sexualization, for which sexually suggestive content in the media has been implicated, has far reaching effects.&lt;ref name=collins2004 /&gt;

Sexually suggestive content can also affect adolescents' views and attitudes towards sex, and their sexual socialization as whole. Research conducted with the [[cultivation theory]] in mind, has found that there is an association between people with a high regular exposure to sexually oriented genres (such as [[soap operas]] and [[hip-hop music]]) and more liberal attitudes towards sexual behavior like the acceptance of pre-marital sex, as well as non-relational sex and sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. M. (2002). Does television exposure affect emerging adults’ attitudes and assumptions about sexual relationships? Correlational and experimental confirmation. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 31, 1–15&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as sexual competence is portrayed as a positive attribute on television, particularly for males, regular exposure to sexual content can cause adolescents to form unrealistic expectations, and view their own sexual experiences  (or lack thereof) as negative.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. M. (2003). Understanding the role of entertainment media in the sexual socialization of American youth: A review of empirical research. Developmental Review, 23, 347-388&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the vast majority of this sexual content alludes to the positive nature of sex only, suggesting that sexually suggestive behavior in the media is serving to perpetuate a view that there are little negative consequences of engaging in sexual activity. Research has shown that the effects of sexually suggestive references in the media are also moderated by the developmental stage of the viewer. For example, 12 year olds have more difficulty correctly interpreting [[innuendos]] than 14 year olds.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman-Watkins, L. T.,  Sprafkin, J. N. (1983). Adolescents’ comprehension of televised sexual innuendos. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 4, 359–369&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, pre-pubescent adolescents often view sexual references on television with disgust and embarrassment, whereas pubescent adolescents viewed it with interest.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D., White, A. B., Nikipoulou, L. (1993). Disinterest, intrigue and resistance: Early adolescent girls’ use of sexual media content. In B. Greenberg, J. D. Brown, &amp; N.

The '''Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction''' (SPIE) system was developed as a means to rapidly insert and/or extract a [[reconnaissance]] [[patrol]] from an area that does not permit a helicopter to land.  SPIE has application for rough terrain as well as water inserts/extracts. It is an adaptation of the [[Vietnam War]]-era [[STABO]] rig.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vietnamgear.com/kit.aspx?kit=661&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the SPIE rope is lowered into the pickup area from a hovering helicopter.  Patrol personnel, each wearing a harness with an attached [[carabiner]], hook up to a D-ring inserted in the SPIE rope.  A second safety line is attached to a second D-ring located above the first.  The helicopter lifts vertically from an extract zone until the rope and personnel are clear of obstructions, then proceeds in forward flight to a secure insert zone.  The rope and personnel are treated as an external load and airspeeds, altitudes, and oscillations must be monitored.&lt;ref&gt;FMFM 7-40 Helicopter Rope Suspension Training (HRST) Operations&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Coast Guard]] uses a similar technique to board ships when speed and stealth are required.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==History==
The Special Personnel Insertion/Extraction was first designed by the Marines of [[1st Force Reconnaissance Company]], the Marine division's [[1st Reconnaissance Battalion]], and the [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]] riggers.  They created and combat tested several versions of the SPIE before it was officially recommended to be tested.  In May 1970, the commanding general of [[3rd Marine Expeditionary Force|3rd Marine Amphibious Force]] coordinated input from the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] and his [[1st Marine Air Wing]].  A request was sent to the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] and to the Development Center for certification of the SPIE rig and to its safety and use.&lt;ref name="Meyers, 1stFORECON"&gt;Bruce F. Meyers, ''Fortune Favors the Brave: The Story of First Force Recon,'' (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The parachute test jumpers of the Naval Parachute Unit (NPU) and Marine Corps, all qualified parachutist designers and engineers, assembled together at [[Naval Air Facility El Centro|El Centro]] for the initial testing and evaluation of the SPIE rig.  After a few test dummies were tried, Marine Major Bruce F. Meyers, along with four Navy NPU parachutist engineers, successfully attempted the first flight on the SPIE assembly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">'''Energy statistics''' refers to collecting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating data on commodities such as [[coal]], [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[electricity]], or renewable energy sources ([[biomass]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[wind power|wind]] or [[solar power|solar energy]]), when they are used for the energy they contain. [[Energy]] is the capability of some substances, resulting from their physico-chemical properties, to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or produce [[heat]]. Some energy commodities, called [[fuels]], release their [[energy content]] as heat when they [[combustion|burn]]. This heat could be used to run an [[Internal combustion engine|internal]] or [[external combustion engine]].

The need to have [[statistics]] on energy commodities became obvious during the [[1973 oil crisis]] that brought tenfold increase in [[petroleum prices]]. Before the crisis, to have accurate data on global energy supply and demand was not deemed critical. Another concern of energy statistics today is a huge gap in energy use between [[developed country|developed]] and [[developing country|developing]] countries. As the gap narrows (''see picture''), the pressure on energy supply increases tremendously.[[Image:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|525px|Global energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]] 

The data on energy and electricity come from three principal sources:
* [[Energy industry]]
* Other industries ("self-producers")
* Consumers
The flows of and trade in energy commodities are measured both in physical units (e.g., [[metric ton]]s), and, when [[Energy accounting|energy balances]] are calculated, in energy units (e.g., [[terajoule]]s or [[Ton of oil equivalent|tons of oil equivalent]]). What makes energy statistics specific and different from other fields of [[economic statistics]] is the fact that energy commodities undergo greater number of transformations (flows) than other commodities. In these transformations energy is conserved, as defined by and within the limitations of the [[First law of thermodynamics|first]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|second]] laws of thermodynamics.

'''''Studies in Comparative Religion''''' was a quarterly [[academic journal]] published from 1963 to 1987 that contained essays on the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] practices and [[religious symbolism]] of the world's religions. The journal was notable for the number of prominent [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialists]] who contributed to it. It was also notable for being the first [[English language|English-language]] journal focused on the subject of traditional studies and [[comparative religion]].

== History ==
The journal was established in 1963 by [[Francis Clive-Ross]], who also served as [[editor-in-chief]] and publisher. From 1963 to 1967 the journal was published under the name ''Tomorrow''. Perennialist author [[William Stoddart]] also served as an assistant editor for many years. [[Jacob Needleman]], editor of ''The Penguin Metaphysical Library'', published a collection of essays from ''Studies in Comparative Religion'' under the title "The Sword of Gnosis". The journal ceased publication in 1987 and the articles were unavailable until 2007, when [[World Wisdom]] launched a free on-line [[archive]].

A '''[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=swivel Swivel]''' is a mechanical device used on a [[Drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]] that hangs directly under the [[traveling block]] and directly above the [[kelly drive]], that provides the ability for the kelly (and subsequently the [[drill string]]) to rotate while allowing the traveling block to remain in a stationary rotational position (yet allow vertical movement up and down the derrick) while simultaneously allowing the introduction of [[drilling fluid]] into the ''drill string''.

See [[Drilling rig (petroleum)]] for a diagram of a drilling rig.

{{italic title}}
'''''The Expulsion of the Albanians'''''{{Cref2|a}} ({{lang-sr|Исељавање Арнаута}}/''Iseljavanje Arnauta'') was a lecture presented by the Yugoslav historian [[Vaso Čubrilović]] (1897–1990) on 7 March 1937.&lt;ref name="Petersen2011"/&gt; The text elaborates on the ethnic composition dynamics of [[Kosovo]] and other Albanian populated areas within Yugoslavia from medieval times to present. While explaining why any previous methods put in place by the Yugoslav authorities to overturn the ethnic majority of the Albanians in those areas, such as slow colonization or agrarian reforms, had failed so far, it suggested in details a radical solution, the mass expulsion of Albanians. The expulsion was seen by Čubrilović as a [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] measure, as to prevent potential [[Greater Albania|Albanian irredentism]].

==Background==
In the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], Albanians were concentrated in the [[Kosovo]] region.&lt;ref name=Mylonas-163/&gt;

In 1923, [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Greece and Turkey made a successful population exchange]]. In early 1936, Turkey was interested in signing an agreement for the resettlement of 200,000 Muslims from Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=Mylonas-163/&gt;

Čubrilović, a historian at the [[University of Belgrade]], and former member of the [[Young Bosnia]] organization,&lt;ref name="Kola2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paulin Kola|title=The Search for Greater Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nAANq88bBH8C&amp;pg=PA101|date=January 2003|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|isbn=978-1-85065-664-7|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally presented it as a lecture on 7 March 1937 at the Serbian Cultural Club in Belgrade.&lt;ref name="CohenRiesman1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip J.

The idea, however, persisted. Vaso Čubrilović, a respected historian, wrote in a March 7, 1937, government memorandum entitled "The Expulsion of the Albanians", "It is impossible to repel the Albanians just by gradual colonization...The only possibility and method is the brutal power of a well-organized state... We have already stressed that for us the only efficient way is the mass deportation of the Albanians out of their triange".}}{{dubious-inline|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čubrilović proposed that the Albanians be forced to emigrate free willingly through harassment and [[Colonisation of Kosovo|settling of Serbs]], calling the state for help to make the ''"Arnaut suffer as much as he can"''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Danijela Nadj |url=http://www.hic.hr/books/jugoistocna-europa/velikesrbije.htm#vs |title=Medjunarodni znanstveni skup "Jugoistocna Europa 1918.-1995."

A ruthless collection of taxes would be used and all public schools be closed. Albanian homes and villages could be burnt down, referring to the [[1877–78 expulsions of Albanians]] in [[Niš]] and [[Kuršumlija]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Čubrilović described that the Chetniks and paramilitaries could be of good use where they would pressure the Albanians to leave, making it "the most effective means".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Their land was to be confiscated and given to Montenegrin and Serb settlers and thus change the ethnic structure.&lt;ref name="Kostovicova2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr Denisa Kostovicova|title=Kosovo: The Politics of Identity and Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtHSCXYFpYkC&amp;pg=PA151|date=9 October 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-27632-5|pages=151–}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods would result in ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The International Journal of Albanian Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBUWAQAAMAAJ|publisher=Department of Political Science, Columbia University|page=37|year=1997| volume=1| issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"At a time when Germany can expel tens of thousands of Jews and Russia can shift millions of people from one part of the continent to another, the expulsion of a few hundred thousand Albanians will not lead to the outbreak of a world war. However, those who decide should know what they want and persist in achieving this, regardless of the possible international obstacles."'' | Čubrilović &lt;ref name="Mestrovic2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stjepan Mestrovic|title=Genocide After Emotion: The Post-Emotional Balkan War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdTcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-16349-4|pages=44–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Čubrilović believed that the Albanians were fanatic, superstitious and that previous expulsion plans, like those enacted within the wider Niš region during 1878 in areas such as the [[Toplica (river)|Toplica]] and the [[Morava Valley]]s, was the only effective way. He proposed that Albanians be called ''Turks'' and that their lives should be made as miserable as possible forcing them to leave. Arrangements eventually led to the relocation of tens of thousands of [[Kosovo Albanians]] to Turkey.&lt;ref name="Perritt2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry H. Perritt|title=The Road to Independence for Kosovo: A Chronicle of the Ahtisaari Plan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f2nOTuF_KC0C&amp;pg=PA19|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-11624-4|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and legacy==
The programme was difficult to put into practice because of the economical and political situation at the time. The April War and the collapse of Yugoslavia stopped it and the document remained hidden in archives for years. Čubrilović's paper was "erased" by the Communist authorities because they believed that "all non-Slavic" people should be incorporated into Yugoslavia. The International community found the document in the 1960s which was then given to Albanian President [[Enver Hoxha]] who used it to criticize the Yugoslav authorities, who denied that such a document even existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Danijela Nadj |url=http://www.hic.hr/books/jugoistocna-europa/velikesrbije.htm |title=Medjunarodni znanstveni skup "Jugoistocna Europa 1918.-1995." Ideologija Velike Srbije |website=Hic.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document was mentioned and published in January 1988 in the Belgrade newspaper ''[[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]]'', and later in [[Zagreb]]-based magazine ''Start''. Čubrilović's document was not supported by Yugoslav historians and professors except for [[Ivo Andrić]]. The text was later often quoted and cited as one of the fundamental documents of the [[Greater Serbia]] ideology in the 20th century; that is the basis for methods that were used during the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] by the Serbian authorities for the purpose of ethnic cleansing of Albanians, [[Muslims (nationality)|Muslims]], and [[Croats]].  Some authors believe that Čubrilović's plan to expel Albanians from Kosovo actualized in 1999 by [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s government under the name "[[Operation Horseshoe]]".&lt;ref name="Sell2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Sell|title=Slobodan Milosevic and the Destruction of Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fu1QiZ1n5AgC&amp;pg=PA304|date=4 August 2003|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3223-X|pages=304–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nin.co.rs/2002-07/18/24142.html |title=NIN / Da li je postojao "Plan potkovica" |website=Nin.co.rs |date=1999-07-16 |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report is deemed chauvinistic and nationalistic and was used as a reference to the Serbian atrocities in Kosovo in 1999 by [[Joe DioGuardi]] as he spoke to the US parliament demanding that the United States should be launching [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO-attacks against Yugoslavia]]. During the campaign of ethnic cleansing, over 850,000 Albanians left Kosovo, but soon returned after the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops.

'''The Primordial Tradition''' is a school of religious philosophy which holds its origins in the [[philosophia perennis]], or [[perennial philosophy]], which is in turn a development of the [[prisca theologia]] of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Faivre and Karen-Claire Voss, Western Esotericism and the Science of Religions, in Numen, Vol. 42 (E.

The Primordial Tradition seeks to establish a fundamental origin of religious belief in all authentic religious teachings, adhering to the principle that universal truths are a cross cultural phenomenon and transcendent of their respective traditions, mythologies, and religious beliefs. The idea of the Primordial Tradition was well received by both practitioners and the academic community, and its development was actively endorsed by the International Conference of Religions in Chicago, 1893&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Faivre and Karen-Claire Voss, Western Esotericism and the Science of Religions, in Numen, Vol. 42 (E. J. Brill, Leiden 1995) 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The Primordial Tradition does not elevate any tradition or religion above another and instead upholds the truth claims of all authentic religions and spiritual movements. Adherents of the Primordial Tradition can be found in any religious system such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Paganism]], [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]].

By examining the foundations of religious thought as philosophical [[truth value]]s, the Primordial Tradition seeks to produce a level of wisdom or gnosis which is greater than that which would be provided by the study of a single religious system. The process utilized is similar to the study of the [[history of religions]] and [[comparative mythology]] as is found in the works of authors such as [[Mircea Eliade]]. It can also be found in the school of archetypal psychology and in the ideas of [[Carl Jung]]

Key proponents of the Primordial Tradition have included [[Rene Guenon]], [[Frithjof Schuon]], [[Julius Evola]], [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], [[Elémire Zolla]], [[Alain Danielou]], [[Jean-Louis Michon]],  [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Aldous Huxley]], and [[Plato]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Compositions from the album have been broadcast on several stations, including [[Public Radio Exchange]], [[WDAV]], New England Public Radio ([[WFCR]]) and [[Northwest Public Radio]]. WFCR broadcast the Tchaikovsky recording in November 2011 in recognition of DePreist's 75th birthday, and the Berlioz track in February 2013, following DePreist's death. The Classical Music Sentinel published a positive review of the album, comparing it to a three-movement symphony.

==Composition==
''Tragic Lovers'', released by the record label [[Delos Productions|Delos]] in 2008, contains three works inspired by [[Tragedy|tragic]] love stories in literature: [[Richard Wagner]]'s Prelude and "Liebestod" from ''[[Tristan und Isolde|Tristan and Isolde]]'', [[Hector Berlioz]]'s "Love Scene" from ''[[Roméo et Juliette (Berlioz)|Roméo et Juliette]]'', Op. 17, and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]''. The album contains three tracks, each one comprising a single composition and running more than fifteen minutes in length.&lt;ref name=Liner&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=Tragic Lovers|others=[[Oregon Symphony]]|year=2008|type=booklet|publisher=[[Delos Productions|Delos]]|first1=Harry J.|last1=Pack|first2=Jim|last2=Svejda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amelia Haygood and Carol Rosenberger served as [[executive producer]]s; the [[Record producer|recording producers]] were Michael Fine for the Wagner and Berlioz works and Adam Stern for the Tchaikovsky composition. The album was [[Audio engineer|engineered]] by John Eargle, with Andrés Villalta serving as associate engineer for the Wagner and Berlioz recordings. [[Digital audio editor|Editing]] was completed by Fine (Wagner, Berlioz) and Stern (Tchaikovsky).&lt;ref name=Liner/&gt; The album marked the orchestra's final recording with DePreist as conductor and its final contribution to Delos's "Virtual Reality Recording" series.&lt;ref name=Delos&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://browse.delosmusic.com/Tragic-Lovers-James-DePreist-p/de%203369.htm|title=Tragic Lovers|accessdate=March 28, 2013|publisher=Delos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasts==
All three compositions were featured on the [[Public Radio Exchange]] program "Compact Discoveries"; the Berlioz and Tchaikovsky recordings aired on an episode titled "Famous Lovers: Romeo &amp; Juliet", and the Wagner recording was part of the following episode, titled "More Famous Lovers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prx.org/pieces/32486/transcripts/86770|title=Transcript for the Piece Audio version of Compact Discoveries 151: Famous Lovers: Romeo &amp; Juliet|accessdate=April 18, 2013|publisher=[[Public Radio Exchange]]|first=Fred|last=Flaxman}} Note: Program 151: "Famous Lovers: Romeo &amp; Juliet".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prx.org/pieces/32686/transcripts/87170|title=Transcript for the Piece Audio version of Compact Discoveries 152: More Famous Lovers|accessdate=April 19, 2013|publisher=Public Radio Exchange|first=Fred|last=Flaxman}} Note: Program 152: "More Famous Lovers".&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Joe Brant featured the album on his [[WDAV]] program "New Classics", which highlights newly released classical music recordings.&lt;ref name=WDAV/&gt; New England Public Radio ([[WFCR]]) aired two tracks from the album: the Tchaikovsky recording was broadcast in November 2011 in recognition of DePreist's 75th birthday,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=726746&amp;eventID=11018|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Nov 21, 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2013|publisher=New England Public Radio ([[WFCR]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Berlioz track aired in November 2010 and again on February 11, 2013, following DePreist's death on February 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=624057&amp;eventID=11018|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Nov 02, 2010|publisher=New England Public Radio (WFCR)|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=624331&amp;eventID=11018|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Nov 03, 2010|accessdate=April 22, 2013|publisher=New England Public Radio (WFCR)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=847754&amp;eventID=209404|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Feb 11, 2013|accessdate=April 19, 2013|publisher=New England Public Radio (WFCR)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berlioz recording also aired on the [[Northwest Public Radio]] program "Classical Music with Robin Rilette" on February 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guide.publicbroadcasting.net/nwpr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=845309&amp;eventID=229836|title=NWPR Playlists: Classical Music with Robin Rilette: Robin Rilette: Feb 01, 2013|publisher=[[Northwest Public Radio]] ([[Washington State University]])|accessdate=April 19, 2013|date=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Jean-Yves Duperron of the Classical Music Sentinel appreciated the continuity of the subject matter and compared the album to a three-movement symphony.&lt;ref name=Duperron&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicalmusicsentinel.com/collections/collection-lovers.html|title=Collection – Tragic Lovers – James DePreist (Conductor) – Oregon Symphony Orchestra – Delos DE3369|accessdate=March 28, 2013|first=Jean-Yves|last=Duperron|publisher=Classical Music Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the opener as the first movement of this hypothetical symphony, Duperron wrote that Wagner's composition "works perfectly" by setting the tone for the album. He appreciated the Berlioz composition as a "central movement" for its more "pleasant" mood and lighter musical textures, and Tchaikovsky's work as the finale for its dramatic and "tumultuous" qualities.&lt;ref name=Duperron/&gt; Duperron complimented DePreist and the orchestra for conveying the emotions depicted in each of the compositions "loud and clear", and specifically highlighted the "massive walls of sound" produced by the strings. He also commended Delos for effectively capturing the performances "with clean and powerful dynamics throughout" and concluded the review by quipping: "This perfectly coordinated collection should be part of every collection!"&lt;ref name=Duperron/&gt;

[[File:Transposing instrument- written sounds as.png|thumb|The [[Soprano clarinet|B{{music|flat}} clarinet]] is a transposing instrument. When the note C occurs in a score that is especially written for a B{{music|flat}} clarinet (''top''), the instrument will actually sound a B{{music|flat}} (''bottom''), hence the name of the instrument. The very same fingering when played on an [[Soprano clarinet|A clarinet]] will sound an A, and in a score for A clarinet, an A will be written as a C.]]

A '''transposing instrument''' is a [[musical instrument]] whose music is recorded in [[sheet music|staff notation]] at a [[pitch (music)|pitch]] different from the pitch that actually sounds ([[concert pitch]]). A written [[middle C]] on a transposing instrument produces a pitch other than middle C, and that pitch identifies the [[interval (music)|interval]] of transposition when describing the instrument. For example, a written C on a B{{music|flat}} [[clarinet]] sounds a concert B{{music|flat}}.

Rather than a property of the instrument, the [[transposition (music)|transposition]] is a convention of [[musical notation]]. Instruments whose music is typically notated in this way are called transposing instruments. As transposing instruments is a notation convention, the issue of transposition is mainly an issue for genres of music which use [[sheet music]], such as [[classical music]] and [[jazz]] (while jazz is an [[jazz improvisation|improvisation]]-based type of music, professional players are still expected to be able to read [[lead sheet]]s and [[big band]] sheet music). For some instruments (e.g., the [[piccolo]] or the [[double bass]]), the sounding pitch is still a C, but in a different [[octave]]; these instruments are said to transpose "at the octave".

== Reasons for transposing ==
=== Ease of switching instruments ===
Many instruments are members of a [[family (musical instruments)|family of instruments]] that differ mainly in size (see examples below). The instruments in these families have differing [[Range (music)|range]]s, with the members sounding lower as they get larger; but an identical pattern of [[Fingering (music)|fingering]]s on two instruments in the same family produces pitches a fixed interval apart. For example, the fingerings which produce the notes of a C major scale on a standard [[Western concert flute|flute]], a non-transposing instrument, produce a G major scale on an [[alto flute]]. As a result, these instruments' parts are notated so that the written notes are fingered the same way on each instrument, making it easier for a single instrumentalist to play several instruments in the same family.

Instruments that transpose this way are often referred to as being in a certain "key", such as the "A clarinet" or "clarinet in A". The instrument's key tells which pitch will sound when the player plays a note written as ''C''. A player of a B{{music|flat}} clarinet who reads a written C will sound a B{{music|flat}} while the player of an A clarinet will read the same note and sound an A. The non-transposing member of the family is thus called a "clarinet in C".

Examples of families of transposing instruments:
* [[cornet]]s
* [[saxhorn]]s

Examples of families of non-transposing instruments:
* [[trombone]]s&lt;ref name=Apel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor=[[Willi Apel]]|title=Transposing Instruments|encyclopedia=[[Harvard Dictionary of Music]]|edition=second|year=1972|page=860|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-37501-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[tuba]]s&lt;ref name=Apel /&gt;

Recorders are either untransposed or in some cases transposed at the octave. In the early 20th century, however, instruments with basic scales other than C were sometimes written as transposing instruments.

Examples of families with both transposing and non-transposing instruments:
* [[clarinet]]s
* [[flute]]s
* [[oboe]]s
* [[saxophone]]s
* [[trumpet]]s
The [[euphonium]], with its close relative the [[baritone horn]], may be played as either a [[treble clef]] instrument or a [[bass clef]] instrument because it is often played as a second instrument: trumpet or cornet players who [[doubling (disambiguation#Music|double]] on the euphonium are used to playing in treble clef, while trombone or tuba players who double on the euphonium are used to playing in bass clef. In both cases, the instrument plays in the same range as the trombone, i.e., it produces the same pitches. However, in treble clef, the euphonium is a transposing instrument, i.e., its music and fingering are set up as if it is a B{{music|flat}} instrument (transposing), while in bass clef, its music and fingering assume that it is a C instrument (non-transposing). Musicians who play both bass- and treble-clef euphonium must learn to use different fingerings for the written notes: e.g., a B{{music|flat}} in treble clef requires that the first valve be depressed, whereas a B{{music|flat}} in bass clef is open. 

===Horn crooks===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Before valves were invented in the 19th century, [[Horn (instrument)|horns]] and [[Natural trumpet|trumpets]] could play only the notes of the [[harmonic series (music)|overtone series]] from a single [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]] pitch. (Exceptions included [[Slide (wind instrument)|slide-bearing]] versions such as the [[sackbut]] and finger-hole horns like the [[cornett]] and [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]].) Beginning in the early 18th century, a system of [[crook (music)|crooks]] was devised in Germany, enabling this fundamental to be changed by inserting one of a set of crooks between the mouthpiece and the lead pipe of the instrument, increasing the total length of its sounding tube. As a result, all horn music was written as if for a fundamental pitch of C, but the crooks could make a single instrument a transposing instrument into almost any key. 

Changing these lead-pipe crooks was time-consuming, and even keeping them from falling out while playing was a matter of some concern to the player, so changing crooks could take place only during substantial rests. Medial crooks, inserted in the central portion of the instrument, were an improvement devised in the middle of the 18th century, and they could also be made to function as a slide for tuning, or to change the pitch of the fundamental by a semitone or tone. The introduction of valves made this process unnecessary, though many players and composers found the tone quality of valved instruments inferior ([[Richard Wagner]] sometimes wrote horn parts for both natural and valved horns together in the same piece). F transposition became standard in the early 19th century, with the horn sounding a perfect fifth below written pitch in treble clef. In bass clef, composers differed in whether they expected the instruments to transpose down a fifth or up a fourth.

=== Reconciling pitch standards ===

In the music of Germany during the Baroque period, and notably in the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], instruments used for different purposes were often tuned to different pitch standards, called ''Chorton'' ("choir pitch") and ''Kammerton'' ("chamber [music] pitch"). When they played together in an ensemble, the parts of some instruments would then have to be transposed to compensate. In many of Bach's cantatas the organ part{{clarify|reason=Any source calls an organ tuned to a different pitch standard whose part is transposed to compensate the pitch difference a *transposing instrument*? The subject of this article is *Transposing instrument* and not Miscellaneous uses of transposition|date=February 2014}} is notated a full step lower than the other instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Laurence Dreyfus]]|title=Bach's Continuo Group|year=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-06030-X|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Concert pitch#Pitch inflation|pitch inflation]].

A few early-music ensembles of the present day must do something similar if they comprise some instruments tuned to A415 and others to [[A440 (pitch standard)|A440]], approximately a [[semitone]] apart. Modern builders of continuo instruments sometimes include [[Organ console#Keyboards|moveable keyboards]] which can play with either pitch standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpschd.nu/tech/kb/trans.html|title=CBH Global Harpsichord Technology|author=Carey Beebe Harpsichords Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harpsichord has a single string for each note, plucked by a plectrum and the difference in pitch between the Baroque A at 415&amp;nbsp;Hz and the "modern" A at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz is one half step. Moving the keyboard mechanism right or left causes the A key to play the next string, namely the A{{music|#}} at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz or the A{{music|b}} at 392&amp;nbsp;Hz respectively. Movement of the keyboard allows one to play higher or lower, though the topmost or bottommost key will not produce sound unless the builder has provided extra strings to accommodate the transposition feature.

== Transposition at the octave ==
{{See also|Clef#Octave clefs}}
If an instrument has a range too high or too low for composers to easily write its music on bass or treble clef, the music may be written either an [[octave]] higher or an octave lower than it sounds, in order to reduce the use of [[ledger line]]s. Instruments that "transpose at the octave" are not playing in a different [[key (music)|key]] from concert pitch instruments, but sound an octave higher or lower than written. Music for the [[double bass]] is written an octave higher than it sounds. Thus, when cellos and basses are reading exactly the same part (a common practice by composers from the early Classical period), the basses' bassline is an octave below the cellos'.

Most authorities include this type of notation under the umbrella "transposing instruments",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=[[Harvard Dictionary of Music]]|edition=second|editor=[[Willi Apel]]|year=1972|contribution=Transposing Instruments}}. According to this article, if an octave-transposing clef is used (with a little 8 above or below, the term "transposition" does not apply.&lt;/ref&gt; although it's different from the way the term [[transposition (music)|transposing]] is used in other musical contexts.

== Mechanical and physical considerations ==
Most [[woodwind instrument]]s have one major scale whose execution involves lifting the fingers more or less sequentially from the bottom to top. This scale is usually the one notated as a C scale (from C to C, with no sharps or flats) for that instrument. The note written as C sounds as the note of the instrument's transposition: on an E{{music|flat}} alto saxophone, that note sounds as a concert E{{music|flat}}, while on an A clarinet, that note sounds as a concert A. Clarinets are one exception, in that they actually have two different scales in the first and second registers, nominally an F scale and a C scale, but treated by the performer as sounding "at pitch" for a C clarinet. The [[bassoon]] is another exception; it is not a transposing instrument, yet its "home" scale is F (like the low register of the C clarinet).{{dubious|date=November 2016}}

[[Brass instruments]], when played with no valves engaged (or, for [[trombone]]s, with the slide all the way in), play a series of notes that form the overtone series based on some fundamental pitch, e.g., the B{{music|flat}} [[trumpet]], when played with no valves engaged, can play the overtones based on B{{music|flat}}. Usually, that pitch is the note that indicates the transposition of that brass instrument. Trombones are an exception: they read at concert pitch, although tenor and bass trombones are pitched in B{{music|flat}}, alto trombone in E{{music|flat}}. Double horns are another exception, in that they combine two different sets of tubing into a single instrument, most characteristically in F and B{{Music|flat}}. The horn part is nevertheless transposed uniformly in F (and indeed seldom if ever specifies whether a double or single horn is to be used), with the player deciding when to switch from one side of the instrument to the other. Single B{{Music|flat}} horns also normally read from parts transposed in F.

In general, for these instruments there is some reason to consider a certain pitch the "home" note of an instrument, and that pitch is usually written as C for that instrument. The concert pitch of that note is what determines how we refer to the transposition of that instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwerden.com/eu-articles-bareuph.cfm |title=Baritone or Euphonium? |publisher=Dwerden.com |date=2017-07-20 |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conductor's score==
In [[conducting|conductor]]s' scores and other [[full score]]s, music for transposing instruments is generally written in transposed form, just as in the players' parts. Some composers from the beginning of the 20th century onward have written orchestral scores entirely in concert pitch, e.g. the score of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Prokofiev)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] in D{{music|b}}.

Transposing instruments' names almost always use flats instead of sharps (thus there are instruments in E{{flat}} or in B{{flat}}, but these are never today{{Clarify|date=September 2016}}&lt;!--Was this done in the past?--&gt; called instruments in D{{sharp}} or in A{{sharp}}). In practice the actual transposition in the score may (for the convenience of the player) depend on the key of the music. For example, in a section in C major an E{{flat}} alto saxophone part will appear in A major (three sharps). But in a section in concert B major it would be impractical to notate the sax part in G{{sharp}} major part (a key with eight sharps, i.e. six sharps and one double-sharp). Instead, their part would appear in A{{flat}} major (four flats), just as if they were playing a D{{sharp}} instrument.
