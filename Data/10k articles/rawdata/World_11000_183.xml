      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2978">'''Alaturca''' and '''alafranga''' are musical and cultural concepts specific to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its people. The terms describe a distinction between [[Eastern world|Eastern]] culture and [[Western culture]] in the [[Balkans]]. They are also associated with the old-fashioned (alaturca) and the modern (alafranga). The labels are now considered outdated, but are useful in understanding Ottoman and Turkish cultural history.&lt;ref name=masters&gt;[http://ericederer.com/ethno/Thesis_on_Cumbus_EEderer.pdf Eric Ederer, ''The Cümbüş as Instrument of “the Other” in Modern Turkey'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaturka and alafranga were also competing music genres in the Turkish Republic in the 1920s and 1930s, after the Ottoman Empire was dissolved. Alaturka was associated with the classical music of the Ottoman Empire, while alafranga was associated with European classical music, along with other western music forms penetrating the country.&lt;ref name=masters/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;[https://archive.is/20130624214759/http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/music/degreeprogrammes/postgraduate/supervisors/oconnell.html Cardiff University School of Music, ''Meet our PhD supervisors: Dr John Morgan O'Connell'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Alafranga'' is music or other cultural expression in a western or European style. It was seen in the 18th Century as "exemplifying modernist ideas and trends".&lt;ref name=masters/&gt; Term comes from Italitan "alla franca".
* ''Alaturka'' is music or other cultural expression in a traditional Turkish style. It was seen in the 19th Century as "exemplifying backward-looking traditionalism"—the opposite of alafranga. From Italitan, "à la Turk" or "alla turca"&lt;ref name=masters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rediscovering Dave Brubeck|url=https://www.pbs.org/brubeck/theMusic/davesStyle.htm|author=Hedrick Smith

==Western references==
* [[David Brubeck]] referred to the Turkish people in the title to his tune ''[[Blue Rondo à la Turk]]''. Brubeck heard an unusual rhythm performed by Turkish musicians on the street. Upon asking the musicians where they got the rhythm, one replied "This rhythm is to us what the blues is to you." He named the piece for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rediscovering Dave Brubeck|url=https://www.pbs.org/brubeck/theMusic/davesStyle.htm|author=Hedrick Smith|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Angolan Democratic Forum''' (''Fórum Democrático Angolano'') was a [[political party]] in [[Angola]]. The party was formed by [[UNITA]] dissidents in [[Canada]]. The chairman of FDA was Jorge Rebelo Pinto Chikoti. The FDA aligned with the [[Democratic Reflexion Tendency]] (TRD), which was then not constituted as a formal party. Leaders of TRD included Pablo Tchipilica, Miguel Nzau Puna (former general secretary of UNITA) and Tony da Costa Fernandes.
 
FDA participated in the [[Elections in Angola|1992 parliamentary election]]. Many TDR members were on its lists. The party obtained 12,038 votes (0.3%) and one seat in the National Assembly (Miguel Nzau Puna). When Puna was nominated ambassador of Angola in Canada in 1997, his parliament seat was taken over by António Dias da Silva. In 2006, Dias da Silva was expelled from the parliament.

FDA has ceased to function, but TRD continues to exist.

'''Banco de Desenvolvimento de Angola'''  (English:  Development Bank of Angola) '''(BDA)''' is the public [[bank]] of [[Angola]] to finance investments in "strategic long-term economic development" of the country. It was created July 2006 by government decree No. 37/06. 

The BDA administers the ''Fundo Nacional de Desenvolvimento - FND'' (National Development Fund - NDF) which is supplied by 5% of the fiscal results of the petroleum industry of Angola and 2% of the fiscal results of the diamond activities of Angola. 

In 2008, the bank financed projects worth 8.7 billion [[Kwanza]]s, corresponding to about $ US 116 million.

The '''British Forces Broadcasting Service''' ('''BFBS''') provides radio and television programmes for [[British Armed Forces|Her Majesty's Armed Forces]], and their dependents worldwide. Editorial control is independent of the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces themselves.

It was established by the British [[War Office]] (now the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]) in 1943. In 1944, it was managed by [[Gale Pedrick]].&lt;ref name="Times-57802"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/newspaperRetrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=DateAscend&amp;tabID=T003&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchId=R1&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=44&amp;qrySerId=Locale%28en%2C%2C%29%3AFQE%3D%28tx%2CNone%2C12%29Gale+Pedrick%3AAnd%3ALQE%3D%28MB%2CNone%2C8%29%22TTDA-1%22%24&amp;retrieveFormat=MULTIPAGE_DOCUMENT&amp;userGroupName=bclib&amp;inPS=true&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;&amp;docId=&amp;docLevel=FASCIMILE&amp;workId=&amp;relevancePageBatch=CS171668056&amp;contentSet=UDVIN&amp;callistoContentSet=UDVIN&amp;docPage=article&amp;hilite=y|title=Mr Gale Pedrick|date=24 February 1970|work=[[The Times]]|page=10|accessdate=29 August 2014}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally known as the '''Forces Broadcasting Service (FBS)''', it was initially under the control of the British Army Welfare Service, with its first effort, the Middle East Broadcasting Unit, with its headquarters in [[Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BwJ7ET3erXAC&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;ots=Il917udorQ&amp;dq=%22british%20forces%20network%22%20%22fbs%22&amp;pg=PA215#v=onepage&amp;q=%22british%20forces%20network%22%20%22fbs%22&amp;f=true ''On the Short Waves, 1923-1945: Broadcast Listening in the Pioneer Days of Radio''], Jerome S. Berg, McFarland, 1999, page 215&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and after end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], various radio stations were set up, some using the FBS name, others using the name '''British Forces Network (BFN)''', but by the early 1960s, these had all adopted the BFBS name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-UeveLMilioC&amp;lpg=PA378&amp;dq=%22bfn%22%20radio&amp;pg=PA379#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bfn%22%20radio&amp;f=true ''Encyclopedia of Radio 3''], Volume Set, Christopher H. Sterling, Routledge, 2004, page 379&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, BFBS has formed part of the [[Services Sound and Vision Corporation|Services Sound and Vision Corporation (SSVC)]], a registered charity, which is also responsible for the [[British Defence Film Library]], SSVC Cinemas, and [[Combined Services Entertainment]], providing entertainment for HM Forces around the world.  BFBS does not carry commercial advertising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3842035.stm 'Our aim is to entertain and inform'], [[BBC News Online]], 20 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Forces Radio BFBS is a music, news, entertainment and community service providing bespoke content to the global Forces Community with a focus on Forces News and connecting the Forces communities around the world.

Bespoke news bulletins are broadcast every hour, 24 hours a day, utilising content from [[BBC News]], [[Independent Radio News|IRN]] and BFBS's own team of Forces News reporters. The standard bulletin is three minutes long, with extended ten-minute ''Newsplus'' programmes on weekdays at 0400, 0700, 1100, 1300 and 1700 UK time. Two-minute-long news and sport headlines are broadcast on the half-hour during breakfast programming. Bulletins are broadcast around the clock on BFBS Radio and BFBS Gurkha Radio, and during BFBS Radio 2's music programming.

Many of the programmes on BFBS Radio 2 are sourced from [[BBC Radio 4]] and [[BBC Radio Five Live]], including the soap opera ''[[The Archers]]'', which was popular in Hong Kong until BFBS Radio ceased broadcasting on 30 June 1997 before the [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]] to [[People's Republic of China|China]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/hong-kongs-farewell-to-the-archers--from-pete-and-dud-1267436.html Hong Kong's farewell to the Archers ... from Pete and Dud] ''[[The Independent]]'' 16 April 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

It provides programmes in [[Gurkhali]], for the [[Gurkha]] units serving with the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfbs.com/radio/articles/2202 Gurkha Radio staff from Nepal visit UK], BFBS, March 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

BFBS also has its own programmes, including the daily news bulletin programme ''[[British Forces News]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web202.ssvc.com/news/programmes/british-forces-news |title=British Forces News |publisher=web202.ssvc.com |accessdate=21 August 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214032015/http://web202.ssvc.com/news/programmes/british-forces-news |archivedate=14 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the children's programme ''[[Room 785]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfbs.com/room785/ |title=Room 785 &amp;#124; Room 785 – BFBS Television |publisher=BFBS |accessdate=17 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101140847/http://www.bfbs.com/room785/# |archive-date=1 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BFBS Television was broadcast in some areas as a terrestrial service in the clear using low power transmitters to minimise "overspill" to non-service audiences and protect copyright.&lt;ref name="The Vital Link"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gtSkAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA258&amp;dq=%22BFBS%22%20television&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q=%22BFBS%22%20television&amp;f=false ''The Vital Link: The Story of Royal Signals 1945-1985''], Philip Warner, Pen and Sword, 1989 page 258&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite feed was encrypted for copyright reasons, as it is intended solely for HM Forces and their families. Until 1994, it was also carried on [[cable television|cable]] in [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=V88eVfagItb7apaQgtAO&amp;id=w5kjAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=ssvc+berlin+zitty&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=ssvc+ ''Zitty''], Volume 18, Issues 23-25, Zitty Verlag GmbH, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was only available in the [[History of Berlin#West and East Germany (1945–1990)|British Sector]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hgwcAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=franz%C3%B6sischen++in+Berlin+radio+%22FFB%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+%22SSVC%22 ''Medienlandschaft im Umbruch: Medien- und Kommunikationsatlas Berlin''], Günter Bentele, Otfried Jarren, Ulrich Kratzsch, Vistas Verlag, 1990, page 260&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1997, it was also widely available in Cyprus, but its signal was  encrypted or confined to the [[Sovereign Base Area]]s of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cUtpcm8JRXUC&amp;q=%22BFBS%22+television&amp;dq=%22BFBS%22+television&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXlvif8afLAhUHqxoKHf6zAfoQ6AEIYjAP ''Insight Guide Cyprus''], Julia Roles, Ingram Publishing Services, 1999, page 288&lt;/ref&gt; Following complaints from local broadcasters like [[Lumiere TV]], which had bought local rights to show English [[association football|football]] and other programming, the decision was made to encrypt the signal, starting with [[Nicosia]] in April 1997 and ending with [[Larnaca]] and [[Limassol]] in May 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.org/news/cyprus/cmnews/1998/98-05-10.cmnews.html#02 BFBS pulls the plug on Larnaca viewers], ''[[Cyprus Mail]]'' 10 May 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was criticised by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|MP]]s in an [[Early Day Motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/1995-96/775|title=Early day motion 775 - SSVC TV CYPRUS|website=UK Parliament|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; BFBS later ended terrestrial transmissions of its TV channel in Cyprus in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://famagusta-gazette.com/bfbs-tv-in-cyprus-leaves-the-airwaves-p7216-69.htm BFBS TV in Cyprus leaves the airwaves], ''Famagusta Gazette'', 9 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a result of [[card sharing]] by services personnel, BFBS TV (later BFBS 1) was available to unentitled viewers on the island, along with other channels until 2011, when an illegal pay-TV service was closed down in a joint operation by the [[Cyprus Police]] and the Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aapa.eu/news-and-events/joint-police-and-industry-action-brings-down-card-sharing-pirate/?year=2011&amp;month=6 Joint police and industry action brings down card sharing pirate], Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance, 21 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, BFBS TV was watched by civilians in the [[Falkland Islands]], where for many years, it was the only terrestrial TV service. Initially it consisted of prerecorded programmes brought over on cassette from the UK, meaning that they were shown two weeks after the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=KdMeVaScH42yaevPgvAB&amp;id=lqAnAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=andrew+gurr+zuvic&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=bfbs ''A Little Piece of England''], [[Andrew Gurr]], John Blake, 2001, page 81&lt;/ref&gt; but was later shown on a timeshifted basis (which means that "live" events were shown between 3 and 5 hours after they had actually happened.)  This expanded the civilian terrestrial TV service as part of a digital upgrade, which included BFBS 1 and BFBS 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falklands.gov.fk/assets/Legislative-Assembly-Record-18.12.09.pdf The Record of the meeting of the Legislative Assembly held on Friday 18 December 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517100505/http://www.falklands.gov.fk/assets/Legislative-Assembly-Record-18.12.09.pdf |date=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BFBS 1 and 2 also became available to civilian audiences in [[Tristan da Cunha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tristandc.com/newscommunity05-11.php|title=Tristan da Cunha Community News 2005 - 2011|first=Richard|last=Grundy|website=www.tristandc.com|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Forces and their families stationed at [[British Army Training Unit Suffield]] (BATUS), located at [[CFB Suffield|Canadian Forces Base Suffield]] in Canada, had access to BFBS 1, a limited amount of BFBS 2 and BFBS 3 and Sky News on a 7-hour timeshift from CET.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfbs.com/tv/country_guides/canada |title=Canada &amp;#124; BFBS Television |publisher=BFBS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610182010/http://www.bfbs.com/tv/country_guides/canada |archivedate=10 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the day, the television channel that BFBS 2/3 broadcast on, played BFBS Radio 1.

In 2005, BFBS also began distributing commercial networks [[Kiss TV]] (previously
[[Q (TV channel)|Q]]), [[Sky News]], [[Sky Sports|Sky Sports 1]] and [[Sky Sports|Sky Sports 2]] to certain areas. It also started a movie channel on 2 May 2008, using money that it saved following the [[Premier League]]'s decision to waive the £250,000 rights fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dowell |first=Ben |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/03/british-forces-broadcasting-service-redundancies |title=Forces' TV and radio set to cut 30 jobs |publisher=The Guardian |date=13 August 2007 |accessdate= 24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, BFBS also added Nepali TV (a TV channel in Nepali language based in the UK) in its channel line up for the benefit of Gurkha soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/201012109285/arqiva-adds-nepali-tv-to-ssvcs-british-forces-platforms.html Arqiva adds Nepali TV to SSVC’s British Forces platforms], [[Arqiva]], 10 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This was replaced by [[Nepal Television]] (the state TV broadcaster of Nepal) on 1 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/GurkhaRadio/photos/a.145174182201820.34128.141968062522432/1052874271431802/ Nepal TV to broadcast live on BFBS TV] (press release), SSVC (via Facebook)&lt;/ref&gt;

SSVC was awarded a new ten-year contract by the Ministry of Defence commencing on 1 April 2013.  Fewer overseas troop deployments and reduced budgets resulted in a change to the previous TV service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-forces-broadcasting-contract-begins UK Forces broadcasting contract begins], [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], 2 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 27 March 2013, BFBS has offered [[time-shifting|timeshifted]] versions of [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], as well as two channels of its own.

Additionally, the BBC One and ITV feeds are timeshifted to hit peak time in local time zones.

The '''Brotherhood of Independent Baptist Churches and Ministries of Ukraine''' was officially founded and registered in [[Ukraine]] in 1993.

==Structure==
The foundation of this new Baptist Union was organized and initiated by a group of churches, which for nearly thirty years had been active members of the Union of Churches movement. Among these churches-initiators there were churches of the Union of Baptist Churches in [[Kiev]], [[Zhitomir]], Khartsyzsk, [[Kharkov]], [[Rovno]], Zdolbunov, etc. Today the Brotherhood includes more than 100 communities and about 11,000 members.

The '''Catania Elephants''' are a professional [[American football]] team in [[Catania, Italy]].

The Elephants failed to apply for the 2013 [[Italian Football League|IFL]] season due to money issues, so the team started the 2013 season in LeNAF (II Division), another nationwide football league with no imports (only Italian Players).

'''Chiprovtsi Monastery''' ({{lang-bg|Чипровски манастир}}, ''Chiprovski manastir'') is a [[Bulgarian Orthodox]] monastery 5 kilometres northeast of the town of [[Chiprovtsi]] in [[Montana Province]] in northwestern [[Bulgaria]]. It belongs to the diocese of [[Vidin]] and lies in the valley of the [[Ogosta]] river.

According to Petar Bogdan, the monastery was built in the 10th century and remained a religious and cultural centre despite [[Tatars|Tatar]] and [[Magyars|Magyar]] raids in the 13th century, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion in the 14th century and [[Michael the Brave]]'s raids in the 16th century. The monastery has been razed six times, in 1412, 1688, 1806, 1828, 1837 and 1876, with the one of 1688 after the [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] being particularly devastating. The current monastery church was built in 1829.

The Chiprovtsi Monastery consists of a church dedicated to Saint [[John of Rila]], residential buildings, a small graveyard and a three-storey tower featuring an ossuary, a chapel and a belfry.

A '''coarb''', from the [[Old Irish]] ''comarbae'' ([[Irish language|Modern Irish]] ''comharba'', [[Latin]]: ''hērēs''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=a7uTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=latin+erenagh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OHj5mcy7MV&amp;sig=3IWeAFjNq0q9v4puzbD_42O2QTg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig277ju_7bAhWeOsAKHSAJB6Q4ChDoAQgyMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=latin+erenagh&amp;f=false|title=Medieval Ireland: An Encyclopedia|first=Seán|last=Duffy|date=15 January 2005|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;), meaning "heir" or "successor",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clanlivingstone.com/coarb.htm |title=Coarb |date=Sep 2, 2004 |publisher=Clan Livingstone Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a distinctive office of the medieval church among the [[Gaels]] of Ireland and Scotland. In this period coarb appears interchangeable with "[[Erenagh|erenach]]", denoting the episcopally nominated lay guardian of a parish church and headman of the family in hereditary occupation of church lands. The coarb, however, often had charge of a church which had held comparatively high rank in pre‐Norman Ireland, or one still possessed of relatively extensive termon lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to Irish History |last=Etchingham |first=Colmán |editor-last=Connolly |editor-first=Sean J. |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O245-coarb.html |isbn=9780198662709 |edition=2nd |page=107 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810112811/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O245-coarb.html |archivedate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also as per this article "... such lucrative monastic offices as “coarb” (comarbae “heir” to a saint) or “[[Erenagh|erenach]]” (airchinnech “superior”), otherwise transmitted by natural or nepotic descent within ecclesiastical families, which were often the politically displaced branches of royal dynasties"

==The coarb of Columba==
In medieval Ireland and Scotland, the coarb of [[St Columba]] ([[Medieval Gaelic]] ''comarba Coluim Chille'') identified the abbots who succeeded Columba. When the monks fled to their monastery in Kells, following the 9th-century Viking raids on Iona, their abbot continued to hold the title of coarb to reflect his direct inheritance: many of the early abbots were members of Columba's family.

The abbot of the [[collegiate church]] (i.e., [[monastery]] following the Rule of St Columba), who held [[Holy Orders|holy orders]] and celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] ('serveth the cure'), was responsible for his monastic community. In time, the pattern of a Bishop and an Abbot of Iona was established, which after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] fell into disuse.

[[File:Coat of Arms of Krasnoyarsk (Krasnoyarsk krai).svg|thumb|The coat of arms]]

The '''coat of arms of Krasnoyarsk''' is the [[heraldry|heraldic]] symbol of [[Krasnoyarsk]], Russia.

The first version was approved on March&amp;nbsp;12, 1804. The coat of arms was divided horizontally into two parts, the upper part containing the coat of arms of [[Tomsk Governorate]], and the lower part picturing the [[Krasny Yar cliff]] on a silver background.

A revised coat of arms, approved on November&amp;nbsp;23, 1851, had the golden figure of a lion placed on a red [[heraldry|heraldic]] shield with a spade in the right fore paw and a sickle in the left fore paw, both made of the same metal. The shield was topped with the golden crown of the [[Russian Empire]].

The current coat of arms (as depicted here) was approved on November&amp;nbsp;28, 2004. It contains the same red shield as in 1851 but with a slightly changed figure of the lion in the officially approved image. The shield is topped with a form of the [[mural crown]], which is the golden five-tower [[Crown (heraldry)#As a display of rank|coronet of rank]] of a federal subject administrative center.

In 2005, a {{convert|16|m|sp=us|adj=on}} tall pillar with a bronze statue of the Krasnoyarsk heraldic lion upon its top was erected at the [[Krasnoyarsk Railway Station]] square.

}}
The '''''Da Ming Hunyi Tu''''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]] for the "Composite Map of the [[Ming Empire]]") is an extensive [[China|Chinese]] map. It was painted in colour on stiff silk and 386 x 456&amp;nbsp;cm in size.&lt;ref name="Wang et al. 1994:51"&gt;(Wang et al. 1994:51)&lt;/ref&gt; The original text was written in [[Classical Chinese]], but on the surviving copy [[Manchu language|Manchu]] labels were later superimposed. The surviving copy of the map shows later revisions, and it is uncertain whether it is (or how closely it matches) the original.

It is one of the oldest surviving maps from East Asia although the exact date of creation remains unknown. It depicts [[Eurasia]], placing China in the center and stretching northward to [[Mongolian Plateau|Mongolia]], southward to [[Java]], eastward to central [[Japan]], and westward to  [[Europe]] (including the [[East Africa]]n coast as an island).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==History==
The map was created  sometime during the [[Ming dynasty]] and handed over to the new rulers of China, the [[Manchu]]s.

The place names of China on the map reflect the political situation in 1389, or the 22nd year of the reign of the [[Hongwu Emperor]]. Thus some Chinese scholars concluded that it was indeed created in 1389 or little later.&lt;ref name="Wang et al. 1994:51"/&gt; Others maintain a cautious attitude, suggesting that what was created in 1389 is probably a source map of the ''Da Ming Hunyi Tu'' and that the ''Da Ming Hunyi Tu'' itself dates much later.&lt;ref name="Miya 2006:511-512"&gt;(Miya 2006:511-512)&lt;/ref&gt;

In either case, it is certain that the Ming dynasty created a map around 1389. Japanese scholar Miya Noriko speculated on the motivation behind it: Although the Hongwu Emperor, first of the [[Ming dynasty]], drove the [[Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]] out of China in 1368, Mongols maintained military power that posed a real threat to the new dynasty. The situation was changed in 1388 when [[Uskhal Khan]] of Northern Yuan was killed and the Khubilaid line of succession was terminated. The Ming dynasty may have celebrated this historic event by creating a new map.&lt;ref name="Miya 2006:511-512"/&gt;

It has been kept on the Imperial Palace and was called ''Qingzi Qian Yitong Tu'' (清字簽一統圖; "Manchu text-labelled unified map") in some catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs 1962:2&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently kept in protective storage at the First Historical Archive of China, in [[Beijing]]. A full-sized digital replica was made for the South African government in 2002.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;AFP press release [http://groups.google.co.uk/group/it.discussioni.misteri/msg/cb95fb13d317712a Ancient map of Africa poses questions], Nov 2002- via Google Groups, accessed 2008-03-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other maps==
{{main article|Chinese cartography}}
Maps had for centuries played an important role in the government of such a vast country, and surviving [[Chinese geography|examples on stone]] dating from AD 1137 but based on much earlier surveys, show great accuracy, using a [[Zhang Heng#Cartography|grid system]]. By then the Chinese had also developed the magnetic [[compass]], and in the 13th century western versions of that device allowed European cartography to catch up with Chinese standards of accuracy.

By the early years of the 14th century, when [[Mongol Empire|Mongol domination]] over much of [[Eurasia]] created favourable conditions for east-west communication, [[Geography in medieval Islam|Islamic maps]] of Europe and Africa had found its way to China, encouraging Chinese cartographers to create world maps incorporating the new information.

Scholars consider that the ''Da Ming Hunyi Tu'' was ultimately based on a now lost world map named ''Shengjiao Guangbei Tu'' (聲教廣被圖).&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi 1975:16-21; Miya 2006:511-512&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by Li Zemin during the Mongol Yuan dynasty. Other extant maps considered to be based on Li's map are some copies of the ''[[Kangnido]]'' (1402) and a pair of maps named ''Dongnan Haiyi Tu'' (東南海夷圖) and ''Xinan Haiyi Tu'' (西南海夷圖),&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi 1975:15,20; Miya 2006:509-511&lt;/ref&gt; which is recorded in the ''[[Guang Yu Tu]]'' (廣與圖) (1555) by [[Luo Hongxian]] (羅洪先). Comparative studies of these extant maps are conducted to restore the content of Li's original world map. The ''Da Ming Hunyi Tu'' is especially important because Luo's copies dropped most place names except for coastal areas and islands and because the ''Kangnido'' was influenced by Korean cartography.

Compared to the ''Kangnido'', the ''Da Ming Hunyi Tu'' provides more detailed information on Mongolia and Central Asia and India.&lt;ref&gt;Miya 2007:292&lt;/ref&gt; In Manchuria, [[Changbai Mountain]], where the foundation myth of the Manchu [[Aisin Gioro]] imperial family was set, is overly portrayed. It presents India as a peninsula while it sinks into the "Chinese continent" on the ''Kangnido''.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs 1962:3; Miya 2006:511&lt;/ref&gt; It is presumed that India was portrayed as a peninsula on Li's map but shrunk by Korean Confucians due to their anti-Buddhist policy.&lt;ref&gt;Miya 2006:511,590-591&lt;/ref&gt; Africa and Arabia on the ''Da Ming Hunyi Tu'' resemble those on the ''Kangnido'' while Europe is considerably different.&lt;ref&gt;Kinda Akihiro 金田章裕: ''Konitsu kyōri rekidai kokuto no zu no keifu wo meguru ichi shikaku'' 混一疆理歴代国都之図の系譜をめぐる一視角, Daichi no shōzō 大地の肖像, pp. 448-454, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also distinct from the ''Kangnido'' in the depiction of the source of the Yellow River, which looks very similar to that in Luo's ''Guang Yu Tu''.&lt;ref&gt;Miya 2007:289&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The Earth's curvature affects even the scale of the Chinese section of the map. Horizontally, it works out at about 1:820,000; but vertically it is around 1:1,060,000.&lt;ref&gt;Wang et al. 1994:51-52&lt;/ref&gt; The use of colour is particularly effective within China itself, including elegant touches like the ochre tint of the [[Yellow River]].

It replicates the curvature of the Earth by compression of areas farthest away from China (most obviously the extreme horizontal squeeze of Europe), their reduced size making both a geographical and a political statement. Outside China, sub-Saharan Africa is depicted in a good approximation of the correct shape, complete with mountains near the southern tip. The interior of the continent is extraordinary: a river with twin sources (the common depiction in Classical and Islamic maps of the Nile) starts in the south of the continent, but enters the Red Sea, while the Nile, contrary to the information in non-Chinese maps of the era (though in conformity with a reported Arab geographical legend that "farther south from the Sahara Desert is a great lake, far greater than the [[Caspian Sea]]"&lt;ref name="afp"/&gt;) has its source in a vast inland sea. This is likely to be based on vague information about the several [[African Great Lakes|great lakes]] in the region of modern [[Tanzania]], gained during the course of direct trade between China and south-east Africa.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
[[Image:Daminghunyitu-stretched-detail.jpg|right|thumb|216px|Detail, stretched sideways, with seas coloured]]

The European coverage goes only as far as the new [[portolan]] mapping, showing the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]] areas. Unlike the African lake.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} those seas are not shaded with wave symbols, and nor is the nearby Caspian Sea,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} mapped in Islamic style with two islands, suggesting that the whole area is based on a single Islamic map.  Arabia is squeezed horizontally, but recognisable. The prominent peninsula on the west coast of the Chinese landmass is [[Malay peninsula|Malaysia]], but India is represented merely as a collection of place-names north-west of Arabia.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Another manifestation of the same problem, dependence on external sources for geographical information, can be seen to the south of Korea, at the far right side of the map, where Japan, over-sized and misshapen, confusingly meets the much more correctly sized and positioned [[Taiwan]].

'''''Daratt''''' ([[English language|English]]: "Dry Season", [[French language|French]]: "Saison sèche") is a 2006 film by [[Chad]]ian director [[Mahamat Saleh Haroun]].

The film was one of seven films from non-Western cultures commissioned by [[Peter Sellars]]' New Crowned Hope Festival to commemorate the 250th birthday of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].  Inspiration for the themes of revenge and reconciliation was taken from Mozart's ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]''.

''Darratt'' won the Grand Special Jury Prize at the [[63rd Venice International Film Festival]], as well as eight other prizes at Venice and the [[Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou]].

== Plot ==
Set in the wake of the long Chadian civil war, 16-year-old Atim ([[Ali Bacha Barkai]]) is sent by his grandfather to the city to kill Nassara ([[Youssouf Djaoro]]), the man who murdered his father before Atim's birth.  Atim, carrying his father's gun, finds Nassara running a bakery.  Unexpectedly, the taciturn Nassara takes Atim under his wing as the son he never had and begins teaching him how to run the bakery.  The emotionally conflicted Atim is drawn into the life of Nassara and his pregnant wife ([[Aziza Hisseine]]), before a finale that [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] described as "sharp, fast and unexpected."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117931446.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 ''Dry Season''] by Deborah Young, [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']], September 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dialog TV (DTV)''' is a [[direct broadcast satellite]] pay TV service provider based in [[Sri Lanka]]. A fully owned subsidiary of [[Dialog Axiata PLC]], Dialog TV was launched in July 2005 under the name "CBNsat". It was later renamed to Dialog TV in February 2007 after the company was acquired by [[Dialog Axiata|Dialog Axiata PLC]].

Dialog TV currently has over one million users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isis.lk/business/1378-dialog-tv-reaches-1-million-homes|title=DIALOG TV REACHES ONE MILLION|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main competitors in the [[pay TV]] market in Sri Lanka are [[Dish TV Sri Lanka]], which is a subsidiary of [[Dish TV]] India, Lanka Broadband Networks (LBN) which provides [[cable television]] services in [[Analog television|analog]] and [[DVB-C]] in selected areas in Sri Lanka and [[PEO TV]], which is an [[IPTV]] platform operated by [[Sri Lanka Telecom|Sri Lanka Telecom PLC]].

Dialog TV has coverage over the entirety of [[Sri Lanka]] through the Intelsat 904 satellite.

==Services==

Dialog TV is a provider of [[Standard-definition television|Standard Definition TV]] (SDTV), [[High-definition television|High Definition TV]] (HDTV) and [[Digital video recorder|Personal Video Recording]] (PVR) services in Sri Lanka. Dialog Television currently offers 144 TV channels, including 7 HD channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.dialog.lk/television|title = Dialog TV|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialog TV offers 2 payment options for customers to receive their service. "Per Day Packages" allows the customer to pay a daily rental fee ranging from Rs.3 to Rs.12 for a limited number of channels. Alternatively the Postpaid payment method has 5 package options with a monthly rental fee of between Rs.699 to Rs.1949 for higher number of channels.

==Development and expansion==
Dialog TV signed an agreement with ESPN and Star Sports on 7 March 2006, and launched the channels on 24 March 2006. The Zee package ([[Zee TV]], [[Zee Cafe]], [[Zee Cinema]], [[Zee Trendz]], [[Zee Sports]], [[Zee Muzic]], [[Zee Studio]]) was launched in January. [[Al Jazeera English]] was launched on 19 April 2007, replacing the [[Sony Entertainment Television Asia|SET]] channel.

In March 2007, Dialog TV won exclusive rights to broadcast the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in Sri Lanka.[http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/4653]

Dialog TV's third transponder was launched in late April 2007. The third transponder is now available on Dialog TV for all subscribers, and all except one of the new channels are launched. The [[STAR TV|STAR]] package was launched on August 3, 2007. [[STAR Cricket]] was added on August 7, 2007.

A software upgrade was tested on 8 June, although it only updated to the June 1, 2006 software, which is included on all decoders sold from January 2007. The 2007 July update was made available on July 18, 2007. This update changed all logos and names on the software to "Dialog TV" from the previous "CBNsat". The software was automatically installed to decoders at 3.00 pm on July 18, 2007, and at 6.00 pm and 9.00 pm on the same day for those who missed the previous updates. If all automatic updates were missed, it is possible to update the software using the IRD Upgrade menu option on the decoder.

By mid 2012, Dialog TV had introduced South India's pioneering Tamil channels,namely [[Sun TV (India)|Sun TV]], [[KTV (India)|KTV]] and [[Sun Music]].

By 18 February 2015, Dialog TV had decided to upgrade it MPEG-4 service by increasing its channel rate from 94-120.

By 18 May 2015, Dialog TV had reached over 500,000 active subscribers.For that reason, Dialog TV gave 30 days free subscription to all channels to all Dialog TV subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By 6 April Dialog TV adds new Test Channels increasing the channel rate to 144.

==Criticism and controversy==

===CBNsat and NTT===

On June 6, 2006, the [[Sri Lanka Police]]'s Criminal Investigation Department raided the CBNsat broadcast premises and ordered to shut down the service. CBNsat was accused of not possessing the correct DTH broadcasting license and broadcasting the NTT channel (of the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|LTTE]]) on their service. CBNsat was also blamed for broadcasting possibly illegal adult content on [[Fashion TV]].

The Media Ministry took over the case when the CID dropped their charges in late 2006. It was not possible to show evidence of CBNsat broadcasting the NTT channel as it blocked Free To Air channels from the customer decoders and NTT was a Free To Air channel.

The Media Ministry could not prove any of the allegations and was finally forced to provide the necessary license to CBNsat. Meanwhile, CBNsat was financially crippled and was acquired by [[Dialog Telekom]] in December 2006 for a value of Rs. 523.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ftp.hortondebate.com/news/sri-lankas-dialog-telekom-picks-up-cable-operator-cbn-sat/667173635|title=Dialog TV|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service was finally relaunched in February 2007.

As a result of the closure, a few subscribers gathered together to form CBNsat Subscribers Unite. The subscribers worked hard to bring CBNsat out of trouble during the closure, and ultimately caused the government to give up their vested interests.

On November 22, 2014, A domestic Sri Lanka TV channel [[Sirasa TV]], a part of [[Capital Maharaja]] Conglomerate, hosted a what expert called a critical political discussion show called "Satana" (weeks before the 2015 Presidential Election). It was reported by vast number of viewer using Dialog TV and [[PEO TV|Peo TV]] to watch Sirasa TV channel and their affiliated sister channels ([[Shakthi TV]] and [[TV One (Sri Lanka)|MTV Sports]]) that their feed got interrupted for the channel during the political show. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsfirst.lk/english/2014/11/breaking-sirasa-network-channels-experience-disruptions-dialog-peo-tv/64055|title=Breaking: Viewers can watch our channels on UHF and VHF frequencies|date=2014-11-22|work=Sri Lanka News - Newsfirst {{!}} Breaking News and Latest News provider {{!}} Political {{!}} Sports {{!}} International {{!}} Business|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many outraged Journalists gave out their opinion on the disruption of information to the public during an important political timeline and that the government is trying to suppress the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsfirst.lk/english/2014/11/sirasa-satana-blocked/64175|title=Free Media expresses concern; journalists ask questions about blocking of Sirasa's Satana - Sri Lanka News|date=2014-11-23|work=Sri Lanka News - Newsfirst {{!}} Breaking News and Latest News provider {{!}} Political {{!}} Sports {{!}} International {{!}} Business|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though many pointed the finger towards the Sri Lankan President at the time [[Mahinda Rajapaksa|Mahinda Rajapakshe]], stating that he is the invisible hand that caused the disruption of the feed, he has categorical refused any direct involvement in the matter. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asianmirror.lk/keyhole/item/5182-president-lashes-out-at-telecommunication-boss-after-sirasa-satana-controversy|title=President Lashes Out At Telecommunication Boss After 'Sirasa-Satana' Controversy|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither Dialog TV or Peo TV has failed to provide a rational explanation for the disruption of feed only for few channels owned by one media company. The only explanation Dialog TV has expressed was that the disruption was caused by an "Technical Glitch".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsfirst.lk/english/2014/11/lawyer-saliya-peiris-seeks-clarification-regarding-blocking-satana/64623|title=Lawyer Saliya Peiris seeks clarification regarding the blocking of Satana|date=2014-11-26|work=Sri Lanka News - Newsfirst {{!}} Breaking News and Latest News provider {{!}} Political {{!}} Sports {{!}} International {{!}} Business|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing Feeds===
Dialog was criticised for changing the feed of [[Star Movies]] to the Indian feed and [[Cartoon Network (Southeast Asia)|Cartoon Network Asia]] to the [[Cartoon Network (Pakistan)|Pakistani feed]]. On 4 August 2018, Dialog switched the Indian feeds of Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. to the Asian feeds.

'''ENMTP''' (from '''Entreprise Nationale des Materiels de Travaux Publics''' ) is an [[Algeria]]n company specializing in the development, manufacture and distribution of machinery used in public works. It has registered capital of 15.6 billion DA and is 100% owned by the state.

Following the restructuring of the [[Sonacome]] and SN METAL, the National Company of heavy equipment "ENMTP" was transformed into joint stock company in 1995.

The ENMTP Group produced materials under licenses acquired from recognized manufacturers, such as:

[[Liebherr Group|Liebherr]] (Germany) for excavators, cranes, bulldozers and large shippers
[[Orenstein &amp; Koppel|O &amp; K]] (Germany) for loaders
INGERSOLL RAND CO (United States) in the field of compressors and compactors
[[Manitowoc Cranes|POTAIN]] (United States) for the production of building cranes
[[Manitou (entreprise)|Braud &amp; Faucheux]] for manufacturing concrete mixers
and materials developed with the company's internal skills: backhoe loaders, Graders, BTS Press and various small products

The industrial potential of ENMTP Group is considered one of the largest in Africa. It is structured according to specialization by product lines. Each unit have the largest industrial autonomy.

* Public works equipments ([[Excavators]], [[Hydraulic]] [[Crane (machine)|Cranes]], [[Loader (equipment)|Loaders]], [[Bulldozers]]…) 
* [[Compactors]] and [[compressors]] 
* [[Concrete]] equipments.
 
The ENMTP restructuring strategy grants a leading part to partnership with [[nation]]al or [[international]] operators, irrespective of their legal status.
Whatever the option, what matters most is that it achieves the desired targets:

*-Developing competitive products 
*-Expanding distribution channels, notably abroad 
*-Securing technological "know how".

==Partnership==

'''''Elves' Hill''''' ({{lang-da|Elverhøj}}) is a [[comedy]] by [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]], with overture and incidental music by [[Friedrich Kuhlau]] (Op. 100), which is considered the first Danish national play.

''Elves' Hill'' was commissioned by [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederik VI]] for the wedding of his daughter [[Princess Vilhelmine Marie of Denmark|Vilhelmine Marie]] and Frederik Carl Christian (later [[Frederik VII of Denmark|Frederik VII]]) and premiered on November 6, 1828, 5 days after the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shore|2008|pp=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Møller|first=Kristian Langdal|title= H.

Gang 5 Dage efter Brylluppet"; Reprinted in: [Strejflys over hans Liv og hans Digtning] (1968), p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the premiere, the play has been performed more than 1,000 times at the [[Royal Danish Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wamberg|first=Niels Birger|title=H. C. Andersen og Heiberg|publisher=Politiken|year=1971|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdrkAAAAMAAJ|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work incorporated both the texts and melodies of two traditional ballad pieces featuring folklore about the Elven king. Heiberg localized the legend of the Elven king to [[Stevns Municipality|Stevns]].&lt;ref name="kuhn095"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kuhn|2000|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; To these, the motif element of the [[Changeling|swapped children]] was added. King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] is cast as a sort of detective, who unravels the mystery.

These ballads had appeared in ''Udvalgte Danske Viser fra Middelalderen'' (1812), edited by {{Interlanguage link multi|Werner Abrahamson|2=da|3=Werner Abrahamson|preserve=1}}.&lt;ref name="kuhn095"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shore|2008|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Abrahamson|editor-first=Werner Hans Frederik|title=Udvalgte danske viser fra middelalderen|volume=1|publisher=F.F.

Elvehøj, p.105-; 47.Elveskud, p. 109-|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gIzkAAAAMAAJpg=PA105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work also contains "[[Kong Christian stod ved højen mast]]", which became the royal anthem of Denmark. It is set to Kuhlau's arrangement to a tune already being sung to the lyrics originally written by [[Johannes Ewald]] for an entirely different play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shore|2008|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; However ''Elves' Hill'' is considered instrumental to the romantic popularity of the anthem.

== In popular culture ==
In the eighth ''[[Olsen-banden]]'' movie (''[[Olsen-banden ser rødt]]''), the Olsen gang bombs, drills, and hammers its way through an opera house's basement in synchronicity with the music of the ''Elverhøj Overture''.

The '''Embassy of Turkey to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus''' ({{lang-tr| Türkiye'nin Kuzey Kıbrıs Türk Cumhuriyeti Büyükelçiliği}}) is located in the Turkish Sector of [[Nicosia]], just outside the walls of the Old City. It is unique in all of the foreign diplomatic missions located in Nicosia in that it is officially accredited to the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC), rather than the internationally recognized [[Republic of Cyprus]] (what Turkey refers to as the [[Greek Cypriot Administration of South Cyprus]] as Turkey does not recognize the Greek Cypriot Republic as a legitimate entity).

The embassy was established in November 1983, shortly after the TRNC's [[Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|Declaration of Independence]]. It is located just across the street from the TRNC Parliament Building.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2431">[[File:Flag of Barcelona.svg|thumb|300px|right|Current official flag&lt;br/&gt;Flag ratio: 2:3]]

The current '''flag of [[Barcelona]]''' combines the [[St George's Cross|cross of Saint George]] (in Catalan, ''Sant Jordi''), the patron saint of Catalonia, with the traditional red and yellow bars of the [[Senyera]], the ancient symbol of the [[Crown of Aragon]] (here, the bars are vertical, though the modern [[Senyera|flag of Catalonia]] has horizontal stripes).

The flag in its current form has been official since 2004, though it (or variations on it) may have been in use since the nineteenth century. It was first officially adopted in May 1906, but its use was not permitted during the rule of [[General Franco]]; a slightly different version of the flag, with brighter colours and a different configuration of red bars, was readopted in 1984.

[[File:Bandera de Barcelona de 1996.svg|thumb|right|Flag adopted by the City Council between 1996 and 2004&lt;br /&gt;Flag ratio: 2:3]]
In 1996, after a number of different proposals, the city council of Barcelona adopted a new flag, featuring the official logo of the city (which incorporates St. George's cross) over the vertical Catalan stripes. The flag enjoyed some political support, but was opposed by some historical and [[Vexillology|vexillological]] groups, who campaigned against it.

In 2004, however, the city council "recuperated" the 1906 flag legislation, restoring the original design. Both the traditional (1906) and the modern (1996) designs can be seen today in the city, though the Catalan Vexillology Association (''Associació Catalana de Vexil·lologia'') continues to campaign against the use of the latter.

'''For Yugoslavia''' ({{lang-sr|За Југославију/Za Jugoslaviju}}) was a [[political alliance]] that existed in the [[Republic of Montenegro (1992–2006)|Republic of Montenegro]] from the late 1990s to 2001. It was led by [[Momir Bulatović]]'s SNP and based on pro-[[Miloševićism]]. It emphasized the necessity to maintain the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], the state union of [[Serbia and Montenegro]].

It was composed by:
* [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro]] (SNP)
* [[Yugoslav Left]] (JUL)
* [[Serbian People's Party of Montenegro]] (SNS)
* [[Serbian Radical Party]] (SRS)

With the purge within SNP when its entire pro-Momirist leadership left and founded the People's Socialist Party, SNP broke away from its pro-Milošević partners and formed the [[Together for Yugoslavia]] Alliance which managed to maintain a stalwart opposition.

Bulatović's supporters founded a pro-Milošević bloc known as the [[Patriotic Coalition for Yugoslavia]] that succeeded the For Yugoslavia alliance.

The '''Franco-British Council''' is an organisation created on the joint initiative of President [[Georges Pompidou]] and Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] in order to promote better understanding between [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] and to contribute to the development of joint action through meetings of leading representatives of the worlds of culture, science, education, politics and business in the context of a developing Europe and of an increasingly globalised community.

== History ==
In [[Paris]] in May 1971 the [[British Prime Minister]], [[Edward Heath]], met the [[French President]], [[Georges Pompidou]], for the discussions to pave the way for Britain's entry into the [[European Community]]. At this meeting, they reflected on the way in which contact between the two countries could be widened beyond the existing official mechanism for the exchange of ideas and information between the two governments. They concluded that there was a need for a non-governmental body which could sponsor seminars and colloques between people of like interests in the two countries. These meetings should not be confined just to cultural or educational matters, but aim to cover all fields where the two countries shared common problems, or could benefit from a better understanding of the others position.

On 16 May 1972, during the Queen's visit to Paris, an official communiqué was issued announcing the establishment of a Comite d'lnitiative franco-britannique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francobritishcouncil.org.uk/pages/history/|title=Franco-British Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===40th Anniversary and beyond===
In 2013, the Franco-British Council celebrated its 40th anniversary with an event at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] called 'Making the case for Europe'. The event featured a speech by the Rt Hon [[David Lidington]] MP, the [[Minister for Europe]], as well as his French counterpart, Thierry Renpentin. Mr Lidington praised the FBC for being an organisation "which has been working tirelessly for the past four decades forging links across the Channel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/minister-for-europe-speech-at-the-franco-british-council|title=Minister for Europe speech at the Franco-British Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same event, Thierry Renpentin described the FBC " 'as a “bridge.' A bridge between our political classes, a bridge between our economic players and, above all, a bridge between our two civil societies.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/Europe-Minister-talks-to-Franco/|title=Europe Minister talks to 40-year-old Franco-British Council|work=France in the United Kingdom - La France au Royaume-Uni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Edward Leigh]] member of the Franco-British Council urged for closer co-operation between France and Britain in immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnshireecho.co.uk/End-Calais-illegal-immigrants-crisis-Lincolnshire/story-27543019-detail/story.html|title='End Calais illegal immigrants crisis now,|work=Lincolnshire Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, [[Dominic Grieve]] told the council [[David Cameron]]'s plan to alter human right legislation would make the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] "inoperable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-says-his-plan-to-scrap-the-human-rights-act-will-restore-magna-cartas-legacy-10320232.html|title=Scrapping the Human Rights Act will 'restore' Magna Carta's legacy,|date=15 June 2015|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The Council organises a programme of specialised meetings on a variety of subjects under the broad headings of:

* environment, energy and sustainable development
* economic reform in the context of European developments and glhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-says-his-plan-to-scrap-the-human-rights-act-will-restore-magna-cartas-legacy-10320232.htmlobalisation
* social cohesion and immigration
* culture including the arts, heritage and new media
 
The seminars bring together leading professionals who are encouraged to develop bilateral networks. The Council also publishes reports of the meetings, for the benefit both of the participants themselves and of policy makers in the two countries. Competitions exist to promote France and French to a younger age group.

=== Defence ===
Each year, the Franco-British defence conference brings together government people, senior military,  industrialists, think tankers, academics and journalists on a set of issues affecting both nations and how they can work together to be better. 

In 2012, [[Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology]] [[Peter Luff]] gave a speech saying "Defence is central to the values the UK and France share."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/2012-03-21-franco-british-council-2012-defence-conference|title=2012/03/21 - Franco-British Council 2012 Defence Conference|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, HE [[Sir Peter Ricketts]], [[British Ambassador to France]], described the conference as having "showed the value of an organisation like the Franco-British Council, who can convene people from a wider sphere perhaps than two governments would to contribute to the debate that we’re having."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/peterricketts/2014/04/07/defence-cooperation-and-the-franco-british-council/|title=Defence Cooperation and the Franco-British Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
Basic funding is provided by the two governments, but the Council aims to supplement this for specific projects, with contributions from other sources. In its management of funds, the Council is guided by its Trustees, by its Memorandum of Understanding and by its charitable status, and is independent of government.

== Organisation ==
=== Secretary-General ===
The Council is run by Secretary-General Ann Kenrick CBE. Following fifteen years in the private sector selling Hydro Electric Plants to West Africa and managing top Information Technology Accounts at IBM, Ann has been running the British Section of the FBC for 20 years. In 2015 she received the [[Legion of Honour|Honour of the Chevalier de L'ordre national du Merite]] for her outstanding work in bringing France and Britain together over the past two decades. 

In addition to her interest in Franco-British relations she has also developed a strong portfolio in the Environmental Transport arena as Chair of the London Cycling Campaign and founder/chair of a South London Safe Routes to School group.

She has chaired and spoken at many travel conferences and has published Let Me Out!; How to enjoy the school run, a book to encourage parents to let their children walk and bike to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francobritishcouncil.org.uk/members.php?action=view&amp;id=28/|title=Members · About the Franco-British Council · Franco-British Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chair ===
The Chair is formally appointed by the Foreign Secretary and serves a maximum four years. Rt Hon [[Baroness Quin]] of Gateshead, Former Minister for Europe, stepped down in March 2013 after a highly successful four years as chair. The new Chair is Rt Hon [[Baroness Blackstone]], former Opposition Spokeswoman on Foreign Affairs in the House of Lords.

=== Trustees ===
A board of trustees oversee the work of the Council. Trustees are selected from the membership and serve a maximum of six years. A full board of trustees is available on the official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francobritishcouncil.org.uk/members.php?action=trustees/|title=Members|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It sided with [[Vichy France]] and was sunk by off [[Libreville]] by its sister ship {{ship|French aviso|Savorgnan de Brazza||2}} on 9 November 1940 in the [[Battle of Gabon]]. Although refloated in March 1941, ''Bougainville'' sank again and was finally broken up in 1952.&lt;ref name="JMR" /&gt;

'''Gallo-Roman religion''' was a fusion of the traditional religious practices of the [[Gauls]], who were originally [[Gaulish language|Celtic]] speakers, and the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman and Hellenistic religions]] introduced to the region under [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial rule]]. It was the result of selective [[acculturation]].

}}

==Deities==
In some cases, Gaulish deity names were used as epithets for [[List of Roman deities|Roman deities]], and vice versa, as with [[Lenus|Lenus Mars]] or [[Poeninus|Jupiter Poeninus]]. In other cases, Roman gods were given Gaulish female partners – for example, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] was paired with [[Rosmerta]] and [[Sirona]] was partnered with [[Apollo]]. In at least one case – that of the equine goddess [[Epona]] – a native Celtic goddess was also adopted by Romans.

The [[Jupiter Column]] was a distinctive type of religious monument from Roman Gaul and Germania, combining an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] Jupiter overcoming a giant (or sometimes Jupiter enthroned) with panels depicting many other deities.

Eastern [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]]s penetrated Gaul early on. These included the cults of [[Orpheus]], [[Mithras]], [[Cybele]], and [[Isis]]. The [[imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]], centred primarily on the ''[[numen]]'' of [[Augustus]], came to play a prominent role in the public religion of Gaul, most dramatically at the [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls]] at [[Lugdunum]].

==Practices==
Roman religious practices such as offerings of [[incense]] and [[animal sacrifice]], dedicatory [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]], and naturalistic statuary depicting deities in [[anthropomorphic]] form were combined with specific Gaulish practices such as [[:wikt:circumambulation|circumambulation]] around a temple. This gave rise to a characteristic Gallo-Roman [[fanum]], identifiable in archaeology from its [[concentric]] shape.

'''"Hengaillaan"''' ("Let's hang around") was the [[Finland|Finnish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984]], performed in [[Finnish Language|Finnish]] by [[Kirka]].

The song was performed sixteenth on the night, following [[Turkey]]'s [[Beş Yıl Önce, On Yıl Sonra]] with "[[Halay (song)|Halay]]" and preceding [[Switzerland]]'s [[Rainy Day (band)|Rainy Day]] with "[[Welche Farbe hat der Sonnenschein?]]". At the close of voting, it had received 46 points, placing 9th in a field of 19.

The song is one of the biggest hits of Kirka. Though Kirka's career as a singer began in 1967, the LP-album called "Hengaillaan" was his first album which sold gold in Finland. The song is still very popular also in Finnish karaokebars and in "finnhits"-discos.

The song is sung as a suggestion to a fellow traveller that, instead of finding accommodation for the night, the pair "hang around the [train] station" until the morning - when their train leaves at 5:30am. Ultimately, however, they miss that train as well. Kirka also recorded the song in English, then under the title "C'mon Let's Boogie".

It was succeeded as [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Finnish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985 Contest]] by [[Sonja Lumme]] with "[[Eläköön elämä]]".

{{Socialism sidebar}}
'''Internationalist''' and '''defencist''' were the broad opposing camps in the international socialist movement during and shortly after the [[First World War]]. Prior to 1914, anti-militarism had been an article of faith among most European socialist parties. Leaders of the [[Second International]] had even suggested that socialist workers might foil a declaration of war by means of a general strike.

However, when war broke out in August 1914, the leaders of most European socialist parties rallied to the support of their respective countries, while a minority continued to oppose the war. Those in favour of their country's war efforts were variously called 'social patriots' or 'defencists'. Those opposed to the war called themselves 'Internationalists' and were often called 'defeatists' by their opponents.

== Division ==
The 'defencist' camp included many venerable figures of European socialism: [[Jules Guesde]] and [[Édouard Vaillant]] in France, [[Gustav Noske]] and [[Friedrich Ebert]] in Germany, [[Georgi Plekhanov]] and [[Ekaterina Breshkovskaia]] among the Russians. Leaders of the anti-war 'Internationalist' camp included [[Jean Jaurès]] (who was murdered for his anti-war stance in 1914), [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], and later also [[Karl Kautsky]] and [[Eduard Bernstein]], in Germany, [[Julius Martov|Iulii Martov]], [[V.I. Lenin|Vladimir Lenin]], [[Viktor Chernov]] and [[Mark Natanson]] among the Russians. The anti-war socialists held two international conferences at [[Zimmerwald Conference|Zimmerwald]] and [[Kienthal Conference|Kienthal]] in Switzerland in 1915 and 1916.

The defencist–internationalist schism did not necessarily coincide with earlier, pre-existing splits, such as that between reformists and revolutionaries, Revisionists and orthodox Marxists, [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]], etc. For example, Guesde and Vaillant in France had belonged to the intransigent, revolutionary left of the [[SFIO Party|Socialist Party]], and in 1914, anti-war sentiment was strongest on the far left. Yet both of these veterans were ardent supporters of the French war effort, while the old reformist leader Jaurès opposed the war. Likewise, Kautsky and Bernstein had been on opposite sides during the Revisionism controversy of the 1890s, Kautsky defending orthodox Marxism and Bernstein being the principal exponent of Revisionism; they both joined the anti-war faction. Meanwhile the left wing Marxists [[Paul Lensch]], [[Heinrich Cunow]] and [[Konrad Haenisch]] went on to form the [[Lensch-Cunow-Haenisch group]], which argued that the First World War was a revolutionary war against the liberal capitalism of the [[Triple Entente]].

'Defencism' and 'Internationalism' were broad categories; within each camp, there were further differences and divisions. Out-and-out 'Social Patriots' who supported their countries' war efforts unconditionally, including territorial ambitions, were fairly rare, though they included some of the most prominent representatives of the pre-war socialist movement: people like [[Henry Hyndman]], Plekhanov and Guesde. More common was an attitude of conditional support for the war, approving a 'defensive' war but rejecting annexations and indemnities. A special case arose in Russia in 1917: After the [[February Revolution]], several [[Mensheviks]] and [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist-Revolutionaries]] (SRs) who had previously been Internationalists and Zimmerwaldists now favoured 'Revolutionary Defencism' – continued war effort in defence of the revolution. This was the case with Mensheviks like [[Fyodor Dan|Fedor Dan]] and [[Irakli Tsereteli]], SRs like [[Avram Gots]] and [[Nikolai Avksentiev]] and [[Trudoviks]] like [[Alexander Kerensky]]. In 1917 some Bolsheviks took also this position, before Lenin returned to Russia and successfully opposed this view. On the Internationalist side, too, there were divisions. Most Internationalists favoured passive resistance to the war and called for an international peace agreement, 'without annexations or indemnities'. Jaurès, Kautsky, Bernstein, Martov and Chernov belonged to this camp; so, at first, did the Bolshevik [[Lev Kamenev]]. A minority led by Lenin advocated 'Revolutionary Defeatism': instead of seeking a peace agreement that would restore the ''status quo ante'', socialists should seek to convert the 'imperialist war' into a revolutionary 'civil war', with each socialist party working for the defeat of its own country.

== Effects by country ==
The schism caused splits in many European socialist parties. In France, the split between socialists and communists did not occur until 1920. In Germany, the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social-Democrats]] (USPD) formally separated from the majority [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in 1917, and the more radical [[Spartacist League]] formed the nucleus of the post-war [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] (KPD). Italy was a special case: whereas, in most European socialist parties, Defencists predominated (at least at the beginning of the war), in Italy, the majority of the members and most of the leaders of the [[Socialist Party of Italy|Socialist Party]], from reformists to radicals, were against Italy's entry into the war, while a minority, led by the former Maximalist and future [[fascist]] dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], campaigned for Italian intervention and was expelled from the party for it. Only the Serbian socialists remained fairly uniformly anti-war.

=== Russia ===
Divisions in Russia were especially complicated and affected party alignments during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries were badly divided. A small minority on the right took an out-and-out Social Patriotic stance, even supporting territorial expansion as a war aim. Plekhanov and the 'Grandmother of the Revolution, Breshkovskaia, belonged to this group. Slightly more moderate were Mensheviks like [[Aleksandr Potresov]] and SRs like [[Vadim Rudnev]]. The Menshevik and SR majority, including Dan, Tsereteli, [[Raphael Abramovitch|Abramovich]], [[Mikhail Liber|Liber]], Gots, Avksentiev, [[Vladimir Zenzinov|Zenzinov]] and so on, were 'Revolutionary Defencists'; they had been Zimmerwaldists and opponents of the war until February 1917 but now favoured limited defensive war.

Some later returned to the Internationalist camp (such as Dan and Abramovich). The Revolutionary Defencists dominated the soviets and the Provisional Government until the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. The Menshevik/SR Revolutionary Defencists in the soviet supported the Provisional Government, but with increasing misgivings. Kerensky had been one of them, a Zimmerwaldist until 1917, then a Revolutionary Defencist; however, as, initially, the only socialist in the Provisional Government, he had adopted a more and more unqualified stance in support of the war, in line with his liberal colleagues.

To the left of the revolutionary defencists stood Internationalists like Chernov, who collaborated with the soviet leaders and even joined the Provisional Government, although he opposed both a continuation of the war and a coalition with the liberals. More principled in his opposition to the war was the Menshevik Internationalist leader Martov, who, however, was in a minority in his party until the Bolsheviks had taken power. The [[Mezhraiontsy]] group, headed by [[Leon Trotsky]], was firmly internationalist but not necessarily revolutionary defeatist; in 1918, Trotsky resigned his ministry rather than sign the harsh peace agreement of Brest-Litovsk proposed by the Germans.

The [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], who counted the veteran [[Mark Natanson]] and many young militants among their number, were also firmly Internationalist but broke their short-lived coalition with the Bolsheviks when the latter signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. The Bolsheviks were fairly united in opposing the war, but not all Bolsheviks were comfortable with Lenin's Revolutionary Defeatism. Before Lenin's return to Russia, [[Joseph Stalin]] had even briefly adopted a Revolutionary Defencist position. Divisions over the war vitiated the attempts occasionally made, both before and after the October Revolution, to set up an all-socialist government, from the Bolsheviks to the [[Popular Socialists (Russia)|Popular Socialists]].

== Post-war impact ==
After World War I was over, divisions over the war could not be healed. Many internationalists wanted nothing to do with the Defencist leaders of the old [[Second International]]. Some affiliated with Lenin's communist [[Third International]]. A minority, who opposed both communism and the [[Second International]] leadership, formed the [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties]], based in Vienna and known as the 'Second-and-a-Half International'. This included many former Internationalists, German Independent Social-Democrats like [[Rudolf Hilferding]], Austro-Marxists like [[Max Adler (Marxist)|Max]] and [[Friedrich Adler (assassin)|Friedrich Adler]], Mensheviks like Dan, centre-left SRs like Chernov and the Left SRs. Eventually this third camp dissolved; some rejoined the majority socialist parties of their countries, others the communists. The split between Defencists and Internationalists continued to fester, however, until the [[Second World War]] was on the horizon.

A belated echo of the split was the division among French socialists in the late 1930s over what attitude to take if Hitler invaded Poland. Most French socialists were firmly anti-fascist; though none contemplated the prospect of another war with Germany with joy, they were prepared to take that step if Germany attacked Poland. A minority, however, wanted to maintain peace at any cost. Some were motivated by unconditional pacifism, others by fascist sympathies which subsequently manifested themselves, as in the case of the ex-socialist and future premier of the Vichy régime, [[Pierre Laval]].

'''Jamila''' ({{lang-ru|Джамиля}} {{IPA-ru|dʐəmʲɪˈlʲa|}}, {{lang-ky|Жамила}}, ''Jamila'', {{IPA-ky|d͡ʒɑmiːˈlɑ|}}) is the first major novel by [[Chingiz Aitmatov|Chingiz Aytmatov]], published originally in [[Russian language|Russian]] in 1958. The novel is told from the point of view of a fictional [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] artist, Seit, who tells the story by looking back on his childhood. The story recounts the love between his new sister-in-law Jamilya and a local crippled young man, Daniyar, while Jamilya's husband, Sadyk, is "away at the front" (as a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[soldier]] during [[World War II]]).

Based on clues in the story, it takes place in northwestern [[Kyrgyzstan]], presumably [[Talas Province]]. The story is backdropped against the [[collective farming]] culture which was early in its peak in that period.

[[Louis Aragon]] lauded the novelette as the "world's most beautiful love story".&lt;ref&gt;Erich Follath and Christian Neef, "[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,druck-720631,00.html Kyrgyzstan Has Become an Ungovernable Country]", ''[[Der Spiegel|SPIEGEL ONLINE International]]'', 8 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kapsiki''' (Ka-Tsepkye) is a people living on both sides of the border between North [[Cameroon]] and Northeast [[Nigeria]].  They are called Kapsiki in Cameroon, and '''Higi''' in Nigeria. Together they amount to about 120,000 people. Their language, Psekiye or Kamwe, consists of eleven dialects including Nkafa, Sina, Ghye, Humsi, Dakwa and Tilli and belongs to the Chadic language family. In Cameroon, the Kapsiki live on a plateau in the [[Far North Province]] in the center of the [[Mandara Mountains]] and are considered one of Cameroon's [[Kirdi]] (''[[pagan]]'') ethnic groups due to their resistance to [[Islam]]isation during the [[Fulani]] jihad of [[Modibo Adama]] and Hama Yaji.
In Nigeria, the Higi lives on the slopes of the mountains and the western plain. The Kapsiki have been living in this area for five centuries, long before the great slave hunts of the 19th century, but by this isolated habitat they have been able to maintain themselves against the [[Fulbe]]. This also applies to the other peoples of Mandara region, such as the Mafa, Mofu, Podoko Guisiga, or Daba. The mountain region has a kaleidoscope of local cultures. The Kapsiki live in villages of 2000-6000 people, and subsist on livestock farming, agriculture and - in the village of Rumsiki in particular - on tourism.

[[Laos]] is a [[landlocked country]] in the heart of the Indochinese peninsula of [[Mainland Southeast Asia]], bordered by [[Myanmar|Myanmar (Burma)]] and [[China]] to the northwest, [[Vietnam]] to the east, [[Cambodia]] to the southwest, and [[Thailand]] to the west and southwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.na.gov.la/appf17/geography.html|title=ABOUT LAOS: GEOGRAPHY|website=Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum|publisher=Government of Laos|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laos' ambitious strategies for development are based on generating electricity from its rivers and selling the power to its neighbors, namely [[Thailand]], [[China]], and [[Vietnam]], as well as its initiative to become a 'land-linked' nation, shown by the [[Transport in Laos#Railways|planning of four new railways connecting Laos to those same countries]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Laos approves Xayaburi 'mega' dam on Mekong |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20203072 |newspaper=BBC News |date=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, along with growth of the mining sector, Laos has been referred to as one of East Asia and Pacific's fastest growing economies by the [[World Bank]], with annual GDP growth averaging 7% for the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/lao/overview|title=Lao PDR [Overview]|publisher=World Bank|date=September 2016|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2d309312-1cb3-11e0-a106-00144feab49a.html#axzz1BP9Somjj |title = Laos Securities Exchange to start trading |publisher = Ft.com |date = 10 January 2011 |accessdate = 23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a member of the [[Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement]] (APTA), [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), [[East Asia Summit]] and [[La Francophonie]]. Laos applied for membership of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 1997; on 2 February 2013, it was granted full membership.&lt;ref name="wto"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/lao_e.htm | title=Lao People’s Democratic Republic and the WTO | publisher=World Trade Organization | accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Norwegian Society of Engineers and Technologists''' (NITO) is the largest [[trade union|union]] in [[engineering]] in [[Norway]] with approximately 72 000 members. NITO has 21 regional branches covering the country and over 2,000 local clubs and shop stewards. Most of the working members are affiliated to a local club.

NITO is led by a Board of Representatives. The daily work of the union is carried out by shop stewards and elected union representatives at different organisational levels; by the secretariat and main office in [[Oslo]], consisting of the General Secretary and 75 employees; and by the 23 employees who run the branch offices.

The member spread is as follows:
* Private sector: approximately 25,200
* Local and county authorities, local electricity boards: approximately 5,700
* NAVO Health sector: approximately 4,600
* Civil Service: approximately 4,300

'''Parex Banka''' was founded in 1992 by [[Valery Kargin]] and Viktor Krasovickis as a privately owned full-service banking company in [[Riga, Latvia]]. Its services were marketed both locally and to international clients in both the West and [[Russia]].

Much of Parex's lending took place within the [[Baltic states]], leaving it relatively insulated from the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]]. The years immediately after Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the [[European Union]] in 2004 brought an influx of foreign investment, leading to an overheated economy, unsustainable economic growth and a [[Baltic states housing bubble|real estate bubble]] which burst during the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]]. The September 15, 2008 failure of US bank [[Lehman Brothers]] led to a sharp drop in liquidity and international investors began to withdraw assets.

51% majority control of Parex was purchased from the two founders by the Latvian government on November 8, 2008 for a token consideration of 2 Latvian [[Latvian lats|lats]]. The government later enlarged its stake in Parex by buying out other stockholders for a token €0.01/share, then split the institution into good and [[bad bank]]s:

* [[Citadele banka]] was spun off on August 1, 2010 as a good bank&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/26699/&lt;/ref&gt;
* The remaining troubled assets remained with Parex Banka, which became asset management company [[Reverta]] in 2012.

The total direct and indirect cost to the Latvian government is estimated at more than a billion dollars,{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} making it a factor in a [[2008–2010 Latvian financial crisis]] which forced the state to borrow money from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[European Commission]] to cover a balance of payments deficit.

'''Radio Centraal''' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] "underground" radio station in the old city center of [[Antwerp]]. 
It began broadcasting on 31 October 1980 as one of the first [[pirate radio]] stations which started around the country in protest against the broadcasting monopoly of the national state networks. It always was and still remains an independent radio project with many experimental programmes and niche music. The station is structured as a non-for-profit organisation. The contributors are all volunteers and all the on-air talent finance the investment and cover the running costs of the project. In this way, Radio Centraal can stay independent from local government or commercial sponsors. Most programming is in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], but there are many programmes in English and other languages.
The station offers a starting platform for aspiring, ambitious and creative radio broadcasters, who are given licence to experiment in sound, editorial, music, reportage and language. Several have gone on to careers in the Belgian national media. Original founder members such as [[Jan Balliauw]] and [[Stefan Blommaert]] now work at [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]] television as international correspondents.

Since the studio is located close to the [[Het Steen|Steen]] on the river front boulevard, Radio Centraal can be said to have its fingers on the pulse of a living city. It has organised and supported many inner city cultural activities, parties and "art" radio projects over the years.
