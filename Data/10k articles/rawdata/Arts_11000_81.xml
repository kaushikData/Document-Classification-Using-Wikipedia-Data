      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24011">An '''album cover''' is the front of the packaging of a commercially released audio recording product, or [[album]]. The term can refer to either the printed cardboard covers typically used to package sets of {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} 78-rpm records, single and sets of {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} [[LP record|LP]]s, sets of 45 rpm records (either in several connected sleeves or a box), or the front-facing panel of a [[compact disc|CD]] [[optical disc packaging|package]], and, increasingly, the primary image accompanying a [[music download|digital download]] of the album, or of its individual [[Track (CD)|tracks]].

In the case of all types of tangible records, it also serves as part of the protective sleeve.

== Early history ==
Around 1910, 78-rpm records replaced the [[phonograph cylinder]] as the medium for recorded sound. The 78-rpm records were issued in both 10- and 12-inch diameter sizes and were usually sold separately, in brown paper or cardboard sleeves that were sometimes plain and sometimes printed to show the producer or the retailer's name. These were invariably made out of acid paper, limiting conservability. Generally the sleeves had a circular cutout allowing the record label to be seen. Records could be laid on a shelf horizontally or stood upright on an edge, but because of their fragility, many broke in storage.

German record company [[Odeon Records|Odeon]] pioneered the "album" in 1909 when it released the ''[[Nutcracker Suite]]'' by [[Tchaikovsky]] on four double-sided discs in a specially designed package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/notes.html#cylinder | title= Recording Technology History | date= 6 July 2005 | first= Steve |last= Schoenherr | publisher= [[University of San Diego]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070329065002/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/notes.html#cylinder | archivedate= 29 March 2007 | accessdate= 27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is not indicated what the specially designed package was.) The practice of issuing albums does not seem to have been taken up by other record companies for many years.

Beginning in the 1920s, bound collections of empty sleeves with a plain [[paperboard]] or [[leather]] cover were sold as "[[record albums]]" (similar to a photograph album) that customers could use to store their records. (The name "record album" was printed on some covers.) These empty albums were sold in both 10- and 12-inch sizes.&lt;ref name=personal&gt;Example in personal collection.&lt;/ref&gt; The covers of these bound books were wider and taller than the records inside, allowing the record album to be placed on a shelf upright, like a book, and suspending the fragile records above the shelf, protecting them.

Starting in the 1930s, record companies began issuing collections of 78-rpm records by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled collections. These albums of several 78-rpm records could include a collection of popular songs related by either performer or style, or extended-length [[classical music]], including complete symphonies.&lt;ref name=personal /&gt;

In 1938, [[Columbia Records]] hired [[Alex Steinweiss]] as its first [[art director]]. He is credited with inventing the concept of album covers and [[Cover art#Album cover art|cover art]], replacing the plain covers used before. After his initial efforts at Columbia, other record companies followed his lead. By the late 1940s, record albums for all the major companies featured their own colorful paper covers in both 10- and 12-inch sizes. Some featured reproductions of classic art while others utilized original designs.

When the 10- and 12-inch long-playing records ([[LP record|LP]]s) came along in 1948, and box sets of 45-rpm records soon followed (see [[gramophone record]]), the name "album" was used for the new format of collections, and the creation of artistic original album covers continued.

== Formats ==
From the 1950s through to the 1980s, the 12" LP record and the 45 rpm record became the major formats for the distribution of [[popular music]]. The LP format remains in use  for occasional new releases, though other formats have largely supplanted it. The size of the typical cardboard LP sleeve cover is {{convert|12.375|in|cm|abbr=on}} square.

Since the mid-1990s, the [[compact disc]] (CD) has become the most common form of physically-distributed music products. [[Optical disc packaging|Packaging formats]] vary, including the jewel case (which since 1982 has been the most popular form of CD packaging), and the cardboard and plastic combination commonly known as a [[Digipak]] (which has been a popular alternative form of packaging in recent years, but remains supplanted by the jewel case due to higher manufacturing costs and lower durability). Typically the album cover component of these packages is approximately {{convert|4.75|in|cm|abbr=on}} square.

== Design ==

The Album Art Cover with eyecatching illustration, vibrant colours and lettering, is generally attributed to the American designer Alex Steinweiss in the 1950s.
{{see also|Cover art#Album cover art}}
The cover became an important part of the culture of music.&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Doggett|year=2015|title=Electric Shock: From the Gramophone to the iPhone: 125 Years of Pop Music |publisher=The Bodley Head|location=London|isbn=978-1-847922182|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of designers like [[Bob Cato]],{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} who at various stages in his long music career was vice president of creative services at both [[Columbia Records]] and [[United Artists]], album covers became renowned for being a marketing tool and an expression of artistic intent.&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393" /&gt; Album art has also been discussed as an important postwar cultural expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958205262|title=Designed for hi-fi living : the vinyl LP in midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962-|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=|oclc=958205262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1960s, [[the Beatles]]' ''[[With the Beatles]]'', [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]'' and [[the Rolling Stones]]' [[The Rolling Stones (album)|self-titled debut album]] each contained a cover photograph designed to further the musical artist's public image. Author [[Peter Doggett]] also highlights the cover of [[Otis Redding]]'s ''[[Otis Blue]]'', containing a photo of a young white woman, as a design that "played a dual role: she represented the transcendent power of the music, and obscured the race of its creator."&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393" /&gt; The standard portrait-based LP cover was further challenged over 1965–66 by Dylan's ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'', through the inclusion of symbolic artefacts around the singer; the artificially stretched faces of the Beatles shown on their ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album; and the darkened hues applied to the Rolling Stones on ''[[Aftermath (The Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]''.&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393" /&gt;

[[Gatefold|Gatefold cover]]s (a folded double cover) and inserts, often with lyric sheets, made the album cover a desirable work in its own right. Notable examples are [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which had cut-out inserts, printed lyrics, and a gatefold sleeve, even though it was a single album; [[the Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'', which had a gatefold and a series of 12 perforated postcards as inserts (taken by photographer [[Norman Seeff]]); and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', which had a gatefold, lyrics, no title on the sleeve, and poster and sticker inserts. [[The Band]]'s 1970 release ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'', which included a photograph by Seeff as a poster insert, is an early example of LP artwork quickly becoming a collector's item. The move to the small (less than 1/4 the size of a record) CD format lost that impact, although attempts have been made to create a more desirable packaging for the CD format, for example the reissue of ''Sgt. Pepper'', which had a cardboard box and booklet, or the use of oversized packaging.

The importance of design was such that some cover artists specialised or gained fame through their work. Such people include the design team [[Hipgnosis]], through their work on [[Pink Floyd]] albums, amongst others; [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]], famous for his [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Greenslade]] covers; [[Cal Schenkel]], for [[Captain Beefheart]]'s ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' and [[Frank Zappa]]'s ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]''.

The talents of many photographers and illustrators from both inside and outside of the music industry have been used to produce a vast array of memorable LP/CD covers. Photographer [[Mick Rock]] produced some of the most iconographic album covers of the 1970s, including [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s ''[[Queen II]]'' (recreated for their classic music video [[Bohemian Rhapsody]]), [[Syd Barrett]]'s ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'', and [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Transformer (album)|Transformer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6613107.stm Photographer lives the Rock dream] BBC News. Retrieved May 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; From 1972 to 1975, photographer [[Norman Seeff]] was Creative Director at [[United Artists]] and in addition to his many cover photographs ([[The Band]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]'s [[Hotter than Hell (album)|Hotter than Hell]], [[Joni Mitchell]]'s [[Hejira (album)|Hejira]] etc.), he art directed dozens of album covers including ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'', many of which received [[Grammy]] nominations. In addition to the examples mentioned previously, a number of world-renowned graphic artists and illustrators such as [[Ed Repka]] ([[Megadeth]]), [[Andy Warhol]] ([[The Velvet Underground]],&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John. (1987) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/Andy-Warhol-Velvet-Underground "Andy Warhol &amp; the Velvet Underground"]. In ''Cross-Overs: Art into Pop, Pop into Art'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Rolling Stones]]), [[Mati Klarwein]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Miles Davis]]), [[H. R. Giger]] ([[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]], [[Debbie Harry]]), [[Frank Frazetta]] ([[Molly Hatchet]]), [[Derek Riggs]] ([[Iron Maiden]]), [[Jamie Reid]] ([[The Sex Pistols]]), [[Howard Finster]] ([[R.E.M.]], [[Talking Heads]]), [[Al Hirschfeld]] ([[Aerosmith]]), [[Ken Kelly (artist)|Ken Kelly]] ([[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Manowar]]), [[Gottfried Helnwein]] ([[Marilyn Manson]]), [[Rex Ray]] ([[David Bowie]]), [[Robert Crumb]] ([[Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company]]), [[John Van Hamersveld]] (The Rolling Stones), and [[Shepard Fairey]] ([[Johnny Cash]]) have all applied their talents to memorable music packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/948670847|title=Total records : photography and the art of the album cover|others=Beaupré, Antoine de,, Vincendet, Serge,, Stourdzé, Sam,, Denis, Jacques,, Mondino, Jean-Baptiste, 1949-|isbn=9781597113847|edition=First Aperture|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=948670847}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/952207403|title=Art record covers|last=1978-|first=Spampinato, Francesco,|others=Wiedemann, Julius,|isbn=9783836540292|location=[Koln, Germany]|oclc=952207403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of record covers have also used images licensed (or borrowed from the public domain) from artists of bygone eras. Well-known examples of this include the cover of [[Derek and the Dominos]] ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (from the painting "La Fille au Bouquet" by French painter and sculptor [[Émile Théodore Frandsen de Schomberg]]), 'The Downfall of Icarus' by Genisson on the cover of the first album by [[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]]; [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]] on the cover of [[Deep Purple (album)|Deep Purple]]; [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Breugel]] on the cover of [[Fleet Foxes (album)|Fleet Foxes]]; the cover of Kansas's debut album, adapted from a mural by painter [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Norman Rockwell]]'s cowboy ([[Pure Prairie League]]), and, more recently, [[Coldplay]]'s ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends|Viva La Vida]]'', which features [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s painting ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (a favorite in [[The Louvre]]) with the words "VIVA LA VIDA" brushed on top in white paint.

Legends from photography and video/film who have also produced record cover images include [[Drew Struzan]] ([[Black Sabbath]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Iron Butterfly]], [[The Beach Boys]] and others), [[Annie Leibovitz]] ([[John Lennon]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Patti Smith]]), [[Richard Avedon]] ([[Whitney Houston]], [[Teddy Pendergrass]]), [[David LaChappelle]] ([[No Doubt]], [[Elton John]]), [[Anton Corbijn]] ([[U2]], [[The Killers]], [[Depeche Mode]]), [[Karl Ferris]] ([[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Donovan]], [[The Hollies]]), [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] ([[Patti Smith]], [[Peter Gabriel]]) and [[Francesco Scavullo]] ([[Diana Ross]], [[Edgar Winter]]), [[David Michael Kennedy]] others.

A number of artists and bands feature members who are, in their own right, accomplished illustrators, designers and photographers and whose talents are exhibited in the artwork they produced for their own recordings. Examples include [[Jimmy Page]] (''Led Zeppelin IV''), [[Chris Mars]] (Replacements' ''Pleased to Meet Me'' and others), [[Marilyn Manson]] (''Lest We Forget...''), [[Michael Stipe]] (REM's ''Accelerator''), [[Thom Yorke]] (credited as "Tchocky" on misc. [[Radiohead]] records), [[Michael Brecker]] (''Ringorama''), [[Freddie Mercury]] (''Queen I''), [[Lynsey De Paul]] (''Surprise''), [[John Entwistle]] (''Who By Numbers''), [[Graham Coxon]] (''13'' and most solo albums), [[Mike Shinoda]] (various [[Linkin Park]] albums), [[Joni Mitchell]] (''Miles of Aisles'' and several others) as well for [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]] (''So Far''), and [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]] (credited variously on [[Elastica]]'s ''The Menace'', her records), and [[Captain Beefheart]], 'Mona Bone Jakon', 'Tea for the Tillerman' and 'Teaser and the Firecat' by [[Cat Stevens]], [[Mika (singer)|Mika]] (all albums released to date), ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'' (for The Band), ''Self Portrait'' and ''Planet Waves'' by [[Bob Dylan]], ''Walls and Bridges'' by [[John Lennon]].

Album cover art was the subject of a 2013 documentary film, ''The Cover Story: Album Art'', by Eric Christensen, a [[San Francisco Bay Area]] record collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sam Whiting |url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Film-puts-lively-spin-on-album-cover-art-4209802.php#page-1 |title=Film puts lively spin on album cover art |publisher=SFGate |date=2013-01-20 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical design of album covers has been the subject of creative innovation. ''[[Ogden's Nut Gone Flake]]'' by the [[Small Faces]] was originally in a circular metal tin, and ''[[Happy to Meet – Sorry to Part]]'' by [[Horslips]] was in an octagonal package. [[Anyway (album)|Anyway]] by [[Family (band)|Family]] was originally issued in an opaque plastic package through which a design (a Leonardo sketch) could be seen. ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (album)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'' by the Beatles was first released as a double [[Extended play|EP]] with a booklet between the records. ''Sgt. Pepper'' contained a cardboard sheet of images, and ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (often referred to as the White Album) contained four large glossy photos of the individual Beatles along with a poster-sized collage. ''[[Live at Leeds]]'' by [[The Who]] also contained a generous supply of posters and printed material. ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' had a front cover that contained a revolving disc which brought different images into view through small cut-outs in the outer sleeve. A similar effect was used for the band's later album ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' with cut-outs of the windows of a brownstone building. The original issue of ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' by [[the Rolling Stones]] had an actual zipper incorporated into the picture of the crotch area of a pair of jeans. ''[[The Velvet Underground and Nico]]'' album had a Warhol-designed cardboard banana on the cover that could be peeled back. The record company [[Vertigo Records|Vertigo]] had a black-and-white design on the centre label that produced a hypnotic optical effect when the disc revolved on the turntable.

== Packaging ==
The album cover is a component of the overall packaging of an album. Especially in the case of vinyl records with paperboard  sleeves, these packages are prone to wear and tear, although wear and tear does often take place to some degree on covers contained within plastic cases. A variety of treatments could be applied to improve both their appearance and durability, such as clear plastic wrap. Many products have been available for the storage of vinyl albums, often clear plastic sleeves.

The surface of a vinyl record is readily damaged, so aside from the outer [[paperboard]] sleeve, there is usually an inner protective cover to protect against dust and handling. This is normally shaped to allow it to readily slide within the outer cover. The inner sleeve is either thin white paper, either plain or printed with information on other recordings available from the same company, or a paper sleeve supporting a thin [[plastic bag]]. These quite often have a circular cut out so that the record label can be read without directly handling the record, though when the inner sleeve is printed with lyrics, which became quite common, then there is usually no hole. Decca Records used a system of colour-coding on these sleeves where a blue color denoted a [[stereophonic sound|stereophonic]] recording while red denoted a [[Monaural|monophonic]] recording (the mono record players of the time were not always compatible with stereo records). This system was begun in the 1960s to reduce packaging costs.

[[Optical disc packaging|Packaging formats for compact discs]] widened the variety of presentations as well, even as the size of the CD meant that album covers were no longer so large.

Besides the practicalities of identifying specific records, album covers serve the purpose of advertising the musical contents on the LP, through the use of [[graphic design]], [[photography]], and/or [[illustration]]. An album cover normally has the artist's name, sometimes in [[logo]] form; and the album title. Occasionally, though more common on historical vinyl records, the cover may include a reference number; a branding (the [[Record label|label]]), and possibly a track listing. Other information is seldom included on the cover, and is usually contained on the rear or interior of the packaging, such as a track listing together with a more detailed list of those involved in making the record, band members, guest performers, engineers and producer. On the ''spine'' of the package, the artist, title, and reference number are usually repeated so that albums can be identified while tightly packed on a shelf.

== Album covers in the age of downloads ==
With the increasing popularity of digital music downloading services and the inflating cost of conducting business, the purpose and prevalence of the album cover is evolving. While the [[music industry]] tries to keep up with technological and cultural shifts, the role that packaging (and thus the "album cover") will play in consumer music sales in the near future is uncertain, although its role is certainly changing{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}, and digital forms of packaging will continue to surface, which, to some degree (and to some consumers) take the place of physical packaging.  Both MP3 and WMA music files are able to contain embedded digital album artworks (called cover images or simply covers) in jpeg format. {{as of|2008}}, physical music products, with a physical "album cover", continue to outsell digital downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSN3049009520071231?sp=true|title=Digital album packaging should improve in 2008|first = Antony | last= Bruno|publisher=Reuters|date=31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, album cover designer [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]], responsible for cover art on albums by [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[Roxy Music]], suggested that the album cover was dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/45430/designer-peter-saville-the-album-cover-is-dead|title=Peter Saville Says Album Cover is Dead|author=Jason Gregory|publisher=Gigwise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternately, some artists have used Internet technology to generate even more cover art. For instance, [[Nine Inch Nails]] initially released its album ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]'' as a free download on the band's website, attaching separate but thematically connected images to each individual track.

One digital solution is the [[iTunes LP]] format for interactive album artwork introduced by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] on 9 September 2009.

Album art is still considered a vital part of the listening experience to many, and despite the less-tangible nature of digital images, there are still many collectors trading cover art and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albumartexchange.com/about.php |title=About |publisher=Albumartexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013083754/http://www.albumartexchange.com/about.php |archivedate=2015-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Interactive Marketing and Creative Studio [https://www.hellobeaumonde.com/ Beaumonde] released a first of its kind fully [https://www.hellobeaumonde.com/blog/trill-sammy-press-release immersive and interactive album cover] for Houston-based rapper Trill Sammy. For the first time ever fans can view the 2D album like they traditionally would, then dive into the album cover via an immersive world available on Trill Sammy's Website. 

== Banned covers ==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}
{{see also|List of controversial album art}}
Some album covers have been banned due to violence, nudity and other imagery. [[Guns N' Roses]]'s 1987 album ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]''{{'}}s cover depicted a robot rapist about to be punished by a metal avenger. [[Kanye West]]'s 2010 album ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' depicted West naked being straddled by a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] with her bare breasts and bare buttocks showing.

The '''''Analects''''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|論|語}}}}; [[Old Chinese]]: ''*run ŋ(r)aʔ''; {{zh|p=''lúnyǔ''|l=Edited Conversations}}),&lt;ref&gt;[[wiktionary:Appendix:Baxter-Sagart Old Chinese reconstruction]]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''''Analects of Confucius''''', is a collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]] and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been compiled and written by Confucius's followers. It is believed to have been written during the [[Warring States period]] (475–221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-[[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the ''Analects'' was considered merely a "commentary" on the [[Five Classics]], but the status of the ''Analects'' grew to be one of the central texts of [[Confucianism]] by the end of that dynasty. 

During the late [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) the importance of the ''Analects'' as a [[philosophical|philosophy]] work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the "[[Four Books]]". The ''Analects'' has been one of the most widely-read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and [[Eastern philosophy#East Asian philosophies|East Asian thought and values]] today.

Confucius believed that the welfare of a country depended on the moral cultivation of its people, beginning from the nation's leadership. He believed that individuals could begin to cultivate an all-encompassing sense of virtue through ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]]'', and that the most basic step to cultivating ''ren'' was [[Filial piety|devotion to one's parents]] and older siblings. He taught that one's individual desires do not need to be suppressed, but that people should be educated to reconcile their desires via [[Li (Confucian)|rituals and forms of propriety]], through which people could demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society. He taught that a ruler's sense of [[De (Chinese)|virtue]] was his primary prerequisite for leadership. His primary goal in educating his students was to produce [[Junzi|ethically well-cultivated men]] who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things.

According to [[Ban Gu]], writing in the ''[[Book of Han]]'', the ''Analects'' originated as individual records kept by Confucius's disciples of conversations between the Master and them, which were then collected and jointly edited by the disciples after Confucius's death in 479 BC.  The work is therefore titled ''Lunyu'' meaning "edited conversations" or "selected speeches" (i.e. analects).{{sfnp|Knechtges|Shih|2010|p=645}}{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|p=25}}  This broadly forms the traditional account of the genesis of the work accepted by later generations of scholars, for example the [[Song dynasty]] neo-Confucian scholar [[Zhu Xi]] stated that ''Analects'' is the records of Confucius's first- and second-generation pupils.{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2013|p=26}} The view however was challenged by Qing dynasty [[philologist]] Cui Shu (崔述, 1740–1816) who argued  on linguistic ground that the last five books are much later than the rest of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqb0Fa8Umv4C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucius and the Analects : New Essays|author= Bryan W.

Regardless of how early the text of the ''Analects'' existed, most ''Analects'' scholars believe that, by the early [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD) the book was widely known and transmitted throughout China in a mostly complete form, and the book acquired its final, complete form during Han dynasty.  A Han dynasty writer [[Wang Chong]] however claimed that the ''Analects'' that existed during the Han dynasty was incomplete and formed only a part of a much larger work.{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|pp=25–26}}  A larger collection of Confucius's teachings existed in the Warring States period than has been preserved directly in the ''Analects'': 75% of Confucius's sayings cited by his second-generation student, [[Mencius]], do not exist in the received text of the ''Analects''.&lt;ref&gt;Waley 23&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Han dynasty scholar [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]], there were two versions of the ''Analects'' that existed at the beginning of the Han dynasty: the "[[Lu (state)|Lu]] version" and the "[[Qi (state)|Qi]] version". The Lu version contained twenty chapters, and the Qi version contained twenty-two chapters, including two chapters not found in the Lu version. Of the twenty chapters that both versions had in common, the Lu version had more passages. Each version had its own masters, schools, and transmitters.&lt;ref name=Gardner71516&gt;Gardner 7, 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;  In the reign of [[Emperor Jing of Han]] (r. 157–141 BC), a third version (the "[[Old Text]]" version) was discovered hidden in a wall of the home then believed to be Confucius's when the home was in the process of being destroyed by King Gong of Lu (r. 153–128 BC) in order to expand the king's palace. The new version did not contain the two extra chapters found in the Qi version, but it split one chapter found in the Lu and Qi versions in two, so it had twenty-one chapters, and the order of the chapters was different.&lt;ref name=Gardner71516 /&gt; The old text version got its name because it was written in characters not used since the earlier Warring States period (i.e. before 221 BC), when it was assumed to have been hidden.&lt;ref name="E20"&gt;Els 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Han dynasty scholar [[Huan Tan]], the old text version had four hundred characters different from the Lu version (from which the received text of the ''Analects'' is mostly based), and it seriously differed from the Lu version in twenty-seven places. Of these twenty-seven differences, the received text only agrees with the old text version in two places.&lt;ref name="W24"&gt;Waley 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a century later, the tutor of the ''Analects'' to [[Emperor Cheng of Han]], [[:zh:张禹 (西汉)|Zhang Yu]] (d. 5 BC), synthesized the Lu and Qi versions by taking the Lu version as authoritative and selectively adding sections from the Qi version, and produced a composite text of the ''Analects'' known as the "Zhang Hou Lun". This text was recognized by Zhang Yu's contemporaries and by subsequent Han scholars as superior to either individual version, and is the text that is recognized as the ''Analects'' today.&lt;ref name=Gardner71516 /&gt; The Qi version was lost for about 1800&amp;nbsp;years but re-found during the excavation of the tomb of [[Marquis of Haihun]] that was found 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0113/56820.html |title=Qi version of 'Analects of Confucius' discovered in Haihunhou tomb |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=The Institute of Archaeology |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116174212/http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0113/56820.html |archivedate=16 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No complete copies of either the Lu version or the old text version of the ''Analects'' exist today,&lt;ref name="E20" /&gt; though fragments of the old text version were discovered at [[Dunhuang manuscripts|Dunhuang]].&lt;ref name="W24" /&gt;

Before the late twentieth century the oldest existing copy of the ''Analects'' known to scholars was found in the "Stone Classics of the Xinping Era", a copy of the Confucian classics written in stone in the old Eastern Han dynasty capital of [[Luoyang]] around 175 AD. Archaeologists have since discovered two handwritten copies of the ''Analects'' that were written around 50 BC, during the Western Han dynasty. They are known as the "[[Dingzhou]] ''Analects''", and the "[[Pyongyang]] ''Analects''", after the location of the tombs in which they were found. The Dingzhou ''Analects'' was discovered in 1973, but no transcription of its contents was published until 1997. The Pyongyang ''Analects'' was discovered in 1992. Academic access to the Pyongyang ''Analects'' has been highly restricted, and no academic study on it was published until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Els 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dingzhou ''Analects'' was damaged in a fire shortly after it was entombed in the Han dynasty. It was further damaged in [[1976 Tangshan earthquake|an earthquake]] shortly after it was recovered, and the surviving text is just under half the size of the received text of the ''Analects''. Of the sections that survive, the Dingzhou ''Analects'' is shorter than the received ''Analects'', implying that the text of the ''Analects'' was still in the process of expansion when the Dingzhou ''Analects'' was entombed. There was evidence that "additions" may have been made to the manuscript after it had been completed, indicating that the writer may have become aware of at least one other version of the ''Analects'' and included "extra" material for the sake of completeness. The content of the Pyongyang ''Analects'' is similar to the Dingzhou ''Analects''; but, because of the secrecy and isolationism of the [[North Korea]]n government, only a very cursory study of it has been made available to international scholars, and its contents are not completely known outside of North Korea. Scholars do not agree about whether either the Dingzhou ''Analects'' or the Pyongyang ''Analects'' represent the Lu version, the Qi version, the old text version, or a different version that was independent of these three traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Els 6, 10–11, 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance within Confucianism===
During most of the Han period the ''Analects'' was not considered one of the principal texts of [[Confucianism]]. During the reign of [[Han Wudi]] (141–87 BC), when the Chinese government began promoting Confucian studies, only the [[Five Classics]] were considered by the government to be canonical (''jing''). They were considered Confucian because Confucius was assumed to have partially written, edited, and/or transmitted them. The ''Analects'' was considered secondary as it was thought to be merely a collection of Confucius's oral "commentary" (''zhuan'') on the Five Classics.&lt;ref name="G7"&gt;Gardner 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The political importance and popularity of Confucius and Confucianism grew throughout the Han dynasty, and by the [[Han Dynasty|Eastern Han]] the ''Analects'' was widely read by schoolchildren and anyone aspiring to literacy, and often read before the Five Classics themselves. During the Eastern Han, the heir apparent was provided a tutor specifically to teach him the ''Analects''. The growing importance of the ''Analects'' was recognized when the Five Classics was expanded to the "Seven Classics": the Five Classics plus the ''Analects'' and the ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', and its status as one of the central texts of Confucianism continued to grow until the late [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), when it was identified and promoted as one of the [[Four Books]] by [[Zhu Xi]] and generally accepted as being more insightful than the older Five Classics.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 8, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentaries===
[[File:Commentaries of the Analects of Confucius.jpg|thumb|right|A copy of He Yan's commentary on the ''Analects'', with a sub-commentary by [[Xing Bing]], printed during the [[Ming dynasty]]]]
Since the Han dynasty, Chinese readers have interpreted the ''Analects'' by reading scholars' commentaries on the book. There have been many commentaries on the ''Analects'' since the Han dynasty, but the two which have been most influential have been the ''Collected Explanations of the Analects'' (''Lunyu Jijie'') by [[He Yan]] (c.&amp;nbsp;195–249) and several colleagues, and the ''Collected Commentaries of the Analects'' (''Lunyu Jizhu'') by [[Zhu Xi]] (1130–1200). In his work, He Yan collected, selected, summarized, and rationalized what he believed to be the most insightful of all preceding commentaries on the ''Analects'' which had been produced by earlier Han and [[Cao Wei|Wei dynasty]] (220–265&amp;nbsp;AD) scholars. His personal interpretation of the ''Lunyu'' was guided by his belief that [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]] complemented each other, so that by studying both in a correct manner a scholar could arrive at a single, unified truth. Arguing for the ultimate compatibility of Daoist and Confucian teachings, he argued that "Laozi [in fact] was in agreement with the Sage" (sic). The ''Explanations'' was written in 248&amp;nbsp;AD, was quickly recognized as authoritative, and remained the standard guide to interpreting the ''Analects'' for nearly 1,000 years, until the early [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368). It is the oldest complete commentary on the ''Analects'' that still exists.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 8, 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

He Yan's commentary was eventually displaced as the definitive, standard commentary by Zhu Xi's commentary. Zhu Xi's work also brought together the commentaries of earlier scholars (mostly from the Song dynasty), along with his own interpretations. Zhu's work took part in the context of a period of renewed interest in Confucian studies, in which Chinese scholars were interested in producing a single "correct" intellectual orthodoxy that would "save" Chinese traditions and protect them from foreign influences, and in which scholars were increasingly interested in metaphysical speculation.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 18–20, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In his commentary Zhu made a great effort to interpret the ''Analects'' by using theories elaborated in the other Four Books, something that He Yan had not done. Zhu attempted to give an added coherence and unity to the message of the ''Analects'', demonstrating that the individual books of the Confucian canon gave meaning to the whole, just as the whole of the canon gave meaning to its parts. In his preface, Zhu Xi stated, "[T]he ''Analects'' and the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' are the most important works for students pursuing the [[Tao|Way]] [...] The words of the ''Analects'' are all inclusive; what they teach is nothing but the essentials of preserving the mind and cultivating [one's] nature." From the first publication of the ''Commentaries'', Zhu continued to refine his interpretation for the last thirty years of his life. In the fourteenth century, the [[Ming dynasty|Chinese government]] endorsed Zhu's commentary, and until 1905 it was read and memorized along with the ''Analects'' by all Chinese aspiring to literacy and employment as government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 7–8, 21, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Very few reliable sources about Confucius exist besides that of the Analects. The principal biography available to historians is included in [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Shiji]]'', but, because the ''Shiji'' contains a large amount of (possibly legendary) material not confirmed by extant sources, the biographical material on Confucius found in the ''Analects'' makes the ''Analects'' arguably the most reliable source of biographical information about Confucius.&lt;ref&gt;Lau ix&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius viewed himself as a "transmitter" of  social and political traditions originating in the early [[Zhou dynasty]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1000–800 BC), and claimed not to have originated anything (''Analects'' 7.1), but Confucius's social and political ideals were not popular in his time.&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;Riegel "2. Confucius' Social Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social philosophy===
Confucius's discussions on the nature of the supernatural (''Analects'' 3.12; 6.20; 11.11) indicate that he believed while "ghosts" and "spirits" should be respected, they are best kept at a distance. Instead human beings should base their values and social ideals on moral philosophy, tradition, and a natural love for others. Confucius's social philosophy largely depended on the cultivation of [[Ren (Confucianism)|''ren'']] by every individual in a community.&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; Later Confucian philosophers explained ''ren'' as the quality of having a kind manner, similar to the English words "humane", "altruistic", or "benevolent", but, of the sixty instances in which Confucius discusses ''ren'' in the ''Analects'', very few have these later meanings. Confucius instead used the term ''ren'' to describe an extremely general and all-encompassing state of virtue, one which no living person had attained completely. (This use of the term ''ren'' is peculiar to the ''Analects''.)&lt;ref&gt;Waley 27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the ''Analects'', Confucius's students frequently request that Confucius define ''ren'' and give examples of people who embody it, but Confucius generally responds indirectly to his students' questions, instead offering illustrations and examples of behaviours that are associated with ''ren'' and explaining how a person could achieve it. According to Confucius, a person with a well-cultivated sense of ''ren'' would speak carefully and modestly (''Analects'' 12.3); be resolute and firm (''Analects'' 12.20), courageous (''Analects'' 14.4), free from worry, unhappiness, and insecurity (''Analects'' 9.28; 6.21); moderate their desires and return to propriety (''Analects'' 12.1); be respectful, tolerant, diligent, trustworthy and kind (''Analects'' 17.6); and love others (''Analects'' 12.22). Confucius recognized his followers' disappointment that he would not give them a more comprehensive definition of ''ren'', but assured them that he was sharing all that he could (''Analects'' 7.23).&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

To Confucius, the cultivation of ''ren'' involved depreciating oneself through modesty while avoiding artful speech and ingratiating manners that would create a false impression of one's own character (''Analects'' 1.3). Confucius said that those who had cultivated ''ren'' could be distinguished by their being "simple in manner and slow of speech." He believed that people could cultivate their sense of ''ren'' through exercising the inverted [[Golden Rule]]: "Do not do to others what you would not like done to yourself"; "a man with ''ren'', desiring to establish himself, helps others establish themselves; desiring to succeed himself, helps others to succeed" (''Analects'' 12.2; 6.28).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; He taught that the ability of people to imagine and project themselves into the places of others was a crucial quality for the pursuit of moral self-cultivation (''Analects'' 4.15; see also 5.12; 6.30; 15.24).&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland 34&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius regarded the exercise of [[Filial piety|devotion to one's parents]] and older siblings as the simplest, most basic way to cultivate ''ren''. (''Analects'' 1.2).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;

Confucius believed that ''ren'' could best be cultivated by those who had already learned self-discipline, and that self-discipline was best learned by practicing and cultivating one's understanding of [[Li (Confucian)|''li'']]: rituals and forms of propriety through which people demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society (''Analects'' 3.3). Confucius said that one's understanding of ''li'' should inform everything that one says and does (''Analects'' 12.1). He believed that subjecting oneself to ''li'' did not mean suppressing one's desires, but learning to reconcile them with the needs of one's family and broader community. By leading individuals to express their desires within the context of social responsibility, Confucius and his followers taught that the public cultivation of ''li'' was the basis of a well-ordered society (''Analects'' 2.3).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; Confucius taught his students that an important aspect of ''li'' was observing the practical social differences that exist between people in daily life. In [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] these "five relationships" include: ruler to ruled; father to son; husband to wife; elder brother to younger brother; and friend to friend.

''Ren'' and ''li'' have a special relationship in the ''Analects'': ''li'' manages one's relationship with one's family and close community, while ''ren'' is practiced broadly and informs one's interactions with all people. Confucius did not believe that ethical self-cultivation meant unquestioned loyalty to an evil ruler. He argued that the demands of ''ren'' and ''li'' meant that rulers could oppress their subjects only at their own peril: "You may rob the Three Armies of their commander, but you cannot deprive the humblest peasant of his opinion" (''Analects'' 9.26). Confucius said that a morally well-cultivated individual would regard his devotion to loving others as a mission for which he would be willing to die (''Analects'' 15.8).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;

===Political philosophy===
Confucius's political beliefs were rooted in his belief that a good ruler would be self-disciplined, would govern his subjects through education and by his own example, and would seek to correct his subjects with love and concern rather than punishment and coercion. "If the people be led by laws, and uniformity among them be sought by punishments, they will try to escape punishment and have no sense of shame. If they are led by virtue, and uniformity sought among them through the practice of ritual propriety, they will possess a sense of shame and come to you of their own accord" (''Analects'' 2.3; see also 13.6). Confucius's political theories were directly contradictory to the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalistic]] political orientations of China's rulers, and he failed to popularize his ideals among China's leaders within his own lifetime.&lt;ref name="r3"&gt;Riegel "3. Confucius' Political Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius believed that the social chaos of his time was largely due to China's ruling elite aspiring to, and claiming, titles of which they were unworthy. When the ruler of the large state of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] asked Confucius about the principles of good government, Confucius responded: "Good government consists in the ruler being a ruler, the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a son" (''Analects'' 12.11). Confucius's analysis of the need to raise officials' behavior to reflect the way that they identify and describe themselves is known as the [[rectification of names]], and he stated that the rectification of names should be the first responsibility of a ruler upon taking office (''Analects'' 13.3). Confucius believed that, because the ruler was the model for all who were under him in society, the rectification of names had to begin with the ruler, and that afterwards others would change to imitate him (''Analects'' 12.19).&lt;ref name="r3" /&gt;

Confucius judged a good ruler by his possession of ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'' ("virtue"): a sort of moral force that allows those in power to rule and gain the loyalty of others without the need for physical coercion (''Analects'' 2.1). Confucius said that one of the most important ways that a ruler cultivates his sense of ''de'' is through a devotion to the correct practices of ''li''. Examples of rituals identified by Confucius as important to cultivate a ruler's ''de'' include: sacrificial rites held at ancestral temples to express thankfulness and humility; ceremonies of enfeoffment, toasting, and gift exchanges that bound nobility in complex hierarchical relationships of obligation and indebtedness; and, acts of formal politeness and decorum (i.e. bowing and yielding) that identify the performers as morally well-cultivated.&lt;ref name="r3" /&gt;

===Education===
The importance of education and study is a fundamental theme of the ''Analects''. For Confucius, a good student respects and learns from the words and deeds of his teacher, and a good teacher is someone older who is familiar with the ways of the past and the practices of antiquity '''(''Analects'' 7.22)'''. Confucius emphasized the need to find balance between formal study and intuitive self-reflection '''(''Analects'' 2.15)'''. When teaching he is never cited in the ''Analects'' as lecturing at length about any subject, but instead challenges his students to discover the truth through [[Socratic method|asking direct questions]], citing passages from the classics, and using analogies '''(''Analects'' 7.8)'''.&lt;ref name="Riegel4"&gt;Riegel 4 "Confucius and Education"&lt;/ref&gt; He sometimes required his students to demonstrate their understanding of subjects by making intuitive conceptual leaps before accepting their understanding and discussing those subjects at greater levels of depth. '''(''Analects'' 3.8)'''&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

His primary goal in educating his students was to produce [[Junzi|ethically well-cultivated men]] who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things '''(''Analects'' 12.11; see also 13.3)'''. He was willing to teach anyone regardless of social class, as long as they were sincere, eager, and tireless to learn '''(''Analects'' 7.7; 15.38)'''. He is traditionally credited with teaching three thousand students, though only seventy are said to have mastered what he taught. He taught [[Six Arts|practical skills]], but regarded moral self-cultivation as his most important subject.&lt;ref name="Riegel4" /&gt;

===Chapters===
In China, the traditional titles given to each chapter are mostly an initial two or three [[incipit]]s. In some cases a title may indicate a central theme of a chapter, but it is inappropriate to regard a title as a description or generalization of the content of a chapter. Chapters in the ''Analects'' are grouped by individual themes, but the chapters are not arranged in a way as to carry a continuous stream of thoughts or ideas. The themes of adjacent chapters are completely unrelated to each other. Central themes recur repeatedly in different chapters, sometimes in exactly the same wording and sometimes with small variations.

Chapter 10 contains detailed descriptions of Confucius's behaviors in various daily activities. [[Voltaire]] and [[Ezra Pound]] believed that this chapter demonstrated how Confucius was a mere human. [[Simon Leys]], who recently translated the ''Analects'' into English and French, said that the book may have been the first in human history to describe the life of an individual, historic personage. [[Elias Canetti]] wrote: "Confucius's ''Analects'' is the oldest complete intellectual and spiritual portrait of a man. It strikes one as a modern book; everything it contains and indeed everything it lacks is important."&lt;ref&gt;Canetti 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Within these incipits a large number of passages in the Analects begin with the formulaic ''ziyue'', "The Master said," but without  punctuation marks in classical Chinese, this does not confirm whether what follows ''ziyue'' is direct quotation of actual sayings of Confucius, or simply to be understood as "the Master said that.." and the paraphrase of Confucius by the compilers of the Analects.&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Ames ''The Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation'' 2010 p. 285 "A large number of passages in the Analects begin with the formulaic ziyue 子曰, "The Master said," but because there are no punctuation marks in classical Chinese, we must ask if whatever follows ziyue is a literal transcription of speech, or a paraphrase of it, or a method of transmitting ideas in a written language which existed in important ways independently of the spoken language."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arches paper''' is a brand of air-dried [[paper]] that is used by [[Printer (publisher)|printers]] and [[watercolor]]ists. It has a warm white colour and is produced in [[hot-pressed]], [[cold-pressed]], and rough varieties. Arches paper is made in the village of Arches in the [[Vosges]], France.

==History==

The history of Arches starts in 1492 when the Arches site completed the amalgamation of the paper-making facilities around the village of Arches, south of Epinal. 

The Moulins d'Arches turned to the production of high quality paper for writing and art publication. The mill thus produced paper for [[incunable]]s (the name given to the first printed books), such as the ''Chronique de Nuremberg'' by Dürer. Also printed on Arches paper was the "Description De L'Égypte" commissioned by Napoleon I upon his return from his Egyptian campaign. The work was used by the royalty from 1809 to 1828.

== Products ==
The product range comprises the following papers:
* Watercolour papers
* Drawing papers: these mould-made papers have a puffy aspect, a nice feel and conservation qualities.
* Printmaking papers
* Oil papers

* [[Cartridge paper]]

'''''Axeman''''' (originally released as '''''Axeman at Cutter's Creek''''') is a 2013 horror film written and directed by Joston Theney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bedore|first=Gary|title=KU basketball notebook: KU-Syracuse recalled; Scot Pollard kills it|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2013/apr/07/ku-basketball-notebook-ku-syracuse-recalled-scot-p/|publisher=Lawrence Journal-World|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had a limited theatrical release beginning February 14, 2013, and was released to DVD on May 6, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turek|first=Ryan|title=Scream Queens Unite to Take on the Axeman|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/348919-scream-queens-unite-to-take-on-the-axeman/|publisher=STYD|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stars Chantelle Albers as a young woman that finds herself being terrorized by an axe-wielding killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Full Cast Announced for the ''Axeman at Cutter's Creek''|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/58262/full-cast-annouinced-axeman-cutters-creek#axzz31C6nDibr|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

In a cabin by Cutter's Creek, three bank robbers are murdered by an axe-wielding [[mountain man]]. Later, a group of friends, led by Brian, are brought to the same cabin by a guide, who is apprehensive about being in the area. After settling in, Brian mentions that the reason he got the cabin for such a low price is because it supposedly once belonged to a family that was massacred by the Axeman, an unidentified serial killer whose reign of terror ended as mysteriously as it started. When the discussion concludes, Randy goes off to spy on Vivian, and is murdered by the Axeman, who rips his head off.

The next morning, Doug gets into an argument with his girlfriend, Cassidy, accusing her of still having feelings for her ex, Brian, who is now dating Cassidy's best friend, Stacy. Doug storms off into the woods, where he stumbles onto the money that the bank robbers stole. While looking for somewhere to hide the cash, Doug is impaled and dismembered by the Axeman, his death going unnoticed by his friends, who are searching for Randy. Everyone soon regroups at the cabin, and Cassidy, unsatisfied with every explanation that they can come up with for why Randy, and now Doug, are gone, leaves to continue searching for them alone.

Tammy enters the garage, where she uncovers the robbers' money, and is forced to hide when the Axeman enters with her girlfriend, Liz, who he has fatally wounded. Before he can finish Liz off, the Axeman is distracted by a knock on the door, and answers it to reveal it is the sheriff, who he identifies himself to as "Bill". Annoyed by the sheriff's abrasive attitude and persistent questioning, Bill twists her head around, and returns to the garage, just as Tammy exits it with Liz. Liz succumbs to her injuries, and Tammy is strangled by Bill, who also bites off and eats her cheeks.

Returning to the cabin, Bill rips Brian's brain out, knifes Vivian in the eye, beats Darren nearly to death, and chases Stacy through the property, catching and stabbing her when she trips over Cassidy's body. In the morning, the [[Hangover|hungover]] Deputy Whitfield ventures to the cabin in search of the sheriff, and finds Darren, who begs her for help. Before Darren can elaborate on what happened, Bill attacks him and Whitfield.

== Reception ==

''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' panned the film overall, criticizing the script for not delving into the reasons that the titular Axeman was killing people, as this would give the film more depth and differentiate it from multiple similarly plotted films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Patrick|title=''Axeman'' Is a Shallow, Frustrating Slasher|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3292428/bd-review-axeman/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theron Moore of Horror News praised the film's villain and kills, but criticized the glacial pace, uninteresting subplots, stiff acting, and two-dimensional dialogue and writing.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/85844/film-review-axeman-cutters-creek-2013/|title = Film Review: ''Axeman at Cutter's Creek'' (2013)|last = Moore|first = Theron|publisher = Horror News|date = 22 June 2014|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 6 January 2015}} &lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]'' gave a mostly favorable review for ''Axeman'', commenting that while the movie was not "reinventing the slasher genre" it "does feel like a throwback to a time when the slashers weren't so passé."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AICN HORROR has advance reviews of MEET ME THERE!

==Overview==
The movement has been seen as one of the most important times in African-American literature.

Although Reed is neither a movement apologist nor advocate, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think what Black Arts did was inspire a whole lot of Black people to write. Moreover, there would be no multiculturalism movement without Black Arts. Latinos, Asian Americans, and others all say they began writing as a result of the example of the 1960s. Blacks gave the example that you don't have to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]]. You could do your own thing, get into your own background, your own history, your own tradition and your own culture. I think the challenge is for cultural sovereignty and Black Arts struck a blow for that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aalbc.com/authors/blackartsmovement.htm|title=The Black Arts Movement (BAM)|work=African American Literature Book Club|access-date=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

BAM influenced the world of literature with the portrayal of different ethnic voices. Before the movement, the literary canon lacked diversity, and the ability to express ideas from the point of view of racial and ethnic minorities, which was not valued by the mainstream at the time.

===Influence ===
Theatre groups, poetry performances, music and dance were centered on this movement, and therefore African Americans gained social and historical recognition in the area of literature and arts. Due to the agency and credibility given, African Americans were also able to educate others through different types of expressions and media outlets about cultural differences. The most common form of teaching was through poetry reading. African-American performances were used for their own political advertisement, organization, and community issues. The Black Arts Movement was spread by the use of newspaper advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;“The Black Arts Movement (1965-1975).” The Black Arts Movement (1965-1975) | The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed, www.blackpast.org/aah/black-arts-movement-1965-1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major arts movement publication was in 1964.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"No one was more competent in [the] combination of the experimental and the vernacular than Amiri Baraka, whose volume ''Black Magic Poetry 1961–1967'' (1969) is one of the finest products of the African-American creative energies of the 1960s."&lt;ref name=uoooav/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The beginnings of the Black Arts Movement may be traced to 1965, when Amiri Baraka, at that time still known as Leroi Jones, moved uptown to establish the Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School (BARTS) following the assassination of Malcolm X.&lt;ref name=uoooav&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/brief-guide-black-arts-movement|title=A Brief Guide to the Black Arts Movement|date=February 19, 2014|publisher=poets.org|access-date=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rooted in the [[Nation of Islam]], the Black Power Movement and the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Arts Movement grew out of a changing political and cultural climate in which Black artists attempted to create politically engaged work that explored the African American cultural and historical experience.&lt;ref name=uoooav /&gt; Black artists and intellectuals such as Baraka made it their project to reject older political, cultural, and artistic traditions.&lt;ref name="Smethurst, James E 2005"&gt;Smethurst, James E. ''The Black Arts Movement: Nationalism in the 1960s and 1970s'' (The John Hope Franklin Series in African American History and Culture), NC: The University of North Carolina Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the success of sit-ins and public demonstrations of the Black student movement in the 1960s may have "inspired black intellectuals, artists, and political activists to form politicized cultural groups,"&lt;ref name="Smethurst, James E 2005" /&gt; many Black Arts activists rejected the non-militant integrational ideologies of the Civil Rights Movement and instead favored those of the Black Liberation Struggle, which emphasized "self-determination through self-reliance and Black control of significant businesses, organization, agencies, and institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Robert L. ''Resistance, Insurgence, and Identity: The Art of Mari Evans, Nelson Stevens, and the Black Arts Movement''. NJ: Africa World Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Academy of American Poets, "African American artists within the movement sought to create politically engaged work that explored the African American cultural and historical experience." The importance that the movement placed on Black autonomy is apparent through the creation of institutions such as the Black Arts Repertoire Theatre School (BARTS), created in the spring of 1964 by Baraka and other Black artists. The opening of BARTS in New York City often overshadow the growth of other radical Black Arts groups and institutions all over the United States. In fact, transgressional and international networks, those of various Left and nationalist (and Left nationalist) groups and their supports, existed far before the movement gained popularity.&lt;ref name="Smethurst, James E 2005" /&gt; Although the creation of BARTS did indeed catalyze the spread of other Black Arts institutions and the Black Arts movement across the nation, it was not solely responsible for the growth of the movement.

Although the Black Arts Movement was a time filled with black success and artistic progress, the movement also faced social and racial ridicule. The leaders and artists involved called for Black Art to define itself and speak for itself from the security of its own institutions. For many of the contemporaries the idea that somehow black people could express themselves through institutions of their own creation and with ideas whose validity was confirmed by their own interests and measures was absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOS- Calling All Black People: A Black Arts Movement Reader|last=Bracey|first=John H.|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-62534-031-3|location=Massachusetts|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is easy to assume that the movement began solely in the Northeast, it actually started out as "separate and distinct local initiatives across a wide geographic area," eventually coming together to form the broader national movement.&lt;ref name="Smethurst, James E 2005" /&gt; New York City is often referred to as the "birthplace" of the Black Arts Movement, because it was home to many revolutionary Black artists and activists. However, the geographical diversity of the movement opposes the misconception that New York (and Harlem, especially) was the primary site of the movement.&lt;ref name="Smethurst, James E 2005" /&gt;

In its beginning states, the movement came together largely through printed media. Journals such as ''Liberator'', ''The Crusader'', and ''[[Freedomways]]'' created "a national community in which ideology and aesthetics were debated and a wide range of approaches to African-American artistic style and subject displayed."&lt;ref name="Smethurst, James E 2005" /&gt; These publications tied communities outside of large Black Arts centers to the movement and gave the general black public access to these sometimes exclusive circles.

As a literary movement, Black Arts had its roots in groups such as the [[Umbra poets|Umbra Workshop]]. Umbra (1962) was a collective of young Black writers based in Manhattan's Lower East Side; major members were writers [[Steve Cannon (writer)|Steve Cannon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.placematters.net/node/1789 "A Gathering of the Tribes"] (Place Matters, January 2012) includes biography of Steve Cannon.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Dent (writer)|Tom Dent]], [[Al Haynes]], [[David Henderson (poet)|David Henderson]], [[Calvin C. Hernton]], Joe Johnson, [[Norman Pritchard (poet)|Norman Pritchard]], [[Lennox Raphael]], Ishmael Reed, [[Lorenzo Thomas (poet)|Lorenzo Thomas]], James Thompson, [[Askia M. Touré]] (Roland Snellings; also a visual artist), Brenda Walcott, and musician-writer [[Archie Shepp]]. Touré, a major shaper of "cultural nationalism," directly influenced Jones. Along with Umbra writer Charles Patterson and Charles's brother, William Patterson, Touré joined Jones, Steve Young, and others at BARTS.

Umbra, which produced ''Umbra Magazine'', was the first post-civil rights Black literary group to make an impact as radical in the sense of establishing their own voice distinct from, and sometimes at odds with, the prevailing white literary establishment. The attempt to merge a black-oriented activist thrust with a primarily artistic orientation produced a classic split in Umbra between those who wanted to be activists and those who thought of themselves as primarily writers, though to some extent all members shared both views. Black writers have always had to face the issue of whether their work was primarily political or aesthetic. Moreover, Umbra itself had evolved out of similar circumstances: in 1960 a Black nationalist literary organization, On Guard for Freedom, had been founded on the Lower East Side by [[Calvin Hicks]]. Its members included Nannie and Walter Bowe, [[Harold Cruse]] (who was then working on ''The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual'', 1967), Tom Dent, Rosa Guy, Joe Johnson, LeRoi Jones, and [[Sarah E. Wright]], among others. On Guard was active in a famous protest at the United Nations of the American-sponsored [[Bay of Pigs]] Cuban invasion and was active in support of the Congolese liberation leader [[Patrice Lumumba]]. From On Guard, Dent, Johnson, and Walcott along with Hernton, Henderson, and Touré established Umbra.

===Authors===
Another formation of black writers at that time was the [[Harlem Writers Guild]], led by [[John O. Killens]], which included [[Maya Angelou]], Jean Carey Bond, [[Rosa Guy]], and [[Sarah E. Wright|Sarah Wright]] among others. But the [[Harlem Writers Guild]] focused on prose, primarily fiction, which did not have the mass appeal of poetry performed in the dynamic vernacular of the time. Poems could be built around anthems, chants, and political slogans, and thereby used in organizing work, which was not generally the case with novels and short stories. Moreover, the poets could and did publish themselves, whereas greater resources were needed to publish fiction. That Umbra was primarily poetry- and performance-oriented established a significant and classic characteristic of the movement's aesthetics.
When Umbra split up, some members, led by Askia Touré and Al Haynes, moved to Harlem in late 1964 and formed the nationalist-oriented Uptown Writers Movement, which included poets Yusef Rahman, [[Keorapetse Kgositsile|Keorapetse "Willie" Kgositsile]] from South Africa, and [[Larry Neal]]. Accompanied by young "New Music" musicians, they performed poetry all over Harlem. Members of this group joined LeRoi Jones in founding BARTS.

Jones's move to Harlem was short-lived. In December 1965 he returned to his home, Newark (N.J.), and left BARTS in serious disarray. BARTS failed but the Black Arts center concept was irrepressible, mainly because the Black Arts movement was so closely aligned with the then-burgeoning Black Power movement.
The mid-to-late 1960s was a period of intense revolutionary ferment. Beginning in 1964, rebellions in Harlem and [[Rochester, New York]], initiated four years of long hot summers. [[Watts Riots|Watts]], [[Detroit]], Newark, [[Cleveland]], and many other cities went up in flames, culminating in nationwide explosions of resentment and anger following [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s April 1968 assassination.

[[Nathan Hare]], author of ''The Black Anglo-Saxons'' (1965), was the founder of 1960s Black Studies. Expelled from [[Howard University]], Hare moved to [[San Francisco State University]], where the battle to establish a Black Studies department was waged during a five-month strike during the 1968–69 school year. As with the establishment of Black Arts, which included a range of forces, there was broad activity in the Bay Area around Black Studies, including efforts led by poet and professor [[Sarah Webster Fabio]] at [[Merrit College]].

The initial thrust of Black Arts ideological development came from the [[Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM)]], a national organization with a strong presence in New York City. Both Touré and Neal were members of RAM. After RAM, the major ideological force shaping the Black Arts movement was the US (as opposed to "them") organization led by [[Maulana Karenga]]. Also ideologically important was [[Elijah Muhammad]]'s Chicago-based [[Nation of Islam]]. These three formations provided both style and conceptual direction for Black Arts artists, including those who were not members of these or any other political organization. Although the Black Arts Movement is often considered a New York-based movement, two of its three major forces were located outside New York City.

===Locations===
As the movement matured, the two major locations of Black Arts' ideological leadership, particularly for literary work, were California's Bay Area because of the ''Journal of Black Poetry'' and ''[[The Black Scholar]]'', and the Chicago–Detroit axis because of ''[[The Negro Digest|Negro Digest/Black World]]'' and [[Third World Press]] in Chicago, and [[Broadside Press]] and [[Naomi Long Madgett]]'s Lotus Press in Detroit. The only major Black Arts literary publications to come out of New York were the short-lived (six issues between 1969 and 1972) ''Black Theatre'' magazine, published by the [[New Lafayette Theatre]], and ''Black Dialogue'', which had actually started in San Francisco (1964–68) and relocated to New York (1969–72).

Although the journals and writing of the movement greatly characterized its success, the movement placed a great deal of importance on collective oral and performance art. Public collective performances drew a lot of attention to the movement, and it was often easier to get an immediate response from a collective poetry reading, short play, or street performance than it was from individual performances.&lt;ref name="Smethurst, James E 2005" /&gt;

The people involved in the Black Arts Movement used the arts as a way to liberate themselves. The movement served as a catalyst for many different ideas and cultures to come alive. This was a chance for African Americans to express themselves in a way that most would not have expected.

In 1967 LeRoi Jones visited Karenga in Los Angeles and became an advocate of Karenga's philosophy of [[Kawaida]]. Kawaida, which produced the "Nguzo Saba" (seven principles), [[Kwanzaa]], and an emphasis on African names, was a multifaceted, categorized activist philosophy. Jones also met [[Bobby Seale]] and [[Eldridge Cleaver]] and worked with a number of the founding members of the [[Black Panthers]]. Additionally, Askia Touré was a visiting professor at San Francisco State and was to become a leading (and long-lasting) poet as well as, arguably, the most influential poet-professor in the Black Arts movement. Playwright [[Ed Bullins]] and poet [[Marvin X]] had established Black Arts West, and Dingane Joe Goncalves had founded the ''Journal of Black Poetry'' (1966). This grouping of Ed Bullins, Dingane Joe Goncalves, LeRoi Jones, Sonia Sanchez, Askia M. Touré, and Marvin X became a major nucleus of Black Arts leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Overview of the Black Arts Movement| url=http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/blackarts/historical.htm|publisher=Department of English, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the movement grew, ideological conflicts arose and eventually became too great for the movement to continue to exist as a large, coherent collective.

==The Black Aesthetic==
Many discussions of the Black Arts movement posit it as the "aesthetic and spiritual sister of the Black Power concept."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Neal, Larry. "The Black Arts Movement", Floyd W. Hayes III (ed.), ''A Turbulent Voyage: Readings in African American Studies'', San Diego, California: Collegiate Press, 2000 (3rd edition), pp. 236–246.&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Aesthetic refers to ideologies and perspectives of art that center on Black culture and life. This Black Aesthetic encouraged the idea of Black separatism, and in trying to facilitate this, hoped to further strengthen black ideals, solidarity, and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/67472/black-aesthetic-movement "Black Arts Movement"]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' article&lt;/ref&gt;

In his well-known essay on the Black Arts Movement, Larry Neal attests: &lt;blockquote&gt;"When we speak of a 'Black aesthetic' several things are meant. First, we assume that there is already in existence the basis for such an aesthetic. Essentially, it consists of an African-American cultural tradition. But this aesthetic is finally, by implication, broader than that tradition. It encompasses most of the usable elements of the Third World culture. The motive behind the Black aesthetic is the destruction of the white thing, the destruction of white ideas, and white ways of looking at the world."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Major works ==
=== Black Art ===
Amiri Baraka's poem "[[Black Art (poem)|Black Art]]" serves as one of his most controversial, yet poetically profound supplements to the Black Arts Movement. In this piece, Baraka merges politics with art, criticizing poems that are not useful to or adequately representative of the Black struggle. First published in 1966, a period particularly known for the Civil Rights Movement, the political aspect of this piece underscores the need for a concrete and artistic approach to the realistic nature involving racism and injustice. Serving as the recognized artistic component to and having roots in the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Arts Movement aims to grant a political voice to black artists (including poets, dramatists, writers, musicians, etc.). Playing a vital role in this movement, Baraka calls out what he considers to be unproductive and assimilatory actions shown by political leaders during the Civil Rights Movement. He describes prominent Black leaders as being "on the steps of the white house...kneeling between the sheriff's thighs negotiating coolly for his people."&lt;ref name="Black Art"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nathanielturner.com/blackart.htm|title=Black Art|website=www.nathanielturner.com|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baraka also presents issues of euro-centric mentality, by referring to Elizabeth Taylor as a prototypical model in a society that influences perceptions of beauty, emphasizing its influence on individuals of white and black ancestry.&lt;ref name="Black Art"/&gt; Baraka aims his message toward the Black community, with the purpose of coalescing African Americans into a unified movement, devoid of white influences. "Black Art" serves as a medium for expression meant to strengthen that solidarity and creativity, in terms of the Black Aesthetic. Baraka believes poems should "shoot…come at you, love what you are" and not succumb to mainstream desires.&lt;ref name="Black Art"/&gt;

He ties this approach into the emergence of hip-hop, which he paints as a movement that presents "live words…and live flesh and coursing blood."&lt;ref name="Black Art"/&gt; Baraka's cathartic structure and aggressive tone are comparable to the beginnings of hip-hop music, which created controversy in the realm of mainstream acceptance, because of its  "authentic, un-distilled, unmediated forms of contemporary black urban music."&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/facing-new-millennium/essays/pop-music-and-spatialization-race-1990s|title=Pop Music and the Spatialization of Race in the 1990s {{!}} The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|date=July 12, 2012 |website=www.gilderlehrman.org|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baraka believes that integration inherently takes away from the legitimacy of having a Black identity and Aesthetic in an anti-Black world. Through pure and unapologetic blackness, and with the absence of white influences, Baraka believes a black world can be achieved. Though hip-hop has been serving as a recognized salient musical form of the Black Aesthetic, a history of unproductive integration is seen across the spectrum of music, beginning with the emergence of a newly formed narrative in mainstream appeal in the 1950s. Much of Baraka's cynical disillusionment with unproductive integration can be drawn from the 50s, a period of rock and roll, in which "record labels actively sought to have white artists "cover" songs that were popular on the rhythm-and-blues charts"&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt; originally performed by African-American artists. The problematic nature of unproductive integration is also exemplified by Run-DMC, an American hip-hop group founded in 1981, who became widely accepted after a calculated collaboration with the rock group Aerosmith on a remake of the latter's "Walk This Way" took place in 1986, evidently appealing to young white audiences.&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt; Hip-hop emerged as an evolving genre of music that continuously challenged mainstream acceptance, most notably with the development of rap in the 1990s. A significant and modern example of this is Ice Cube, a well-known American rapper, songwriter, and actor, who introduced subgenre of hip-hop known as "gangsta rap," merged social consciousness and political expression with music. With the 1960s serving as a more blatantly racist period of time, Baraka notes the revolutionary nature of hip-hop, grounded in the unmodified expression through art. This method of expression in music parallels significantly with Baraka's ideals presented in "Black Art," focusing on poetry that is also productively and politically driven.

=== "The Revolutionary Theatre" ===
"The Revolutionary Theatre" is a 1965 essay by Baraka that was an important contribution to the Black Arts Movement, discussing the need for change through literature and theater arts. He says: "We will scream and cry, murder, run through the streets in agony, if it means some soul will be moved, moved to actual life understanding of what the world is, and what it ought to be." Baraka wrote his poetry, drama, fiction and essays in a way that would shock and awaken audiences to the political concerns of black Americans, which says much about what he was doing with this essay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/amiri-baraka|title=Amiri Baraka|date=October 31, 2016|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also did not seem coincidental to him that Malcolm X and [[John F. Kennedy]] had been assassinated within a few years, since Baraka believed that every voice of change in America had been murdered, which led to the writing that would come out of the Black Arts Movement.

In his essay, Baraka says: "The Revolutionary Theatre is shaped by the world, and moves to reshape the world, using as its force the natural force and perpetual vibrations of the mind in the world. We are history and desire, what we are, and what any experience can make us."

With his thought-provoking ideals and references to a euro-centric society, he imposes the notion that black Americans should stray from a white aesthetic in order to find a black identity. In his essay, he says: "The popular white man's theatre like the popular white man's novel shows tired white lives, and the problems of eating white sugar, or else it herds bigcaboosed blondes onto huge stages in rhinestones and makes believe they are dancing or singing." This, having much to do with a white aesthetic, further proves what was popular in society and even what society had as an example of what everyone should aspire to be, like the "bigcaboosed blondes" that went "onto huge stages in rhinestones". Furthermore, these blondes made believe they were "dancing and singing" which Baraka seems to be implying that white people dancing is not what dancing is supposed to be at all. These allusions bring forth the question of where black Americans fit in the public eye. Baraka says: "We are preaching virtue and feeling, and a natural sense of the self in the world. All men live in the world, and the world ought to be a place for them to live." Baraka's essay challenges the idea that there is no space in politics or in society for black Americans to make a difference through different art forms that consist of, but are not limited to, poetry, song, dance, and art. &lt;!--Despite what the world believes, Baraka chooses to make a change with the powerful words of The Revolutionary Theatre.--&gt;

== Effects on society ==
According to the [[Academy of American Poets]], "many writers--Native Americans, Latinos/as, gays and lesbians, and younger generations of African Americans have acknowledged their debt to the Black Arts Movement."&lt;ref name=uoooav/&gt; The movement lasted for about a decade, through the mid-1960s and into the 1970s. This was a period of controversy and change in the world of [[literature]]. One major change came through in the portrayal of new ethnic voices in the United States. English-language literature, prior to the Black Arts Movement, was dominated by white authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nielson|first1=Erik|title=White Surveillance of the Black Arts|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=204d8194-6413-4bb2-b22e-077b4e1aeabb%40sessionmgr110&amp;vid=36&amp;hid=118|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans became a greater presence not only in the field of literature but in all areas of the arts. Theater groups, poetry performances, music and dance were central to the movement. Through different forms of media, African Americans were able to educate others about the expression of cultural differences and viewpoints. In particular, black poetry readings allowed African Americans to use [[vernacular]] dialogues. This was shown in the Harlem Writers Guild, which included black writers such as Maya Angelou and Rosa Guy. These performances were used to express political slogans and as a tool for organization. Theater performances also were used to convey community issues and organizations. The theaters, as well as cultural centers, were based throughout America and were used for community meetings, study groups and film screenings. Newspapers were a major tool in spreading the Black Arts Movement. In 1964, ''Black Dialogue'' was published, making it the first major Arts movement publication.

The Black Arts Movement, although short, is essential to the history of the United States. It spurred [[political activism]] and use of speech throughout every African-American community.  It allowed African Americans the chance to express their voices in the mass media as well as become involved in communities.

It can be argued that "the Black Arts movement produced some of the most exciting poetry, drama, dance, music, visual art, and fiction of the post-World War II United States" and that many important "post-Black artists" such as [[Toni Morrison]], [[Ntozake Shange]], [[Alice Walker]], and [[August Wilson]] were shaped by the movement.&lt;ref name="Smethurst, James E 2005" /&gt;

The Black Arts Movement also provided incentives for public funding of the arts and increased public support of various arts initiatives.&lt;ref name="Smethurst, James E 2005" /&gt;

The '''Croswell Opera House''' is a historic [[theatre|theater]] located at 129 East Maumee Street in [[Adrian, Michigan|Adrian]], [[Michigan]].  It is recognized as the oldest theater in the state and among the oldest continuously operating theaters in the United States. The theater was designated as a [[Michigan State Historic Preservation Office|Michigan Historic Site]] on March 2, 1976 and later added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the '''Adrian Union Hall-Croswell Opera House''' on April 18, 1985.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCGI/&gt;

==History==

=== Early history ===
The Croswell Opera House, or Adrian Union Hall as it was originally called, was completed in 1866. It was financed by the Adrian Union Hall Company, whose stockholders included future Michigan governor [[Charles Croswell]]. Its first public event, taking place on March 19, was a lecture by temperance advocate [[John Bartholomew Gough]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behind the Curtain: 150 Years at Michigan's Oldest Theater|last=Gable|first=Erik|publisher=Croswell Opera House and Fine Arts Association|year=2016|isbn=978-0-692-80582-4|location=Adrian, Michigan|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unpublished diary|last=Cleveland|first=Charles|publisher=|year=1866|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hall served many functions during its early years. It hosted concerts, lectures, festivals, and theatrical performances by both traveling troupes and amateur local groups. Famous speakers who visited the opera house included [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Thomas Nast]], [[Henry Ward Beecher]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. During the 19th century it hosted performances by [[Edwin Booth]], [[John Philip Sousa]], and [[Buffalo Bill|Buffalo Bill Cody]]; the early 20th century saw appearances by [[Mrs Patrick Campbell|Mrs. Patrick Campbell]] and [[Maude Adams]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Croswell has gone by many different names. During its first few years of operation, the local newspaper usually referred to it as "New Hall." Around 1869, it started to be called the Opera House. When Charles Croswell retired as governor in 1881, he returned to Adrian and began buying up shares in the Adrian Union Hall Company, eventually becoming the majority shareholder; he then tasked his son, Charles Croswell Jr., with managing the theater. At this time it became known as Croswell's Opera House. Charles Croswell Jr. gave up the manager's job after his father's death in 1886, but although the possessive was dropped, the name stuck.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A new lobby was added to the original building in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Tea-Table Talk|last=|first=|date=September 29, 1882|work=Adrian Daily Times and Expositor|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, the theater's first electric lights were installed — just two of them — and the entire theater was outfitted for electricity in 1895. The lighting apparatus was designed by Harry A. Fee, who is better known for creating [[Hidden Lake Gardens]] in nearby Franklin Township.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Electrical effects utilized in lighting Adrian's opera house|last=|first=|date=August 20, 1895|work=Adrian Daily Times and Expositor|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, to meet the demands of that era's increasingly elaborate theatrical productions, the stage was expanded and the roof above the stage raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Up-to-date improvements in the stage of Croswell Opera House|last=|first=|date=July 25, 1896|work=Adrian Daily Times and Expositor|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The movie theater years ===
In the early 20th century, the Croswell faced increasing competition from movie theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Croswell Opera House in Adrian, Michigan, 1900-1920|last=Kiersey|first=Stephen Francis|publisher=Michigan State University|year=1977|isbn=|location=East Lansing, Michigan|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was purchased in 1919 by Harry Angell and Robert Codd, who undertook two major renovations. The first, in 1919, converted the Croswell into a movie house. A long arcade-style lobby was added to the front of the building, as was a projection booth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Croswell Theater to re-open December 24|last=|first=|date=December 20, 1919|work=Adrian Daily Telegram|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1921, the original balcony was torn out and replaced and the entire auditorium remodeled. It was during this renovation that the Croswell's interior took on its modern appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Big crowd attends Croswell opening|last=|first=|date=September 2, 1921|work=Adrian Daily Telegram|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Croswell was leased in 1927 by Butterfield Theatres, which would continue to operate it for the next 40 years. It was wired for sound in 1929; the first talking picture shown was ''[[Weary River]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During World War II, the Croswell raised more than $1 million for the war effort by holding "war bond premieres." The management would bring in a popular new film, and tickets were not for sale; only a newly purchased war bond would entitle a person to admission. Charity toy drives and children's food matinees were also common.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Movies by TV? It irks him|last=|first=|date=February 7, 1967|work=The Daily Telegram|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, however, the Croswell faced increasing competition from drive-in theaters and television. A theater with about 1,000 seats — the Croswell's capacity at the time — but only one screen was impractical to operate. In March 1967, the Butterfield chain announced it would not renew its lease, and owner Harry Angell put the building up for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Croswell for sale|last=|first=|date=March 23, 1967|work=The Daily Telegram|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last movie of the Butterfield era, ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', closed on September 16, 1967.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Revival of live theater ===
With Butterfield's decision to pull out, the Croswell was in danger of being demolished. But Charlie Hickman, the owner of local manufacturing company Brazeway, stepped forward to buy the building, and a new nonprofit organization was chartered to take over its operation. The newly revived Croswell staged its first summer season of live theater in 1968, beginning with a production of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Barefoot in the Park]]''. This was followed by ''[[Summer and Smoke]]'', ''[[Oliver!]]'', and ''[[Once More, with Feeling (play)|Once More, With Feeling]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

That fall, a new group, the Croswell Players, was formed to continue offering theater during the fall, winter and spring. Eventually, the Croswell's summer and winter theater programs would merge.

In 1970, the tradition of bringing high-profile speakers to Adrian to speak at the Croswell was revived. Speakers in the theater's Town Hall series, which ran from 1970 to 1996, included [[Gloria Steinem]], [[Helen Thomas]], [[Arianna Huffington]], [[Ralph Nader]], [[Julian Bond]], [[Art Linkletter]], [[Jeane Dixon]], [[Bella Abzug]], [[Kitty Carlisle]], [[Charlton Heston]], and "Dear Abby" author [[Pauline Phillips]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A capital campaign to renovate the theater was announced in May 2015, with changes to include new public spaces, more restrooms, Americans with Disabilities Act improvements, and electrical and other infrastructure upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lenconnect.com/article/20150612/ENTERTAINMENT/150619649|title=Croswell Opera House planning renovations, sets $6.2 million fundraising goal|last=Bachanov|first=Arlene|date=June 12, 2015|work=The Daily Telegram|access-date=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in 2016 and the theater reopened in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lenconnect.com/news/20170507/renovated-croswell-opera-house-reopens|title=Renovated Croswell Opera House reopens|last=Bachanov|first=Arlene|date=May 7, 2017|work=The Daily Telegram|access-date=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 season will mark the Croswell's 50th summer as a producing theater.

== Architecture ==
The Croswell was originally designed by [[Horatio Nelson White]]. In 1865, while the theater was still under construction, a correspondent for the [[Detroit Free Press]] visited Adrian and gave this description:&lt;blockquote&gt;During this season, notwithstanding the high wages, cost of lumber and all building materials, there have been many fine buildings, dwellinghouses and stores erected. The first one particularly attracting attention on entering the city from the depot is “Union Hall,” a large brick structure erected and owned by a joint-stock company at a cost of $35,000. This building is located on the lower end of Maumee street, and fronts directly on it. It is one hundred and fifteen feet and ten inches deep, by sixty-four feet and four inches wide, and built of such a height that the main hall will finish thirty-two feet in the clear. The principal audience room is at some little distance from the street, and is reached through an arched passage-way, on each side of which is an elegant and commodious store. It is eighty feet in depth and sixty-three feet wide, with a gallery on three sides containing three rows of seats, calculated to seat with comfort fifteen hundred people. In the erection of the gallery a new feature is introduced, which, by means of trusses, braces and iron ties, makes it self-supporting, and entirely does away with the necessity of columns or ungainly brackets to support it. There is a large stage, 30x32 feet, which is fitted up for theatrical exhibitions, with scenery, dressing-rooms, &amp;c. In the arrangement of the scenery, some new ideas are carried out, several of the side scenes folding up, while the principal fines, five in number, are suspended from large cylinders overhead, being hoisted and lowered by means of machinery, completely doing away with the squeaking, rattling and confusion generally attendant upon the shifting and sliding of the different pieces, and as a whole scene is raised or lowered at once, the ridiculous gap often seen in the center of an elegant painting is obviated. In the basement are the furnaces for heating the building, a large storeroom capable of containing all the seats of the hall, when it is cleared for the benefit of those tripping the “light fantastic toe,” and a large dining room, which extends the entire length of the building. The ceiling and walls are to be frescoed, and if finished according to design, will present an elegant and tasteful appearance, reflecting much credit on the designers and owners, and the city. In the erection of the structure there is no attempt at the gaudy or gorgeous, everything in and about it is plain, sold ''[sic.]'' and substantial. It was designed by H. N. White, of Syracuse, New York, and erected under the supervision of Mr. Smith, a master-builder of this city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Detroit Free Press|last=|first=|date=October 11, 1865|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Writing some time later, local historian R.I. Bonner reported that the Croswell was patterned after Wieting Hall in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Geo. Bonner and Croswell Opera House|last=Bonner|first=R.I.|date=January 12, 1918|work=Adrian Daily Telegram|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical appearance of the Croswell changed several times over the course of the 19th century. A 14-foot addition was built on the front of the theater in 1882, and the stage roof was raised in 1896 to accommodate more elaborate scenery.

The 1919 and 1921 renovations were directed by architect J.C. Brompton, who also designed the Riviera Theatre in [[Three Rivers, Michigan|Three Rivers]]. In 1919, a projection booth was built onto the front of the building and a long arcade-style lobby was added; previously, patrons had to walk down a long alley from Maumee Street and wait outdoors before a show. In 1921, the original horseshoe-shaped balcony was torn out and replaced and the entire interior of the theater was redesigned.

Some of the theater's distinctive features include ornate plaster detailing around the entire auditorium, two tall organ towers on either side of the stage with decorate urns built into them, and large panels on the walls reminiscent of the ones that can be seen in Brompton's RIviera Theatre.

From 1921 until the 1970s, only minor changes were made to the Croswell's interior. In 1976, an addition was built on the back of the theater for a scene shop and offices. Two buildings on either side of the Croswell's front lobby were purchased in 1978 and 1979 and added to the theater, becoming space for rehearsals, offices and an art gallery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The theater was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.&lt;ref name="nris" /&gt;

== Current use ==
The Croswell is a [[Theatre#Producing vs. presenting|producing theater]] and operates year-round, staging six to eight full-scale musicals per year, along with straight plays, children's theater, and occasional concerts. It is owned by the Croswell Opera House and Fine Arts Association, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Its artistic director since 2009 is Jere Righter.

=== Musical theater ===
The majority of shows produced at the Croswell are musicals. A live orchestra, rather than recorded music, is employed for all of the theater's full-length musicals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Croswell's 2017 season will include ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (musical)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'', [[In the Heights|''In the'' ''Heights'']], ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis (musical)|Meet Me in St. Louis]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In a '''cumulative tale''', sometimes also called a '''chain tale''', action or dialogue repeats and builds up in some way as the tale progresses. With only the sparest of plots, these tales often depend upon repetition and rhythm for their effect, and can require a skilled storyteller to negotiate their tongue-twisting repetitions in performance.&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ashliman|first= D.L.|authorlink=D. L. Ashliman|editor= Donald. Haase|encyclopedia= The Greenwood encyclopedia of folktales and fairy tales |title=Chain Tale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9KEk9wQPjkC|publisher= Greenwood Press|isbn= 978-0-313-33441-2|page= 176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climax is sometimes abrupt and sobering as in "[[The Gingerbread Man]]."   The device often takes the form of a [[cumulative song]] or [[nursery rhyme]]. Many cumulative tales feature a series of animals or forces of nature each more powerful than the last.

==History==
Cumulative tales have a long pedigree. In an early Jewish [[Midrash]], considered to date from the sixth century AD, [[Abraham]] is brought before King [[Nimrod]], who commands him to worship fire.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Nimrod#Text of the Midrash Raba version|Text of the Midrash Raba version]]. This is not itself a cumulative tale, though many cumulative tales seem to echo its theme.&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham replies that it would be more reasonable to worship water, which can quench fire and is therefore more powerful. When this premise is granted, he points out that the clouds, as sustainers of water, are more worthy of worship, and then that the wind that disperses them is more powerful still. Finally he confronts Nimrod with the observation that "man can stand up against the wind or shield himself behind the walls of his house" ([[Genesis Rabba]] xxxviii).

There is a similar tale, [[The Mouse Turned into a Maid]], in the [[Panchatantra]], in which the mouse-maid is successively introduced to the sun, the cloud, the wind and the mountain. She prefers each in turn as stronger than the last, but finally a mouse is found to be stronger than even the mountain, and so she marries the mouse. Stories of this type, such as the Japanese [[The Husband of the Rat's Daughter]], are widely diffused.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. L. Ashliman]], "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type2031c.html The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun: fables of Aarne-Thompson type 2031C]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
In the [[Aarne-Thompson]] classification system, types 2000-2100 are all cumulative tales, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/folktexts.html D. L. Ashliman's page of story types]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical reference==

One of the four [[Panhellenic Games]] were the [[Pythian Games]] in [[Delphi]]. Held every four years, they included competitions in athletics, theatre, music, poetry, and painting to praise the god [[Apollo]], the symbol of the [[Oracle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485272/Pythian-Games Pythian Games], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 394 A.D., [[Theodosius I]], the emperor of the [[Byzantine Empire]] banned all Panhellenic Games as being pagan events.

Since 1912 till 1948, on the initiative of [[Pierre de Coubertin]], [[art competitions at the Summer Olympics]] were held in various countries. Medals were awarded for works related solely to [[sport]].&lt;ref&gt;''Richard Stanton.'' The forgotten Olympic art competitions — The story of the Olympic art competitions of the 20th century. Trafford Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|1-55212-606-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also an attempt to revive Pythian Games at the archeological site of Delphi, at the initiative by the Greek poet [[Angelos Sikelianos]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salamina-online.com/aggelos_sikelianos.htm Aggelos Sikelianos]&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Eva Palmer. In 1927, the first Delphic Festival was held in Greece, but the revival was then abandoned.

Nowadays there are so-called Delphi Festivals, which are the closest to their Panhellenic counterparts. They include religious rituals and activities like poetry competition, religious offerings, sports and of course feasting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greeka.com/sterea/delphi/delphi-festivals.htm Information about the Festivals of Delphi Greece]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:DF-1927 copy.jpg|150px|thumb|Poster of the Delphic Festival, 1927]]

In the second half of the 20th century, there was another attempt to restore Delphic Games. Since the 1990s, representatives from Argentina, Austria, China, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, [[Germany]], Greece, Kazakhstan, Libya, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the United States came together and organized First International Delphic Games, which took place in 2000 in Moscow, Russia (before that the concept was tested out in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], where First Junior Delphic Games took place.)

==Current revivials==
Currently, there are two organizations conducting Delphic Games.

The '''[[International Delphic Council]]''' (IDC) with headquarters in Berlin was founded in 1994 at the [[Schönhausen Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.392280880813927.79902.369642239744458&amp;type=1| title=Foundation of the IDC| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995 the IDC actively supports the creation of the National Delphic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.386038754771473.78926.369642239744458&amp;type=1| title=Foundation of the NDC Nigeria| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.384951174880231.78728.369642239744458&amp;type=1| title=Foundation of the "Delphic Movement in Russia"| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997 the IDC has organized the International Youth Delphic Games in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Germany, Philippines, South Africa, as well as, since 2000, the International Delphic Games for adult participants in Russia, Malaysia, South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;''Lee Kyung-min''.[http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/4908/top-artists-gather-3rd-jeju-delphic-games  Top Artists to Gather at 3rd Jeju Delphic Games] September 7th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |date= |url=http://delphic.org/english/03games/chronology.htm |title=Delphic Games |publisher=// delphic.org |accessdate=2014-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102191231/http://delphic.org/english/03games/chronology.htm |archivedate=2014-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDC held Delphic Games and Junior Delphic Games in the four-year cycle, two years offset from one another, such as the Olympic Games, held at different locations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=http://www.kulturserver.de/-/organisationen/detail/52021| title=International Delphic Council| publisher=// kulturserver.de| accessdate=2014-07-03|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=http://www.virtualmarket.itb-berlin.de/?Action=showCompany&amp;id=57634| title=International Delphic Council: ITB Berlin Virtual Market Place| publisher=// virtualmarket.itb-berlin.de| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Delphic  Games and Congresses receive greetings, patronage and support from various international organizations and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=392267214148627&amp;set=a.392265017482180.79897.369642239744458&amp;type=1&amp;theater| title=The letter with the greeting message from the Council of Europe| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.387774587931223.79201.369642239744458&amp;type=1| title=2nd Delphic World Congress| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer organization, '''[[International Delphic Committee]]''' (IDC) with headquarters in Moscow, was registered in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idcworld.ru/news.list?year=2006&amp;lang=en Opening of the website of the International Delphic Committee]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes International Delphic Games, Youth Delphic Games of Russia and Youth Delphic Games of [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]].

{{Disability}}
'''Disability art''' or '''disability arts''' is any art, theatre, fine arts, film, writing, music that takes disability as its theme or whose context relates to disability.&lt;ref name="Shape" /&gt;

==Meaning==

Disability arts is an area of art where the context of the art takes on disability as its theme. Disability art is about exploring the conceptual ideas and physical realities of what it is like to be disabled or concepts relating to the word.

==Context==

Disability art is different from [[Disability in the arts]] which refers more to the active participation or representation of disabled people in the arts rather than the context of the work being about disability. Disability art does not require the maker of the art to be disabled (see Disability Arts in the Disability Arts Movement for the exception) nor does art made by a disabled person automatically become disability art just because it was a disabled person that made it. 

An example of disability art by a non-disabled person: ''Alison Lapper Pregnant'', 2005, [[Marc Quinn]]&lt;ref name="clearup" /&gt; is disability art&lt;ref name="Bragg" /&gt; because of its context as he reveals the concept of the work was to make "the ultimate statement about disability"&lt;ref name="quinn" /&gt; 

An example of disability art by a disabled person: ''effective, defective, creative'', 2000, [[Yinka Shonibare]], shows photos of foetuses from women deemed to be at risk of delivering a defective baby,&lt;ref name="science" /&gt; therefore looking at the relationship of defectiveness and disability.  

An example of art made by a disabled person that is not disability art: ''Dorothea'', 1995, [[Chuck Close]];  relates to his "strict adherence to the self-imposed rules that have guided his art" and "formal analysis and methodological reconfiguration of the human face" &lt;ref name="moma" /&gt; therefore conceptually has nothing to do with disability therefore is not disability art.

==Context of disability art in the disability arts movement==

Disability art is a concept which was developed out of the disability arts movement.&lt;ref name="DAC" /&gt; In the disability arts movement disability art stood for "art made by disabled people which reflects the experience of disability."&lt;ref name="DAO" /&gt; To be making disability art in the disability arts movement it is conditional on being a disabled person.

==Development of the concept of disability art in Britain==

The development of disability art began in the 1970s / 80s as a result of the new political activism of the disabled peoples' movement.&lt;ref name="DAC" /&gt; The exact date the term came into use is currently unverified, although the first use of the term in the Disability Arts Chronology is 1986.&lt;ref name="Chronology" /&gt; During this period the term "disability art" in the disability arts movement has been retrospectively agreed to mean "art made by disabled people which reflects the experience of disability".&lt;ref name="Lear" /&gt; 

As the movement and term developed, the disability arts movement began to expand from what mainly started out as disabled people's cabaret to all art forms. The disability arts movement began to grow year on year and was at its height during the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Chronology" /&gt; Key exhibitions which looked at disability art happened like ''Barriers'', which was an exhibition considering physical, sensory and intellectual limitation and its effect on personal art practice. (8 Feb - 16 Mar 2007: Aspex Gallery, Portsmouth)&lt;ref name="Chronology" /&gt; and the creation of the Disability Film Festival in London in 1999,&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;  – both of which looked at work by disabled people as well as disability arts.  

Disabled people's politics in Britain was changed by the Disability Discrimination Act of 1995.&lt;ref name="DDA" /&gt; In the subsequent years as people adapted to the protection of legislation a new wave of politics entered in the disability arts movement. In 2004 the revised Disability Discrimination Act signified the end of the domination of art based on discrimination politics in the disability arts movement. A new generation of disabled people were less political&lt;ref name=" DAC" /&gt; and carried an agenda of integration. This combined with the carers movement highlighted a change in attitude that acknowledged the work of the disability arts movement to claim the term "disability art" but showed a movement away from the idea that only disabled people could make disability art. It began to be recognised that disability art needs to be "supported by society itself and not just by disabled people".&lt;ref name="Williamson" /&gt;

In 2007 the London Disability Arts Forum held a debate at the [[Tate Modern]] on the motion 'Should disability and Deaf art be dead and buried in the 21st Century?' produced in response to arts cuts from the [[Arts Council]] faced by disabled-led arts organisations at the time. This debate has become significant in the way Melvin Bragg's article highlighted how disability art like Marc Quinn's sculpture Alison Lapper Pregnant raise the profile of disability in the arts.&lt;ref name="Bragg" /&gt; This debate and subsequent article set in motion a change for many people to recognise that the new generation of disabled people and artists did not feel it necessary to control the term disability arts but to open it out for a wider view on disability. 

Very few people are aware of disability as a topic of art,&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt; mainly due to the lack of accessible and cohesive academic work and publications around the subjects of disability art and the disability arts movement. It has yet to enter into the art curriculum or establish itself as a strongly recognised concept in the arts – so development of the subject needs much more work for it to justify its place as a relevant term long term in the arts. On the other hand, in some instances, artists, curators or theorists who identify as disabled and make, curate or write about disability in their creative practices feel ambivalent about this category.

In some circles disability art is still promoted as "art made by disabled people that reflects the experience of disability." This is most notably the line taken by NDACA Co-op,&lt;ref name=" NDACACO" /&gt; which is predominantly made up of members who were key to the development of the disability arts movement. Although it is more commonly accepted that non-disabled people can make valid disability art, even by people that strongly align themselves with the disability arts movement.&lt;ref name=" Gosling" /&gt;

==Development of the concept of disability arts in the United States==

VSA, (previously Very Special Arts), the international organization on arts and disability in the United States, was founded more than 35 years ago{{when?|date=December 2015}} by Ambassador [[Jean Kennedy Smith]] to provide arts and education opportunities for people with disabilities and increase access to the arts for all. With 52 international affiliates and a network of nationwide affiliates, VSA is providing arts and education programming for youth and adults with disabilities around the world.&lt;ref name="vsa"/&gt;

The development of disability arts in the USA is also tied to several non-profit organizations such as Creative Growth in Oakland, CA, that serves adult artists with developmental, mental and physical disabilities, providing a professional studio environment for artistic development, gallery exhibition and representation and a social atmosphere among peers.&lt;ref name="creative growth"/&gt; Organizations with similar mandates in the [[Bay Area]] include Creativity Explored in San Francisco, and NIAD Art Center in Richmond http://www.niadart.org. NIAD Art Center - Nurturing Independence through Artistic Development (formerly registered as National Institute of Art &amp; Disabilities) - was established in 1982 by the late Florence Ludins-Katz and the late Elias Katz, PhD. Many other organizations with similar visions and mandates can be found across the country.

Currently, the leading scholars in disability arts in the USA include Michael Davidson, Lennard Davis, [[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]], Ann Fox, Jessica Cooley, Joseph Grigely, Georgina Kleege, Petra Kuppers, Simi Linton, Ann Millett-Gallant, Amanda Cachia, David. T Mitchell, Carrie Sandahl, Susan Schweik, Tobin Siebers and Sharon L. Snyder, who write about a range of topics within disability arts, such as performance, literature, aesthetics, visual art, music, art history, theatre, film, dance, curatorial studies, and more. 

[[Bodies of Work: Network of Disability Arts &amp; Culture]] (including artists and organizations) is one of the leading disability arts festivals occurring in Chicago every few years, whose art illuminates the disability experience. From the local to the international, "bodies of work" explores innovative forms of artistic expression, derived from unique bodies and minds, that explore the disability experience, advance the rights of disabled people, and widen society's understanding of what it means to be human.&lt;ref name="bodies of work"/&gt;

Artists who identify as disabled and make work about disability are growing in numbers, as are curators who identify as disabled and curate exhibitions on disability. Katherine Ott is a curator at the [[National Museum of American History]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] who has curated a number of exhibits on the history of the body, disability, ethnic and folk medicine, integrative and alternative medicine, ophthalmology, plastic surgery and dermatology, medical technology, prosthetics and rehabilitation, sexuality, visual and material culture and other ephemera.&lt;ref name="katherine ott"/&gt;

==Development of the concept of disability arts in other countries==

Non-profit, government-funded organizations dedicated to providing resources and support towards activities in disability art are numerous in countries like Australia and Canada. In Australia, such organizations include Arts Access Australia (peak body), Accessible Arts (NSW), DADAA (WA), Arts Access Victoria (VIC) and more.&lt;ref name="arts access australia"/&gt; In Canada, organizations include the Indefinite Arts Centre (Calgary), Arts &amp; Disability Network Manitoba, Kickstart Arts - disability arts and culture and Tangled Gallery, showcasing Disability Art in Toronto.&lt;ref name="kickstart arts"/&gt; These organizations work to increase opportunities and access for people with disability as artists, arts-workers, participants and audiences. They offer services to their members, such as representation and advocacy, facilitation and development, information and advice, grants and more. Many of these organizations use the [[Social model of disability]], thus they use the term ‘disability’ to refer to barriers, rather than medical conditions or impairments. They might categorize ‘people with disability’, to mean anyone with sensory or physical impairments, hidden impairments, intellectual impairments, learning difficulties or mental health conditions. These organizations recognise and value the culture and language of the Deaf community, and include them within this definition in recognition of the similar barriers that many deaf people face accessing the arts.&lt;ref name="arts access australia"/&gt;

A '''dresser''' is a [[Stagecraft|theatrical]] [[stagehand]] who is involved with maintaining [[costume]] quality at each [[performance]]. They are hired by either the [[theatre director|director]], [[theatrical producer|producer]], or [[Wardrobe Supervisor|wardrobe supervisor]]. They report directly to the wardrobe supervisor and are usually paid by the hour.

Dressers are responsible for assisting cast members with costume changes backstage, when necessary. They are often used to assist primarily with quick costume changes, where a character exits and must enter again very quickly wearing a different costume.

'''''Girls Rock!''''' is a 2007 documentary film that follows four 8-18-year-old girls at the [[Rock and Roll Camp for Girls]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], [[United States]].

At Rock and Roll Camp, girls ranging in age from eight to 18 are taught that "it is 100% okay to be exactly who you are."  The girls have a week to select a band, an instrument they may have never played before, and write a song.  In between, they are taught by indie rock stars such as Carrie Brownstein from [[Sleater-Kinney]] various lessons of empowerment from self-defense to anger management.  At the end of the week, all the bands perform a concert for over 700 people.  The film follows several campers: Laura, a Korean adoptee obsessed with death metal; Misty, who is emerging from a life of meth addiction, homelessness and gang activity; and Amelia, an eight-year-old who writes experimental rock songs about her dog Pipi.

The film ultimately explores what happens to the girls as they are given a temporary reprieve from being sexualized, analyzed, and pressured to conform.

==Screenings==
The movie opened in the following cities on March 7, 2008: New York, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, San Francisco, Berkeley, Chicago.

==Critical reception==
The film received generally favorable reviews from critics. As of March 7, 2008, the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 78% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on nine reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1192245-_girls_rock/ |title=Girls Rock! - Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2008-03-07 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080310230834/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1192245-_girls_rock/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] reported the film had an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 7 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/girlsrock |title=Girls Rock!

'''''Goldie and the Boxer''''' is a [[made-for-television film]] starring [[O. J. Simpson]] as Joe Gallagher, a down-on-his luck [[boxer]] whose life and career undergo a change when an orphaned, little girl named Goldie ([[Melissa Michaelsen]]) is left in his care. The production was broadcast on the [[NBC]] television network on December 30, 1979.

While being panned by critics, it was a solid ratings hit and led to a sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogle|first1=Donald|title=Blacks in American Films and Television|date=1988|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|location=New York &amp; London|isbn=0-8240-8715-1|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://londondance.com/articles/features/greenwich-dance-agency-the-first-10-years/|title=Greenwich Dance Agency - the first 10 years - LondonDance|work=LondonDance|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Greenwich Dance operates from The Borough Hall, the former [[Seat of local government|town hall]] of the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://manchesterhistory.net/architecture/1930/greenwichTH.html|title=Greenwich Town Hall (former), London|website=manchesterhistory.net|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Greenwich Dance is a [[registered charity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1029506&amp;subid=0|title=Charity Details|website=beta.charitycommission.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and receives regular funding from [[Arts Council England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/our-investment-2015-18/national-portfolio-organisations|title=National Portfolio Organisations {{!}} Arts Council England|website=www.artscouncil.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Royal Borough of Greenwich.

Greenwich Dance is based in The Borough Hall, a historic Art Deco building in the heart of West Greenwich.

== Historic usage of The Borough Hall ==
The Borough Hall was designed by [[architect]] Clifford Culpin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1213855|title=THE BOROUGH HALL AND MERIDIAN HOUSE (FORMER GREENWICH TOWN HALL), Greenwich - 1213855{{!}} Historic England|last=England|first=Historic|website=historicengland.org.uk|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and built in 1938-1939, and acted as the town hall for the [[Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich]] until a local authority merger in 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-05-18|title=Royal Borough of Greenwich|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Royal_Borough_of_Greenwich&amp;oldid=780923200|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in the relocation of the Borough's town hall to Woolwich. The building was split into two in 1972-1974&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://manchesterhistory.net/architecture/1930/greenwichTH.html|title=Greenwich Town Hall (former), London|website=manchesterhistory.net|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with [[Greenwich School of Management]] operating out of offices now named Meridian House.  

The Borough Hall remained vacant until 1993 when Greenwich Dance began to operate from the venue. The building is [[Grade I and II* listed buildings in Greenwich|Grade-II* listed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1213855|title=THE BOROUGH HALL AND MERIDIAN HOUSE (FORMER GREENWICH TOWN HALL), Greenwich - 1213855{{!}} Historic England|last=England|first=Historic|website=historicengland.org.uk|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The band [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] performed their first gig at The Borough Hall in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/squeeze-debut-gig|title=Squeeze debut gig|website=London Remembers|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[PRS for Music]] erected a [[blue plaque]] on the side of the building to commemorate the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prsformusic.com/press/2010/prs-for-music-honours-squeezes-first-gig|title=PRS for Music honours Squeeze's first gig|website=prsformusic.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1993 - present day ==
Since 1993, Greenwich Dance has operated the building on behalf of the owner, the Royal Borough of Greenwich. Nowadays the building hosts daily classes for professional dance artists, evening classes, events, performances and workshops.  

The Borough Hall today contains three functional dance studios - The Borough Hall, The Minor Hall, and Studio 3&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rehearsalspacefinder.com/listing/greenwich-dance-the-borough-hall-royal-hill-se10-8re-the-borough-hall/|title=Greenwich Dance - The Borough Hall - Rehearsal Space Finder|work=Rehearsal Space Finder|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Borough Hall, the largest of the three, has a stage and an original 21m x 21m semi-sprung dance floor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rehearsalspacefinder.com/listing/greenwich-dance-the-borough-hall-royal-hill-se10-8re-the-borough-hall/|title=Greenwich Dance - The Borough Hall - Rehearsal Space Finder|work=Rehearsal Space Finder|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was originally constructed in the 1930s as a social dance floor. As part of the organisation's support for professional dance artists, rehearsal spaces are hired out at reduced rates for independent dance artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://londondance.com/directory/dance-resources/studio-space-space-xchange/greenwich-dance/|title=Greenwich Dance - LondonDance|work=LondonDance|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Borough Hall also houses the offices of other prominent local arts organisations, including [[Protein Dance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proteindance.co.uk/contact/|title=Protein Dance :: Contact|website=www.proteindance.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Greenwich+Docklands International Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival.org/about/contact/|title=Contact us - Greenwich+Docklands International Festival|website=www.festival.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Each year, Greenwich Dance produce two festivals as part of the [[Royal Greenwich Festivals]] - Greenwich Dances&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/24545/greenwichs-series-summer-festivals-kicks-literary-family-fun/|title=Greenwich's series of summer festivals kicks of with literary and family fun|last=Little|first=Mandy|date=2017-05-22|work=London News Online|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Greenwich World Cultural Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visitgreenwich.org.uk/events/greenwich-world-cultural-festival-2016/|title=Greenwich World Cultural Festival 2016|work=Visit Greenwich|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; (based at [[Eltham Palace]]). These are delivered on behalf of Royal Borough of Greenwich, the commissioners of Royal Greenwich Festivals. 

== Role as Big Dance Hub ==
Acknowledging its role as the dance provider for South East London, in 2010 [[Big Dance UK|Big Dance]] commissioned Greenwich Dance &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bigdance.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/big-dance_press-release_20012010-2-Copy.pdf|title=Big Dance 2010 press release|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to act as the Big Dance Hub for the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]], [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]], Greenwich and [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]].

A '''hanging scroll''' is one of the many traditional ways to display and exhibit East Asian painting and calligraphy. The hanging scroll was displayed in a room for appreciation; it is to be distinguished from the [[handscroll]], which was narrower and designed to be viewed flat on a table in sections and then stored away again.

Hanging scrolls are generally intended to be displayed for short periods of time and are then rolled up to be tied and secured for storage.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{cite web|title=A Look at Chinese Painting|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Chinese/html_pages/glossary.htm#thirty
|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hanging scrolls are rotated according to season or occasion, and such works are never intended to be on permanent display.&lt;ref name=andrews&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Julia F.|title=Painters and politics in the People's Republic of China: 1949 - 1979|year=1994|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=232|isbn=978-0-520-07981-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h3kDsTxGSJMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting surface of the paper or silk can be mounted with decorative [[brocade]] silk borders.&lt;ref name=met/&gt; In the composition of a hanging scroll, the foreground is usually at the bottom of the scroll  while the middle and far distances are at the middle and top respectively.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;

The traditional craft involved in creating a hanging scroll is considered an art in itself.&lt;ref name=sze/&gt; Mountings for Chinese paintings can be divided into a few types, such as handscrolls, hanging scrolls, album leaves, and [[Folding screen|screen]]s amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|title=The arts|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-869137-2|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4FUAAAAMAAJ|edition=updated impression}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the hanging scroll the actual painting is mounted on paper, and provided at the top with a stave, to which is attached a hanging cord, and at the bottom with a roller.

==History==
Scrolls originated in their earliest form from literature and other texts written on [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo strips]] and [[silk]] banners across ancient China.&lt;ref name=sze/&gt;&lt;ref name=dillon/&gt; The earliest hanging scrolls are related to and developed from silk banners in early Chinese history.&lt;ref name=sze/&gt;&lt;ref name=wash&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Aspects of Painting|url=http://depts.washington.edu/chinaciv/painting/4ptgtech.htm|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sullivan/&gt; These banners were long and hung vertically on walls.&lt;ref name=sze/&gt; Such silk banners and hanging scroll paintings were found at [[Mawangdui]] dating back to the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE – 220 CE).&lt;ref name=wash/&gt;&lt;ref name=sullivan&gt;{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Michael|title=The arts of China|year=1984|publisher=University of California Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-520-04918-5|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CzdICSqnELkC|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907), the aesthetic and structural objectives for hanging scrolls were summarized, which are still followed to this day.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; During the early [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), the scrolls became well suited to the art styles of the artists,&lt;ref name=dillon&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillon|first=Michael|title=China: A historical and cultural dictionary|year=1998|publisher=Curzon|location=Richmond|isbn=978-0-7007-0439-2|page=273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VA5tKw11K8YC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wash/&gt; consequently hanging scrolls were made in many different sizes and proportions.&lt;ref name=sze/&gt;

Originally introduced to Japan from China as a means of spreading [[Buddhism]], it has found a place in Japanese culture and art and plays an important role in interior decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Hanging Scroll(2018)| url = https://ateliers-japon.com/#hangingscroll | publisher=Les Ateliers de Japon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The hanging scroll provides an artist with a vertical format to display his art on a wall.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;&lt;ref name=dillon/&gt; It is one of the most common types of scrolls for Chinese [[Chinese painting|painting]] and [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]].&lt;ref name=qu&gt;{{cite book|last=Qu|first=Lei Lei|title=The simple art of Chinese brush painting|year=2008|publisher=Sterling|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4027-5391-6|pages=58–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGFRtpz5WmYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horizontal hanging scrolls are also very frequently used and a common form.&lt;ref name=qu/&gt; The hanging scroll is different from the handscroll in that the latter is not hung. The handscroll is a long narrow scroll for displaying a series of scenes in Chinese painting.&lt;ref name=dillon/&gt;&lt;ref name=qu/&gt; This scroll is intended to be viewed section for section during the unrolling and flat on a table,&lt;ref name=qu/&gt; which is in contrast to a hanging scroll that is appreciated in its entirety while guiding the eyes through the artwork.&lt;ref name=sze&gt;{{cite book|last=Sze|first=Mai-Mai|title=The Tao of painting|year=1957|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=62–65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zJ89AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wash/&gt;

==Styles==
There are several hanging scroll styles for mounting, such as:
* '''Yisebiao''' (一色裱, one color mount)&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;
* '''Ersebiao''' (二色裱, two color mount)&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;
* '''Sansebiao''' (三色裱, three color mount)&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;
* '''Xuanhezhuang''' (宣和裝, [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Xuanhe]] style),&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;&lt;ref name=npmsong&gt;{{cite web|title=宣和装|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/dm/album/htm/note005.htm|publisher=National Palace Museum|accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Songshibiao''' (宋式裱, [[Song Dynasty|Song]] dynasty mount)&lt;ref name=npmsong/&gt;

==Arrangements and formats==

Besides the previous styles of hanging scroll mountings, there are a few additional ways to format the hanging scroll.

*'''Thin strip paintings''' (條幅畫)
:Narrow strip paintings intended for smaller rooms and spaces.

*'''Hall paintings''' (中堂畫)
:Hall paintings are intended to be the centerpiece in the main hall.&lt;ref name=qu/&gt; It's usually quite a large hanging scroll that serves as a focal point in an interior and often has a complicated subject.&lt;ref name=qu/&gt;

*'''Four hanging scrolls''' (四條屏)
:These hanging scrolls were developed from [[Folding screen|screen paintings]].&lt;ref name=qu/&gt; It features several narrow and long hanging scrolls and is usually hung next to each other on a wall, but can also be hung on its own.&lt;ref name=qu/&gt; The subjects have related themes,&lt;ref name=qu/&gt; such as the flowers of the four seasons, the ''[[Four Gentlemen]]'' ([[orchid]], [[bamboo]], [[chrysanthemum]], [[plum blossom]]), the  ''[[Four Beauties]]'' (ladies renowned for their beauty).

*'''Panoramic screen''' (通景屏)
:The panoramic screen consists of several hanging scrolls that have continuous images, in which the subject continues further in another scroll.&lt;ref name=qu/&gt; These hanging scrolls cover large areas of a wall and usually do not have a border in between.&lt;ref name=qu/&gt;

*'''Couplet''' (對聯)
:A [[Couplet (Chinese poetry)|couplet]] is two hanging scrolls placed side by side or accompanying a scroll in the middle. These are with poetic calligraphy in [[vertical writing]]. This style came to popularity during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Approaching "Pride of China": Understanding Chinese Calligraphy and Painting.|url=http://www.english.cciv.cityu.edu.hk/website/?redirect=/pride_of_china/|publisher=Chinese Civilisation Centre|accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features and materials==

Chinese mounting and conservation techniques are considered a traditional craft and are believed to have developed around 2,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Valerie|author2=Gu, Xiangmei |author3=Hou, Yuan-Li |title=The treatment of Chinese ancestor portraits: An introduction to Chinese painting conservation techniques|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|year=2003|volume=42|issue=3|pages=463–477|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic42-03-007.html|accessdate=16 August 2011|doi=10.2307/3179868}}&lt;/ref&gt; This craft is considered an art onto itself.&lt;ref name=sze/&gt; Careful attention was and still is paid to ensure the quality and variety of the silk and paper to protect and properly fit the artwork onto the mounting, as it gives form to the art.&lt;ref name=sze/&gt; The art is fixed onto a four-sided inlay, made from paper or silk, thus providing a border.&lt;ref name=sze/&gt;

The artwork in the middle of the scroll is called ''huaxin'' (畫心; literally "painted heart").&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; There is sometimes a section above the artwork called a ''shitang'' (詩塘; literally "poetic pool"), which is usually reserved for inscriptions onto the work of art, ranging from a short verse to poems and other inscriptions.&lt;ref name=dillon/&gt; These inscriptions are often done by people other than the artist.&lt;ref name=dillon/&gt; Although inscriptions can also be placed onto the material of the artwork itself.&lt;ref name=wash/&gt; The upper part of the scroll is called ''tiantou'' (天頭; symbolizing "Heaven") and the lower part is called ''ditou'' (地頭; symbolizing "Earth").&lt;ref name=npm/&gt;&lt;ref name=sze/&gt;

At the top of the scroll is a thin wooden bar, called ''tiangan'' (天杆), on which a cord is attached for hanging the scroll.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;  Two decorative strips, called ''jingyan'' (惊燕; literally "frighten swallows"), are sometimes attached to the top of the scroll.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;&lt;ref name=sze/&gt; At the bottom of the scroll is a wooden cylindrical bar, called ''digan'' (地杆), attached to give the scroll the necessary weight to hang properly onto a wall, but it also serves to roll up a scroll for storage when the artwork is not in display.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;&lt;ref name=met/&gt;&lt;ref name=sze/&gt;&lt;ref name=spielvogel&gt;{{cite book|last=Spielvogel|first=Jackson J.|title=The essential world history, Volume 1: To 1800|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0-495-90291-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AxWLxjyOUooC|edition=6th|page=258|author2=Duiker, William J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two knobs at the far ends of the lower wooden bar are called ''zhoutou'' (軸頭) and help to ease the rolling of the scroll.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; These could be ornamented with a variety of materials, such as jade, ivory, or horn.&lt;ref name=sze/&gt;

==Method and processes==
Traditional scroll mounters go through a lengthy process of backing the mounting silks with paper using paste before creating the borders for the scroll. Afterwards, the whole scroll is backed before the roller and fittings are attached. The whole process can take two weeks to nine months depending on how long the scroll is left on the wall to dry and stretch before finishing by polishing the back with [[Chinese wax]] and fitting the rod and roller at either end. This process is generally called 'wet mounting' due to the use of wet paste in the process.

In the late 20th century a new method was created called 'dry mounting' which involves the use of heat activated [[silicone]] sheets in lieu of paste which reduced the amount of time from a few weeks to just a few hours. This new method is generally used for mass-produced artwork rather than serious art or conservation as mounting done this way tends not to be as robust as wet mounting whose scrolls can last for over a century before it requires remounting.

[[File:Hereford-Karte.jpg|thumb|350px|Hereford mappa mundi]]
The '''Hereford Mappa Mundi''' is a medieval map of the known world ([[mappa mundi]] in Latin), of a form deriving from the [[T and O map|T and O]] pattern, &lt;!-- see "Mappa mundi#Complex maps" --&gt; dating from c. 1300. It is displayed at [[Hereford Cathedral]] in [[Hereford]], England.&lt;ref name="Edson 1997"&gt;Edson, Evelyn (1997) ''Mapping Time and Space: How Medieval Mapmakers Viewed Their World'', The British Library&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest medieval map still known to exist.

The  Hereford Mappa Mundi hung, with little regard, for many years on a wall of a choir aisle in the cathedral. During the troubled times of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] the map had been laid beneath the floor of Bishop Audley's Chantry, where it remained secreted for some time. In 1855 it was cleaned and repaired at the [[British Museum]]. During the Second World War, for safety reasons, the mappa mundi and other valuable manuscripts from [[Hereford Cathedral Library]] were kept elsewhere and returned to the collection in 1946.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hereford Mappa Mundi: Journey to Hereford|last=Alington|first=Gabriel|publisher=Cromwell Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Trowbridge, Wiltshire|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, a financial crisis in the [[Diocese of Hereford]] caused the Dean and Chapter to propose selling the mappa mundi.&lt;ref name="Driver1988"&gt;{{cite news|title=World time forgot: the 13th-century world map up for sale is not the only neglected treasure of Hereford Cathedral|last=Driver|first=Christopher|date=19 November 1988|publisher=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much controversy, large donations from the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]], [[Paul Getty]] and members of the public kept the map in Hereford and allowed the construction of a new library to house the map and the chained libraries from the Cathedral and All Saints' Church. The new Library Building in the south east corner of the [[cathedral close]] opened in 1996.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An open-access high-resolution digital image of the map with more than 1,000 place and name annotations is included among the thirteen medieval maps of the world edited in the [[Virtual Mappa]] project.

== Features ==
Drawn on a single sheet of [[vellum]], it measures 158&amp;nbsp;cm by 133&amp;nbsp;cm,&lt;ref name="Edson 1997"/&gt; some {{convert|52|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter and is the largest medieval map known still to exist.&lt;!-- other sources: 165x135cm --&gt; The writing is in black ink, with additional red and gold, and blue or green for water (with the [[Red Sea]] (8) coloured red). It depicts 420 towns, 15 Biblical events, 33 animals and plants, 32 people, and five scenes from classical mythology.&lt;ref name="Edson 1997"/&gt;

[[Jerusalem]] is drawn at the centre of the circle; east is on top, showing the [[Garden of Eden]] in a circle at the edge of the world (1). Great Britain is drawn at the northwestern border (bottom left, 22 &amp; 23). Curiously, the labels for Africa and Europe are reversed, with Europe scribed in red and gold as "Africa", and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Edson 1997"/&gt;

The map is based on traditional accounts and earlier maps such as the one of the [[Beatus of Liébana]] codex, and is very similar to the [[Ebstorf map]], the [[Psalter world map]], and the ''Sawley'' (erroneously for considerable time called "Henry of Mainz") map; it does not correspond to the geographical knowledge of the 14th century. Note, for example, that the [[Caspian Sea]] (5) connects to the encircling ocean (upper left). This is in spite of [[William of Rubruk]]'s having reported it to be landlocked in 1255, i.e. several decades before the map's creation; see also [[Portolan chart]].

The "T and O" shape does not imply that its creators believed in a [[flat Earth]]. &lt;!-- remember quadripartite Beatus-style maps with "antipodes", on this! --&gt;The [[Spherical Earth|spherical shape of the Earth]] was already known to the [[Classical antiquity|ancient Greeks and Romans]] and the idea was never entirely forgotten even in the [[Middle Ages]], and thus the circular representation may well be considered a conventional attempt at a [[map projection|projection]]: in spite of the acceptance of a spherical Earth, only the known parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] were believed to be inhabitable by human beings (see [[antipodes]]), so that the circular representation remained adequate. The long river on the far right is the [[River Nile]], too (12), and the T shape is established by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (19-21-25) and the rivers [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] (13) and Nile (16). It is the first map to mention the [[Faroe Islands]].

== Authorship ==
The map is signed by or attributed to one "Richard of Haldingham and [[Sleaford|Lafford]]", also known as Richard de Bello, "[[prebend]] of Lafford in Lincoln Cathedral". However, this attribution isn't completely agreed upon, it being suggested that the exquisite level of detail included in the map could not have been completed by one person. Some people believe that the map was originally created by Richard of Haldingham and Lafford and that at his death it passed to his younger cousin, Richard de Bello. Once it was in de Bello's possession, de Bello and his patron Richard Swindfield worked on the map.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Great Maps: The World's Masterpieces Explored and Explained|last=Brotton|first=Jerry|publisher=DK Publishing|year=2014|isbn=1465424636|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was for long believed the map was not created in Hereford. It was believed to have been made in [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], since the city of Lincoln is drawn in considerable detail, being represented by a cathedral located on a hill near a river. Hereford, on the other hand, is represented only by a cathedral and seems an afterthought, drawn by a different hand than many of the other things on the map.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mappa Mundi: The Hereford World Map|last=Harvey|first=P. D. A.|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent research, including the origin of wood used for the frame which corresponds with a compass hole in the map, suggests it may have in fact been created in or around Hereford.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-32900232&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
{{Islam}}
'''Sin''' is an important concept in [[Islamic ethics]]. [[Muslim]]s see [[sin]] as anything that goes against the commands of [[Allah]] ([[God in Islam|God]]), a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2211|work=Sin|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]] teaches that sin is an act and not a state of being. It is believed that Allah weighs an individual’s good deeds and against his or her sins on the Day of Judgement and punishes those individuals whose evil deeds outweigh their good deeds. These individuals are thought to be sentenced to afterlife in the fires of جهنم [[jahannam]] (Hell).

The Quran describes these sins throughout the text and demonstrates that some sins are more punishable than others. A clear distinction is made between major and minor sins (53:31–32), indicating that if an individual stays away from the major sins, then he/she will be forgiven of the minor sins.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies" /&gt;{{Notinsource|date=January 2017}} Regardless, Islam teaches that God is merciful and individuals can be forgiven of their sins if they repent.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies" /&gt;{{Notinsource|date=January 2017}}

Sources differ on the exact meanings of the different terms for sin used in the Islamic tradition.

== Terminology ==

A number of different words for sin are used in the Islamic tradition.

According to A.J. Wensinck's entry in the [[Encyclopedia of Islam]], Islamic terms for sin include ''dhanb'' and ''khaṭīʾa'', which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins; ''khiṭʾ'', which means simply a sin; and ''ithm'', which is used for grave sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Wensinck, A. J. | year= 2012 | title=K̲h̲aṭīʾa |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/2214-871X_ei1_SIM_4141|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cyril Glasse, Islam recognizes two kinds of sin (''khati'ah''): ''dhanb'', a fault or shortcoming which is to be sanctioned; and ''ithm'', a willful transgression which is to be punished.&lt;ref name=glasse-431&gt;{{cite book|last=Glasse|first=Cyril|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|publisher=Altamira|page=431|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;pg=PA431 |quote=In Islam sin is divided into two categories. The first is that of ''dhanb'', which is a fault or shortcoming, a limitation, an inadvertencies, the consequence of which is a sanction rather than a punishment. Sin as ''dhanb'' is distinguished from willful transgression (''ithm''), which is more serious and clearly incurs punishment rather than sanction. ... The term ''khati'ah'' is used in practice indiscriminately for both concepts of sin. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantic analysis of terminology in the Qur'an==

Several different words are used in the Quran to describe sin—1) ''Dhanb'' 2) ''Ithm'' 3) ''Khati’ah'' 4) ''Jurm'' 5) ''Junah/Haraj''. By examining the choice of words in Quranic verses used in connection with these terms, scholars have attempted to determine which sins are associated with which terms.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ituzsu|first=Toshiko|title=Ethico-Religious Concepts in the Qur'an|year=1966|publisher=McGill University Press|location=Montreal|pages=193–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dhanb===

''Dhanb'' (plural ''dhunub'') is frequently applied to heinous sins committed against God. One of the main examples of ''Dhanb'' in the Quran is of “crying lies of God’s signs”, or having excessive pride that prevents an individual from believing the signs of God.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko"/&gt;

{{quote|For in God's sight are (all) his servants, (namely), those who say: 'Our Lord, we have indeed believed: forgive us, then, our sins ("dhunub"), and save us from the agony of the Fire.' | Quran 3: 15–16&lt;ref name="AliAdbullah"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Adbullah Yusuf|title=The Holy Qur'an|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This use of ''dhanb'' in the Quran exemplifies that this type of sin is punishable in the afterlife. In fact, ''dhanb'' is considered a ‘great’ sin and is often used in the Quran to contrast with ''sayyi’a'', which denotes a ‘smaller’ sin.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; The Quran states that if you avoid these great sins, your lesser evil deeds or sayyi’at will be forgiven.

{{quote| If you avoid great sins (kaba’ir or dhanb) which are forbidden you, We will remit from you your evil deeds (sayyi’a). | Quran 4: 31 &lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; }}

=== Ithm===

Some scholars believe the basic meaning of ''ithm'' to be an unlawful deed that is committed intentionally. This contrasts to ''dhanb'' in that ''dhanb'' can be both intentional and unintentional. However, this definition is somewhat nebulous and the best description of the word is based on the contextual situations.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; In the Quran, i''thm'' is found quite frequently in legislative descriptions. For example, falsely accusing your own wife in order to gain money is constituted as an ''ithm'' (Quran 4: 24/20). However, ''ithm'' is also used in connection with ''haram'', or committing an unlawful deed, a taboo, such as consuming food or drink that is forbidden by God:

{{quote|They will ask thee about wine and [[maisir|maysir]]. Say, ‘In both of them there is great sin (ithm) and also some uses for men, but their sin is greater than their usefulness.’| Quran 2: 168/173&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; }}

''Ithm'' is also associated with what is considered the worst sin of all, ''shirk''.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; ''Shirk'' signifies the accepting of a presence of other divinities at the side of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brill Encyclopedia of Islam|year=1997|publisher=Leiden Brill|pages=484–486}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran states that:

{{quote|He who associates with God has surely forged a great sin (''ithm'').| Quran 4: 53/50 &lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;}}

This association with ''shirk'' is noteworthy for ''shirk'' is considered unforgivable if not repented of.

{{quote|God forgiveth not (the sin of) joining other gods to Him; but He forgiveth whom He pleaseth other sins that this: one who joins other gods with God hath strayed far, far away. | Quran 4:116&lt;ref name="AliAdbullah" /&gt;}}

=== Khati’ah===

''Khati’ah'' is considered by many scholars to be a “moral lapse” or a “mistake” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brill Encyclopedia of Islam|year=1997|publisher=Leiden Brill|pages=1106–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|need volume or entry to verify|date=July 2017}} This interpretation has led some scholars to believe that ''Khati’ah'' is a lesser sin than ithm; however, the word ''Khati’ah'' is frequently used in conjunction with ''ithm'' in the Quran.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko"/&gt;

{{quote| Whoso, having committed a ''khati’ah'' or an ''ithm'', throws it upon the innocent, has burdened himself with calumny and an obvious sin (''ithm''). | Quran 4:112&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;}}

This Quranic verse indicates that ''khati’ah'' is considered an ''ithm'', a grave sin. In fact, the word ''khati’ah'' is associated with some of the most heinous religious sins in the Quran.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; In one Quranic verse this word is used to describe the sin of slaying one’s own children for fear of poverty. (Quran 17:33/31). Scholars believe that ''dhanb'' or ''ithm'' could be used in place of ''khati’ah'' in this instance;&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; however, the word choice indicates that ''khati’ah'' is more than just a moral lapse or mistake and is punishable.

=== Jurm===

The word ''Jurum'' is often considered to be a synonym of '''''dhanb''''' for it is used to describe some of the same sins: crying lies of God and not believing the signs of God.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; In the Quran, the word mostly appears in the form of ''mujrim'', one who commits a ''jurm''. These individuals are described in the Quran as having arrogance towards the believers.

{{quote| Behold, those who commit jurm used to laugh at those who believed, winking one at another when they passed them by, and when they went back to their own fold, they returned jesting, and when they saw them they used to say, ‘Lo, these have indeed gone astray! | Quran 83: 29–32&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;}}

=== Junah/Haraj===

''Junah'' and ''Haraj'' have a similar meaning to that of ''ithm'', a sin that warrants a punishment. In fact, these words are used almost interchangeably with ''ithm'' in the same chapters in the Quran. Like ''ithm'', these words are found frequently in legislative portions of the Quran, particularly relating to regulations regarding marriage and divorce.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;

{{quote|It is no sin (''junah'') for you that you offer proposal of marriage to women or keep it secret. | Quran 2:235&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;}}

==Definition in Hadith==
Sin is discussed extensively in the [[hadith]], (the collection of [[Muhammad]]'s sayings). It is reported by An-Nawwas bin Sam'an: 
{{quote|"The Prophet (Muhammad) said, "Piety is good manner,and sin is that which creates doubt and you do not like people to know it.""|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6195}},{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6196}}}}

Wabisah bin Ma’bad reported: 
{{quote|“I went to Messenger of Allah (SAWS) and he asked me: “Have you come to inquire about piety?” I replied in the affirmative. Then he said: “Ask your heart regarding it. Piety is that which contents the soul and comforts the heart, and sin is that which causes doubts and perturbs the heart, even if people pronounce it lawful and give you verdicts on such matters again and again.”|Ahmad and Ad-Darmi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sunnah.com/nawawi40/27 | title=40 Hadith: Nawawi: 27, English translation: Hadith 27 | publisher=sunnah.com | accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]], a Hadith is narrated:
{{Quote|Allah's apostle said, "Every son of Adam sins, the best of the sinners are those who repent."|Sunan al-Tirmidhi,Hadith no. 2499}}

In [[Sahih Muslim]], [[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari]] and [[Abu Huraira]] narrated:
{{Quote|Allah's apostle said," By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if you were not to commit sin, Allah would sweep you out of existence and He would replace (you by) those people who would commit sin and seek forgiveness from Allah, and He would have pardoned them."|{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|37|6621}}}}

==Effects of sin==
{{List|section|date=January 2018}}
The effects of sins are so many to the extent that they are uncountable. Yet some of the effects are:
*Sin pollutes and darken human’s heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hadrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad |title=The essence of Islam;vol.3|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=2004|publisher= Clay ltd, st Ires plc|isbn=1853727563}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sin causes various types of Corruption in the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=The University of Virginia|title= The Islamic Review |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=2008|publisher= Ahmadiyyah Anjuman Ishaat Islam,Lahore Incorporated }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Disobedience ceased favours and blessing from Allah (both spirituals and materials) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamal Faghih Imani|title= Nur Al-Qur'an fi Tafsir Al-Qur'an|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=1996|publisher= Amir -al Momineen,Ali Library|isbn=9781933269153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Also in this regard Imam Ali said: “Even if Allah had not threatened for disobeying Him, people must not disobey Him in order to be grateful to His blessings.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Muhammad ibn al-Husayn Sharif al-Radi|title=Nahjul Balagha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=1984 |publisher=Tahrike Tarsile Quran|isbn=9780940368422}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Disobedience of Allah increased heart's diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Muhammad Ja'far |title=Minaret monthly international;vol. 15,issues 9-12|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=1976|publisher=World federation of Islamic Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Qur'an refers to the sinners as "the greatest loser". {Qur'an, 18:103-105}
*It brings about displeasure of God and his messenger, as quoted by Imam as-Sadiq when he addressed a group of people and inquired why they annoyed the Messenger of Allah. Someone asked Imam (‘a) how they did so, and he (‘a) said: "Do you not know that your deeds are reported to him (S)? When he (S) observes a sin against Allah among them, he becomes displeased.

==Consequences of some sins==
{{List|section|date=January 2018}}
There are some sins which its ill-consequences were stated in the Qur'an and hadith, we shall quote some of them here: 
*Imam al-Baqir, quoted the Holy Prophet been stated seven consequences for different sins as thus:  
#"When adultery appears (abundantly in a society) the (number of) sudden deaths increases; 
#when there is fraud, Allah takes them in expensiveness and loss. When people stop giving alms tax, the earth holds back its blessings from plants (crops), fruits, mines, and all such things. 
#When they act unjustly according to (divine) ordinances, they have helped injustice and aggression. 
#When they breach (their) promises, the Lord will set their enemies as absolute masters over them.
#When they break off connections with their kindred, possession of properties will be put in the hands of the wicked. And, 
#When they do not perform enjoining right and forbidding wrong and, also, do not follow the chosen ones of my Ahlul Bayt, Allah will set their vicious ones over them and, in this condition, their good doers utter invocations but they are not responded to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Laleh Bakhtiar|title= A Glance at the life of the holy Prophet of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=1983|publisher= Islamic Propagation Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The holy Qur'an,chapter 4 verse 10 said in this regard as thus: “(As for) those who swallow the property of the orphans unjustly, surely they only swallow fire into their bellies and they shall enter burning fire.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Khwajah Kamal al-Din |title= The Islamic review,vol.17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=1929|publisher= The University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Concealing part of the holy book is among the sin which its consequences were stated in the Qur'an;as it was said in Qur'an 2:174-175:“Surely those who conceal any part of the Book that Allah has revealed and take for it a small price, they eat nothing but fire into their bellies, and Allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement. These are they who buy error for the right direction and chastisement for forgiveness ; how bold they are to encounter fire!” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Maulana Muhammad Ali|title= English translation of the holy Quran with Explanatory notes|url=&lt;!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 --a different book--&gt;|year=|publisher= Amazon.com|isbn=1906109079}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Imam Zaynol Aabideen stated some sins ant their consequences as thus:
#“The sins that remove blessings are: oppressing people, giving up doing good and favor, being ungrateful for blessings and giving up thanking Allah.
#The sins that cause regret are: killing innocent ones, breaking off relations with the kin until they feel in no need of each other, not offering prayer until its time elapses, being inadvertent to wills and to wronged people, not giving zakat until death comes. 
#The sins that bring calamities are: disobedience of a knowing one by oppressing people, being rude to them and mocking them.
#The sins that keep blessings away are: pretending poverty, sleeping until after dawn and until the time of Fajr Prayer elapses, scorning blessings and complaining against Allah the Almighty." &lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|author=Allama Hussayn Ansariyan|title= Repentance; The Cradle of mercy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=|publisher= Ansariyan, Qom|isbn=9789644385858}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Also he stated: 
#"The sins that disgrace honors are: drinking wine, gambling, joking and talking nonsense, mentioning the defects of people and accompanying sinful and bad people.
#The sins that bring calamities are: refraining from helping needy people, refraining from supporting oppressed people, not enjoining what is right and not forbidding what is wrong.  
#The sins that cause the enemies to prevail are: doing injustice openly, spreading debauchery, violating prohibited matters, disobeying good people and submitting to evil people. 
#The sins that hasten perishment are: cutting communications with one’s kin, false oath, lying, adultery, blocking the ways of the Muslims and pretending to be an Imam falsely.
#The sins that dispel hope are: being desperate of the mercy of Allah, relying on other than Allah and disbelieving in the Promise of Allah. 
#The sins that darken the space are: magic, divination, believing in stars, disbelieving in fate and being undutiful to one’s parents. #The sins that uncover the curtain (of the unseen) are: borrowing with no intention of repaying, exceeding in spending on impermissible things, being stingy with one’s family, children and relatives, impoliteness, impatience, laziness and making little of religious people." &lt;ref name= "book" /&gt; 
*The follows are some other sins with their consequences : 
#"The sins that reject supplication are: malevolence, ill-intention, hypocrisy with brothers, disbelieving in responding to supplication, delaying obligatory prayers until their prescribed times elapse, giving up approaching Allah via doing good and paying charities, and using bad and obscene sayings. 
#The sins that prevent the rain of the heaven are: the injustice of rulers in judgments, perjury, concealing true witnesses, preventing zakat, preventing loan and helping the needy, hard-Heartedness towards the poor and the needy, being unjust to orphans and widows, chiding the beggars them.”  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= (Edited by) John Andrew Morrrow |title= Islamic Images and Ideas,Essays on Sacred Symbolism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=2013|publisher= Amazon|isbn=1476612889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repentance of sin==
{{See also|Repentance in Islam}} 
According to Islam, one can be forgiven of sins through genuine ''[[tawbah]]'' (repentance) which literally means "to return."

{{quote|Ask your Lord for forgiveness, then turn back to Him.| Qur'an, sura 11, ayat 3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|11|3|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unlike the Catholic concept of atonement, ''[[tawbah]]'' does not entail formal, [[ecclesiastical|eccelesiastica]]l confession to a religious leader.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/|work=Repentance|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Protestantism, Islam allows followers to repent directly to God. In addition, while Christianity and Islam considers humans as prone to sin, Islam ultimately views them as responsible for their actions and refutes the Christian concept of original sin.

{{quote|For man's very soul incites him to evil unless my Lord shows mercy.| Qur'an, sura 12, ayat 53&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|12|53|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

More so, in Islam Muslims are discouraged from confessing their sins and sharing the wrongdoings of others.
&lt;ref name="hidesins_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sins: to hide or to make public|url=http://islamicetiquette.wordpress.com/category/hide-your-sins|work=Islamic Etiquette|publisher=Islamic Etiquette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, according to Islam, [[Blood sacrifice]] cannot add to [[Divine Grace]] nor replace the necessity of repentance. However, sacrifice is done to help the poor and to remember [[Abraham]]’s willingness to sacrifice his son at [[Islamic concept of God|God]]'s command.
{{quote|It is not their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah. it is your piety that reaches Him..."| Qur'an, sura 22, ayat 37&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|22|37|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When a human has violated another human’s rights, ḥuqūq al-ʿibād, compensation is necessary in order to show that one has made amends.

When a human has offended or disobeyed God, ḥuqūq Allāh, penitence, remorse, and resolution are necessary in order to show that one is sincere, and will not repeat the wrongdoing in the future.

According to Shaddad ibn Aws:
{{quote|Shall I not how to seek forgiveness? O Allah, You are my Lord, there is no God but You; for You created me and I am Your servant; and I am upon Your covenant and Your promise as much as I am able; I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I have done; I acknowledge Your favors upon me and I recognize my sins, so forgive my sins; verily, none can forgive sins but You.| Sunan At-Tirmidhi, Book of Supplications, Number 3393, Hasan&lt;ref&gt;Hadith, Sunan At-Tirmidhi, Book of Supplications, Number 3393&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From a traditionalist perspective, sin is applied to an individual’s actions. Through belief and good works, an individual can remove his/her sin and attain God’s good favor. 
Classical legal scholar Muhammad al-Shafi'i (767 – 820) derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as:&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies_a" /&gt;

{{quote|But He will overlook the bad deeds of those who have faith, do good deeds, and believe in what has been sent down to Muhammad —the truth from their Lord —and He will put them into a good state.| Qur'an, sura 47, ayat 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|47|2|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From a modernist perspective, sin has also been applied to a group or community’s collective behavior. Through public acknowledgement of wrongdoing, people can take responsibility for the lack of morality within their society and enact social reform. Egyptian reformer Muḥammad ʿAbduh (1849–1905) and his disciple Muḥammad Rashīd Ridā (1865–1935) derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as:&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies_a" /&gt;

{{quote|Unless they repent, make amends, and declare the truth. I will certainly accept their repentance.| Qur'an, sura 2, ayat 160&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|160|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other modern reformers, such as [[Sayyid Qutb]], held that repentance involved a renewed, holistic commitment to Islam, rather than admission of sin for the sake of being pardoned of punishment. This understanding draws from classical Sufi thought, whereby one experiences a personality transformation and his/her sinful impulses are replaced by virtue.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies_a" /&gt; Qutb derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as:

{{quote|Those who repent, believe, and do good deeds: God will change the evil deeds of such people into good ones.| Qur'an, sura 25 ayat 70&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|25|70|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Repentance for sin can be accomplished through acts such as, “fasting, giving charity, sacrificing an animal, and freeing a slave.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mir|first=Mustansir|title=Dictionary of Quranic Terms and Concepts|year=1987|publisher=Garland Publishing|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, going on the [[hajj]] can serve as a form of repentance.

According to Shaddad ibn Aws:
{{quote|The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said, “The lesser pilgrimage unto the lesser pilgrimage will expiate whatever sins were committed between them; and the accepted pilgrimage has no reward other than Paradise.| Sahih Bukhari, Book 27, Number 1 &lt;ref&gt;Hadith, Sahih Bukhari, Book 27, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, regardless of one's outward deeds, God does not accept the forgiveness of those who are insincere in their repentance and only do so in order to avoid [[jahannam]].

{{quote|It is not true repentance when people continue to do evil until death confronts them and then say, ‘Now I repent.| 
Qur'an, sura 4 [[ayat]] 18&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|18|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Major sins: Al-Kabirah==

The most heinous sins in Islam are known as Al-Kabirah ({{lang-fa|گناه کبیره}}) which translates to the great or major one. Some authors use the term enormity. While every sin is seen as an offense to Allah, the al-Kaba'ir are the gravest of the offenses.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies" /&gt; Allah’s power is thought to be only eclipsed by his mercy and thus small sins are tacitly understood to be forgiven after repentance. Not every sin is equal however and some are thought to be more spiritually damning than others. The greatest of the sins described as al-Kaba'ir is the association of others with Allah or [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar differ as to how many major sins there are.
In contrasting major sins with minor sins (''al-sagha'ir''), the eighth-century [[Shafi'i]] scholar [[Al-Dhahabi]] found the [[hadith]] collections of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj]] listed seven major sins, while the tradition from [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas]] stated that there were closer to seventy major sins.
&lt;ref name=Siddiqui&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siddiqui|first1=Mona|title=The Good Muslim: Reflections on Classical Islamic Law and Theology|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2012|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgmjUI9s0f8C&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22difference+between+hadith+collections%22+major+sin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-1msU836HYOCqgaF4YGwAw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22difference%20between%20hadith%20collections%22%20major%20sin&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the major or al-Kaba'ir sins in Islam are as follows:&lt;ref name = "Al-Kabair-Sins"&gt;{{ISBN|1-56744-489-X}} The Major Sins Al-Kabirah By Muhammad bin 'Uthman Adh-Dhahabi, rendered into English by Mohammad Moinuddin Siddiqui&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]] (associating anything with Allah)
#Despair of Allah's mercy
#Disobeying parents
#[[Zina]] (adultery)
#[[Sodomy]]
#[[Theft]]
#Consumption of alcohol % other intoxicants
#[[Gambling]]
#[[Backbiting]] (saying bad things about a person who is not there)
#Leaving daily prayer
#[[Zakat]] evasion
#[[Witchcraft]]
#[[murder|Killing]] one whom Allah has declared inviolate without a just case
#Consuming the property of an orphan
#Devouring [[usury]]
#[[desertion|Turning back]] when the army advances
#[[False accusation]] of chaste women who are believers but indiscreet

It should be noted that these are only the opinion of particular scholars and do not wholly represent Islam.

Although many of the ideas for what is unacceptable overlap, the seven major sins of Islam differs from the seven deadly sins of Christianity. The Islamic sins refer more to specific undesirable behavior rather than to the general negative characteristics or actions of the cardinal Christian sins. Despite the similar names, the seven main sins in Islam are more comparable to the Ten Commandments rather than the seven deadly sins. They both provide the bottom line for believers in terms of what is acceptable behavior in the faith. The actions themselves differ most of the major crimes in Islam relate to subservience to Allah. Any form of polytheism is seen to be the most severe offense in the religion and all of the other transgressions are in some form of association with Allah. Witchcraft, for example, is the taking on of supernatural powers in order to make the practitioner a being above the normal human. This challenges the power of Allah as the person in question has superseded their mortal position to become something greater and akin to a god. The same can be said of murder, as ultimately the power to decide who shall live and die is believed to belong solely to Allah. Life is thought to be a gift from Allah and the unjust taking of life is a severe spiritual offense, as it is not only seen as morally wrong but also as an affront to God.

In addition to what Muslim scholars agree are the principal seven sins, the idea exists that the major sins extend far past the seven. These additional transgressions, potentially up to seventy, are not universally settled upon nor are they explicitly stated in the Qur'an, however they are thought to be implied by the text.&lt;ref name="Al-Kabair-Sins" /&gt; The supplementary sins as a whole lack the spiritual gravity of the original seven and include things such as drinking alcohol and eavesdropping.

'''Jozan rugs''' are made in the surroundings of the village [[Jowzan, Hamadan|Jozan]] in the [[Iran]]ian [[Malayer]] area. Jozan rugs are quality rugs of the [[Sarouk Rug|Sarouk]] type often with designs as early 20th century Sarouks. Jozan rugs are often called Jozan Sarouk or Malayer Sarouk in trade. In recent production the finer qualities are labelled Jozan and the less finer knotted are labelled [[Malayer]].

They are [[double-weft]]ed on a cotton foundation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1734">The '''Kilohana Art League''' was formed in 1894 as [[Honolulu]]’s first art association.  In May 1894, the woodcarver [[Augusta Graham]], the sculptor [[Allen Hutchinson]], and painters [[D. Howard Hitchcock]] and [[Annie H. Park]] created a forum where local artists could exhibit together and share ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Severson, 2002, pp. XXIV-XXV&lt;/ref&gt;  Other members included [[Alfred Richard Gurrey, Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Severson, 2002, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bessie Wheeler]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thrum's Hawaiian Annual]], Honolulu, Thos. C. Thrum, 1900, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

“Kilohana’’ is a compound word derived from two [[Hawaiian language]] words: “''kilo''” meaning to observe carefully or to spy out, and “''hana''”, meaning work.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, C. T., 1896&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kilohana Art League was disbanded in 1913, and its funds were transferred to the [[Outdoor Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;Severson, 2002, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''King Opera House''' is a performance hall located on [[Van Buren, Arkansas]]'s Main Street. Since it was built in the late 19th century, the [[opera house]]'s stage has hosted many plays and performers. The King Opera House is a contributing property to the [[Van Buren Historic District]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NRISref|2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-era]] structure first opened its doors in the late 19th century, and has since undergone extensive restoration prior to reopening for use in 1979.  The auditorium of the opera house has numerous seats on ground level, with additional seating in the balcony; all with an intricate, period-correct design.  Built for large and well-sized performances on its stage, the opera house's basement, in contrast, has two couches and two small closet-sized dressing rooms.  The basement can be highly cramped, in its relatively modest changing area and [[green room]], particularly for productions with large casts.

Founded as the '''L.G. Balfour Company''', Balfour is an operating unit of Commemorative Brands, Inc., a subsidiary of American Achievement Corporation. Balfour produces high school, college, military, and championship rings, yearbooks, caps and gowns, and graduation announcements.

==History==

===Fraternity and sorority jewelry===
Lloyd Garfield "Bally" Balfour was a native of Kentucky, where he earned his B.A. degree at the [[University of Louisville]]. He went on to obtain an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] degree from [[Indiana University]], where he became a member of [[Sigma Chi]] Fraternity in 1907. Business was of greater attraction to Balfour rather than the legal profession, and he spent five years as a traveling representative for a maker of fraternity jewelry. During that time Balfour noticed several trends in the business, including lack of standardization, poor workmanship, inferior materials, and fictitious guarantees. These issues drove Mr. Balfour to establish his own company, and he founded the L.G. Balfour Company on Friday, June 13, 1913. The business grew from a small nucleus of skilled craftsmen led by Mr. Balfour in a facility in [[Attleboro, Massachusetts]]. Lloyd Balfour's wives, Ruth who died a few years after they married and Mildred, were members of [[Pi Beta Phi]] and the L.G. Balfour Company landed Pi Beta Phi as their first sorority account when the company became the  official jeweler after a vote at the 1913 Pi Beta Phi Convention. In the early years, business was concentrated on quality fraternity and sorority products and the company earned a reputation for quality, integrity, and service. Eventually Balfour held contracts with ninety percent of all national fraternal societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316073555/http://balfourltw.sigmachi.org/faq|url=http://balfourltw.sigmachi.org/faq |title=Frequently Asked Questions &amp;#124; Balfour Leadership Training Workshop |publisher=Balfourltw.sigmachi.org |archivedate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franbecque.com/2012/03/04/with-thoughts-of-the-l-g-balfour-and-his-company/ |title=With Thoughts of L.G. Balfour and Company &amp;#124; Focus on Fraternity History |publisher=Franbecque.com |date=2012-03-04 |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product line expansion===
In 1922, Balfour set up a new department to manufacture and sell high school class rings and insignia. In 1923, Balfour introduced the first multi-year contract plans for schools.

During World War II, Balfour produced a variety of war-time medals and other products in support of our armed services. Shortly thereafter, Balfour manufactured the first press badge for the Boston Red Sox, beginning forty successive years of making ninety percent of all the baseball World Series press badges. Also, DuPont became the company's first major recognition products account.

===Monopoly charges===
In June 1961, Balfour was accused by the federal government of monopolizing the sale and distribution of fraternity and sorority jewelry and rings. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] charged that Balfour "unreasonably foreclosed competitors and potential competitors from markets, and employed other illegal practices which have restrained trade." Company president Lloyd Balfour was named in the FTC complaint, along with the Burr, Patterson &amp; Auld Company of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. Balfour owned nearly all of the stock in the Detroit-based company. The complaint charged that the two companies had negotiated "sole official jeweler" contracts with nearly all national Greek-letter organizations, including social organizations, professional organizations, and honor societies. As a result of the exclusive contracts, Balfour controlled 99 percent of jewelry sales to members of those organizations. The complaint also charged Balfour with enticing personnel away from competitors and selling or bidding below cost to drive competitors out of markets.&lt;ref&gt;"Balfour Accused of Monopolistic Jewelry Practice". ''Lawrence Journal-World''. June 26, 1961. p3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Charged with Monopoly Over Methods Used to Sell College Rings". ''The Southeast Missourian''. June 26, 1961. p2&lt;/ref&gt;

Balfour ultimately lost its case with the FTC, and its existing insignia contracts were voided in 1968. The FTC required Balfour to issue contracts going forward under new ground rules.&lt;ref&gt;"Jewelry Concern Loses F.T.C. Case". ''New York Times''. August 29, 1968. p51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Balfour began producing a much wider variety of products for sport champions. When L.G. Balfour died in 1973, the ownership of the company was placed in a trust administered by the [[Bank of New England]]. In the late 1970s, Balfour acquired the Norton Facility and Caudle Engraving in Dallas, after which the company's graphics business greatly expanded.

Thomas Wyman purchased Balfour in 1983 and opened a new ring plant shortly thereafter. In 1998, Balfour secured a three-year, $20 million corporate recognition program contract with [[AT&amp;T]]. Following the awarding of the large AT&amp;T contract, Town &amp; Country Corporation purchased Balfour in November 1988. [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]] based Town &amp; Country, a maker of fine jewelry and luxury products, planned to continue the operation of all existing Balfour facilities and leave existing Balfour management in place.&lt;ref&gt;"Chelsea Jewelry Firm to Buy Class Ring-Marker, L.G. Balfour". ''Boston Globe''. September 17, 1988. p 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of fraternity division===
In 1994, Balfour sold off its fraternal division, ending its work in the area that was responsible for the birth of the company in 1913. The division, responsible for fraternity and sorority jewelry, was sold to Buddy Cote, a longtime Balfour employee. Many existing fraternal division clients and employees followed Cote to his new business, Legacy Fine Jewelry. Legacy focused on manufacturing badges and pins and outsourced ring production to Balfour. Legacy soon ended its contractual relationship with Balfour due to difficulties between the companies, upon which Legacy turned to Masters of Design, a small firm producing rings, to supply its ring manufacturing needs. The two companies agreed to merge resulting in Legacy Fine Jewelry becoming the Legacy Division of Masters of Design.&lt;ref&gt;"Maintaining a Legacy". ''To Dragma''. Summer 2002. p18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1996, Town &amp; Country Corporation announced its plans to sell its L.G. Balfour division to CJC Holdings, Inc. for approximately $52 million. As part of the deal, Balfour would merge operations with ArtCarved, which was an operating unit of CJC Holdings, Inc. Balfour would close all Attleboro, Massachusetts operations and move 430 jobs from Attleboro to [[Austin, Texas]] at ArtCarved's headquarters. Attleboro employees that did not move to Austin were laid off. CJC Holdings, Inc. set up a new company known as Scholastic Brands, Inc. to combine the operations of Balfour and ArtCarved, and the acquisition took effect on December 16, 1996. In 1997, the name of the new parent company was changed from Scholastic Brands, Inc. to Commemorative Brands, Inc.

Commemorative Brands changed its name to American Achievement Corporation in June 2000. American Achievement Corporation, is owned by Fenway Partners, a New York based private equity firm. In 2002, American Achievement Corporation announced the acquisition of the Philadelphia-area firm, Milestone Traditions, a company specializing in the development of exclusive official ring programs. With this acquisition, Balfour, ArtCarved, Taylor Publishing, and Milestone Traditions were all combined under the American Achievement Corporation. American Achievement increased its holdings again in 2004 with the purchase of  CB Announcements, a Manhattan, Kansas provider of graduation announcements for the college market. The operations of CB announcements were consolidated with the Balfour operating division. While the L.G. Balfour Company held contracts with ninety percent of all national fraternal organizations, the Balfour brand under the American Achievement Corporation is no longer a maker of fraternity and sorority jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balfour.com/about/history/ |title=Our History - About Us |publisher=Balfour |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacecoins.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=58 |title=History of L.G.Balfour |publisher=Spacecoins.net |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the American Achievement Corporation dropped its Taylor Publishing yearbook brand in order to consolidate its yearbook operations under the stronger Balfour brand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2010/10/18/american-achievement-corp-raising.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Laughter''''' is a collection of three essays by French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]], first published in 1900. It was written in French, the original title is ''Le Rire. Essai sur la signification du comique'' ("Laughter, an essay on the meaning of the comic").

== Publication ==
The three essays were first published in the French review ''Revue de Paris''. A book was published in 1924 by the Alcan publishing house. It was reprinted in 1959 by the [[Presses Universitaires de France]], on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Bergson.

In a [[foreword]] published in 1900, but suppressed in 1924, Bergson explains that through the three articles, he wanted to study [[laughter]], especially the laughter caused by the comic, and to determine the principal categories of comic situations, to determine the laws of the comic. He also added a list of works and [[Laughter in literature|studies about laughter]] and the comic.

In the [[preface]] written in 1924 to replace the initial foreword, Bergson explains that his method is entirely new because it consists in determining the process of the comic instead of analyzing the effects of the comic. He specifies that his method does not contradict the results of the other one, but he assumes that it is more rigorous from a scientific point of view. He adds a larger bibliography.

== First essay ==
The first essay is made up of three parts:
# ''Du comique en général'' (Of the comic in general)
# ''Le comique des formes et le comique des mouvements'' (The comedy of forms and the comedy of movements)
# ''Force d’expansion du comique'' (The expansive force of the comic)

In a short introduction, Bergson announces that he will try to define the comic, but he does not want to give a rigid definition of the word; he wants to deal with the comic as part of [[Human condition|human life]]. His ambition is also to have a better knowledge of society, of the functioning of human [[imagination]] and of collective imagination, but also of art and life.&lt;ref&gt;«Et peut-être trouverons-nous aussi que nous avons fait, sans le vouloir, une connaissance utile. Raisonnable, à sa façon, jusque dans ses plus grands écarts, méthodique dans sa folie, rêvant, je le veux bien, mais évoquant en rêve des visions qui sont tout de suite acceptées et comprises d’une société entière, comment la fantaisie comique ne nous renseignerait-elle pas sur les procédés de travail de l’imagination humaine, et plus particulièrement de l’imagination sociale, collective, populaire ? Issue de la vie réelle, apparentée à l’art, comment ne nous dirait-elle pas aussi son mot sur l’art et sur la vie ?», Henri Bergson, ''Le Rire''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''General facts on the comic'''

Bergson begins to note three facts on the comic:
* the comic is strictly a human phenomenon. A landscape cannot be a source of laughter, and when humans make fun of animals, it is often because they recognize some human behaviour in them. Man is not only a being that can laugh, but also a being that is a source of laughter.
* laughter requires an indifference, a detachment from sensibility and emotion: it is more difficult to laugh when one is fully aware of the seriousness of a situation.
* it is difficult to laugh alone, it is easier to laugh collectively. One who is excluded from a group of people does not laugh with them; there is often a complicity in laughter. Thus, the comic is not a mere pleasure of the intellect, it is a human and social activity; it has a social meaning.

'''The social role of laughter'''

Bergson now assumes that the comic requires the use of intelligence instead of sensibility, and he tries to determine what is the real role of intelligence in a comic situation. He takes the example of a man falling down in the street in front of passers-by. Laughter is caused by an accidental situation, caused by a movement. The source of the comic is the presence of a rigidity in life. Life is defined by Bergson a perpetual movement, it is characterized by flexibility and agility. Comic situations, such as that of a falling man, are situations where movement is not flexible.

However, the comic is not only based upon unusual situations, but also upon characters and individuals. Bergson takes the example of absent-minded people, a common source of comedy. People tend to associate individuals with a comic character, which increases the comic. In addition, when we make fun of somebody for one of his vices, it is because the individual is unaware of his own vice while we are aware of it. Thus laughter forces people to be better and to suppress their vices, because laughter makes them be conscious of them. This is why Bergson asserts that laughter has a moral role, it is a factor of uniformity of behaviours, it eliminates ludicrous and eccentric attitudes : « Beyond actions and attitudes that are automatically punished by their natural consequences, there remains a certain inflexibility of the body, of the mind and of the character that society would like to eliminate to obtain a greater elasticity and a better sociability of its members. This inflexibility is the comic, laughter is the punishment ».

'''Comic and forms of materiality'''

Laughter can be caused by ugliness, but ugliness is not always comic. To laugh about ugliness, we need to have a naive, immediate, original approach, not to think. We also have to focus on a specific feature of the person and to associate the person with this feature. It is the same with cartoonists, who exaggerate physical and natural features of people. Our imagination sees in everyone the efforts of the soul to dynamise materiality, the soul or the mind give flexibility, agility and animation to the rigid body and to materiality. However the body tends to rigidify itself, and it produces a comic effect: « When materiality succeeds in fixing the movement of the soul, in hindering its grace, it obtains a comic effect. To define comic in comparison to its contrary, we should oppose it to grace instead of beauty. It is stiffness rather than ugliness ».

'''Comic of gesture and movements'''

Bergson concludes as an immediate consequence of the previous chapter that « attitudes, gestures and movements of the human body are subject to laughter precisely in the way that body makes us think to a simple machine ». Humans tend to laugh when they see the effect of a machine within the human body. This is why when we concentrate our attention on a particular gesture made by a speaker to better express his thinking, we automatically find it comic whereas this movement in itself is not comic. We also laugh when someone imitates somebody else, because to imitate somebody, the imitator reproduces the most mechanical, the most unconscious movements and gestures of the person. This is also the case with the parody of an activity. For Bergson, this explains also why, as [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] had noted, when we see two faces that look like very much, we find it comic, while the faces alone are not comic.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsi se résout la petite énigme proposée par Pascal dans un passage des Pensées : « Deux visages semblables, dont aucun ne fait rire en particulier, font rire ensemble par leur ressemblance. » Henri Bergson: ''Le Rire. Essai sur la signification du comique'', [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Rire._Essai_sur_la_signification_du_comique/Chapitre_I._%E2%80%94_IV Chapitre I]&lt;/ref&gt; And finally: « This is because really lively life is not supposed to repeat itself. Where there is repetition, complete similarity, we suspect that there is mechanism behind life. That diversion of life towards mechanism is the real cause of laughter. »

'''The comic and human imagination'''

At the beginning of chapter five, Bergson thinks again about his method of analysis. He recalls that to look for a unique method of the comic does not make sense. However, there is a central cause of the comic, and all comic situations are derived from it. This central cause is mechanism applied to life, and all comic effects are articulated around this cause by our imagination. There are three main directions in which our imagination is oriented to produce comic effects, three general laws:
* a lot of things are comic ''en droit'' ([[de jure]]) whereas they are not comic ''en fait'' (de facto), because common use and collective habits generalize these comic situations. Hence the mind needs to break with fashion to revive and to note the comedy of the situation, not to create it, Bergson insists. He takes the example of clothes: fashionable clothes do not make us laugh, because we are used to seeing them, while we automatically make fun of someone who wears old-fashioned clothes. Also the application of social conventions and rules are comic situation because these regulations and applied automatically, mechanically. « A mechanism inserted into nature, an automatic regulation of society, these are the two kinds of funny effects at which we are ending up. »
* contrary to the body, the soul is perfectly flexible, always in activity. However, we tend to attribute these qualities to the body, we considerer it as flexible and ignore his resistance, its materiality. But when we are fully aware that the body is a weigh, a burden for the soul, the situation is comic.&lt;ref&gt;Mais supposons qu’on appelle notre attention sur cette matérialité du corps. Supposons qu’au lieu de participer de la légèreté du principe qui l’anime, le corps ne soit plus à nos yeux qu’une enveloppe lourde et embarrassante, lest importun qui retient à terre une âme impatiente de quitter le sol. Alors le corps deviendra pour l’âme ce que le vêtement était tout à l’heure pour le corps lui-même, une matière inerte posée sur une énergie vivante. Et l’impression du comique se produira dès que nous aurons le sentiment net de cette superposition. Nous l’aurons surtout quand on nous montrera l’âme taquinée par les besoins du corps, — d’un côté la personnalité morale avec son énergie intelligemment variée, de l’autre le corps stupidement monotone, intervenant et interrompant avec son obstination de machine. Plus ces exigences du corps seront mesquines et uniformément répétées, plus l’effet sera saisissant. Bergson, ''[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Rire._Essai_sur_la_signification_du_comique/Chapitre_I._%E2%80%94_V Le Rire]'', Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, « is comic any incident which attracts our attention on the physique of a person while the mind is active ». There is a comic effect when our attention is diverted from the mind to the physique.
* we laugh every time somebody looks like a material thing, every time we are under the impression that someone is a thing.

[[Image:Programming light board.jpg|thumb|right|The light board operator programs the light board along with the lighting designer]]
The '''light board operator''' (commonly referred to as the "Light Op" or "Board Op") or moving light programmer, is the [[Electrician (theatre)|electrician]] who operates and/or programs the [[light board]]. Depending on the scale and type of production, the board op may be responsible for [[Stage lighting instrument|conventional]] or [[Intelligent lighting|automated]] lighting fixtures, as well as practicals and, in some instances, controlling video as well.  

Sometimes, most commonly in small productions, the Light board Operator will also be the [[stage manager]]. Another variation in smaller productions has the responsibilities of Light board Operator and [[Sound operator]] combined into one position. In the smallest productions, all three of these functions are done by one person. For productions where lighting and sound are operated by a single person, as well productions where sound needs to be exactly timed with lighting, it is not unusual to use [[MIDI Show Control]] (MSC), [[Open Sound Control]] (OSC), or Timecode ([[SMPTE_time_code|SMPTE Time Code]]) to synchronize the lighting, video, and audio consoles.

The light board operator may, in some cases, also be the [[lighting designer]] for a production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmproductionroles11med23.wikispaces.com/Lighting filmproductionroles.com Lighting]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==

The light op has many responsibilities in theater, especially in small productions.  For small productions, the light op may also be the [[lighting designer]] and [[master electrician]], and is therefore required to create a lighting plot, and perform a complete hang and focus in addition to their duties as board operator. In more professional environments, the light board operator is a highly specialized professional who is usually well versed in the intricacies of a wide variety of lighting instruments and control consoles, and able to easily program complex lighting cues involving multiple [[Light fixture|fixtures]] and other components. &lt;ref&gt;[http://getinmedia.com/careers/lighting-console-operator getinmedia.com careers lighting console operator] &lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[technical rehearsal]]s, the light board operator usually programs the lighting console with the assistance of the [[lighting designer]] and [[stage manager]]. In situations where manual boards are being used, the light board operator will work with the lighting designer and the stage manager to practice the timing of the lighting changes.

During the performance, the light board operator is often on headset with the Deputy Stage Manager, and multiple other members of the [[running crew]]. Their responsibility lies primarily in advancing the cues under the direction of the deputy stage manager. It is important that light board operators be familiar with the [[light plot]], as they may be called upon to make "on the fly" changes to accommodate unexpected circumstances that occur during the production.

'''''Measuring the Universe''''' is a [[performance art]] work by [[Slovaks|Slovak]] artist [[Roman Ondak]] first installed in the [[Pinakothek der Moderne]] in [[Munich]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Measuring the Universe|last = Ondák|first = Roman|publisher = JRP{{!}}Ringier|year = 2009|isbn = 978-3-03764-024-1|location = Unknown|pages = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition stars as a blank white wall and begins to fill when museum guards mark visitors' height along with their name and the current date. It is in the collection of [[Tate Modern]] in [[London]], [[Pinakothek der Moderne|Pinakother der Moderne]] in [[Munich]] and [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMa]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/tateshots-roman-ondak-measuring-universe|title = TateShots: Roman Ondak, Measuring the Universe|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
The only items required for the installation were a white room and a few black markers. What began as  a clean white space has been filled with letters and lines and numbers as people pass through the gallery. Each tiny line represents a different person. The thousands and thousands of lines show just how many people pass through the museum each day, how many people were, affected by this installation.

The '''Kyiv Opera''' group was formally established in the summer of 1867, and is the third oldest in Ukraine, after [[Odessa Opera]] and [[Lviv Opera]]. Today, the Kyiv Opera Company performs at the National Opera House of Ukraine named after [[Taras Shevchenko]] in [[Kyiv]].

==History==

===Early History: 1867 - 20th century===
Established in the summer of 1867 by [[Ferdinand Berger]] (? - 1875). Berger succeeded in inviting many talented singers, musicians, and conductors, and the city council (duma) had offered the newly created trouppe to use the City Theatre (constructed in 1856, architect I. Shtrom) for their performances. Officially, the theatre was named the City Theatre but was most commonly referred to as the Russian Opera. The day of the first performance, November 8 (October 27 old style), 1867 was made a city holiday. The performance of the opera ''[[Askold's Tomb]]'' by [[Alexey Verstovsky]] was the troupe's debut. The initial success is attributed to the vocal talents of that time of O. Satagano-Gorchakova, F. L'vov, M. Agramov but also to the captivating plot taken from some principal pages of the ancient history of the city.

Early performances were mostly Russian operas, including ''Ruslan and Ludmila'' by [[Mikhail Glinka]], ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]'' by [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]], ''Maccabees'' by [[Anton Rubinstein]] and ''The Power of the Fiend'' by [[Alexander Serov|A. Serov]], as well as translated European operas including ''The Barber of Seville'' by [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]], ''The Marriage of Figaro'' by [[Mozart]], ''Der Freischütz'' by [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' by [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], and operas by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], which became the favorite of the Kievites.

On February 4, 1896, after a morning performance of ''Eugene Onegin'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], a fire erupted from an unextinguished candle in the theatre. The fire consumed the whole building within several hours. One of the largest musical libraries in Europe along with numerous costumes and stage props of many performances were lost during the fire. After the fire of the City Theatre, the troupe performed on other stages for several years, including Bergonie's Theatre (now the National Theatre of Russian Drama named after [[Lesya Ukrainka]]), Solovtsov's Theatre (now the National Theatre named after [[Ivan Franko]]) and even on the arena of the famous Krutikov's Circus.

===Early 20th century===
After the fire, the City Council had announced the international competition to design a new building for the Opera Theatre in Kyiv. The winning proposal was by [[Victor Schröter]]. The exterior was designed in Neo-Renaissance style and had accounted for the needs of the actors and the spectators. The interior was redesigned in a classical style and called ''Viennese Modern''. However, his greatest achievement is considered to be the stage - one of the largest in Europe designed to the latest engineering standards.

[[File:500 000 karbovanets 1994 back.jpg|thumb|Opera depicted on Ukraine's [[Karbovanets#Third karbovanets|interim bank note]] in 1990s.]]

On {{OldStyleDate|September 29|1901|September 16}}, the solemn opening of the new premise of the theatre took place with a performance of cantata Kyiv by composer Wilhelm Hartweld (1859 - 1927) and a presentation of the opera ''Life for the Tsar'' by M. Glinka.

On {{OldStyleDate|14 September|1911|1 September}}, there was a performance of [[Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s [[The Tale of Tsar Saltan (Rimsky-Korsakov)|''The Tale of Tsar Saltan'']] at the [[Kiev Opera House]] in the presence of the Tsar and his two oldest daughters, the Grand Duchesses [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|Olga]] and [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Tatiana]]. The theater was occupied by 90 men posted as interior guards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexanderpalace.org/palace/stolypin-murder-1911-kiev.html]&lt;/ref&gt; During the intermission of a performance [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] [[Pyotr Stolypin]] was killed.
According to [[Alexander Spiridovich]], after the second act "Stolypin was standing in front of the ramp separating the parterre from the orchestra, his back to the stage. On his right were [[Vladimir Freedericksz|Baron Freedericks]] and [[Vladimir Sukhomlinov|Gen. Suhkomlinov]]." His personal body guard had gone to smoke. Stolypin was shot twice, once in the arm and once in the chest by [[Dmitry Bogrov]], a leftist revolutionary, trying to [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitate]] himself. Bogrov ran to one of the entries and was subsequently caught. &lt;!--Stolypin was reported to have coolly risen from his chair, removed his gloves and unbuttoned his jacket, exposing a blood-soaked waistcoat.&lt;ref&gt;O. Figes (1996) A People's Tragedy. The Russian Revolution 1891-1924, p. 22?&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; "He [Stolypin] turned toward the Imperial Box, then seeing the Tsar who had entered the box, he made a gesture with both hands to tell the Tsar to go back." The orchestra began to play "God Save the Tsar." The doctors hoped Stolypin would recover, but, despite never losing consciousness, his condition deteriorated. The next day&lt;!--after the shooting, or after his death?--&gt;, the distressed Tsar knelt at Stolypin's hospital bedside and kept repeating the words "Forgive me". Stolypin died three days later.

In the first decade of the 20th century, the Kyiv Opera Theatre attracted the most outstanding Ukrainian and Russian singers, including O. Petlyash, P. Tsecevich, K. Voronets, M. Medvedev, K. Brun, O. Mosin and O. Kamionsky and famous opera stars from the West often came on tours. Several unusual for the time performances took place on the stage: ''Die Walkure'' by [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], ''Sadko'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] and ''Mefistofele'' by [[Arrigo Boito]].

As Kyiv began to grow and with the conclusion of [[World War I]], the Kyiv Opera occupied a special place in the [[USSR]] and the world. The Kyiv Opera Theatre was considered to be one of the most prestigious in Ukraine and Russia. [[Kurt Adler]] was First Conductor from 1933-1935.

A '''national myth''' is an inspiring [[narrative]] or [[anecdote]] about a [[nation]]'s past. Such [[Mythology|myths]] often serve as an important [[national symbol]] and affirm a set of national [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. A national myth may sometimes take the form of a [[national epic]] or be incorporated into a [[civil religion]].  A group of related myths about a nation may be referred to as the '''national mythos''' from μῦθος the [[wikt:mythos|original Greek word for "myth"]].

A national myth is a legend or fictionalized narrative which has been elevated to a serious [[mythology|mythological]], symbolic, and esteemed level so as to be true to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Ernest Renan |last=Renan |first=Ernest |year=1882 |title=[[:s:fr:Qu’est-ce qu’une nation ?|Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might simply over-dramatize true incidents, omit important historical details, or add details for which there is no evidence; or it might simply be a fictional story that no one takes to be true literally,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Abizadeh |first=Arash |year=2004 |title=Historical Truth, National Myths, and Liberal Democracy |journal=Journal of Political Philosophy |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=291–313 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9760.2004.00201.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; but contains a symbolic meaning for the nation.  The national folklore of many nations includes a [[founding myth]], which may involve a struggle against [[colonialism]] or a [[war of independence (disambiguation)|war of independence]].  In many cases, the meaning of the national myth is disputed among different parts of the population.

In some places, the national myth may be [[spirituality|spiritual]] in tone and refer to stories of the nation's founding at the hands of a [[God]], several [[gods]], leaders favored by gods, and other supernatural beings.

National myths serve many social and political purposes. National myths often exist only for the purpose of state-sponsored [[propaganda]]. In [[totalitarian]] [[dictatorship]]s, the leader might be given, for example, a mythical supernatural life history in order to make him or her seem god-like and supra-powerful (see also [[cult of personality]]). However, national myths exist in every society. In [[Liberalism|liberal]] regimes they can serve the purpose of inspiring civic virtue and self-sacrifice (Miller 1995), or of consolidating the power of dominant groups and legitimizing their rule.

== Background ==

National myths have been created and propagated by national [[intellectuals]], who have used them as instruments of political mobilization on demographic bases such as [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Safty  |first=Adel |authorlink= |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Leadership and Conflict Resolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAMntG01-lwC&amp;pg=PA273 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear= |year=2002 |publisher= Universal publishers |location= USA |language= |isbn=1-58112-617-4 |oclc= |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page=273 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= Shnirelman (1995) considers nationalist myths ... created by national intellectuals and propagated by the intelligentsia with the aim of using this myths as an instrument of ethno-political mobilization under interethnic conflicts. |laysummary= |laydate=|postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social background ===

The concept of [[national identity]] is inescapably connected with myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cameron  |first=Keith  |authorlink= |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=National identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aL2VArrJnzcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22nationalistic+myths%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=i0dhTsHoOcbY4QTfgbVQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nationalistic%20myths%22&amp;f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear= |year=1999 |publisher= Intellect|location=Exeter, England |language= |isbn=978-1-871516-05-0 |oclc=40798482 |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page=4 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= Myth is inextricably linked with the concept of national identity |laysummary= |laydate=|postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex of myths is at the core of every ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=J.

All modern national identities were preceded by nationalist movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Østergaard|first=Uffe|title=Classical and modern social theory|year=2000|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass.|isbn=978-0-631-21288-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PeGtsC2Hp4C&amp;pg=PA448&amp;dq=nationalist+myths+first+emerged+%22national+movements%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VG9oTvuLEYWe-QbzkcjiCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=nationalist%20myths%20first%20emerged%20%22national%20movements%22&amp;f=false|author2=Heine Andersen |author3=Lars Bo Kaspersen |accessdate=8 September 2011|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "nation" was used in the [[Middle Ages]], it had totally different meaning than in the age of nationalism, where it was linked to the efforts aimed to creation of the [[nation-state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Østergaard|first=Uffe|title=Classical and modern social theory|year=2000|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass.|isbn=978-0-631-21288-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PeGtsC2Hp4C&amp;pg=PA448&amp;dq=nationalist+myths+first+emerged+%22national+movements%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VG9oTvuLEYWe-QbzkcjiCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=nationalist%20myths%20first%20emerged%20%22national%20movements%22&amp;f=false|author2=Heine Andersen |author3=Lars Bo Kaspersen |accessdate=8 September 2011|quote= We can, for example, certainly encounter term "nation" in the Middle Ages, but the word meant something completely different than in the age of nationalism, where it is inextricably linked with the efforts to create an associated state.|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological background ===

Besides their social background, nationalist myths have also a [[Psychology|psychological]] explanation which is connected with nationalist myth of stable [[homeland]] community. The [[complexity]] of relations with the modern external world and incoherence of the inner psychological world can result with anxiety which is reduced by static self-labelling and self-construction and gaining an imaginary emotion of stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Brown  |first=David |authorlink= |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Contemporary nationalism: civic, ethnocultural, and multicultural politics |url=  |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear= |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London ; New York |language= |isbn=0-203-38025-8 |oclc= 43286590 |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page=24 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= Contemporary nationalism |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=uUPt5HiudwAC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=%22nationalist+myth+is%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Qw1iTqOBPK3a4QTZitWPCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nationalist%20myth%20is%22&amp;f=false|quote= |laysummary= |laydate=|postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of nationalism's primary myths are connected with beliefs in:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Brown  |first=David  |authorlink= |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Contemporary nationalism: civic, ethnocultural, and multicultural politics |url=  |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear= |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London ; New York |language= |isbn=0-203-38025-8 |oclc= 43286590 |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |pages=23, 24 |nopp= |at= |chapter= Contemporary nationalism |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=uUPt5HiudwAC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=%22nationalist+myth+is%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Qw1iTqOBPK3a4QTZitWPCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nationalist%20myth%20is%22&amp;f=false|quote= |laysummary= |laydate=|postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''community's permanence'' (the myth of the eternal nation), based on its national character, territory and institutions and on its continuity across many generations, and
# ''community's common ancestry'' (myth of the common ancestry).

The nationalist myths portray the [[nation]] as sleeping and waiting to be awakened, but scholarly discourse avoids such images because [[national identity]] either exists or not and can not be asleep and awakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Danforth|first=Loring|title=The Macedonian conflict : ethnic nationalism in a transnational world|year=1995|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|accessdate=8 September 2011|page=15|quote=.. nationalist myths of nation waiting, Sleeping Beauty like, to be awakened....In scholarly discourse this image should be avoided .. national identity is a matter of self-ascription, it either exists or it does not, it can not be asleep and then be awakened...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==

Nationalist [[myths]] sometimes have a tendency to stimulate conflicts between nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edward Brown|first=Michael|title=Nationalism and ethnic conflict|publisher=MIT Press|accessdate=3 September 2011|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=67|ISBN=978-0-585-35807-9|year=1997|quote=... we do argue that tendency to breed conflicts is inherent to typical nationalist myths}}&lt;/ref&gt; to magnify distinctive characteristics of the national group and to overstate the threat to the nation posed by other groups propagating militant fulfilment of their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schnabel|first=Albrecht|title=Conflict prevention from rhetoric to reality: Organizations and institutions|year=2004|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Md|isbn=978-0-7391-0738-6|author2=David Carment|quote= overemphasize the cultural and historical distinctiveness of the national group [and its territory], exaggerate the threat posed to the nation by other groups, ignore the degree to which the nation's  own actions provoked such treats, and play down the cost of seeking national goals through militant means.| pages=45, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10128">The '''Noma Concours for Picture Book Illustrations''' (Japanese: 野間国際絵本原画コンクール) was organised by Asia/Pacific Cultural Centre for [[UNESCO]] (ACCU) supported by the Noma International Book Development Fund from 1978 to 2008. It was an annual competition, ending in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accu.or.jp/noma/english/e_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize was named after [[Shoichi Noma]], the fourth president of the Japanese family-run publishing house [[Kodansha]] Ltd. At the 1963 [[Frankfurt Book Fair]], he gave a speech entitled "Cultural Exchange in Publishing", in which he said “In order to advance and sustain world peace, it is most important to develop international mutual understanding by means of cross-cultural interchange through publishing.”  In this spirit, several Noma Awards were set up: the [[Noma Award for Publishing in Africa]], established in  1980; the [[Noma Literary Prize]],  also established in 1980; and the [[Noma Award for the Translation of Japanese Literature]], established in 1980 to commemorate Kodansha’s 80th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;Toyo Yoshizaki, “Books are Silent Ambassadors: The Noma Award for the Translation of Japanese Literature”, Publishing Research Quarterly, Winter 2004, pp.31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the competition was to discover up-and-coming illustrators, graphic designers and artists in Asia (except Japan), the Pacific, Africa, Arab States, and Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, and to provide an opportunity at which they could present their works to offer incentives for their creative activities. Prizewinning works were displayed in exhibitions such as the [[International Library of Children's Literature]]&lt;ref&gt;Where Children Meet Books: International Library of Children's Literature, Tokyo Murayama, Takao. Bookbird 45.3 (2007): 39-45.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ueno]], Tokyo, and the [[Biennial of Illustration Bratislava]] in [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.papertigers.org/resources/International/NomaConcours.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Octopussy and The Living Daylights''''' (sometimes published as '''''Octopussy''''') is the fourteenth and final [[James Bond]] book written by [[Ian Fleming]] in the [[James Bond novels|Bond series]]. The book is a collection of short stories published [[Posthumous work|posthumously]] in the United Kingdom by [[Jonathan Cape]] on 23 June 1966.

The book originally contained just two stories, "[[#"Octopussy"|Octopussy]]" and "[[#"The Living Daylights"|The Living Daylights]]", with subsequent editions also carrying firstly "[[#"The Property of a Lady"|The Property of a Lady]]" and then "[[#"007 in New York"|007 in New York]]". The stories were first published in different publications, with "Octopussy" first serialised in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' in October 1965. "The Living Daylights" had first appeared in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' on 4 February 1962; "The Property of a Lady" was commissioned by [[Sotheby's]] for the 1963 edition of their journal, ''The Ivory Hammer''; whilst "007 in New York" first appeared in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' in October 1963.

The two original stories, "Octopussy" and "The Living Daylights", were both adapted for publication in [[comic strip]] format in the ''Daily Express'' in 1966–1967. Elements from the stories have also been used in the [[Eon Productions]] Bond films. The first, ''[[Octopussy]]'', starring [[Roger Moore]] as James Bond, was released in 1983 as the thirteenth film in the series and provided the [[back story]] for the film [[Octopussy (character)|Octopussy's]] family, while "The Property of a Lady" was more closely adapted for an auction sequence in the film. ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', released in 1987, was the fifteenth Bond film produced by Eon and starred [[Timothy Dalton]] in his first appearance as Bond. "007 in New York", meanwhile, provided character and plot elements for the first two films starring [[Daniel Craig]] as Bond, ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' and ''[[Quantum of Solace (film)|Quantum of Solace]]''.

==Plots==

==="Octopussy" {{anchor|Octopussy}}===
[[Secret Intelligence Service|Secret Service]] operative [[James Bond]], code name 007, is assigned to apprehend a hero of the [[World War II|Second World War]] implicated in a murder involving a cache of [[Nazi gold]]. Bond appears only briefly in this story, which is told mostly in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] from the perspective of Major Dexter Smythe, the man Bond has been sent to bring in. Smythe remained in [[Kitzbühel]], Austria, after the war, found the gold with the help of a mountain guide, and killed him in order to keep it for himself. Bond was put on the case after the guide's body fell out of a glacier and he recognized the man as a ski instructor and father figure from his youth. Smythe is now a melancholy alcoholic living alone on the beach, interacting mainly with the residents of its coral reef – including the titular Octopussy, a beloved 'pet' [[octopus]] that Smythe feeds and talks to.

Bond chooses not to take Smythe into custody immediately, but leaves him to contemplate his options – suicide or a [[court martial]]. As Smythe hunts for [[Scorpaenidae|scorpion fish]] to feed Octopussy, he suffers a sting which triggers a fatal heart attack, during which Octopussy pulls him under. Deciding to spare Smythe's reputation, Bond classifies the death as an accidental drowning.

==="The Living Daylights" {{anchor|The Living Daylights}}===
An unusually morose James Bond is assigned sniper duty to help British agent 272 escape from [[East Berlin]]. Bond's duty is to safeguard his crossing into [[West Berlin]] by eliminating a top [[KGB]] [[Assassination|assassin]] codenamed "Trigger" who has been dispatched to kill him. Bond takes up a position on the western edge of the border, in a hotel overlooking the [[no man's land]] of broken, brightly lit ground that 272 will have to cross. On each of three nights, he sees a female orchestra arrive for rehearsal and leave, taking particular notice of a beautiful blonde cellist. Once 272 starts to cross the border, Bond sees Trigger get in position to kill him and realizes that it is the cellist. He adjusts his aim at the last moment and shoots her rifle instead of killing her, allowing 272 to reach safety.

Afterward, Bond admits to his spotter that he did not try for a kill shot only because Trigger had been a woman. He muses that even though 272 is safe, the mission will be considered a failure because he did not kill Trigger, and he hopes that [[M (James Bond)|M]] will fire him for it.

==="The Property of a Lady" {{anchor|The Property of a Lady}}===
The Secret Service learns that Maria Freudenstein, an employee known to be a double agent working for the Soviet Union, has just received a valuable item of jewelry crafted by [[Peter Carl Fabergé]] and is planning to auction it at [[Sotheby's]]. Bond suspects that the Resident Director of the KGB in London will attend the auction and underbid for the item, in order to drive the price up to the value needed to pay Maria for her services. Bond attends the auction, spots the man, and leaves to make arrangements for his expulsion from London as ''[[persona non grata]]''.

==="007 in New York" {{anchor|007 in New York}}===
A brief tale in which Bond muses about New York City and his favourite recipe for [[scrambled eggs]], during a quick mission to the titular city to warn a female [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] employee that her new boyfriend is a KGB agent. It is notable for including a rare humorous conclusion and for its mention of Solange, a young lady of Bond's intimate acquaintance who works in a shop, [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch|Abercrombie's]], "appropriately employed in their Indoor Games Department".

==Characters and themes==
The author of the "continuation" Bond stories, [[Raymond Benson]], noted that in "The Living Daylights" Bond's thoughts on killing are examined once again, showing that although 007 did not like doing it, he considered that he must as part of his duty to complete an assignment.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=144}} Once the mission is completed, with Bond deliberately not killing the assassin, there is an attitude of complacency with Bond shrugging off his colleague's complaints about the incident.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=145}} Academic [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] sees the colleague, the officious Captain Spender, as the antithesis of Bond and an echo of Colonel Schreiber, the head of security at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE), who appeared in "[[From a View to a Kill]]".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=41}}

In the act of not killing the assassin, the theme of disobedience is raised in "The Living Daylights",{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=82–84}} with Bond calling what he has to do "murder" and subsequently dismissing his actions by saying "with any luck it will cost me my Double-0 number".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=84}} Raymond Benson considered "Octopussy" to be a morality tale, with greed bringing repercussions years later to the main protagonist, Dexter Smythe.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=143}}

==Background==
On the morning of 12 August 1964, Fleming died of a heart attack;&lt;ref name="Times obit (1965)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Mr. Ian Fleming|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=13 August 1964|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; eight months later, ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' was published.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=75}} The rights to Fleming's works were held by [[Ian Fleming Publications|Glidrose Productions]] (now Ian Fleming Publications) and it was decided by the company that two short stories, "Octopussy" and "The Living Daylights", would be published in 1966.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=445}}

==="Octopussy"===
The story "Octopussy" was written in early 1962 at Fleming's [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in Jamaica.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=78}} The story is told in the manner of "Quantum of Solace", with Bond as catalyst for story told in flashback, rather than as a main character for action.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=240}} The topics chosen for Fleming were familiar ground for him to cover, with hidden gold, tropical fish and the wartime exploits of commandos all coming from elements of his past.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=408}} Also from the past, or from his acquaintance, were other references used in the story and Miscellaneous Objectives Bureau was a fictional version of Fleming's [[No. 30 Commando|30 AU unit]].{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=409}} One of Fleming's neighbours in Jamaica, and later his lover, was Blanche Blackwell, mother of [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records]]. Fleming had previously used Blackwell's name as the guano-collecting ship in ''Dr. No'', calling it ''Blanche''.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=113}} Blackwell had given Fleming a [[coracle]] called ''Octopussy'', the name of which Fleming used for the story.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=93}} ''Octopussy'' was posthumously [[Serial (literature)|serialised]] in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper, 4–8 October 1965.{{sfn|Gilbert|2012|p=443}}

==="The Living Daylights"===
Fleming originally titled "The Living Daylights" as "Trigger Finger",{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} although when it first appeared, in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' colour supplement of 4 February 1962,{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=396}} it was under the title of "Berlin Escape".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=78}} It was also published in the June 1962 issue of the American magazine [[Argosy (magazine)|''Argosy'']] under the same name.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=24}} For ''The Sunday Times'', Fleming had commissioned [[Graham Sutherland]] to undertake the artwork to accompany the piece, at a cost of 100 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]],{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=395}} although the artwork wasn't used in the published edition.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=396}}

As background research to the story, Fleming corresponded with Captain E.K. Le Mesurier, secretary of the [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom|National Rifle Association]] at [[Bisley Camp|Bisley]] for information and to correct some of the more specialist areas of knowledge required for [[sniper]] shooting. Part of the background to the plot, of using the noise of the orchestra to cover the crossing over no man's land, was inspired by [[Pat Reid]]'s escape from [[Oflag IV-C|Colditz]] prisoner of war camp, with two escapers having to run across a courtyard under the cover of the noise from an orchestra.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} The conductor of the Colditz orchestra was [[Douglas Bader]], who played golf with Fleming on a number of occasions.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} The assassin, Trigger, was partly based on [[Amaryllis Fleming]], Ian's half-sister, a concert cellist with blonde hair, and Fleming managed to get a passing reference to her in the story, saying: "Of course Suggia had managed to look elegant, as did that girl Amaryllis somebody."{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}}

==="Property of a Lady"===
"Property of a Lady", which was written in early 1963, was commissioned by [[Sotheby's]] for use in their annual journal, ''The Ivory Hammer'',{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=240}}&lt;ref name="Benson"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Benson|first=Raymond|authorlink=Raymond Benson|title=[[The James Bond Bedside Companion]]|year=1988|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Boxtree Ltd]]|location=London|isbn=978-1-85283-233-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was published in November 1963 and later in ''[[Playboy]]'';{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=25}} Sotheby's chairman [[Peter Wilson (auctioneer)|Peter Wilson]] is mentioned by name in the story. Fleming was so unhappy with the final piece he wrote to Wilson and refused payment for something he considered so lacklustre.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=422}} Nonetheless, it was adapted as the auction sequence in the film ''[[Octopussy]]''.&lt;ref name="Benson" /&gt;

==="007 in New York"===
In 1959 Fleming was commissioned by ''The Sunday Times'' to write a series of articles based on world cities, material for which later was collected into a book entitled ''[[Thrilling Cities]]''; whilst travelling through New York for material, Fleming wrote "007 in New York" from Bond's point of view.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=60}} "007 in New York" was originally titled "Reflections in a Carey Cadillac"{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=240}} and it contains a recipe for scrambled eggs which came from May Maxwell,{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=240}} the housekeeper to friend Ivar Bryce who gave her name to Bond's own housekeeper, May.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=113}} The story was first published in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' in October 1963 as "Agent 007 in New York", but was subsequently renamed as "007 in New York" for the 1964 US editions of ''Thrilling Cities''.{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=381}}

==Release and reception==
''Octopussy and The Living Daylights'' was published in Britain on 23 June 1966{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=31}} by [[Jonathan Cape]] and cost 10s.6d.&lt;ref name="Burgess (1966)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Burgess|first=Anthony|title=New Fiction|newspaper=[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]|date=14 July 1966|authorlink=Anthony Burgess}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardback edition of the book contained only the two stories mentioned in the title, although when the paperbacks editions were published, "The Property of a Lady" was also included.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=31}} Once again artist [[Richard Chopping]] provided the cover art, although his fee rose, to 350 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]].&lt;ref name="Midwinter (2010)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Midwinter|first=Janet|title=The Man with the Golden Grudge|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1263359/The-Man-Golden-Grudge-How-illustrator-Ian-Flemings-novels-felt-conned-vast-royalties.html|accessdate=14 October 2011|newspaper=[[Mail on Sunday]]|date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in US by [[New American Library]] with illustrations from [[Paul Bacon (designer)|Paul Bacon]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=31}} By 2002, "007 in New York" had been added to the book by [[Penguin Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Octopussy &amp; The living daylights / Ian Fleming|url=http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?dscnt=1&amp;elementId=1&amp;recIdxs=1&amp;vl(174399379UI0)=any&amp;frbrVersion=5&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A(BLCONTENT)&amp;tab=local_tab&amp;dstmp=1323028327575&amp;srt=rank&amp;mode=Basic&amp;tb=t&amp;indx=2&amp;renderMode=poppedOut&amp;vl(freeText0)=%22007%20in%20new%20york%22&amp;vid=BLVU1&amp;fn=search&amp;frbg=&amp;displayMode=full&amp;ct=display&amp;dum=true&amp;recIds=BLL01006731954&amp;doc=BLL01006731954&amp;tabs=moreTab&amp;fromLogin=true|work=The British Library Catalogue|publisher=[[The British Library]]|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
[[Philip Larkin]] wrote in ''[[The Spectator]]'' that "I am not surprised that Fleming preferred to write novels. James Bond, unlike Sherlock Holmes, does not fit snugly into the short story length: there is something grandiose and intercontinental about his adventures that require elbow room and such examples of the form as we have tend to be eccentric or muted. These are no exception."{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} The critic for ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' wrote that the book was "slight and predictable, and usual sex and violence yield to a plausible use of ballistics and marine biology".{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} Writing in [[The Listener (magazine)|''The Listener'']], [[Anthony Burgess]] thought that "in their fascinated poring on ''things''...remind us that the stuff of the anti-novel needn't necessarily spring from a thought-out aesthetic",&lt;ref name="Burgess (1966)"/&gt; going on to note that "it is the mastery of the world that gives Fleming his peculiar literary niche".&lt;ref name="Burgess (1966)"/&gt; On a personal note, Burgess added "I admired all the Bond books and I'm sorry there'll be no more. A sad farewell to Fleming".&lt;ref name="Burgess (1966)"/&gt;

==Adaptations==
{{main article|James Bond (comic strip)|Octopussy}}

;Comic strip adaptation (1966–1967)
Two of the short stories were adapted for publication in [[comic strip]] format, which were published daily in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper and syndicated worldwide. ''The Living Daylights'' ran from 12 September to 12 November 1966, adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by [[Yaroslav Horak]]; the same pair also worked on ''Octopussy'', which ran from 14 November 1966 to 27 May 1967.{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} The story lines for the strips were altered from the original Fleming version to ensure that they contained a glamorous reason for being Bond involved and to include Bond in action.{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=4}} The strips were reprinted by [[Titan Books]] in 1988{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} and then again in ''The James Bond Omnibus Vol. 2'', published in 2011.{{sfn|McLusky|Gammidge|Hern|Fleming|2011|p=6}}

;''Octopussy'' (1983)
In 1983 [[Eon Productions]] loosely adapted elements of two of the stories, "Octopussy" and "The Property of a Lady" for the [[Octopussy|thirteenth]] film in their [[James Bond in film|Bond series]], starring [[Roger Moore]] as Bond.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=151}} "Octopussy" provided the title of the film and the background for the character [[Octopussy (character)|Octopussy]], the daughter of a character Bond had allowed to commit suicide, rather than face the shame of arrest and imprisonment.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=146}} The film also used the plot device of auctioning of a [[Fabergé egg]] at Sotheby's from "The Property of a Lady" and, as with the story, the auction item was described as being the same "property of a lady".{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=146}}

;''The Living Daylights'' (1987)
In 1987 Eon used the plot of "The Living Daylights", almost unchanged, for a section of their 1987 [[The Living Daylights|film of the same name]].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=168}} The film starred [[Timothy Dalton]] in his first role as Bond, whilst the character of Trigger became that of cello player [[Kara Milovy]].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=173}}

;''Casino Royale'' (2006)
In 2006 Eon used the plot of Fleming's first novel, ''Casino Royale'', for its 21st film of the same name.  However, a main character was named Solange, after the woman featured in "007 in New York."

;''Quantum of Solace'' (2008)
In 2008 Eon used the basic premise from the short story "007 in New York" as part of the film ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', in which Bond warns a female intelligence employee that her boyfriend is an enemy agent.

;''Spectre'' (2015)
In ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', Hans Oberhauser, a background character in "Octopussy" is revealed to be the father of [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] and a former caretaker of Bond in his youth. In the film it is strongly hinted that Blofeld killed Oberhauser because he felt that Oberhauser loved Bond more than him, his own son.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The '''Ontario Handweavers &amp; Spinners''' (OHS) is a non-profit organization based in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] that helps individuals interested in the fiber crafts to communicate and develop their skills, including [[weaving]], [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[Dye|dying]], [[Basket weaving|basket makers]], [[braid]]ers, tablet weavers and paper makers. The OHS communicates to its members through a quarterly [[newsletter]], ''Fibre Focus'', provides [[educational]] programs in spinning and weaving, provides [[scholarships]] and organizes several seminars or conferences each year.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.ohs.on.ca/ "Ontario Handweavers &amp; Spinners website"] OHS. Retrieved 28 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
On 8-9 April 1955 a meeting of 135 members of Ontario weaving guilds was held at the [[Heliconian Club]]. The noted New York weaver [[Berta Frey]] gave a talk and demonstrated putting on a multicolored warp. The group formed an advisory committee to look into setting up a provincial organization, leading to the foundation of the Ontario Handweavers and Spinners the next year.&lt;ref name=Norris1979&gt;{{Citation | last = Norris | first =  Compiled by J.A. | year = 1979|page=4ff

At the time there was increasing interest in reviving traditional [[craft]] skills.&lt;ref name=Alfoldy2005&gt;{{Citation  | last = Alfoldy | first =  Sandra | year = 2005 | title = Crafting Identity : the development of professional fine craft in Canada (p51) | isbn = 978-0-7735-2860-4 | publisher = McGill-Queen's University Press | location = Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1986 the [[Handweavers Guild of America]] held ''Convergence '86'' in Toronto, Canada, its first biennial meeting outside the U.S. 
The conference was co-hosted by the [[Ontario Crafts Council]] and the Ontario Handweavers &amp; Spinners.
About 2,000 weavers and spinners attended the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=xvii |last=Crawford|first=Gail|title=A Fine Line: Studio Crafts in Ontario from 1930 to the Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4l6V1PBHhyUC&amp;pg=PA216|accessdate=2014-08-07|year=1998|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-55002-303-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1998 the organization had grown to over 1,000 members, in over 70 [[guilds]] within six autonomous regions in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Crawford | first =  Gail | year = 1998
 | title = A fine line : studio crafts in Ontario from 1930 to the present | isbn = 978-1-55002-303-9 | publisher = Dundurn Press | location = Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OHS is affiliated with the Ontario Crafts Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craft.on.ca/About_Craft/Organizations "OCC Affiliate Organizations"] Ontario Crafts Council. Retrieved 28 January 2009,&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals prominent in the [[fiber arts]] have graduated from OHS courses or have been associated with the OHS over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Helen Bradfield | first1 = Joan Pringle | last2 = Brian J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2493">A '''print-disabled person''' is "a person who cannot effectively read print because of a visual, physical, perceptual, developmental, cognitive, or learning disability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The definition of "print disabled"?|url=http://www.readingrights.org/definition-print-disabled|publisher=Reading Rights Coalition|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A print disability prevents a person from gaining information from printed material in the standard way, and requires them to utilize alternative methods to access that information. Print disabilities include [[visual impairment]]s, [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], or [[physical disability|physical disabilities]] that impede the ability to manipulate a book in some way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a print disability?|url=https://www.learningally.org/support-topic/what-is-a-print-disability/|publisher=Learning Ally|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by George Kerscher, a pioneer in digital talking books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deborah Kendrick|title=George Kerscher: A Pioneer in Digital Talking Books Still Forging Ahead|url=http://www.afb.org/afbpress/pub.asp?DocID=aw020304&amp;Mode=Print|publisher=AFB AccessWorld Magazine|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A conference organised by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]], in June 2013 adopted a special treaty called "A Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities" (briefly [[Marrakesh VIP Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diplomatic Conference to Conclude a Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/vip_dc/vip_dc_8_rev.pdf|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diplomatic Conference to Conclude a Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities|url=http://www.wipo.int/dc2013/en/|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Marrakesh Treaty represents an important change in how law makers balance the demands of copyright owners against the interests of people with disabilities in particular, and a potential point of inflection in global copyright politics more generally.

{{Nihongo|'''Dr. Ichirō Irabu'''|伊良部 一郎|Irabu Ichirō}} is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[psychiatrist]] in a series of [[Short story|short stories]] by [[Japanese literature|Japanese]] writer Hideo Okuda, originally published primarily in the [[literary magazine]] ''All Yomimono'' from August 2000 to January 2006 and later collected in three ''[[tankōbon]]'': {{Nihongo|'''''In the Pool'''''|イン・ザ・プール|In Za Pūru}}, {{Nihongo3|"[[Flying Trapeze]]"|空中ブランコ|'''Kūchū Buranko'''}} and {{Nihongo3|"Mayoral Election"|町長選挙|'''Chōchō Senkyo'''}}. Of these, ''Kūchū Buranko'' is particularly acclaimed, having won Okuda the 131st [[Naoki Prize]] (given for a book published in the first half of 2004) but, as of January 2011, only ''In the Pool'' has been published in English. Works in other media based on the stories include a [[#Film|feature film]], [[#Television drama|television drama]], [[#Play|stage play]] and [[#Anime|anime series]].

==Premise==
{{Nihongo|Ichiro Irabu|伊良部 一郎}} is a psychiatrist from the Irabu General Hospital. He is fat and pale skinned, with a fetish for administering injections to patients. An unreasonable and rather immature person, he normally ignores Yamashita's plights while challenging him to mid-air trapeze flying due to his self-proclaimed "light-weightedness." During his student days, he frequently misunderstood his lectures. Treated as a general nuisance at the School of Medicine, he entered [[pediatrics]] soon after graduation. However, due to claims of his tantrums and quarrels with child patients, he switched to psychiatry instead. Doubts remain about his actual grades.

==Stories and characters==

===''Kūchū Buranko''===

; {{Nihongo3|"Flying Trapeze"|空中ブランコ|"Kūchū Buranko"|January, 2003 ''All Yomimono''}}
: {{Nihongo|Kōhei Yamashita|山下 公平|Yamashita Kōhei}} is a member of [[circus]] troupe of seven years and is the leader of a flying trapeze team. Both his parents are fellow members. After suffering repeated failures on the trapeze act, he visits a psychiatrist on his wife's and fellow members' advice. Due to his failure during an act, he believes his partner is harassing him. He has been played by [[Masato Sakai]] in the television drama, Kenji Sakamoto in the stage play and [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] in the animated series.
; {{nihongo3|"[[Hedgehog]]"|ハリネズミ|"Harinezumi"|July, 2003 ''All Yomimono''}}
: {{nihongo|Seiji Ino|猪野 誠司|Ino Seiji}} is an [[underboss]] of the [[yakuza]] "Kioi family" from Shibuya. He suffers from such serious [[trypanophobia]] that he cannot use [[chopsticks]] and must instead use a [[spoon]] at meals. He takes a psychiatric test on his common-law wife's advice.
; {{nihongo|''Gifu no Zura''|義父のヅラ||"The wig of the father-in-law"}} (the first publishing "All Yomimono", October, 2003 issue,

His father of law is the Dean of the School of Medicine, which supposedly could aid in his future employment prospects. A classmate of Irabu's during their college days. He has a type of obsessive-compulsive neurosis that compels him to force any place of tidiness into disarray. This disorder is so strong, that with just one glance at it, Ikeyama becomes agonized with the impulse of wanting to strip off his father-in-law's wig. Originally published in the ''All Yomimono'' with the title {{nihongo|''Kyōju no Zura''|教授のヅラ||"The wig of the professor"}}.
; {{nihongo|''Hot Corner''|ホットコーナー||"[[Third base]]"}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Wasei-eigo|Japanese English]]&lt;/ref&gt; (the first publishing "All Yomimono", April, 2003 issue)

===Anime===
{{main|List of Welcome to Irabu's Office episodes}}
{{Nihongo|''Welcome to Irabu's Office''|空中ブランコ|Kūchū Buranko}} is a 2009 [[anime]] of 11 episodes based on the ''Psychiatrist Irabu'' series of short stories, produced at [[Toei Animation]] under the series direction of [[Kenji Nakamura]] for [[Fuji Television]]'s [[noitamina]] [[programming block]]. Though ostensibly an animated series, its visuals are more specifically an experimental mélange of [[traditional animation]] with [[Rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] or otherwise processed [[Live action|live-action]] footage and other imagery.&lt;ref name="bay" /&gt; Manabu Ishikawa's series composition adapts the stories to be set in [[Tokyo|Tōkyō]] during about one week from December 17 to [[Christmas]] (corresponding with the original broadcast, which concluded on [[Christmas Eve]]) and for the chief characters of each story to appear also as supporting players in each other's.

The plot of each episode follows a common thread. Irabu is consulted by a patient suffering from a psychological problem or a problem where other medical approaches have been exhausted. Each of the patients' heads are morphed into an animal head in some scenes after Mayumi administers the vitamin shot to them. Each patient somehow ties into one another, for example the first patient meets with the second patient and the seventh patient, all in the first episode.

The series won the [[Pulcinella]] award for Best Television Series in the "Young Adults" (14–17 years) division at the 2010 Cartoons on the bay international animation festival in the [[province of Genoa]], [[Italy]], the [[Gary Goldman]]-presided jury of that year commending it as a "unique representation of the complex inner world of adolescents.".&lt;ref name="bay" /&gt; Noted animation [[blog]]ger Benjamin Ettinger found it to be lacking in interest in the animation itself and the extreme eclecticism of the visual design no substitute for the finely crafted world of Nakamura and character designer and chief [[animation director]] Takashi Hashimoto's earlier ''[[Bakeneko (anime)]]'' and ''[[Mononoke (TV series)|Mononoke]]'' but still highly enjoyable thanks to the excellence on the part of Nakamura and the episode directors with which the material has been handled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ettinger|first=Benjamin|title=Charles Huettner short film yay|url=http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php?title=huettner&amp;c=1|work=AniPages Daily|accessdate=15 January 2011|date=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlighted the incorporation of real-life [[gravure idol]] [[Yumi Sugimoto]] as Mayumi as a welcome subversion of ''[[moe (slang)|moe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ettinger|first=Benjamin|title=Recent viewing|url=http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php?title=recent_viewing_3&amp;c=1|work=AniPages Daily|accessdate=15 January 2011|date=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Middle Irabu" is slimmer, wearing his normal attire. In this form he has long blond hair, red glasses, and a pair of green bear ears. His personality in this form is notably effeminate. His final form is "little Irabu" (him as a boy), with an over sized lab coat, and shorts instead of trousers. He is quite mellow in this form, but can get ecstatic.

'''''Richard Cardinal: Cry from a Diary of a Métis Child''''' is a 1986 [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentary film by [[Alanis Obomsawin]], about the suicide of [[Métis]] youth Richard Stanley Cardinal, who killed himself in 1984 at the age of 17. Cardinal, who had been placed in 28 different homes during his 14 years in [[Alberta]]'s child welfare system, hanged himself from a cross bar he had nailed between two trees near his last foster home, northwest of [[Edmonton]].&lt;ref name=Henton&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Thirty+years+later+little+done+address+suicide+rate+among+aboriginal+teens+care/9212389/story.html|title=Thirty years later, little done to address suicide rate among aboriginal teens in care|last=Henton|first=Darcy|date=8 January 2014|work=Calgary Herald|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The film makes use of Cardinal's remembrances from his diary, and helped to change public perceptions in Canada around the treatment of children in the foster care system.&lt;ref name=berlinale&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2013/02_programm_2013/02_Filmdatenblatt_2013_20130655.php#tab=filmStills|title=Richard Cardinal: Cry from a Diary of a Métis Child|work=2013 Archives|publisher=[[Berlin International Film Festival]]|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal was born in [[Fort Chipewyan]]. Because of alcoholism in his family, the children were separated from their parents. The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] moved the children to [[Fort McMurray]] where they were given different foster parents, with Richard and his older brother Charlie housed together for the first while—where a litany of physical and mental abuse began.&lt;ref name="Auger"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ammsa.com/publications/windspeaker/nfb-films-reveal-sad-tales-foster-children|title=NFB films reveal sad tales of foster children|last=Auger|first=Josie|volume=7 |issue=22 |date=1990|work=Windspeaker|publisher=[[Aboriginal Multi-Media Society]]|page=10|accessdate=21 September 2014|location=Edmonton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obomsawin offers Cardinal's life story as an expression of the plight of "15,000 native children [who] are wards of the provinces." Cardinal recollections of abuse at his first foster home placement at age six, when he and his older brother were whipped with their pants down in front of the three daughters of his foster family. It quotes Cardinal's brother as stating, "What Richard needed most was to go home. His funeral was the best social service that was provided for Richard, because it finally brought his family together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. Low|first=Brian|title=NFB Kids: Portrayals of Children by the National Film Board of Canada, 1939-1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VdOhE8nISuMC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=%22Richard+Cardinal:+Cry+from+a+Diary+of+a+M%C3%A9tis+Child%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sDcfVLmoE8WWyASUrYCoBQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Richard%20Cardinal%3A%20Cry%20from%20a%20Diary%20of%20a%20M%C3%A9tis%20Child%22&amp;f=false|date=22 February 2002|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|isbn=0889203865|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also made the film for other children: "I want people who look at the film to have a different attitude next time they meet what is called a 'problem child', and develop some love and some relationship to the child -- instead of alienating him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allioff|first1=Maurie|last2=Levine|first2=Susan Schouten|title=Interview: The Long Walk of Alanis Obomsawin|journal=Cinema Canada|date=June 1987|issue=142|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inquiries==
His death sparked a provincial government inquiry, which offered 22 recommendations for improving how courts, the provincial government, schools, hospitals, aboriginal organizations and media deal with foster children—including recommendations that have been repeated at subsequent inquiries following Aboriginal youth deaths. However, a January 2014 article in the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' reported that such recommendations, which are neither binding on the government nor tracked for implementation, have largely been ignored.&lt;ref name=Henton/&gt;

==Retrospectives==
In recent years, ''Richard Cardinal: Cry from a Diary of a Métis Child'' has been featured in retrospectives at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/film_screenings/5157|title=FILM SCREENINGS|year=2008|work=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]] (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotdocs.ca/media/press_releases/hot_docs_2009_honours_canadian_filmmaker_alanis_obomsawin_with_outstanding_|title=HOT DOCS 2009 HONOURS CANADIAN FILMMAKER ALANIS OBOMSAWIN WITH OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT AWARD|date=24 March 2009|work=Press release|publisher=Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] (2013).&lt;ref name=berlinale/&gt;

'''Sammelband''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|æ|m|əl|b|æ|n|t}} {{respell|ZAM|əl|bant}}, plural '''Sammelbände''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|z|æ|m|əl|ˈ|b|ɛ|n|d|ə}} {{respell|ZAM|əl|BEN|də}} or '''Sammelbands'''),&lt;ref name="RBMS"&gt;ALA ACLR RBMS BSC. [https://rbms.info/vocabularies/provenance/tr106.htm Provenance Evidence Terms]&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes '''nonce-volume''', is a book comprising a number of separately printed or manuscript&lt;ref name="Beal"&gt;Beal, Peter. ''A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450–2000''. Oxford University Press, [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199576128.001.0001/acref-9780199576128-e-0909 online publication 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; works that are subsequently bound together.&lt;ref name="Gillespie"&gt;Gillespie, Alexandra.

==Sammelbände and William Caxton==

[[William Caxton]] appeared to follow the established manuscript tradition of producing booklets or [[fascicle (book)|fascicles]] of individual works or groups of works that would later be bought together for a patron or buyer.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Paul. The Printer and the Pardoner. From The English Historical Review.  Oxford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Nearly forty of these tract volumes have been reconstructed from the evidence of now separately bound parts.  They indicate the nature of early readership of Caxton’s work, and they also allow historians to infer something about Caxton’s own sense of his projects.

Perhaps most famous and extensive of his sammelbände work was the collection made out of Caxton's 1476-8 productions, known since the time of Caxton scholar [[William Blades]] as “the volume purchased by King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] from the estate of Bishop [[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]] in 1714.”&lt;ref&gt;Blades, William. The Life and Typography of William Caxton, vol. II, pp. 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  This volume is a compendium of Caxton’s first run of vernacular poetry, and the texts within appear as follows:

::[[John Lydgate]], ''Stans ad Mensam'' 
::Burgh, ''[[Cato’s Distichs]]''
::John Lydgate, ''The Churl and the Bird'' (2nd edn)
::John Lydgate, ''Horse Goose and Sheep'' (2nd edn)
::John Lydgate, ''The Temple of Glas''
::[[Geoffrey Chaucer]], ''The Temple of Brass'' (''[[The Parliament of Fowls]]''), also containing [[Henry Scogan]]'s ''Moral Balad'', and Chaucer’s ballads ''Truth'', ''Fortune'', and the ''Envoy to Scogan''
::''The Book of Cutesye''
::Geoffrey Chaucer, ''[[Anelida and Arcite]]'', also containing the ''Complaint to his Purse'' and a collection of verses known as the ''Sayings of Chaucer''

==Sammelbände from the Tudor Period==

Modern students of early [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] literature only rarely encounter extant ''Sammelbände'', most of which were disbound in the nineteenth century. 

Yet printed editions of works by (or ascribed to) Geoffrey Chaucer, John Lydgate, [[Richard Rolle]], [[Margery Kempe]], [[Stephen Hawes]], [[John Skelton]], and writers involved in Tudor religious controversy from [[John Wycliffe]] to [[William Tyndale]] may all be traced to such composite volumes.&lt;ref name="Gillespie"/&gt;

==Effects on literature==

In Caxton’s case specifically, he presents a Lydgatenized&lt;ref name="Lerer"&gt;Lerer, Seth. “William Caxton.” From The Cambridge History of Medieval Literature. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer, even to the point of giving the ''Parliament of Fowls'' a unique new title, ''The Temple of Brass'', to follow Lydgate’s ''Temple of Glas''. It is a testimony both to Caxton’s understanding of vernacular poetry and to the tastes of his clientele.  It is a volume centered on a particular publishing event, a volume that contains not only the key texts by canonical authors, but the critical instruction for their understanding: ''The Book of Curtesye''. 

Generally, the creation of sammelbände can have various effects on the readership of texts. It offers people a larger framework for the understanding of texts within the volumes; these volumes also used [[prologue]]s and [[epilogue]]s in order to provide a further framework for readership. These explanatory additions and the use of advertisements, such as Caxton’s “new and improved edition” of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' shows the movement away from privileged, aristocratic readership towards the readership of the middle class, solidifying printing as a business and a social progression.

Some of her storylines have included trying and failing to rebuild relationships with her children [[Carly Wicks|Carly]] ([[Kellie Shirley]]) and [[Dean Wicks|Deano]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]), a friendship with [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]), a volatile relationship with [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), the introduction of her son [[Mick Carter|Mick]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), who at first was believed to be her brother, and his family, an affair with Phil, despite his being in a relationship with [[Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) and accidentally shooting Phil. Former ''EastEnders'' executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] has described her as a "new icon" of the show.

==Storylines==
Shirley first appears, when, against her former husband [[Kevin Wicks]]'s ([[Phil Daniels]]) wishes, she introduces herself to her adult children, [[Carly Wicks|Carly]] ([[Kellie Shirley]]) and [[Dean Wicks|Dean]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]). Carly is hostile but Dean is amenable, so Shirley moves to Walford to be near them. Kevin and Shirley maintain an antagonistic relationship. Shirley attempts to sabotage his relationship with [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and threatens to tell her children about their true paternity, which she eventually does: she tells Carly her father is a man named Daniel and Dean that she does not know who his father is. Kevin had brought up Carly and Dean as his own, as well as his natural child with Shirley, [[Jimbo Wicks|Jimbo]] (Lloyd Richards), who had [[cystic fibrosis]], which Shirley struggled with and ended up walking out on the family, not attending Jimbo's funeral when he died aged 21. The revelation only drives Carly and Dean further away. When she learns that Kevin has been selling [[Lemon (automobile)|cut-and-shut]] cars, she confronts him. They try to dispose of a stolen car together but are involved in a crash, which kills Kevin. In the aftermath, Carly rejects her mother and leaves Walford. Dean, who gets in trouble with the police, is imprisoned and when released he blames Shirley for all his problems and also moves away.

Shirley begins a relationship with [[Vinnie Monks]] ([[Bobby Davro]]), at the urging of her best friend [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]), but the romance eventually ends when Vinnie learns Shirley is harbouring feelings for [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). Phil, an alcoholic, gets drunk with Shirley, uses her for sex and as a surrogate mother for his son, [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben]] (Joshua Pascoe). Shirley falls in love with Phil. She gives him an alibi when he is suspected of murder and helps him get custody of his daughter, [[Louise Mitchell|Louise]] (Brittany Papple), leading to them beginning a legitimate relationship. Shirley is so in love with Phil that she is willing to overlook his misdemeanours. She stands by him when Louise returns to her mother and Phil develops an addiction to [[crack cocaine]]. She even forgives him for several affairs, firstly with fellow addict, [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]) and secondly with [[Glenda Mitchell]] ([[Glynis Barber]]). In remorse for his wrongdoings, Phil tries to convince Shirley to marry him and she almost does but decides that marriage is unnecessary. She remains with Phil under the proviso that he never cheats on her again.

Shirley's life is thrown into turmoil when her best friend, Heather, is found dead. Unknown to Shirley, the murderer is Phil's son Ben. Phil tries to cover up Ben's involvement but Shirley grows obsessed with tracing the killer. She finds the murder weapon, a metal photo frame, in a neighbour's house and traces it to a charity shop where it was donated by Phil. She realises that Phil was involved in Heather's death and discusses her suspicions with Ben, who buckles under pressure and reveals information about Heather's death that only the murderer could know. Shirley realises that Ben killed Heather and tries to drown him in the bath, but Phil stops her. Phil convinces her not to call the police but Ben goes to the police and confesses. Unable to cope with Phil's betrayal, Shirley ends the relationship and starts drinking heavily. Phil sees that she needs help and calls Carly, who takes Shirley to stay with her and her son [[List of EastEnders characters (2012)#Jimmy|Jimmy]]. When Shirley returns, she remains hostile to Phil and takes his hush money, despite still having feelings for him.

Shirley moves into [[The Queen Victoria]] public house, when her supposed brother, [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), buys it and moves his family to Walford. After 25 years apart, she is reunited with her father, [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]). Despite their mutual hostility, Stan gives Shirley £10,000 which she invests in the pub for a 20% share. It transpires that Stan is in contact with Dean. Stan encourages a reunion with mother and son, but Dean remains hostile to Shirley. Eventually, Shirley manages to build bridges with her father and Dean. Shirley grows jealous of Phil's relationship with [[Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]). Sharon agrees to marry Phil but discovers that Phil was responsible for a break-in at her bar. Furious, Sharon decides to fleece Phil for his money in revenge. Phil discovers this, confides in Shirley and starts an affair with her, planning to jilt Sharon at the altar and resume a relationship with Shirley. However, Sharon and Phil discover their respective deceptions and ultimately decide to marry. Dejected, Shirley admits her affair with Phil after the wedding and when Phil rejects her, she shoots him. Fearing Shirley's incarceration, Shirley's aunt [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]) organises her escape. Dean is distraught and when Mick's partner, [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]), comforts him, and he rapes her. Mick and Dean eventually bring Shirley back to Walford when Stan admits he has terminal prostate cancer.

They meet Shirley's old boyfriend, [[Buster Briggs]] ([[Karl Howman]]), and Dean realises that he is Buster's son. They plan to run away together but Mick has Buster arrested for breaking his bail conditions as he is on day release. It is later revealed to viewers that Buster is also Mick's father and Shirley is actually Mick's mother, not his sister. Shirley and Mick find Shirley's mother, [[Sylvie Carter]] ([[Linda Marlowe]]), hiding at Babe's house. Sylvie has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and tells Mick she is not his mother but he dismisses this as her being confused. Shirley tries to stop Mick interacting with Sylvie, fearing her secret will be revealed. However, Sylvie is invited to Christmas dinner. Secrets are divulged at the dinner: Linda reveals Dean raped her so Mick tells Shirley before attacking Dean and is only stopped by Shirley confessing that she is his mother, not sister, and that Dean is his brother. The family is split following this revelation as Shirley sides with Dean, believing his version of events. Shirley reveals the reason why she kept her identity as Mick's mother a secret: her pregnancy with Mick was scorned by Sylvie, who attempted to force a miscarriage by pushing her down the stairs. Shirley was forced to raise Mick as her brother and Stan's son, out of fear she would never see him again. Hostilities continue and Shirley struggles to bond with Mick, due to her and Buster's continued alliance to Dean. This results in Shirley being banished from Stan's funeral, despite Shirley having nursed her father through his dying moments.

Shirley learns from Dean he has a seven-year-old daughter and confronts the child's mother, [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]), who continues to lie. Shirley is upset when Linda forbids her from seeing Ollie. [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) gives Shirley the address of Dean's daughter, verifying the child, [[Jade Green (EastEnders)|Jade Green]] (Amaya Edward), previously Roya, is alive. Shirley finds Jade but discovers she has cystic fibrosis. After Dean decides that Jade is better off without him and Shirley warns that she will fight for custody, eventually gaining Shabnam and Dean's support. When Shirley finds a bra behind her settee, she assumes Buster had sex with [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]), which Carol does not deny. Shirley nearly throws Buster out and starts considering adopting Jade alone but Carol admits that nothing happened and Shirley helps her come to terms with her mastectomy. Shirley and Buster are awarded custody of Jade after a grieving Shabnam does not contest it. Shirley prevents Dean from raping [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) and, finally believing that he is a rapist, tries to drown him in the bath but he recovers and strikes her as Linda enters. Dean then admits that he raped Linda and goes into hiding. Dean confronts Shirley at Mick and Linda's wedding and attempts to drown her. Mick saves her and Dean, who is then arrested over Roxy. Shirley then encourages Mick and Linda to get married and helps Nancy and Lee run the pub while Mick and Linda are on their honeymoon and has Jade help out to give her some work experience. She is furious when Shabnam turns up overprotective of Jade outside of her visiting hours, but after Masood tells her that Shabnam is unlikely to have any more children, she grows sympathetic and allows Jade to spend more time with Shabnam.

She finds Phil binge drinking, where he admits that he drunk-drove and crashed a car with him, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and Sharon's son [[Dennis Rickman Jnr]] ([[Bleu Landau]]), and Ian took the blame for driving. Shirley encourages Phil to tell Sharon what really happened, and when he eventually does later that night, Sharon ends their marriage. The following day, Shirley learns from Louise ([[Tilly Keeper]]) that Phil has been rushed to hospital and his liver is damaged. Sharon, [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) and Shirley go to the hospital only to find that Phil has discharged himself. They find Phil drunk at the pub, where he insults his family and hits Kathy. Shirley throws Phil out and admits to Buster that she still has feelings for Phil and is upset as he is risking his health. Buster comforts her and tells her she should move on from Phil because he only cares about himself. A month later, Shirley receives another visiting order from Dean, and eventually decides to visit Dean in prison, to encourage him to plead guilty for trying to rape Roxy. Dean, however, is in denial so Shirley threatens to disown him permanently if he pleads not guilty. The next day, Shabnam tells Shirley, Buster and Jade that she is moving to Ealing so Jade can visit her anytime. In court, Shirley watches as Dean pleads not guilty, much to her disgust. However, due to his failure to surrender to custody on numerous previous occasions, Dean is remanded in custody and a trial in June. Realising that Jade needs protecting from Dean and should be with her mother, Shirley and Buster tell Shabnam that they would like Jade to live with her full-time, giving her full custody, which she accepts. Shirley, unaware that Buster is having an affair with Kathy, is furious when he pays off their acquitted son, Dean, with all their savings, but is later devastated when Buster leaves Walford without saying goodbye to her, whilst she is in the midst of helping Phil end his alcoholism. Mick suggests to Shirley that Buster had an affair with Denise, who is now heavily pregnant. However, when Shirley confronts Denise, Denise confesses she is expecting Phil's son, which is overheard by Sharon.

Babe breaches the pub licence when she inadvertently sells alcohol to an undercover police officer, and the police arrive and arrest Mick, Babe and Shirley.  They are formally charged with breaching their pub licence, remaining in custody until their appearance in court the following morning. Shirley later catches Babe stealing money from the safe, and discover that she stolen the entire money that her father left her, Mick and Tina in his will causing Mick to evict her.
Shirley and Mick then disgusted to learn that Lee has assaulted his wife [[Whitney Dean|Whitney Carter]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) during a heated argument. Mick confides in Shirley; she strongly advises Mick to tell Lee that he must leave Whitney, which he does so. Shirley and Tina later have arguments as to whether they should put Sylvie in a home as Shirley does not want to look after her as she can see the trouble Mick is in. Realising Mick will never be able to pay the £20,000 fine ordered by the court, Shirley decides to put the blame on herself and she tells the police she knew Babe was breaching their licence but did nothing about it. She is subsequently charged with perverting the cause of justice. Although the Carters initially think that Shirley will only be in prison for six weeks, they are heartbroken to learn that her sentence has been doubled, meaning that she will stay in prison for three months. Tina visits Shirley in prison to inform her of Sylvie's death which doesn't seem to upset Shirley but later when her cellmate [[list of EastEnders characters (2017)#others (Debbie Morton)|Debbie Morton]] ([[Beth Cordingly]]) teases Shirley about her feelings, Shirley beats her up in their cell.

==Development==
Shirley's creation was announced in September 2006, at which time she was described as being "brassy, rough, tarty and tough-as-old-boots" by media entertainment website ''[[Digital Spy]]''.&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a36793/new-bad-girl-for-eastenders.html|title=New 'Bad Girl' for 'EastEnders'|last=Green|first=Kris|date=8 September 2006|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry, who had appeared in the serial during the early 1990s as prostitute [[Lorraine Salter]], said: "I'm thrilled to be joining ''EastEnders''. I'm both nervous and excited as I've watched it for many years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.rte.ie/arts/2006/0911/eastenders.html|title=Former Bad Girl to join EastEnders|work=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] | date = 11 September 2006| accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created as an extension of the established Wicks family,&lt;ref name="Wicks"/&gt; Shirley's arrival was welcomed by her son, Deano. Di Angelo deemed his character "very fond" of his mother, keen to forge a relationship with her, and attributed Deano's childish characterisation to her absence during his formative years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a44521/matt-di-angelo.html|title=Matt di Angelo|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=1 April 2007|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other relatives were less enthused by her arrival: Shirley developed a rivalry with Wicks matriarch [[Pat Butcher|Pat]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]), which culminated in a physical fight and their arrest in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a45380/eastenders-pat-fight-pics.html|title='EastEnders' Pat-fight pics|last=Green|first=Kris|date=18 April 2007|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Digital Spy''{{'s}} Dek Hogan highlighted a similarity between the two, and commented prior to their fight that Shirley was "''so'' like Pat was when she first arrived it's frightening."&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/dekstvdiary/a42208/the-blessing-of-pan.html|title=The Blessing of Pan|last=Hogan|first=Dek|date=28 January 2007|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A friendship developed between Shirley and local businessman Phil Mitchell in 2008, as she underwent a breast-cancer scare. Reluctant to seek medical help, Shirley admitted to Phil that she was afraid, and he responded with "genuine kindness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/interviews/shirley-finds-a-friend-in-phil/2913|title=Shirley finds a friend in Phil|date=6 March 2008|work=[[What's on TV]]|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their friendship developed into romance, and Shirley was later able to save him from an addiction to crack cocaine, which Henry felt reflected the strength of their relationship. Although Shirley was wounded to discover he had been unfaithful to her, Henry explained that, regardless of the tough façade her character projected, she still loved him. She characterised Shirley as "a strong, proud woman [who] wouldn't stay with someone for [the wrong] reasons", and suggested they could survive the affair: "It will need effort to make it work and they'll never have the perfect relationship, but neither Phil nor Shirley would want a completely quiet life."&lt;ref name="WOTV"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/interviews/will-shirley-stop-the-wedding/12000|title=Will Shirley stop the wedding?|date=1 March 2011|work=[[What's on TV]]|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
Early in Shirley's tenure, Hogan advised viewers to "rejoice in [her] wonderful nastiness".&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt; He found her an "unpleasant" addition to the series, and though he commended Henry's portrayal, he hoped to see more possibility of redemption for Shirley, as "It's difficult to buy into a character that comes across as unremittingly unpleasant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/dekstvdiary/a42641/snow-joke.html|title=Snow Joke|last=Hogan|first=Dek|date=11 February 2007|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan called her "the most convincing drunk" in the programme for twenty years, but noted, "that really doesn't make her any less annoying and her scenes are a pain in the neck to sit through."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/dekstvdiary/a43806/feeling-sheepish.html|title=Feeling Sheepish|last=Hogan|first=Dek|date=12 March 2007|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tess Lamacraft from ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''{{'s}} ''Buzz'' magazine questioned Shirley's motivations in accepting Phil's infidelities.

==History ==

Skidmore Studio was established in 1959 as an automotive illustration studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skidmore moves to Madison Building, brings 23 jobs with it|url=http://www.modeldmedia.com/startupnews/skidmoremadisonbuildingdetroit060711.aspx|publisher=Model D|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio  built a reputation in the 1950s and 60s for illustration work completed for [[Ford]], [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Studio to Move Downtown|url=http://detroit2020.com/2011/05/27/studio-to-move-downtown/|publisher=Detroit2020|accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the mid 1970s, the studio worked exclusively on automotive advertising with local and national advertising agencies such as [[Campbell Ewald]], [[Leo Burnett Worldwide]], [[McCann Erickson|McCann Worldwide]], [[J. Walter Thompson|Team Detroit]] and Doner.&lt;ref name="Snyder2007"&gt;{{cite news|last=Snyder|first=Christine|title=Royal Oak studio expands its client list|newspaper=The Detroit News|date=March 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Skidmore employed many notable illustrators in addition to Leo Skidmore including Ron Alexander, John Ball, Ann Bauer, Stephen Magsig, Scott Olds and Bryan Stolzenburg.

In the early 1990s, Leo Skidmore’s daughter Mae Skidmore assumed ownership of the studio. With then Vice President Tim Smith, Skidmore expanded the studio’s offering and client base to include corporate clients such as the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]] and Detroit Medical Center.&lt;ref name="Snyder2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gosselin|first=Gary|title=Executive Profile: Tim Smith, President, Skidmore|newspaper=Oakland Business Review|date=21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maurer|first=Katie|title=Branching Out: Surviving meant change|newspaper=Crain's Detroit Business|date=19 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, then-president Tim Smith, acquired majority interest of the studio and became CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People making news|url=http://www.freep.com/print/article/20100117/BUSINESS06/1170548/People-making-news|accessdate=19 January 2010|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|date=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Risky investment pays off for design studio|url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/articles/2011/02/17/business/doc4d5d83d145ec5372045286.txt|accessdate=10 May 2012|newspaper=The Oakland Press|date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the studio relocated from [[Royal Oak, Michigan]] to downtown Detroit, furthering the city's resurgence of the creative class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duggan|first=Daniel|title=Skidmore to move into Gilbert-owned Madison Theatre building|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20110526/FREE/110529925#|accessdate=10 May 2012|newspaper=Crain's Detroit Business|date=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oosting|first=Jonathan|title=Detroit 2.0 momentum: Skidmore Studio relocating downtown in Madison Theatre building|url=http://www.mlive.com/business/detroit/index.ssf/2011/05/webward_avenue_expansion_skidm.html|accessdate=10 May 2012|newspaper=MLive|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Tom|title=Tom Walsh: Creative corridor no longer so far-fetched|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/2395061811.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+10%2C+2011&amp;author=&amp;pub=Detroit+Free+Press&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=B.1&amp;desc=Creative+corridor+not+so+kooky+now|accessdate=10 May 2012|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|date=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skidmore Studio now resides as the anchor tenant of the historic Madison Theatre Building, an entrepreneurial hub for creative and tech companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=John|title=Skidmore Studio to anchor Madison Theatre Building|url=http://www.freep.com/fdcp/?unique=1307366612249|accessdate=6 June 2011|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Tom|title=Tom Walsh: Creative corridor in Detroit no longer so far-fetched|url=http://www.freep.com/fdcp/?unique=1311002263315|accessdate=18 July 2011|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|date=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio occupies the entire fourth floor of the Madison, taking up 9,800 square feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duggan|first=Daniel|title=Next brick in Gilbert's real estate empire: First National|newspaper=Crain's Detroit Business|date=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wayland|first=Michael|title=Skidmore Studio becomes anchor for Dan Gilbert's Madison Theatre entrepreneurial hub|url=http://www.mlive.com/business/detroit/index.ssf/2011/10/skidmore_studio_becomes_anchor.html|accessdate=8 May 2012|newspaper=MLive|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was purchased in November 2010 by [[Dan Gilbert (businessman)|Dan Gilbert]], Chairman and Founder of [[Quicken Loans]] as part of his Detroit real estate initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duggan|first=Daniel|title=David Friedman: Mapped a secret buying plan|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20110821/FREE/308219943/david-friedman-mapped-a-secret-buying-plan|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=Crain's Detroit Business|date=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suzanne Ciani''' (born June 4, 1946) is an American pianist, composer and [[sound designer]] who found early success with innovative [[electronic music]] and is also known for her work with [[quadraphonic sound]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/suzanne-ciani-live-quadraphonic/|title=Analog Surround-Sound Is Reborn on a New Quadraphonic LP|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Education==
Of Italian descent, she received [[classical music]] training at [[Wellesley College]] and obtained her [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in music composition in 1970 at [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she met and was influenced by the [[synthesizer]] designer, [[Don Buchla]]. She studied [[computer generated music]] with [[John Chowning]] and [[Max Mathews]] at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]] Labs in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outsight Radio Hours interview|url=https://archive.org/details/SuzanneCianiOnOutsightRadioHours|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in music==
In 1974 she formed her own company, Ciani/Musica, and, using a Buchla Analog [[modular synthesizer|Modular Synthesizer]], composed scores for television commercials for corporations such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[Merrill Lynch]], [[AT&amp;T]] and [[General Electric]]. Besides music, her specialty was reproducing [[sound effects]] on the synthesizer, that recording engineers had found difficult to record properly; the sound of a bottle of [[Coca-Cola]] being opened and poured was one of Ciani's most widely recognized works, and was used in a series of radio and television commercials in the late 1970s. She is also responsible for "logo" sounds pertaining to Energizer and ABC.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, p. 778.&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the demand for her services, that at one point she was doing up to 50 sessions a week. Her sound effects also appeared in video games (the pinball game ''[[Xenon (pinball)|Xenon]]'' featured her voice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=2821 Xenon at the Internet Pinball Database]&lt;/ref&gt;). Such audio logos as the [[Coca-Cola]] pop and pour along with video game sound effects and more appear on the 2012 album ''Lixiviation'' (Finders Keepers) along with the only currently available excerpts from her 1975 Buchla Concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outsight Radio Hours interview|url=https://archive.org/details/SuzanneCianiOnOutsightRadioHours|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Ciani provided the sound effects for [[Meco]]'s [[Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk|disco version]] of the [[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (soundtrack)|''Star Wars'' soundtrack]], which was [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]]. She added the signature electronic "swoosh" to ''[[Afternoon Delight]]'' by the [[Starland Vocal Band]]. At the time, Ciani thought the work was just a "song about spaceships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outsight Radio Hours interview|url=https://archive.org/details/SuzanneCianiOnOutsightRadioHours|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ciani scored the [[Lily Tomlin]] movie ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Woman]]'', distinguishing her as the first solo female composer of a major Hollywood film; [[Lloyd Williams (filmmaker)|Lloyd Williams]]'s 1975 experimental film ''Rainbow's Children''; and a 1986 documentary about [[Mother Teresa]], as well the TV daytime serial ("soap opera") ''[[One Life to Live]]''. She also composed the 1976 [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Columbia Pictures Television]] theme jingles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doran|first1=John|title=Modular Love: Suzanne Ciani Interviewed|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/08406-suzanne-ciani-interview|accessdate=20 January 2015|work=[[The Quietus]]|date=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has toured throughout the United States, Italy, Spain, and Asia. In 1980, Ciani demonstrated several of her sound effects on [[The David Letterman Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hutchinson|first1=Kate|title=Making sounds with Suzanne Ciani, America's first female synth hero|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/20/suzanne-ciani-america-female-synth-hero|accessdate=December 19, 2017|work=The Guardian|date=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while she started performing her own music, Letterman cut her to a commercial break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richards|first1=Chris|title=Suzanne Ciani’s retrospective showcases her groundbreaking musical fireworks|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/suzanne-cianis-retrospective-showcases-her-groundbreaking-musical-fireworks/2012/02/15/gIQA7K3tXR_story.html|accessdate=December 19, 2017|work=Washington Post|date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 Ciani began to record albums in the [[New-age music|new-age]] genre, characterized by a mix of electronic and traditional instruments. Her first album, ''Seven Waves'', was initially released in Japan in 1982, and later released in her native US in 1984 through [[Atlantic Records]]. Most of the album was produced using [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[Roland MC-8 Microcomposer|MC-8]] and [[Roland MC-4 Microcomposer|MC-4]] [[music sequencer]]s, combined with a [[Prophet 5]] [[synthesizer]] and [[Roland TR-808]] [[drum machine]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/DB_Magazine_1982_07#page/n25/mode/2up ''db: The Sound Engineering Magazine'', July 1972, pages 28-32]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 1986 album ''The Velocity of Love'', released by [[RCA Records]], featured Ciani's best known song, the title track. In 1987 she signed to the [[Private Music]] label, which released a number of albums from 1988 to 1992, including re-issues of her first two albums. Although emphasizing electronic music in her recordings, her solo piano album ''Pianissimo'', from 1990, became her best-selling album. Ciani ended her contract with Private Music with the compilation ''The Private Music of Suzanne Ciani'', in 1992.

In the 1990s Ciani founded her own music label, Seventh Wave, on which she has released all her subsequent albums, which have been more classically oriented than her previous recordings. 1994's ''Dream Suite'' was recorded in [[Moscow]] with the Young Russia Orchestra, and was Grammy-nominated. 1999's ''Turning'' featured her first composition with lyrics, in the title track, sung by Taiwanese artist [[Chyi Yu]].

In early 2006, Ciani's ''Silver Ship'' won in The 5th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best New Age Album.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/jukebox2006.asp Independent Music Awards – 5th Annual Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228112357/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/jukebox2006.asp |date=2009-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ciani was also an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards' judging panel to support independent artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp Independent Music Awards – Past Judges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713024722/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |date=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, she started a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to fund a documentary movie on her life as an electronic music pioneer. The campaign was successful, and the award-winning&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=A Life in Waves|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4521654/awards|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; film, titled ''A Life in Waves'', had its premiere on March 12, 2017 at the [[South by Southwest]] Festival, did the festival rounds and is now released on DVD.

In 2016, Ciani released ''Sunergy'', a collaboration using [[Buchla synthesizer]]s with the musician [[Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith]], as part of the [[RVNG Intl.]] FRKWYS Series.&lt;ref&gt;http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22300-sunergy/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Ciani was awarded the 2017 [[Moog Music Innovation Award]], to be awarded at [[Moogfest]] later in the year.&lt;ref name="MoogFest17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcing Suzanne Ciani as the Recipient of the 2017 Moog Innovation Award|url=http://moogfest.com/news/suzanne-ciani-to-be-awarded-the-2017-moog-music-innovation-award|website=MoogFest|publisher=[[Moog Music]]|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On her birthday '''June 4th, 2018''', Ciani with producer [http://cykik.com KamranV] released ''LIVE Quadraphonic'' with a numbered Quadraphonic vinyl package available for direct pre-order and at Ace Hotel locations around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.emusician.com/thewire/suzanne-ciani-masters-live-quadraphonic-vinyl-at-bernies|title=Suzanne Ciani Masters "LIVE Quadraphonic" Vinyl at Bernie's|work=EMusician|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The performance, recorded live at Gray Area in San Francisco on March 5, 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://grayarea.org/event/moogfest-dial-tones/|title=Moogfest: Dial-Tones with Suzanne Ciani - Gray Area Art &amp; Technology|work=Gray Area Art &amp; Technology|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was her first solo Buchla synthesizer performance in 40 years, beginning a string of exclusively quadraphonic performances around the world at events including Ableton LOOP, Marfa Myths, MOCA Detroit, Moogfest, Terraforma, Red Bull Music Academy, Sonar, and SXSW. This release was the first quadraphonic vinyl release in over 30 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prosoundnetwork.com/recording/the-unlikely-return-of-quadraphonic-vinyl|title=The Unlikely Return of Quadraphonic Vinyl|work=ProSoundNetwork.com|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Suzanne’s performance at Gray Area, like every other since that day have been in the long forgotten [[Quadraphonic sound|Quadraphonic format]]; the earliest true 360° listening format of which the original [[Buchla 200]] synthesizer natively output via the Buchla 227 quad output module. Since that performance, a global array of sonic experts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prosoundnetwork.com/recording/the-unlikely-return-of-quadraphonic-vinyl|title=The Unlikely Return of Quadraphonic Vinyl|work=ProSoundNetwork.com|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; have worked together to rebirth this Quadraphonic vinyl LP.

For this experimental release and inspired by the Buchla '''227''' quad output module, there is a limited edition of only '''227''' LPs, numbered, 45 rpm, 180g quadraphonic vinyl discs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/suzanne-ciani-live-quadraphonic/|title=Analog Surround-Sound Is Reborn on a New Quadraphonic LP|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; sold, plus a custom quadraphonic hardware decoder made in collaboration with [http://involveaudio.com/ Involve Audio] to decode two channels of audio from the vinyl disc back to the four-channel recording. The vinyl discs were pressed at [[Jack White]]’s [[Third Man Records|Third Man Pressing plant]] in Detroit, MI and are fully compatible for play with any vinyl playback systems in stereo. Current owners of vintage [[QS Regular Matrix|Regular Matrix]] quadraphonic receivers (and to a slightly less accurate degree [[Dolby Pro Logic II]] receivers in music mode) may also listen to ''LIVE Quadraphonic'' in quad via any format: digital download, streaming, radio broadcast or vinyl.

To celebrate Suzanne Ciani’s LIVE Quadraphonic release, [[dublab]] live broadcast the album from its vinyl test pressing as a part of its annual pledge drive, June 4th, 2018 at Noon Pacific Time. The nearly 20-year-old nonprofit pioneer of online radio also had Suzanne live on-the-air for a live interview.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5359">[[File:TassilokelchSchreibmayr-2.jpg|thumb|The Tassilo Chalice, c. 780 (reproduction)]]
The '''Tassilo Chalice''' is a bronze [[chalice (cup)|chalice]], gilded with silver and gold, dating from the 8th century. The chalice is of [[Anglo-Saxon]] design, and has probably been at  [[Kremsmünster Abbey]], Austria since shortly after it was made.

== History ==
Dating from c. 770-790 AD, the chalice was donated by [[Liutperga]], wife of the [[Bavaria]]n [[Duke]] [[Tassilo III of Bavaria|Tassilo III]], possibly on the occasion of the establishment of the [[Benedictine]] [[Abbey]] at [[Kremsmünster]] in 777.

The chalice is composed of an egg-shaped cup, a large knop (ornamental knob), and a relatively narrow foot (base). The chalice is cast in bronze that has been gilded with gold and silver and decorated by various methods, including [[niello]] engraving and [[chip-carving]]. It stands 25.5&amp;nbsp;cm high, and weighs 3.05&amp;nbsp;kg; its cup holds approximately 1.75 litres.

The interlinked oval medallions round the cup show Christ (together with the initials "I" and "S", for ''Iesus Salvator'') and four [[Evangelist portrait]]s, each [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]] with his symbol.  Round the base are [[icon]]s of the [[Virgin Mary]], [[John the Baptist]], and, according to an uncertain interpretation, the [[Lombards|Lombard]] queen [[Theodolinda]].  The [[Celtic knot|interlace]] decoration which covers most of the rest of the exterior contains some animals.&lt;ref&gt;CR Dodwell, ''Anglo-Saxon Art, A New Perspective'',pp 208-9; 1982, Manchester UP, {{ISBN|0-7190-0926-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the foot is the [[Latin language|Latin]] inscription: TASSILO DUX FORTIS + LIVTPIRG VIRGA REGALIS.&lt;ref name="cat"&gt;{{Citation | last =Thurston | first =Herbert  | contribution =Chalice | year =1908 | title =The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] | volume =III | place=New York | publisher =Robert Appleton Company | contribution-url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03561a.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chalice is an outstanding and original object, possibly made by [[Northumbria]]n craftsmen, decorated with [[Insular art|Hiberno-Saxon]] ornament typical of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution =Tassilo Chalice | year =2002–2007 | title =Archaeology Wordsmith | editor-last =Kipfer | editor-first =Barbara Ann, PhD  | volume = | pages = | place= | publisher = | id = | url =http://www.reference-wordsmith.com/cgi-bin/lookup.cgi?exact=1&amp;terms=Tassilo+Chalice | accessdate =23 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style is more typical of the Anglo-Saxon rather than Irish component of this hybrid style.  There is evidence that monks themselves were trained as [[goldsmith]]s in the insular period, like St. [[Dunstan]], a 10th-century [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and [[Salzburg]] for example, was a centre of the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]].

The care and artistry with which it was worked and the rich decoration show that it was the product of the highest craftsmanship of the day. Although church synods held in the 8th and 9th centuries expressly prohibited the use of copper and bronze for use in [[consecration|consecrated]] chalices,&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{Citation | title =Metalwork | encyclopedia =Encyclopædia Britannica Online | publisher =Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | year =2007 | url =http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-583996/Tassilo-Chalice | accessdate =23 July 2007 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is one of a few surviving examples of such vessels from that time.

The character of the ornamentation shows clearly the predominance of [[Insular art|Insular]] and [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] influences, even though it may have been made on the Continent. Its place of manufacture is uncertain, and it may have been produced in [[northern Italy]], but [[Mondsee (town)|Mondsee]] or [[Salzburg]] have also been suggested. Together with the [[Ardagh Chalice]] and the [[Derrynaflan Chalice]] and associated [[paten]], all of Irish origin, it is one of the most impressive of the very few surviving large pieces of Insular church metalwork – most examples of the style are secular brooches.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ryan in: Susan Youngs (ed), ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th-9th centuries AD'', 1989, British Museum Press, London, {{ISBN|0-7141-0554-6}}. The survey here (pp 125-8) lists only five Irish chalices from the 8th and 9th centuries, and does not include the Tassilo chalice.&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo-Saxon metalwork was highly regarded as far away as Italy, and especially noted for its engraving, but even fewer pieces have survived than from Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell op cit pp.188-215, esp. 202-210&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The George Sugarman Foundation, Inc.''' is a [[non-profit]] [[organization]] founded in 2001 to honor the memory and wishes of [[George Sugarman]].

==History==

George Sugarman (1912–1999) was an [[United States|American]] [[artist]] working in the mediums of [[drawing]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]].  Often described as controversial and forward-thinking, Sugarman's prolific body of work defies a definitive style. He pioneered the concepts of pedestal-free sculpture and is best known for his large-scale, vividly painted metal sculptures.  His innovative approach to art-making lent his work a fresh, experimental approach and caused him to continually expand his creative focus. During his lifetime, he was dedicated to the well-being of young emerging artists, particularly those who embraced innovation and risk-taking in their work.  In his will, Sugarman provided for the establishment of The George Sugarman Foundation, Inc. 

==Foundation work==

From 2001–2008, the George Sugarman Foundation awarded monetary [[grants]] to emerging [[visual artists]] who were engaged in creating new works of fine art and whose work showed promise and conceptual innovation.  As of 2009, the George Sugarman Foundation, Inc. shifted its focus away from offering grants to artists in order to serve the wishes of George Sugarman through the donation of his artwork to American [[institutions]], [[museums]], and [[universities]].

'''The Thing''' is an international net-community of artists and art-related projects that was started in 1991 by [[Wolfgang Staehle]]. The Thing was launched as a mailbox system accessible over the telephone network in New York feeding a [[Bulletin Board System]] (BBS) in 1991 before their website was launched in 1995 on the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], ''Art and Electronic Media''. London: Phaidon, 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, The Thing grew into a diverse online community made up of dozens of members' Web sites, mailing lists, a successful Web hosting service, a community studio in Chelsea (NYC), and the first Web site devoted to [[Net Art]]: bbs.thing.net.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana. ''New Media Art''. Cologne: Taschen Verlag. pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== The Thing BBS (1991)===
In 1991, The Thing began as a [[Bulletin Board System]] (BBS) focusing on contemporary art and cultural theory.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Daniels, Gunther Reisinger (Eds.) “Net Pioneers 1.0: Contextualizing Early Net-Based Art”, Sternberg. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the writer and critic Blackhawk (having recently produced the film ''[[Cyberpunk]]'') taught Wolfgang Staehle many of the abilities he needed to start the original The Thing BBS. Blackhawk was the first person Staehle turned to after conceiving the idea for an electronic culture resource based on the model of [[Joseph Beuys]]'s ''[[Social sculpture]]''. Blackhawk and Wolfgang jointly set up the editorial structure of the original BBS and planned for many of the then experimental activities that took place. Other people who helped develop and shape the content of the early BBS included [[Josefina Ayerza]], [[Dike Blair]], Donald Newman, the original programmer, Jordan Crandall, David Platzker, Josh Decter, [[Rainer Ganahl]], [[Julia Scher]], [[Barry Schwabsky]], Morgan Garwood, Franz von Stauffenberg and Benjamin Weil.

A second node, The Thing Cologne, was added in 1992, followed by The Thing Vienna in November 1993. Nodes in Berlin and elsewhere were soon to follow.

===The Thing on the Web (1995)===
The Thing changed its form when a website was created for a presentation at the 1995 [[Ars Electronica]]. Credits on the 1995 website also name Nicky Chaikin, [[John F. Simon Jr.]], [[Wolfgang Staehle]], Rob Keenan, Darryl Erentzen and John Rabasa.&lt;ref&gt;http://old.thing.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 The Thing set up an independent art network with hardware of its own that offered arts communities ways to establish themselves, to send information to one another and also to conceive of new artistic practices deriving from [[conceptual art]] and from [[performance art]]. The idea was that working with the Internet was a way to operate around the institutions of art distribution of the day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana. ''New Media Art''. Cologne: Taschen Verlag. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Max Kossatz designed ''The Thing Communicator'' a website mimicking many functions of the original BBS including member login, chat and messaging.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]], ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd., p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

The most [[interactive]] area of The Thing consisted of various message boards offering forums for [[art theory]] debate, news and gossip, ongoing dialogue and an open-access flow of information as well as several online versions of art journals.

Alongside discussion forums The Thing has offered artworks in the form of [[graphics]] downloadable to the home [[personal computer]] – for example by [[Peter Halley]].

===thing.net communities===
The Thing has enabled a diverse group of artists, critics, curators, and activists to use the internet in its early stages. At its core, The Thing is a [[social network]], made up of individuals from diverse backgrounds with a wide range of expert knowledge. From this social hub, The Thing has built an array of programs and initiatives, in both technological and cultural networks. During its first five years, TT became widely recognized as one of the founding and leading online centers for [[new media]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]], ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd., p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities include hosting artists' projects and mailing lists - as well as publishing cultural criticism.

The Thing has also organized many public events and symposia on such topics as the state of [[new media]] arts, the preservation of online privacy, artistic innovations in [[robotics]], and the possibilities of community empowerment through wireless technologies.

In 1997, thing.net communications, LLC, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) was incorporated by Wolfgang Staehle, Gisela Ehrenfried and Max Kossatz.  The ISP was to provide a financial backbone for The Thing Inc. (a 501 c 3 non profit organization).  thing.net has hosted arts and activist groups and publications including [[P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center]], [[Artforum]], [[Mabou Mines]], [[Willoughby Sharp]] Gallery, [[Zingmagazine]],  Journal of Contemporary Art, [[RTMark]] and Tenant.net.

Among many others, artists and projects associated with thing.net have included Sawad Brooks, [[Heath Bunting]], Cercle Ramo Nash, [[Vuk Cosic]], [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)|Ricardo Dominguez]], [[Ursula Endlicher]], [[etoy]], [[GH Hovagimyan]], Jérôme Joy, [[John Klima (artist)|John Klima]], Jenny Marketou, [[Mariko Mori]], [[Olivier Mosset]], Prema Murty, [[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Phil Niblock]], Daniel Pflumm, [[Francesca da Rimini]], [[Beat Streuli]] and Beth Stryker.

== Biography ==
Celms was educated at the [[Art Academy of Latvia]]. He is considered one of the founders of [[kinetic art]] in Latvia due to his exploration of the artform in the 1960s. He became prominent in the Latvian artworld in the 1970s with his kinetic art, [[photomontage]]s and [[graphic design]].&lt;ref&gt;Līga Rušeniece. 14 November 2016.

In 2007 he published the book ''Latvju raksts un zīmes'' ("Latvian Patterns and Symbols") which went on to sell well. In 2016 he published ''Baltu dievestības pamati'' ("Fundamentals of the Baltic Gods"), where he, influenced by [[Ernests Brastiņš]], [[Marija Gimbutas]] and [[Janīna Kursīte-Pakule]], gives an introduction to the Baltic deities and how to be aware of them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lsm.lv/raksts/dzive--stils/tautas-maksla/iznakusi-valda-celma-gramata-par-baltu-dievibam.a214812/ Iznākusi Valda Celma grāmata par baltu dievībām]. 15 December 2016.

'''Visual ethics''' is an emerging interdisciplinary field of scholarship that brings together religious studies, philosophy, photo and video journalism, visual arts, and [[cognitive science]] in order to explore the ways human beings relate to others ethically through visual perception. Historically, the field of [[ethics]] has relied heavily on rational-linguistic approaches, largely ignoring the importance of seeing and visual representation to human moral behavior. At the same time, studies in [[visual culture]] tend to analyze imagistic representations while ignoring many of the ethical dimensions involved. Visual ethics is a field of cross-fertilization of ethics and visual culture studies that seeks to understand how the production and reception of visual images is always ethical, whether or not we are consciously aware of this fact.

== Ethics of visual production ==

On the one hand, visual ethics is concerned with ethical issues involved in the production of visual images. For example, how do representations in newsmedia deploy cultural codes of race, class, ethnicity, gender, and so on in order to create distance from or empathy with specific people and groups? How can visual representations of the other facilitate or foreclose certain ethical responses from viewers? When is it ethically justifiable to capture and share images of another person in a moment of vulnerability? With whom should such images be shared?

== Ethics of visual reception ==

Visual ethics is equally concerned with the ethics of reception, that is, with seeing as an ethical act. How do different images influence our ethical responses and moral behavior in different ways? To what extent do our ethical responses to images take place pre-reflectively, by visual-perceptual processes in the body-mind, before images even come to consciousness? It can be looked upon more into the cultural perception. It always depends on the cultural background.

==Ethics and visual arts==

This topic focuses on ethical theories and methods of ethical reasoning.  Controversies and arguments abound as ethical decisions, or the lack thereof, continue to play a role in institutional practice. With the increasing gap between commerce and culture, the prioritization of good business over public service creates an increasingly blurry set of ethical guidelines. Collector-based exhibitions, conflicts of interest, and the de-accessioning practices of collections.  One might ask do museums have a responsibility to their public? And if so, is this a part of institutional culture and is it being taught in today’s museum studies programs?  [[Elaine A. King]] and co-editor Gail Levin addressed many of these issues in the anthology they compiled titled "Ethics and The Visual Arts" published in September 2006 by Allworth Press in New York. This volume of 19 essays explores a diverse range of topics about ethics in the visual arts.  The dark side of the arts is explored in this volume with nineteen diverse essays by such distinguished authors as Eric Fischl, Suzaan Boettger, Stephen Weil, Richard Serra, and more cover a broad range of topics facing today’s artists, policy makers, art lawyers, galleries, museum professionals, and more.

== Visual Ethics Symposium ==

In April 2007, under the direction of [[Timothy Beal]] of the Baker-Nord Center for the Humanities and William E. Deal of the Inamori Center for Ethics at [[Case Western Reserve University]] hosted an interdisciplinary group of scholars in the fields of philosophical ethics, religious studies, theology, visual culture studies, neuroscience, and cognitive science to develop the first research collaboration on visual ethics.
