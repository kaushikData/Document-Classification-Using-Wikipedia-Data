[[File:ApertureDefn1707.png|right|thumb|244px|Definitions of ''Aperture'' in the 1707 ''Glossographia Anglicana Nova''&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Blount (Lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]], ''Glossographia Anglicana Nova: Or, A Dictionary, Interpreting Such Hard Words of whatever Language, as are at present used in the English Tongue, with their Etymologies, Definitions, &amp;c.

In [[optics]], an '''aperture''' is a hole or an opening through which [[light]] travels.  More specifically, the aperture and [[focal length]] of an [[optical system]] determine the cone angle of a bundle of [[ray (optics)|rays]] that come to a [[focus (optics)|focus]] in the [[image plane]].

An optical system typically has many openings or structures that limit the ray bundles (ray bundles are also known as ''pencils'' of light).  These structures may be the edge of a [[lens (optics)|lens]] or [[mirror]], or a ring or other fixture that holds an optical element in place, or may be a special element such as a [[diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]] placed in the optical path  to limit the light admitted by the system.  In general, these structures are called stops,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and the '''aperture stop''' is the stop that primarily determines the [[Exit pupil|ray cone angle and brightness]] at the [[Cardinal point (optics)|image point]].

In some contexts, especially in [[photography]] and [[astronomy]], ''aperture'' refers to the ''diameter'' of the aperture stop rather than the physical stop or the opening itself. For example, in a [[telescope]], the aperture stop is typically the edges of the [[objective lens]] or mirror (or of the mount that holds it). One then speaks of a telescope as having, for example, a 100-centimeter ''aperture''. Note that the aperture stop is not necessarily the smallest stop in the system. Magnification and demagnification by lenses and other elements can cause a relatively large stop to be the aperture stop for the system. In [[astrophotography]], the aperture may be given as a linear measure (for example in inches or mm) or as the dimensionless ratio between that measure and the [[focal length]]. In other photography, it is usually given as a ratio.

Sometimes stops and diaphragms are called apertures, even when they are not the aperture stop of the system.

The word ''aperture'' is also used in other contexts to indicate a system which blocks off light outside a certain region. In astronomy, for example, a [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] aperture around a [[star]] usually corresponds to a circular window around the image of a star within which the light intensity is assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Eaton, Peter W. Draper &amp; Alasdair Allan, [http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/star/docs/sun45.htx/node36.html Techniques of aperture photometry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311210838/http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/star/docs/sun45.htx/node36.html |date=11 March 2007 }} in  PHOTOM -- A Photometry Package, 20 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
The aperture stop is an important element in most optical designs. Its most obvious feature is that it limits the amount of light that can reach the image/[[film plane]]. This can be either unavoidable, as in a telescope where one wants to collect as much light as possible; or deliberate, to prevent saturation of a detector or overexposure of film. In both cases, the size of the aperture stop is constrained by things other than the amount of light admitted; however:
*The size of the stop is one factor that affects [[depth of field]]. &lt;!-- There is some confusion here. So let's be clear: Long depth of field occurs when the lens opening, and thus the stop, is small. However, a small opening equals a large f-stop number. --&gt; Smaller stops (larger [[f number]]s) produce a longer [[depth of field]], allowing objects at a wide range of distances to all be in focus at the same time.
*The stop limits the effect of optical [[Aberration in optical systems|aberrations]]. If the stop is too large, the image will be distorted. More sophisticated optical system designs can mitigate the effect of aberrations, allowing a larger stop and therefore greater light collecting ability.
*The stop determines whether the image will be [[vignetting|vignetted]]. Larger stops can cause the intensity reaching the film or detector to fall off toward the edges of the picture, especially when, for off-axis points, a different stop becomes the aperture stop by virtue of cutting off more light than did the stop that was the aperture stop on the optic axis.
*A larger aperture stop requires larger diameter optics, which are heavier and more expensive.

In addition to an aperture stop, a photographic lens may have one or more ''field stops'', which limit the system's [[Angle of view|field of view]].  When the field of view is limited by a field stop in the lens (rather than at the film or sensor) [[vignetting]] results; this is only a problem if the resulting field of view is less than was desired.

The [[pupil|biological pupil]] of the [[Human eye|eye]] is its aperture in optics nomenclature; the iris is the diaphragm that serves as the aperture stop. Refraction in the [[cornea]] causes the effective aperture (the [[entrance pupil]] in optics parlance) to differ slightly from the physical pupil diameter. The entrance pupil is typically about 4&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, although it can range from 2&amp;nbsp;mm ({{f/|8.3|link=yes}}) in a brightly lit place to 8&amp;nbsp;mm ({{f/|2.1}}) in the dark.

In astronomy, the diameter of the aperture stop (called the ''aperture'') is a critical parameter in the design of a [[telescope]]. Generally, one would want the ''aperture'' to be as large as possible, to collect the maximum amount of light from the distant objects being imaged. The size of the aperture is limited, however, in practice by considerations of cost and weight, as well as prevention of aberrations (as mentioned above).

Apertures are also used in laser energy control, close aperture [[z-scan technique]], diffractions/patterns, and beam cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rashidian Vaziri|first1=M R|title=Role of the aperture in Z-scan experiments: A parametric study|journal=Chinese Physics B|volume=24|issue=11|doi=10.1088/1674-1056/24/11/114206|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-1056/24/11/114206/meta|bibcode = 2015ChPhB..24k4206R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Laser applications include spatial filters, Q-switching, high intensity x-ray control.

In light microscopy, the word aperture may be used with reference to either the [[Condenser (microscope)|condenser]] (changes angle of light onto specimen field), field iris (changes area of illumination) or possibly objective lens (forms primary image). ''See'' [[Optical microscope]].

==In photography==
The aperture stop of a [[photographic lens]] can be adjusted to control the amount of [[light]] reaching the [[Photographic film|film]] or [[image sensor]]. In combination with variation of [[shutter speed]], the aperture size will regulate the film's or image sensor's degree of [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] to light.  Typically, a fast shutter will require a larger aperture to ensure sufficient light exposure, and a slow shutter will require a smaller aperture to avoid excessive exposure.

[[File:Aperture diagram.svg|right|thumb|350px|Diagram of decreasing aperture sizes (increasing [[f-number]]s) for "full stop" increments (factor of two aperture area per stop)]]

A device called a [[diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]] usually serves as the aperture stop, and controls the aperture. The diaphragm functions  much like the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] of the [[Human eye|eye]]&amp;nbsp;– it controls the effective [[diameter]] of the lens opening. Reducing the aperture size increases the [[depth of field]], which describes the extent to which subject matter lying closer than or farther from the actual plane of focus appears to be in focus. In general, the smaller the aperture (the larger the number), the greater the distance from the plane of focus the subject matter may be while still appearing in focus.

The lens aperture is usually specified as an [[f-number]], the ratio of [[focal length]] to effective aperture diameter. A lens typically has a set of marked "f-stops" that the f-number can be set to. A lower f-number denotes a greater aperture opening which allows more light to reach the film or image sensor. The photography term "one f-stop" refers to a factor of {{radic|2}} (approx. 1.41) change in f-number, which in turn corresponds to a factor of 2 change in light intensity.

[[Aperture priority]] is a semi-automatic shooting mode used in cameras. It permits the photographer to select an aperture setting and let the camera decide the shutter speed and sometimes also [[ISO sensitivity]] for the correct exposure. This is also referred to as Aperture Priority Auto Exposure, A mode, AV mode (aperture-value mode), or semi-auto mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://elite-cameras.com/articles/aperture-shutter-speed-digital-cameras.php | title=Aperture and shutter speed in digital cameras| work=elite-cameras.com| accessdate=2006-06-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060620033626/http://elite-cameras.com/articles/aperture-shutter-speed-digital-cameras.php |archivedate = 2006-06-20}} (original link no longer works, but page was saved by archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical ranges of apertures used in photography are about {{f/}}2.8–{{f/}}22 or {{f/}}2–{{f/}}16,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photoxels.com/tutorial_aperture.html What is... Aperture?]&lt;!-- f/2 instead of f/1.8 is clearer and mathematically more accurate as 1 stop faster than f/2.8 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; covering 6 stops, which may be divided into wide, middle, and narrow of 2 stops each, roughly (using round numbers) {{f/}}2–{{f/}}4, {{f/}}4–{{f/}}8, and {{f/}}8–{{f/}}16 or (for a slower lens) {{f/}}2.8–{{f/}}5.6, {{f/}}5.6–{{f/}}11, and {{f/}}11–{{f/}}22. These are not sharp divisions, and ranges for specific lenses vary.

===Maximum and minimum apertures===
{{further information|Lens speed}}
The specifications for a given lens typically include the maximum and minimum aperture sizes, for example, {{f/}}1.4–{{f/}}22. In this case, {{f/}}1.4 is the maximum aperture (the widest opening), and {{f/}}22 is the minimum aperture (the smallest opening). The maximum aperture opening tends to be of most interest and is always included when describing a lens. This value is also known as the [[lens speed|lens "speed"]], as it affects the exposure time. The aperture is proportional to the square root of the light admitted, and thus inversely proportional to the square root of required exposure time, such that an aperture of {{f/}}2 allows for exposure times one quarter that of {{f/}}4.

[[File:16 minolta 50mm.jpg|thumb|right|The aperture range of a 50mm Minolta lens, f/1.4–f/16]]

Lenses with apertures opening {{f/}}2.8 or wider are referred to as "fast" lenses, although the specific point has changed over time (for example, in the early 20th century aperture openings wider than {{f/}}6 were considered fast{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}). The fastest lenses for the common [[135 film|35 mm film]] format in general production have apertures of {{f/}}1.2 or {{f/}}1.4, with more at {{f/}}1.8 and {{f/}}2.0, and many at {{f/}}2.8 or slower; {{f/}}1.0 is unusual, though sees some use. When comparing "fast" lenses, the [[Film format|image format]] used must be considered. Lenses designed for a small format such as [[Half-frame camera|half frame]] or [[APS-C]] need to project a much smaller [[image circle]] than a lens used for [[Large format (photography)|large format]] photography. Thus the optical elements built into the lens can be far smaller and cheaper.

In exceptional circumstances lenses can have even wider apertures with f-numbers smaller than 1.0; see [[Lens speed#Fast lenses|lens speed: fast lenses]] for a detailed list. For instance, both the current Leica Noctilux-M 50mm ASPH and a 1960s-era Canon 50mm rangefinder lens have a maximum aperture of {{f/}}0.95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5048115/leicas-11000-noctilux-50mm-f095-lens-is-a-nightvision-owl-eye-for-your-camera|title=Leica's $11,000 Noctilux 50mm f/0.95 Lens Is a Nightvision Owl Eye For Your Camera|first=John|last=Mahoney|date=|website=gizmodo.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheaper alternatives have appeared in recent years, such as the [[Cosina Voigtländer]] 17.5mm {{f/}}0.95, 25mm {{f/}}0.95 and 42.5mm {{f/}}0.95 manual focus lenses for the [[Micro Four Thirds System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/855215-REG/Voigtlander_BA175M_Nokton_17_5mm_f_0_95_Lens.html|title=Voigtlander Nokton 17.5mm f/0.95 Lens for Micro Four BA175M B&amp;H|author=|date=|website=www.bhphotovideo.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/754598-REG/Voigtlander_BA305A_Nokton_25mm_f_0_95_Lens.html|title=Voigtlander BA259M2 Replacement for Voigtlander BA259M - B&amp;H|author=|date=|website=www.bhphotovideo.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1000625-REG/voigtlander_ba425m_nokton_42_5mm_f_0_95_micro.html|title=Voigtlander Nokton 42.5mm f/0.95 Micro Four Thirds Lens BA425M|author=|date=|website=www.bhphotovideo.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional lenses for some movie cameras have f-numbers as small as {{f/}}0.75. [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' has scenes shot by candlelight with a NASA/Zeiss 50mm f/0.7,&lt;ref&gt;Ed DiGiulio (President, [[Cinema Products Corporation]]). [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/len/page1.htm "Two Special Lenses for ''Barry Lyndon''"]
&lt;/ref&gt; the fastest lens in film history. Beyond the expense, these lenses have limited application due to the correspondingly shallower depth of field&amp;nbsp;– the scene must either be shallow, shot from a distance, or will be significantly defocused, though this may be the desired effect.

Zoom lenses typically have a maximum relative aperture (minimum f-number) of {{f/}}2.8 to {{f/}}6.3 through their range. High-end lenses will have a constant aperture, such as {{f/}}2.8 or {{f/}}4, which means that the relative aperture will stay the same throughout the zoom range. A more typical consumer zoom will have a variable maximum relative aperture since it is harder and more expensive to keep the maximum relative aperture proportional to the focal length at long focal lengths; {{f/}}3.5 to {{f/}}5.6 is an example of a common variable aperture range in a consumer zoom lens.

By contrast, the minimum aperture does not depend on the focal length&amp;nbsp;– it is limited by how narrowly the aperture closes, not the lens design&amp;nbsp;– and is instead generally chosen based on practicality: very small apertures have lower sharpness due to diffraction, while the added depth of field is not generally useful, and thus there is generally little benefit in using such apertures. Accordingly, DSLR lens typically have minimum aperture of {{f/}}16, {{f/}}22, or {{f/}}32, while [[large format]] may go down to {{f/}}64, as reflected in the name of [[Group f/64]]. Depth of field is a significant concern in [[macro photography]], however, and there one sees smaller apertures. For example, the [[Canon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5x Macro lens|Canon MP-E 65mm]] can have effective aperture (due to magnification) as small as {{f/}}96.  The [[Pinhole camera|pinhole]] optic for [[Lensbaby]] creative lenses has an aperture of just {{f/}}177.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lensbaby.com/optics-pinhole.php |title=Pinhole and Zone Plate Photography for SLR Cameras |work=Lensbaby Pinhole optic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501093047/http://www.lensbaby.com/optics-pinhole.php |archivedate=1 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Aperture area===
The amount of light captured by a lens is proportional to the area of the aperture, equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Area} = \pi \left({D \over 2}\right)^2 = \pi \left({f \over 2N}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Where the two equivalent forms are related via the [[f-number]] ''N = f / D'', with [[focal length]] ''f'' and aperture diameter ''D''.

The focal length value is not required when comparing two lenses of the same focal length; a value of 1 can be used instead, and the other factors can be dropped as well, leaving area proportion to the reciprocal square of the f-number ''N''.

If two cameras of different format sizes and focal lengths have the same [[angle of view]], and the same aperture area, they gather the same amount of light from the scene.  In that case, the relative focal-plane [[illuminance]], however, would depend only on the f-number ''N'', so it is less in the camera with the larger format, longer focal length, and higher f-number.  This assumes both lenses have identical transmissivity.

===Aperture control===
Most [[SLR camera]]s provide ''automatic aperture control'', which allows viewing and metering at the lens's maximum aperture, but stops the lens down to the working aperture during exposure, and returns the lens to maximum aperture afterward.&lt;ref name="Ray2000-136"&gt;Sidney F. Ray. The geometry of image formation. In ''The Manual of Photography: Photographic and Digital Imaging'', 9th ed, pp. 136–137. Ed. Ralph E. Jacobson, Sidney F. Ray, Geoffrey G. Atteridge, and Norman R. Axford. Oxford: Focal Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-240-51574-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first SLR cameras with internal ([[Through-the-lens metering|“through-the-lens” or “TTL”]]) meters (e.g., the [[Pentax Spotmatic]]) required that the lens is stopped down to the working aperture when taking a meter reading.  With a small aperture, this darkened the viewfinder, making viewing, focusing, and composition difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shipman|first=Carl|title=SLR Photographers Handbook|date=1977|publisher=HP Books|location=Tucson, AZ|isbn=0-912656-59-X|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent models soon incorporated mechanical coupling between the lens and the camera body, indicating the working aperture to the camera while allowing the lens to be at its maximum aperture for composition and focusing;&lt;ref name="Ray2000-136"/&gt; this feature became known as automatic aperture control or automatic diaphragm control.

For some lenses, including a few long [[Telephoto lens|telephotos]], lenses mounted on [[Bellows (photography)|bellows]], and [[Perspective control lens|perspective-control and tilt/shift]] lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical,&lt;ref name="Ray2000-136"/&gt; and automatic aperture control was not provided.  Many such lenses incorporated a feature known as a "preset" aperture,&lt;ref name="Ray2000-136"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. "Moose" Peterson. ''Nikon System Handbook''. New York: Images Press, 1997, pp. 42–43. {{ISBN|0-929667-03-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows the lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working aperture and full aperture without looking at the aperture control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working aperture for metering, return to full aperture for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset aperture controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens aperture rings, with one ring setting the aperture and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture.  Examples of lenses with this type of preset aperture control are the Nikon PC Nikkor 28&amp;nbsp;mm {{f/}}3.5 and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75&amp;nbsp;mm {{f/}}4.5.  The Nikon PC Micro-Nikkor 85&amp;nbsp;mm {{f/}}2.8D lens incorporates a mechanical pushbutton that sets working aperture when pressed and restores full aperture when pressed a second time.

Accessed 12 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Automatic aperture control is provided with the newer Nikon digital SLR cameras; with some earlier cameras, the lenses offer preset aperture control by means of a pushbutton that controls the electromagnetic diaphragm.

===Optimal aperture===
Optimal aperture depends both on optics (the depth of the scene versus diffraction), and on the performance of the lens.

Optically, as a lens is stopped down, the defocus blur at the Depth of Field (DOF) limits decreases but diffraction blur increases. The presence of these two opposing factors implies a point at which the combined blur spot is minimized ([[#CITEREFR Gibson1975|Gibson 1975]], 64); at that point, the &lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt;-number is optimal for image sharpness, for this given depth of field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/technical/diffraction.html|title=Diffraction and Optimum Aperture - Format size and diffraction limitations on sharpness|author=|date=|website=www.bobatkins.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a wider aperture (lower ''f''-number) causes more defocus, while a narrower aperture (higher ''f''-number) causes more diffraction.

As a matter of performance, lenses often do not perform optimally when fully opened, and thus generally have better sharpness when stopped down some&amp;nbsp;– note that this is sharpness in the plane of [[critical focus]], setting aside issues of depth of field. Beyond a certain point, there is no further sharpness benefit to stopping down, and the diffraction begins to become significant. There is accordingly a sweet spot, generally in the {{f/}}4&amp;nbsp;– {{f/}}8 range, depending on lens, where sharpness is optimal, though some lenses are designed to perform optimally when wide open. How significant this varies between lenses, and opinions differ on how much practical impact this has.

While optimal aperture can be determined mechanically, how much sharpness is ''required'' depends on how the image will be used&amp;nbsp;– if the final image is viewed under normal conditions (e.g., an 8″×10″ image viewed at 10″), it may suffice to determine the &lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt;-number using criteria for minimum required sharpness, and there may be no practical benefit from further reducing the size of the blur spot.  But this may not be true if the final image is viewed under more demanding conditions, e.g., a very large final image viewed at normal distance, or a portion of an image enlarged to normal size ([[#CITEREFR Hansma1996|Hansma 1996]]).  Hansma also suggests that the final-image size may not be known when a photograph is taken, and obtaining the maximum practicable sharpness allows the decision to make a large final image to be made at a later time; see also [[critical sharpness]].

==Equivalent aperture range==
{{See also|Image sensor format}}
In digital photography, the 35mm-equivalent aperture range is sometimes considered to be more important than the actual f-number.  Equivalent aperture is the f-number adjusted to correspond to the f-number of the same size absolute aperture diameter on a lens with a [[35mm equivalent focal length]].  Smaller equivalent f-numbers are expected to lead to higher image quality based on more total light from the subject, as well as lead to reduced depth of field.  For example, a [[Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10]] uses a 1" sensor, 24–200&amp;nbsp;mm with maximum aperture constant along the zoom range;  {{f/}}2.8 has equivalent aperture range {{f/}}7.6, which is a lower equivalent f-number than some other {{f/}}2.8 cameras with smaller sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpreview.com/previews/sony-cybershot-dsc-rx10 |title=Sony Cyber-shot DSC RX10 First Impressions Review |author=R Butler |accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In scanning or sampling==
The terms ''scanning aperture'' and ''sampling aperture'' are often used to refer to the opening through which an image is sampled, or scanned, for example in a [[Drum scanner#Drum|Drum scanner]], an [[image sensor]], or a television pickup apparatus.  The sampling aperture can be a literal optical aperture, that is, a small opening in space, or it can be a time-domain aperture for [[sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] a signal waveform.

For example, [[film grain]] is quantified as ''graininess'' via a measurement of film density fluctuations as seen through a 0.048&amp;nbsp;mm sampling aperture.

'''The Architects Act 1997''' (c. 22) is the consolidating [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] for the keeping and publishing of the statutory [[Register of Architects]] by the [[Architects Registration Board]]. It has the [[long title]]: ''An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to architects.'' It consolidated two Acts of the 1930s as later amended both by primary legislation and by Orders in Council implementing the EC directive on architects providing for the recognition of architects qualified in other EC states, and the changes which had been made by Part III&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/53/part/III/1996-10-01?timeline=true E+W+S+N.I. Architects]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970120/text/70120-03.htm#70120-03_head0 Hansard]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passage of the consolidating Bill==
The Architects Act 1997 consolidated the originating and amending Acts relating to the registration of architects, namely the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects Acts]] 1931-1996 (section 125 of the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]]).

The [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] was introduced to the [[House of Lords]] on 17 December 1996 by the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern|Lord Mackay of Clashfern]], and given its first reading.&lt;ref name="introduced"/&gt; It received its second reading without call for a debate on 20 January 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970120/text/70120-03.htm#70120-03_head0|title=House of Lords Hansard; vol 577, part 39, col 384|date=20 January 1997|work=[[Hansard]]|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was passed to the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills. On 3 March 1997 it was read for a third time without debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970303/text/70303-03.htm#70303-03_head3|title=House of Lords Hansard; vol 578, part 66, Col 1503|date=3 March 1997|work=[[Hansard]]|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&amp;STEMMER=en&amp;WORDS=17%20mar%201997%20column%20696&amp;ALL=&amp;ANY=&amp;PHRASE=%2217%20Mar%201997%20:%20Column%20696%20%22&amp;CATEGORIES=&amp;SIMPLE=&amp;SPEAKER=&amp;COLOUR=red&amp;STYLE=s&amp;ANCHOR=70317-26_spnew0&amp;URL=/pa/cm199697/cmhansrd/vo970317/debtext/70317-26.htm#70317-26_spnew0|title=House of Commons Hansard; 17 March 1997 part 26, Col 695|date=17 March 1997|work=[[Hansard]]|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill was given [[Royal Assent]] on 19 March 1997 and came into force on 21 July 1997.

==Legislative continuity==
The legislative continuity from the originating Act of 1931 to the consolidating Act of 1997 is shown by paragraph 19(2)(a) of Schedule 2 in the 1997 Act:
: ''"the Council" means the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom established under the 1931 Act, which was renamed as the Board by section 118(1) of the 1996 Act.''
The [[Architects Registration Board]] (ARB) has limited powers to make rules in the manner prescribed by the Architects Act 1997, but not the power to make regulations which had previously been ascribed to the registration body when it was constituted as the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK).

==Statutory purpose==
The Act embodied previous legislation consequent upon [[Directive (European Union)|EU directives]] concerning the mutual recognition of professional qualifications in the [[member states of the European Union]] and other [[European Economic Area|EEA]] States, and certain changes which had been made to the previous legislation after the publication of the [[Warne Report]] in 1993.

For the purpose of ascertaining the duties and functions which the Architects Registration Board is required to execute and perform under the Architects Act 1997, the constraints on the Board include the requirements judicially applicable in the name of [[administrative law]].

In May 2006 ministerial responsibility for the ARB was transferred from the ODPM to the DCLG ([[Department for Communities and Local Government]]).  The DCLG website shows that of "four categories" of "[[non-departmental public bodies]]" (NDPBs) the ARB was being classified (at the end of May 2007) as one of two "[[Statutory corporation|public corporations]]", the other one being the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;not to be confused with the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)]]&lt;/ref&gt; a body of entirely different political and legislative origin, function and capacities, so that the two have practically nothing in common. The website there briefly described the ARB as:
: ''The independent statutory regulator of all UK registered architects which has a dual mandate to protect the consumer and to safeguard the reputation of architects''.
That appears to have been more a politically advised than a factual statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/22|title=Architects Act|year=1997|work=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071116155827/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1997/1997022.htm| archivedate=November 16, 2007&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it lacks congruity with an ordinary or accurate reading of the legislation enacted by Parliament (see further information below "Accuracy of Government Information").

===Amendment in 2008 under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)]]===
[[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|Amendments]] made in June 2008 by [[Statutory Instrument]] established rules for the recognition of professional qualifications enabling migrants from the [[European Economic Area]] or [[Switzerland]] to register as architects in the United Kingdom. It also set out provisions for facilitating temporary and occasional professional services cross-border.

==Changes: before and after July 1997==
The previous legislation had enabled and required the [[Register of Architects]] to be established, maintained and published; and for that purpose there had been a Council, called the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK), which had been established as a body corporate by the originating Act, namely the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]].

The changes embodied in the [[consolidating Act]] of 1997 had first been enacted in Part III of the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]].  The changes had been made on the basis of a government consultation document dated 19 July 1994 which the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]] had issued with the title "[[Reform of Architects Registration]]".  The consultation document had set out fourteen proposals for reform, stemming from a request from ARCUK to the Government in 1992 that the Architects Registration Acts should be reviewed; and stated that a report on the review which had been carried out had been published by HMSO in 1993.  The report had been made by Mr E J D Warne, CB, and is commonly known as "The [[Warne Report]]".

The legislation which followed carried the proposed purposes into effect only in part.  In the consultation document the purpose of the reformed body was stated to be: setting criteria for admission to the Register; preventing misuse of the title "[[architect]]"; and the discipline of unprofessional conduct, and the setting of fee levels.  To that end, fourteen proposals had been enumerated.  Some were later abandoned; and others substantially altered, whether in the Bill which was presented to Parliament or in its passage through Parliament, including:
* that the reformed Board would be given statutory authority to make regulations consistent with the provisions of the legislation governing architects registration;
* that the reformed Board would publicise a statement of the criteria for disciplinary offences; and
* that in disciplinary cases, there would be a range of non-monetary penalties, and hearings would be before a small statutory committee composed of both architects and non-architects, with a right to appeal to the full Board.

Proposals mentioned in the consultation document which were later enacted and are now operative were:
* that ARCUK would remain as a legal entity, but, with no impact on its role or status, the name would be changed to "[[Architects Registration Board]]" (ARB);
* that there should be an office of Registrar whose functions would be to maintain the Register and carry out the instructions of the Board;
* that the Board would be made up of 8 lay members appointed by the Government, and 7 architects elected by registered architects; and
* that the [[Board of Architectural Education]] would be abolished, by reason of it being an unwieldy body which would be unnecessary for fulfilling the functions of the reformed Registration Board.

The Table of Derivations, set out at the end of the Act after Schedule 3, by showing the changes which had been made by the 1996 Act to the originating Act of 1931 (as it had by then been amended by the 1938 Act and other legislation), distinguishes them from the provisions which were in the legislation before the 1996 Act, and so were operative in the time of ARCUK and have remained operative from 21 July 1997, when the reconstituting changes took effect.

===Professional Conduct Committee===
One of the changes made was replacing the Discipline Committee of ARCUK with a Professional Conduct Committee under Part III of the Act with statutory powers to inflict fines expressly on a par with criminal penalties. Under the Act, the committee was to be a body having persons who were not themselves members of the profession in the decisive majority and who would not necessarily have the appropriate skill and knowledge to be able to act competently and fairly in respect of hazarding an architect's professional reputation or livelihood; nor would members of the committee be acting under the judicial oath of a judge or a magistrate in a court of criminal or civil jurisdiction, or pursuant to the consensual jurisdiction of an arbitrator. As a safeguard of [[due process]] in accordance with the [[rule of law]] the statutory provisions for constituting the Professional Conduct Committee in Part II of Schedule 1 of the Act (and as later amended) reflect the usual practice for appointing a legally qualified chairman, with appropriate experience, who can be held to have a professional and judicial responsibility for protecting the basic right of any accused person, whose reputation and livelihood could be at stake, to a fair and unprejudiced hearing and trial.

'''Exoneration'''

Under the first section of Part III of the Act &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/22/part/III section 13]&lt;/ref&gt; 
the Board is required to issue a code "laying down standards of professional conduct and practice expected of registered persons",&lt;ref&gt;for current code see ARB website page Architects Code: Standards of Conduct and Practice 2010 Version [http://www.arb.org.uk/professional_standards/regulating_architects/architects_code_2010/code.php]&lt;/ref&gt; but the same section  states explicitly that failure to comply with the provisions of the code shall not be taken of itself to constitute unacceptable professional conduct. In the case of an architect against whom an allegation of unacceptable professional conduct or serious professional incompetence has not been sustained by the Professional Conduct Committee the Act provides for publication of an exonerating statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/22/part/III section 15 (5)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The Table of Derivations also shows that certain definitions which were inserted for the purpose of the consolidation included one to make clear that where there is a reference to "unacceptable professional conduct", it has the same meaning as it has in section 14 (not ''vice versa''): in section 14(1) the phrase is expanded as "conduct which falls short of the standard required of a registered person".

==Interpretation==

===Legislative context of Architects Registration===
Under the legislation, the registration body has been a statutory corporation from its inception, first as a Council of numerous persons nominated mainly by professional bodies under the 1931 Act, and, from July 1997, as a Board of fifteen persons, of which the majority has been appointed by the [[Privy Council]] in the manner prescribed by paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 1 of the Act, that is: 
: ''...after consultation with the Secretary of State and such other persons or bodies as the Privy Council thinks fit, to represent the interests of users of architectural services and the general public'',
Members of the general public clearly have an interest to the extent that the legislation makes it a criminal offence to infringe the restrictions placed upon the freedom of individuals (including qualified architects), and of firms and partnerships, and companies and corporations of all kinds, to use the word "architect".

From the 1880s, it has been a moot point whether the effect of such registration and protection of the title "architect" would be to place an undue burden on the profession for too little benefit for the public, or to confer an unfair advantage on the profession, or one section of it, as against competitors. But in more recent decades the statutory [[Register of Architects]] and the protection of the title "[[architect]]" under the legislation has been affected by the obligation of the Government to secure compliance with obligations in connection with membership of the [[European Union]] and the [[European Economic Area]]. This has brought in its train questions about the criteria and standards for deciding upon [[equivalence of professional qualifications]] in EU and EEA countries, and the legitimate expectations of those who have qualified.

===Accuracy of UK Government information about Architects Registration===
In May 2006 the then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair|(Mr Blair)]] arranged for ministerial responsibility for the Architects Registration Board to be transferred from the then [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] (ODPM) to a newly formed Department which was to be called "[[Department of Communities and Local Government|Communities and Local Government]]" (DCLG) and to be headed by a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] ([[Ruth Kelly]]), to whom the Prime Minister addressed [http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/388681/prime-minister-letter a letter] setting out what was required.  This Department's [http://www.communities.gov.uk/ official website] published the Prime Minister's letter and stated its vision to be of "prosperous and cohesive communities, offering a safe, healthy and sustainable environment for all".

The website also had [http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/buildingregulations/architects/architectsregistration/ a page] for describing the [[Architects Registration Board]] where it offered a summary of the effect of the legislation, but which had a thread of inaccuracy in three out of four sentences, namely:
* stating that ARB "succeeded" ARCUK, when the legislation had expressly stated that it was the same body but with another name as from July 1997 (See above: Continuity of Legislation);
* stating that it was established to guarantee the professional competence of architects to consumers, when there is nothing in the legislation or otherwise giving ARB either the legal powers or the funds to honour any such guarantee; and
* that all architects must be registered by ARB in order to practise legally in the United Kingdom, when under the legislation (see related articles cited below) an architect, or any other person, is free to perform or supply the services of an architect subject only to the restrictions on the use of the vernacular word "[[architect]]" contained in the legislation first enacted by Parliament in the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|1938 Act]].

In European [[architectural sculpture]], an '''atlas''' (also known as an '''atlant''', or '''atlante'''&lt;ref&gt; Hersey, George,  The Lost Meaning of Classical Architecture,  MIT Press, Cambridge, MA,  1998 p. 129 &lt;/ref&gt;  or '''atlantid'''; plural '''atlantes''')&lt;ref name="atlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Aru.html ''Aru-Az'''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704103828/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Aru.html |date=2008-07-04 }}, Michael Delahunt, [http://www.artlex.com/ ArtLex Art Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}, 1996–2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is a support sculpted in the form of a man, which may take the place of a [[column]], a [[Pier (architecture)|pier]] or a [[pilaster]]. The Roman term for such a sculptural support is a telamon (plural '''''telamones''''' or telamons).&lt;ref name="atlex" /&gt;

The term ''atlantes'' is the Greek plural of the name [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]—the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who was forced to hold the sky on his shoulders for eternity. The alternative term, ''telamones'', also is derived from a later mythological hero, [[Telamon]], one of the [[Argonauts]], who was the father of [[Telamonian Aias|Ajax]]. 

The [[caryatid]] is the female precursor of this architectural form in Greece, a woman standing in the place of each column or pillar. Caryatids are found at the treasuries at [[Delphi]] and the [[Erechtheion]] on the Acropolis at Athens for Athene. They usually are in an [[Ionic order|Ionic context]] and represented a ritual association with the goddesses worshiped within.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M., ed., ''Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture'', Dover Publications, New York,  1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Atalante is typically life-size or larger; smaller similar figures in the decorative arts are called [[Term (architecture)|terms]].  The body of many Atalantes turns into a rectangular pillar or other architectural feature around the waist level, a feature borrowed from the term.  The pose and expression of Alalantes very often show their effort to bear the heavy load of the building, which is rarely the case with terms and caryatids.  The [[herma]] or herm is a classical boundary marker or wayside monument to a god which is usually a square pillar with only a carved head on top, about life-size, and male genitals at the appropriate mid-point. Figures that are rightly called Atalantes may sometimes be described as herms.

Atlantes express extreme effort in their function, heads bent forward to support the weight of the structure above them across their shoulders, forearms often lifted to provide additional support, providing an architectural motif.  Atlantes and caryatids were noted by the Roman late Republican architect [[Vitruvius]], whose description of the structures,&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, ''De Architectura'', 6.7.6.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than surviving examples, transmitted the idea of atlantes to the Renaissance architectural vocabulary.

==Origin==
Not only did the Caryatids precede them, but similar architectural figures already had been made in [[ancient Egypt]] out of [[monolith]]s. Atlantes originated in Greek Sicily and in [[Magna Graecia]], southern Italy. The [[:Image:Agrigento Telamon.jpg|earliest surviving atlantes]] are fallen ones from the Early Classical [[Greek temple]] of Zeus, the ''Olympeion'', in [[Agrigento]], Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdiva.blogspot.com/2008/05/vitruvius-caryatids-and-telamones.html Dorothy King, "Doric Figured Supports: Vitruvius’ Caryatids and Atlantes: 5.2 Atlantes and Telamones"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Atlantes, however, have played a more significant role in [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] and [[baroque architecture]]. 

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many buildings were built with glorious atlantes that look much like the Greek ones. Their selection from the two proposed designs&amp;mdash;the other design using Caryatids&amp;mdash;for the entrance of the [[Hermitage Museum]] that was built for Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] made atlantes become even more fashionable. The portico of this building has ten enormous atlantes, approximately three times life-size, carved from [[Sortavala|Serdobol granite]], which were designed by [[Johann Halbig]] and executed by the sculptor, [[Alexander Terebenev]].

==Mesoamerica==
Similar carved stone columns or pillars in the shape of fierce men at some sites of Pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]] are typically called [[Atlantean figures]].  These figures are considered to be "massive statues of [[Toltec]] warriors".&lt;ref name="Evans-p42"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Susan|title=Ancient Mexico and Central America: Archaeology and Culture History|year=2008|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] played an important role in the development of [[Japanese art]] between the 6th and the 16th centuries. [[Buddhist art]] and [[Buddhist]] religious thought came to Japan from [[China]] through [[Korea]] and Buddhist art was encouraged by Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]] in the [[Suiko]] period in the sixth century and by [[Emperor Shōmu]] in the [[Nara period]] in the eighth century. In the early [[Heian period]] Buddhist art and architecture greatly influenced the traditional [[Shinto]] arts, and Buddhist painting became fashionable among wealthy Japanese. The Kamakura period saw a flowering of Japanese Buddhist sculpture, whose origins are in the works of Heian period sculptor [[Jōchō]]. &lt;!--Many of the great artists from [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara]] during the [[Kamakura period]] were also [[Buddhist monks]].
--&gt;
The [[Amitabha|Amida]] sect of Buddhism provided the basis for many popular artworks. Buddhist art became popular among the masses via [[Emakimono|scroll paintings]], paintings used in worship and paintings of [[Buddhas]], [[saint]]'s lives, [[hell]]s and other religious themes. Under the [[Zen]] sect of Buddhism, portraiture of priests such as Bodhidharma became popular as well as scroll calligraphy and sumi-e brush painting.

==Asuka and Nara periods==

[[File:Shakyamuni Triad Horyuji.JPG|thumb|Shakyamuni Triad by Tori Busshi depicts the Buddha Shakyamuni in the traditional sixth-century Chinese style with an elongated head and in front of a flaming mandorla - a lotus petal shaped cloud.]]

Buddhist art was introduced to Japan along with the Buddhist religion in the mid-sixth century, when according to tradition, [[Seong of Baekje]] sent a statue of the Buddha along with some sutras to the [[Emperor Kinmei]]. The [[Asuka period]] (552–645) saw the gradual growth of Chinese and Korean artistic and religious influences on Japanese culture. Chinese influence grew in the Nara Period (645–784) as the Japanese court began to model itself in a Chinese form, and Buddhism continued to spread throughout Japan, while integrating within it the Japanese religion of Shinto. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 211.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture of this period shows, as do most all subsequent sculpture, the influence of continental art. [[Tori Busshi]] a descendant of a Chinese immigrant followed the style of [[Northern Wei]] sculpture and established what has come to be known as the Tori school of sculpture. Notable examples of Tori works are the Sakyamuni Triad (or Shaka triad) which are the main icons of the Golden Hall of [[Hōryū-ji]] temple and the [[kannon]] [[Boddhisatva]] of Yumedono Hall of the same temple, also known as Guze Kannon. First built in the early 7th century as the private temple of Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]], [[Hōryū-ji]] consists of 41 independent buildings. The most important ones, the main worship hall, or ''Kondō'' (Golden Hall), and ''Gojū-no-tō'' (Five-story [[Pagoda]]), stand in the center of an open area surrounded by a roofed cloister. Inside the ''Kondō'', on a large rectangular platform, are some of the most important sculptures of the period including the Sakyamuni triad.

In the Sakyamuni Triad, [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni]], the center Buddha, is attended by two other figures, [[Bhaisajyaguru]] to its right and [[Amitabha|Amitābha]] to its left. The statues are dated to 623.&lt;ref name="ISBN477002939X"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN477002939X&amp;id=zMC4RMXQkn0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;vq=kannon&amp;dq=chuguji+miroku&amp;sig=Z5IBZpP5m89CZxi3XUnwfbEBsh4|title=Discovering the Arts of Japan: A Historical Overview, p42|accessdate=2007-04-03|publisher=Kodansha International|year=2003|author=Tsuneko S.

The Early Nara period saw a move towards more naturalistic styles emerging from China. The Triad of Yakushi shows the healing Buddha which presides over the Eastern Pure Land attended by two Bodhisattvas Nikko and Gakko. The triad, housed in the Yakushiji temple (7th century in Nara), reveals Chinese and central Asian influences in its anatomical definition, naturalism and realistic drapery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 212.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sculpture also demonstrates the roots of Japanese art in the 1st-3rd century CE [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], characterized by flowing dress patterns and realistic rendering,&lt;ref&gt;"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style" (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p19)&lt;/ref&gt; on which Chinese and Korean artistic traits were superimposed. After the [[Northern Wei|Chinese Northern Wei]] buddhist art had infiltrated a Korean peninsula, Buddhist icons was brought Japan by Korean immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Influence on Early Japanese Buddhist Sculpture [http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000593748&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002169717&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;menu_cd=0000008845&amp;menu_code=&amp;image_folder=color_11&amp;bg_color=2B5137&amp;line_color=3A6A4A&amp;menu_type= buddhapia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111194158/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000593748&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002169717&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;menu_cd=0000008845&amp;menu_code=&amp;image_folder=color_11&amp;bg_color=2B5137&amp;line_color=3A6A4A&amp;menu_type= |date=2011-01-11 }} "One must stress the obvious point that since Korean Buddhist art is directly based on developments in China, ultimately a study of Korean influence on Japan must be rooted in an understanding of the Chinese impact on Korea.""Since the territory of the Northern Wei was adjacent to that of Koguryo, it is natural that the Buddhist ideas and art current at the Northern Wei court would flow directly to Koguryo. ""It should also be pointed out that there was considerable influence from Koguryo on the southern kingdoms of Paekche and Silla even though Paekche also received direct influence from south China, as was mentioned above.""I have argued that various groups, including official envoys, monks and students, as well as Korean settlers, were responsible for bringing Korean icons to Japan."&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Ancient Greek art style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the [[Kōryū-ji]] [[Maitreya|Miroku]] Bosatsu and the [[Chūgū-ji]] [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] statues.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Three Kingdoms of Korea, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN070071605X&amp;id=e1BzL2lwPqEC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=korean+buddhist+art&amp;sig=4XlpYzvL4PF3TKAR7BO3ZwFBXbg]&lt;/ref&gt;
They illustrate the terminal point of the [[Silk Road transmission of art]] during the first few centuries of our era. Other examples can be found in the development of the iconography of the Japanese [[Fūjin]] Wind God,&lt;ref&gt;"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins.&amp;nbsp;... One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p21)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Niō]] guardians,&lt;ref&gt;"The origin of the image of [[Vajrapani]] should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modeled after that of Hercules.&amp;nbsp;... The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterward transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities (Niō)." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)&lt;/ref&gt; and the near-[[classical antiquity|Classical]] floral patterns in temple decorations.&lt;ref&gt;The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple building in the 8th century was focused around the [[Tōdai-ji]] in Nara. Constructed as the headquarters for a network of temples in each of the provinces, the Tōdaiji is the most ambitious religious complex erected in the early centuries of Buddhist worship in Japan. Appropriately, the 16.2&amp;nbsp;m (53&amp;nbsp;ft) Buddha (completed 752) enshrined in the main Buddha hall, or ''Daibutsuden'', is a [[Rushana]] Buddha, the figure that represents the essence of Buddhahood, just as the Tōdaiji represented the center for Imperially sponsored Buddhism and its dissemination throughout Japan. Only a few fragments of the original statue survive, and the present hall and central Buddha are reconstructions from the [[Edo period]].

Under the [[Ritsuryō]] system of government in the [[Nara period]], Buddhism was heavily regulated by the state through the {{nihongo|Sōgō|僧綱||''Office of Priestly Affairs''}}.  During this time, Tōdai-ji served as the central administrative temple for the provincial temples&lt;ref name="abe"&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6 | pages=35, 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Buddhism in Japan#Nara Period|six Buddhist schools in Japan]] at the time.

==[[Heian period]] (794–1185)==
[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|right|Taizokai (Womb World) mandala, second half of ninth century. Hanging scroll, color on silk. The center square represents the young stage of [[Vairocana]] Buddha.]]

In 784, the [[Emperor Kanmu]] threatened by the growing secular power of the Buddhist institutions in Nara moved the capital to [[Heian-kyō]] (Kyōto), which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2007 p.32&lt;/ref&gt; The term Heian period refers to the years between 794 and 1185, when the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was established at the end of the [[Genpei War]]. The period is further divided into the early Heian and the late Heian, or Fujiwara era, the pivotal date being 894, the year imperial embassies to China were officially discontinued.

[[Buddhism]] began to spread throughout Japan during the Heian period, primarily through two major esoteric sects, [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]]. Tendai originated in [[China]] and is based on the [[Lotus Sutra]], one of the most important [[sutra]]s of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism; [[Saichō]] was key to its transmission to Japan. [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] (true word school) is an indigenous sect with close affiliations to Chinese influenced Buddhist thought founded by [[Kūkai]] (best known by his posthumous title Kōbō Daishi, 774–835) who traveled to China and studied Indian and Chinese Buddhism, as well as Chinese calligraphy and poetry. Emperor Kanmu himself was a notable patron of the [[Tendai]] sect, which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries. Kūkai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded [[Emperor Kanmu]], and also generations of Japanese, not only with his holiness but also with his poetry, calligraphy, painting, and sculpture. Shingon Buddhist practice is based on various rituals, including the chanting of [[mantras]], [[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]], hand gestures ([[mudras]]) and meditation through visualization of [[mandala]]s. The central role of ritual in Japanese esoteric Buddhism led to a flourishing of the religious arts in the Heian period. These religious paintings, mandalas and statues provided practitioners with a way to contemplate on Buddhist deities and concepts. A famous example of Shingon Mandala is the Taizokai (Womb World) mandala. Part of the [[Mandala of the Two Realms]], the womb world is composed of 12 zones representing different dimensions of Buddha nature.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p215"&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 215.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the center sits the [[Vairocana]] Buddha within the lotus of compassion surrounded by attendant Buddhas and [[Bodhisattva]]s. The Shingon sect believed that all beings have an innate Buddha nature.
&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p215"/&gt;

The temples erected for the Shingon sect such as that at [[Mt. Kōya]] were built in the Kii mountains, far away from the Court and the laity in the capital. The irregular topography of these sites forced Japanese architects to rethink the problems of temple construction, and in so doing to choose more indigenous elements of design. Cypress-bark roofs replaced those of ceramic tile, wood planks were used instead of earthen floors, and a separate worship area for the laity was added in front of the main sanctuary. The temple that best reflects the spirit of early Heian Shingon temples is the Murō-ji (early 9th century), set deep in a stand of cypress trees on a mountain southeast of Nara.

[[File:Byodoin Wall Painting JYOHIN-CHUSEI South.JPG|right|thumb|upright| Wall Painting on South door of Byōdō-in]]

In the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara period]], [[Pure Land|Pure Land Buddhism]], which offered easy salvation through belief in [[Amitabha|Amida]] (the Buddha of the Western Paradise), became popular. This period is named after the [[Fujiwara clan]], then the most powerful in the country, who ruled as [[Sesshō and Kampaku|regents]] for the Emperor, becoming, in effect, civil dictators. Concurrently, the Kyoto nobility developed a society devoted to elegant aesthetic pursuits. 
The ''Hō-ō-dō'' (Phoenix Hall, completed 1053) of the [[Byōdō-in]], a temple in [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] to the southeast of Kyoto, is the exemplar of Fujiwara Amida halls. It consists of a main rectangular structure flanked by two L-shaped wing corridors and a tail corridor, set at the edge of a large artificial pond. Inside, a single golden image of Amida (c. 1053) is installed on a high platform. The Amida sculpture was executed by [[Jōchō]], who popularized the Chinese technique of creating a work from several smaller pieces of sculpted wood (''[[yosegi]]''). Although it limited the amount of surface detail the artist could carve into each piece, the method forced the sculptor to convey his intended message within these limits. This resulted in more refined and ephemeral-looking pieces.&lt;ref name="Paine-p93"&gt;Paine 93.&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, it allowed several assistants to work on the sculpture at once, greatly speeding the process.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163"&gt;Noma 163.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jōchō]], as the master, did the finishing work.&lt;ref name="Mason-p144"&gt;Mason 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The technique also led to systematized [[Body proportions|proportion]]s of body parts and simple surface details, as these sped the creation of the constituent parts and the formation of the finished piece.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163" /&gt;

Art historians often cite this new [[canon (art)|canon]] of proportions as evidence of Jōchō's genius. He based the measurements on a unit equal to the distance between the sculpted figure's chin and hairline. The distance between each knee is equal to the distance from the bottoms of the legs to the hair.&lt;ref name="Mason-p144" /&gt; The widely spaced and level knees thus form the base of a triangular design, conveying a feeling of stability and peace. The effect is further accentuated by the contrast of other elements in the design, particularly the figures' [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]s. These are intricately detailed, featuring dancing [[tennin]], clouds, and flames.&lt;ref name="Paine-p93" /&gt; Jōchō's sculptures' expressions convey compassion and elegance, and the detailed and precise carving of the facial features projects a certain kindness.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163" /&gt;

The workshop method of dividing work among several craftsmen caught on, as did Jōchō's style. His school was imitated by sculptors across Japan for the over next 150 years, as Japanese sculpture devolved into a conformist orthodoxy before being reinvented in the Kamakura period.&lt;ref&gt;Shively and McCullogh 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rising importance of Pure Land sects of Japanese Buddhism in the tenth century, new image-types were developed to satisfy the devotional needs of these sects. These include Raigozu (来迎図), which depict Amida Buddha along with attendant Bodhisattvas Kannon and Seishi arriving to welcome the souls of the faithful departed to Amida's Western Paradise. A noted early example dating from 1053 are painted on the interior of the Phoenix Hall of the Byōdō-in, a temple in Uji, Kyoto. This is also considered an early example of so-called [[Yamato-e]] (大和絵), or "Japanese-style painting", insofar as it includes landscape elements such as soft rolling hills that seem to reflect something of the actual appearance of the landscape of western Japan. Stylistically, however, this type of painting continues to be informed by Tang Dynasty Chinese "blue and green style" landscape painting traditions. "Yamato-e" is an imprecise term that continues to be debated among historians of Japanese art.

Japan suffered a series of civil wars in the late 12th century between several rival families, which eventually led to the rise of the feudalistic [[Kamakura shogunate]], so named because the victorious family, the [[Minamoto clan]], established their political base in Kamakura. The Emperor remained in Kyoto as a figurehead but the actual political power rested with the ''[[shōgun]]''. The Kamakura period saw the reestablishment of cultural ties with China, as well as the growth of [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Pure Land Buddhism]] as the two major branches of Japanese Buddhism.

These new Kamakura patrons also favored a more realistic and naturalistic art which is exemplified by the sculpture of the [[Kei school]]. The Kei school developed out of that led by the ''[[busshi]]'' (Buddhist sculptor) [[Jōchō]], his successor [[Kakujō]], and Kakujō's son [[Raijō]], the leading sculptors of the preceding generations. These artists are sometimes said to have founded the Kei school;&lt;ref name=jaanus&gt;"[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/keiha.htm Keiha]." ''Japanese Architecture and Art Users System (JAANUS).'' 2001. Accessed 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the school would not come into its own, and become associated with the name "Kei" until Raijō was succeeded by [[Kōkei (sculptor)|Kōkei]] and [[Unkei]] around the year 1200.

Among sculptors of the [[Kei school]], [[Unkei]] is the most famous and considered to be the most accomplished sculptor of the period.&lt;ref name="Varley 94"&gt;Varley 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his works, a pair of large [[Nio]] (or Kongō Rikishi) in Tōdai-ji depict muscular guardians in a dramatic [[contrapposto]] stance.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Unkei's sculptures of Indian priests Mujaku and Seshin in [[Kōfuku-ji]] demonstrate a new portrait-like realism.&lt;ref&gt;Noma 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Both statues sport priestly vestments that frame their bodies realistically. They stand life-size and alone and are fully sculpted in the round as if intended to be viewed from any angle. Mujaku is depicted as a thin man manipulating some sort of holy, cloth-wrapped object. He appears reserved and reflective. Seshin, in contrast, is depicted in mid conversation, gesturing and speaking, an extroverted counterweight to the solemn Mujaku.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The men are shown as specific people, not simply members of a stock type.&lt;ref name="Paine 112"&gt;Paine 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unkei]] had six sculptor sons and their work is also imbued with the new humanism. Tankei, the eldest son and a brilliant sculptor became the head of the studio. [[Kōshō]], the 4th son produced a remarkable sculpture of the 10th-century Japanese Buddhist teacher Kuya (903–972). [[Kaikei]] was a collaborator of [[Unkei]] and worked with him on the [[Nio]] statues in 1203. He worked with priest Chogen (1121–1206): the director of Tōdai-ji reconstruction project. Many of his figures are more idealized than Unkei and his sons, and are characterized by a beautifully finished surface, richly decorated with pigments and gold. His works have survived more than 40, many of which are signed by himself.

Much of the cities of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and [[Kyoto]] were destroyed in the [[Genpei War]] of 1180–1185. The [[Kei school]] was granted the opportunity to restore Nara's greatest temples, the [[Tōdai-ji]] and [[Kōfuku-ji]], replacing their Buddhist sculptures. The leading figure in this effort was Shunjobo Chogen (1121–1206), who was known to have made three trips to China to study sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner.

Tuttle Company, 1957. p98.&lt;/ref&gt; and drew extensively on [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] Chinese styles, introducing new stylistic elements while remaining true to tradition.

Some of the most popular paintings of the Kamakura period depict an ascending Amida Buddha. The main tenet of Pure Land Buddhism is that chanting the name of Amida could lead to a reincarnation in the pure land. Thus, scrolls of Amida would be hung in the room of the dying who would be saved by chanting the Amida mantra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 220.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Kamakura period new Buddhists sects, such as Kegon and Nichiren emerged and grew in popularity. These sects produced several distinct genres of painting, including the [[Suijako]] paintings, which tried to reconcile the two main Japanese faiths by depicting Shinto deities as early manifestations of Buddha. Works like the Kegon Engi Emaki, a book illustrated to help people understand complicated Chinese character, became more popular with ordinary people. Emakimono, or long illustrated hand scrolls, also served to illustrate the life of the Buddha and the history of key Buddhist leaders.

==[[Muromachi period]] (1333–1573)==

[[File:Sesshu - Haboku-Sansui.jpg|thumb|upright|{{Nihongo|''Splashed-ink Landscape''|破墨山水|''[[Haboku sansui]]''}}, [[Sesshū]], 1495, ink on silk, 148.6 × 32.7 cm]]

During the [[Muromachi period]], also called the Ashikaga period, a profound change took place in Japanese culture. The [[Ashikaga clan]] took control of the shogunate and moved its headquarters back to Kyoto, to the Muromachi district of the city. With the return of government to the capital, the popularizing trends of the Kamakura period came to an end, and cultural expression took on a more aristocratic, elitist character. During the Muromachi Period, [[Zen Buddhism]] rose to prominence especially among the elite [[Samurai]] class, who embraced the Zen values of personal discipline, concentration and self-development. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 736.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the great Zen monasteries in Kamakura and Kyoto had a major impact on the visual arts. Because of secular ventures and trading missions to China organized by Zen temples, many Chinese paintings and objects of art were imported into Japan and profoundly influenced Japanese artists working for Zen temples and the shogunate. Not only did these imports change the subject matter of painting, but they also modified the use of color; the bright colors of [[Yamato-e]] yielded to the monochromes of painting in the Chinese manner of Sui-boku-ga (水墨画) or [[sumi-e]] (墨絵), this style mainly used only black ink — the same as used in East Asian calligraphy.

[[File:Shubun - Reading in a Bamboo Grove detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of "Reading in a Bamboo Grove", 1446, [[Shūbun]]]]

The foremost painter of the new [[Sumi-e]] style was [[Sesshū Tōyō]] (1420–1506), a [[Rinzai]] priest who traveled to China in 1468–69 and studied contemporary Ming painting. Some of his most dramatic works are in the Chinese splashed-ink (Haboku) style.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p737"&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 737.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Japan, Sesshū built himself a studio and established a large following, painters that are now referred to as the Unkoku-rin school or "School of Sesshū". To make one of the calligraphic and highly stylized Haboku paintings, the painter would visualize the image and then made swift broad strokes into the paper resulting in a splashed and abstract composition, all done with meditative concentration. This impressionistic style of painting was supposed to capture the true nature of the subject. The [[Sumi-e]] style was highly influenced by calligraphy, using the same tools and style as well as its zen philosophy.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p737"/&gt; To paint in this style the practitioner had to clear his mind and apply the brush strokes without too much thinking, termed {{nihongo|''[[mushin (mental state)|mushin]]''|無心|"no mind state"}} by the Japanese philosopher [[Nishida Kitaro]].&lt;ref name="yuko"&gt;{{cite web |title=Shodo History |url=http://www.zenshodo.com/history.htm |author=Solana Yuko Halada |work=Japanese Calligraphy in Zen Spirit |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102204715/http://www.zenshodo.com/history.htm |archivedate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[mushin (mental state)|mushin]] is central to many Japanese arts including the art of the sword, archery and the tea ceremony.

By the end of the 14th century, monochrome landscape paintings (sansuiga) had found patronage by the ruling Ashikaga family and was the preferred genre among Zen painters, gradually evolving from its Chinese roots to a more Japanese style. Another important painter in this period is [[Tenshō Shūbun]], a monk at the Kyoto temple of [[Shōkoku-ji]] who traveled to Korea and studied under Chinese painters. He returned to Japan in 1404 and settled in Kyoto, then the capital city. He became director of the court painting bureau, established by Ashikaga shoguns, who were influential art patrons. Shūbun's most well-known landscape painting, designated as a National Treasure in Japan, is Reading in a Bamboo Grove, now kept in the Tokyo National Museum.

[[File:Hyônen zu by Josetsu.jpg|thumb|170px|Hyōnen-zu (瓢鮎図), ink on paper, 111.5 × 75.8 cm, Myōshin-ji temple, Taizō-in, Kyoto.]]

Another style which developed in the Muromachi period is [[Shigajiku]] (詩画軸). This is usually a painting accompanied by poetry and has its roots in China, where painting and poetry were seen as inherently connected. This style grew out of literary circles, an artist would usually be given a subject to paint and the poets would write accompanying verses to be written above the work. A famous example is the scroll "Catching a Catfish with a Gourd" (Hyōnen-zu 瓢鮎図) located at [[Taizō-in]], [[Myōshin-ji]], Kyoto. Created by the priest-painter [[Josetsu]] ({{circa|1386}} – {{circa|1428}}), it includes 31 verses of many Zen priests inscribed above the painting. 
&lt;ref name="yuko-2"&gt;{{cite web |title = JAANUS Japanese architecture and art net users system |url =http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/shigajiku.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreground of the painting a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background, mountains appear to be far in the distance. The painting was commissioned by the 4th Shogun of the Muromachi Period, Ashikaga Yoshimochi (1386-1428) and was based on the nonsensical riddle "How do you catch a catfish with a gourd?". An example of one of the Koans illustrates the style of the poetry inscribed above the painting.

&lt;poem&gt;:::Poised! With the Gourd
:::He tries to pin that slippery fish.
:::Some oil on the gourd
:::Would add zest to the chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Circa 1492: art in the age of exploration, 1991, Jay A. Levenson. P 321–22.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:::::::::::(Shusu [1423] Trans. Matsushita, 1974)&lt;/poem&gt;

The painting and accompanying poems capture both the playfulness and the perplexing nature of Zen buddhist ''[[kōans]]'' which was supposed to aid the Zen practitioner in his meditation and was a central practice of the [[Rinzai]] school.

In the late Muromachi period, ink painting had migrated out of the Zen monasteries into the art world in general, as artists from the Kano school and the Ami school adopted the style and themes, but introducing a more plastic and decorative effect that would continue into modern times.

==[[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] (1573–1603)==
[[File:Hasegawa Tohaku - Pine Trees (Shōrin-zu byōbu) - left hand screen.jpg|thumb|250px|Left panel of the {{nihongo|''Pine Trees screen''|[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]|松林図 屏風}} by [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], c.1595]]

This period saw the rise of the [[Kanō school]] (狩野派 Kanō-ha?) which is one of the most famous schools of Japanese painting. The Kanō school of painting was the dominant style of painting until the Meiji period. It was founded by Kanō Masanobu (1434–1530), a contemporary of Sesshū and student of Shūbun who became an official painter in the Shogun's court. The artists who followed him including his son improved upon his style and methods. His son, [[Kanō Motonobu]] (1476–1559) established the Kano style as the main Japanese painting school during the Muromachi period.

In sharp contrast to the previous Muromachi period, the Azuchi Momoyama period was characterized by a grandiose polychrome style, with extensive use of [[gold]] and [[silver]] foil, and by works on a very large scale. [[Kanō school]] painters were patronized by [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and their followers. [[Kanō Eitoku]] developed a formula for the creation of monumental landscapes on the sliding doors enclosing a room. These huge screens and wall paintings were commissioned to decorate the castles and palaces of the military nobility. This status continued into the subsequent Edo period, as the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] continued to promote the works of the Kanō school as the officially sanctioned art for the ''[[shōgun]]'', ''[[daimyō]]s'', and [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial court]]. The rise of the Kanō school saw a beginning of a move away from buddhist themes, as Kano school patrons commissioned paintings of a more secular nature to decorate their palaces.

However some painters in this period continued to look back to the Buddhist priest-painters which had initially influenced the Kano school. One of these painters was [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], who was influenced by the monochrome ink paintings of the Muromachi painter [[Sesshū]] and developed his own style of [[Sumi-e]] which looked back to the minimalism of its predecessors. Tōhaku was in fact so much enamored with the techniques of [[Sesshū Tōyō]] that he attempted to claim rights as his fifth successor, though he lost in a court battle to [[Unkoku Togan]].&lt;ref name="HASEGAWA"&gt;[http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/mibu/eng/pages/artworks/paintings/tohaku.html HASEGAWA Tohaku (1539–1610)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208192923/http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/mibu/eng/pages/artworks/paintings/tohaku.html |date=2009-12-08 }} Mibura-Dera Temple Website. 10 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the influence of Sesshū is evident in many of Tōhaku's mid to late works, such as his famous {{nihongo|''[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]''|松林図 屏風|extra2=Pine Trees screen}}, which were declared a [[National Treasures of Japan|national treasure of Japan]] are argued to be the first paintings of their scale to depict only pine trees as subject matter.&lt;ref name="HASEGAWA"/&gt;

The school founded by Hasegawa Tōhaku is known today as the [[Hasegawa school]]. This school was small, consisting mostly of Tōhaku and his sons. However small, its members conserved Tōhaku's quiet and reserved aesthetic, which many attribute to the influence of [[Sesshū]] as well as his contemporary and friend, [[Sen no Rikyū]]. It is suspected that these simple aesthetics protest the usage of intimidation and wealth rampant in the [[Kanō school]].&lt;ref&gt;Moes, Robert D.. "The Other Side of Tōhaku".

===Zen art===
Under the Zen sect of Buddhism, which became very popular in Japan in the 14th and 15th centuries, portraits of Zen priests were often produced. Zen was a sect of Buddhism which promoted simplicity and less involved in worship, so religious paintings were not needed for this reason. Instead, Zen priests often painted images of teachers and Zen masters. Unlike in the earlier Heian period, where it had been considered "rude in Heian times to copy a person's likeness"{{attribution needed|date=January 2018}} (Stanley-Baker 2000, 115), the Zen portraits were close-up portraits showing facial features and details. A portrait of [[Zen Teacher/Zen Master|Zen master]] Muso Kokushi painted by his student Muto Shui, shows a detailed portrait of the face, with the whole picture being only a head and shoulders portrait. This is unlike earlier Japanese painting which would depict people as much smaller figures. Zen priests also painted landscapes, such as the [[Ink and wash painting|suiboku-ga]], or water and black ink painting, which was inspired by Zen doctrine.

==Architecture==
Buddhism exerted tremendous influence on [[Japanese art]] in a variety of ways and through many periods of Japanese history. [[Buddhist temples]] with their halls and five-story towers were built all over Japan, and huge sculptures of Buddha were made for these temples.

'''Carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand''' or '''CBOD''' is a method defined test measured by the depletion of dissolved oxygen by biological organisms in a body of water in which the contribution from nitrogenous bacteria has been suppressed. CBOD is a method defined parameter is widely used as an indication of the pollutant removal from [[wastewater]]. It is listed as a conventional pollutant in the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]].

== The CBOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; test ==

The CBOD tests have the widest application in measuring waste loadings to treatment plants and in evaluating the CBOD-removal efficiency of such treatment systems. The test measures the molecular oxygen utilized during a specified incubation period for the biochemical degradation of organic material (carbonaceous demand) and the oxygen used to oxidize inorganic material such as sulfides and ferrous iron. It also may measure the amount of oxygen used to oxidize reduced forms of nitrogen (nitrogenous demand) unless their oxidation is prevented by an inhibitor. The seeding and dilution procedures provide an estimate of the CBOD at pH 6.5 to 7.5.

There are two recognized EPA methods for the measurement of CBOD:

== Dissolved oxygen probes: Membrane and luminescence ==

Since the publication of a simple, accurate and direct dissolved oxygen analytical procedure by Winkler,&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, L. W. (1888). "Die zur Bestimmung des in Wasser gelösten Sauerstoffes " Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft 21(2): 2843-2854.&lt;/ref&gt; the analysis of dissolved oxygen levels for water has been key to the determination of surface water purity and ecological wellness. The Winkler method is still one of only two analytical techniques used to calibrate oxygen electrode meters; the other procedure is based on oxygen solubility at saturation as per [[Henry's law]]. Though many researchers have refined the Winkler analysis to dissolved oxygen levels in the low PPB range, the method does not lend itself to automation.

The development of an analytical instrument that utilizes the reduction-oxidation (redox) chemistry of oxygen in the presence of dissimilar metal electrodes was introduced during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kemula, W. and S. Siekierski (1950). "Polarometric determination of oxygen." Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 15: 1069-75.&lt;/ref&gt; This redox electrode utilized an oxygen-permeable membrane to allow the diffusion of the gas into an electrochemical cell and its concentration determined by polarographic or galvanic electrodes. This analytical method is sensitive and accurate down to levels of ± 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/l dissolved oxygen. Calibration of the redox electrode of this membrane electrode still requires the use of the Henry’s law table or the [[Winkler test for dissolved oxygen]].

During the last two decades,{{When|date=May 2013}} a new form of electrode was developed based on the luminescence emission of a photo-active chemical compound and the quenching of that emission by oxygen. This quenching photophysics mechanism is described by the Stern–Volmer equation for dissolved oxygen in a solution:&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Fresnadillo, D., M. D. Marazuela, et al. (1999). "Luminescent Nafion Membranes Dyed with Ruthenium(II) Complexes as Sensing Materials for Dissolved Oxygen." Langmuir 15(19): 6451-6459.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math chem&gt;I_0/I~=~1~+~K_{SV}~[\ce{O2}]&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;: Luminescence in the presence of oxygen
* &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt;: Luminescence in the absence of oxygen
* &lt;math&gt;K_{SV}&lt;/math&gt;: Stern-Volmer constant for oxygen quenching
* &lt;chem&gt;[O2]&lt;/chem&gt;: Dissolved oxygen concentration

The determination of oxygen concentration by luminescence quenching has a linear response over a broad range of oxygen concentrations and has excellent accuracy and reproducibility.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, J., H. Walter, et al. (2008). "Evaluation of a new optical sensor for measuring dissolved oxygen by comparison with standard analytical methods." Monatsschr. Brauwiss.(Mar./Apr.): 66-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bring the sample to ambient room temperature. If pH of sample is &lt;6.5 or &gt;7.5 neutralize the sample to approximately a pH of 7.0 using either sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide. Aliquots of the neutralized sample are transferred to 300 mL CBOD bottles. These CBOD samples must be at concentrations that will deplete by at least 2&amp;nbsp;mg/L dissolved oxygen (DO) and have at least 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L DO left after five days of incubation. Therefore, make enough dilutions (minimum of 3) of the prepared sample to bracket the predicted CBOD.

The minimum aliquot volume transferred to a 300 mL CBOD bottle will be 3 mL as set by Standard Methods. If a smaller volume is needed to meet the DO depletion requirements, then you must make dilutions to the sample.  Add approximately 0.1 g of Nitrification Inhibitor (2-chloro-6-(trichloro-methyl) pyridine) to each 300mL CBOD bottle before adding CBOD dilution water. If the sample is being prepared as a seeded sample, add enough prepared seed to the sample to achieve acceptable dissolved oxygen depletion. Add CBOD Dilution water to each CBOD sample bottle so as to completely fill the bottle with no air spaces or bubbles when the stopper is placed in the bottle.

Place the dissolved oxygen probe in the bottle and allow the dissolved oxygen meter to come to equilibrium. Allow the meter to come to equilibrium prior to accepting dissolved oxygen value. Record the DO of the sample, stopper the bottle, add DI water to the water seal if needed, cap the water seal, and incubate for 5 days at 20&amp;nbsp;°C ± 1&amp;nbsp;°C. Exclude light to avoid growth of algae in the bottles during incubation.

Upon completion of the 5-day incubation± 6 hours, record the DO of the depleted samples with a calibrated DO meter. Allow the meter to come to equilibrium prior to accepting dissolved oxygen value. Calculate the CBODs from the formula below. Only bottles, including seed controls, giving a minimum DO depletion of 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L and a residual DO of at least 1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L after 5 days of incubation are considered to produce valid data, because at least 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg oxygen uptake per L is required to give a meaningful measure of oxygen uptake and at least 1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L must remain throughout the test to ensure that insufficient DO does not affect the rate of oxidation of waste constituents.

== Bacterial seed CBOD correction ==

Seed CBOD Uptake: Typically a 10, 20, and 30 mL sample of seed added to 3 separate CBOD bottles with approximately 0.1 g Nitrification Inhibitor and diluted with CBOD dilution water. Run these QC samples with each batch of seeded CBOD. Calculate the DO uptake per mL of seed added to each bottle using either the slope method or the ratio method.

For the slope method, plot DO depletion in milligrams per liter versus mLs of seed for all seed control bottles having a 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L depletion and 1.0 minimum residual DO. The plot should present a straight line for which the slope indicates DO depletion per mL of seed. The DO-axis intercept is oxygen depletion caused by the dilution water and should be less than 0.20&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

For the ratio method, divide the DO depletion by the volume of seed in mLs for each seed control bottle having a 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L depletion and greater than 1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L minimum residual DO and average the results.

== CBOD seed ==

The CBOD test is method defined. Factors such as bacterial seed viability, anoxic stress during the 5 days, and nitrogenous inhibition efficacy will produce method variability between duplicates, analysts and laboratories. Clear quality assurance and quality control limits must be developed to produce valid results.

== Sample toxicity ==

Wastewater by definition may contain pollutants that inhibit bacterial seed metabolisms or are toxic to the seed. In these cases, all samples should be seeded with a known amount of viable bacteria for the MBOD analysis. Toxicity or inhibition is observed in CBOD analysis when the calculated CBOD increases with progressive dilutions of the sample.

== Appropriate microbial population ==

Selection of a viable microbial population for the CBOD analysis is key in obtaining valid results. The bacterial population needs both carbonaceous and nitrogenous strains present. Sources of viable bacterial seed can be primary clarifier effluent, non-disinfected secondary clarifier effluent or a commercial seed preparation. Each source should have clear quality assurance and quality control requirements set by the glucose-glutamic acid check sample.

== Glucose-glutamic acid check sample ==

Transfer a known amount of glucose-glutamic acid solution to a CBOD bottle and add sufficient seed to achieve acceptable dissolved oxygen depletion. Fill CBOD bottle with CBOD dilution water and nitrification inhibitor. Determine the 5 Day CBOD. Passing results will have a CBOD of 198 (+ 30.5) mg/L. Run these check samples with each batch of CBOD samples. It is important to realize that glucose-glutamic acid is not intended to be an accuracy check in the test.  Its sole purpose is to demonstrate that the seed is viable and metabolizing in the proper range of activity under the conditions of the test.

== Regulatory use ==

In order to reduce a wastewater plants BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; values to meet regulatory compliance requirements, some plant operators try to suppress [[nitrification]] when they are not required to meet ammonia limits. This practice usually results in increased effluent toxicity and oxygen demand on the receiving waters. Therefore, to eliminate this situation and because the BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; test is not reflective of effluent quality under nitrifying conditions, the wastewater plant should:

# Perform parallel CBOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; tests to indicate whether there is a problem with BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; compliance due to nitrification in the BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; test results and that the CBOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is not directly correlated with the BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; test results, and
# Baseline wastewater plant influent and effluent ammonia, nitrite and nitrate data (same frequency and duration as the parallel CBOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; data) have been provided to perform mass balances for nitrification inhibition. 
The results of these analysis can show that CBOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; should be utilized for regulatory compliance with wastewater discharge requirements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5719">In [[computer science]], the '''cell-probe model''' is a model of computation similar to the [[Random-access machine]], except that all operations are free except memory access.  This model is useful for proving lower bounds of algorithms for data structure problems.

== Overview ==
The cell-probe model is a minor modification of the [[Random-access machine]] model, itself a minor modification of the [[Counter machine]] [[Counter-machine model|model]], in which computational cost is only assigned to accessing units of memory called cells.

In this model, computation is framed as a problem of querying a set of memory cells.  The problem has two phases: the preprocessing phase and the query phase.  The input to the first phase, the preprocessing phase, is a set of data from which to build some structure from memory cells.  The input to the second phase, the query phase, is a query datum.  The problem is to determine if the query datum was included in the original input data set.  Operations are free except to access memory cells.

This model is useful in the analysis of data structures.  In particular, the model clearly shows a minimum number of memory accesses to solve a problem in which there is stored data on which we would like to run some query.  An example of such a problem is the dynamic [[partial sum]] problem.&lt;ref name="patrascu2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pătraşcu|first=Mihai|author2=Demaine, Erik D. |title=Logarithmic lower bounds in the cell-probe model|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|date=2006|volume=35|issue=4|pages=932–963|bibcode=2005cs........2041P|arxiv=cs/0502041|doi=10.1137/s0097539705447256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patrascu_morin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pătraşcu|first=Mihai|title=Lower Bounds for Dynamic Partial Sums|url=http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~morin/teaching/5408/refs/p09.pdf|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In [[Andrew Yao]]'s 1981 paper "Should Tables Be Sorted?",&lt;ref name="yao81"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yao|first=Andrew Chi-Chih|title=Should Tables Be Sorted?|journal=J. ACM|date=July 1981|volume=28|issue=3|pages=615–628|doi=10.1145/322261.322274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew described the cell-probe model and used it to give a minimum number of memory cell "probes" or accesses necessary to determine whether a given query datum exists within a table stored in memory.

== Formal definition ==
Given a set of data &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; construct a structure consisting of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; memory cells, each able to store &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; bits.  Then when given a query element &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; determine whether &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt; with correctness &lt;math&gt;1 - \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; by accessing &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; memory cells.  Such an algorithm is called an &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-error &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;-probe algorithm using &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; cells with word size &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.  
&lt;ref name="chakrabarti2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chakrabarti|first=Amit|author2=Regev, Oded |title=An optimal randomised cell probe lower bound for approximate nearest neighbour searching|journal=Proceedings of the 45th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|date=2004|pages=473–482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable results ==

=== Dynamic Partial Sums ===
The dynamic partial sum problem defines two operations {{smallcaps|Update}}&lt;math&gt;(k,v)&lt;/math&gt; which conceptually operation sets the value in an array &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; at index &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and {{smallcaps|Sum}}&lt;math&gt;(k)&lt;/math&gt; which returns the sum of the values in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; at indices &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.  Such an implementation would take &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time for {{smallcaps|Update}} and &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time for {{smallcaps|Sum}}.&lt;ref name="zatloukal2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zatloukal|first=Kevin|title=Notes on "Logarithmic Lower Bounds in the Cell-Probe Model"|url=http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~anuprao/pubs/CSE533Autumn2010/zatloukaldynamiclowerbound.pdf|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, if the values are stored as leaves in a tree whose inner nodes store the values of the subtree rooted at that node.  In this structure {{smallcaps|Update}} requires &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; time to update each node in the leaf to root path, and {{smallcaps|Sum}} similarly requires &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; time to traverse the tree from leaf to root summing the values of all subtrees left of the query index.

[[Mihai Pătraşcu]] used the cell-probe model and an information transfer argument to show that the partial sums problem requires &lt;math&gt;\Omega\left(\log n\right)&lt;/math&gt; time per operation.&lt;ref name="patrascu2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patrascu_morin" /&gt;

=== Approximate Nearest Neighbor Searching ===
The exact [[Nearest neighbor search]] problem is to determine the closest in a set of input points to a given query point.  An approximate version of this problem is often considered since many applications of this problem are in very high dimension spaces and solving the problem in high dimensions requires exponential time or space with respect to the dimension.&lt;ref name="chakrabarti2004" /&gt;

Chakrabarti and Regev proved that the approximate nearest neighbor search problem on the [[Hamming distance#Special properties|Hamming cube]] using polynomial storage and &lt;math&gt;d^{O(1)}&lt;/math&gt; word size requires a worst-case query time of &lt;math&gt;\Omega\left(\frac{\log\log d}{\log\log\log d}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.  This proof used the cell-probe model and information theoretic techniques for communication complexity.

[[Image:Zayka-apache.jpg|thumb|250px|A ceramic knife.]]
A '''ceramic knife''' is a [[knife]] designed with a [[ceramic]] blade typically made from [[zirconium dioxide]] (ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; also known as zirconia).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kyoceraadvancedceramics.com/ceramic-advantage/frequently-asked-questions#q1 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210064529/http://kyoceraadvancedceramics.com/ceramic-advantage/frequently-asked-questions#q1#q1 |archive-date=2015-12-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These knife blades are usually produced through the dry-pressing and firing of powdered zirconia using solid-state [[sintering]]. It is 8.5 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], compared to 4.5 for normal steel and 7.5 to 8 for hardened steel and 10 for [[diamond]]. The resultant blade has a hard edge that stays sharper for longer when compared to conventional steel knives. While the edge is harder than steel knives, it is less tough than steel knives; no surprise that ceramic blades are more brittle than steel blades. The ceramic blade is sharpened by grinding the edges with a diamond-dust-coated [[grinding wheel]].

== Zirconium oxide ==
{{See also|Yttria-stabilized zirconia}}
[[File:Dalstrong Ceramic Knife.png|thumb|A ceramic knife made from blackened zirconia, super heated under pressure.]]
Zirconium oxide is used due to its [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. It exists in three phases: [[Monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]], [[Tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]] and [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]]. Cooling to the monoclinic phase after sintering causes a large volume change, which often causes stress fractures in pure zirconia. Additives such as [[Magnesium oxide|magnesia]], [[Calcium oxide|calcia]] and [[Yttrium oxide|yttria]] are used in the manufacture of the knife material to stabilize the high-temperature phases and minimize this volume change. The highest strength and toughness is produced by the addition of 3&amp;nbsp;mol% yttrium oxide yielding partially stabilized zirconia. This material consists of a mixture of tetragonal and cubic phases with a bending strength of nearly 1,200 MPa. Small cracks allow phase transformations to occur, which essentially close the cracks and prevent catastrophic failure, resulting in a relatively tough ceramic material, sometimes known as TTZ (transformation-toughened zirconia).

== Properties ==
Ceramic knives are substantially harder than steel knives, will not corrode in harsh environments,&lt;ref name="Japan2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=The Ceramic Society of Japan|title=Advanced Ceramic Technologies &amp; Products|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ne_-zaLqI8C&amp;pg=PA529|date=31 July 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-4-431-53913-1|pages=529–}}&lt;/ref&gt; are non-magnetic, and do not conduct electricity at room temperature. Because of their resistance to strong acid and caustic substances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Bee|title=At the cutting edge: ceramic knives|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/9341246/At-the-cutting-edge-ceramic-knives.html|accessdate=27 July 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=22 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their ability to retain a cutting edge longer than forged metal knives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Applied Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zh5VJNseL2AC&amp;pg=PA61|publisher=PediaPress|pages=61–|id=GGKEY:RNQ8YX0N04Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; ceramic knives are better suited for slicing boneless meat, vegetables, fruit and bread. Since ceramics are brittle, blades may break if dropped on a hard surface although improved manufacturing processes have reduced this risk. They are also unsuitable for chopping through bones, or frozen foods, or in other applications which require prying, which may result in chipping. Several brands now offer either a black-coloured or a designed blade made through an additional [[hot isostatic pressing]] step, which increases the toughness.

== Sharpening and general care ==
[[File:Dalstrong Edgelast Sharpener.png|thumb|A diamond dust sharpener with cradle for a ceramic knife.]]
Unlike a traditional steel blade that benefits from regular honing and resharpening in order to keep a sharp edge, a ceramic knife will stay sharp and retain its cutting edge for much longer—up to 10x longer according to some tests.&lt;ref&gt;http://kyoceraadvancedceramics.com/ceramic-advantage/kyocera-technology. "Recent tests show that the life of a Kyocera ceramic blade without resharpening is approximately 10 times that of a typical steel blade." The Cutlery and Allied Trades Research Association (CATRA), an independent testing organization.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The inherent hardness of the ceramic material also makes it more difficult for the consumer to resharpen.&lt;ref name="Puck2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Puck|title=Wolfgang Puck Makes It Easy: Delicious Recipes for Your Home Kitchen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgPAagtOoDUC&amp;pg=PA269|date=8 April 2007|publisher=Thomas Nelson|isbn=978-1-4185-7093-4|pages=269–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a ceramic knife therefore does not need regular sharpening in the same way as steel, its blade edge will eventually degrade or chip and lose its cutting edge, at which point specialized sharpening services are required for the ceramic edge.&lt;ref name="TableJay2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sur La Table|author2=Sarah Jay|title=Knives Cooks Love: Selection. Care. Techniques. Recipes.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsX7A6HzaWkC&amp;pg=PA12|date=21 October 2008|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=978-0-7407-7002-9|pages=12–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">A '''character''' is a [[sign (semiotic)|sign]] or [[symbol]].

==History==
[[Ancient Greek|Greek]]  {{lang|grc|χαρακτήρ}} is a nomen agentis of the verb {{lang|grc|χαράσσω}} (''charassō'') with a meaning "to sharpen, to whet", and also "to make cake",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxara%2Fssw χαράσσω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from a [[PIE root]] ''{{PIE|*g'ʰer-}}'' "cut" also continued in Irish ''gearr'' and English ''gash'', which is perhaps an early loan ultimately from the same Greek root.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gash?rskey=Oftsw6&amp;result=1#m_en_gb0327980 gash], on Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{lang|grc|χαρακτήρ}} is thus an "engraver",  originally in the sense of a craftsman, but then also used for a tool used for engraving, and for a stamp for minting coins. From the stamp, the meaning was extended to the stamp impression, [[Plato]] using the noun in the sense of "engraved mark". In [[Plutarch]], the word could refer to a figure or letter, [[Lucian]] uses it of [[hieroglyph]]s as opposed to Greek ''grammata'' (''Herm''. 44)

Metaphorically, it could refer to a distinctive mark, [[Herodotus]] (1.57) using it of a particular dialect, or (1.116) of a characteristic mark of an individual. The collective noun {{lang|grc|χαρακτηριστικά}} "characteristics" appears later, in [[Dionysius Halicarnassensis]].

Via Latin ''{{lang|la|charactēr}}'', Old French ''{{lang|fr|caracter}}'', the word passed into [[Middle English]] as ''{{lang|und|caracter}}'' in the 14th century. [[John Wycliffe|Wycliffe]] (1382) has ''To haue a {{lang|und|caracter}} [...] in her forhedis'' ({{bibleref|Revelation|13:16}}) for the [[mark of the beast]] (translating {{lang|grc|χάραγμα}} "imprinted or branded mark").

==Grapheme==
The word was used in the sense of [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] or [[grapheme]] by [[William Caxton]], referring to the [[Phoenician alphabet]],  ''The Fenyces were the fyrst inuentours of {{lang|und|caracteris}} dyfferencing that one fro{{Clarify|date=June 2016}} that other, of whiche were fourmed lettres for to write'' (''Eneydos'' 6.25). As in Greek, the word was used especially for foreign or mysterious graphemes (such as [[Chinese character|Chinese]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], or [[Runes|Runic]] ones)  as opposed to the familiar ''letters''; in particular of [[shorthand]] (in ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' (chapter 38) sarcastically of [[shorthand]], "a procession of new horrors, called arbitrary characters; the most despotic characters I have ever known"), and since 1949 in computing (see [[character (computing)]].

As a collective noun, the word can refer to writing or printing in general ([[Shakespeare's sonnet]] [[Sonnet 59|nr. 59]]: ''Since minde at first in carrecter was done'', viz. "since  thought was first put in writing").

==Esotericism and magic==
{{see|Diabolical signature}}
The word in [[Renaissance magic]] came to refer to any astrological, cabbalistic or magical sign or symbol. Related is the [[Sacramental character]] of Catholic doctrine.
Famously, [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] designed his ''[[Monas Hieroglyphica]]'' in 1564.

In the  19th century, this sense of the word appears mainly in Romantic poetry, such as  Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''Lay of the last minstrel'' (1805), where "A hallow'd taper shed a glimmering light / On mystic implements of magic might; On cross, and character, and talisman," (6.17).

==Semiotics and epistemology==
{{see|sign (semiotics)}}

From the esoteric or mystical meanings, Early Modern learned authors abstracted a notion of ''Character'' as a code or hierarchical system that embodied all knowledge or all of [[reality]], or a written representation of a [[philosophical language]] that would recover the "[[true name]]s" lost in the [[confusion of tongues]]. 

This idea had currency as a kind of epistemological [[philosophers' stone]] for about a century, from the mid 17th century, with [[Francis Lodwick]] (1642) and [[John Wilkins]]'s  ''Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language''  (1668), to the later 18th century and the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' where in a long entry under the heading ''Charactère'', [[D'Alembert]] critically reviewed such projects of the past century.

[[File:Stamen of euphorbia milii.jpg|thumb|In euphorbia milii-large]]
A '''cyathium''' (plural: '''cyathia''') is one of the specialised [[Pseudanthium|pseudanthia]] ("false flowers") forming the [[inflorescence]] of plants in the genus ''[[Euphorbia]]'' ([[Euphorbiaceae]]). A cyathium consists of:

* Five (rarely four) bracteoles. These are small, united [[bract]]s, which form a cup-like involucre. Their upper tips are free and in the beginning cover the opening of the involucre (like the shutter of a camera). These alternate with:
* Five (1 to 10) [[nectar gland]]s, which are sometimes fused.
* One extremely reduced female flower standing in the centre at the base of the involucre, consisting of an [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] on a short stem with [[pistil]], and surrounded by:
* Five groups (one group at the base of each bracteole) of extremely reduced male flowers, which each consist of a single [[anther]] on a stem.

The flower-like characteristics of the cyathia are underlined by brightly coloured nectar glands and often by [[petal]]-like appendages to the nectar glands, or brightly coloured, petal-like bracts positioned under the cyathia. The paired petal-like bracts of ''Euphorbia'' section ''Goniostema'' are called ''cyathophylls''. here female to male flower ratio is 1:α

The cyathia are sometimes solitary, but are usually in [[Cyme (botany)|cymes]], [[inflorescences]] of the second order, in pseudumbels, on dichotomously branched stalks or in so-called simple cymes which consist of one central and two lateral cyathia.

In one group of Madagascan species in the sub-family Euphorbia section Goniostema (''E. aueoviridiflora'', ''E. capmanambatoensis'', ''E. iharanae'', ''E. leuconeura'', ''E. neohumbertii'', ''E. viguieri'') there is a tendency for a further pseudanthium to grow from the cyme. Probably as an adaptation to pollination by [[bird]]s, the cyathia have become specialised: Most cyathia have upright cyathophylles which surround them protectively, but render the nectar glands inaccessible. To compensate, between them are naked sterile cyathia whose only job is to produce nectar.

A '''Dangerous Goods Safety Advisor (DGSA)''' is a consultant or an owner or employee of an organization appointed by an organization that transports, loads, or unloads dangerous goods in the [[European Union]] and other countries. This include 48 countries :
Albania, Andorra, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Montenegro, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, The Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom.

==Rules==
The rules involving the transport of dangerous goods are complex and each mode of transport, i.e. road, rail or inland waterway, has its own set of regulations.  There are also separate sets of regulations for sea and air transportation.  For many elements of transportation the regulations from each mode are similar or identical.  All the various sets of regulations are based upon "Recommendations on the transport of Dangerous Goods - Model Regulations", known as "The Orange Book," issued by the [[United Nations]] Committee of Experts on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods and the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling.

==Duties== 
The duties of the DGSA include providing advice to the appointing organization, preparing accident reports, monitoring the activities of the organisation which involve dangerous goods and preparing an annual report.

To become a DGSA, it is usual for a candidate to be trained by a specialist training organization, then to sit various examinations. The qualification lasts five years. The examining body in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] is the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''David Greetham''' (born October 21, 1941) is an Anglo-American literary critic and the founder of the [[Society for Textual Scholarship]].

==Career==

Greetham received his undergraduate degree from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1963 and completed his Ph.D. in English at the [[City University of New York]].

[[Marta Werner]] of [[D'Youville College]] describes Greetham as "drawn to texts that spill over the boundaries of genre, that exist in multiple versions, that explore intertextuality, and that complicate in various other ways the notion of text as fixed or stable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warner|first1=Marta|title=Post-Everything|journal=Text|date=2003|volume=15|pages=337–349|ref=post_everything|jstor=30227799}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works, Greetham has sought to co-opt "the terminology
and practice of literary theory in re-designating textual operations in
the guise of ... literature, anthropology, sociology,
gender studies, history, political science, linguistics, psychology, [and]
philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greetham|first1=David C.|title=Theories of the Text|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67Yg06eUaDkC|accessdate=15 April 2015|ref=theories_text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a theorist of scholarly editing, Greetham has taken up a middle ground between [[intentionalist]] positions like that of [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] and the [[social textual criticism]] of [[Jerome McGann]], maintaining the goal of establishing an authoritative text while allowing the possibility that multiple authorized versions can exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathijsen|first1=Marita|title=The Concept of Authorisation|journal=Text|date=2002|volume=14|pages=85–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his later work, Greetham has moved away from the idea that an editor can establish a "psychic" connection with the author through which he or she can determine the author's true intentions, instead seeing editing as an occasion for reflections on the ideology underlying scholarly practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Werner|first1=Marta|title=Signals from a Distance: Editing, Telepathy, Elegy|journal=Textual Cultures|date=2008|volume=3|issue=1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society for Textual Scholarship==

Greetham was one of the founders of the Society for Textual Scholarship and served as the Society's President from 1999 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Society for Textual Scholarship|journal=Textual Cultures|date=Spring 2011|volume=6|issue=1|pages=166–169|jstor=10.2979/textcult.6.1.166|ref=soc_text|doi=10.2979/textcult.6.1.166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1979, the Society provides an interdisciplinary forum for presentation of research in a number of textual disciplines. Notable past members have included [[G. Thomas Tanselle]], [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], [[Fredson Bowers]], and [[Jerome McGann]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7744">'''Distinguishable interfaces''' use computer graphic principles to automatically
generate easily distinguishable appearance for computer data.

Although the [[desktop metaphor]] revolutionized user interfaces, there is evidence
that a spatial layout alone does little to help in locating files and other data;
distinguishable appearance is also required.
Studies have shown that average users have considerable difficulty finding files
on their personal computers, even ones that they created the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | pages = 647–656
  | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Search engines do not always help, since it has been found that users
often know of the existence of a file without being able to specify relevant search terms.
On the contrary, people appear to incrementally search for files using some form of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently researchers and web developers have argued that the problem is the
lack of distinguishable appearance:  in the traditional computer interface most objects
and locations appear identical.  This problem rarely occurs in the real world, where
both objects and locations generally have easily distinguishable appearance.
Discriminability was one of the recommendations in the 
ISO 9241-12 recommendation on presentation of information on visual displays
(part of the overall report on [[ISO_9241|Ergonomics of Human System Interaction]]),
however it was assumed in that report that this would be achieved by manual 
design of graphical symbols.

==VisualIDs, semanticons, and identicons==
The mass availability of computer graphics supported the introduction of approaches
that make better use of the brain's "visual hardware", by providing
individual files and other abstract data with distinguishable appearance.
This idea initially appeared in strictly academic 
VisualIDs&lt;ref name="visualids"&gt;

works, but the web community has explored and rapidly adopted similar ideas, such as the [[Identicon]].

The VisualIDs project&lt;ref name="visualids" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

automatically generated icons for files or other data based 
on a hash of the data identifier, so the icons had no relation to the content or meaning of the data.
It was argued not only that generating meaningful icons is unnecessary&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | title = VisualIDs: FAQ
  | url = http://scribblethink.org/Work/VisualIDs/visualids_faq.html#meaningful
  | accessdate = 19 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (their user study showed rapid learning of the arbitrary icons), 
but also that basing icons on ''content'' is actually ''incorrect''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | first = J.P.

The Semanticons project&lt;ref name="semanticons" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | last = Piquepaille

developed by Setlur et al. demonstrated an algorithm to create icons that reflect the content of files.
In this work the name, location and content of a file are parsed and used to retrieve
related image(s) from an image database.  These are then processed using a [[Non-photorealistic rendering]] technique in order to generate graphical icons.

Developer Don Park introduced the [[identicon]] library for making a visual icon from a hash
of a data identifier.  This initial public implementation has spawned a large number
of implementations for various environments.  In particular, identicons are
now being used as default visual user identifiers (avatars) for several widely used systems.  They are also used as a complement to [[Gravatar]]s, which are pre-existing avatar images created or chosen by users, instead of automatically generated images.
(see [[#External links]]).

==Current research==
While current web practice has followed the semantics-free approach of VisualIDs,
recent research has followed the semantics-based approach of Semanticons.
Examples include using data mining principles to automatically create "intelligent icons"
that reflect the contents of files&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

An '''ecodistrict''' or eco-district is a neologism associating the terms "district" and "eco" as an abbreviation of ecological.
It designates an [[Urbanism|urban]] planning aiming to integrate objectives of "[[sustainable development]]" and reduce the [[ecological footprint]] of the project. This notion insists on the consideration of the whole environmental issues by attributing them ambitious levels of requirements.

The '''electrical penetration graph''' or '''EPG''' is a system used by biologists to study the interaction of [[insect]]s such as [[aphid]]s, [[thrips]], and [[leafhopper]]s with [[plant]]s. Therefore, it can also be used to study the basis of [[plant virus]] transmission, host plant selection by insects and the way in which insects can find and feed from the [[phloem]] of the plant. It is a simple system consisting of a partial [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] which is only completed when a species such as aphids, which are the most abundantly studied, inserts its [[stylet (anatomy)|stylet]] into the plant in order to ''probe'' the plant as a suitable host for feeding. The completed circuit is displayed visually as a graph with different waveforms indicating either different insect activities such as saliva excretion or the ingestion of cellular contents or indicating which tissue type has been penetrated (i.e. [[phloem]], [[xylem]] or [[Leaf#Mesophyll|mesophyll]]). So far, around ten different graphical waveforms are known, correlating with different insect/plant interaction events.

== The Circuit ==
The circuit connects to the insect via a 20&amp;nbsp;µm [[gold]] or [[platinum]] wire and to the plant via a copper electrode placed in the soil. The circuit also passes through, normally, a one [[gigaohm]] [[resistor]] and a 50x [[amplifier]] before the results are stored digitally and interpreted by a computer to calculate the final graph.

The '''Encyclopedia of Life''' ('''EOL''') is a free, online collaborative encyclopedia intended to document all of the 1.9 million [[Life|living]] [[species]] known to science. It is compiled from existing databases and from contributions by experts and non-experts throughout the world.&lt;ref name="EOL_Hist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/the_history_of_eol |title=EOL History |publisher=Eol.org |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to build one "infinitely expandable" page for each species, including video, sound, images, graphics, as well as text.&lt;ref name="odling-smee2007"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070508/full/070508-7.html | title=Encyclopedia of Life launched | accessdate=2007-05-09 | last=Odling-Smee | first=Lucy | date=2007-05-09 | work=Nature | doi=10.1038/news070508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Encyclopedia incorporates content from the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]], which digitizes millions of pages of printed literature from the world's major natural history libraries. The project was initially backed by a US$50 million funding commitment, led by the [[MacArthur Foundation]] and the [[Sloan Foundation]], who provided US$20 million and US$5 million, respectively. The additional US$25 million came from five cornerstone institutions—the [[Field Museum]], [[Harvard University]], the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], and the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The project was initially led by Jim Edwards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/22 |title=James Edwards - Encyclopedia of Life |publisher=Eol.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development team by [[David J. Patterson|David Patterson]]. Today, participating institutions and individual donors continue to support EOL through financial contributions.

==Overview==
EOL went live on 26 February 2008 with 30,000 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/26/science/26ency.html |title=The Encyclopedia of Life, No Bookshelf Required | work=The New York Times |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2008-02-27 |first=Carl |last=Zimmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site immediately proved to be extremely popular, and temporarily had to revert to demonstration pages for two days when over 11 million views of it were requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | title=Life Encyclopedia Debut Too Popular to Stay "Live" | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/02/080227-AP-encyclopedi.html  | work=National Geographic | date=February 27, 2008 | accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site relaunched on 5 September 2011 with a redesigned interface and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/sept_5 |title=New Version of Encyclopedia of Life Now Available – Encyclopedia of Life |publisher=Eol.org |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new version – referred to as EOLv2 – was developed in response to requests from the general public, citizen scientists, educators and professional biologists for a site that was more engaging, accessible and personal. EOLv2 is redesigned to enhance usability and encourage contributions and interactions among users. It is also internationalized with interfaces provided for [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] language speakers. On 16 January 2014, EOL launched TraitBank, a searchable, open digital repository for organism traits, measurements, interactions and other facts for all taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/content/traitbank-practical-semantics-organism-attribute-data |title=TraitBank: Practical semantics for organism attribute data |publisher=Semantic-web-journal.net |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative's Executive Committee includes senior officers from the Atlas of Living Australia, the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]] consortium, the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], [[CONABIO]], [[Field Museum]], [[Harvard University]], the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] (Library of Alexandria), [[MacArthur Foundation]], [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], [[Sloan Foundation]], and the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6638017.stm | title=Scientists compile 'book of life' | accessdate=2007-05-09 | date=2007-05-09 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/meet_the_team#executive |title=Meet the Team: Executive Committee |publisher=EOL |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intention  ==
Information about many species is already available from a variety of sources, in particular about the [[megafauna]]. Gathering currently available data on all 1.9 million species will take about 10 years.&lt;ref name="rc1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Science-Sante/2007/05/09/001-encyclopedie-vie.shtml?ref=rss | title=Encyclopédie de la vie: Une arche de Noé virtuelle! | date=9 May 2007 | work=Radio-Canada | accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011|09}}, EOL had information on more than 700,000 species available, along with more than 600,000 photos and millions of pages of scanned literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/sept_5 |title=New Version of the Encyclopedia of Life Now Available |publisher=Eol.org |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative relies on indexing information compiled by other efforts, including the Sp2000 and [[Integrated Taxonomic Information System|ITIS]] [[Catalogue of Life]], [[Fishbase]] and the Assembling Tree of Life project of [[National Science Foundation|NSF]], AmphibiaWeb, Mushroom explorer, microscope, etc. The initial focus has been on living species but will later include extinct species. As the discovery of new species is expected to continue (currently at about 20,000 per year), the encyclopedia will continue to grow. As taxonomy finds new ways to include species discovered by molecular techniques, the rate of new additions will increase, particularly in respect to the microbial work of (eu)bacteria, archaebacteria and viruses.

EOL's goal is to serve as a resource for the general public, enthusiastic amateurs, educators, students and professional scientists from around the world.&lt;ref name="EOL_Hist"/&gt;

==Resources and collaborations==
The Encyclopedia of Life has content partners around the world who share information through the EOL platform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/content_partners |title=EOL Content Partners |publisher=Eol.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Wikipedia and [[Flickr]].

Its interface is translated at [[translatewiki.net]].

The '''European green infrastructure''' is an important part of the new (post-2010) EU strategy for [[biodiversity]] and biodiversity policy.

It is one of the main tools to tackle threats on biodiversity resulting from [[habitat fragmentation]], land use change and loss of habitats.
Green Infrastructure will play a decisive role in integrating biodiversity into other policies, such as agriculture, forestry, water, marine and fisheries, regional and cohesion policy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, transport, energy and land use policy. It is also an important tool for existing Directives such as the [[Water Framework Directive]], the Marine Framework Directive, [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] and Strategic Environment Assessment Directives.

In addition, particular attention will be given to strengthening the integration of green infrastructure aspects in the EU’s various funding programmes (e.g. structural and cohesion funds, CAP, LIFE) over the current and future financial programming period starting in 2013 and to improving the ecological coherence of the [[Natura 2000]] Network.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
Many [[scientist]]s and [[Philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] have described '''evolution as fact and theory''', a phrase which was used as the title of an article by [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in 1981. He describes ''fact'' in science as meaning [[data]], not absolute certainty but "confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent". A [[scientific theory]] is a well-substantiated explanation of such facts. The facts of [[evolution]] come from observational evidence of current processes, from imperfections in organisms recording historical [[common descent]], and from transitions in the [[fossil]] record. Theories of evolution provide a provisional explanation for these facts.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay (1981) [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html "Evolution as Fact and Theory"] ''Discover'' 2 (May): 34-37; Reprinted in ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'' New York: W. W. Norton, 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o6g2tvN0nJoC&amp;pg=PA253 pp. 253-262.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the words "evolution", "fact" and "theory" has several meanings in different contexts. ''Evolution'' means change over time, as in [[stellar evolution]]. In [[biology]] it refers to observed changes in organisms, to their descent from a common ancestor, and at a technical level to a change in [[gene frequency]] over time; it can also refer to explanatory theories (such as [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]]) which explain the mechanisms of evolution. To a scientist, ''fact'' can describe a repeatable observation that all can agree on; it can refer to something that is so well established that nobody in a community disagrees with it; and it can also refer to the truth or falsity of a proposition. To the public, ''theory'' can mean an opinion or conjecture (''e.g.'', "it's only a theory"), but among scientists it has a much stronger connotation of "well-substantiated explanation". With this number of choices, people can often talk past each other, and meanings become the subject of [[Ordinary language philosophy|linguistic analysis]].

Evidence for evolution continues to be accumulated and tested. The scientific literature includes statements by evolutionary [[biologist]]s and philosophers of science demonstrating some of the different perspectives on evolution as fact and theory.

==Evolution, fact and theory==
Evolution has been described as "fact and theory"; "fact, not theory"; "only a theory, not a fact"; "multiple theories, not fact"; and "neither fact, nor theory."&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Evolution as theory and fact in the literature|section 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreements among these statements, however, have more to do with the meaning of words than the substantial issues and this controversy is discussed below.

===Evolution===
{{Life timeline}}
{{Main|Introduction to evolution|Evolution}}
Professor of biology [[Jerry Coyne]] sums up biological evolution succinctly:
:''Life on earth evolved gradually beginning with one primitive species—perhaps a self-replicating molecule—that lived more than 3.5 billion years ago; it then branched out over time, throwing off many new and diverse species; and the mechanism for most (but not all) of evolutionary change is natural selection.''{{sfn|Coyne|2009|p=3}}

This shows the breadth and scope of the issue, incorporating the scientific fields of [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[genetics]], [[geology]], and [[paleontology]], among many others.

But the central core of evolution is generally defined as changes in trait or gene frequency in a population of organisms from one generation to the next.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|p=400}} This has been dubbed the standard genetic definition of evolution. Natural selection is only one of several mechanisms in the theory of evolutionary change that explains how organisms historically adapt to changing environments. The principles of heredity were re-discovered in 1900, after Darwin's death, in [[Gregor Mendel]]'s research on the inheritance of simple trait variations in peas.{{sfn|Wright|1984}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Subsequent work into genetics, [[mutation]], paleontology, and [[developmental biology]] expanded the applicability and scope of Darwin's original theory.

According to [[Douglas J. Futuyma]]:
:''Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different [[allele]]s within a population (such as those determining [[blood type]]s) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest [[Obcell|proto-organism]] to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions.''{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

The word ''evolution'' in a broad sense refers to processes of change, from stellar evolution to changes in language. In biology, the meaning is more specific: heritable changes which accumulate over generations of a population. Individual organisms do not evolve in their lifetimes, but variations in the genes they inherit can become more or less common in the population of organisms. Any changes during the lifetime of organisms which are not inherited by their offspring are not part of biological evolution.&lt;ref name="Moran_What"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html |title=What is Evolution? |last=Moran |first=Laurence |year=1993 |website=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To [[Keith Stewart Thomson]], the word evolution has at least three distinct meanings:&lt;ref name="Thomson_1982"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomson |first=Keith Stewart |authorlink=Keith Stewart Thomson |date=September–October 1982 |title=Marginalia: The meanings of evolution |journal=[[American Scientist]] |location=Research Triangle Park, NC |publisher=[[Sigma Xi]] |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=529–531 |jstor=27851662 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The general sense of ''change over time''.
#All life forms have descended with modifications from ancestors in a process of common descent.
#The cause or mechanisms of these process of change, that are examined and explained by evolutionary theories.

Thomson remarks: "Change over time is a fact, and descent from common ancestors is based on such unassailable logic that we act as though it is a fact. Natural selection provides the outline of an explanatory theory."&lt;ref name="Thomson_1982" /&gt;

Biologists consider it to be a scientific fact that evolution has occurred in that modern organisms differ from past forms, and evolution is still occurring with discernible differences between organisms and their descendants. There is such strong quantitative support for the second that scientists regard common descent as being as factual as the understanding that in the [[Solar System]] the Earth orbits the Sun, although the examination of the fundamentals of these processes is still in progress. There are several theories about the mechanisms of evolution, and there are still active debates about specific mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Moran_fact_theory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html |title=Evolution is a Fact and a Theory |last=Moran |first=Laurence |year=1993 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a fourth meaning for the word ''evolution'' that is ''not'' used by biologists today. In 1857, the philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]] defined it as "change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous." He claimed (before Darwin) that this was "settled beyond dispute" for organic evolution and applied it to the evolution of star systems, geology and human society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spencer |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Spencer |date=January–April 1857 |title=Progress: its Law and Cause |url=http://hsmt.history.ox.ac.uk/hsmt/courses_reading/undergraduate/authority_of_nature/week_3/spencer.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Westminster Review]] |series=New Series |location=London |publisher=[[John Chapman (publisher)|John Chapman]] |volume=11 |page=446 |oclc=26747836 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Spencer by 1865 was admitting that his definition was imperfect,{{sfn|Spencer|1865|p=[https://archive.org/stream/firstprinciples17spengoog#page/n188/mode/2up 176]}} but it remained popular throughout the nineteenth century before declining under the criticisms of [[William James]] and others.{{sfn|James|1911|loc=[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/j/james/william/memories/chapter6.html Chapter 6: "Herbert Spencer's Autobiography"]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.american-philosophy.org/events/documents/2011_Program_files/S_brady_saap_2011_paper.doc |title=Evolutionary Opponents: William James and Herbert Spencer |last=Brady |first=Michael |date=March 12, 2011 |conference=Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy |conference-url=http://american-philosophy.org/events/saap_2011_program.htm |location=Cheney, WA |format=DOC |accessdate=2013-06-10}} Paper presented at the 38th Annual Meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fact===
{{Main|Scientific fact}}
Fact is often used by scientists to refer to experimental or empirical data or [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] verifiable observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[WordNet]] |title=scientific fact |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=scientific+fact |accessdate=2013-02-21 |year=2010 |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |location=Princeton, NJ |quote=(an observation that has been confirmed repeatedly and is accepted as true (although its truth is never final))}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Views of the National Park Service Glossary |title=Fact |url=http://www2.nature.nps.gov/views/System/Glossary.htm#F |accessdate=2013-02-21 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |location=Washington, D.C. |quote=In science, a fact is an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as 'true.' Truth is science, however, is never final, and what is accepted as a fact today may be modified or even discarded at some point in the future. Source: [[National Academy of Sciences]] (1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fact" is also used in a wider sense to mean any theory for which there is overwhelming evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language  (1996) gives a third meaning of the word "fact" as "(3) A truth known by actual experience or observation; something known to be true: ''‘Scientists gather facts about plant growth.’''"&lt;/ref&gt;
:''A fact is a hypothesis that is so firmly supported by evidence that we assume it is true, and act as if it were true.'' &amp;mdash;Douglas J. Futuyma{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}

In the sense that evolution is overwhelmingly validated by the evidence, it is a fact. It is frequently said to be a fact in the same way as the Earth's revolution around the Sun is a fact.{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Dawkins |last2=Coyne |first2=Jerry |authorlink2=Jerry Coyne |date=September 1, 2005 |title=One side can be wrong |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following quotation from [[Hermann Joseph Muller]]'s article, "One Hundred Years Without Darwinism Are Enough," explains the point.

:''There is no sharp line between speculation, hypothesis, theory, principle, and fact, but only a difference along a sliding scale, in the degree of probability of the idea. When we say a thing is a fact, then, we only mean that its probability is an extremely high one: so high that we are not bothered by doubt about it and are ready to act accordingly. Now in this use of the term fact, the only proper one, evolution is a fact.''&lt;ref name="Muller_1959"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Hermann Joseph |authorlink=Hermann Joseph Muller |date=April 1959 |title=One Hundred Years Without Darwinism Are Enough |url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/evolut/100pcnts.htm |journal=School Science and Mathematics |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=304–305 |doi=10.1111/j.1949-8594.1959.tb08235.x |ref=harv}} Reprinted in: {{harvnb|Zetterberg|1983|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Academy of Sciences]] (U.S.) makes a similar point:

:''Scientists most often use the word "fact" to describe an observation. But scientists can also use fact to mean something that has been tested or observed so many times that there is no longer a compelling reason to keep testing or looking for examples. The occurrence of evolution in this sense is a fact. Scientists no longer question whether descent with modification occurred because the evidence supporting the idea is so strong.''&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAS 1999|NAS 1999]], [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=28 p. 28]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Jay Gould also points out that "Darwin continually emphasized the difference between his two great and separate accomplishments: establishing the fact of evolution, and proposing a theory—natural selection—to explain the mechanism of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1981}}, citing {{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |title=[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]] |authorlink=Charles Darwin |year=1871 |pages=152–153}} The book is available from [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=165 The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online]. Retrieved 2015-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; These two aspects are frequently confused. Scientists continue to argue about particular explanations or mechanisms at work in specific instances of evolution – but the fact that evolution has occurred, and is still occurring, is undisputed.

A common misconception is that evolution cannot be reliably observed because it all happened millions of years ago and the science therefore is not dependent on facts (in the initial sense above). However, both Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], the co-founders of the theory, and all subsequent biologists depend primarily on observations of living organisms; Darwin concentrated largely on the breeding of domesticated animals whereas Wallace started from the [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] distribution of species in the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Malay Archipelago]]. In the early twentieth century, [[population genetics]] had centre stage, and more recently [[DNA]] has become the main focus of observation and experimentation.

Philosophers of science argue that we do not know mind-independent empirical truths with absolute certainty: even direct observations may be "theory laden" and depend on assumptions about our senses and the measuring instruments used. In this sense all facts are provisional.&lt;ref name="Moran_fact_theory" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/falsify.html |title=Evolution and Philosophy: Is Evolution Science, and What Does 'Science' Mean? |year=1997 |last=Wilkins |first=John S. |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory===
{{Main|Scientific theory}}
The [[Theory#Scientific theories|scientific definition]] of the word "theory" is different from the definition of the word in [[wiktionary:colloquial|colloquial]] use. In the vernacular, "theory" can refer to guesswork, a simple [[conjecture]], an [[opinion]], or a [[Speculative reason|speculation]] that does not have to be based on facts and need not be framed for making testable predictions.

In science, however, the meaning of theory is more rigorous. A scientific theory is "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, [[Scientific law|law]]s, inferences, and tested [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAS 1999|NAS 1999]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=2 p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Theories are formed from hypotheses that have been subjected repeatedly to tests of evidence which attempt to disprove or [[falsifiability|falsify]] them. In the case of evolution through natural selection, Darwin conceived the hypothesis around 1839, and made a first draft of the concept three years later in 1842. He discussed this widely with many of his intellectual companions, and conducted further research in the background to his other writings and work. After years of development, he finally published his evidence and theory in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Wyhe |first=John |authorlink=John van Wyhe |date=May 22, 2007 |title=Mind the gap: Did Darwin avoid publishing his theory for many years? |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=1 |journal=[[Notes and Records|Notes and Records of the Royal Society]] |location=London |publisher=[[Royal Society]] |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=177–205 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2006.0171 |accessdate=2015-01-17 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "theory of evolution" is actually a network of theories that created the [[research program]] of biology. Darwin, for example, proposed five separate theories in his original formulation, which included mechanistic explanations for:
# [[Anagenesis|populations changing over generations]]
# [[Gradualism#Geology and biology|gradual]] change
# [[speciation]]
# [[natural selection]]
# [[common descent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bock |first=Walter J. |date=May 2007 |title=Explanations in evolutionary theory |journal=[[Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=89–103 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.2007.00412.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since Darwin, evolution has become a well-supported body of interconnected statements that explains numerous empirical observations in the natural world. Evolutionary theories continue to generate testable predictions and explanations about living and fossilized organisms.&lt;ref name="Fitzhugh_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fitzhugh |first=Kirk |authorlink=Kirk J.

[[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] theory is an example of evolutionary theory. It is based on the evolutionary premise of an ancestral descendant sequence of genes, populations, or species. Individuals that evolve are linked together through historical and genealogical ties. [[Phylogenetic tree|Evolutionary trees]] are hypotheses that are inferred through the practice of phylogenetic theory. They depict relations among individuals that can speciate and diverge from one another. The evolutionary process of speciation creates groups that are linked by [[monophyly|a common ancestor and all its descendants]]. Species inherit traits, which are then passed on to descendants. Evolutionary biologists use [[systematics|systematic]] methods and test phylogenetic theory to [[Talk:Evolution/FAQ#Has evolution ever been observed?|observe]] and explain changes in and among species over time. These methods include the collection, measurement, observation, and mapping of traits onto evolutionary trees. Phylogenetic theory is used to test the independent distributions of traits and their various forms to provide explanations of observed patterns in relation to their evolutionary history and biology.{{sfn|Wiley|Lieberman|2011|p=300}}{{Verify source|type=page number|date=January 2015}}{{sfn|Schuh|2000}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}} The [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]] is used to study evolution as a null model against which tests for natural selection can be applied.

==Evolution as theory and fact in the literature==
The following sections provide specific quotable references from evolutionary biologists and philosophers of science demonstrating some of the different perspectives on evolution as fact and theory.

===Evolution as fact===
*American zoologist and paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] stated that "Darwin... finally and definitely established evolution as a fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_stat.htm |title=Is the theory of evolution merely a 'theory'? |last=Robinson |first=Bruce A. |website=Religioustolerance.org |publisher=[[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] |location=Kingston, Ontario |accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hermann Joseph Muller wrote, "So enormous, ramifying, and consistent has the evidence for evolution become that if anyone could now disprove it, I should have my conception of the orderliness of the universe so shaken as to lead me to doubt even my own existence. If you like, then, I will grant you that in an absolute sense evolution is not a fact, or rather, that it is no more a fact than that you are hearing or reading these words."&lt;ref name="Muller_1959" /&gt;
*[[Kenneth R. Miller]] writes, "evolution is as much a fact as anything we know in science."{{sfn|Miller|2007}}
*[[Ernst Mayr]] observed, "The basic theory of evolution has been confirmed so completely that most modern biologists consider evolution simply a fact. How else except by the word evolution can we designate the sequence of faunas and floras in precisely dated geological strata? And evolutionary change is also simply a fact owing to the changes in the content of gene pools from generation to generation."{{sfn|Mayr|1988}}

===Evolution as fact ''and'' theory===
"Fact" is commonly used to refer to the observable changes in organisms' traits over generations while the word "theory" is reserved for the mechanisms that cause these changes:

*Writing in 1930, biologist [[Julian Huxley]] entitled the third book of the wide-ranging series ''[[The Science of Life]]'', which dealt with the fossil record and the evidence of plant and animal structures, ''The Incontrovertible Fact of Evolution''. He also says "Natural Selection...is not a theory but a fact. But does it...suffice to account for the whole spectacle of Evolution?...There we come to speculative matter, to theories." But he concludes that "the broad positions of Darwinism re-emerge from a scrutiny of the most exacting sort essentially unchanged."{{sfn|Wells|Huxley|Wells|1931|pp=[http://www.unz.org/Pub/WellsHG-1931-00425?View=PDF 429], [http://www.unz.org/Pub/WellsHG-1931-00600?View=PDFPages 600]}} In 1932, a portion of the book was republished under the title ''Evolution, Fact and Theory''.
*Stephen Jay Gould writes, "...evolution ''is'' a theory. It is also a fact. And facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts. Facts do not go away when scientists debate rival theories to explain them. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of gravitation replaced [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s, but apples did not suspend themselves in mid-air, pending the outcome. And humans evolved from apelike ancestors whether they did so by Darwin's proposed mechanism or by some other, yet to be discovered."{{sfn|Gould|1981}}
*Similarly, biologist [[Richard Lenski]] says, "Scientific understanding requires both facts and theories that can explain those facts in a coherent manner. Evolution, in this context, is both a fact and a theory. It is an incontrovertible fact that organisms have changed, or evolved, during the history of life on Earth. And biologists have identified and investigated mechanisms that can explain the major patterns of change."&lt;ref name="Lenski_2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/lenski.html |title=Evolution: Fact and Theory |last=Lenski |first=Richard E. |authorlink=Richard Lenski |date=September 2000 |website=actionbioscience |publisher=[[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Biologist [[T. Ryan Gregory]] notes, "biologists rarely make reference to 'the theory of evolution,' referring instead simply to 'evolution' (i.e., the fact of descent with modification) or 'evolutionary theory' (i.e., the increasingly sophisticated body of explanations for the fact of evolution). That evolution is a theory in the proper scientific sense means that there is both a fact of evolution to be explained and a well-supported mechanistic framework to account for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gregory |first1=T. Ryan |authorlink=T. Ryan Gregory |date=January 2008 |title=Evolution as Fact, Theory, and Path |url=http://cmilner-rose.com/files/evolutionfacttheorypath.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=46–52 |doi=10.1007/s12052-007-0001-z |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution as fact and ''not'' theory===

Other commentators – focusing on the changes in species over generations and in some cases common ancestry – have stressed, in order to emphasize the weight of supporting evidence, that evolution is a fact, arguing that the use of the term "theory" is not useful:
*[[Richard Lewontin]] wrote, "It is time for students of the evolutionary process, especially those who have been misquoted and used by the creationists, to state clearly that evolution is ''fact'', not theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewontin  |first=Richard C. |authorlink=Richard Lewontin |date=September 1981 |title=Evolution/Creation Debate: A Time for Truth |journal=[[BioScience]] |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] on behalf of the American Institute of Biological Sciences |volume=31 |issue=8  |page=559 |doi=10.1093/bioscience/31.8.559 |ref=harv}} Reprinted in: {{harvnb|Zetterberg|1983|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Douglas J. Futuyma writes in ''Evolutionary Biology'' (1998), "The statement that organisms have descended with modifications from common ancestors—the historical reality of evolution—is not a theory. It is a fact, as fully as the fact of the earth's revolution about the sun."{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}
*[[Richard Dawkins]] says, "One thing all real scientists agree upon is the fact of evolution itself. It is a fact that we are cousins of gorillas, kangaroos, starfish, and bacteria. Evolution is as much a fact as the heat of the sun. It is not a theory, and for pity's sake, let's stop confusing the philosophically naive by calling it so. Evolution is a fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |date=December 2005 |title=The Illusion of Design |url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/1105/1105_feature1.html |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |location=Research Triangle Park, NC |publisher=Natural History Magazine, Inc. |volume=114 |issue=9 |pages=35–37 |accessdate=2015-01-19 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Neil Campbell (scientist)|Neil Campbell]] wrote in his 1990 biology textbook, "Today, nearly all biologists acknowledge that evolution is a fact. The term theory is no longer appropriate except when referring to the various models that attempt to explain how life evolves... it is important to understand that the current questions about how life evolves in no way implies any disagreement over the fact of evolution."{{sfn|Campbell|1990|p=434}}

===Evolution as a collection of theories ''not'' fact===
Evolutionary biologist [[Kirk J. Fitzhugh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhm.org/site/research-collections/polychaetous-annelids/research-studies |title=Recent Research by J. Kirk Fitzhugh, Ph.D. |website=Polychaetous Annelids Research Studies |publisher=[[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] |location=Los Angeles, CA |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that scientists must be cautious to "carefully and correctly" describe the nature of scientific investigation at a time when evolutionary biology is under attack from creationists and proponents of intelligent design. Fitzhugh writes that while facts are states of being in nature, theories represent efforts to connect those states of being by causal relationships:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{"'}}Evolution' cannot be both a theory and a fact. Theories are concepts stating cause–effect relations. Regardless of one's certainty as to the utility of a theory to provide understanding, it would be epistemically incorrect to assert any theory as also being a fact, given that theories are not objects to be discerned by their state of being."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fitzhugh recognizes that the "theory" versus "fact" debate is one of semantics. He nevertheless contends that referring to evolution as a "fact" is technically incorrect and distracts from the primary "goal of science, which is to continually acquire causal understanding through the critical evaluation of our theories and hypotheses." Fitzhugh concludes that the "certainty" of evolution "provides no basis for elevating any evolutionary theory or hypothesis to the level of fact."&lt;ref name="fitzhugh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitzhugh|first1=Kirk|title=Fact, theory, test and evolution|department=Letter to the Editor|journal=Zoologica Scripta|date=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1463-6409.2007.00308.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.nsta.org/publications/press/stopfakingit.aspx Dr William C. Robertson] writing for National Science Teachers Association writes, "I have heard too many scientists claim that evolution is a fact, often in retort to the claim that it is just a theory. Evolution isn’t a fact. Rather than claiming so, I think scientists would be better served to agree that evolution is a theory and then proceed to explain what a theory is -- a coherent explanation that undergoes constant testing and often revision over a period of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=roIk6e6yKEEC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=I+have+heard+too+many+scientists+claim+that+evolution+is+a+fact,+often+in+retort+to+the+claim+that+it+is+just+a+theory.+Evolution+isn%E2%80%99t+a+fact.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iTi-EVUsUu&amp;sig=kvJgmQx6NUfoEpFJMI6BDlDTStg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1stWaitnPAhWMWj4KHSBmB2kQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20have%20heard%20too%20many%20scientists%20claim%20that%20evolution%20is%20a%20fact,%20often%20in%20retort%20to%20the%20claim%20that%20it%20is%20just%20a%20theory.%20Evolution%20isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20fact.&amp;f=false|title=Answers to Science Questions from the Stop Faking It!

*"Proof" of a theory has different meanings in science. Proof exists in [[formal science]]s, such as a [[mathematical proof]] where symbolic expressions can represent [[infinite set]]s and scientific laws having precise definitions and outcomes of the terms.

The '''extinction risk of global warming''' is the risk of [[species]] becoming [[Extinction|extinct]] due to the [[effects of global warming]]. This may be Earth's [[Mass Extinction|sixth major extinction]], often called the [[Anthropocene]] or [[Holocene extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Current projections==
The scientific consensus in the 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] is that {{Quotation|"Anthropogenic warming could lead to some impacts that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change."
"There is medium confidence that approximately 20-30% of species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average warming exceed 1.5-2.5 °C (relative to 1980-1999). As global average temperature increase exceeds about 3.5 °C, model projections suggest significant extinctions (40-70% of species assessed) around the globe."}}

In one study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2004, between 15 and 37% of 1103 endemic or near-endemic known plant and animal species will be "committed to extinction" by 2050.&lt;ref name=Thomas2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomas, C.D. |author2=Cameron, A. |author3=Green, R.E. |author4=Bakkenes, M. |author5=Beaumont, L.J. |author6=Collingham, Y.C. |author7=Erasmus, B.F.N. |author8=Siqueira, M.F.D. |author9=Grainger, A. |author10= Hannah, L.  | year = 2004 | title = Extinction risk from climate change | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 427 | issue = 6970 | pages = 145–148 | doi= 10.1038/nature02121 | url = http://www.mnp.nl/bibliotheek/digitaaldepot/20040108nature.pdf  |format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | accessdate = 2008-04-15 | pmid = 14712274|bibcode = 2004Natur.427..145T }}&lt;/ref&gt; More properly, changes in habitat by 2050 will put them outside the survival range for the inhabitants, thus committing the species to extinction.

In 2008, the [[Lemur-like Ringtail Possum|white lemuroid possum]] was reported to be the first known [[mammal]] species to be driven extinct by man-made [[global warming]]. However, these reports were based on a misunderstanding. One population of these possums in the mountain forests of [[North Queensland|northern Queensland]] is severely threatened by climate change as the animals cannot survive extended temperatures over 30&amp;nbsp;°C. However, another population 100 kilometres south remains in good health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16875 Rumours of possum's death were greatly exaggerated] March 31, 2009 [[New Scientist]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research published in the January 4, 2012 ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]'' current climate models may be flawed because they overlook two important factors: the differences in how quickly species relocate and competition among species. According to the researchers, led by [[Mark C. Urban]], an ecologist at the University of Connecticut, diversity decreased when they took these factors into account, and that new communities of organisms, which do not exist today, emerged. As a result the rate of extinctions may be higher than previously projected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2012/0106/Climate-change-models-flawed-extinction-rate-likely-higher-than-predicted|title=Climate change models flawed, extinction rate likely higher than predicted|date= January 6, 2012 |publisher=[[csmonitor.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research published in the 30 May 2014 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]],'' most known species have small ranges, and the numbers of small-ranged species are increasing quickly. They are geographically concentrated and are disproportionately likely to be threatened or already extinct. According to the research, current rates of extinction are three orders of magnitude higher than the [[background extinction rate]], and future rates, which depend on many factors, are poised to increase. Although there has been rapid progress in developing protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically representative, nor do they optimally protect biodiversity. In the researchers' view, human activity tends to destroy critical habitats where species live, warms the planet, and tends to move species around the planet to places where they don’t belong and where they can come into conflict with human needs (e.g. causing species to become pests).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pimm | first1 = S.

The term pixel '''fillrate'''  refers to the number of pixels a [[video card]] can render to screen and write to video memory in a [[second]] or in case of texture fillrate the number of texture map elements (texels) GPU can map to pixels in a [[second]].&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/1747-what-is-texture-fill-rate-defined|title=What is the "Texture Fill-Rate" on a GPU and Does it Matter?|last=Burke|first=Steve|date=27 December 2014|work=Gamers Nexus|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pixel fillrates are given in [[megapixels]] per second or in [[gigapixels]] per second (in the case of newer cards), and they are obtained by multiplying the number of Raster Output Units (ROPs) by the clock frequency of the graphics processor unit ([[GPU]]) of a [[video card]] and texture fillrate is obtained by multiplying the number of Texture Mapping Units (TMUs) by the clock frequency of the graphics processing unit (GPU). Texture fillrates are given in mega or gigatexels per second. However, there is no full agreement on how to calculate and report fillrates. Other possible method is: to multiply the number of pixel pipelines by the clock frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The results of these multiplications correspond to a theoretical number. The actual fillrate depends on many other factors. In the past, the fillrate has been used as an indicator of performance by video card manufacturers such as [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] and [[NVIDIA]], however, the importance of the fillrate as a measurement of performance has declined as the bottleneck in graphics applications has shifted. For example, today, the number and speed of [[unified shader]] processing units has gained attention.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpureview.com/pixel-fill-rate-article-365.html|title=Pixel Fill Rate|last=Thomas|first=Michael|date=2 June 2006|work=GPUReview.com|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scene complexity can be increased by overdrawing, which happens when "an object is drawn to the frame buffer, and then another object (such as a wall) is drawn on top of it, covering it up.

{{Paleontology}}

'''Fossil wood''' is [[wood]] that is preserved in the [[fossil record]].  Over time the wood will usually be the part of a plant that is best preserved (and most easily found).  Fossil wood may or may not be [[petrified wood|petrified]]. The study of fossil wood is sometimes called palaeoxylology, with a "palaeoxylologist" somebody who studies fossil wood.

The fossil wood may be the only part of the plant that has been preserved, with the rest of the plant completely unknown:&lt;ref name="strauss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edstrauss.com/pwoodfx.html |title=Petrified Wood from Western Washington |author=Ed Strauss |year=2001 |accessdate=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211224655/http://www.edstrauss.com/pwoodfx.html |archivedate=December 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore such wood may get a special kind of [[botanical name]]. This will usually include "xylon" and a term indicating its presumed affinity, such as ''[[Araucarioxylon arizonicum|Araucarioxylon]]'' (wood of ''[[Araucaria]]'' or some related genus), ''[[Palmoxylon]]'' (wood of an indeterminate [[Arecaceae|palm]]), or ''Castanoxylon'' (wood of an indeterminate [[Castanopsis|chinkapin]]).&lt;ref name="stewart"&gt;{{cite book

==Types==

===Petrified wood===
{{Main|Petrified wood}}
Petrified wood are fossils of wood that have turned to stone through the process of [[permineralization]]. All organic materials are replaced with minerals while maintaining the original structure of the wood.

The most notable example is the [[Petrified Forest National Park|petrified forest]] in [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mummified wood===
Mummified wood are fossils of wood that have not permineralized.&lt;ref name="strauss2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/blog/posting.asp?ID=414 |title=Mummified Forest Shows Effect of Changing Climate |author=Kelly Greig |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 8, 2011 |publisher=Canadian Geographic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205052304/http://canadiangeographic.ca/blog/posting.asp?ID=414 |archivedate=February 5, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are formed when trees are buried rapidly in dry cold or hot environments. They are valued in paleobotany because they retain original cells and tissues capable of being examined with the same techniques used with extant plants in [[dendrology]].&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite book

'''Genetic use restriction technology''' ('''GURT'''), also known as '''terminator technology''' or '''suicide seeds''', is the name given to proposed methods for restricting the use of [[genetically modified food|genetically modified plants]] by activating some genes only in response to certain stimuli, in particular to cause second generation seeds to be infertile.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A.|first=Jefferson, Richard|last2=Don|first2=Byth,|last3=Carlos|first3=Correa,|last4=Gerardo|first4=Otero,|last5=Calvin|first5=Qualset,|date=1999-04-30|title=Genetic use restriction technologies|url=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1477499|journal=Zenodo|language=en|doi=10.5281/zenodo.1477499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edepot.wur.nl/39033 Retrieved October 18 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The technology was originally developed under a cooperative research and development agreement between the [[Agricultural Research Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] and Delta and Pine Land company in the 1990s, but it is not yet commercially available.&lt;ref name="ISF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldseed.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Genetic_Use_Restriction_Technologies_20030611_En1.pdf |author=www.worldseed.org, International Seed Federation|title=Genetic Use Restriction Technologies (Bangalore, June 2003)}} (Position Paper Supporting V-GURT development)&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology was first reported on by the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) to the UN [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and discussed during the 8th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] in [[Curitiba]], Brazil, March 20–31, 2006.

== Process ==
[[File:GURT process diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.5|One type of GURT process uses biological signals to directly make certain enzymes.]]

Because of the continued development of the technology and the nature of patents that develop it, most descriptions of GURT differ from others. Still, all GURTs feature similar processes.&lt;ref name="GURT use"/&gt; The process is typically composed of four genetic components: a target gene, a promoter, a trait switch, and a genetic switch, sometimes with slightly different names in different papers. 

In one variation, a plant with GURT technology has in its [[DNA]] a target gene separated from a certain promoter gene by a blocker sequence. When a chosen external input is received by the plant, a genetic switch in the plant takes the input, amplifies it, and converts it into a biological signal. Next, the trait switch receives the signal and creates an [[enzyme]] that cuts the blocker sequence out. When the blocker sequence is eliminated, the promoter gene is able to cause the target gene to express itself in the plant.&lt;ref name="GURT use"&gt; Yi Sang Reginald J. Millwood C. Neal Stewart Jr. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pbi.12084 "Gene use restriction technologies for transgenic plant bioconfinement"] 04 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biofortified.org/2015/12/gmos-and-patents-part-1-terminator-genes/ Retrieved 19 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different version of the technology, an operator must bind to the trait switch in order for it to make the enzymes that cut out the blocker sequence. However, there are repressors that bind to the trait switch and prevent it from doing so. In this case, when the external input is applied, the repressors bond to it instead of the trait switch, allowing for the enzymes to be created that cut the blocker sequence, and the trait is expressed.&lt;ref name="GURT review"&gt;Luca Lombardo. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/pbi.12242 "Genetic use restriction technologies: a review"] 17 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Other variations of GURT range widely, including systems such as letting the genetic switch directly affect the blocker sequence and bypass the need for a trait switch.&lt;ref name="GURT review"/&gt;

== Variants ==
There are conceptually two types of GURT.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Heffer. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y2722e/y2722e1f.htm#fn1 Biotechnology: a modern tool for food production improvement] in Seed Policy and Programmes for the Central and Eastern European Countries, Commonwealth of Independent States and Other Countries in Transition. FAO Plant Production and Protection Paper 168.  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jefferson&gt;Jefferson RA et al. [http://www.patentlens.net/daisy/patentlens/552/version/default/part/AttachmentData/data/GURT.pdf Genetic Use Restriction Technologies]: Technical Assessment of the Set of New Technologies which Sterilize or Reduce the Agronomic Value of Second Generation Seed, as Exemplified by U.S. Patent No. 5,723,765, and WO 94/03619.  Expert paper, prepared for the Secretariat on 30 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; V-GURTs were developed first, with patents ranging throughout the 1990s, while T-GURTS were developed later and are sometimes considered the second generation of V-GURTS.&lt;ref name="GURT review"/&gt; The differences between the two types of GURT mainly rely on what the target gene does when it is activated.

=== Variety specific ===
Variety specific genetic use restriction technologies (V-GURT) produce sterile seeds, so the seed from the crop could not be used as seeds, but only for sale as food or fodder.&lt;ref name="ISF" /&gt; When a plant reaches a given reproductive stage in its cycle, the process of activating the target gene begins. In V-GURTs, the target gene is known as a disrupter gene, and is usually a [[cytotoxin]] that degrades the DNA or [[RNA]] of the plant. This results in a non-functioning seed that cannot grow into a plant.&lt;ref name="GURT use"/&gt; V-GURTs would not have an immediate impact on the large number of primarily western farmers who use [[hybrid seed]]s, as they do not produce their own planting seeds, and instead buy specialized hybrid seeds from seed production companies. However, currently around 80 percent of farmers in both Brazil and Pakistan grow crops based on saved seeds from previous harvests.&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"&gt;Haider Rizvi, [http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/03/biodiversity-dont-sell-suicide-seeds-activists-warn/ "BIODIVERSITY: Don't Sell "Suicide Seeds", Activists Warn"], Inter Press Service News Agency, March 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Consequentially, resistance to the introduction of GURT technology into developing countries is strong.&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net" /&gt; The technology is restricted at the plant variety level, hence the term V-GURT.

=== Trait specific ===
Trait specific genetic use restriction technologies (T-GURT) are a second type of GURT that would modify a crop in such a way that the genetic enhancement engineered into the crop does not function until the plant is treated with a specific chemical.&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/plants/plants-with-novel-traits/general-public/gurts/eng/1337406710213/1337406801948 |title= Genetic Use Restriction Technologies (GURTs)}} Retrieved October 17 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISF" /&gt; The chemical acts as the external input, activating the target gene. One difference in T-GURTs is the possibility that the gene could be toggled on and off with different chemical inputs, resulting in the same toggling on or off an associated trait. With T-GURTs, seeds could possibly be saved for planting with a condition that the new plants do not get any enhanced traits unless the external input is added. The technology is restricted at the trait level, hence the term T-GURT.

==Potential uses==
There are several proposed uses for GURTs that could benefit both businesses and farms. 

Non-viable seeds produced on V-GURT plants may reduce the propagation of [[Volunteer (botany)|volunteer plants]]. Volunteer plants can become an economic problem for larger-scale mechanized farming systems that incorporate [[crop rotation]].&lt;ref name="ISF"/&gt; Furthermore, under warm, wet [[harvest]] conditions non V-GURT grain can sprout, lowering the quality of grain produced. It is likely that this problem would not occur with the use of V-GURT grain varieties.&lt;ref name="ISF"/&gt; Use of V-GURT technology could also prevent escape of [[transgene]]s into wild relatives and help lessen impacts on [[biodiversity]]. Crops modified to produce non-food products could be armed with GURT technology to prevent accidental transmission of these traits into crops meant for foods.&lt;ref name="ISF"/&gt;

One of the original proposed uses for GURTs was to use them as alternatives to keep farmers from reusing patented seeds in the case that typical biological patents do not exist or are not enforced.&lt;ref name="ISF"/&gt; The use of T-GURTs by companies has been proposed to allow for the selling of a traditional seed that gets special functions only when sprayed with a certain activator chemical sold by the company.&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt;

==Controversy==
As of 2006, GURT seeds have not been commercialized anywhere in the world due to opposition from farmers, consumers, [[indigenous peoples]], [[Non-Governmental Organization|NGOs]], and some governments. Using the technology, companies that manufacture genetic use restriction technologies could potentially be able to make much more revenue because the seeds sold would not be able to be resown. Another concern is that farmers purchasing the seeds would be greatly impacted, given that would have to buy new seeds every year. It has been argued that this would result in higher prices in food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethique.gouv.qc.ca/en/assets/documents/OGM/TRUG/TRUG-avis-EN.pdf|title=An Ethical Examination of Genetic Use Restriction Technologies|date=November 20, 2008|access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; GURT seeds are worried to cause a significant decrease in biodiversity and threaten native species of plants.&lt;ref&gt;https://intercontinentalcry.org/women-are-on-the-frontlines-of-a-race-against-time-to-save-native-seeds/ Retrieved October 17 2018&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents of the technology dispute these claims, making the cases that because non-GMO hybrid plants are used in the same way and GURT seeds could help farmers deal with cross pollination, the benefits outweigh the potential negatives.&lt;ref&gt;https://fafdl.org/gmobb/the-myth-and-reality-of-terminator-seeds/ Retrieved October 17 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity recommended a ''de facto'' [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on field-testing and commercial sale of terminator seeds; the moratorium was re-affirmed and the language strengthened in March 2006, at the COP8 meeting of the UNCBD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banterminator.org/Glossary/Moratorium |title=Moratorium |publisher=Ban Terminator |accessdate=12 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216165017/http://www.banterminator.org/Glossary/Moratorium |archivedate=16 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the moratorium recommended that, due to a lack of research on the technology's potential risks, no field testing of GURTs nor products using them should be allowed until there was a sufficiently justified reason to do so. [[India]] and [[Brazil]] have passed national laws to prohibit the technology.&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"/&gt;

'''Guerrilla crosswalks''' are created by modifying existing [[pedestrian crossing]] or painting new crosswalk lines. This is done without jurisdictional approval and with the intent of improving pedestrian and other non-automobile safety. These interventions are a common strategy within [[tactical urbanism]], a term used to describe any low-cost, often temporary change to the built environment intended to improve local livability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfeifer|first=Laura|date=October 23, 2014|title=The Planner's Guide to Tactical Urbanism|url=https://reginaurbanecology.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tuguide1.pdf|journal=Regina Urban Ecology|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}{{sps|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guerilla crosswalks have been noted in news articles since at least 2009 and have become more well known as an urban strategy in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bikeportland.org/2009/12/28/guerrila-crosswalk-installed-on-east-burnside-27521|title=Guerilla Crosswalk painted on East Burnside|last=Maus|first=Jonathan|date=December 28, 2009|website=|publisher=BikePortland.org|access-date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Walkability]] and [[quality of life]] indicators are common topics in urban planners' and urban advocates' vocabulary in recent years. With the increasing body of research focused on measuring, and in some cases, marketing the walkability and quality of life in cities, citizens and decision-makers alike are focused on improving intersections, sidewalks, and streetscapes. Tactical urbanism is focused generally on small-scale, quick, and low-cost changes to a place. While some might consider it illegal, it is utilized by both activists and city planners alike when pilot programs and improvements are required immediately and when budget is a significant constraint. 

Many guerrilla tactics react to the delays and inefficiencies in attempting to follow proper or legal channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pagano|first=Celeste|date=2013|title=DIY Urbanism: Property and Process in grassroots city building|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5192&amp;context=mulr|journal=Marquette Law Review|volume=97|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=September 2, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when local residents appeal to a public works department for an additional crosswalk near a school, impatience will inevitably set in after a time of unresponsiveness. Sometimes an act such as painting an unsanctioned [[Crosswalks|crosswalk]] is the only response that will move some jurisdictions to action. Many activists are frustrated with their local street system. Whether they are pedestrians or cyclists, in many cases, they are concerned about traffic speeds and safety around the ever increasing number of cars on the roads. Others simply want safer intersections near their children's schools. Whatever the motivation, guerrilla crosswalks are a strategic response by those unsatisfied with existing conditions.

Although this tactic appears to respond to unsafe conditions at the interface of pedestrian and automobile circulation, it is not without its opponents. One Public Works official commented in this way, "These changes to City streets are illegal, potentially unsafe and adding to the City's costs of maintenance and repair…. There is potential liability and risk management claims to both the City and the individuals involved."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Painting your own crosswalk: crime or civic opportunity?|last=Goodyear|first=Sarah|date=June 5, 2013|url=http://www.citylab.com/commute/2013/06/painting-your-own-crosswalk-crime-or-civic-opportunity/5791/ |publisher=Atlantic: Citylab|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosswalks are a signal to drivers that pedestrians may be present. They are intended to group pedestrians for crossing at a safe time. The introduction of new crosswalks can be confusing to drivers and potentially give pedestrians a false sense of security. 

==Etymology==
The Oxford English Dictionary's definition of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] includes: "referring to actions or activities performed in an impromptu way, often without authorization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tactical Urbanism|last=Lydon|first=Mike|last2=Garcia|first2=Anthony|publisher=Island Press|year=2015|isbn=9781610915670|location=|pages=13|via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkW9BgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Tactical+Urbanism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipuqP8--TPAhVcGGMKHTK1AAgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Guerilla%20crosswalks&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Case studies and examples==

In the Baltimore neighborhood known as Hampden, a 2011 repaving project endured longer than planned. After paving was complete, new crosswalks should have been painted, but the task was left undone with the contractor's justification that the cold weather prevented any street striping. This busy intersection was determined unsafe by many of the locals. Eventually one resident took it upon himself to take action. As he painted the crosswalk lines late into the night, he noticed that cops passed by but no citation was ever given. The local city council woman rather than pursue some level of prosecution actually offered a hearty "thank you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampden's DIY Crosswalks|date=September 10, 2013|publisher=North Baltimore Patch|last1=Bednar|first1=Adam|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Honolulu]], Hawaii has some of the highest pedestrian fatality rates in the United States. (Wong 2012)  Many of their busiest intersections reflect city standards from years past without modification as the quantity of vehicular traffic and associated speeds have changed dramatically. Some residents chose to take a stand in 2014. Within the crosswalk of one of these busy intersections, residents altered the crosswalk lines so that they spelled out "Aloha," the traditional Hawaiian salutation. While the perpetrators sought to introduce a level of humanity to the dangerous location, city officials stated that the change was a "deviation from the standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=February 2014|publisher=StrongTowns blog|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[Chicago]] has seen a different level of activism to protect pedestrians within an existing crosswalk. In Spring of 2016, the city of Chicago posted signage to a unique intersection: no left turn. To call attention to this new condition, an unknown person installed two small planter boxes within the crosswalk with flowering plants. Many responded positively while local businesses expressed concern for the traffic pattern change and its effect on their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eyes on the Street: Tactical Urbanism Blooms on Broadway|date=April 21, 2016|publisher=StreetsBlog Chicago|last1=Greenfield|first1=John|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Project Physics Text cover.jpg|thumb|''Project Physics'', cover, main text]]
'''Harvard Project Physics''', also called '''Project Physics''', was a national [[curriculum development]] project to create a [[secondary school]] [[physics education]] program in the United States during the [[Cold War]] era. 

==History==
The project was active from 1962 to 1972, and produced the ''Project Physics'' series of texts, which were used in physics classrooms in the 1970s and 1980s. The project was centered at [[Harvard University]], but drew from schools and educators from across the country. The directors of this project were: [[F. James Rutherford]], project coordinator (and after completion of the project, professor of [[science education]] at [[New York University]]); [[Gerald Holton]], professor of physics and of the [[history of science]] at Harvard University; and [[Fletcher Watson|Fletcher G. Watson]], professor of science education at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]].

==Course materials==
Project Physics course work was broken into six main subject areas, organized into separate books each called a "Project Physics Text and Handbook" or "Student Guide":&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/projectphysicscollection Project Physics Collection at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

#Concepts of Motion
#Motion in the Heavens
#The Triumph of Mechanics
#Light and Electromagnetism
#Models of the Atom 
#The Nucleus

The books presented the material from a historical perspective, with aspects of human interest wrapped into the text. The intent was to build a sophisticated conceptual understanding of physics, while not over-simplifying the curriculum. Frequent references to historical works where concepts were first discovered and debated highlighted the drive to make physics a fundamental search for understanding of the universe.&lt;ref name="AOTS"&gt;{{cite web|title=High School Reform Projects: Physics|url=http://artofteachingscience.org/mos/5.2.html|website=artofteachingscience.org|accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course materials also included readers, tests, and other teaching aids. The course readers allowed students to further explore a topic, and lab exercises enabled students to verify that their understanding was confirmed by experimental outcomes. Special lab equipment, brief film loops, films, and a teacher's guide were also developed.&lt;ref name="AOTS" /&gt; The texts and all other aids are now available for free on the Project Physics Collection web site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)''' was initiated in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers - ASHRAE: "[http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/ashrae/ashraeinsights_201408/ ASHRAE Insights, August 2014]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Lyons Hardcastle, "[http://www.environmentalleader.com/2014/07/11/indoor-environmental-quality-alliance-formed/ Indoor Environmental Quality Alliance Formed]", Environmental Leader, July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Governo Law Firm, "Newly Formed Alliance: Premier Resource for Indoor Environmental Quality", July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to improve the actual, delivered indoor environmental quality in buildings through coordination, education, outreach and advocacy. The alliance works to supply information, guidelines and knowledge on the [[Building science|indoor environmental quality (IEQ)]] in buildings and workplaces,&lt;ref&gt;BUILD UP energy solutions for better buildings, "[http://www.buildup.eu/news/41608 International Societies form Indoor Environmental Quality – Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)]", 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and to provide occupants in buildings and workplaces with an acceptable indoor environmental quality (([[indoor air quality]] (IAQ), thermal conditions, visual quality, and acoustical quality)) and help promote implementation in practice of knowledge from research on the field.

The group has already begun work to collect and critique IEQ standards and is organising and presenting programmes at the conferences of member organisations&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE: "[http://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/products/1899131#jumps SEMINAR 8 Indoor environmental quality: a global and holistic perspective, part 1]", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE: "[http://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/products/1899132#jumps SEMINAR 8 Indoor environmental quality: a global and holistic perspective, part 2]", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre - AIVC]]: "[http://www.aivc.org/news/indoor-environmental-quality-global-alliance-first-sessions-june-2015-ashrae-annual-conference Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance first sessions at the June 2015 ASHRAE Annual conference]", September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre - AIVC]], "[http://www.aivc.org/sites/default/files/36-AIVC-program.pdf 36th AIVC Conference Programme]", September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

The Alliance was officially launched on June 29, 2014 during [[ASHRAE]]’s 2014 Annual Conference in [[Seattle]]; a [[memorandum of understanding]] was signed and the Alliance was formed.&lt;ref&gt;[[venticool]]: "[http://venticool.eu/international-societies-form-indoor-environmental-quality-global-alliance-ieq-ga/ International Societies form Indoor Environmental Quality – Global Alliance] (IEQ-GA)", 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill Bahnfleth, ASHRAE’s 2013-2014 president, appointed an ad-hoc committee to look at ways for industry groups to cooperate and address aspects of indoor environmental quality and health.&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE: "[https://www.ashrae.org/communities/indoor-environmental-quality-global-alliance-ieq-ga Indoor Environmental Quality--Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)]", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partners and governmental organisations ==
Founding members of the Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance include organisations that broadly deal with the indoor environments as well as those specialised primarily in [[Indoor Air Quality]](IAQ). 
The Alliance’s current partners include the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the [[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre]] (AIVC), [[ASHRAE|the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)]] the Air &amp; Waste Management Association (A&amp;WMA), the Indoor Air Quality Association (IAQA), and the Federation of European Heating and Air-Conditioning Associations ([https://www.rehva.eu/ REHVA]) &lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE, "[https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Communities/Memoranda%20of%20Understanding/IEQ-GA-MOU.pdf Memorandum of Understanding- Indoor Environmental Quality – Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)]", Retrieved August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. The Alliance is also supported by governmental organisations such as the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE): "[http://www.cibsejournal.com/archive/PDFs/CIBSE-Journal-2014-08.pdf Industry seeks to redress IAQ balance]", CIBSE Journal August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integrated landscape management''' is a way of managing a landscape that brings together multiple stakeholders, who collaborate to integrate policy and practice for their different land use objectives, with the purpose of achieving sustainable landscapes.&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;

Integrated landscape management is one approach to addressing the major global challenges of [[poverty]], [[food security]], [[climate change]], [[water scarcity]], [[deforestation]] and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] at the local level. Proponents of integrated landscape management argue that as these challenges are interconnected, coordinated approaches are needed to address them, in order for landscapes (heterogenous geographic areas) to generate multiple benefits. For example, one river basin can supply water for towns and agriculture, timber and food crops for smallholders and industry, and habitat for biodiversity; the way in which each one of these sectors pursues its goals can have impacts on the others.&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=A K|last2=McMichael|first2=P|last3=Milder|first3=J C|last4=Scherr|first4=S J|title=Multi-functional landscapes from the grassroots? The role of rural producer movements|journal=Agriculture and Human Values|date=2015|volume=33|issue=2|pages=305–322|doi=10.1007/s10460-015-9611-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The integrated approach goes beyond traditional sector-based practices that manage these different land uses independently of each other, even where they depend on the same resource base.&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; The intention is to manage landscapes in a joined-up way, so that society's needs can be met in the short term, and in the long term.&lt;ref name="SDG briefing"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landscapes for People Food and Nature|title=Integrated Landscape Management: The Means of Implementation for the Sustainable Development Goals|journal=Landscapes for People Food and Nature briefing|date=2015|url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ILM-for-the-SDGs-Two-Page-Statement-Sept-21-2015-FINAL-FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated landscape management is increasingly recognised and taken up by intergovernmental bodies,&lt;ref name="SBSTTA report" /&gt; government initiatives,&lt;ref name="GMS BLL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IINDC" /&gt; research institutes,&lt;ref name="CIFOR landscapes pg" /&gt; and some of the world's largest conservation NGOs,&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; resulting in an increase in the number of examples of the approach in practice. However, barriers to uptake include difficulties in monitoring integrated landscape management and the proliferation of definitions and terms relating to it.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;

== Development and uptake of the approach ==
Efforts to develop and implement concepts that integrate social and economic development, and biodiversity conservation are not new.  Integrated landscape management has evolved through multiple iterations and alongside other concepts&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=J|last2=Deakin|first2=E|last3=Sunderland|first3=T|title=What are ‘Integrated Landscape Approaches’ and how effectively have they been implemented in the tropics: a systematic map protocol|journal=Environmental Evidence|date=2015|volume=4:2|url=http://www.cifor.org/library/5422/what-are-integrated-landscape-approaches-and-how-effectively-have-they-been-implemented-in-the-tropics-a-systematic-map-protocol/|issn=2047-2382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="learning"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=J|last2=Van Vianen|first2=J|last3=Deakin|first3=E L|last4=Barlow|first4=J|last5=Sunderland|first5=T|title=Integrated landscape approaches to managing social and environmental issues in the tropics: learning from the past to guide the future|journal=Global Change Biology|date=2016|doi=10.1111/gcb.13284|volume=22|pages=2540–2554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scherr"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scherr|first1=S J|last2=Shames|first2=S|last3=Friedman|first3=R|title=Defining Integrated Landscape Management for Policy Makers|journal=Ecoagriculture Policy Focus|date=2013|issue=10|url=http://ecoagriculture.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DefiningILMforPolicyMakers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minang"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Minang|first1=P A|last2=van Noordwijk|first2=M|last3=Freeman|first3=O E|last4=Mbow|first4=C|last5=de Leeuw|first5=J|last6=Catacutan|first6=D|title=Climate-Smart Landscapes: Multifunctionality In Practice|date=2015|publisher=World Agroforestry Center (ICRAF)|location=Nairobi, Kenya}}&lt;/ref&gt; – from [[watershed management]] to [[landscape ecology]]&lt;ref name="Sayer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sayer|first1=J|title=Reconciling conservation and development: are landscapes the answer?|journal=Biotropica|date=2009|volume=41|issue=6|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00575.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00575.x/abstract|pages=649–652}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[landscape-scale conservation]] to indigenous biocultural territorial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indigenous Biocultural Territories|url=http://www.biocultural.iied.org/indigenous-biocultural-territories|publisher=IIED}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has much in common with the concept of the water-energy-food nexus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water, Food and Energy Nexus|url=http://www.unwater.org/topics/water-food-and-energy-nexus/en/|publisher=UN Water}}&lt;/ref&gt; and draws on the [[ecosystem approach]] (the primary framework for action under the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecosystem Approach Introduction|url=https://www.cbd.int/ecosystem/|publisher=CBD}}&lt;/ref&gt;). There are particular parallels with ‘climate-smart agriculture', which also aims for landscapes to provide multiple benefits in terms of food security, rural livelihoods, and climate change adaptation and mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=FAO|title="Climate-Smart" Agriculture: Policies, Practices and Financing for Food Security, Adaptation and Mitigation|date=2010|publisher=FAO|location=Rome, Italy|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1881e/i1881e00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest in landscape approaches has increased in recognition of the connections between the global challenges of [[poverty]], [[food security]], [[climate change]], [[water scarcity]], [[deforestation]] and loss of [[biodiversity]]. For example, lifting people out of poverty can increase consumption and drive climate change;&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stern|first1=N|title=The Economics of Climate Change: the Stern Review|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing agricultural production can exacerbate water scarcity and drive habitat loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tilman|first1=D|title=Global environmental impacts of agricultural expansion: the need for sustainable and efficient practices|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA|volume=96|pages=5995–6000|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/96/11/5995.full|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.11.5995|pmid=10339530|pmc=34218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laurance|first1=W F|last2=Sayer|first2=J|last3=Cassman|first3=KG|title=Agricultural expansion and its impacts on tropical nature|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=2014|volume=29|pages=107–116|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534713002929|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2013.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated landscape management has been adopted at the intergovernmental level by the [[UN Environment Programme]], which states that "UNEP champions the landscape approach de facto as it embodies the main elements of integrated ecosystem management"; UNEP puts the approach into practice through a  multinational project of Ecosystem Management of Productive Landscapes.&lt;ref name="UNEPEMPL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecosystems Management of Productive Landscapes|url=https://unepempl.wordpress.com/about/|publisher=UN Environment Programme (UNEP)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] also recognises the approach: its scientific committee has compiled information on improving sustainable use of biodiversity in a landscape perspective, and stated that "As sustainability can only be achieved at an appropriate spatial and temporal context, the landscape level is arguably the most important spatial scale to improve and assess the sustainable management of agricultural and forest ecosystems.".&lt;ref name="SBSTTA report"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Convention on Biological Diversity|first1=SBSTTA|title=Report on how to improve sustainable use of biodiversity in a landscape perspective (UNEP/CBD/SBSTTA/15/13)|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/sbstta/sbstta-15/official/sbstta-15-13-en.pdf|website=Convention on Biological Diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape approaches are also being taken up by national governments (for example, to inform international cooperation for the Greater Mekong Subregion,&lt;ref name="GMS BLL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversity Landscapes and Livelihoods|url=http://www.gms-eoc.org/biodiversity-conservation-corridors-initiative|website=Greater Mekong Subregion - Core Environment Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GMS Workshop on Landscape Approaches|url=http://www.gms-eoc.org/events/gms-workshop-on-landscape-approaches|website=Greater Mekong Subregion - Core Environment Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a foundational principle of Indonesia's climate change commitments&lt;ref name="IINDC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Republic of Indonesia|title=Intended Nationally Determined Contribution|url=http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Indonesia/1/INDC_REPUBLIC%20OF%20INDONESIA.pdf|website=UNFCCC submissions}}&lt;/ref&gt;); by international research bodies (for example, the [[Center for International Forestry Research]],&lt;ref name="CIFOR landscapes pg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR)|url=http://www.cifor.org/sustainable-landscapes/|website=Sustainable Landscapes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which convenes the Global Landscapes Forum&lt;ref name="GLF homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landscapes.org/|website=Global Landscapes Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;); and conservation NGOs (for example, the [[Worldwide Fund for Nature]], Global Canopy Programme, [[The Nature Conservancy]], IDH - The Sustainable Trade Initiative, and EcoAgriculture Partners, which collaborated on a book on integrated landscape management&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;).

== Definitions ==
A plethora of overlapping ideas and definitions have emerged,&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forestsnews.cifor.org/23834/landscape-approach-defies-simple-definition-and-thats-good?fnl=en|title=‘Landscape approach’ defies simple definition — and that’s good|date=2014-08-27|work=CIFOR Forests News|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining landscapes, landscape management, and landscape approaches from the perspectives of different fields (see alternative definitions under [[landscape ecology]], for example). Despite differences in definitions, many terms can be seen as entry points for landscape approaches.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Minang" /&gt; One set of definitions (developed by a consortium of research groups and NGOs&lt;ref name="LSLB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denier|first1=L|last2=Scherr|first2=S|last3=Shames|first3=S|last4=Chatterton|first4=P|last5=Hovani|first5=L|last6=Stam|first6=N|title=The Little Sustainable Landscapes Book|date=2015|publisher=Global Canopy Programme|location=Oxford|url=http://globalcanopy.org/sustainablelandscapes}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that aims to create a stepwise progression through landscapes, sustainable landscapes, integrated landscape management and landscape approaches is as follows:

"A landscape is a [[socio-ecological system]] that consists of natural and/or human-modified ecosystems, and which is influenced by distinct ecological, historical, economic and socio-cultural processes and activities."&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

"A sustainable landscape helps to meet the principles of sustainable development as defined in the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. These are landscapes that can meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

"Integrated landscape management is a way of managing the landscape that involves collaboration among multiple stakeholders, with the purpose of achieving sustainable landscapes."

"The governance structure, size and scope, and number and type of stakeholders involved (private sector, civil society, government) can vary. The level of cooperation also varies, from information sharing and consultation, to more formal models with shared decision-making and joint implementation."&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

"A landscape approach is a conceptual framework whereby stakeholders in a landscape aim to reconcile competing social, economic and environmental objectives. It seeks to move away from the often-unsustainable sectoral approach to land management. A landscape approach aims to ensure the realisation of local level needs and action (i.e. the interests of different stakeholders within the landscape), while also considering goals and outcomes important to stakeholders outside the landscape, such as national governments or the international community."&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

== Relevance to international commitments ==
Proponents of integrated landscape management argued that it is well-suited to address complex global challenges, such as those that are the focus of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] and policies for [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]] (REDD+).&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SDG briefing" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reed J, van Vianen J, Sunderland T. 2015. From 
global complexity to local reality: Aligning implementation pathways for the Sustainable Development Goals and landscape approaches
. Infobrief No. 129. Bogor, Indonesia: Center for International Forestry Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the '''Sustainable Development Goals''', researchers have drawn parallels between the interdependent nature of these Goals, and the perceived potential for integrated landscape management to maximise collaboration in planning, policy development and action across multiple sectors at the landscape scale.&lt;ref name="SDG briefing" /&gt; Many of the Sustainable Development Goals have potential synergies and trade-offs (conflicts): proponents therefore argue that a sectoral approach may not be effective, whereas landscape approaches provide a potential framework to manage these interlinked challenges. To give more specific examples, increased areas of irrigated agricultural land to meet Goal 2 (ending hunger) could have adverse impacts on Goal 15 (terrestrial ecosystems) or on Goal 6 (sustainable water management).&lt;ref&gt;Reed J, van Vianen J, Sunderland T. 2015. From global complexity to local reality: Aligning implementation pathways for the Sustainable Development Goals and landscape approaches. Infobrief No. 129. Bogor, Indonesia: Center for International Forestry Research.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscape approaches are intended to systematically consider and include diverse stakeholders and sectors, and thus create a mechanism to achieve the multiple objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals – for example, working across the catchment area of a river to enhance agricultural productivity, flood defence, biodiversity and carbon storage, while also strengthened institutions for rural communities.&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

In terms of '''climate change and REDD+''', unlike other sectors that emit greenhouse gases, the land use sector (including agriculture and forestry) has the potential to mitigate climate change by actively removing greenhouse gases, in addition to simply reducing emissions, especially through reforestation and landscape restoration. This sector accounts for around 24% of anthropogenic emisisons - and a much greater proportion of emissions in many developing countries, where land use represents the largest potential for climate change mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;Smith P., M. Bustamante, H. Ahammad, H. Clark, H. Dong, E. A. Elsiddig, H. Haberl, R. Harper, J. House, M. Jafari, O. Masera, C.  Mbow,  N.  H.  Ravindranath,  C. W.  Rice,  C.  Robledo  Abad,  A.

== Principles and elements ==
Many ways of implementing integrated landscape management have been identified. Two long-term processes by two coalitions of researchers and NGOs developed ten principles for integrated landscape management,&lt;ref name="Ten P" /&gt; and five elements of integrated landscape management.&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

The '''Ten Principles of Landscape Approach''' include the need for continual learning and [[adaptive management]], which incorporates participatory monitoring; the expectation that actions take place at multiple scales and that landscapes are multifunctional (e.g. supplying both goods, such as timber and food, and services, such as water and biodiversity protection); and although there will be multiple stakeholders, they nonetheless have a common concern about the landscape, negotiate change with each other in a transparent way, and their rights and responsibilities are clear or become clear through the process.&lt;ref name="Ten P"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sayer|first1=J|last2=Sunderland|first2=T|last3=Ghazoul|first3=J et al|title=Ten principles for a landscape approach to reconciling agriculture, conservation, and other competing land uses|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA|date=2013|volume=110|issue=21|pages=8349–8356|doi=10.1073/pnas.1210595110|url=http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ASunderland1302.pdf|pmc=3666687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Five Elements of Integrated Landscape Management''' describe the implementation cycle of a landscape approach, namely that: "interested stakeholders in the landscape come together for cooperative dialogue and action in a multi-stakeholder platform (1); they undertake a systematic process to exchange information and discuss perspectives to achieve a shared understanding of the landscape conditions, challenges and opportunities (2); this enables collaborative planning to develop an agreed action plan (3); stakeholders then implement the plan, with attention to maintaining collaborative commitments (4); and finally, monitoring for adaptive management and accountability feeds into subsequent rounds of dialogue and the design of new collaborative action (5)".&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; These five elements can be presented graphically in a circle, similar to the project management cycle.

== Risks and barriers ==
Despite many examples of implementation, and the interest of many public and private sector organisations (see for example participation at global fora on landscapes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Landscape Forum - the Investment Case speakers|url=http://www.landscapes.org/london-2016/speakers/|website=Global Landscape Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Global Landscapes Forum Final Report|url=http://www.landscapes.org/publication/2014-global-landscapes-forum-final-report/|website=Global Landscapes Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;), there are various barriers and risks around landscape approaches. An extensive literature review&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; identified five main barriers.

The first is '''terminology confusion''': the variety of definitions creates the potential for not only confusion, but also resistance to engage with an approach that has emerged, often somewhat independently, from different fields.&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; As stated by Scherr et al.: “People are talking about the same thing without realizing it. This can lead to fragmentation of knowledge, unnecessary re-invention of ideas and practices, and inability to mobilize action at scale. For policymakers, this rich diversity is often simply overwhelming: they receive confusing messages as to what an enabling policy environment to address the full set of landscape values would look like.”&lt;ref name="Scherr" /&gt;

These risks are far from unique to landscape approaches: since the 1970s it has been recognised that the constant emergence of new terms and labels from efforts to improve and integrate policy and practice for rural areas of developing countries can be harmful if they obscure problems or promote rhetoric at the expense of action.&lt;ref name="ODI"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Overseas Development Institute|title=Integrated Rural Development|journal=ODI Briefing Paper|date=1979|issue=04|url=https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6626.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that landscapes approaches develop from, and aim to integrate, a wide variety of concepts and sectors, makes it vulnerable to overlapping definitions and parallel conceptual development. Like other approaches to conservation, it could be seen as a fad.&lt;ref name="fads"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redford|first1=K|last2=Padoch|first2=C|last3=Sunderland|first3=T|title=Fads, funding and forgetting in three decades of conservation|journal=Conservation Biology|date=2013|volume=27|issue=3|pages=437–438|doi=10.1111/cobi.12071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further barriers to implementation have been identified. As has been the case with other integrated approaches, '''time lags''' result from the fact that substantial time and resources are invested both in developing concepts and planning projects, while resources are less adequate for implementation, and more limited still for monitoring the outcomes.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sayer" /&gt; Difficulties in establishing objectives, operating norms and funding that effectively bridge different sectors can lead to '''operating silos'''(where each sector pursues its goals without giving consideration to the others), whether at the level of local actors and institutions within a landscape, national ministries, or donors.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; Working across sectors at the landscape scale requires a range of skills, different from those traditionally used by conservation organisations.&lt;ref name="Sayer" /&gt;  Landscape approaches rely on the engagement of multiple stakeholders, which can lead to problems of '''Internal/external engagement''',&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt; if engagement is reduced to a box-ticking exercise or inaccessible to community participants,&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; or powerful players such as government agencies or large companies can be deterred by a perception that there is too much participatory discussion at the expense of efficient decision-making&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; The least developed area of landscape approaches is '''monitoring''', to understand whether the ambitious, multiple objectives of the approach have been achieved.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;

== Examples ==
Examples of landscape approaches are collated and analysed globally&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Minang" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landscapes for People Food and nature case studies http://peoplefoodandnature.org/analysis/all-publications/case-studies/&lt;/ref&gt; or regionally, for example from Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milder|first1=J C|last2=Hart|first2=A K|last3=Dobie|first3=P|last4=Minai|first4=J|last5=Zaleski|first5=C|title=Integrated landscape initiatives for Afircan agriculture, development, and conservation: a region-wide assessment|journal=World Development|date=2014|volume=54|pages=68–80|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Estrada-Carmona|first1=N|last2=Hart|first2=A K|last3=Declerk|first3=F A J|last4=Harvey|first4=C A|last5=Milder|first5=J C|title=Integrated landscape management for agriculture, rural livelihoods, and ecosystem conservation: an assessment of experience from Latin America and the Caribbean|journal=Landscape and urban planning|date=2014|volume=129|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; International organisations have developed programmes that apply the approach to multiple locations worldwide (for example, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] Livelihoods and Landscapes Strategies programme worked in 27 landscapes in 23 different countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Livelihoods and Landscapes|url=https://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/forest/fp_our_work/fp_projects/fp_our_work_ll/fp_livelihoods_landscapes_about/|publisher=IUCN}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some specific examples of implementation in individual landscapes are as follows.

An example of an indigenous producer movement that is managing a multi-functional landscape is from the [[Potato Park]] in Pisac, Peru, which is an Indigenous Biocultural Heritage Territory, where indigenous communities protect the ecological and cultural diversity of the 12000ha landscape.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt;

An example of cooperation between very different actors is from the landscape of the [[Doi Mae Salong]] watershed in North-west Thailand, a designated Military Reserved Area under the control of the Royal Thai Armed Forces. Reforestation activities, to address degradation caused by unsustainable land uses, led to tension with local hill tribes. In response, a multi-stakeholder dialogue was used to reach agreement on land rights and use of different parts of the reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=R J|last2=Kugel|first2=C|last3=Rattanasorn|first3=T|title=Unusual partnerships : lessons for landscapes and livelihoods from the Doe Mae Salong landscape, Thailand.|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10215|website=IUCN|publisher=IUCN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|2014 June 1, Mae Fa Luang District.jpg|1000px|Landscape near the Doi Mae Salong mountain in 2014}}

The [[Mount Kailash]] region is of particular religious and ecological importance, as it is here that the [[Indus River]], the [[Karnali River]] (a major tributary of the [[Ganges River]]), the [[Brahmaputra River]] and the [[Sutlej]] river systems originate. With assistance from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), the three surrounding countries (China, India and Nepal) developed an integrated management approach to the different conservation and development issues within this landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallrapp|first1=C|title=Transboundary landscape management in the Kailash Sacred Landscape|url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/blog/transboundary-landscape-management-in-the-kailash-sacred-landscape/|publisher=Landscapes for People Food and Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Volta River]] basin, [[landscape modelling]] illustrates the cause and effect of alternative scenarios for the riparian buffer, and is used to inform land-use decisions. Six countries in West Africa are using the ‘Mapping Ecosystems Services to Human well-being’ (MESH) toolkit to assess strategies for conserving hydrological [[ecosystem services]] and meeting national SDG commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wood|first1=S|last2=Jones|first2=S|title=Balancing multiple SDG-related outcomes of riparian buffers in the Volta Basin|url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/blog/balancing-multiple-sdg-related-outcomes-of-riparian-buffers-in-the-volta-basin/|publisher=Landscapes for People Food and Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International conservation NGOs are applying the approach using '''REDD+ financing''', for example [[Conservation International]] is using carbon financing from Disney in the 182,000-hectare [[Alto Mayo Protection Forest]], in the San Martín region of Peru. Smallholders sign up to REDD+ agreements, which provide incentives for them to reduce the rate of local deforestation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementing Forest Conservation in Peru’s Alto Mayo Region|url=http://www.conservation.org/stories/alto-mayo-protected-forest/Pages/overview.aspx/|publisher=Conservation International}}&lt;/ref&gt; independent verification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alto Mayo Conservation Initiative 2nd Verification Report|url=http://database.v-c-s.org/sites/v-c-s.org/files/042%20Alto%20Mayo%20VCS+CCB%202nd%20Verification%20Report-v1_Final%2015Jan2015.pdf|publisher=Verified Carbon Standard, The Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported improvements in living conditions, reduced deforestation, and positive impacts on biodiversity.

The '''Irish Music Hall of Fame''' was a multimedia exhibition in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] which opened in September 1999.  It recognised what it described as the best of Irish musical talent of all types over the decades. 

==Overview==
Musician and singer [[Van Morrison]] was the first person to be inducted into the museum. The museum was a memorabilia-filled display telling the story of Irish music through exclusive and personally donated merchandise from many important Irish musical artists including [[Van Morrison]], [[U2]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Rory Gallagher]], [[The Undertones]] and [[Boyzone]].

The museum has since closed and is currently looking for a new location with an undetermined reopening date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u2tour.de/travelguide/guides/en/Hot_Press_Irish_Music_Hall_Of_Fame_closed.html Infos at U2.tour.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">'''Joseph Leon Blau''' (May 6, 1909 &amp;ndash; December 28, 1986) was an American scholar of [[Jewish]] history and philosophy.

==Biography==
Blau was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. He attended [[Columbia University]], where he studied under [[Salo Wittmayer Baron]].  He earned his bachelor's degree in 1931, his master's in 1933, and his Ph.D. in 1944, all from Columbia.  Blau taught at Columbia from 1944-1977 and was chair of its Department of Religion from 1968-1977.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Blau was one of the signers of [[A Secular Humanist Declaration]] in 1980.  He was also one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=October 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archivedate=October 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a foreign member of the [[British Academy]].

He died in 1986 in [[Riverdale, New York]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Joseph L.

He was 77 years old. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=January 1, 1987 |accessdate=2009-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
His notable writings include ''Christian Interpretation of the Cabala in the Renaissance'' (1944); ''Men and Movements in American Philosophy'' (1952); ''The Story of Jewish Philosophy'' (1962), ''The Jews of the United States, 1790–1840'' (co-edited with Salo Baron, 1963), and ''Judaism in America'' (1976).

[[File:Air Force special tactics road march.jpg|thumb|US Air Force loaded march in 2009]]
A '''loaded march''' is a relatively fast march over distance carrying a load. It is both a common military exercise and a civilian activity.

A loaded march is known as a '''forced foot march''' in the [[US Army]]. Less formally, it is a '''ruck march''' in the Canadian Armed Forces and the US Army, a '''tab''' in [[British Army]] slang, a '''yomp''' in [[Royal Marines]] [[slang]], and '''stomping''' in [[Australian Army]] slang.

As a civilian exercise, loaded marching comes under the category of '[[hiking]]', although this includes activities not vigorous enough to be compared to loaded marching. Civilian activities analogous to loaded marches are quite popular in [[New Zealand]], where they are organised by [[Tramping in New Zealand|"tramping clubs"]].

In many countries, the ability to complete loaded marches is a core military skill, especially for infantry and special forces.  Loaded marching is particularly important in Britain, where all soldiers must complete annual loaded march tests.

In certain climates, the use of loaded marches is limited, since they would result in high casualty rates through [[heat exhaustion]].

==In the Roman Army==
According to [[Vegetius]], during the four-month initial training of a [[Roman legionary]], loaded marches were taught before recruits ever handled a weapon; since any formation would be split up by stragglers at the back or soldiers trundling along at differing speeds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roman-empire.net/army/training.html&lt;/ref&gt; Standards varied over time, but normally recruits were first required to complete 20 Roman miles (29.62&amp;nbsp;km or 18.405 modern miles) with 20.5&amp;nbsp;kg in five summer hours,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.therthdimension.org/AncientRome/Roman_Army/Training/training.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which was known as "the regular step" or "military pace". (The Romans divided daylight time into twelve equal hours. Depending on the exact day of the year and the latitude, the length of a "summer hour" would vary. Five summer hours is therefore not exact, but could indicate a time of approximately six modern hours.) They then progressed to the "faster step" or "full pace"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.therthdimension.org/AncientRome/Roman_Army/Training/training.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and were required to complete 24 Roman miles (35.544&amp;nbsp;km or 22.086 modern miles) in five summer hours loaded with {{convert|20.5|kg|0|sp=us}}. Training also included some forced marches of 20–30 miles, often followed by the construction of basic defences for an overnight position.

In some cases, each member of a Roman unit marched with a [[sudis (stake)|sudis]], to aid the construction of defences.

==In the British Armed Forces==
In the [[British Army]], loaded marching is considered a core skill and is tested annually in a {{convert|12.9|km|0|sp=us}} [[Annual Fitness Test]] (formerly known as a [[Combat Fitness Test]]) carrying 15–25&amp;nbsp;kg depending on the arm (25&amp;nbsp;kg for infantry, 20&amp;nbsp;kg for artillery, armour/cavalry, and engineers/sappers; 15&amp;nbsp;kg for other arms and services). However, infantry soldiers are additionally expected to complete advanced tests, typically a first day of 20&amp;nbsp;km (12.43 miles) with {{convert|30|kg|0|sp=us}} in three and a half hours, followed by a similar march with {{convert|20|kg|0|sp=us}} the next day. Within each arm, more demanding units exist (such as close support, commandos and parachutists) and have their own internal standards and tests. Special forces also use their own tests.

During the current selection process, Army recruits are usually made to tab {{convert|3|km|0|sp=us}}  as an introduction. This is because injuries to the legs are common during basic training tabbing.

The British Army slang term ''tab'' has its roots in an [[acronym]], being an abbreviation of Tactical Advance to Battle.

Loaded marches have been particularly important in the [[British Army]] since the 1982 [[Falklands War]]. Many British commanders felt that British success in the war was linked to the British soldiers' ability to march across the difficult Falklands terrain with their kit. British infantry soldiers in Afghanistan conducted four-hour patrols carrying an average of {{convert|50|kg|0|sp=us}} of equipment, going into battle with that weight if they encountered enemy fighters. There is some debate as to whether this makes them better equipped for battle or weighs them down too much.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/8455741/Britains-donkey-soldiers-are-losing-the-war-in-Afghanistan.html Britain's 'donkey' soldiers are losing the war in Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the French Foreign Legion==
To complete training, [[French Foreign Legion|legionnaire]] trainees must complete the ''parcours du combattant'' ("Combatant's Course") of {{convert|8|km|0|sp=us}} loaded with rifle, helmet and {{convert|12|kg|0|sp=us}}  in 40 minutes, and a night march of {{convert|25|km|0|sp=us}} in three hours with a load of {{convert|18|kg|0|sp=us}}. Various marches of much longer distances are also a part of training such as the "Kepi" march of 50&amp;nbsp;km in full combat gear carrying a rifle, helmet and 30&amp;nbsp;kg load and the "Raid march" of 120&amp;nbsp;km in full combat gear carrying a rifle, helmet and 30&amp;nbsp;kg load simulating the navigation to and raiding of different checkpoints in 3 days. Troublemakers are made to place extra rocks in their backpacks for the duration of the marches. Further in the training of a "Caporal" there is a 100&amp;nbsp;km march which must be completed in 24 hours.

==In the United States Armed Forces==
Loaded marches in the [[United States Army]] are known as ruck marches and are part of basic recruit training. In order to gain the [[Expert Infantryman Badge]] (a further qualification for existing infantry personnel) candidates must complete a ruck march of {{convert|19|km|0|sp=us}}  within three hours, carrying a rifle and load. The total load (including the rifle) may be up to {{convert|31.75|kg|0|sp=us}}.  The march is individual rather than in a squad, so an individual may achieve a better time than the three-hour requirement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5954">'''MARXAN''' is software designed to aid systematic reserve design on conservation planning. With the use of stochastic optimisation routines ([[Simulated Annealing]]) it generates spatial reserve systems that achieve particular biodiversity representation goals with reasonable optimality.

Computationally, MARXAN provides solutions to a conservation version of the 0-1 [[knapsack problem]], where the objects of interest are potential reserve sites with given biological attributes. The simulated annealing algorithm attempts to minimise the total cost of the reserve system, while achieving a set of conservation goals (typically that a certain percentage of each geographical/biological feature is represented by the reserve system).

== History ==
MARXAN is a portmanteau acronym, fusing '''MAR'''ine, and SPE'''XAN''', itself an acronym for '''SP'''atially '''EX'''plicit '''AN'''nealing. It was a product of Ian R. Ball's PhD thesis, while he was a student at the [[University of Adelaide]] in 2000, and was supervised and funded by [[Hugh Possingham]], who currently holds a [[Federation Fellowship]] at the [[University of Queensland]]. It was an extension of the existing SPEXAN program.

== Application ==
MARXAN is the most widely used systematic reserve planning software in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Airamé et al. (2003) ''Applying ecological criteria to marine reserve design: a case study from the California Channel Islands'', Ecological Applications, 13(1), S170-S184.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used to create the marine reserve network on the [[Great Barrier Reef]], in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], the largest marine protected area in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Environment News Service - International Daily Newswire (2004). Fish Boats Barred From One-Third of Great Barrier Reef [online]. Available: http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2004/2004-07-01-06.asp [Access date:  28 May 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used for many other marine reserve planning applications, including:&lt;ref&gt;For more details of these applications, see the [http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/index.html?page=29781 Ecology Centre MARXAN Homepage].&lt;/ref&gt;

MARXAN has been used extensively by [[The Nature Conservancy]], and is a major part of the systematic planning tools being used in the Global Marine Initiative. The [[World Wildlife Fund]] used MARXAN to define a Global set of Marine Protected Areas, the ''Roadmap to Recovery'', which they used to petition the UN about the creation of open ocean marine reserve networks.

The software has also been used in terrestrial applications, such as:
* The North American [[Wildlands Project]].
* Selecting priority areas for Global Mammal Assemblages.&lt;ref&gt;Ceballos, G. ''et al.'' (2006) ''Global Mammal Conservation: What Must We Manage?'', Science, 309(5734), 603-607.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Planning the conservation of [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref&gt;Chan, K.M.A. ''et al.'' (2006) ''Conservation planning for ecosystem services?'', Public Library of Science: Biology, 4(11), e379.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shortcomings ==
One shortcoming of MARXAN  is its inability to deal with issues of demographic inter-connectedness. In marine systems, the presence of a biological feature does not guarantee the persistence of that feature in the absence of the surrounding ecosystem. This is a concept generally known as "connectivity". MARXAN considers that including into a reserve system a site that contains a particular feature will ensure the persistence of that feature, even though surrounding sites may not be included in the reserve system, and may therefore be ecologically compromised. MARXAN does employ a "boundary length modifier", which attempts to minimise the boundary length to area ratio, thus increasing the continuity of the reserve systems. This ''ad hoc'' alteration may go some way to addressing the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, H. ''et al.'' (2003) ''Using siting algorithms in the design of marine reserve networks'', Ecological Applications, 13(1), S185-S198.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mechanical, electrical and plumbing''' ('''MEP''') refers to these aspects of building design and construction.  In commercial buildings these aspects are often designed by an engineering firm specializing in MEP. MEP design is important for design decision-making, accurate documentation, performance and cost-estimation, construction planning, managing and operating the resulting facility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MEP makes engineering projects faster and reduces cost|url=https://www.ny-engineers.com/blog/how-mep-integration-makes-engineering-projects-faster-and-less-expensive|website=ny-engineers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Design and documentation ==
As with other aspect of buildings, MEP [[Technical drawing|drafting]], design and documentation were traditionally done manually.  [[Computer-aided design]] had some advantages over this, in some instances including [[3D modeling]].  [[Building information modeling]] provides holistic design and parametric change management of the MEP design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setty.com/pdf_presentations/RC_Whitepaper_Revit_Systems_BIM_for_MEP_Engine.pdf|title=Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing|website=Setty.com|publisher=Revit MEP:BIM for MEP Engineering|date=12 February 2013|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814101043/http://www.setty.com/pdf_presentations/RC_Whitepaper_Revit_Systems_BIM_for_MEP_Engine.pdf|archivedate=14 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mononuclear cell infiltrates are characteristic of [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] lesions, where white blood cells, mainly [[macrophages]] and [[lymphocytes]], collect at the site of injury to help clear away the debris. It is the sign of onset of [[graft rejection]].

The '''Netherlands Aerospace Centre''' (NLR) (former Nationaal Lucht- en Ruimtevaartlaboratorium)  is the National Aerospace Laboratory of the [[Netherlands]] and is one of its major technological institutes. These institutes perform a large part of the applied research in the Netherlands, each within its own specific field of technology. As an independent [[non-profit organisation]], the NLR is the aerospace-knowledge enterprise in the Netherlands and provides high-quality technical support to the aerospace sector (NLR is [[ISO 9000|ISO 9001:2000]]/AQAP-110 certified).

==Organisation==

NLR's activities are market-oriented, independent, socially relevant and without profit priority. By acting so, NLR can adequately respond to the need for scientific knowledge and technology in the field of aviation and space travel, which arises from the government, public and industry. Thus being the natural partner for aerospace research.
Work under research contracts (national and international, government and industry) amounts to 75 percent of NLR's activities, the remaining 25 percent is funded by the Dutch government for basic demand-oriented research programmes and development of research equipment. Depending on the project and the customer's preferences, NLR acts as a sole contractor or as a subcontractor co-operating with other institutes or partners from industry.
Research and development work is carried out on a project basis with great synergy between divisions and departments. Strong emphasis is laid on a customer oriented approach.

==History==

The RSL, the predecessor of NLR, was officially founded on 5 April 1919, shortly after the [[First World War]]. Although air power did not play a decisive role during this war, [[aeronautics]] had nevertheless progressed very rapidly during that period.
Aeronautics developed slowly in the Netherlands during the first two decades of this century when compared to the neighbouring countries, as for example France.
After the [[Armistice]], 11 November 1918, the aeronautical community started to concentrate on the application of the newly obtained skills and experience. The Government appointed a committee to review the possibilities of aerial applications. The year 1919 saw many new initiatives.
On Saturday 5 April 1919 (when Saturday was a normal working day), the new Laboratory of the RSL was officially opened in the presence of representatives of the Government in a building at the Navy Yard in [[Amsterdam]]. However, at this official opening there was already a laboratory in operation. The laboratory RSL was given an excellent start, although the human and material resources were limited.

In his opening speech Prof. L.A. van Royen emphasized that the RSL should develop free and open communications with the aeronautical world and in turn the RSL should be assisted to come into contact with those who are interested in the activities of RSL. The interested parts should also be able to influence the activities of RSL.
The RSL was originated at offices belonging to the Ministry of Defence mainly as a result of the aviation activities of the Army (since 1913) and the Navy (since 1917). The groundwork for the foundation of RSL started during World War I in 1917, when civil aviation in the Netherlands was non-existent. On 1 January 1920 the RSL was transfer from the Ministry of Defence to the Ministry of Public Works because after the war the defence spending was cut drastically and [[civil aviation]] appeared in the horizon.
As early as 1922, the Minister of Public Works proposed to terminate RSL. The main argument was that the annual funding was considered extravagant. Fortunately nothing happened immediately and the dispute continued for many years.
When in 1918 the RSL was planned, the location at the Navy Yard in Amsterdam was meant as a temporary site only. Prof. van Royen intended to establish a permanent laboratory in Delft, in close association with Delft University of Technology ([[TU Delft]]). However, the university apparently was not too eager to accommodate the RSL, probably because of the problems encountered in the 1920s after the RSL became part of the Ministry of Public Works. Also, flight testing had become an important part of the activities and several people felt that a location close to [[Schiphol]] and [[Fokker]] was more important than being close to TU Delft.
The RSL essentially developed along the lines as planned during 1918-1919, till it was converted in the independent Foundation NLL in 1937. The only major change in its formal task took place when a separate Department of Civil Aviation (RLD) was created to supervise [[airworthiness]] and aircraft operations in the Netherlands. However this did not have much effect on the technical content of the work of the RSL; it was a separation of responsibilities. This shift of responsibilities was related to the desire of the aircraft industry in the 1930s to have a national laboratory to which all interested parts would have access on an equal basis, according to Ir. A.J. Marx.

The centre piece of the laboratory was an Eiffel type [[wind tunnel]]. The construction of the wind tunnel was complicated because with only limited information available, Dr. Ir. E.B. Wolff managed to produce an operational tunnel by March 1919 and it was shown at the official opening of the RSL.

The tunnel – essentially a pipe with two open ends – had the air drawn from the room in which the tunnel was placed and it was exhausted into that same room at the other end. It must be assumed that he decided on an Eiffel type tunnel because of the size and limitations of the building and on the results published by Eiffel. Through this arrangement he achieved at least a facility of reasonable size and [[Reynolds Number]]. The tunnel had an open test section and, with a maximum power of 30 [[Horsepower]], the mean velocity at the 1.6 meter diameter test section was 25&amp;nbsp;m/s. However, the uniformity of the flow across the test section was quite unsatisfactory and large fluctuations in time occurred.
After investigations of the flow in the wind tunnel, several modifications were introduced. The result was that by July 1920 a fairly uniform and steady air flow of about 35&amp;nbsp;m/s in the test section was obtained. This tunnel was used extensively for a period of 20 years for a variety of aeronautical and non-aeronautical tests and, apart from smaller research facilities which were built at TU Delft, it was the only wind tunnel available for aeronautical development in the Netherlands till 1940.
In the meantime Wolff and Koning carried out studies for new wind tunnel facilities. As a result, two closed type wind tunnels were built in the new laboratory at Sloterweg in Amsterdam that became fully operational in 1940. One was the LST 3 x 2 m² which was large enough to simulate powered aircraft flight and a smaller, the LST 1.5 x 1.5 m² tunnel for research purposes and non-aeronautical wind tunnel testing. They were the main low speed aerodynamics facilities for over 40 years till the DNW (the joint venture with the German sister organisation [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]]) became operational in 1980, followed by the LST 3 x 2.25 m² of NLR, both in the [[Noordoostpolder]].

During the five years of the [[Second World War]] the total contract work-load of the laboratory decreased dramatically although the personnel increased by 40%.&lt;ref name="Reports4445"&gt;NLR Annual Reports of 1944 and 1945&lt;/ref&gt; However, it appears that a large number of subjects were studied in depth.&lt;ref name="Reports4445"/&gt; When the Allied Forces entered the Netherlands in September 1944 the situation changed very dramatically. The food and fuel supply, already at a bare minimum, practically stopped. Everybody at the laboratory was mentally occupied with the problems of war, survival, food and fuel. 
It took several months after the Liberation Day on 5 May 1945 for the normal operations of the laboratory to become re-established. Although the laboratory did not incur physical damage during the war, it was not in good condition after the war. Above that, until 1952 there was a political climate unfavourable to NLL especially in terms of financial support for the expansion plans of the NLL that included a HST, among other facilities.

The year 1950 marked the beginning of international co-operation and cross utilisation of facilities between NLL and [[ONERA]]. On 23 February 1955 a contract between AICMA-CIPS and NLL was signed which stipulated that NLL would make available the HST to members of AICMA for up to 50% of the available testing time. Later, in 1976, a two-nation aeronautical test facility, the DNW of Germany and the Netherlands, became a reality, and it took until 1988 when finally a four-nation (France, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands) aeronautical test facility, the ETW, was opened.
In 1957, after a period of deliberations and negotiations, an area of 2 square kilometres was purchased in the Noordoostpolder (NOP). In 1958 the first NLR employees started working there. Since then there has been a gradual shift of activities from Amsterdam the NOP and several buildings were added.

==Sites==

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Sites NLR.jpg|thumb|Figure 7: NLR locations {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

A staff of approximately 650 people is employed at two sites, one located in Amsterdam, and the other in Marknesse (about 100&amp;nbsp;km north-east of Amsterdam). Over two-thirds of the staff are graduates from universities or technical colleges, with a large variety in specialised professions such as [[aerospace engineer]]s, [[psychologists]], [[mathematicians]] and [[physicist]]s. Such variety is necessary for ensuring the broad expertise that is needed for coping with the most challenging problems in the aerospace sector.

At its two sites NLR owns several sophisticated aerospace research facilities, including different wind tunnels, such as the Low Speed Wind tunnel, the Transonic and the Supersonic Wind Tunnel. Exploitation of these wind tunnels and the wind tunnels of DLR have been entrusted to the foundation German-Dutch wind tunnels (DNW), which also includes a large facility in the Noordoostpolder in which Germany and the Netherlands have a share of 50%.

==Facilities==

NLR has a laboratory airplane, a [[Cessna Citation II]] (PH-LAB), latter shared with Delft University of Technology (TU Delft).

NLR has developed different [[flight simulators]] for research on aircraft and helicopters.

NLR conducts research on future concepts in Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) using its advanced proprietary simulation platform, the NLR ATC Research Simulator (NARSIM). NARSIM consists of two physical instantiations, one for en-route ATC (NARSIM-Radar) and one for airport tower controllers (NARSIM-Tower) with a 360-degrees field-of-view visual system. NARSIM is also used for performance of technology verification and validation activities as well as air traffic controller training.

NLR has installations in which airplane constructions on full scale, components and test samples can be tested. Equipment and software for development of construction of parts for airplanes and space vehicles are also available. For development and construction of composites a special laboratory has been arranged. Moreover, the NLR has instrumentation for flight tests, and several specialized apparatus for development of avionics. Facilities for testing antenna and conduction of so-called environmental tests are used to test several equipments. In the micromechanics workplace the NLR develops models and instruments for wind tunnel tests. The computer network of the NLR contains a supercomputer for the implementation of extensive aerodynamic and structural calculations.

The '''Michigan Population Studies Center''' is a '''[[demography]]''' center in the United States, with an extensive record in both domestic and international population research and training.

== History &amp; Research Focus ==

The [[University of Michigan]]'s Population Studies Center (PSC) was established in 1961, originally as a unit within the Department of Sociology. The Center has had close connections to the Department of Economics since 1966. The Center has become increasingly interdisciplinary over time, drawing faculty from [[Anthropology]], [[Economics]], [[Geography]], [[Natural Resources]], [[Political Science]], [[Psychology]], [[Public Health]], Public Policy, [[Social Work]], [[Sociology]], and [[Statistics]]. The energy and intellectual curiosity of the Center's researchers, fostered by the strong support environment and leavened by their interaction with visitors and students at all levels, is a major source of Center momentum.

The PSC comprises independent population researchers who pursue their own agendas with the support of the PSC staff. A large portfolio of both domestic and international research is supported by the Center. The Center focuses on several [http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/research/ key areas of demographic research], which can be grouped into several major areas: 
1) Families, Fertility &amp; Children; 2) Health, Disability &amp; Mortality; 3) Human Capital, Labor &amp; Wealth; 4) [[Aging]]; 5) [[Population dynamics]]; 6) Inequality &amp; Group Disparities; 7) Methodology.

== Organization and Administration ==

The Center made a major institutional move in July 1998, from the College of Literature, Science, and Arts into the Institute for Social Research (ISR). The merger into ISR facilitates close integration between the PSC's demographic research and the long tradition in survey methodology and major data collection projects at ISR. PSC becomes the fourth center in ISR, joining the Survey Research Center, the Center for Political Studies, and the Research Center for Group Dynamics.

The Center provides administrative and support services to researchers through three core units: Administrative Services, Computing Services, and Information Services., The Administrative Core provides management and administrative support for Research Associates and their funded research projects. The Computing Core provides a state-of-the-art social science computing environment to support the Center's research and training missions. The Information Services Core provides resources and services in three broad areas. Data Services maintains a collection of demographic data files that are routinely used by Center researchers and assists in the acquisition, organization, and management of data for PSC research projects. Library Services maintains a collection of local holdings and assists researchers in collecting information from University libraries and in doing demographic library research using traditional and electronic resources. The Communications Office provides editorial services and disseminates research results through the production of working papers and web sites.

[[Image:ArlandThorntonMentoring2003.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Mentoring a Demography trainee]]

== Graduate and Postdoctoral Training ==

The Population Studies Center provides apprenticeship training and fellowship support to graduate students in Sociology, Economics, Public Health, and Anthropology who choose demography as a field of specialization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/training/ Training program in demography]&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the graduate training program is to produce social scientists, fully trained in their discipline, with broad knowledge in population studies and specialized skills in statistical and demographic techniques, who can undertake independent research on a wide range of population topics. In the apprenticeship program student trainees gain practical research experience under the supervision of a professional staff member. The Center does not award graduate degrees. All graduate students associated with the Center are admitted into department Ph.D. programs and earn their degrees in those programs. The Center also provides postdoctoral training to demographic researchers in a variety of fields.

== PSC Financial Support ==

The PSC was established with funding from the Ford Foundation, and received continued support from the Ford Foundation for over 20 years. Since 1976 the Center has been supported by a population center grant (R24 HD041028) from the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD), part of the National Institutes of Health. This center grant provides core infrastructure support for the Center's research activities. NICHD center grant support continues to be the major source of funding for the Center's cores. The Center also collaborates with the Survey Research Center of ISR in operating the [http://micda.psc.isr.umich.edu/ Michigan Center on the Demography of Aging (MiCDA)], funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), also part of the National Institutes of Health. Additional support for PSC's international research and training activities is provided by grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10429">In the theory of [[quantum communication]], the '''quantum capacity''' is the highest rate at which [[quantum information]] can be communicated over many independent uses of a noisy [[quantum channel]] from a sender to a receiver. It is also equal to the highest rate at which [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]] can be generated over the channel, and forward classical communication cannot improve it. The quantum capacity theorem is important for the theory of [[quantum error correction]], and more broadly for the theory of [[quantum computation]]. The theorem giving a lower bound on the quantum capacity of any channel is colloquially known as the LSD theorem, after the authors [[Seth Lloyd|Lloyd]],&lt;ref name="Lloyd1997"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Physical Review A | volume = 55 | issue = 3 | pages = 1613–1622 | year = 1997 | author = Seth Lloyd |title = Capacity of the noisy quantum channel | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.55.1613 | arxiv = quant-ph/9604015|bibcode = 1997PhRvA..55.1613L }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Shor|Shor]],&lt;ref name="Shor2002"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Lecture Notes, MSRI Workshop on Quantum Computation | year = 2002 | author = Peter Shor | title = The quantum channel capacity and coherent information | url = http://www.msri.org/publications/ln/msri/2002/quantumcrypto/shor/1/meta/aux/shor.pdf | format = pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Devetak&lt;ref name="Devetak2005"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = IEEE Transactions on Information Theory | volume = 51 | pages = 44–55 | year = 2005 | author = Igor Devetak | title = The private classical capacity and quantum capacity of a quantum channel | doi = 10.1109/TIT.2004.839515 | arxiv = quant-ph/0304127}}&lt;/ref&gt; who proved it with increasing standards of rigor.

== Hashing bound for Pauli channels ==

The LSD theorem states that the [[coherent information]] of a [[quantum channel]] is an achievable rate for reliable quantum communication. For a [[Pauli channel]], the [[coherent information]] has a simple form{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} and the proof that it is achievable is particularly simple as well. We{{Who|date=October 2017}} prove the theorem for this special case by exploiting random [[stabilizer code]]s and correcting only the likely errors that the channel produces.

'''Theorem''' (hashing bound). There exists a stabilizer [[quantum error-correcting code]] that achieves the hashing limit &lt;math&gt;R=1-H\left(\mathbf{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for a Pauli channel of the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \rho \mapsto p_{I}\rho+p_{X}X\rho X+p_{Y}Y\rho Y+p_{Z}Z\rho Z,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=\left(p_{I},p_{X},p_{Y},p_{Z}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H\left(\mathbf{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the entropy of this probability vector.

'''Proof'''. Consider correcting only the typical errors. That is, consider defining the
[[typical set]] of errors as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}\equiv\left\{  a^{n}:\left\vert -\frac{1}{n}
\log_{2}\left(  \Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}}\right\}  \right)  -H\left(
\mathbf{p}\right)  \right\vert \leq\delta\right\} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a^{n}&lt;/math&gt; is some sequence consisting of the letters &lt;math&gt;\left\{I,X,Y,Z\right\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pr\left\{E_{a^{n}}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability
that an IID Pauli channel issues some tensor-product error &lt;math&gt;E_{a^{n}}\equiv
E_{a_{1}}\otimes\cdots\otimes E_{a_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. This typical set consists of the likely errors in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum_{a^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}}\Pr\left\{E_{a^{n}}\right\} \geq 1-\epsilon,
&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The error-correcting
conditions&lt;ref name="NC"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = Michael A. | author1-link = Michael Nielsen | last2 = Chuang | first2 = Isaac L. | author2-link = Isaac Chuang | title = Quantum Computation and Quantum Information | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | date = 2000 | isbn = 9780521635035}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for a stabilizer code &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; in this case are that &lt;math&gt;\{E_{a^{n}}:a^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a correctable set of errors if
:&lt;math&gt;
  E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger}E_{b^{n}}\notin N\left(\mathcal{S}\right) \backslash \mathcal{S},
&lt;/math&gt;
for all error pairs &lt;math&gt;E_{a^{n}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{b^{n}}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a^{n},b^{n}\in
T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N(\mathcal{S})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[normalizer]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. Also, we consider the expectation of the error probability under a random choice of a stabilizer code.

Proceed as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{S}}\left\{p_{e}\right\}
  &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{S}}
     \left\{
       \sum_{a^{n}} \Pr \left\{ E_{a^{n}}\right\}
       \mathcal{I}\left(E_{a^{n}}\text{ is uncorrectable under }\mathcal{S}\right)
     \right\} \\
  &amp;\leq \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{S}}
     \left\{
       \sum_{a^{n} \in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}}
       \Pr\left\{E_{a^{n}}\right\}
       \mathcal{I}\left(E_{a^{n}}\text{ is uncorrectable under }\mathcal{S}\right)
     \right\} + \epsilon \\
  &amp;= \sum_{a^{n} \in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}}
     \Pr\left\{E_{a^{n}}\right\} \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{S}}
     \left\{
       \mathcal{I}\left(E_{a^{n}}\text{ is uncorrectable under }\mathcal{S}\right)
     \right\} + \epsilon \\
  &amp;= \sum_{a^{n} \in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}}
     \Pr\left\{E_{a^{n}}\right\}
     \Pr_{\mathcal{S}} \left\{E_{a^{n}}\text{ is uncorrectable under }\mathcal{S}\right\} + \epsilon.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The first equality follows by definition—&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; is an indicator function equal to one if &lt;math&gt;E_{a^{n}}&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrectable under &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and equal to zero otherwise. The first inequality follows, since we correct only the typical errors because the atypical error set has negligible probability mass. The second equality follows by exchanging the expectation and the sum. The third equality follows because the expectation of an indicator function is the probability that the event it selects occurs. Continuing, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  =\sum_{a^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}}\Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}}\right\}
\Pr_{\mathcal{S}}\left\{  \exists E_{b^{n}}:b^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}
^{n}},\ b^{n}\neq a^{n},\ E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger}E_{b^{n}}\in N\left(  \mathcal{S}
\right)  \backslash\mathcal{S}\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \leq\sum_{a^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{A^{n}}}\Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}}\right\}
\Pr_{\mathcal{S}}\left\{  \exists E_{b^{n}}:b^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}
^{n}},\ b^{n}\neq a^{n},\ E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger}E_{b^{n}}\in N\left(  \mathcal{S}
\right)  \right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  =\sum_{a^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}}\Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}}\right\}
\Pr_{\mathcal{S}}\left\{  \bigcup\limits_{b^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}
},\ b^{n}\neq a^{n}}E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger}E_{b^{n}}\in N\left(  \mathcal{S}\right)
\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \leq\sum_{a^{n},b^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}},\ b^{n}\neq a^{n}}
\Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}}\right\}  \Pr_{\mathcal{S}}\left\{  E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger
}E_{b^{n}}\in N\left(  \mathcal{S}\right)  \right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \leq\sum_{a^{n},b^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}},\ b^{n}\neq a^{n}}
\Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}}\right\}  2^{-\left(  n-k\right)  }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \leq2^{2n\left[  H\left(  \mathbf{p}\right)  +\delta\right]  }2^{-n\left[
H\left(  \mathbf{p}\right)  +\delta\right]  }2^{-\left(  n-k\right)  }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  =2^{-n\left[  1-H\left(  \mathbf{p}\right)  -k/n-3\delta\right]  }.
&lt;/math&gt;
The first equality follows from the error-correcting conditions for a quantum stabilizer code, where &lt;math&gt;N\left(  \mathcal{S}\right)  &lt;/math&gt; is the normalizer of
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. The first inequality follows by ignoring any potential degeneracy in the code—we consider an error uncorrectable if it lies in the normalizer &lt;math&gt;N\left(  \mathcal{S}\right)  &lt;/math&gt; and the probability can only be larger because &lt;math&gt;N\left(  \mathcal{S}\right)  \backslash\mathcal{S}\in N\left(
\mathcal{S}\right)  &lt;/math&gt;. The second equality follows by realizing that the probabilities for the existence criterion and the union of events are equivalent. The second inequality follows by applying the union bound. The third inequality follows from the fact that the probability for a fixed operator &lt;math&gt;E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger}E_{b^{n}}&lt;/math&gt; not equal to the identity commuting with
the stabilizer operators of a random stabilizer can be upper bounded as follows:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Pr_{\mathcal{S}}\left\{  E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger}E_{b^{n}}\in N\left(  \mathcal{S}
\right)  \right\}  =\frac{2^{n+k}-1}{2^{2n}-1}\leq2^{-\left(  n-k\right)  }.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The reasoning here is that the random choice of a stabilizer code is equivalent to
fixing operators &lt;math&gt;Z_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;Z_{n-k}&lt;/math&gt; and performing a uniformly random
Clifford unitary. The probability that a fixed operator commutes with
&lt;math&gt;\overline{Z}_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;\overline{Z}_{n-k}&lt;/math&gt; is then just the number of
non-identity operators in the normalizer (&lt;math&gt;2^{n+k}-1&lt;/math&gt;) divided by the total number of non-identity operators (&lt;math&gt;2^{2n}-1&lt;/math&gt;). After applying the above bound, we then exploit the following typicality bounds:
:&lt;math&gt;
\forall a^{n}   \in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}:\Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}
}\right\}  \leq2^{-n\left[  H\left(  \mathbf{p}\right)  +\delta\right]  },&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\vert T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}\right\vert   \leq2^{n\left[  H\left(
\mathbf{p}\right)  +\delta\right]  }.
&lt;/math&gt;
We conclude that as long as the rate &lt;math&gt;k/n=1-H\left(  \mathbf{p}\right)
-4\delta&lt;/math&gt;, the expectation of the error probability becomes arbitrarily small, so that there exists at least one choice of a stabilizer code with the same bound on the error probability.

Broadly speaking, a '''risk assessment''' is the combined effort of 1. identifying and analyzing potential (future) events that may negatively impact individuals, assets, and/or the environment (i.e., risk analysis); and 2. making judgments "on the tolerability of the risk on the basis of a risk analysis" while considering influencing factors (i.e., risk evaluation).&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EHeLmbUVh8C&amp;pg=PT21 |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction |title=Risk Assessment: Theory, Methods, and Applications |author=Rausand, M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=1–28 |year=2013 |isbn=9780470637647}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PopovRisk16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqjLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 |chapter=Chapter 1: Risk Assessments: Their Significance and the Role of the Safety Professional |title=Risk Assessment: A Practical Guide to Assessing Operational Risks |author=Manuele, F.A. |editor=Popov, G.; Lyon, B.K.; Hollcraft, B.  |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=1–22 |year=2016 |isbn=9781118911044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put in simpler terms, a risk assessment analyzes what can go wrong, how likely it is to happen, what the potential consequences are, and how tolerable the identified risk is.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt; As part of this process, the resulting determination of risk may be expressed in a [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] or [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] fashion. The risk assessment plays an inherent part of an overall [[risk management]] strategy, which attempts to, after a risk assessment, "introduce control measures to eliminate or reduce" any potential risk-related consequences.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PopovRisk16" /&gt;

== Need ==
===Individual risk assessment===
Risk assessment is necessary in individual cases, including patient and physician interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbu.se/contentassets/e7039ddba84c4eca9b474d6b15c9c9ac/vop_eng_18_180521_lr.pdf|title=Getting Real About Both Benefits and Risks|last=Levi|first=Ragnar|date=June 1, 2018|website=Swedish Agency of Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services|pages=8–9|language=en|via=[https://www.sbu.se/en/publications/medical-science-and-practice/new-issue-sbu-newsletter-medical-science-and-practice/ Science &amp; Practice, English Special 2018]|issn=1104-1250|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual judgements or assessments of risk may be affected by psychological, ideological, religious or otherwise subjective factors, which impact rationality of the process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A [[systematic review]] of patients and doctors from 2017 found that overstatement of benefits and understatement of risks occurred more often than the alternative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=Tammy C.|last2=Del Mar|first2=Chris|year=2015|title=Patients' expectations of the benefits and harms of treatments, screening, and tests: a systematic review|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=175|issue=2|pages=274–286|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.6016|issn=2168-6114|pmid=25531451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tendency for individuals to be less rational when risks and exposures concern themselves as opposed to others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also a tendency to underestimate risks that are voluntary or where the individual sees themselves as being in control, such as smoking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 2017 systematic review from the [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane collaboration]] suggests “well-documented decision aids” are helpful in reducing effects of such tendencies or biases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stacey|first=Dawn|last2=Légaré|first2=France|last3=Lewis|first3=Krystina|last4=Barry|first4=Michael J.|last5=Bennett|first5=Carol L.|last6=Eden|first6=Karen B.|last7=Holmes-Rovner|first7=Margaret|last8=Llewellyn-Thomas|first8=Hilary|last9=Lyddiatt|first9=Anne|date=12 April 2017|title=Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=4|pages=CD001431|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001431.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28402085}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ways statistics are expressed and communicated, both through words and numerically also impact the interpretation of benefit and harm. For example, a fatality rate may be interpreted as less benign than the corresponding survival rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Systems risk assessment===
Risk assessment can also be made on a much larger "systems" scale, for example assessing the risks of a nuclear power plant (an interactively complex mechanical, electronic, nuclear, and human system) or a hurricane (a complex meteorological and geographical system). Systems may be defined as linear and nonlinear (or complex), where linear systems are predictable and relatively easy to understand given a change in input, and non-linear systems unpredictable when inputs are changed.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13-6"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EHeLmbUVh8C&amp;pg=PT166 |chapter=Chapter 6: Accident Models |title=Risk Assessment: Theory, Methods, and Applications |author=Rausand, M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=137–76 |year=2013 |isbn=9780470637647}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, risk assessments of non-linear/complex systems tend to be more challenging.

In the engineering of complex systems, sophisticated risk assessments are often made within [[safety engineering]] and [[reliability engineering]] when it concerns threats to life, [[Natural environment|environment]], or machine functioning. The agriculture, nuclear, aerospace, oil, railroad, and military industries have a long history of dealing with risk assessment.&lt;ref name="VamanuCritical16"&gt;{{cite book |title=Critical Infrastructures: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment in Transportation of Dangerous Goods: Transportation by Road and Rail |author=Vamanu, B.I.; Gheorghe, A.V.; Kaina, P.F. |publisher=Springer |page=11 |year=2016 |isbn=9783319309316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, medical, hospital, [[social services|social service]],&lt;ref name="LaceyAnApp11"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lacey |first=Peter |title=An Application of Fault Tree Analysis to the Identification and Management of Risks in Government Funded Human Service Delivery |journal=Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Public Policy and Social Sciences |year=2011 |ssrn=2171117}}&lt;/ref&gt; and food industries control risks and perform risk assessments on a continual basis. Methods for assessment of risk may differ between industries and whether it pertains to general financial decisions or environmental, ecological, or public health risk assessment.&lt;ref name="VamanuCritical16" /&gt;

== Concept ==
Rapid technological change, increasing scale of industrial complexes, increased system integration, market competition, and other factors have been shown to increase societal risk in the past few decades.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt; As such, risk assessments become increasingly critical in mitigating accidents, improving safety, and improving outcomes. Risk assessment consists of an objective evaluation of [[risk]] in which assumptions and uncertainties are clearly considered and presented. This involves identification of risk (what can happen and why), the potential consequences, the [[Outcome (probability)|probability of occurrence]], the tolerability or acceptability of the risk, and ways to mitigate or reduce probability of the risk.&lt;ref name="PopovRisk16" /&gt; Optimally, it also involves documentation of the risk assessment and its findings, implementation of mitigation methods, and review of the assessment (or risk management plan), coupled with updates when necessary.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt; Sometimes risks can be deemed acceptable, meaning the risk "is understood and tolerated ... usually because the cost or difficulty of implementing an effective countermeasure for the associated vulnerability exceeds the expectation of loss."&lt;ref name="ShireyInternet07"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4949 |title=Internet Security Glossary, Version 2 |author=Shirey, R. |work=Network Working Group |publisher=The IETF Trust |page=9 |date=August 2007 |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the difficulty in managing risk is that both the quantities by which risk assessment is concerned—potential loss and probability of occurrence—can be very difficult to measure. The chance of error in measuring these two concepts is high. Risk with a large potential loss and a low probability of occurrence is often treated differently from one with a low potential loss and a high likelihood of occurrence. In theory, both are of near equal priority, but in practice it can be very difficult to manage when faced with the scarcity of resources—especially time—in which to conduct the risk management process.

===Mathematical conceptualization===
[[Image:RiskAssessment.jpg|thumb|320px|Risk assessment from a financial point of view.]]
To see the risk management process expressed mathematically, one can define total risk as the sum over individual risks, &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, which can be computed as the product of potential losses, &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt;, and their probabilities, &lt;math&gt;p(L_i)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;R_i=L_i p(L_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{total}=\sum_i L_i p(L_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Even though for some risks &lt;math&gt;R_i, R_j&lt;/math&gt;, we might have &lt;math&gt;R_i = R_j&lt;/math&gt;, if the probability &lt;math&gt;p(L_j)&lt;/math&gt; is small compared to &lt;math&gt;p(L_i)&lt;/math&gt;, its estimation might be based only on a smaller number of prior events, and hence, more uncertain. On the other hand, since &lt;math&gt;R_i = R_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt; must be larger than &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt;, so decisions based on this uncertainty would be more consequential, and hence, warrant a different approach.

Financial decisions, such as insurance, express loss in terms of dollar amounts.  When risk assessment is used for public health or environmental decisions, loss can be quantified in a common metric such as a country's currency or some numerical measure of a location's quality of life.  For public health and environmental decisions, loss is simply a verbal description of the outcome, such as increased cancer incidence or incidence of birth defects. In that case, the "risk" is expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;R_i= p(L_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
If the risk estimate takes into account information on the number of individuals exposed, it is termed a "population risk" and is in units of expected increased cases per a time period. If the risk estimate does not take into account the number of individuals exposed, it is termed an "individual risk" and is in units of incidence rate per a time period.  Population risks are of more use for cost/benefit analysis; individual risks are of more use for evaluating whether risks to individuals are "acceptable".

====Quantitative risk assessment====
{{Further|Quantitative Risk Assessment software}}
In quantitative risk assessment an [[annualized loss expectancy]] (ALE) may be used to justify the cost of implementing countermeasures to protect an asset. This may be calculated by multiplying the [[single loss expectancy]] (SLE), which is the loss of value based on a single security incident, with the [[annualized rate of occurrence]] (ARO), which is an estimate of how often a threat would be successful in exploiting a vulnerability.

The usefulness of quantitative risk assessment has been questioned, however. [[Barry Commoner]], [[Brian Wynne]] and other critics have expressed concerns that risk assessment tends to be overly quantitative and reductive. For example, they argue that risk assessments ignore qualitative differences among risks. Some charge that assessments may drop out important non-quantifiable or inaccessible information, such as variations among the classes of people exposed to hazards, or social amplification.&lt;ref name="Kasperson"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kasperson, R.E., Renn, O., Slovic, P., Brown, H.S., Emel, J., Goble, R., Kasperson, J.X., Ratick, S.| year=1988 | title = The social amplification of risk: A conceptual framework|journal= Risk Analysis|volume=8|issue=2|pages=177–187|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1988.tb01168.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Commoner and O'Brien claim that quantitative approaches divert attention from precautionary or preventative measures.&lt;ref&gt;Commoner, Barry. O'Brien, Mary. Shrader-Frechette and Westra 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] consider risk managers little more than "blind users" of statistical tools and methods.&lt;ref&gt;The fourth quadrant: a map of the limits of statistics [9.15.08] Nassim Nicholas Taleb An Edge Original Essay&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment of risk ==
The process of risk assessment may be somewhat informal at the individual social level, managing economic and household risks,&lt;ref name="HolzmannSocial01"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Social Risk Management: A New Conceptual Framework for Social Protection, and Beyond |journal=International Tax and Public Finance |author=Holzmann, R.; Jørgensen, S. |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=529–56 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1011247814590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NakašThree17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://knowledgehub.cef-see.org/?p=1399 |title=Three Lessons About Risk Management from Everyday Life |author=Nakaš, N. |work=Knowledge Hub |publisher=Center of Excellence in Finance |date=21 November 2017 |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a sophisticate process at the strategic corporal level. However, in both cases, ability to anticipate future events and create effective strategies for mitigating them when deemed unacceptable is vital.

At the individual level, a simple process of identifying objectives and risks, weighing their importance and creating plans, may be all that's necessary. At the strategic organisational level, more elaborate policies are necessary, specifying acceptable levels of risk, procedures to be followed within the organisation, priorities, and allocation of resources.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017" /&gt;{{rp|10}} At the systematic level, management involved with the project produce project level risk assessments with the assistance of the available expertise as part of the planning process, and set up systems to ensure that required actions to manage the assessed risk are in place. At the dynamic level, the personnel directly involved may be required to deal with unforeseen problems in real time. The tactical decisions made at this level should be reviewed after the operation to provide feedback on the effectiveness of both the planned procedures and decisions made in response to the contingency.

The first step in risk assessment is to establish the context. This restricts the range of hazards to be considered.

This is followed by ''identification of visible and implied hazards'' that may threaten the project, and ''determining the qualitative nature of the potential adverse consequences'' of each hazard. Without a potential adverse consequence, there is no hazard.

It is also necessary to identify the potential parties or assets which may be affected by the threat, and the potential consequences to them if the hazard is activated.

If the consequences are dependent on dose, i.e. the amount of exposure, the relationship between dose and severity of consequence must be established, and the risk depends on the probable dose, which may depend on concentration or amplitude and duration or frequency of exposure. This is the general case for many health hazards where the mechanism of injury is toxicity or repetitive injury, particularly where the effect is cumulative.

For other hazards, the consequences may either occur or not, and the severity may be extremely variable even when the triggering conditions are the same. This is typical of many biological hazards as well as a large range of safety hazards. Exposure to a pathogen may or may not result in actual infection, and the consequences of infection may also be variable. Similarly a fall from the same place may result in minor injury or death, depending on unpredictable details. In these cases estimates must be made of reasonably likely consequences and associated probability of occurrence.

In cases where statistical records are available they may be used to evaluate risk, but in many cases there are no data or insufficient data available to be useful. Mathematical or experimental models may provide useful input.

=== Dose dependent risk ===
[[Image:Risk Based Sampling Nomogram (3yr).png|right|200px|thumb|Food risk assessment [[nomogram]]]]

#''Dose-Response Analysis'', is determining the relationship between dose and the type of adverse response and/or probability or the incidence of effect (dose-response assessment). The complexity of this step in many contexts derives mainly from the need to extrapolate results from experimental animals (e.g. [[mouse]], [[rat]]) to humans, and/or from high to lower doses, including from high acute occupational levels to low chronic environmental levels. In addition, the differences between individuals due to [[genetics]] or other factors mean that the hazard may be higher for particular groups, called susceptible populations. An alternative to dose-response estimation is to determine a concentration unlikely to yield observable effects, that is, a [[no effect concentration]]. In developing such a dose, to account for the largely unknown effects of animal to human extrapolations, increased variability in humans, or missing data, a prudent approach is often adopted by including safety or uncertainty factors in the estimate of the "safe" dose, typically a factor of 10 for each unknown step.
#''Exposure Quantification'', aims to determine the amount of a contaminant (dose) that individuals and populations will receive, either as a contact level (e.g., concentration in ambient air) or as intake (e.g., daily dose ingested from drinking water). This is done by examining the results of the discipline of [[exposure assessment]]. As different location, lifestyles and other factors likely influence the amount of contaminant that is received, a range or distribution of possible values is generated in this step. Particular care is taken to determine the exposure of the susceptible population(s).

The results of these steps are combined to produce an estimate of risk. Because of the different susceptibilities and exposures, this risk will vary within a population. An uncertainty analysis is usually included in a health risk assessment.

== Dynamic risk assessment ==
During an emergency response, the situation and hazards are often inherently less predictable than for planned activities (non-linear). In general, if the situation and hazards are predictable (linear), standard operating procedures should deal with them adequately. In some emergencies this may also hold true, with the prepared and trained responses being adequate to manage the situation. In these situations, the operator can manage risk without outside assistance, or with the assistance of a backup team who are prepared and available to step in at short notice.

Other emergencies occur where there is no previously planned protocol, or when an outsider group is brought in to handle the situation, and they are not specifically prepared for the scenario that exists but must deal with it without undue delay. Examples include police, fire department, disaster response and other public service rescue teams. In these cases ongoing risk assessment by the involved personnel can advise appropriate action to reduce risk.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017" /&gt; HM Fire Services Inspectorate has defined dynamic risk assessment (DRA) as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The continuous assessment of risk in the rapidly changing circumstances of an operational incident, in order to implement the control measures necessary to ensure an acceptable level of safety.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lock|first1=Gareth|editor1-last=Phillips|editor1-first=Mark|title=Public Safety Diving-Dynamic Risk Assessment|journal=PS Diver Magazine|date=June 2017|issue=116|page=9|url=http://psdiver.com/images/PSDiver_Issue_116_-_SECURE.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2017|publisher=PSDiver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dynamic risk assessment is the final stage of an integrated safety management system which can provide appropriate response during changing circumstances. It relies on experience, training and continuing education, including effective debriefing to analyse not only what went wrong, but also what went right, and why, and to share this with other members of the team and the personnel responsible for the planning level risk assessment.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017" /&gt;

==Fields of application==
Application of risk assessment procedures is common in a wide range of fields, and these may have specific legal obligations, codes of practice and standardised procedures. Some of these are listed here.

=== General health ===
There are many resources that provide health risk information.

The [[National Library of Medicine]] provides risk assessment and regulation information tools for a varied audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Risk Assessment and Regulation Information from the NLM|url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro/riskinformation.html|publisher=[[National Library of Medicine|NLM]]|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
* TOXNET (databases on hazardous chemicals, environmental health, and toxic releases),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Databases on toxicology, hazardous chemicals, environmental health, and toxic releases|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov|work=TOXNET|publisher=[[National Library of Medicine|NLM]]|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Household Products Database (potential health effects of chemicals in over 10,000 common household products),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Household Products Database|url=http://hpd.nlm.nih.gov/|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[TOXMAP]] (maps of the [[Superfund|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund]] and [[Toxics Release Inventory]] data).
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] provides basic information about environmental health risk assessments for the public for a wide variety of possible environmental exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Risk Assessment Portal|url=http://www.epa.gov/risk/|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Protection Agency began actively using risk assessment methods to protect drinking water in the United States after passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974. The law required the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on drinking water issues, and in its report the NAS described some methodologies for doing risk assessments for chemicals that were suspected carcinogens, recommendations that top EPA officials have described as perhaps the study’s most important part.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: Senior EPA officials discuss early implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=13 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/6014106B36AE81EB.pdf#page=11 Transcript] (see pages 11,14).&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the increase in junk food and its toxicity, FDA required in 1973 that cancer-causing compounds must not be present in meat at concentrations that would cause a cancer risk greater than 1 in a million over a lifetime. The US Environmental Protection Agency provides extensive information about ecological and environmental risk assessments for the public via its risk assessment portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/risk/|title=Risk Assessment|last=EPA, ORD, NCEA|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stockholm Convention]] on [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) supports a qualitative risk framework for public health protection from chemicals that display environmental and biological persistence, [[bioaccumulation]], toxicity (PBT) and long range transport; most global chemicals that meet this criteria have been previously assessed quantitatively by national and international health agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szabo DT, Loccisano AE |title= POPs and Human Health Risk Assessment|journal=Dioxins and Persistent Organic Pollutants |volume=3rd |issue=Edition |pages=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=March 30, 2012| doi= 10.1002/9781118184141.ch19 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118184141.ch19/summary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Small sub-populations ====
When risks apply mainly to small sub-populations, there is uncertainty at which point intervention is necessary. For example, there may be a risk that is very low for everyone, other than 0.1% of the population. It is necessary to determine whether this 0.1% is represented by:
* all infants younger than ''X'' days or
* recreational users of a particular product.

If the risk is higher for a particular sub-population because of abnormal exposure rather than susceptibility, strategies to further reduce the exposure of that subgroup are considered.  If an identifiable sub-population is more susceptible due to inherent genetic or other factors, public policy choices must be made. The choices are:
* to set policies for protecting the general population that are protective of such groups, e.g. for children when data exists, the Clean Air Act for populations such as asthmatics or
* not to set policies, because the group is too small, or the costs too high.

==== Acceptable risk criteria ====
The idea of not increasing lifetime risk by more than one in a million has become commonplace in public health discourse and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/iwachap10.pdf|title=Acceptable Risk|first1=Paul R.|last1=Hunter|first2=Lorna|last2=Fewtrell|publisher=''[[World Health Organization]]''|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a heuristic measure. It provides a numerical basis for establishing a negligible increase in risk.

Environmental decision making allows some discretion for deeming individual risks potentially "acceptable" if less than one in ten thousand chance of increased lifetime risk.  Low risk criteria such as these provide some protection for a case where individuals may be exposed to multiple chemicals e.g. pollutants, food additives or other chemicals.

In practice, a true zero-risk is possible only with the suppression of the risk-causing activity.

Stringent requirements of 1 in a million may not be technologically feasible or may be so prohibitively expensive as to render the risk-causing activity unsustainable, resulting in the optimal degree of intervention being a balance between risks vs. benefit. For example, emissions from hospital incinerators result in a certain number of deaths per year. However, this risk must be balanced against the alternatives.  There are public health risks, as well as economic costs, associated with all options. The risk associated with no [[incineration]] is potential spread of infectious diseases, or even no hospitals. Further investigation identifies options such as separating noninfectious from infectious wastes, or air pollution controls on a medical incinerator.

Intelligent thought about a reasonably full set of options is essential.  Thus, it is not unusual for there to be an iterative process between analysis, consideration of options, and follow up analysis.

===Auditing===
For audits performed by an outside audit firm, risk assessment is a crucial stage before accepting an audit engagement. According to ISA315 ''Understanding the Entity and its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement'', "the auditor should perform risk assessment procedures to obtain an understanding of the entity and its environment, including its internal control". Evidence relating to the auditor’s risk assessment of a material misstatement in the client’s financial statements. Then, the auditor obtains initial evidence regarding the classes of transactions at the client and the operating effectiveness of the client’s internal controls. Audit risk is defined as the risk that the auditor will issue a clean unmodified opinion regarding the financial statements, when in fact the financial statements are materially misstated, and therefore do not qualify for a clean unmodified opinion. As a formula, audit risk is the product of two other risks: Risk of Material Misstatement and Detection risk. This formula can be further broken down as follows:  [[inherent risk]] × [[control risk]] × [[detection risk]].

=== Public health ===
In the context of [[public health]], risk assessment is the process of characterizing the nature and likelihood of a harmful effect to individuals or populations from certain human activities. Health risk assessment can be mostly qualitative or can include statistical estimates of probabilities for specific populations. In most countries the use of specific chemicals or the operations of specific facilities (e.g. power plants, manufacturing plants) is not allowed unless it can be shown that they do not increase the risk of death or illness above a specific threshold. For example, the American [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates food safety through risk assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, Richard A. "Food Safety Regulation: Reforming the Delaney Clause" in ''Annual Review of Public Health'', 1997, 18:313-40. This source includes a useful historical survey of prior food safety regulation.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project management===
In [[project management]], risk assessment is an integral part of the risk management plan, studying the probability, the impact, and the effect of every known risk on the project, as well as the corrective action to take should an incident implied by a risk occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/managing-project-risks Managing Project Risks] - Retrieved May 20th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Of special consideration in this area are the relevant codes of practice that are enforced in the specific jurisdiction. Understanding the regime of regulations that risk management must abide by is integral to formulating safe and compliant risk assessment practices.

=== Information security ===
{{Main|IT risk management#Risk assessment}}

[[IT risk|Information technology risk]] assessment can be performed by a qualitative or quantitative approach, following different methodologies. One important difference{{clarify|reason=difference from what?|date=June 2017}} in risk assessments in information security is modifying the threat model to account for the fact that any adversarial system connected to the Internet has access to threaten any other connected system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Global adversarial capability modeling|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7120797|journal = 2015 APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime)|date = 2015-05-01|pages = 1–21|doi = 10.1109/ECRIME.2015.7120797|first = J.|last = Spring|first2 = S.|last2 = Kern|first3 = A.|last3 = Summers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk assessments may therefore need to be modified to account for the threats from all adversaries, instead of just those with reasonable access as is done in other fields.

Another notable difference is the strategic nature of IT risk assessments.  Unlike tactical vulnerability assessments and penetration testing which aim to identify and close specific gaps in security, IT risk assessments are functional at the executive level to examine the broader picture of IT risk management.{{clarify|reason=what does this actually mean|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arnold|first1=Rob|title=3 Types of Security Assessments|url=https://threatsketch.com/3-types-cyber-security-assessments/|website=Threat Sketch|publisher=Threat Sketch|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Megaprojects ===
[[Megaprojects]] (sometimes also called "major programs") are extremely large-scale investment projects, typically costing more than US$1 billion per project. They include bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, coastal flood protection, oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and defence systems. Megaprojects have been shown to be particularly risky in terms of finance, safety, and social and environmental impacts.

=== Software evolution ===
Studies have shown that early parts of the system development cycle such as requirements and design specifications are especially prone to error. This effect is particularly notorious in projects involving multiple [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] with different points of view. Evolutionary software processes offer an iterative approach to [[Requirements engineering|requirement engineering]] to alleviate the problems of uncertainty, ambiguity and inconsistency inherent in software developments.{{clarify|reason=What does this have to do with risk assessment?|date=June 2017}}

=== Shipping industry ===
In July 2010, shipping companies agreed to use standardized procedures in order to assess risk in key shipboard operation. These procedures were implemented as part of the amended [[International Safety Management Code|ISM Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISM CODE – Amendments from 1st July 2010 Risk Assessment |url=http://www1.veristar.com/veristar/dps_info.nsf/veristar/Dps_info.nsf/AllByDateInternal/353FC02A22D59873C1257734003EC51C?opendocument}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underwater diving ===
{{see also|List of diving hazards and precautions}}
Formal risk assessment is a required component of most [[Professional diving|professional dive planning]], but the format and methodology may vary. Consequences of an incident due to an identified hazard are generally chosen from a small number of standardised categories, and probability is estimated based on statistical data on the rare occasions when it is available, and on a best guess estimate based on personal experience and company policy in most cases. A simple matrix is often used to transform these inputs into a level of risk, generally expressed as unacceptable, marginal or acceptable. If unacceptable, measures must be taken to reduce the risk to an acceptable level, and the final outcome of the risk assessment must be accepted by the affected parties before a dive commences. Higher levels of risk may be acceptable in special circumstances, such as military or search and rescue operations when there is a chance of recovering a survivor. [[Diving supervisor]]s are trained in the procedures of [[hazard identification and risk assessment]], and it is part of their planning and operational responsibility. Both health and safety hazards must be considered. Several stages may be identified. There is risk assessment done as part of the diving project planning, on site risk assessment which takes into account the specific conditions of the day, and [[dynamic risk assessment]] which is ongoing during the operation by the members of the dive team, particularly the supervisor and the working diver.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009"&gt;{{cite web |title=Diving Regulations 2009 |work=Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993 – Regulations and Notices – Government Notice R41 |url=http://www.saflii.org/za/legis/consol_reg/ohasa85o1993rangnr41716/ |publisher=Government Printer |location=Pretoria |via=Southern African Legal Information Institute |accessdate=3 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104080007/http://www.saflii.org/za/legis/consol_reg/ohasa85o1993rangnr41716/ |archivedate=4 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMCA D022 2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Staff|first=|title=Guidance for diving supervisors IMCA D 022|edition=Revision 1|date=August 2016|publisher=International Marine Contractors Association|location=London, UK|pages=15{{hyphen}}5|chapter=15 - General safety requirements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[recreational scuba diving]], the extent of risk assessment expected of the diver is relatively basic, and is included in the [[Buddy check|pre-dive checks]]. Several mnemonics have been developed by [[diver certification agencies]] to remind the diver to pay some attention to risk, but the training is rudimentary. Diving service providers are expected to provide a higher level of care for their customers, and [[diving instructor]]s and [[divemaster]]s are expected to assess risk on behalf of their customers and warn them of site-specific hazards and the competence considered appropriate for the planned dive. Technical divers are expected to make a more thorough assessment of risk, but as they will be making an informed choice for a recreational activity, the level of acceptable risk may be considerably higher than that permitted for occupational divers under the direction of an employer.&lt;ref name="Diving at Work Regulations 1997" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/2776/made |title=The Diving at Work Regulations 1997 |last=Staff |year=1977 |work=Statutory Instruments 1997 No. 2776 Health and Safety |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) |location=Kew, Richmond, Surrey |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurr 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurr|first=Kevin |editor-last=Mount |editor-first=Tom|editor2-last=Dituri |editor2-first=Joseph|title=Exploration and Mixed Gas Diving Encyclopedia|edition=1st|date=August 2008|publisher=International Association of Nitrox Divers|location=Miami Shores, Florida|isbn=978-0-915539-10-9|pages=165–180|chapter=13: Operational Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoor and wilderness adventure===
In outdoor activities including commercial outdoor education, wilderness expeditioning and [[Outdoor_recreation | outdoor recreation]], risk assessment refers to analysis of the probability and magnitude of unfavorable outcomes such as injury, illness, or property damage due to environmental and related causes, compared to the human development or other benefits of outdoor activity. This is of particular importance as school programs and others weigh the benefits of youth and adult participation in various outdoor learning activities against the inherent and other hazards present in those activities.  Schools, corporate entities seeking team-building experiences, parents/guardians, and others considering outdoor experiences expect or require&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nwais.org/uploaded/accreditation_resources/2018_Membership_AccredRubric.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; organizations to assess the hazards and risks of different outdoor activities—such as sailing, mountaineering, or camping—and select activities with acceptable risk profiles.

Outdoor education, wilderness adventure, and other outdoor-related organizations should, and are in some jurisdictions required, to conduct risk assessments prior to offering programs for commercial purposes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.supportadventure.co.nz/adventure-activities-regulations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2016/0019/latest/DLM6725703.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/aala/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Such organizations are given guidance on how to provide their risk assessments&lt;ref&gt;https://worksafe.govt.nz/topic-and-industry/adventure-activities&lt;/ref&gt; and external consultancy services provide these assessments as well&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outdoorsafetyinstitute.com/pages/reviews/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.viristar.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nols.edu/en/about/risk-services/&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Environment ===
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) aims at assessing the effects of stressors, often chemicals, on the local environment. A risk is an integrated assessment of likelihood and severity of an undesired event. In ERA, the undesired event often depends on the chemical of interest and on the risk assessment scenario.&lt;ref name="Goussen et al 2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goussen|first=Benoit|last2=Price|first2=Oliver R.|last3=Rendal|first3=Cecilie|last4=Ashauer|first4=Roman|date=2016-10-26|title=Integrated presentation of ecological risk from multiple stressors|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep36004|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/srep36004|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5080554|pmid=27782171}}&lt;/ref&gt; This undesired event is usually a detrimental effect on organisms, populations or ecosystems. Current ERAs usually compare an exposure to a no-effect level, such as the [[Predicted environmental concentration|Predicted Environmental Concentration]]/[[Predicted no-effect concentration|Predicted No-Effect Concentration]] (PEC/PNEC) ratio in Europe. Although this type of ratio is useful and often used in regulation purposes, it is only an indication of an exceeded apparent threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jager|first=Tjalling|last2=Heugens|first2=Evelyn H.

=== Biodiversity ===
Biodiversity Risk Assessments evaluate risks to [[biological diversity]], specially the risk of [[species]] [[extinction]] or the risk of [[ecosystem collapse]]. The units of assessments are the biological (species, [[subspecies]] or [[population]]s) or ecological entities ([[habitat]]s, [[ecosystem]]s, etc), and the risk are often related to human actions and interventions (threats and pressures). Regional and national protocols have been proposed by multiple academic or governmental institutions and working groups,&lt;ref name="NicholsonRegan2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=Emily|last2=Regan|first2=Tracey J.|last3=Auld|first3=Tony D.|last4=Burns|first4=Emma L.|last5=Chisholm|first5=Laurie A.|last6=English|first6=Valerie|last7=Harris|first7=Stephen|last8=Harrison|first8=Peter|last9=Kingsford|first9=Richard T.|last10=Leishman|first10=Michelle R.|last11=Metcalfe|first11=Daniel J.|last12=Pisanu|first12=Phil|last13=Watson|first13=Christopher J.|last14=White|first14=Matthew|last15=White|first15=Matt D.|last16=Williams|first16=Richard J.|last17=Wilson|first17=Bruce|last18=Keith|first18=David A.|title=Towards consistency, rigour and compatibility of risk assessments for ecosystems and ecological communities|journal=Austral Ecology|volume=40|issue=4|year=2015|pages=347–363|issn=14429985|doi=10.1111/aec.12148}}&lt;/ref&gt; but global standards such as the [[Red List of Threatened Species]] and the [[IUCN Red List of Ecosystems]] have been widely adopted, and are recognized or proposed as official indicators of progress toward international policy targets and goals, such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|Aichi targets]] and the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="KeithRodríguez2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=David A.|last2=Rodríguez|first2=Jon Paul|last3=Brooks|first3=Thomas M.|last4=Burgman|first4=Mark A.|last5=Barrow|first5=Edmund G.|last6=Bland|first6=Lucie|last7=Comer|first7=Patrick J.|last8=Franklin|first8=Janet|last9=Link|first9=Jason|last10=McCarthy|first10=Michael A.|last11=Miller|first11=Rebecca M.|last12=Murray|first12=Nicholas J.|last13=Nel|first13=Jeanne|last14=Nicholson|first14=Emily|last15=Oliveira-Miranda|first15=María A.|last16=Regan|first16=Tracey J.|last17=Rodríguez-Clark|first17=Kathryn M.|last18=Rouget|first18=Mathieu|last19=Spalding|first19=Mark D.|title=The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems: Motivations, Challenges, and Applications|journal=Conservation Letters|volume=8|issue=3|year=2015|pages=214–226|issn=1755263X|doi=10.1111/conl.12167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrooksButchart2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=Thomas M.|last2=Butchart|first2=Stuart H.M.|last3=Cox|first3=Neil A.|last4=Heath|first4=Melanie|last5=Hilton-Taylor|first5=Craig|last6=Hoffmann|first6=Michael|last7=Kingston|first7=Naomi|last8=Rodríguez|first8=Jon Paul|last9=Stuart|first9=Simon N.|last10=Smart|first10=Jane|title=Harnessing biodiversity and conservation knowledge products to track the Aichi Targets and Sustainable Development Goals|journal=Biodiversity|volume=16|issue=2-3|year=2015|pages=157–174|issn=1488-8386|doi=10.1080/14888386.2015.1075903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}

The '''Saltire Prize''', named after the [[flag of Scotland]], is the national award for advances in the commercial development of [[marine energy]].

To be considered for the £10 million award teams must demonstrate, in [[Scottish waters]], a commercially viable [[Wave energy|wave]] or [[tidal stream energy]] technology "that achieves the greatest volume of electrical output over the set minimum hurdle of 100GWh over a continuous 2 year period using only the power of the sea."

The Saltire Prize is open to any individual, team or organisation from across the world who believes they have wave or tidal energy technology capable of fulfilling the challenge. Applications can be submitted between March 2010 and January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltireprize.com/challenge |title=The Challenge | publisher=saltireprize.com |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already there are five competitors registered.

==Additional prizes==

• The '''Saltire Prize Lecture''' - delivered at the Scottish Renewables Marine Conference every September, it focuses on the challenges in converting our world lead in wave and tidal energy to an industry of commercial scale, and in securing the economic, environmental and social benefits that this industry can bring.  The lecture is designed to promote knowledge exchange between academics, industry, financiers and government.

• The '''Saltire Prize Medal''' - created to recognise outstanding contributions to the development of marine renewable energy. The Medal is awarded every March at the Scottish Renewables Annual Conference, Exhibition and Dinner.

• The '''Junior Saltire Prize''' - launched in 2011, this is aimed at primary and secondary school pupils and was designed to help raise awareness of the opportunities that Scotland has to exploit its marine renewables potential.  It is sponsored by Skills Development Scotland and awards are presented to teams in three age groups: p5-7, s1-3 and s4-6.

• A '''Saltire Prize-sponsored doctorate''' in collaboration with the Energy Technology Partnership (ETP) - This was announced in August 2012.  The research will consider how marine energy projects can be designed to maximise economic energy production while protecting the environment.

• '''Power of the Sea''' - a one off junior photography competition sponsored by the Saltire Prize, aimed at raising awareness of the natural environment and its potential for marine energy.	In December 2012, four young photographers from Scottish primary schools were selected by renowned Scottish photographer, David Eustace, as the national winners.

==History==
When it was first announced in 2008 it was the world's largest ever single prize for innovation in marine renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/04/02151533 |title=World to compete for Saltire Prize| publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize is overseen by the Challenge Committee. Saltire Prize policy is the responsibility of the Offshore Renewables Policy Team in the Scottish Government's Energy and Climate Change Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltireprize.com/about-us |title=About us| publisher=saltireprize.com |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitors==

'''Sense about Science''' is a UK charity that promotes the [[Public awareness of science|public understanding of science]]. Sense about Science was founded in 2002 by [[Lord Taverne]], [[Bridget Ogilvie]] and others to promote respect for [[scientific evidence]] and [[Scientific method|good science]]. Sense about Science was established as a [[charitable trust]] in 2003, with 14 trustees, an advisory council and a small office staff. Tracey Brown has been the director since 2002.&lt;ref name="Team" /&gt;

Sense about Science aims to work with scientists, journalists and others to ensure that scientific evidence is at the forefront of public discussions about science, and to correct unscientific [[misinformation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/workshops.html Sense About Science 'Voice of Young Science' workshop], "Ellen Raphael talked about Sense about Science, discussing projects and the ways we correct misinformation with examples from the last five years."&lt;/ref&gt; They encourage and assist scientists to engage in public debates about their area of [[expert]]ise, to respond to scientifically inaccurate claims in the media, to help people contact scientists with appropriate expertise, and to prepare briefings about the scientific background to issues of public concern.

It is a campaign that helps people request for themselves the evidence behind news stories, marketing claims and policies.&lt;ref name="Ask for Evidence"/&gt; When challenged in this way, organisations may withdraw their claims or send evidence to support them.  The campaign is supported by more than 6000 volunteer scientists who are available to review the evidence provided and determine whether it supports the original claim or story.&lt;ref name="ESP20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Episode #020, feat. Chris Peters|url=https://soundcloud.com/user-721155342/theesp-ep-020-chris-peters#t=00:00|website=The [[European Skeptics Podcast]]|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign has received funding from The [[Wellcome Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Empowering people to 'Ask for Evidence'|url = http://blog.wellcome.ac.uk/2015/10/13/empowering-people-to-ask-for-evidence/|website = Wellcome Trust Blog|accessdate = 2015-11-17|first = Kate Arkless|last = Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is endorsed by figures such as [[Dara Ó Briain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Ask for Evidence {{!}} Dara Ó Briain, performer|url = http://askforevidence.org/articles/dara-o-briain-performer|website = Ask for Evidence|accessdate = 2015-11-17|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Derren Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Ask for Evidence {{!}} Derren Brown, illusionist|url = http://askforevidence.org/articles/derren-brown-illusionist|website = Ask for Evidence|accessdate = 2015-11-17|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Peters, Scientific Affairs Manager at Sense About Science, has said, 'If you ask people for evidence then they expect to be asked for evidence in the future'.&lt;ref name="ESP20"/&gt;  This can lead to a cultural shift in the organisation; they make sure they have the evidence from the start and are more evidence-based.

=== Keep Libel Laws Out of Science ===
Sense About Science  launched the Keep Libel Laws out of Science campaign in June 2009&lt;ref name="SAScience"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/keep-libel-laws-out-of-science.html Sign up now to keep the libel laws out of science!] ''Sense About Science''&lt;/ref&gt; in defence of a member of its board of trustees,&lt;ref name="SAS_Board"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/board-of-trustees.html Board of Trustees,] ''Sense About Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; author and journalist [[Simon Singh]], who has been sued for [[libel]] by the [[British Chiropractic Association]].

In April 2010, the BCA lost this case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE63018820100401 | work=Reuters | title=Science writer wins "fair comment" libel appeal | first=Michael | last=Holden | date=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the court accepting that criticism of the BCA concerning its promotion of bogus treatments was [[fair comment]].

In December 2009, Sense About Science, [[Index on Censorship]] and [[English PEN]] launched the Libel Reform Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Launch of the Libel Reform Campaign ·  Sense about Science|url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/launch-of-the-libel-reform-campaign.html|website = www.senseaboutscience.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Defamation Act 2013]] received Royal Assent on 25 April 2013 and came into force on 1 January 2014.

The Trust actively campaigns in support of various causes. It has issued a statement signed by over 35 scientists&lt;ref name="Letter to WHO"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/docs/VOYSlettertoWHO.doc Letter to WHO, signed by at least 35 scientists], ''Sense About Science''&lt;/ref&gt; asking the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] to condemn [[homeopathy]] for diseases such as HIV.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;Sample, Ian (1 June 2009).[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jun/01/world-health-organisation-homeopathy-hiv "British scientists ask WHO to condemn homeopathy for diseases such as HIV"].

&lt;!--(No good references available for this piece)-Sense About Science organised a  climate change conference,&lt;ref name=climate/&gt; which resulted in stories warning against the exaggeration and 'Hollywoodisation' of climate change, and the publication of a report "Making Sense of Climate Change". The authors of this report said they firmly believe global warming is happening and man-made emissions of greenhouse gases are a significant cause. But warned that exaggeration of the problems confused the public and made it easier to argue that the scientists were wrong.

== Funding ==

Sense about Science's principal funding is through grants and donations in respect of its core aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Charity overview|url = http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1146170&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its funding policy it states: "Donations do not entitle any individual or organisation to decision-making authority. External funding will not divert Sense About Science from its agreed aims and values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Our funding policy ·  Sense about Science|url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/our-funding-policy.html|website = www.senseaboutscience.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the trust has been increasing. Some is derived from industrial organizations engaged in scientific dispute, clinical trials and research for which SAS is supportive (e.g. genetically modified crops) as well as major publishing houses. For example, for the fiscal year ending 5 April 2008, the trust received £145,902 in donations. Disclosed corporate donations comprised £88,000 with pharmaceutical company [[Astra Zeneca]] donating £35,000.&lt;ref name="2008-2010_FiscalStatements"&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1101114&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 "Sense About Science Financial Statements"], Charity Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; Previous donations included other [[pharmaceutical lobby|pharmaceutical]] industries such as [[Pfizer]].&lt;ref name="2008-2010_FiscalStatements" /&gt; This dependency has now been diminished since for the fiscal year ending April 2010, the trust received £183,971 in donations of which £17,500 was derived from the pharmaceutical industry (Unilever and G E Healthcare). In 2011 the amount diminished further to less than 6% funding derived from industry sources (the trust received £268,184 in donations with £15,000 from industry)  with the rest derived from Science Bodies and individuals.&lt;ref name="2008-2010_FiscalStatements" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2010-2011 fiscal statement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Statements 2011|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1101114&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|publisher=Charity Commission|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sense about Science discloses the names of its funders and the purpose of each donation received in its annual reports. Its largest donor during 2015-16 was the [[Laura and John Arnold Foundation]], which donated between £40,001-50,000 to support the [[AllTrials]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Sense about Science, Annual Review 2015/16, http://senseaboutscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Annual-Report-2015-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], '''setae''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|t|iː}} (singular  '''seta''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|t|ə}}; from the Latin word for "[[bristle]]") are any of a number of different bristle- or [[hair]]-like structures on living [[organism]]s.

==Animal setae==

===Invertebrates===
[[File:Isonychia Foreleg.jpg|thumb|Setae on the foreleg of a [[mayfly]]]]

[[Annelid]] setae are stiff bristles present on the body. They help, for example, [[earthworm]]s to attach to the surface and prevent backsliding during [[peristaltic]] motion. These hairs make it difficult to pull a worm straight from the ground.

It captures them and allows them to be eaten.

Setae on the [[integument]] of insects are unicellular, meaning that each is formed from a single epidermal cell of a type called a trichogen, literally meaning "bristle generator".  They are at first hollow and in most forms remain hollow after they have hardened.  They grow through and project through a secondary or accessory cell of a type called a tormogen, which generates the special flexible membrane that connects the base of the seta to the surrounding [[integument]]. Depending partly on their form and function, setae may be called hairs, '''macrotrichia''', '''[[chaeta]]e''', or '''[[Scale (insect anatomy)|scales]]'''. The setal membrane is not cuticularized and movement is possible. Some insects, such as ''Eriogaster lanestris'' larvae, use setae as a defense mechanism, as they can cause dermatitis when they come into contact with skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1841743/pdf/brmedj02134-0044.pdf|title=Caterpillar Dermatitis | pmc=1841743 | pmid=6023131|volume=2|year=1967|journal=Br Med J|pages=346–8 | last1 = Hellier | first1 = FF | last2 = Warin | first2 = RP | doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5548.346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gecko foot on glass.JPG|thumb|right|Close-up of the underside of a gecko's foot as it walks on vertical glass]]

The pads on a [[gecko]]'s feet are small hair-like [[process (anatomy)|process]]es that play a role in the animal's ability to cling to vertical surfaces.  The micrometer-scale setae branch into nanometer-scale projections called [[Spatulae (biology)|spatulae]].&lt;ref name=Santos2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=Santos |first=Daniel |author2=Matthew Spenko |author3=Aaron Parness |author4=Kim Sangbae |author5=Mark Cutkosky|title=Directional adhesion for climbing: theoretical and practical considerations  |journal=Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology  |year=2007 |volume=21 |issue=12–13 |pages=1317–1341|issn=0169-4243|doi=10.1163/156856107782328399 |quote=''Gecko "feet and toes are a hierarchical system of complex structures consisting of lamellae, setae, and spatulae. The distinguishing characteristics of the gecko adhesion system have been described [as] (1) anisotropic attachment, (2) high pulloff force to preload ratio, (3) low detachment force, (4) material independence, (5) self-cleaning, (6) anti-self sticking and (7) non-sticky default state. ... The gecko’s adhesive structures are made from ß-keratin (modulus of elasticity [approx.] 2 GPa). Such a stiff material is not inherently sticky; however, because of the gecko adhesive’s hierarchical nature and extremely small distal features (spatulae are [approx.] 200 nm in size), the gecko’s foot is able to intimately conform to the surface and generate significant attraction using van der Waals forces.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gekko's seta: According to Kellar Autumn, "Two front feet of a tokay gecko (''[[Gekko gecko]]'') can withstand 20.1 N of force parallel to the surface with 227 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of pad area (Irschick et al. 1996). The foot of a tokay bears approximately 3600 tetrads of setae per mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or 14,400 setae per mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (Schleich and Kastle 1986; pers- obs-)- Consequently, a single seta should produce an average force of 6-2 pN, and an average shear stress of 0-090 N mm&lt;sup&gt;−l&lt;/sup&gt; (0.9 atm). However, single setae proved both much less sticky and much more sticky than predicted by whole animal measurements, under varying experimental conditions, implying that attachment and detachment in gecko setae are mechanically controlled (Autumn et al. 2000)."&lt;ref&gt;Properties, Principles, and Parameters of the Gecko Adhesive System&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fungal setae==
In [[mycology]], "setae" refer to dark brown, thick-walled, thorn-like [[cystidia]] found in [[corticioid fungi|corticioid]] and [[polypores|poroid fungi]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Hymenochaetaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kirk PM, Cannon PF, Minter DW, Stalpers JA |title=Dictionary of the Fungi |edition=10th |publisher=CABI |location=Wallingford |year=2008|page=116|isbn=978-0-85199-826-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though mainly microscopic, the setae of some species may be sufficiently prominent to be visible with a hand lens.

==Plant setae==
In [[botany]], "seta" refers to the stalk supporting the [[sporangium|capsule]] of a [[moss]] or [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]], and supplying it with nutrients. The seta is part of the [[sporophyte]] and has a short foot embedded in the [[gametophyte]] on which it is [[parasitic]]. Setae are not present in all mosses, but in some [[species]] they may reach 15 to 20 centimeters in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[Peter H. Raven|Raven, Peter H.]]; Evert, R.F. &amp; Eichhorn, S.E.}} (2005): ''[[Biology of Plants]]'' (7th ed.). W.H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chaetoceros setae==
In the diatom family [[Chaetocerotaceae]], "seta" refers to the hairlike outgrowths of the valve, i.e. of the face of the cells.&lt;ref name=Tomas97&gt;Tomas, C. R., Hasle G. R., Syvertsen, E. E., Steidinger, K. A., Tangen, K., Throndsen, J., Heimdal, B. R., (1997).  ''Identifying Marine Phytoplankton'', Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These setae have a different structure than the valve. Such setae may prevent rapid sinking and also protect the cells from grazing.

==Synthetic setae==
[[Synthetic setae]] are a class of synthetic [[adhesive]]s that detach at will, sometimes called resetable adhesives, yet display substantial stickiness.  The development of such synthetic materials is a matter of current research.&lt;ref name=Santos2007/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news120845139.html|title=Engineers create new adhesive that mimics gecko toe hairs|author=|date=|website=physorg.com|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/search/search.php?search=+Gecko%2Bsetae Setae Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606060332/http://www.physorg.com/search/search.php?search=+Gecko+setae |date=2011-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engeström maintained that "Social network theory fails to recognise such real-world dynamics because its notion of sociality is limited to just people." Instead, he proposed what he called "object centered sociality," citing the work of the sociologist [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]]. For example, Engeström maintained that much of the success of the popular photo-sharing site [[Flickr]] was because photographs serve as social objects around which conversations of social networks form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engeström|first=Jyri|title=Why some social network services work and others don’t — Or: the case for object-centered sociality|url=http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2005/04/why-some-social-network-services-work-and-others-dont-or-the-case-for-object-centered-sociality.html|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Software engineer]]s form part of the workforce around the world. As of 2016, it is estimated that there are 21 million professional software developers.&lt;ref name="SO2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evansdata.com/reports/viewRelease.php?reportID=9|title=Global Developer Population and Demographic Study 2016 V2|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Evans Data Corporation]]|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
As of 2016, it was estimated that 3.87 million professional software developers worked in the US&lt;ref name="SO2016" /&gt; out of a total employed workforce of 152 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Labor Force Statistics Seasonally Adjusted|url=http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/laus/us/usadj.htm|website=Labor Market Information|publisher=Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2.54%).

=== Summary ===
{{update|date=November 2010}}
Based on data from the [[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]] from 2002, about 612,000 software engineers worked in the U.S. - about one out of every 200 workers. There were 55% to 60% as many software engineers as all traditional engineers. This comparison holds whether one compares the number of practitioners, managers, educators, or technicians/programmers. Software engineering had 612,000 practitioners; 264,790 managers, 16,495 educators, and 457,320 programmers.

=== Software Engineers Versus Traditional Engineers ===
The following two tables compare the number of software engineers (611,900), versus the number of traditional engineers (1,157,020). The ratio is 53%.

There are another 1,500,000 people in system analysis, system administration, and computer support, many of whom might be called software engineers. Many systems analysts manage software development teams and analysis is an important software engineering role, so many of them might be considered software engineers in the near future. This means that the number of software engineers may actually be much higher.

Note also that the number of software engineers declined by 5% to 10% from 2000 to 2002.

=== Software Engineering Educators Versus Engineering Educators ===
{{tone|section|date=January 2014}}
Until now, computer science has been the main degree to acquire, whether one wanted to make software systems (software engineering) or study the theoretical and mathematical facets of software systems (computer science). The data shows that the number of chemistry and physics educators (29,610) nearly equals the number of engineering educators (29,310). It is estimated that similarly, {{frac|1|2}} of computer science educators emphasize the practical (software engineering) (16,495) and {{frac|1|2}} of computer science educators emphasize the theoretical (computer science) (16,495). This means that software engineering education is 56% the size of traditional engineering education. Computer science is larger than all engineering, and larger than all physics and chemistry.

=== Relation to IT demographics ===
Software engineers are part of the much larger software, hardware, application, and operations community. In 2000 in the U.S., there were about 680,000 software engineers and about 10,000,000 IT workers.

There are no numbers on testers in the BLS data.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== India ==
There has been a healthy growth in the number of India's IT professionals over the past few years. From a base of 6,800 [[knowledge worker]]s in 1985-86, the number increased to 522,000 software and services professionals by the end of 2001-02. It is estimated that out of these 528,000 knowledge workers, almost 170,000 are working in the IT software and services export industry; nearly 106,000 are working in the IT enabled services and over 230,000 in user organizations.&lt;ref&gt;From [http://www.nasscom.org Website of the National Association of Software and Service Companies], one of the more authoritative sources of information.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the web design technique of combining images into a single bitmap to save memory|texture atlas}}

'''Sprite''' is a [[computer graphics]] term for a [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] [[bitmap]] that is integrated into a larger scene.

Originally sprites referred to independent objects that are composited together, by hardware, with other elements such as a background.&lt;ref name="dadgum"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hague|first1=James|title=Why Do Dedicated Game Consoles Exist?|url=http://prog21.dadgum.com/181.html|website=dadgum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition occurs as each [[scan line]] is prepared for the video output device, such as a [[cathode ray tube|CRT]], without involvement of the main [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and without the need for a full-screen [[frame buffer]].&lt;ref name="dadgum"/&gt; Sprites can be positioned or altered by setting attributes used during the hardware composition process. Examples of systems with hardware sprites include the [[Atari 8-bit family]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Sega Genesis]], and many coin-operated [[arcade machine]]s of the 1980s. Sprite hardware varies in how many sprites are supported, how many can be displayed on a single scan line (which is often a lower number), the dimensions and colors of each sprite, and special effects such as scaling or reporting pixel-precise overlap.

Use of the term ''sprite'' has expanded to refer to any two-dimensional bitmap used as part of a graphics display, even if drawn into a frame buffer (by either software or a [[GPU]]) instead of being composited on-the-fly at display time.

The act of manually creating sprites, as opposed to pre-rendering them or using digitized images, is a form of [[pixel art]]. It is sometimes referred to as ''spriting'', especially in the hobbyist community.

==History==
The use of sprites originated with [[arcade game]]s. The first video game to represent [[player character]]s as human player images was [[Taito]]'s ''[[List of Taito games|Basketball]]'', which was licensed in February 1974 to [[Midway Games|Midway]], releasing it as ''TV Basketball'' in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allincolorforaquarter.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/video-game-firsts.html Video Game Firsts], The Golden Age Arcade Historian (November 22, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=wide-flyer&amp;db=videodb&amp;id=4036&amp;image=2 ''Basketball'' Flyer] (1974), Arcade Flyer Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Signetics]] devised the first chips capable of generating sprite graphics (referred to as ''objects'' by Signetics) for home systems. The Signetics 2636 video processors were first used in the 1978 [[1292 Advanced Programmable Video System]] and later in the 1979 [[Elektor TV Games Computer]].

The [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]], released in 1977, features a hardware sprite implementation where five graphical objects can be moved independently of the game playfield.  The term ''sprite'' was not in use at the time. The VCS's sprites are called ''movable objects'' in the programming manual, further identified as two ''players'', two ''missiles'', and one ''ball''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Steve|title=Stella Programmer's Guide|url=http://atarihq.com/danb/files/stella.pdf|date=December 3, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; These each consist of a single row of pixels that are displayed on a [[scan line]].  To produce a two-dimensional shape, the sprite's single-row bitmap is altered by software from one scan line to the next.

The 1979 [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400 and 800]] home computers feature similar, but more elaborate, circuitry capable of moving eight single-color objects per scan line: four 8-bit wide ''players'' and four 2-bit wide ''missiles''. Each is the full height of the display&amp;mdash;a long, thin strip. [[Direct memory access|DMA]] from a table in memory automatically sets the graphics pattern registers for each scan line. Hardware registers control the horizontal position of each player and missile. Vertical motion is achieved by moving the bitmap data within a player or missile's strip. The feature was called ''player/missile graphics'' by Atari.

The [[Namco Galaxian]] [[arcade system board]], for the 1979 arcade game ''[[Galaxian]]'', featured animated, multi-colored sprites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YVTNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|title=The Golden Age of Video Games: The Birth of a Multibillion Dollar Industry|first=Roberto|last=Dillon|date=19 April 2016|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It pioneered a sprite system that animated pre-loaded sprites over a [[scrolling]] background, which became the basis for [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Radar Scope]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' arcade hardware and [[home console]]s such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120505103737/www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/making-the-famicom-a-reality/ Making the Famicom a Reality], ''Nikkei Electronics'' (September 12, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steve Golson from [[General Computer Corporation]], the term "stamp" was used instead of "sprite" at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Steve Golson |date= |year=2016 |title=Classic Game Postmortem: 'Ms. Pac-Man' |trans-title= |medium=Conference |language=English |url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023366/Classic-Game-Postmortem-Ms-Pac |access-date=2017-01-26 |format= |time=20:30 |location= |publisher=[[Game Developers Conference]] |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=[…] 6 moving characters, what you would call today "sprites" we called them "stamps" back then, […].|ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''sprite'' was first used in the graphic sense by one of the definers of the [[Texas Instruments]] [[TMS9918|9918(A)]] video display processor (VDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.ti/msg/73e2451bcae4d91a |title=Karl Guttag Conference on Delphi TI Net - comp.sys.ti &amp;#124; Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was derived from the fact that sprites, rather than being part of the bitmap data in the framebuffer, instead "floated" around on top without affecting the data in the framebuffer below, much like a ghost or "[[Sprite (folklore)|sprite]]". By this time, sprites had advanced to the point where complete two-dimensional shapes could be moved around the screen horizontally and vertically with minimal software overhead.

==Systems with hardware sprites==
These are base hardware specs and don't include additional programming techniques, such as using [[raster interrupt]]s to repurpose sprites mid-frame.

== Use in 3D rendering ==
{{original research|section|date=November 2016}}
2D images with alpha channels constrained to face the camera may be used in [[3D graphics]]. They are common for rendering vegetation, to approximate distant objects, or for [[particle effects]]. These are sometimes called "billboards" or "Z-sprites". If rendered on the fly to cache an approximate view of an underlying [[3D model]], such sprites are called ''impostors''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GPU Gems NVIDIA Developer|url=https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch21.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern GPU hardware can mimic sprites with two texture-mapped triangles or specific primitives such as [[point sprites]].

== Synonyms ==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2016}}
Some hardware makers used terms other than ''sprite''.

'''Player/Missile Graphics''' was a term used by [[Atari, Inc.]] for hardware-generated sprites in the company's early [[coin-op]] games, the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 5200|5200]] consoles, and the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit computers]].&lt;ref name=dere&gt;{{cite web|title=De Re Atari|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/dere/chapt04.php|website=archive.org|date=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term reflected the usage for both characters ("players") and smaller associated objects ("missiles") that share the same color.

&lt;span id="MOB"&gt;'''Movable Object Block''', or '''MOB'''&lt;/span&gt;, was used in [[MOS Technology]]'s graphics chip literature (data sheets, etc.) However, [[Commodore International|Commodore]], the main user of MOS chips and the owner of MOS for most of the chip maker's lifetime, used the term ''sprite'' for the Commodore 64.

The developer manuals for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], and [[Game Boy]] refer to sprites as '''OBJ'''s (short for "objects"), and the region of RAM used to store sprite attributes and coordinates was known as '''OAM''' (Object Attribute Memory). This also applies on the [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Nintendo DS]] handheld systems.

'''''The Inner Reaches of Outer Space''''' is a 1986 book by [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]], the last book completed before his death in 1987. In it, he explores the intersections of art, psychology and religion, and discusses the ways in which new myths are born. In writing the book, Campbell drew on transcripts of a series of lectures and conversations that he gave in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] between 1981–1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Inner Reaches of Outer Space|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|publisher=New World Library|year=2002|isbn=9781577312093|location=Novato, California|pages=xi|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including legendary symposiums with astronaut [[Rusty Schweickart]] and with members of the [[Grateful Dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|publisher=New World Library|year=2003|isbn=978-1577314042|location=Novato, California|pages=xxii, xxxi, 180|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally published by [[Alfred van der Mark]] in 1986, the book was rereleased by [[Harper &amp; Row]] in 1988. With the publication of the third edition by [[New World Library]] in 2002, ''The Inner Reaches of Outer Space'' became the second title in the [[Joseph Campbell Foundation]]'s ''[[Collected Works of Joseph Campbell]]'' series.

In [[medicine]], "'''topographical codes'''" (or "topography codes") are codes that indicate a specific location in the body.

==Examples==
Only the first of these is a system dedicated only to topography. The others are more generalized systems that contain topographic axes.

== History ==
The term "transhumanism" with its present meaning was popularised by [[Julian Huxley]]'s 1957 essay of that name.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1957"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Huxley, Julian| title = Transhumanism| year = 1957| url = http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley/| accessdate = February 24, 2006| authorlink = Julian Huxley| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160625132722/http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley| archivedate = June 25, 2016| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natasha Vita-More]] was elected as a Councilperson for the 28th Senatorial District of Los Angeles in 1992. She ran with the Green Party, but on a personal platform of "transhumanism". She quit after a year, saying her party was "too neurotically geared toward environmentalism".&lt;ref name=rothman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/10/08/transhumanism-gets-political/|title=Transhumanism Gets Political|last=Rothman|first=Peter|date=8 October 2014|accessdate=7 July 2015|publisher=hplusmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=James|title=The Politics of Transhumanism|url=http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm#_ftn2|website=changesurfer.com|accessdate=18 August 2016|quote=Ironically, Natasha Vita-More was actually elected to Los Angeles public office on the Green Party ticket in 1992. However her platform was “transhumanism” and she quit after one year of her two year term because the Greens were “too far left and too neurotically geared toward environmentalism.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] identifies the "neoliberal" [[Extropy Institute]], founded by philosopher [[Max More]] and developed in the 1990s, as the first organized advocates for transhumanism.  And he identifies the late-1990s formation of the World Transhumanist Association (WTA), a European organization which later was renamed to [[Humanity+]] (H+), as partly a reaction to the free market perspective of the "Extropians". Per Hughes, "[t]he WTA included both social democrats and neoliberals around a liberal democratic definition of transhumanism, codified in the Transhumanist Declaration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=James|title=Transhumanist politics, 1700 to the near future|publisher=[[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]]|date=10 April 2009|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/hughes20090409/|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hughes-zygon&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=James|title=The Politics of Transhumanism and the Techno-Millennial Imagination, 1626-2030|publisher=[[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]]|date=1 May 2013|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/hughes20130501|accessdate=13 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes has also detailed the political currents in transhumanism, particularly the shift around 2009 from socialist transhumanism to [[Libertarian transhumanism|libertarian]] and [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] transhumanism.&lt;ref name=hughes-zygon/&gt; He claims that the [[Left-wing politics|left]] was pushed out of the [[Humanity+|World Transhumanist Association]] Board of Directors, and that libertarians and [[Singularitarianism|Singularitarians]] have secured a hegemony in the transhumanism community with help from [[Peter Thiel]], but Hughes remains optimistic about a [[Techno-progressivism|techno-progressive]] future.&lt;ref name=hughes-zygon/&gt;

Writing for ''[[H+ Magazine]]'' in July 2014, futurist Peter Rothman called [[Gabriel Rothblatt]] "very possibly the first openly transhumanist political candidate in the United States" when he ran as a candidate for the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothman|first=Peter|title=Interview: Gabriel Rothblatt Congressional Candidate in Florida's 8th District|publisher=[[Humanity+]]|date=1 July 2014|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/07/01/interview-gabriel-rothblatt-congressional-candidate-in-floridas-8th-district/|accessdate=13 January 2015|quote=I recently got together with Congressional candidate Gabriel Rothblatt who is very possibly the first openly transhumanist political candidate in the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Core values ==
According to a 2006 study by the [[European Parliament]], transhumanism is the political expression of the ideology that technology should be used to enhance human abilities.&lt;ref name="European Parliament 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[European Parliament]]|title=Technology Assessment on Converging Technologies|year=2006|at=ii|quote="On the one side are the true believers in the potential of technology to make individuals ever more perfect.

According to Amon Twyman of the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] (IEET), political philosophies which support transhumanism include social futurism, [[techno-progressivism]], [[techno-libertarianism]], and anarcho-transhumanism.&lt;ref name=amon&gt;{{cite web|last=Twyman|first=Amon|title=Transhumanism and Politics|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/twyman20141007|website=[[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]]|date=7 October 2014|quote=I would suggest that the way forward is to view transhumanism as a kind of political vector, axis, or hub rather than a single party or philosophy.

'''Democratic transhumanism''', a term coined by [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] in 2002, refers to the stance of [[transhumanist]]s (advocates for the development and use of [[human enhancement]] technologies) who espouse [[social liberalism|liberal]], [[social democracy|social]], and/or [[Radical democracy|radical democratic]] political views.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = [[James Hughes (sociologist)|Hughes, James]]|    title = Politics of Transhumanism|    year = 2001 |   url = http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm| accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Hughes, James|    title = Democratic Transhumanism 2.0|    year = 2002 |   url = http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/DemocraticTranshumanism.htm| accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hughes, James |title=Better Health through Democratic Transhumanism |year=2003 |url=http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/240/Default.aspx |accessdate=2007-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011033709/http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/240/Default.aspx |archivedate=2006-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"&gt;{{cite book| author = Hughes, James| title = [[Citizen Cyborg]]: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future| publisher = Westview Press| year = 2004| isbn = 0-8133-4198-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy ===
According to Hughes, the ideology "stems from the assertion that human beings will generally be [[happiness|happier]] when they take [[human agency|rational control]] of the natural and social forces that control their lives."&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

While raising objections both to [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] and [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Techno-progressivism#Contrasting stance|bioconservatism]], and [[libertarian transhumanism]], Hughes aims to encourage democratic transhumanists and their potential [[progressivism|progressive]] allies to unite as a [[new social movement]] and influence [[biopolitical]] [[public policy]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

An attempt to expand the middle ground between [[technorealism]] and [[techno-utopianism]], democratic transhumanism can be seen as a radical form of [[techno-progressivism]].&lt;ref name="Carrico 8-2005"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = [[Dale Carrico|Carrico, Dale]]|    title =  Listen, Transhumanist!|    year = 2005 |   url = http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2005/08/listen-transhumanist.html| accessdate=2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Appearing several times in Hughes' work, the term "radical" (from Latin ''rādīx, rādīc-'', root) is used as an adjective meaning ''of or pertaining to the root'' or ''going to the root''. His central thesis is that [[emerging technologies]] and [[radical democracy]] can help [[citizen]]s overcome some of the ''root causes'' of inequalities of [[Power (philosophy)|power]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002"/&gt;

According to Hughes, the terms techno-progressivism and democratic transhumanism both refer to the same set of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values and principles; however, the term technoprogressive has replaced the use of the word democratic transhumanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Criticism ===

Self-identified libertarian transhumanists, such as [[Ronald Bailey]] of [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'' magazine]] and [[Glenn Reynolds]] of [[Instapundit]], are advocates of the asserted "right to [[human enhancement]]" who argue that the [[free market]] is the best guarantor of this right, claiming that it produces greater prosperity and personal freedom than other economic systems.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2005 LB"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bailey, Ronald|title=Liberation Biology: The Scientific and Moral Case For the Biotech Revolution|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=2005|isbn=1-59102-227-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds 2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reynolds, Glenn |title=[[An Army of Davids]]: How Markets and Technology Empower Ordinary People to Beat Big Media, Big Government, and Other Goliaths|publisher=Thomas Nelson|year=2006|isbn=1-59555-054-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principles ===
Libertarian transhumanists believe that the principle of [[self-ownership]] is the most fundamental idea from which both libertarianism and transhumanism stem. They are [[Rational egoism|rational egoists]] and [[Ethical egoism|ethical egoists]] who embrace the prospect of using [[emerging technologies]] to enhance human capacities, which they believe stems from the self-interested application of [[reason]] and [[will (philosophy)|will]] in the context of the individual [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] to achieve a [[posthuman]] state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. They extend this rational and ethical egoism to advocate a form of "[[biolibertarianism]]".&lt;ref name="Bailey 2005 LB"/&gt;

As strong [[Civil libertarianism|civil libertarians]], libertarian transhumanists hold that any attempt to limit or suppress the asserted right to human enhancement is a violation of [[civil rights]] and [[civil liberties]]. However, as strong [[Economic liberalism|economic libertarian]]s, they also reject proposed [[public policy|public policies]] of [[regulation of science|government-regulated]] and -[[universal health care|insured]] [[human enhancement technologies]], which are advocated by [[Democratic transhumanism|democratic transhumanists]], because they fear that any [[Interventionism (politics)|state intervention]] will steer or limit their choices.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2005 THE"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Bailey, Ronald | title = Trans-Human Expressway: Why libertarians will win the future | year = 2005 | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/34971.html | accessdate=2006-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Dale Carrico|Carrico, Dale]] | title = Bailey on the CybDemite Menace | year = 2005 | url = http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2005/05/bailey-on-cybdemite-menace.html | accessdate = 2006-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey 2009"/&gt;

[[Extropianism]], the earliest [[Transhumanism#Currents|current of transhumanist thought]] defined in 1988 by philosopher [[Max More]], initially included an [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] interpretation of the concept of  "[[spontaneous order]]" in its principles, which states that a free market economy achieves a more efficient allocation of societal resources than any [[Planned economy|planned]] or [[mixed economy]] could achieve. In 2000, while revising the principles of Extropy, More seemed to be abandoning libertarianism in favor of [[Social liberalism|modern liberalism]] and [[anticipatory democracy]]. However, many Extropians remained libertarian transhumanists.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2001"/&gt;

=== Criticisms ===
Critiques of the [[techno-utopianism]] of libertarian transhumanists from progressive [[cultural critic]]s include [[Richard Barbrook]] and Andy Cameron's 1995 essay ''The Californian Ideology''; [[Mark Dery]]'s 1996 book ''Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century''; and [[Paulina Borsook]]'s 2000 book ''Cyberselfish: A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian Culture of High-Tech''.

Barbrook argues that libertarian transhumanists are proponents of the [[Californian Ideology]] who embrace the goal of [[reactionary modernism]]: [[economic growth]] without [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barbrook, Richard |author2=Cameron, Andy | title = The Californian Ideology |  year = 2000 |  url = http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/theory-californianideology.html | accessdate = 2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Barbrook, libertarian transhumanists are unwittingly appropriating the theoretical legacy of [[Stalinism|Stalinist communism]] by substituting, among other concepts, the "[[vanguard party]]" with the "[[digerati]]", and the "[[new Soviet man]]" with the "[[posthuman]]".&lt;ref name="Barbrook"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Barbrook, Richard | title = Cyber-Communism: How the Americans Are Superseding Capitalism in Cyberspace | year = 2007 | url = http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/cyber-communism-how-the-americans-are-superseding-capitalism-in-cyberspace/ | accessdate = 2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dery coined the dismissive phrase "body-loathing" to describe the attitude of libertarian transhumanists and those in the [[cyberculture]] who want to escape from their "[[Human body|meat puppet]]" through [[mind uploading]] into [[cyberspace]].&lt;ref name="Dery 1996"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Mark Dery|Dery, Mark]] | title = Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century | publisher = Grove Press | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-8021-3520-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borsook asserts that libertarian transhumanists indulge in a [[subculture]] of [[selfishness]], [[elitism]], and [[escapism]].&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"&gt;{{cite book| author = Borsook, Paulina | title = Cyberselfish: A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian Culture of High-Tech |publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | year = 2000 | url = https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2000/11/cyberselfish-redux | isbn = 1-891620-78-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] is the most militant critic of libertarian transhumanism. While articulating "democratic transhumanism" as a sociopolitical program in his 2004 book ''[[Citizen Cyborg]]'',&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; Hughes sought to convince libertarian transhumanists to embrace [[social democracy]] by arguing that:
# [[State (polity)|State]] action is required to address [[existential risk|catastrophic threats]] from transhumanist technologies;
# Only believable and effective [[public policy|public policies]] to prevent adverse consequences from new technologies will reassure skittish publics that they do not have to be [[ban (law)|banned]];
# [[Social policy|Social policies]] must explicitly address public concerns that transhumanist biotechnologies will exacerbate [[social inequality]];
# [[Monopoly|Monopolistic]] practices and overly restrictive [[intellectual property]] law can seriously delay the development of transhumanist technologies, and restrict their access;
# Only a strong [[liberal democratic]] state can ensure that posthumans are not [[persecution|persecuted]]; and
# Libertarian transhumanists (who are [[antinaturalism (politics)|anti-naturalists]]) are inconsistent in arguing for the free market [[appeal to nature|on the grounds that it is a natural phenomenon]].

Klaus-Gerd Giesen, a German political scientist specializing in the [[philosophy of technology]], wrote a critique of the libertarianism he imputes to all transhumanists. While pointing out that the works of [[Austrian School]] economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] figure in practically all of the recommended reading lists of [[Extropians]], he argues that transhumanists, convinced of the sole virtues of the free market, advocate an unabashed [[social Darwinism|inegalitarianism]] and merciless [[meritocracy]] which can be reduced in reality to a biological [[fetishism|fetish]]. He is especially critical of their promotion of a science-fictional [[liberal eugenics]], virulently opposed to any political regulation of [[human genetics]], where the [[consumerism|consumerist]] model presides over their ideology. Giesen concludes that the despair of finding social and political solutions to today's sociopolitical problems incites transhumanists to [[genetic determinism|reduce everything to the hereditary gene]], as a fantasy of [[omnipotence]] to be found within the individual, even if it means transforming the subject ([[human]]) to a new draft (posthuman).&lt;ref name="Giesen 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Giesen, Klaus-Gerd | title = Transhumanisme et génétique humaine | year = 2004 | url = http://www.ircm.qc.ca/bioethique/obsgenetique/cadrages/cadr2004/c_no16_04/c_no16_04_01.html | accessdate = 2006-04-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070310224959/http://www.ircm.qc.ca/bioethique/obsgenetique/cadrages/cadr2004/c_no16_04/c_no16_04_01.html | archivedate = 2007-03-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Video design''' or '''projection design''' is a creative field of stagecraft. It is concerned with the creation and integration of film, motion graphics and live camera feed into the fields of [[theatre]], [[opera]], [[dance]], [[fashion shows]], [[concerts]] and other live events. Video design has only recently gained recognition as a separate creative field. Prior to this, the responsibilities of video design would often be taken on by a [[scenic designer]] or [[lighting designer]]. A person who practices the art of video design is often known as a '''Video Designer'''. However, naming conventions vary around the world, and so practitioners may also be credited as '''Projection Designer''', "Media Designer", '''[[Cinematographer]]''' or '''Video Director''' (amongst others). As a relatively new field of stagecraft, practitioners create their own definitions, rules and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projctn.com/about-projection-design|title=About Projection Design  - Projctn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Filmmaking]] and [[video production]] content has been used in performance for many years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/theater/18mcelroy.html|title=Projection Design Comes of Age|first=Steven|last=Mcelroy|date=18 May 2008|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has large format [[slide projection]] delivered by systems such as the PANI projector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pani.com/unternehmen/daten/e_daten.html?english |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926111206/http://www.pani.com/unternehmen/daten/e_daten.html?english |archivedate=September 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Erwin Piscator]], as stage director at the Berlin [[Volksbühne]] in the 1920s, made extensive use of film projected onto his sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://myclone.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/field-guide-to-new-media-for-the-performing-arts/|title=Field Guide to New Media for the Performing Arts|first=David|last=Haden|date=28 January 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the development of digital projection technology in the mid 90s, and the resulting drop in price, made it more attractive and practical to live performance producers, directors and scenic designers. The role of the video designer has developed as a response to this, and in recognition of the demand in the industry for experienced professionals to handle the video content of a production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livedesignonline.com/theatre/projection_designer_scenic_tony_award_0430/|title=Sunday In The Park Projection Designer Being Considered For Scenic Tony Award|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Scenic Artists]]' Local 829, the Union representing [[Scenic Artists]] in the USA has included "Projection Designers" as of mid- 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usa829.org/News.aspx?ItemID=109|title=News|first=|last=USA829|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means anybody working in this field will be doing so officially as "Projection Designer" if he or she is working under a union contract, even if the design utilises technology other than [[video projectors]]. The term "Projection Designer" stems from the days when slide and film projectors were the primary source of projection and is now in wide use across North America.

[http://www.arts.ac.uk/wimbledon/courses/postgraduate/ma-digital-theatre/ MA Digital Theatre], [[University of the Arts London]]  is the first Master's level course in the UK designed to teach video design exclusively as a specific discipline, rather than embedding it into scenic design. 
Also, Opera Academy Verona has a Workshop Laboratory from 2009 of Projection Design for Opera and Theatre, Directed from Carlo Saleti, Gianfranco Veneruci and Florian CANGA.

In the USA,  a number of programs started at about the same time reflecting the growing acceptance of the profession and the need for skilled projection designers. [[Yale University]] began a graduate level program in Projection Design in 2010.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yale.edu/2009/10/30/school-drama-adds-new-concentration-projection-design|title=School of Drama Adds New Concentration in Projection Design|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's being headed by [[Wendall K. Harrington]]. [[CalArts]] had their concentration Video For Performance [https://theater.calarts.edu/programs/design-and-production/video-performance] since the mid-2000s and is currently led by Peter Flaherty while [[UT Austin]] started the MFA concentration [http://www.utexas.edu/finearts/tad/images/integrated-media/  Integrated Media for Live Performance]  also in 2010. It is being led by the Sven Ortel. Both the UT Austin and Yale program are part of an MFA in Design and graduated their first students in 2013.

== Roles of the video designer ==

Depending on the production, and due to the crossover of this field with the fields of [[lighting design]] and [[scenic design]], a video designer's roles and responsibilities may vary from show to show. A video designer may take responsibility for any or all of the following.

* The overall conceptual design of the video content to be included in the piece, including working with the other members of the [[production team]] to ensure that the video content is integrated with the other design areas.
* The creation of this video content using [[animation|2D]] and [[3D animation]], [[motion graphics]], [[stop motion animation]], [[illustration]], [[filming]] or any other method.
* The management of live cameras, their signal and how it is used on stage as part of the design. 
* The [[Film Director|direction]], lighting and/or [[cinematography]] of any film clips included in the piece.
* The design of the technical system to deliver the video content, including the specification of [[video projectors]], [[LED display]]s, monitors and control systems, cabling routes and rigging positions for optimal video effects. 
* The management of the budget allocated to video, including the sourcing of display technologies and control technologies, their delivery, maintenance and insurance.

This is a very wide skills base, and it is not uncommon for a video designer to work with associates or assistants who can take responsibility for certain areas. For example, a video designer may conceptually design the video content, but hire a skilled [[animator]] to create it, a programmer to program the control system, a production engineer to designer and engineer the control system and a [[projectionist]] to choose the optimum projection positions and maintain the equipment.

== Concert video design ==
&lt;!-- "Concert video design" redirects here. Please update redirect if retitling section. --&gt;

'''Concert video design''' is a niche of the [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]] industry that involves the creation of original video content intended explicitly for display during a live [[concert]] performance.

The creation of visuals for live music performances bears close resemblance to [[music videos]], but are typically meant to be displayed as 'backplate' imagery that adds a visual component to the music performed onstage. However, as the use of video content during musical performances has grown in popularity since the turn of the 21st century, it has become more common to have self-standing 'introductory' and 'interstitial' videos that play on screen on stage without the performers. These pieces may include footage of the artist or artists, shot specifically for the video, and presented onstage with pre-recorded music so that the final appearance is essentially a music video. Such stand-alone videos, however, are typically only viewed in this live setting and may include additional theatrical [[sound effects]].

The earliest concert video visuals likely date to the period of the late 1960s when concerts for artists such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[The Doors]] featured [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] imagery on projection screens suspended behind the performers. Live concert performances took on more and more theatrical elements particularly notable in the concert events put on by [[Pink Floyd]] throughout their career.

[[Laurie Anderson]] was among the earliest to experiment with video content as part of a live performance, and her ideas and images continue to be a direct inspiration to performers as diverse as [[David Bowie]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Kanye West]]. Meanwhile, in 1982, [[Devo]] integrated rear-projected visuals into their concert set, choreographing themselves to match and interact with the action on screen for several songs. But the rock show that made video content 'standard practice' was [[U2]]'s [[Zoo TV Tour]] conceived and designed by [[Willie Williams (set designer)|Willie Williams]] - who has collaborated with [[Laurie Anderson]].

== Technology used in video design ==

Video designers make use of many technologies from the fields of [[stagecraft]], broadcast equipment and home cinema equipment to build a workable video system, including technologies developed specifically for live video and technologies appropriated from other fields. A video system may include any of the following:
