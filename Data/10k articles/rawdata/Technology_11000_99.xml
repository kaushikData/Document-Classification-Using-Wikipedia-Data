'''Air stripline''' is a form of electrical [[planar transmission line]] whereby a conductor in the form of a thin metal strip is suspended between two [[ground plane]]s.  The idea is to make the [[dielectric]] essentially air.  Mechanical support of the line may be a thin substrate, periodical insulated supports, or the device connectors and other electrical items.

Air stripline is most commonly used at [[microwave]] frequencies, especially in the [[C band (IEEE)|C band]].  Its advantage over standard stripline and other planar technologies is that its air dielectric avoids [[dielectric loss]].  Many useful circuits can be constructed with air stripline and it is also easier to achieve strong coupling between components in this technology than with other planar formats.  It was invented by Robert M. Barrett in the 1950s.

== Structure ==
[[File:Air stripline structure.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Diagram of the structure of dielectric supported air stripline]]
Air stripline is a form of [[stripline]] using air as the [[dielectric]] material between the central conductor and the [[ground plane]]s.  Using air as the dielectric has the advantage that it avoids the [[transmission loss]]es usually [[dielectric loss|associated with dielectric materials]].&lt;ref&gt;Maichen, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic ways that air stripline is constructed.  In dielectric supported stripline, also called suspended stripline or suspended substrate, the strip conductor is deposited on a thin solid dielectric substrate, sometimes on both sides and connected together to form a single conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Oliner, p. 557–558&lt;/ref&gt;  This substrate is then clamped in place between the walls supporting the two ground planes.  In this method the strip can be manufactured by printed circuit techniques making it cheap and leading to the further advantage that other components can be printed on the dielectric in the same operation.  The purpose of the solid dielectric is mechanical support for the conductor,&lt;ref&gt;Rosloniec, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; but it is made as thin as possible to minimise its electrical effect.  The flimsy nature of the substrate means that it can easily be distorted.  Because of this, the design needs to take account of thermal stability issues.&lt;ref&gt;Han &amp; Hwang, p. 21-60&lt;/ref&gt;  High end designs may use a crystalline substrate, such as [[boron nitride]] or [[sapphire]],  as the suspended substrate.&lt;ref&gt;Bhat &amp; Koul, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

The other method of construction uses a more substantial solid metal bar as the strip, supported on periodically spaced insulators.  This method may be more suitable for high power applications.  In such applications the corners of the conductor cross-section may be rounded to prevent high field intensities and [[arcing]] occurring at those points.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Han &amp; Hwang, p. 21-60|Matthaei ''et al.'', p. 172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The insulators are electrically undesirable; they detract from the goal of having a purely air dielectric, add [[Discontinuity (transmission lines)|discontinuities]] to the line, and are potentially a point at which [[electrical treeing|tracking]] can occur.  In some components, there are points at which the lines need to be grounded, either directly or through a discrete component.  In such circuits these grounding points can double as mechanical supports and the need for supporting insulators avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp. 422–423&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Air stripline examples.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Examples of structures possible with air stripline: directional coupler (top left), branch-line coupler (top right), coupled-line bandpass filter (bottom left), and hybrid ring power splitter (bottom right)]]
Air stripline finds its greatest use at [[microwave]] frequencies in the [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] ({{nowrap|4–8 GHz}}).  At these frequencies and below&lt;ref&gt;Pradhan &amp; Barrow, 1977 for instance&lt;/ref&gt; it has the advantage of compactness over [[waveguide]].  Air stripline can be used outside the C band, but at the higher [[Ku band]] ({{nowrap|12–18 GHz}}) waveguide tends to dominate because of its lower loss.&lt;ref&gt;Han &amp; Hwang, pp. 21–7, 21–50&lt;/ref&gt;

At microwave frequencies, passive circuits such as [[distributed element filter|filters]], [[power dividers and directional couplers]] tend to be constructed as [[distributed element circuit]]s.  These circuits can be constructed using any [[transmission line]] format.  The [[coaxial cable|coaxial line]] format commonly used for interconnecting devices has been used for this kind of device construction but is not the most convenient format for manufacturing.  Stripline was developed as a better solution for circuit construction and air stripline too fills this role.&lt;ref&gt;Besser &amp; Gilmore, pp. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;  Air stripline is particularly useful in the C band for creating [[beam forming]] networks from these components.&lt;ref&gt;Han &amp; Hwang, p. 21-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Air stripline can achieve strong indirect coupling in these components more easily than other planar formats.  In standard stripline, coupling is usually achieved by running the lines side-by-side for a distance.  Coupling between the edges of the lines in this way is relatively weak and is limited by the closest distance the lines can be set together.  This limit is governed by the maximum resolution of the printing process and, in power applications, by the [[electric field strength]] between the lines. For this reason, stripline parallel coupled lines are used in directional couplers with a [[Coupling factor (directional couplers)|coupling factor]] no more than {{nowrap|−10 dB}}. Power splitters, with their coupling factor {{nowrap|−3 dB}}, use a direct coupling technique. Air stripline makes use of an alternative arrangement, with lines stacked one atop of the other. This ''broadside coupling'' is much stronger than edge coupling so the lines do not need to be so close to achieve the same coupling factor.  In dielectric supported stripline, this can be achieved by printing the two lines on opposite sides of the dielectric.  Broadside coupling can, of course, be achieved in solid dielectric filled stripline as well with buried line techniques, but that requires additional dielectric layers and additional manufacturing processes.  Another technique available to air stripline to increase coupling is the use of thick rectangular strips to increase side coupling.  This also makes mechanical support easier because the lines are more rigid.&lt;ref&gt;Bhat &amp; Koul, pp. 212, 280–287, 302–311&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Stripline was invented by Robert M Barrett of the US [[Air Force Cambridge Research Center]] in the early 1950s.  Air stripline under the registered mark ''Stripline'' was first manufactured commercially by Airborne Instruments Laboratory (AIL) in the form of suspended stripline.  However, ''stripline'' has since become a generic term for that structure with any dielectric.  The unadorned term ''stripline'' would now likely be assumed to mean stripline with a solid dielectric.  Early on, stripline was the planar technology of choice, but has now been superseded by [[microstrip]] for most general purpose applications, especially mass-produced items.&lt;ref&gt;Oliner, pp. 557–558&lt;/ref&gt;

Consisting of 4500 members, ADSA is involved in research, education, and industry relations. Areas of ADSA focus include:
* care and nutrition of dairy animals;
* management, economics and marketing of dairy farms and product manufacturing;
* sanitation throughout the dairy industry; and,
* processing of dairy-based products, including processing and foods manufacturing ([[milk]], [[cheese]], [[yogurt]], and [[ice cream]]).

ADSA's top priorities are the ''[[Journal of Dairy Science]]'', annual meetings, scientific liaisons with other organizations and agencies, and international development. ADSA is attempting to add value to potential new members through an emphasis on "integration of dairy disciplines from the farm to the table."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adsa.org/ADSA_2006_Strategic_Plan_Final_JUN06[1&amp;#93;.pdf ADSA 2006 Strategic Plan]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the summer of 1905, the Graduate School of Agriculture was held at [[Ohio State University]]. Professor Wilber J. Fraser of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] suggested a permanent "Dairy Instructors and Investigators Association". Attendees decided that Professor Fraser should discuss the matter further with university leaders and, if enough interest was indicated, call an organizational meeting at the 1906 Graduate School of Agriculture to be held at the University of Illinois, Urbana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = | first = | title = The Remaining Charter Members of A.D.S.A. | journal = J.

Although 19 persons appear on the photograph of that first meeting, records indicate only 17 or 18 charter members joined what was then called "National Association of Dairy Instructors and Investigators". At this time, dairy schools existed at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Iowa State University|Iowa State]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]], [[Purdue University|Purdue]], [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]], [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], [[University of Missouri|Missouri]], [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota]], [[University of Guelph|Guelph]] ([[Guelph, Ontario|Ontario]]), and [[University of Illinois|Illinois]].

The second meeting was at the National Dairy Show in Chicago on 11 Oct 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Trout | first = G. Malcolm | authorlink=G.

At this meeting, the name of the organization changed to "Official Dairy Instructors Association".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Graves | first = R R | title = Proceedings of the 28th Annual Meeting of the American Dairy Science Association | journal = J.

The third meeting, held July 22 and 23, 1908 at [[Cornell University]], was a significant success. 69 persons from Canada, 26 states, and the District of Columbia attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Trout | first = G Malcolm | authorlink=G.

At the 10th annual joint meeting in [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]] and [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], on October 17, 1916, the organization voted to change its name to its current name. The name change was effective May 1, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Harding | first = H A | title = Report of Committee on Change of Name | journal = J.

ADSA's [[scientific journal]] is the ''Journal of Dairy Science'' (''JDS'').

''JDS'' is among the top 5 most-cited scientific journals in the [[agriculture]] category.

By 1945, ADSA had 1,407 members. By 1985, ADSA had 3,000 members in 50 countries, owned a headquarters building with a staff of 19, provided management services for 6 other organizations, and published the Journal of Dairy Science and 5 journals for other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dunkley | first = Walter J | title = Business Management of American Dairy Science Association: A Historical Review | journal = J.

'''Ammonium azide''' is the [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, being the salt of [[ammonia]] and [[hydrazoic acid]]. Like other inorganic [[azides]], this colourless crystalline [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] is a powerful explosive, although it has a remarkably low sensitivity. NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is physiologically active and inhalation of small amounts causes headaches and [[palpitations]]. It was first obtained by [[Theodor Curtius]] in 1890, along with other azides.

==Structure==
Ammonium azide is ionic. Ammonium azide contains about 93% [[nitrogen]] by weight as ammonium cation and azide anion. It is a structural isomer of [[tetrazene]].

'''Aracruz Celulose S.A.''' was a [[Brazil]]ian manufacturer of [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] and [[paper]]. In 2009 the company merged with [[Votorantim Celulose e Papel|VCP]] and renamed [[Fibria]]. The new company maintained its headquarters in Sao Paulo, and is a supplier of bleached [[eucalyptus]] pulp. The current presidents are members of the Hungarian family, Ersching.

The company has two pulp making plants, one in [[Aracruz, Espírito Santo|Aracruz]] city in [[Espírito Santo]] state and the other at [[Guaíba]] in the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. It also has forestry operations in these states as well as in the states of [[Bahia]] and [[Minas Gerais]].

The major [[shareholders]] control the company's voting shares: the [[Votorantim]] and [[BNDES]], the Brazilian National Economic and Social Development Bank. ARACRUZ's preferred shares, which constitute over half the company's total outstanding shares, are traded on the São Paulo ([[Bovespa]]), New York and Madrid stock exchanges. These remain the two shareholders of Fibria.

The company was listed on the Stock Exchange of [[Sao Paulo]], [[New York City]] and [[Madrid]] and now as Fibria remains on the [[BM&amp;F Bovespa]] stock exchange of Sao Paulo.

==Biopreservative agents and modes of action==

===Lactic acid bacteria===
Of special interest are [[lactic acid bacteria]] (LAB). Lactic acid bacteria have antagonistic properties which make them particularly useful as biopreservatives. When LABs compete for nutrients, their [[metabolite]]s often include active antimicrobials such as lactic and acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and [[peptide]] [[bacteriocin]]s. Some LABs produce the antimicrobial [[nisin]] which is a particularly effective preservative.&lt;ref name="FAO preservation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alzamora |first1=Stella |last2=Tapia |first2=Maria Soledad |last3=López-Malo |first3=Aurelio |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2gTCY5Dvha4C&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=biopreservation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oQyFTaC8KZa0cOmRvJUD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=biopreservation&amp;f=false |title=Minimally Processed Fruits and Vegetables: Fundamental aspects and applications |publisher=Springer |page=266 |isbn=978-0-8342-1672-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeast===
In addition to lactic acid bacteria, yeasts also have been reported to have a biopreservation effect due to their antagonistic activities relying on the competition for nutrients, production and tolerance of high concentrations of ethanol, as well as the synthesis of a large class of antimicrobial compounds exhibiting large spectrum of activity against food spoilage microorganisms, but also against plant, animal and human pathogen.&lt;ref name=" Muccilli, S et al "&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muccilli | first1 = S. | last2 = Restuccia | first2 = C. | year = 2015 | title = Bioprotective Role of Yeasts | url = | journal = Microorganisms | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 588–611 | doi=10.3390/microorganisms3040588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bacterium/yeast that is a suitable candidate for use as a biopreservative does not necessarily have to ferment the food. However, if conditions are suitable for microbial growth, then a biopreservative bacterium will compete well for nutrients with the spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in the food. As a product of its metabolism, it should also produce acids and other antimicrobial agents, particularly bacteriocins.  Biopreservative bacteria, such as lactic acid bacteria, must be harmless to humans.&lt;ref name="Yousef&amp;Carlstrom"&gt;Yousef AE and Carolyn Carlstrom C (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=aYORXplZq0wC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=biopreservation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3A2FTeqlMIi4cZ2D_JcD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=biopreservation&amp;f=false ''Food microbiology: a laboratory manual''] Wiley, Page 226. {{ISBN|978-0-471-39105-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteriophages===

Bacteriophages (Greek for 'bacteria eater'), or simply phages, are viruses which infect bacteria.&lt;ref name="Lacroix6"&gt;Lacroix, Christophe. (2011). Protective Cultures, Antimicrobial Metabolites and Bacteriophages for Food and Beverage Biopreservation - 6. Bacteriophages and Food Safety. Woodhead Publishing. Online version available at: http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/pdf/id:kt009277EL/protective-cultures-antimicrobial/bacteriophages-food-safety&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of all bacteriophages known exhibit a double-stranded DNA genome inside the virion capsid and belong to the order of tailed phages, Caudovirales. The tailed phages can be further separated into three families: Podoviridae, which are characterized by very short tails; Myoviridae, which exhibit longer, straight and contractile tails; and Siphoviridae, which can be identified due to their long and flexible tails. Another well studied group of phages with many applications, although minor in terms of species diversity, is represented by filamentous phages which exhibit a single stranded DNA genome decorated by a helical protein layer surrounding the DNA molecule.&lt;ref name="Lacroix6" /&gt;  Bacteriophages are ubiquitously distributed in nature and can also be isolated from human or animal associated microflora. They outnumber their bacterial host species by a factor of ten representing the most abundant self-replicating entities on earth with an estimated 1031 phages in total.&lt;ref name=" BRUSSOW H et al "&gt;BRUSSOW H and KUTTER E (2005). 'Phage ecology.' In Kutter E and Sulakvelidze A (eds) Bacteriophages - Biology and Application, New York, CRC Press, 13 1 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of using phages against unwanted bacteria developed shortly after their discovery. With the improvements in organic chemistry during the 1950s, exploration and development of broad spectrum antibiotics displaced interest in bacteriophage research. Several laboratories have been testing suitability of bacteriophage isolates to control certain bacterial pathogens. Significant advancements in this research have been made at the Bacteriophage Institute in Tbilisi, Georgia, where phage therapy is routinely applied in medicine research field. Today treatment of antibiotic resistant bacteria is a challenging task. Recently, research on bacteriophages has gained additional momentum in light of the identification of antibiotic-resistant pathogens of infectious diseases, wherein the application of antibiotics is not effectively working, therefore research on the application of bacteriophages is being reviewed intensely.&lt;ref name="Lacroix6"/&gt;
Bacteriophages have recently received a generally recognized as safe status based on their lack of toxicity and other detrimental effects to human health for application in meat products in USA.&lt;ref name="Pérez PulidoGrande Burgos2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pérez Pulido|first1=Rubén|last2=Grande Burgos|first2=Maria José|last3=Gálvez|first3=Antonio|last4=Lucas López|first4=Rosario|title=Application of bacteriophages in post-harvest control of human pathogenic and food spoiling bacteria|journal=Critical Reviews in Biotechnology|year=2015|pages=1–11|issn=0738-8551|doi=10.3109/07388551.2015.1049935|pmid=26042353 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phage preparations specific for ''L. monocytogenes,'' ''E. coli'' O157:H7,  and ''S. enterica'' serotypes have been commercialized and approved for application in foods or as part of surface decontamination protocols.&lt;ref name="Pérez PulidoGrande Burgos2015"/&gt;

==Meat biopreservation==

In meat processing, biopreservation has been extensively studied in fermented meat products and ready to eat meat products.&lt;ref name="Lacroix7"&gt;Lacroix, Christophe. (2011).

Online version available at: http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/pdf/id:kt00927AP3/protective-cultures-antimicrobial/applications-protective-4&lt;/ref&gt; The use of native or artificially-introduced microbial population to improve animal health and productivity, and/or to reduce pathogenic organisms, has been termed a probiotic or competitive enhancement approach.&lt;ref name="Fuller R"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fuller | first1 = R | year = 1989 | title = Probiotics in man and animals | url = | journal = J. Appl. Bacterial | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 365–378 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitive enhancement strategies that have been developed include competitive exclusion, addition of a microbial supplement (probiotic) that improves gastrointestinal health, and adding a limiting, non-host digestible nutrient (prebiotic) that provides an existing (or introduced) commensal microbial population a competitive advantage in the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref name="Lacroix8" /&gt; Each of these approaches utilizes the activities of the native microbial ecosystem against pathogens by capitalizing on the natural microbial competition. Generally speaking, competitive enhancement strategies offer a natural 'green' method to reduce pathogens in the gut of food animals.&lt;ref name="Lacroix8" /&gt;

==Seafood biopreservation==
Fishery products are a source of wide variety of valuable nutrients such as proteins, vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, taurine, etc.  Fishery products, however, are also associated with human intoxication and infection.  Approximately 10 to 20% of food-borne illnesses are attributed to fish consumption.&lt;ref name="Lacroix13"&gt;Lacroix, Christophe. (2011). Protective Cultures, Antimicrobial Metabolites and Bacteriophages for Food and Beverage Biopreservation - 13. Applications of Protective Cultures, Bacteriocins and Bacteriophages in Fresh Seafood and Seafood Products. Woodhead Publishing. Online version available at: [http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/pdf/id:kt00927B0C/protective-cultures-antimicrobial/applications-protective-2 http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/pdf/id:kt00927B0C/protective-cultures-antimicrobial/applications-protective-2]&lt;/ref&gt; Changing consumer demand has driven the appeal of traditional processes applied to seafood (e.g. salting, smoking and canning) lower compared to mild technologies involving lower salt content, lower cooking temperature and vacuum packing (VP)/modified atmosphere packing (MAP). These products, designed as lightly preserved fish products (LPFP), are usually produced from fresh seafood and further processing increases risk of cross contamination.&lt;ref name="Lacroix13" /&gt; These milder treatments are usually not sufficient to destroy microorganisms, and in some cases psychrotolerant pathogenic and spoilage bacteria can develop during the extended shelf-life of LPFP. Many of these products are also eaten raw, so minimizing the presence and preventing growth of microorganisms is essential for the food quality and safety.&lt;ref name="Lacroix13" /&gt; 
The microbial safety and stability of food are based on an application of preservative factors called hurdles.&lt;ref name="Rogers, S" /&gt;  The delicate texture and flavor of seafood are very sensitive to the decontamination technologies such as  cooking, and more recent mild technologies such as  pulsed light, high pressure, ozone, and ultrasound. Chemical preservatives, which are not processes but ingredients, are out of favor with consumers due to natural preservatives demand. An alternative solution that is gaining more and more attention is biopreservation technology.&lt;ref name="Rogers, S"&gt;RODGERS s (2001), 'Preserving non-fermented refrigerated foods with microbial cultures: a review', Trends in Food Science and Technology 12,276-284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Dortu C et al "&gt;DORTU c and THONART P (2009), 'Bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria: interest for food products biopreservation', Biotechnol Agron Soc Environ 13, 143-154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Calo-Mata P et al "&gt;CALO-MATA P, ARLINDO S, BOEHME K, DE MIGUEL T, PASCOAL A and BARROSVELAZQUEZ J (2008), 'Current applications and future trends of lactic acid bacteria and their bacteriocins for the biopreservation of aquatic food products', Food andBioprocess Technology 1,43-63.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[fish processing]], biopreservation is achieved by adding [[antimicrobial]]s or by increasing the [[acidity]] of the fish muscle. Most bacteria stop multiplying when the [[pH]] is less than 4.5.&lt;ref name="Lacroix13" /&gt; Traditionally, acidity has been increased by [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]], [[marination]] or by directly adding acetic, citric or lactic acid to food products. Other preservatives include [[nitrite]]s, [[sulphite]]s, [[sorbate]]s, [[benzoate]]s and [[essential oils]].&lt;ref name="FAO preservation"&gt;FAO: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/12322/en Preservation techniques] Fisheries and aquaculture department, Rome. Updated 27 May 2005. Retrieved 14 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for less documented studies for application of protective microorganisms, bacteriophages or bacteriocins on [[seafood products]] for biopreservation compared to dairy or meat products is probably that the early stages of biopreservation have occurred mainly in fermented foodstuffs that are not so developed among seafood products.&lt;ref name="Lacroix13" /&gt;  The selection of potential protective bacteria in seafood products is challenging due to the fact that they need adaptation to the seafood matrix (poor in sugar and their metabolic activities should not change the initial characteristics of the product, i.e. by acidification, and not induce spoilage that could lead to a sensory rejection.&lt;ref name="Lacroix13" /&gt; Among the microbiota identified in fresh or processed seafood, LAB remains the category that offers the highest potential for direct application as a bioprotective culture or for bacteriocin production.&lt;ref name="Lacroix13" /&gt;

==Commercial applications and products==

There has been successful implementation of various phage preparation around the globe. Various applications/delivery methods in food have been developed. Bacteriophages and their endolysins can be incorporated into food systems in several ways such as spraying, dipping or immobilization, singly or in combination with other hurdles.&lt;ref name="Hagens, S et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hagens | first1 = S | last2 = Loessner | first2 = MJ | year = 2010 | title = Bacteriophage for biocontrol of foodborne pathogens: calculations and considerations | url = | journal = Curr Pharm Biotechnol | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 58–68 | doi=10.2174/138920110790725429}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phage preparation LMP-1O2 has been subsequently commercialized as "ListShield"  [http://www.intralytix.com Intralyx, Inc].  It has been shown to be effective against 170 different strains of "''L. monocytogenes''", reducing significantly (10 to 1000-fold) the Listeria contamination when sprayed onto ready-to-eat foods, without changing the food general composition, taste, odor or color.&lt;ref name="Pérez PulidoGrande Burgos2015"/&gt;
The Intralytix company has also commercialized phage-based antimicrobial preparations like SalmoFresh and SalmoLyse  for controlling ''S. enterica''.&lt;ref name="Woolston, J et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woolston | first1 = J | last2 = Parks | first2 = AR | last3 = Abuladze | first3 = T | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = Bacteriophages lytic for Salmonella rapidly reduce Salmonella contamination on glass and stainless steel surfaces | url = | journal = Bacteriophage | volume = 3 | issue = | page = e25697 | doi=10.4161/bact.25697| pmc = 3821689}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SalmoFresh is prepared with a cocktail of naturally occurring lytic bacteriophages that selectively and specifically kill Salmonella, including strains belonging to the most common/highly pathogenic serotypes Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Heidelberg, Newport, Hadar, Kentucky and Thompson. According to the manufacturer, SalmoFresh is specifically designed for treating foods that are at high risk for "''Salmonella''" contamination. In particular, red meat and poultry can be treated prior to grinding for significant reductions in Salmonella contamination. SalmoLyse is a reformulated phage cocktail derived from SalmoFresh in which two of the six phages in the original cocktail have been replaced.&lt;ref name="Woolston, J et al" /&gt;  Additional bacteriophage preparations have been formulated and referenced to be used to reduce the microbial load of animals prior to slaughter and are commercially available from Omnilytics such as the BacWash product line against Salmonella [http://www.omnilytics.com/news/news019.html Omnilytics]. Another commercial application has been developed, Listex_ P100  by Micreos in The Netherlands and was granted generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status by the FDA and USDA for use in all food products.&lt;ref name="Hagens, S et al" /&gt;

Another significant commercial bacteriophage application is ELICOSALI, a wide range of anti-''Salmonella'' and "''E. coli''" phage cocktail, for treatment of agricultural products developed by Eliava Institute at Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia [https://web.archive.org/web/20160302070442/http://www.eliavaphageny.com/about.html Eliava Institute].&lt;ref name="Pérez PulidoGrande Burgos2015"/&gt;

==Safety==

Biopreservation judiciously exploits the antimicrobial potential of naturally occurring microorganisms in food and/or their metabolites with a long history of safe use. Bacteriocins, bacteriophages and bacteriophage-encoded enzymes fall in this theory. The long and traditional role of Lactic acid bacteria on food and feed fermentations is the main factor related to the use of bacteriocins in biopreservation. LAB and their bacteriocins have been consumed unintentionally for ages, laying down a long history of safe use. Their antimicrobial spectrum of inhibition, bactericidal mode of action, relative tolerance to processing conditions (pH, NaCl, heat treatments) and the lack of toxicity towards eukaryotic cells enforces their role as biopreservatives in food.&lt;ref name="Pilar Garcia et al" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = García | first1 = Pilar | last2 = Rodríguez | first2 = Lorena | last3 = Rodríguez | first3 = Ana | last4 = Martínez | first4 = Beatriz | year = 2010 | title = Food biopreservation: promising strategies using bacteriocins, bacteriophages and endolysins | url = | journal = Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology | volume = 21 | issue = 8| pages = 373–382 | doi = 10.1016/j.tifs.2010.04.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluation of any new antimicrobial actives is done in meat by USDA which relies on the GRAS assessment by FDA among other suitability data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">'''COCOA''' was an early [[text file]] utility and associated file format for [[digital humanities]], then known as humanities computing. It was approximately 4000 [[punched card]]s of [[FORTRAN]] and created in the late 1960s and early 1970s at [[University College London]] and the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] in [[Harwell, Oxfordshire]]. Functionality included word-counting and [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Paul E.

== Oxford Concordance Program ==

The Oxford Concordance Program (OCP) format was a direct descendent of COCOA developed at [[Oxford University]]. The [[Oxford Text Archive]] holds items in this format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Concordia discordantium canonum ac primum de iure naturae et constitutionis |publisher= University of Oxford Text Archive |accessdate= 20 October 2013 |url= http://ota.ox.ac.uk/desc/0699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later developments ==

The COCOA file format bears at least a passing similarity to the later [[markup language]]s such as [[SGML]] and [[XML]]. A noticeable difference with its successors is that COCOA tags are flat and not tree structured. In that format, every information type and value encoded by a tag should be considered true until the same tag changes its value. Members of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] community maintain legacy support for COCOA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= This script is used to convert COCOA to TEI |format= [[XSL]] |year= 2010 |author= James Cummings, [[Sebastian Rahtz]] |publisher= Oxford University |url= https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/blob/dev/cocoa/cocoa-to-tei.xsl |accessdate= 3 April 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/tree/master/cocoa&lt;/ref&gt; although most in-demand texts and corpora have already been migrated to more widely understand formats such as [[TEI XML]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helsinki.fi/varieng/CoRD/corpora/HelsinkiCorpus/HC_XML.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--
== Example ==
The play[[ The Medea of Euripides]] by [[Euripides]] in [[ancient greek]] is encoded in a 1976  [[Oxford Text Archive]] edition&lt;ref&gt;http://ota.ox.ac.uk/desc/2414&lt;/ref&gt; as:

&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

Note the [[XML]]-like tags at the start with metadata, numbered 'V' tags between each line and the creative use of whitespace on the first and last lines. The actually text is a pre-[[Unicode]] transliteration into the Roman alphabet, compare to the Greek source on [https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%9C%CE%AE%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B1 wikisource].

The '''CandyFab''' is a method of producing physical objects out of a computer representation of the structure. It differs from some other [[3D printing]] methods in the following aspects:

* It is optimized for relatively large pieces using low to medium print resolution.
* To reduce the hazards of working with large amounts of media, non-toxic materials (ideally, food-grade) are used. The prototype CandyFab 4000 unit uses granulated [[Sucrose|sugar]] as its print medium, giving rise to its name, but other materials with low melting temperatures and low toxicities are still under consideration.
* It uses low cost parts and construction to make it easier for others to design or build their own, with plans available as [[open source]].

The CandyFab uses a heat source mounted on a computer-controlled X-Y positioning head to fuse the surface of a granular bed of the print media. The only thing which comes into contact with the media is heated air, which is turned on and off by the software synchronously with the motion of the positioning head. Fabrication of the shape of the part being produced progresses in layers; after each complete pass, the bed is lowered and a fresh layer of granular media is applied on top. The unfused media serves to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, reducing the need for auxiliary temporary supports for the workpiece. The movable bed is of a size suitable for producing finished parts several kilograms in weight.

The resolution of features produced correspond to a smallest volume element of 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.7 mm or less.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/candyfab Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories - Solid freeform fabrication: DIY, on the cheap, and made of pure sugar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces produced from ordinary granular sugar have fairly good strength and feature an amber to brown surface color owing to [[caramelization]] of the sugar. Special attention has been paid to the selection of all materials coming into contact with the sugar bed or with the hot air stream to make it possible to fabricate food-grade pieces if desired.

There is an effort to encourage further work on improving the technology in the following areas:

*Hardware 
*[[3D modeling]] software
*[[CNC]] software

In addition, the inventors Windell Oskay and Lenore Edman of candyfab.org have organized teams to explore applications, gastronomy, and post processing.

==Fabricated pieces==

Several large pieces of sculpture have been produced using the CandyFab, including one of a mathematical object designed by sculptor [[Bathsheba Grossman]]. This and other pieces were shown by inventors Windell Oskay and Lenore Edman of candyfab.org at the Bay Area Maker Faire 2007. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://makerfaire.com/pub/e/141# |title=makerfaire.com:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928063921/http://makerfaire.com/pub/e/141# |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Charles William Siemens''' [[FRSA]] (originally '''Carl Wilhelm Siemens'''; 4 April 1823 – 19 November 1883) was a German-born engineer and entrepreneur who for most of his life worked in Britain and later became a British subject.

==Biography==
Siemens was born in the village of Lenthe, today part of [[Gehrden]], near [[Hanover]] where his father, Christian Ferdinand Siemens (31 July 1787 – 16 January 1840), a tenant farmer, farmed an estate belonging to the Crown. The [[Siemens family]] is an old family of [[Goslar]] which has been documented since 1384. His mother was Eleonore Deichmann (1792–8 July 1839), and William, or Carl Wilhelm, was the fourth son of a family of fourteen children.  Of his siblings, [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Ernst Werner Siemens]], the fourth child, became a famous electrician and was associated with William in many of his inventions. He was also the brother of [[Carl Heinrich von Siemens]] and a cousin of [[Alexander Siemens]].

On 23 July 1859, Siemens was married at St James's, [[Paddington]], to Anne Gordon, the youngest daughter of Mr Joseph Gordon, [[Writers to the Signet|Writer to the Signet]], Edinburgh, and brother to [[Lewis Gordon (civil engineer)|Mr Lewis Gordon]], Professor of Engineering in the [[University of Glasgow]] and became a naturalised British subject. He used to say that on 19 March of that year he took oath and allegiance to two ladies in one day – to [[Queen Victoria|The Queen]] and to his betrothed.  He was [[knight]]ed – becoming Sir William – a few months before his death. He died on the evening of Monday 19 November 1883, at nine o'clock and was buried on Monday 26 November, in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London.&lt;ref name=Paths&gt;{{cite book|title=Paths of Glory|date=1997|publisher=Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery|page=89|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A glass window installed in [[Westminster Abbey]] in his honour commemorated him.

==The early years==
In the autumn of 1838 when William was fifteen years old, he began his studies to become an engineer. He attended a highly respected School of Trade and Commerce, the ''Gewerbe-Schule Magdeburg''. William had a particularly close relationship with his eldest brother; [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Ernst Werner Siemens]] had decided to teach William mathematics so that he could learn English at school instead. This programme helped them both and William's knowledge of English proved an incalculable advantage to them both. He went on to pass his examination easily. Less than a year later, their mother died and their father soon afterwards in 1840.

Once William had completed his course at the [[Magdeburg]] school he went on to the [[University of Göttingen]] where he attended lectures on physical geography and technology, high mathematics, theoretical chemistry and practical chemistry and physics. He was also able for a short time to work with [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]], the renowned scientist and inventor, in his Magnetic Observatory.

William was nearly nineteen when he left university to become an apprentice engineer. He also found time for more artistic pursuits such as taking dancing lessons and even painting a landscape of [[Nordhausen]] for the wife of the factory manager. His progress in the engineering factory was so rapid that his two-year apprenticeship was cut down to one.

Due to the education of the younger members of the family becoming a financial worry, on 10 March 1843, Carl Wilhelm Siemens left for London. He was acting as an agent for his brother Werner, and he hoped to earn enough money by selling a patent in England to help support and educate his many brothers and sisters. He felt a keen desire to see England and the journey cost him £1. William had already shown himself to be an enthusiastic businessman, having financed his trip by selling an invention of his brother's, an improvement to the gold and silver plating process, to [[George Richards Elkington]]. He was well aware, as he wrote to Werner, that his visit might achieve nothing, but if all went well he intended to remain. This indeed proved to be the case.

==Career==
Siemens had been trained as a mechanical engineer, and his most important work at this early stage was non-electrical; the greatest achievement of his life, the [[Open hearth furnace|regenerative furnace]]. Though in 1847 he published a paper in Liebig's ''Annalen der Chemie'' on the 'Mercaptan of Selenium,' his mind was busy with the new ideas upon the nature of heat which were promulgated by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]], [[Émile Clapeyron|Clapeyron]], [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]], [[Clausius]], [[Julius Robert von Mayer|Mayer]], [[Lord Kelvin|Thomson]], and [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]]. He discarded the older notions of heat as a substance, and accepted it as a form of energy.  Working on this new line of thought, which gave him an advantage over other inventors of his time, he made his first attempt to economise heat, by constructing, in 1847, at the factory of [[John Hick (MP)|John Hick]], of Bolton, an engine of four horse-power, having a condenser provided with regenerators, and using [[superheater|superheated]] steam. Two years later he continued his experiments at the works of [[Fox, Henderson &amp; Co|Messrs. Fox, Henderson, and Co.]], of [[Smethwick]], near [[Birmingham]], who had taken the matter in hand.  The use of superheated steam was attended with many practical difficulties, and the invention was not entirely successful; nevertheless, the Society of Arts, in 1850, acknowledged the value of the principle, by awarding Siemens a gold medal for his regenerative condenser.

In 1850 he established the London sales office of [[Siemens &amp; Halske]], the engineering company producing [[telegraph]]s, which his brother Werner had founded in 1847 at Berlin. He started selling such devices to the wire rope producer ''R. S. Newall &amp; Co'' in [[Dundee]], of which his friend (and uncle of his later wife) [[Lewis Gordon (civil engineer)|Lewis Gordon]] was the co-owner. Newall &amp; Co also outsourced test jobs for cables to Siemens and such enabled the new company to enter the ocean cable-laying business. The branch office became [[Siemens Brothers]] in 1858. In the 1850s, the company was involved in building long distance telegraph networks in Russia. In 1855, a company branch headed by another brother, [[Carl Heinrich von Siemens]], opened in [[St Petersburg]], Russia. By 1863, Sir William had his own cable factory built at [[Charlton, London|Charlton]], London. In 1867, Siemens completed the monumental Indo-European ([[Kolkata|Calcutta]] to London) telegraph line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://w4.siemens.de/archiv/en/laender/asien/indien.html | title=Siemens history | accessdate=12 January 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120233553/http://w4.siemens.de/archiv/en/laender/asien/indien.html | archivedate=20 January 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859 William Siemens devoted a great part of his time to electrical invention and research; and the number of telegraph apparatus of all sorts – telegraph cables, land lines, and their accessories – which have emanated from the [[Siemens Brothers|Siemens Telegraph Works]] (at [[Charlton, London|Charlton]], SE London) has been remarkable. In 1872 Sir William Siemens became the first President of the Society of Telegraph Engineers which became the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]], the forerunner of the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] [http://www.theiet.org/]

[[File:SiemensEngine1860.jpg|right|640px|thumb|The 4-cylinder experimental gas engine subject of Siemens patent (image taken from Theory of the Gas Engine by Dugald Clerk in 1882)]]
In 1860 William Siemens constructed a remarkable gas engine (the same year the very first commercial engine was produced by [[Étienne Lenoir|Lenoir]]). It didn't get beyond the experimental stage, though its principle of operation (described in Siemens British patent 2074 of 1860, and by Siemens in ''The Theory of the Gas Engine''&lt;ref&gt;[[Dugald Clerk]]. The Theory of the Gas Engine, D. Van Nostrand, New York, 1882&lt;/ref&gt;) appears to be similar to the commercially successful [[George Brayton|Brayton]] engine of 1872. In the discussion section of ''The Theory of the Gas Engine'' Siemens discloses that :&lt;br /&gt;
"The engine promised to give very good results, but about the same time he began to give his attention to the production of intense heat in furnaces, and having to make his choice between the two subjects, he selected the furnace and the metallurgic process leading out of it ; and that was why the engine had remained where it was for so long a time."

Siemens was also responsible for the hot tube ignition system used on many of the early gas engines.&lt;ref&gt;Dugald Clerk, "Gas and Oil Engines", Longman Green &amp; Co, (7th Edition) 1897, p224&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1862 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27siemens%27%29 |title=Library and Archive Catalogue |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=15 October 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1871 delivered their [[Bakerian Lecture]].

The [[Siemens regenerative furnace|regenerative furnace]] is the greatest single invention of Charles William Siemens, using a process known as the [[Siemens-Martin process]]. The electric [[pyrometer]], which is perhaps the most elegant and original of all William Siemens's inventions, is also the link which connects his electrical with his metallurgical researches. Siemens pursued two major themes in his inventive efforts, one based upon the science of heat, the other based upon the science of electricity; and the electric thermometer was, as it were, a delicate cross-coupling which connected both. 

[[File:CS Faraday.jpg|thumb|[[CS Faraday (1874)|CS Faraday]]]]
In 1874 he had a special [[cable ship]] built, according to his design, for ''Siemens Brothers'', the [[CS Faraday (1874)|CS ''Faraday'']]. In 1881, a Siemens [[Alternating current|AC]] [[Alternator]] driven by a [[watermill]] was used to power the world's first electric street lighting in the town of [[Godalming]], United Kingdom.

[[Image:CasingCutter002.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|DSI Casing Cutter details]]

A '''Casing-Cutter''' is a device used in petroleum industry to cut a complete section of a casing, a liner or all others tubular components in a [[well bore]].
This cutting tool is composed by several cutting  blades (reinforced with [[Tungsten carbide]]) pivotally mounted on support body.
During cutting operations, the cutting blades are gradually deployed outside the support body by hydraulic pressure or mechanical action

'''Castellane''' ({{IPA-fr|kastɛlan}}; [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]]: ''Castelana'') is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]] [[Departments of France|department]] in southeastern [[France]]. With about 1,600 inhabitants, Castellane has the distinction of being the least-populated sub-prefecture of France.

Its inhabitants are referred to as ''Castellanais''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Brunet, [http://tresordesregions.mgm.fr Canton of Castellane], ''Le Trésor des régions''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Castellane is a very old city located upstream of the [[Verdon Gorge|Gorges du Verdon]]. The city is {{convert|724|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michel de La Torre |title= Alpes-de-Haute-Provence : le guide complet des 200 communes|location=Paris |publisher= Deslogis-Lacoste |work= Villes et villages de France |year=1989 |isbn=2-7399-5004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roc, or the Roc of Notre-Dame, overlooks the city from {{cvt|184|m|ft|0}} above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Dichary|title=Castellane: à l'aube des gorges du Verdon|publisher=Serre Éditeur |location=Nice |year=1994 |language=French |trans-title=Castellane: At the Dawn of the Gorges of Verdon|isbn=978-2-86410-206-9 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been occupied since the [[High Middle Ages]] and is a registered historical site. It can be accessed from the centre of town behind the old Church of St. Andrew. The walk takes about 25 minutes.

Two reservoirs are located in the territory of Castellane:
* [[Lac de Castillon|Lake Castillon]]
* Lake Chaudanne, created by the dam of the same name, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Barrage de Chaudanne|fr}}.
The area has two [[water gap]]s: 
* the ''clue de Taulanne'' containing the [[Asse (river)|Asse de Blieux]] river and the [[Route Napoléon]] along its banks.
* the ''clue de Chasteuil'', which contains the [[Verdon River|Verdon]] valley.

[[File:Castellane_-_Petra_Castellana_-2.jpg|thumb|left|Petra Castellana]]
Castellane's name appeared in texts for the first time circa 965-977 as ''Petra Castellana''. The name breaks down into three [[Occitan]] terms, ''pèira'', ''castel'' and the suffix ''-ana,'' which means fortified rock and village, and could be translated as "Castellane rock", in other words, the rock that has a fortified village,&lt;ref name=EN&gt;

The village of ''Robion'' has the same name as the river that and flows through it  into the {{Interlanguage link multi|Jabron River|fr|3=Jabron_(affluent_du_Verdon)}} and takes its source from the Massif du Robion to the east of the village.

It derived its name from the Occitan ''[[:fr:wikt:talador#Occitan|talador]]'', meaning soldiers especially recruited to devastate the land of an adversary. Adding the -ia suffix designates, either a land inhabited by these devastators, or a land devastated by the ''taladors''.

The region was conquered by [[Augustus]] in 14 BC. Castellane was attached to the Roman province of [[Alpes-Maritimes]] and began to grow.

Residents first settled on the bank of the Verdon to mine the saline sources which are still visible today. A treasure of antiquity, 34 gold coins issued by [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], were discovered in 1797 in Taloire. A limestone funerary stele for one Julius Trofimus, dating back to Roman times, was discovered near the old chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Plan.

A diocese was founded in the fifth century: its seat was transferred to Senez before the 6th century however and despite all attempts to have it return to Castellan it remained there until it was closed in the French Revolution.

In the early ninth century, the area around the current town of Castellane was inhabited by only 84 people.In 812 the area was invaded by Moors, also sometimes called Saracens; they destroyed ''Salines'', the early settlement near the salt marshes.&lt;ref name=gros&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7flPwL6Da9sC |title=Antiquités de l'arrondissement de Castellanne |edition=2 |via=University of Oxford, Google Books |year=1842 |author= Gras-Bourguet |publisher= Digne |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants of Salines took refuge on the summit of the Roc and built a stronghold there, building the first Notre-Dame there, inaugurated in 852, in thanks for the refuge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basecommunale.paca.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/pdf/fiches/sites_classes/93C04004.pdf |title=CASTELLANE: LE ROC NOTRE-DAME |author=DIREN PACA |work=catalogue départemental des sites classés, Alpes de Haute-Provence|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some vestiges of this site, which was named ''Sinaca'' in 813 and ''Petra Castellana'' in 965, are still visible at the place now known as ''Le Signal''.

In 1189, Baron de Castellane Boniface III was attacked by [[Alfonso II of Aragon|Alfonso I of Provence]]. He had refused to do homage, explaining that he was a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1262, [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I of Anjou]] defeated [[Bonifaci VI de Castellana|Boniface of Castellane]] and made Castelle the seat of a [[:fr:wikt:baile#Ancien occitan|baile]]. In the thirteenth century, the family of Castellane lost possession of the city to the Counts of Provence. To protect themselves from attack, in addition to the protections for the city, Castellane built a series of fortified outposts at [[Demandolx]], [[La Garde, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence|La Garde]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Chasteuil|fr}}, [[Rougon]], and perhaps Taloire.{{when|date=September 2016}} In 1300 a small Jewish community of eight households was established in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Édouard Baratier|title=La démographie provençale du XIIIe au XVIe siècles, avec chiffres de comparaison pour le XVIIIe siècle|location=Paris|publisher=SEVPEN/EHESS|year=1961|work=Collection Démographie et société|number=5| page=70|language=French|trans-title=Provençal Demography in from the 13th to the 16th century, with numbers compared to the 18th century}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]] reached Castellane in 1348, and was followed by a devastating flood of the [[Verdon River]]. The capture and death of Queen [[Joanna I of Naples]] created a succession issue in the county of Provence, the cities of the [[Union of Aix]] (1382-1387) supporting [[Charles III of Naples|Charles de Duras]] against [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou|Louis I of Anjou]].&lt;ref&gt;

The bridge toll for the Verdon and the fair began at the end of the Middle Ages. The fair continued until the end of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', assuring the town relative prosperity.

In the fifteenth century, a community settled on the present site of Taloire. In the middle of the fifteenth century, the upper village was completely abandoned in favor of the lowland site.

&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish left their quarters by night and advanced on Castellane through the ''clue de Taulanne'', while the French passing through the Vodon gorge. The difficult marches necessary to approach in this way nonetheless allowed a coordinated attack around 7am.

The first outposts were taken without difficulty, which allowed Maulévrier to connect on his left with Taubin, and to send a column of [[dragoons]] onto the right bank to cut the Austrians' retreat. This assault took the Austrian-Sardinians fortifications without difficulty, the French-Spanish entered the town and did prevent the last Austrians from retreating. In all, they took 287 Austrians prisoner, including the baron de Neuhaus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=173|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DTZbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA173|title=Lettres historiques: contenant ce qui se passe de plus important en Europe et les réflexions nécessaires sur ce sujet..., Volume 122|author1=Jacques Bernard|author2=Henri Basnage (sieur de Beauval)|author3=Jean du Mont |editor=Adrian Moetjens|year=1747|language=French|via=Google Books, Université de Gand}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lieutenant-general in command. The Austrian-Sardinians also had a hundred-odd dead, versus twenty Franco-Spanish soldiers. The villages of La Garde, Eoulx, Robion, Taloire, Trigance and Comps were evacuated on January 22.

In 1760, a tax imposed by the king of Piedmont-Sardinia on sales of cloth brought a large reduction in the town's textile production. Production of {{Interlanguage link multi|cadis|fr}}, a local form of wool, and of ''cordeillat'', a coarse woolen fabric, continued until the Revolution, and was used by the local residents.

Until the Revolution salt was produced from two local salt marshes.

On the eve of the [[French Revolution]], several [[fiefs]] existed on the actual territory of the commune: Éoulx, Le Castellet-de-Robion (which became a [[feudal barony|barony]] in 1755), Chasteuil, Taulanne and Castillon, plus Castellane. On the same territory there were nine [[parish]]es: Castillon, La Baume, Taulanne, La Palud, Chasteuil, Taloire, Villars-Brandis, Robion, et Castellane. The parish of Éoulx overlapped the community of La Garde.

The city of Castellane alone paid more tax than [[Digne]]; it was an important rural town, both for its judiciary functions (with eight lawyers and five prosecutors) and for its production, with twelve factories: among which were six hat shops, two wax factories, one faïence works, one tile factory, one silk fabrication works, and the leather industry was also represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Préfecture des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence|title=Histoire de la Sous-Préfecture de Castellane|publisher=Préfecture des Alpes de Haute-Provence}}&lt;/ref&gt; A royal post office was also installed in Castellane near the end of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Émile Lauga|title=La poste dans les Basses-Alpes, ou l'histoire du courrier de l'Antiquité à l'aube du XXe siècle|language=French|trans-title=Postal Service in the Basses-Alpes, or the History of Mail from Antiquity to the Dawn of the 20th Century|location=Digne-les-Bains|publisher=Éditions de Haute-Provence|year=1994|isbn=2-909800-64-4| page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloth industry, already well established in the preceding century, prospered in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond Collier|title=La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique|location=Digne|publisher=Imprimerie Louis Jean|year=1986|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt; But cottage industries were replaced by the Barneaud factory, built in the late 1830s on the model of the Honnorat factory in [[Saint-André-les-Alpes|Saint-André-de-Méouilles]]. It employed nine workers in 1872, then disappeared in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Mireille Mistral

The Revolution and the Empire brought social reforms, including proportional taxation based on the assets. In order to put this in place on a precise basis, a land registry was drawn up. The ''loi de finances du 15 septembre 1807'' specified its methods, but its accomplishment took time to get started, since the officials conducting the ''[[cadastre]]'' dealt with the ''communes'' in successive geographic groups. Not until 1834-1835 was the land registry known as the Napoleonic cadastre of Castellane and its associated communes finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alexeï Laurent|title=Paysages ruraux de la première moitié du XIXe siècle dans le sud-est des Basses-Alpes|editor=Jean-Christophe Labadie|series=''La matière et le bâti en Haute-Provence, XVIIIe-XXIe siècle'', proceedings of the first History of Haute-Provence Day (Journée d'études d'histoire de la Haute-Provence), Digne, 13 October 2012|work=Digne-les-Bains: Archives départementales des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence|year=2013|isbn=978-2-86004-016-7| page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[coup d'état]] of 2 December 1851 committed by Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte against the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] provoked an armed uprising in the [[Basses-Alpes]] in defense of the Constitution. Insurgent republicans took a number of cities in the center and south of France, including [[Digne]], the prefecture of the [[Basses-Alpes]], and held them for several days. The local fighters held out the longest, almost three weeks. But this allowed Bonaparte to portray himself as the protector of France, and many participants were sent to penal colonies in [[Lambesa]] and [[Cayenne]], banished or less permanently exiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-parlements1-2009-2-page-24.htm#no34|title=Le coup d’État du 2 décembre 1851 ou la chronique de deux morts annoncées et l’avènement d’un grand principe|author=Eric Anceau|work=Parlement[s], Revue d'histoire politique |year=2009 |volume=12 |publisher=L'Harmattan|issn=1760-6233 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight inhabitants of Castellane were brought before the ''commission mixte''; their most common penalty was deportation to Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henri Joannet|author2=Jean-Pierre Pinatel|title=Arrestations-condamnations 1851|trans-title=Arrests-Convictions 1851|work=Pour mémoire, Les Mées: Les Amis des Mées|year=2001|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==

On 10 September 1926, the sous-préfecture was eliminated in the economic plan of [[Raymond Poincaré]], then re-established by the [[Vichy government]] in June 1942.

An [[internment]] camp was built in Chaudanne during [[World War II]]. Seventeen Jews were arrested in Castellane and deported. On 9 December 1943, the French [[armée secrète]] (AS) and the [[Francs-tireurs et partisans]] (FTP) attacked the construction site at the Castillon dam and seized five tonnes of explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jean Garcin|title=La résistance armée|work=Basses-Alpes|volume=39-45|issue=7|date=July 2004| page=4|language=French|trans-title=Armed Resistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''commune'' was liberated 18 August 1944 by the [[36th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|36th division]] of British infantry.

In the mid-20th century [[viticulture|wine growing]] for local consumption ended.

==Sites and monuments==
[[File:Castellane_-176.jpg|thumb|right|The Roc and the bridge of the Roc]]
The Rock which dominates the city, rising to {{convert|930|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} (over {{convert|200|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} above the Verdon), is a listed historical  site.

The oldest monument in the territory of the commune is the [[dolmen]] of Pierres Blanches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=PA00132925|title=Architecture|date=April 16, 1996|publisher=ministère de la culture française}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neolithic-Chalcolithic,  a registered historical site on private property. The Roc towers {{convert|184|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} above the community of Castellane.

The Musée des sirènes et fossiles and the Moyen Verdon is networked with other museums in the Gorges du Verdon, including the home of Pauline Gréoux-les-Bains, the museum of the life of yesteryear Esparron-de-Verdon, home gorges du Verdon in La Palud-sur-Verdon and the Museum of prehistory in Quinson gorges du Verdon.

==Architecture==
[[File:Antibes Castellane.JPG|thumb|right|In the city of Castellane]]

The bridge of the Roc, which carries the [[Sisteron]]-[[Vence]] road across the river, was built in the first decade of the fifteenth century, replacing a succession of several wooden bridges, the last spanning the Verdon in 1300 and destroyed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Raimond de Turenne|fr}} in 1390. The construction of the new bridge parallels that of [[Nyons]] (built in 1401, {{convert|42|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long), Pont de Claix (built in 1607-13, {{convert|45|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long), [[Tournon-sur-Rhône|Tournon]] (built in the sixteenth century, {{convert|49|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long) and [[Entrechaux]] ({{convert|24.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} long). [[Pope Benedict XIII]] granted [[indulgence]]s to anyone who gave [[alms]] to finance its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Serge Montens|title=Les plus beaux ponts de France|location=Paris |publisher=Bonneton |year=2001 |isbn=2-86253-275-4 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rearguard]] of the Austrian-Sardinian army was caught there by a [[sortie]] from the [[garrison]].
[[File:France_PACA_04_Castellane_06.jpg|thumb|left|Bridge of the Roc]]
The [[tympanum (architecture)|tympana]] of the Roc bridge have been restored several times. Metal [[tie rod]]s were laid in 1697-99. The bridge as a whole was restored in 2008 and closed to traffic. It was decommissioned in 1967 and delisted in 1982. The bridge and its approaches have been a registered historical site since 1940.

The library is in the former convent of the [[Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary|Visitation]], founded in 1644. The eighteenth-century castle at Éoulx is richly decorated with plasterwork, including the first floor ceilings, the panels surrounding the doors, the rosette in the second-floor ceilings. Externally, it has two towers, with arched openings. The town hall is housed in the building that used to be the savings bank. It resembles a villa: balconies supported by large [[corbel]]s and thick [[baluster]]s, and a façade adorned with a [[pediment]].

Catellane's largest fountain, in the main square, features a pyramid on which is carved a compass crossed by a [[carpenter's square]], two [[chisel]]s and a [[mallet]], emblems of the [[Freemasons]]. At the top of the pyramid is a [[pedestal]] with a ball. On National Street, two doors have [[transom (architectural)|transom]]s or capitals with [[volute]]s, and one [[lintel]] is decorated with carved foliage. In the town, several buildingss, mostly dry stone, have been recorded in the inventory of topographic DRAC. One of them, in Rayaup, dates from the eighteenth century (the inscription that says 1586 is very recent).

==Notre-Dame du Roc==
[[File:Castellane_7_chapelleNDduRoc.jpg|thumb|left|Notre Dame du Roc]]
The Chapel of Our Lady of the Rock, dating from the High Middle Ages, dominates the city from atop the Rock and belongs to the former Convent of Mercy. But only the wall and the south façade date from the twelfth century; the building was half demolished during the [[French wars of religion|wars of religion]] and rebuilt in 1590.

Crumbling by 1703, the chapel was again rebuilt in the early eighteenth century and once more in 1860. A capital adorned with foliage and scrolls dates from the Renaissance.
[[File:Castellane_7_chapelleNDduRoc2.jpg|thumb|right]]
The furnishings include:
*a statue of the Virgin, in marble, possibly 16th century 
*two paintings, ''St. Charles Borromeo'' and ''St. Francis and St. Jeanne de Chantal'', on the historic register for both the paintings and their gilded frames, bearing the arms of the Bishop of Senez Duchaîne and dating from the seventeenth century.

It received numerous [[votive offering]]s in the 19th and 20th centuries, including:
[[File:Castellane_7_chapelleNDduRoc3.jpg|thumb|left|Votive offerings]]
*traditional engraved plates (136 total);
*bridal bouquets (21 total);
*a painting given after a vow to Our Lady, dating from 1757, and registered;
*a painting given after the cholera epidemic in 1835, registered;
*a painting given by a released prisoner, dated 1875 (registered);
*a painting given in thanks after a smallpox epidemic, dated 1870, registered;
*a painting given by a person who escaped a shipwreck in 1896, registered.

==Saint-Victor==
[[File:Église_Saint-Victor_-_Castellane.jpg|thumb|right|Saint Victor]]
Parts of the old parish church of Saint-Victor date from the mid-11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=PA00080359|title=Architecture: Eglise Saint-Victor|work=Mérimée database|publisher=ministère de culture française|language=French|date=June 4, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is listed as an historical building. It was constructed in a similar manner and on the same plane as the Church of St. Andrew in the old village above the modern-day town, and was formerly the seat of a [[priory]] of the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Marseille|Abbey of St. Victor]] in Marseille.

The [[apse]] is decorated with [[Lombard band]]s, which have been described as remarkable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/ccmed_0007-9731_1977_num_20_77_2053|title=Survivances du premier art roman en Provence &amp;#124; Surviving Traces of Early Roman Art in Provence|author=Victor Lassalle|work=Cahiers de civilisation médiévale|year=1977 |volume=20 |issue=77 |page=6|via=Persée|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; each arch carved from a single stone. Unusually for the region, it has a Roman [[nave]], with arches rebuilt in the 17th century. The base of the tower dates from 1445, but its top was rebuilt in the 18th century following damage by Protestants in 1560.

The altar dates from 1724. The choir is adorned with paintings framed in wood, and an [[Annunciation]] carved in [[relief#high relief|relief]] from gilded wood (18th century, on historical register). The wooden furniture, the stalls, the pulpit and the lectern with its hexagonal base, form an interesting 18th and 19th-century set, some of which is on the historic register. The furnishings also include an early 17th-century silver chalice with an unusual multilobed foot, also on the historic register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/palissy_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=PM04000641|title=Mobilier: calice|date=July 20, 2000|work=Palissy database|publisher=ministère de la culture française|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tour_de_l'Horloge_-_castellane.jpg|thumb|left|Tour de l'Horloge]]
Construction on the wall enclosing the lower town began in 1359, with the permission of the [[Count of Provence]], [[Louis I of Naples]]. Traces of this wall are still visible in the square towers on the front of the houses on the square. [[Corbel]]s, which could support defenses ([[brattice]]s or simple [[parapet]]s with [[battlement]]s) are visible on their façades.

Two of the original gates in the wall remain:
*the gate of the Annunciation or of the ''pétardiers'', flanked by two towers, high ground in the resistance of 1586;
* the gate of the clock, also called St. Augustine's gate, set in a square tower. A passage crosses under the tower through an arch. The tower is listed on the register of historic places.

One of the towers in the Saint-Michel neighborhood has been home to a [[dovecote]] since 1585.

A '''colocation centre''' (also spelled '''co-location''', or '''colo''') or "'''carrier hotel'''", is a type of [[data center|data centre]] where equipment, space, and bandwidth are available for rental to retail customers.  Colocation facilities provide space, power, cooling, and physical security for the server, storage, and networking equipment of other firms—and connect them to a variety of telecommunications and network service providers—with a minimum of cost and complexity.

Many colocation providers sell to a wide range of customers, ranging from large enterprises to small companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pashke|first1=Jeff|title=Going Open – Software vendors in transition|url=https://451research.com/report-long?icid=315|publisher=451 Research|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the customer owns the IT equipment and the facility provides power and cooling. Customers retain control over the design and usage of their equipment, but daily management of the data center and facility are overseen by the multi-tenant colocation provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colocation: Managed or unmanaged?|url=https://www.7l.com/blog/colocation-managed-or-unmanaged/|publisher=7L Networks|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Cabinets – A cabinet is a locking unit that holds a server rack. In a multi-tenant data center, servers within cabinets share raised-floor space with other tenants, in addition to sharing power and cooling infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colocation Benefits And How To Get Started|url=https://www.psychz.net/client/kb/en/learn-about-colocation-benefits-and-how-to-get-started.html|publisher=Psychz Networks|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cages – A cage is dedicated server space within a traditional raised-floor data center; it is surrounded by mesh walls and entered through a locking door. Cages share power and cooling infrastructure with other data center tenants.
* Suites – A suite is a dedicated, private server space within a traditional raised-floor data center; it is fully enclosed by solid partitions and entered through a locking door. Suites may share power and cooling infrastructure with other data center tenants, or have these resources provided on a dedicated basis.
* Modules – [[Modular data center|data center modules]] are purpose-engineered modules and components to offer scalable data center capacity. They typically use standardized components, which make them easily added, integrated or retrofitted into existing data centers, and cheaper and easier to build.&lt;ref&gt;DCD Intelligence [http://www.io.com/solutions/resource/assessing-cost-modular-versus-traditional-build/ “Assessing the Cost: Modular versus Traditional Build”], October 2013 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007014729/http://www.io.com/solutions/resource/assessing-cost-modular-versus-traditional-build/ |date=7 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a colocation environment, the data center module is a data center within a data center, with its own steel walls and security protocol, and its own cooling and power infrastructure. "A number of colocation companies have praised the modular approach to data centers to better match customer demand with physical build outs, and allow customers to buy a data center as a service, paying only for what they consume."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Rath|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/10/26/dck-guide-to-modular-data-centers-the-modular-market/|title=DCK Guide To Modular Data Centers: The Modular Market|website=Data Center Knowledge|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building features==
Buildings with data centres inside them are often easy to recognize due to the amount of cooling equipment located outside or on the roof.&lt;ref&gt;Examples can be seen at http://www.datacentermap.com/blog/data-centers-from-the-sky-174.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rack001.jpg|thumb|upright|A typical server rack, commonly seen in colocation]]

Colocation facilities have many other special characteristics:
* [[Fire protection]] systems, including [[passive fire protection|passive]] and active elements, as well as implementation of [[fire prevention]] programmes in operations. [[Smoke detector]]s are usually installed to provide early warning of a developing fire by detecting particles generated by smouldering components prior to the development of flame. This allows investigation, interruption of power, and manual fire suppression using hand held fire extinguishers before the fire grows to a large size. A [[fire sprinkler system]] is often provided to control a full scale fire if it develops. [[Clean agent]] fire suppression gaseous systems are sometimes installed to suppress a fire earlier than the fire sprinkler system. Passive fire protection elements include the installation of [[Firewall (construction)|fire walls]] around the space, so a fire can be restricted to a portion of the facility for a limited time in the event of the failure of the active fire protection systems, or if they are not installed.
* [[19-inch rack]]s for data equipment and servers, 23-inch racks for telecommunications equipment
* Cabinets and cages for physical access control over tenants' equipment. Depending on one's needs a cabinet can house individual or multiple racks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Much Space Will I Need In A Colocation Center? |url=https://www.atisolutions.com/faqs/space-and-server-storage-options-in-colocation-centers.cfm |website=ATI Solutions Inc. |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overhead or underfloor cable rack (tray) and fibreguide, power cables usually on separate rack from data
* [[Air conditioning]] is used to control the temperature and humidity in the space. [[ASHRAE]] recommends a temperature range and humidity range for optimal electronic equipment conditions versus environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/products/1840202|title=Thermal Guidelines for Data Processing Environments, 3rd Ed. - ASHRAE Store|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrical power used by the electronic equipment is converted to heat, which is rejected to the ambient air in the data centre space. Unless the heat is removed, the ambient temperature will rise, resulting in electronic equipment malfunction. By controlling the space air temperature, the server components at the board level are kept within the manufacturer's specified temperature and humidity range. Air conditioning systems help keep equipment space [[humidity]] within acceptable parameters by cooling the return space air below the [[dew point]]. Too much humidity and water may begin to [[condensation|condense]] on internal components. In case of a dry atmosphere, ancillary humidification systems may add water vapour to the space if the humidity is too low, to avoid [[electrostatics|static electricity]] discharge problems which may damage components.
* Low-impedance electrical [[Ground (electricity)|ground]]
* Few, if any, windows

Colocation data centres are often audited to prove that they live up to certain standards and levels of reliability; the most commonly seen systems are [[SSAE 16]] SOC 1 Type I and Type II (formerly [[SAS 70]] Type I and Type II) and the tier system by the Uptime Institute or TIA. For service organizations today, SSAE 16 calls for a description of its "system". This is far more detailed and comprehensive than SAS 70's description of "controls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colocationamerica.com/data-center-certifications/ssae16-compliance.htm|title=Colocation America|publisher=SSAE 16 Compliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other data center compliance standards include Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) audit and PCI DSS Standards.

==Power==
Colocation facilities generally have [[Electrical generator|generators]] that start automatically when utility power fails, usually running on [[diesel fuel]]. These generators may have varying levels of redundancy, depending on how the facility is built. Generators do not start instantaneously, so colocation facilities usually have battery backup systems. In many facilities, the operator of the facility provides large inverters to provide AC power from the batteries. In other cases, customers may install smaller [[Uninterruptible power supply|UPSes]] in their racks.

Some customers choose to use equipment that is powered directly by 48&amp;nbsp;VDC (nominal) battery banks. This may provide better energy efficiency, and may reduce the number of parts that can fail, though the reduced voltage greatly increases necessary current, and thus the size (and cost) of power delivery wiring. An alternative to batteries is a [[motor–generator]] connected to a [[flywheel]] and diesel engine.

Many colocation facilities can provide redundant, A and B power feeds to customer equipment, and high end servers and telecommunications equipment often can have two power supplies installed.

Colocation facilities are sometimes connected to multiple sections of the utility power grid for additional reliability.

==Internal connections==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
Colocation facility owners have differing rules regarding cross-connects between their customers, some of whom may be carriers. These rules may allow customers to run such connections at no charge, or allow customers to order such connections for a monthly fee. They may allow customers to order cross-connects to carriers, but not to other customers. Some colocation centres feature a "[[meet-me-room]]" where the different carriers housed in the centre can efficiently exchange data.

Most [[peering]] points sit in colocation centres and because of the high concentration of servers inside larger colocation centres, most carriers will be interested in bringing direct connections to such buildings. In many cases, there will be a larger [[Internet Exchange Point|Internet Exchange]] hosted inside a colocation centre, where customers can connect for peering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn About Colocation Benefits And How To Get Started|url=https://www.psychz.net/client/kb/en/learn-about-colocation-benefits-and-how-to-get-started.html|website=Psychz.Net|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1534">'''Culinary theatre''' is the creation or enhancement of a spectacle during the service of food and beverages.  This form of theatrics aims to excite or even entertain the diner, patron or customer, usually without affecting the flavour of the food(s) and/or beverage(s) to be consumed. In its simplest form, this may include candles and/or [[sparkler]]s placed on a birthday cake, which give a dining room an exciting ambiance.

== Culinary theatrics in food service ==

It is a long established practice in many [[restaurant]]s and eateries to combine some element of theatrics into the dining experience for their patrons. [[Crêpes Suzette]], when served in medium to high-end restaurants, is traditionally served by being bussed out from the kitchen, and set alight just before being placed on the patron's table.&lt;ref&gt;History of Crêpes Suzette; www.whatscookingamerica.net; retrieved 17 August 2008 [http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CrepesSuzetteHistory.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flair bartending==
{{main|Flair bartending}}

The practice of enhancing the presentation of beverages, and especially [[cocktails]], by use of theatrics became increasingly elaborate over the 20th century. Such enhancement may include highly skilled and very fast-paced throwing, spinning, catching and juggling of liquor bottles (to the point of being a feature of the 1988 film [[Cocktail (1988 film)|''Cocktail'']]).

'''Deflagration'''  (Lat: ''de + flagrare'', "to burn down") is subsonic [[combustion]] propagating through [[heat transfer]]; hot burning material heats the next layer of cold material and ignites it. Most "[[fire]]s" found in daily life, from [[flame]]s to [[explosion]]s such as that of [[Gunpowder|Black powder]], are deflagrations.  This differs from [[detonation]], which propagates [[supersonic]]ally through [[shock wave]]s, decomposing a substance extremely quickly.

==Applications==
In engineering applications, deflagrations are easier to control than detonations. Consequently, they are  better suited when the goal is to move an object (a [[bullet]] in a gun, or a piston in an [[internal combustion engine]]) with the force of the expanding gas. Typical examples of deflagrations are the [[combustion]] of a gas-air mixture in a [[gas stove]] or a fuel-air mixture in an [[internal combustion engine]],  and the rapid burning of [[gunpowder]] in a firearm or of pyrotechnic mixtures in [[firework]]s.
Deflagration systems and products can also be used in mining, demolition and stone quarrying via [[gas pressure blasting]] as a beneficial alternative to high explosives.

==Oil/wax fire and water==
Adding water to a burning [[hydrocarbon]] such as oil or wax produces a deflagration. The water boils rapidly and ejects the burning material as a fine spray of droplets. A deflagration then occurs as the fine mist of oil ignites and burns extremely rapidly. These are particularly common in [[chip pan]] fires, which are responsible for one in five household fires in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fireservice.co.uk/safety/chip-pans UK Fire Service advice] on chip pan fires&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flame physics==
The underlying flame [[physics]] can be understood with the help of an idealized model consisting of a uniform one-dimensional tube of unburnt and burned gaseous fuel, separated by a thin transitional region of width &lt;math&gt;\delta\; &lt;/math&gt; in which the burning occurs. The burning region is commonly referred to as the [[flame]] or [[flame front]]. In equilibrium, thermal diffusion across the flame front is balanced by the heat supplied by burning.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (2018). Combustion theory. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landau, L. D. (1959). EM Lifshitz, Fluid Mechanics. Course of Theoretical Physics, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linan, A., &amp; Williams, F. A. (1993). Fundamental aspects of combustion.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeldovich, I. A., Barenblatt, G. I., Librovich, V. B., &amp; Makhviladze, G. M. (1985). Mathematical theory of combustion and explosions.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two characteristic timescales which are important here. The first is the [[thermal conduction|thermal diffusion]] timescale &lt;math&gt;\tau_d\;&lt;/math&gt;, which is approximately equal to

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_d \simeq \delta^2 / \kappa&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa \;&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal diffusivity]]. The second is the [[activation energy|burning timescale]] &lt;math&gt;\tau_b&lt;/math&gt; that strongly decreases with temperature, typically as

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b\propto \exp[\Delta U/(k_B T_f)]&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta U\;&lt;/math&gt; is the activation barrier for the burning reaction and &lt;math&gt;T_f\;&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature developed as the result of burning; the value of this so-called "flame temperature" can be determined from the laws of thermodynamics.

For a stationary moving deflagration front, these two timescales must be equal: the heat generated by burning is equal to the heat carried away by [[heat transfer]]. This makes it possible to calculate the characteristic width &lt;math&gt;\delta\;&lt;/math&gt; of the flame front:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b = \tau_d\;&lt;/math&gt;,

thus

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \simeq \sqrt {\kappa \tau_b} &lt;/math&gt;.

Now, the thermal flame front propagates at a characteristic speed &lt;math&gt;S_l\;&lt;/math&gt;, which is simply equal to the flame width divided by the burn time:

:&lt;math&gt;S_l \simeq \delta / \tau_b \simeq \sqrt {\kappa  / \tau_b} &lt;/math&gt;.

This simplified model neglects the change of temperature and thus the burning rate across the deflagration front. This model also neglects the possible influence of [[turbulence]]. As a result, this derivation gives only the [[laminar flame speed]] -- hence the designation &lt;math&gt;S_l\;&lt;/math&gt;.

==Damaging events==

Damage to buildings, equipment and people can result from a large-scale, short-duration deflagration.  The potential damage is primarily a function of the total amount of fuel burned in the event (total energy available), the maximum flame velocity that is achieved, and the manner in which the expansion of the combustion gases is contained.

In free-air deflagrations, there is a continuous variation in deflagration effects relative to the maximum flame velocity.  When flame velocities are low, the effect of a deflagration is to release heat. Some authors use the term [[flash fire]] to describe these low-speed deflagrations.  At flame velocities near the [[speed of sound]], the energy released is in the form of pressure and the results resemble a [[detonation]].  Between these extremes, both heat and pressure are generated.

When a low-speed deflagration occurs within a closed vessel or structure, [[adiabatic approximation|pressure effects]] can produce damage due to expansion of gases as a secondary effect. The heat released by the deflagration causes the combustion gases and excess air to expand thermally.  The net result is that the volume of the vessel or structure must expand to accommodate the hot combustion gases, or the vessel must be strong enough to withstand the additional internal pressure, or it fails, allowing the gases to escape. The risks of deflagration inside waste storage drums is a growing concern in storage facilities.

The '''Deutscher Verein des Gas- und Wasserfaches''' ('''DVGW''') is the [[Germany|German]] association for [[gas]] and [[water]] with headquarters in [[Bonn]]. Its official English translation is the German Technical and Scientific Association for Gas and Water.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dvgw.de/english-pages/dvgw/&lt;/ref&gt; The DVGW was founded in 1859. Its main task is to create the technical regulations for safety and reliability of gas and water supply.

==Regulation and standards==
In addition to the preparation of the national DVGW rules it also imports the [[DIN]], [[European Committee for Standardization|EN]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards.
The certification activities are done by DVGW CERT GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of DVGW.

'''Distributed Processing Technology''' (DPT) was founded in 1977, in [[Maitland, Florida]]. DPT was an early pioneer in [[computer data storage|computer storage]] technology, popularizing the use of disk caching in the 1980s and 1990s. DPT was the first company to design, manufacture and sell microprocessor-based intelligent [[cache (computing)|caching]] [[disk controller]]s to the [[OEM]] computer market. Prior to DPT, disk caching technology had been implemented in proprietary hardware in mainframe computing to improve the [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics|speed of disk access]].&lt;ref name=obj6:3&gt;{{cite journal|title=Maitland manufacturer's electronic part becomes darling of computer trade|journal=Orlando Business Journal|date=July 2–8, 1989|volume=6:3|url=http://www.stevegoldman.com/Publications/AboutSG/1989-07-02%20OBJ%20-%20Maitland%20Manufacturer's%20Electronic%20Part%20Becomes%20Darling%20of%20Computer%20Trade.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obj9:19/&gt;

'''Halda''' was founded in 1887 by [[Henning Hammarlund]] in [[Svängsta]] and was a Swedish manufacturer of pocketwatches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Halda: en svensk fickurfabrik|year=1987|author1=Sven Sandström |author2=Sture Carlsson|author3=Staffan Sjunnesson|editor=Stefan Sahlén|language=Swedish |location=Stockholm |publisher=Sveriges urmakareförb|id=LIBRIS-ID:730257}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Halda was given new life at the initiative of the watch entrepreneur and engineer [[Mikael Sandström]]&lt;ref name="watchtime"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.watchtime.com/2009/08/reborn-halda-watch-co-to-send-timepiece-into-space/ |title=Reborn Halda Watch Co. to Send Timepiece Into Space|work=watchtime.com |date=August 27, 2009 |author=Mike Disher |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Halda, Sweden's first pocketwatch factory ===
Halda was founded in 1887 by the factory owner [[Henning Hammarlund]] (1857-1922) in order to primarily produce [[pocket watch]]es. Its name is formed by a contraction of the founder's surname -'''Ha'''mmar'''l'''un'''d'''(''' a''').

Hammarlund had, after an education in particularly [[Switzerland]], returned to Sweden determined to start a Swedish pocketwatch factory. The location of this purpose he found in the small community of Svängsta by [[Mörrumsån]] in [[Blekinge]].
The first pocketwatches, ''Haldauren'' was presented 1889. In 1893, they were rewarded two medals at the World Exhibition in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. In 1890, Halda also began to produce [[typewriter]]s and [[taximeter]]s.

=== The company split ===
To cope with the ever-decreasing demand for pocket watches during [[World War I]], Hammarlund developed new ideas for the manufacturing of typewriters and taxi meters. After financial problems however, the pocket watch production was put down in 1917 (about 8,000 pocket watches was manufactured from 1888 to 1917) and in 1920 the company was [[liquidated]]. Instead, a new company, ''AB'' Halda Fabriker, took over the manufacturing of typewriters. The successful production of taximeters, took the ''Fabriks AB Halda taximeter'' (which is the origin of today's [[Haldex (company)|Haldex AB]] ([[gearboxes]], [[four-wheel drive]], etc.) and [[Halda Trancometer AB]] ([[taximeter]]s)) and production was moved to [[Halmstad]].

=== ABU takes over the pocket watch manufacturing ===
Even the production of pocket watches lived on under the watchmaker Carl Borgström's housing, an employee of the Halda Fickursfabrik since 1904. Borgström bought up the remaining stock of watch parts and some machinery and again, along with some watchmakers from Fickursfabriken, started produce watches. The company, ''AB'' Urfabriken (ABU), came to produce pocketwatches until 1926 and then included fishing equipment. ABU, now [[ABU-Garcia AB]], is still located in Svängsta.

=== AB Åtvidaberg Industries take over typewriter manufacturing ===
AB Halda Fabriker went bankrupt in 1927 each after the company name was changed again, this time to ''Halda AB''. The business grew throughout the 1930s. In 1938 Halda was taken over by [[AB Åtvidabergs Industrier]] and converted to a subsidiary under the name ''Facit-Halda AB''. Halda, however, had remained as a typewriter brand in the Åtvidaberg Group to the year 1957 when it switched to [[Facit AB]]. During the early 1970s, over 1,000 employees worked at the factory in Svängsta. During the late 1970s and 1980s, business was worse, and in 1987 (the same year as Halda turned 100 years old) the former owner, [[Ericsson]] announced that they sold Facit to the Norwegian Design Data. Facit Holding AB was formed in connection with this. Despite the production of electronic typewriters and focus on manufacturing personal computers and printed circuit boards the company's position deteriorated further. At the end of 1992-1993, the company went bankrupt, and the typewriter production in Svängsta was put down.

=== The brand resumes ===
In 2009, Halda was given new life at the initiative of the watch entrepreneur and engineer [[Mikael Sandström]] who developed a new watch with an innovative concept of a time-platform and two interchangeable time-modules. The 21st century Halda-watches are based on the same drive that [[Henning Hammarlund]] established: there is never room for compromise in quality or function. In developing the first modern Halda-watch, the company worked with the Swedish astronaut [[Christer Fuglesang]] who tested the watch on his space mission, [[STS-128]].&lt;ref name="watchtime" /&gt;

== Trip computers ==
Using their knowledge of taximeters the company created a series of trip computers for use in rallying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winktimber.com/vintagerally/gear/halda/hspdpilot_bj2.htm Motor Rally: The Magic Box], March 1956&lt;/ref&gt; The Halda Speedpilot was called "a considerable advance upon anything of the kind previously marketed, as regards usefulness, compactness, mechanical simplicity (and hence reliability), simplicity of operation and price" by Autosport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winktimber.com/vintagerally/gear/halda/hspdpilot_bj1.htm Autosport: A Most Accurate Average Speed Computer ], March 9, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ardrich A255P.jpg|thumb|The iconic Ardrich A255P Automatic Hand Dryer]]
[[File:Hand Dryer (Push Button), Lakones.JPG|thumb|right|A push-button hand dryer]]

'''Hand dryers''' are [[electric]] machines found in public [[bathroom]]s. They may either operate with the push of a [[Push-button|button]] or automatically using a [[sensor]]. [[Hand washing]] is an important part of [[hygiene]], and so an effective method of drying the hands is necessary.

== Costs ==
Hand dryers have been popular with industries for their apparent economies. According to manufacturers, hand dryers can cut costs by as much as 99.5% (for example a company may spend $2340.00 per year on paper towels, where as the hand dryer expenditure would be as low as $14.00 per year - this will vary according to the cost of paper towels and electricity). They require very little maintenance compared to paper towels, which must be replaced. An added benefit is the removal of the paper waste. Hand dryers represent a larger initial investment, so those responsible for [[facility management]] must do a careful cost analysis to determine whether they are cost effective in their building. Costs are always relative to the kWh cost that the facility is charged by its provider. In the UK, this will typically be around 10-12p, the only way to compare costs accurately is to work out the rated energy consumption and divide it by the number of drys the hand dryer is capable of performing back to back in 1 hour, this will give the energy consumption per dry. The world's lowest energy hand dryer uses just 1 watt-hour per dry and is rated at 0.24&amp;nbsp;kW.

== Effect on environment ==
[[File:Machine to dry hands in Costco.jpg|thumb|Newer model of hand dryer - [[Dyson Airblade]]]]
Due to the reduction in litter and waste in comparison with paper towels, which cannot be recycled,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmcc.nsw.gov.au/download.cfm?f=1445E7A1-423B-CE58-A98890179D3715EA Blue Mountains City Council Recycling FAQ]. ''"The paper fibre within tissues, paper towels and serviettes is too weak to be recycled."''&lt;/ref&gt; hand dryers are claimed to be better for the environment.{{by whom|date=February 2013}} Another study shows that whereas the majority of the environmental impact of a hand dryer occurs during its use, the environmental impact of paper towels is predominantly in the material production and manufacturing stages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exceldryer.com/PDFs/LCAFinal9-091.pdf "Comparative Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Hand Drying Systems"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that hand dryers use 5% less energy than paper towels in the first year, and 20% less over five years.&lt;ref name="straightdope"&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2721/whats-better-for-the-environment-electric-hand-dryers-or-paper-towels The Straight Dope: What's better for the environment, electric hand dryers or paper towels?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[World Dryer]] study of 102 hand dryers installed in public schools in Topeka, Kansas, claimed an annual savings of 34.5 tons of solid waste, 690,000 gallons of water,and 587 trees; another World Dryer study of 153 hand dryers in the Iowa state capitol showed an annual savings of 10.5 tons of solid waste and 176 trees.&lt;ref name="straightdope" /&gt; However, a Dutch study published in March 1995 indicated that there was environmental parity between hand dryers and paper towels as hand drying methods when all factors were taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Ir J. Potting, Ir J.P. Groot-Marcus, M.P. van Golen; Levenscyclusanalyse van drie handdroogsystemen; March 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hygiene ==
In 2009 a published study was conducted by the [[University of Westminster]] to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, warm air hand dryers and the more modern jet-air hand dryers.&lt;ref name="westminsterstudy"&gt;[http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090402-2008%20WUS%20Westminster%20University%20hygiene%20study,%20nov2008.pdf A comparative study of three different hand drying methods: paper towel, warm air dryer, jet air dryer’] by Keith Redway and Shameem Fawdar of the School of Biosciences, University of Westminster London&lt;/ref&gt; It found that after washing and drying hands with the warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to ''increase'' on average on the finger pads by 194% and on the palms by 254%; drying with the jet air dryer resulted in an ''increase'' on average of the total number of bacteria on the finger pads by 42% and on the palms by 15%; and after washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was ''reduced'' on average on the finger pads by up to 76% and on the palms by up to 77%.&lt;ref name="westminsterstudy" /&gt;

The scientists also carried out tests to establish whether there was the potential for cross contamination of other washroom users and the washroom environment as a result of each type of drying method. They found that:
* the jet air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of 400&amp;nbsp;mph (≈640&amp;nbsp;km/h), was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 metres away
* use of a warm air hand dryer spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer
* paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms.

In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;TÜV Produkt und Umwelt GmbH Report No. 425-452006 [http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090410%20T%C3%9CV%20-%20Study%20of%20different%20methods%20used%20for%20drying%20hands%20Sept%202005.pdf A report concerning a study conducted with regard to the different methods used for drying hands; September 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  Drying method
!  Effect on Bacterial Count
|-
|Paper towels and roll
|Decrease of 24%
|-
|Hot-air dryer
|Increase of 117%
|}

Another paper found that air dryers dispersed{{Specify|date=May 2010}} marker bacteria in a radius of three feet (one metre) and onto the investigator's [[white coat|laboratory coat]].&lt;ref&gt;Ngeow YF, Ong HW, Tan P. Dispersal of bacteria by an electric air hand dryer. Malays J Pathol. 1989 Aug;11:53-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study found that hot air dryers had the capacity to increase the bacterial count on the skin, and that paper towel drying decreased skin bacterial count.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Montville, Yuhuan Chen and Donald W. Schaffner, Risk assessment of hand washing efficacy using literature and experimental data, International Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 73, Issues 2-3, 11 March 2002, Pages 305-313&lt;/ref&gt;  This is corroborated by another study which found that the mechanical action of paper towel drying removed bacteria, something air dryers cannot do.&lt;ref&gt;Gould D. The significance of hand-drying in the prevention of infection. Nurs Times. 1994 Nov 23-29;90(47):33-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctors at the University of Ottawa claim that "the blowing of warm air may lead to an accelerated dehydration of the skin surface, thereby affecting the viability" of the microorganisms, and that the warm air may "penetrate all the crevices in the skin, whereas absorbent towels may not reach such areas, even though the skin appears dryer".&lt;ref&gt;Ansari, Shamin A., et al.

The European Tissue Symposium, a trade body, has produced a position statement on the hygiene standards of different hand drying systems. This summarises some of the scientific research undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;European Tissue Symposium [http://www.europeantissue.com/item.aspx?id=332 Hand drying systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyson (creators of the [[Dyson Airblade]] dryer) have countered the claims presented, suggesting that the results were intentionally falsified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airblade.hu/legutobbi-hirek/time-for-kimberly-clark-to-throw-in-the-towel-dyson-delivers-10-knockout-blows-to-kimberly-clark%E2%80%99s-campaign Time for Kimberly Clark to throw in the towel?

==Noise==
Many people object to the loud noise that hand dryers make. Typically, installed hand dryers make over 80 [[decibel]]s of sound at a [[distance]] of {{convert|10|feet|m|abbr=on}} while in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.4103/1463-1741.153394| pmid = 25774611| pmc = 4918665| title = Hand dryer noise in public restrooms exceeds 80 dBA at 10 ft (3 m)| journal = Noise and Health| volume = 17| issue = 75| pages = 90–2| year = 2015| last1 = Berkowitz| first1 = Sharisalzhauer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Research conducted in 2008 indicated that European consumers much prefer hand towels over hand dryers in public washrooms. 63% of respondents said paper towels were their preferred drying method, while just 28% preferred a hand dryer. Respondents overwhelmingly considered paper towels to offer faster hand drying than electric hand dryers (68% vs 14%). On the whole they also considered paper towels to be the most hygienic form of hand drying in public washrooms (53% vs 44%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090415%20Intermetra%20Users%20preference%20study%204%20countries%202008%20Report%20June%202008.pdf Intermetra, June 2008 - User's preferences in hand drying systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest hand dryer was patented in 1921 by R.B. Hibbard, D. J. Watrous and J.G. Bassett for the Airdry Corporation of Groton New York.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/indexofpatentsis1922unit/indexofpatentsis1922unit_djvu.txt Full text of "Index of patents issued from the United States Patent Office"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This machine was sold as a built in model or freestanding floor unit that consisted of an inverted blower (much like a handheld blow dryer) that was controlled by a floor pedal. Known as "Airdry The Electric Towel", these units were used in restrooms, barbershops and factories. Airdry Corporation moved to Chicago and San Francisco in 1924 to centralize their distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mocavo.com/Journal-of-Electricity-Jan-1-Jun-15-1924-Volume-52/305420/529 Mocavo and Findmypast are coming together | findmypast.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The hand dryer was later popularized in 1948 by George Clemens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exceldryer.com/PDFs/BuildingServicesManagement-BlowingHotAir.pdf http://www.exceldryer.com/PDFs/BuildingServicesManagement-BlowingHotAir.pdf] Accessed June 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993, [[Mitsubishi Electric]] introduced a new type of hand dryer that blows jets of air on both sides of the hand, pushing the water off rather than evaporating it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitsubishielectric.co.jp/service/jettowel/support/history.pdf Jet Towel - History of evolution] (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Helicopter Aircrew Breathing Device''' or '''HABD''' (also known as a '''HEED''' or '''SEA''' [http://www.aviationsurvival.com/HEEDS-III-Air_c_11.html]) is a piece of military survival gear which was adopted in order to increase the chances of survival for embarked troops and aircrew trapped in an aircraft which has ditched (crashed into a body of water.) Similar in function to [[Scuba set|SCUBA]] gear, it consists of a small cylinder pressurized with atmospheric air and first stage [[Diving regulator|regulator]] worn in a pouch on the user's [[Personal flotation device|life vest]]; a [[pressure gauge]]; an air hose and a special second-stage regulator (the part that delivers air via the user's mouth). The regulator is on-demand (it only delivers air when the user breathes in) and is designed to be highly rugged in order to survive impacts associated with emergency ditchings.

Since a full-size SCUBA cylinder would be prohibitively bulky, especially for troops already laden with full combat gear, the HABD must be small and thus limited in capacity. It provides roughly two minutes of air at the surface. This decreases rapidly with depth and with the heightened breathing rate that accompanies stress. Still, even a few breaths in such a situation can mean the difference between life and death.

Helicopter ditchings usually come with little warning, often while the pilot is attempting a ship landing or other low-altitude maneuver. Because they are top-heavy, ditched helicopters invariably flip upside-down upon hitting the water. The crew and embarked troops will be bombarded with violent jerking motions and several tons of incoming water, which causes unsecured gear to fly uncontrolled throughout the cabin and can knock troops unconscious. [[Jet fuel]] and [[hydraulic fluid]] often seep into the cabin and can cause blindness to open eyes and lung damage if inhaled. Troops unfortunate enough to find themselves in a ditched helicopter will be upside-down, disoriented, often in the dark and in a rapidly sinking bird. Immersion in cold water evokes a "gasp" response in humans, which limits their breath-holding ability to as little as 15 seconds. Panic is fatal. The HABD, properly used, provides troops with an invaluable tool to help ward off panic and buys them precious extra time to escape.

The Helicopter Emergency Egress Device (HEED) was introduced to the USAF by MSgt Andre' K. Leamons after losing a helicopter and crew off Kadena Japan in the late 1980s.  Sergeant Leamons was the Life Support Superintendent for Air Rescue Service and introduced the HEED bottle to be included on crewmember survival vest for all Air Rescue Service members who flew over water. In the event of ditching, the HEED would provide additional time to escape from a submerged helicopter.  MSgt Leamons found that the helicopter would turn over because the weight of the motor and rotor blades and sink upside down until it reached neutral buoyancy, which would leave the aircraft just below the surface.  The HEED bottle would supply about 2–3 minutes of air, just enough to allow the crew to escape the aircraft and swim to the surface.

'''Iamus''' is a [[computer cluster]] (a half-cabinet encased in a custom shell) located at [[University of Málaga|Universidad de Málaga]]. Powered by [[Melomics]]' technology, the composing module of Iamus takes 8 minutes to create a full composition in different musical formats, although the native representation can be obtained by the whole system in less than a second (on average). Iamus only composes full pieces of [[contemporary classical music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diaz-Jerez|first=Gustavo|title=Composing with Melomics: delving into the computational world for musical inspiration|journal=Leonardo Music Journal|year=2011|volume=21|pages=13–14|doi=10.1162/LMJ_a_00053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iamus' ''Opus one'', created on October 15, 2010 is the first fragment of professional contemporary classical music ever composed by a computer in its own style&lt;ref&gt;{{cite   journal | title= Computer composer honours Turing's centenary| journal= ''New Scientist''| date =5 July 2012| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724.300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (rather than attempting to emulate the style of existing composers as was previously done by [[David Cope]]). Iamus's first full composition, ''[[Hello World! (composition)|Hello World!]]'', premiered exactly one year after the creation of ''Opus one'', on October 15, 2011. Four of Iamus's works premiered on July 2, 2012, and were broadcast live&lt;ref name=iamus-CD&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Philip|title=Iamus, classical music's computer composer, live from Malaga|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/01/iamus-hello-world-review?newsfeed=true|accessdate=2 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the School of Computer Science at Universidad de Málaga&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=School of Computer Science (University of Malaga - Spain) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygMRtXxqEBw&amp;feature=plcp |title=Can machines be creative?

The compositions performed at this event were later recorded by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], creating the album ''[[Iamus (album)|Iamus]]'', which ''[[New Scientist]]'' reported as the "first complete album to be composed solely by a computer and recorded by human musicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal | title=Computer composer honours Turing's centenary|journal=''New Scientist''|date=5 July 2012|url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724.300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the authenticity of the music, Stephen Smoliar, critic of classical music at ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', commented "What is primary is the act of making the music itself engaged by the performers and how the listener responds to what those performers do... what is most interesting about the documents generated by Iamus is their capacity to challenge the creative talents of performing musicians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smoliar|first=Stephen|title=Thoughts about Iamus and the composition of music by computer|newspaper=The Examiner|date=4 January 2013}} Accessed: 10 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6317">An '''Instrument Driver''', in the context of test and measurement (T&amp;M) application development, is a set of software routines that simplifies remote [[instrument control]]. Instrument Drivers are specified by the IVI Foundation&lt;ref name="IVI Foundation"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ivifoundation.org/ |publisher=IVI Foundation |title=IVI Foundation Specifications}}&lt;/ref&gt; and define an [[Input/output|I/O]] abstraction layer using [[Virtual Instrument Software Architecture]] (VISA). The VISA hardware abstraction layer provides an interface-independent communication channel to T&amp;M instruments. Furthermore, the Instrument Drivers encapsulate the [[Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments]] (SCPI) commands, which are an [[ASCII]]-based set of commands for reading and writing instrument settings and measurement data. This standard allows an abstract way of using various [[programming language]]s to program remote-control applications instead of using SCPI commands. An Instrument Driver usually has a well-defined [[Application programming interface|API]].

==Standards==
===VXIplug&amp;play Instrument Driver===

The VXIplug&amp;play Systems Alliance was founded in 1993&lt;ref name="VXIplug&amp;play Alliance"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ivifoundation.org/VXIPlug_Play/default.aspx
|publisher=IVI Foundation |title=VXIplug&amp;play Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of unifying VXI hardware and software to achieve 'plug and play' interoperability for [[VXI]] and [[GPIB]] instruments. As part of the unifying process, VXIplug&amp;play instrument drivers&lt;ref name="VPP-3.1: Instrument Drivers Architecture an Design Specification"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ivifoundation.org/docs/vpp2-2010-02-24.pdf
|publisher=IVI Foundation |title=VPP-3.1: Instrument Drivers Architecture an Design Specification}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also defined.

===IVI Instrument Drivers===

When the IVI Foundation took over the Alliance in 2002, it defined a new generation of instrument drivers to replace the VXIplug&amp;play standard. The IVI instrument driver specification intends to overcome the drawbacks of VXIplug&amp;play. These IVI (Interchangeable Virtual Instrumentation) drivers&lt;ref name="IVI Driver Specifications"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ivifoundation.org/specifications/default.aspx
|publisher=IVI Foundation |title=IVI Driver Specifications}}&lt;/ref&gt; are currently defined in three different architectures:

# The IVI-[[Component Object Model|COM]] driver architecture&lt;ref name="IVI-3.1: Driver Architecture Specification"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ivifoundation.org/downloads/Architecture%20Specifications/IVI-3.1_Architecture_2012-08-06.pdf
|publisher=IVI Foundation |title=IVI-3.1: Driver Architecture Specification}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the Microsoft [[Component Object Model]]. 
# The IVI-C drivers are based on [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] shared components (shared libraries). 
# The IVI[[.NET Framework|.NET]] driver architecture was specified in 2010.&lt;ref name="IVI-3.1: Driver Architecture Specification"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IVI-3.18: IVI.NET Utility Classes and Interfaces Specification"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ivifoundation.org/downloads/Architecture%20Specifications/IVI-3.18_.NET_Utility_Classes_and_Interfaces_2011-06-30.pdf
|publisher=IVI Foundation |title=IVI-3.18: IVI.NET Utility Classes and Interfaces Specification}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IVI.NET drivers are based on the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] framework.

==Remote Control of Instrumentation==
Instrument Drivers allow quicker development of remote-control applications for instrumentation. The drivers reduce the difficulty of string formatting when using [[Standard Commands for Programmable Instrumentation|SCPI]] commands by providing a well-defined [[API]]. The IVI and VXIplug&amp;play Instrument Drivers use the VISA as the hardware abstraction layer so that hardware-independent applications can be developed.

==I/O Hardware Abstraction Layer VISA==
The [[Virtual Instrument Software Architecture|VISA]] library allows test &amp; measurement equipment to be connected through various hardware interfaces. The following interfaces are available:

* [[Serial port|Serial Port]]
* [[GPIB]]/[[IEEE-488]]
* VXI-11&lt;ref name="VXI-11 Bus Specification"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vxibus.org/?q=node/206
|publisher=VXI Bus Consortium |title=VXI-11 Bus Specification}}&lt;/ref&gt; (over [[TCPIP]])

===LXI===

The [[LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation| LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation (LXI)]] standard defines the communications protocols for controlling test and measurement systems using [[Ethernet]]. The standard requires vendors to offer IVI compliant instrument drivers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3506">An '''integrative level''', or '''level of organization''', is a set of phenomena [[emergence|emerging]] from pre-existing phenomena of a lower level. The levels concept is an intellectual framework for structuring reality. It arranges all material entities and all processes in the universe into a hierarchy based on how complex the entity's organization is. When arranged this way, each entity is three things at the same time: It is made up of parts from the previous level below. It is a whole in its own right. And it is a part of the whole that is on the next level above. Typical examples include [[life]] emerging from non-living substances, and [[consciousness]] emerging from [[nervous system]]s. 

==Levels==
The main levels usually acknowledged are those of [[matter]], [[life]], [[mind]], and [[society]]. These are called ''strata'' in [[Nicolai Hartmann]]'s ontology. They can be further analyzed into more specific ''layers'', such as those of particles, atoms, molecules, and rocks forming the material stratum, or those of cells, organisms, populations, and ecosystems forming the life stratum.

The sequence of levels is often described as one of increasing [[complexity]], although it is not clear whether this is always true: for example, [[parasitism]] emerges on pre-existing organisms, although parasites are often simpler than their originating forms.

==Philosophies==

Ideas connected to integrative levels can be found in the works of both [[materialism|materialist]] philosophers,  and [[Idealism|anti-materialist]] ones.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2011}}

The '''Japanese kitchen''' ({{lang-ja|台所|translit=Daidokoro|lit=kitchen}}) is the place where food is prepared in a [[Housing in Japan|Japanese house]]. Until the [[Meiji era]], a kitchen was also called ''kamado'' ({{lang|ja|かまど}}; lit. [[stove]]) and there are many sayings in the [[Japanese language]] that involve kamado as it was considered the symbol of a house. The term could even be used to mean "family" or "household" (much as "hearth" does in English). Separating a family was called ''kamado wo wakeru'', or "divide the stove". ''Kamado wo yaburu'' (lit. "break the stove") means that the family was broken.

==Early history==
In the [[Jōmon]] period, from the [[10th millennium BC|10,000 BC]] to 300 BC, people gathered into villages, where they lived in shallow [[Pit-house|pit]] [[dwelling]]s. These simple huts were between 10 and 30 square meters and had a [[hearth]] in the center. Early stoves were nothing more than a shallow pit (''jikaro'' 地床炉), but they were soon surrounded by stones to catch the fire sparks.  A bottomless clay vase soon replaced the stones as these became hot quickly and occupants had to be careful around a stove. This type of stove is called ''umigamero'' (埋甕炉; lit. "buried vase stove"). As the stove became safer, it was moved from the center of house to the side and, by the late [[Kofun]] period (6th century), almost all houses had a stove at one end of the house. Some rich families in the Kofun period built a separate house where cooking was done.  In these houses, food was stored in sacks and pots in a hole dug on the floor.  Houses were constructed near a river or a spring for easy access to water.

In the [[Yayoi]] period (300 BC to AD 250) the cultivation of rice became widespread, and villages would be constructed near a marsh and a lowland.  The water was muddy and ''Asaido'' (浅井戸) were constructed.  An asaido was filled with sand and pebbles through which the water flowed to filter out mud and larger organisms.  Some villages stored food outside a house in a large storehouse.

The [[kitchen]] remained unchanged for over 500 years, between the [[Nara period]] in the 8th century until the [[Muromachi period]] (1336&amp;ndash;1573).  Kitchens were furnished with the following items:
&lt;!--This list probably should be in a separate article. But don't make the change yet.--&gt;

*''Ashikanahe'' or ''Ashimarokanahe'' (足釜) - A nine- or ten-legged iron pot.
*''Kakekanahe'' or ''Kakemarokanahe'' (懸釜) - An iron pot that was fitted over a stove.  It had a "fringe" that let it hang on the stove and was used to boil cook rice into [[kayu]].
*''Yukikamado'' (行竈) - A pot, with a stove attached, that could be carried around
*''Koshiki'' (橧 or 甑) - A wooden basket placed on top of a pot to [[steaming|steam cook]] rice.
*''Nabe'' (堝 or 鍋) -  made of [[clay]] or of [[metal]].  Primarily used to make stews and a side dish as well as to boil water.
*''Sashinabe'' (佐志奈閇) - A small pot with a long handle used to warm [[sake]] in a bottle.
*''Hiraka'' or ''Hotogi'' (瓫) - A large clay pot, larger than a nabe, used to boil water.
*''[[Kamado]]'' - Also called ''Mushikamado'': the stove itself, constructed with stones, tiles, and clay.
*''Karakamado'' (韓竈) - A set of koshiki, ''kanahe'' (釜), and kamado that can be carried around.
*''Takigi'' (薪) - In the Nara period, "薪" was read as "takigi" not "maki".  Dried wood was used as fuel.
*''Oke'' (麻筒) - A tub or a pail in three sizes: large, medium, and small. A flat bottomed and shallow tub was also used.
*''Shaku'' (杓) - Also read as ''Hisago''.  A wooden ladle used to scoop cold and hot water from an ''oke''.
*''Katana'' (刀子) - A cooking [[knife]] and not a [[katana]].
*''Kiritsukue'' or ''Sekki'' (切机) - A ''Manaita'' (俎) or a cutting board.
*''Fune'' (船) - A large wooden tub used for washing.
*''Shitami'' (籮) - A coarse hemp cloth used to squeeze water out or to dry foods by spreading over it.
*''Kame'' (甕) - A large vase where foods were stored.

In the [[Heian period]] (794&amp;ndash;1185), the first usage of the precursor to "daidokoro", or pantry, was recorded.  The imperial palace of Heian had four rooms dedicated to preparing foods, ''[[Oni (Japanese folklore)|oni]] no ma'' (鬼の間), ''daibandokoro'' (台盤所), ''asagarei no ma'' (朝餉の間), and ''Ōidono'' (大炊殿). "Oni no ma" was the room used for checking for poison and tasting before serving.  "Asagarei no ma" was the room for eating breakfast. "Ōidono" was the room to cook foods and was placed to the north and as far away as possible from living quarters.  "Daibandokoro" was the room used to serve foods onto a ''daiban'' (台盤), a lacquered wooden table. Maid servants also ate and waited to serve meals in the daibandokoro.

[[File:Traditionelle japanische Haushaltsgegenstände III.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional Japanese kitchen, Boso-no-Mura Museum, Inba-gun, [[Chiba-ken]], Japan]]
In the [[Kamakura period]] (1185&amp;ndash;1333), as the [[Shoinzukuri]] style of housing became common, the kitchen was gradually absorbed into the house.  Until then, a kitchen was built as a separate house whenever possible to avoid smells and smoke, and to prevent possible kitchen fires from spreading to the primary residence.  Kamakura era kitchens did not include essential kitchen furnishings, such as a sink or a well.

==Fire and water==

===Stoves===
[[Image:Kamado4816.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A ''[[kamado]]'' in a traditional Japanese kitchen.]]
The earliest dwellings in Japan used an open fire [[hearth]] for cooking. The first stove was recorded in the [[Kofun period]], between the 3rd to 6th century. These stoves, called ''[[kamado]]'',  were typically made of clay and sand; they were fired through a hole in the front and had a hole in the top, into which a pot could be suspended from its rim. This type of stove remained in use for centuries to come, with only minor modifications. In the 14th century, in the [[Muromachi period]], stoves with two holes were recorded in drawings. By the early 17th century, the beginning of the [[Edo period]], large stoves with several cooking holes were common in the kitchens of the upper class house as well as in large restaurants. It is believed{{By whom|date=June 2011}} these multiple hole types appeared earlier than recorded but were omitted from drawings of the time because inclusion of a single hole stove was sufficient to indicate a kitchen.  The stove was low, meaning cooks had to squat to cook. In the larger kitchens, especially those of palaces and temples, raised ''[[kamado]]'' that could be operated while standing up were developed in the [[Edo period]] (1603&amp;ndash;1867).

''Irori'' (囲炉裏) appeared in the Kofun period and served as a secondary stove.  A section of wooden panels were removed from the floor and a lacquered square wooden frame was fitted in the place.  The frame was filled with sand and an iron hook was lowered from the ceiling.  Foods were reheated or cooked over in an iron pot hung from a hook and the fire served as a heat source.  This type of stove became common in many homes by the early Nara period and a smaller irori is the center piece of a [[tea house]].

A third type of stove, a ''hibachi'' (火鉢) lit. "fire pot", appeared as late as the early Heian period but is likely to have been used earlier.  A hibachi is a deep small pot half filled with sand and ash and a small fire was started in the pot.  It was used as a safer form of heating equipment than was available previously and could be used to cook small morsels of food.

===Water===
Fire was a part of a kitchen from the start, but water was late in becoming a part.

In the [[Yayoi]] period (300 B.C. to A.D. 250), the cultivation of rice became widespread, and villages would be constructed near a marsh and a lowland.  The water was muddy and ''asaido'' (浅井戸) lit.) shallow wells, were constructed.  An asaido was filled with sand and pebbles through which the water flowed to filter out mud and larger organisms.  A deeper well was also dug and sometimes a hollowed log was inserted into the well to prevent the walls' collapse.  A pot was used to scoop water.

It was not long before people started improving on these primitive wells.  The area around a well was tiled with stones, then ''fune'' (水船) was invented. Wooden or bamboo shafts were used to carry water from nearby wells and springs to a fune or manually filled by women.  Water was carried from these fune to a water vase from where it was used.  Sometimes a fune was made inside a house, but it did not have the function of a sink. It was used to collect and store water and nothing more.  Fune later became a part of a [[Japanese garden]].

The first time that a sink appeared in a drawing was in the ''Bokie'' (慕帰絵) written in the early [[Muromachi period]]. The kitchen of the Nanrou temple (南瀧院) had a large ''sunokoyuka'' (すのこ床) lit. drainboard floor, next to a stove with a water filled ''oke'' and ''hisyaku'' (''syaku'') for washing.  This sunokoyuka was made with split bamboo and water would drain through gaps between the canes.  Even though in many places a sunokoyuka was made over a river and washing was done, to make a part of the kitchen floor into sunokoyuka to use as a drain was an innovation. This did not pose a health problem as kitchen scraps were meticulously collected and used to make a compost. Few Japanese ate meat due to the Emperor's decree in the 8th century and animals and birds were slaughtered away from a house.  Until late [[Edo period]], this type of kitchen was widely used.

==Shoinzukuri and the kitchen==
[[Shoinzukuri]] became the standard style of building a house beginning in 13th century and it was revolutionary for combining fire (stove) and water (well and drain) into a single place.  It was still few steps short of a kitchen.  In the early stage of Shoinzukuri style, instead of the kitchen being a room inside the ''omoya'' (母屋) or the main building, it was connected by a corridor and existed inside one of many sub-buildings.  However, it did have a ''kamado'', a ''irori'', a well, and a ''sunokoyuka'' in the same room.

In the [[Edo period]] (1603 to 1868), ''daidokoro'' came to mean "kitchen" and became an integrated part of the house.  It was, however, more common to call it ''katte'' (勝手) which is used to mean the "back door." The pantry room was called ''ozenntate'' (御膳立).  Upper class houses were well stocked and extremely large by today's standard.  The country house of [[Tokugawa Mitsukuni]], known as a gourmet of Edo period, had kitchen spaces at least 34 ''jyou'' or about 53 square metres. This is more than one-third of the entire house and does not include the [[sake]] storage room or the pantry.  Some kitchens had running water by having bamboo shafts connected to the water source extend into the kitchen; users of less well equipped kitchens fetched water from a common well.  A separate kitchen within the house had become customary and all but the smallest single-room houses had one.

Storage in kitchens was provided by ''mizuya [[tansu]]''. These are Japanese style chests, often with a mix of compartments behind sliding doors and drawers of varying sizes. These are still available today as antiques, or altered reproductions tailored to a more modern/western style of kitchen.

==Industrialization==
An American scientist, [[Edward S. Morse]], recorded many of the kitchens in urban and rural areas in the early [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912). These kitchens were not much different from those in the Edo period as home use of gas and electricity had only just begun in America and Europe. Though it was costly to lay down infrastructures, these were dutifully laid down, with heavy subsidization by semi-private and national companies.

The early 1900s brought a change in [[Japanese cuisine]]. Foreign cuisines from every part of the world flooded Japanese cookbooks, part of the ''haikara'' boom (ハイカラ, literally high collared, taken from high-collared coats popular in Europe).  Popular dishes like curried rice, [[sukiyaki]], [[ramen]], and [[gyūdon]] appeared during the Meiji period as a part of the haikara movement and represented a fusing of traditional Japanese cuisines with other cuisines. Kitchens were completely reorganized to cook these foods; kitchens of the Edo period were used for simple menus of rice, broiled fish, vegetable soup, and pickled vegetables.

The first gas light was installed in Yokohama by 1873, but it would be more than 30 years before advertisements for the gas started appearing in newspapers.  These ads were not directed at middle to lower classes.  In the 1908 study of how gas was used in [[Tokyo]], 57% was for lighting, 14% was for fuel, 19% was for powering motors, and 3% was for streetlights. This meant that gas was used to light only 1 out of 9 households and only 1 out of 100 households used gas for cooking.  Gas companies realized this, and early appliances were directly imported from England which made them too costly for all but the richest citizens.

The Japanese kitchen turned away from American and European kitchens at this point. The first item of the industrialization to be introduced to most houses was the gas-heated rice cooker. A gas stove were introduced much later as the cost of gas was still too high for most homes. A gas oven, often an essential part of the kitchen in many American and European houses, never made it into most Japanese households because dishes requiring cooking in an oven, such as roasted chicken and baked pies, became popular only much later.  Instead of an oven, a smaller fish oven was fitted into a gas stove.  The gas-heated rice cooker remained in use until the 1970s in many houses and was eventually be replaced by the electric rice cooker.

In the 1920s, electricity became more widespread in homes in Japan. In ''Nihonkatei daihyakkajiten'' (literally ''Encyclopedia of Japanese Household'') published in 1927, there is already an entry of "katei denka" meaning a completely electric house.  It says,

:The most important reason to use electricity for all needs of a house, lighting, heat, power is because it will help women to work, increasing their efficiency, make living easier and comfortable, and also make it economical.  There must be several electrical outlets in each room to easily use an appliance like electric heater.  They also let occupants use electric light at any time and no one can forget the comfort of using appliances like an electric fan, an electric heater, an electric toaster, a coffee maker, an electric iron, and an electric curling iron.

:...Placing various electric appliances (in a kitchen) and cooking with them is essential to making it easier to work in this small space.   An electric stove, an electric oven, an electric refrigerator, an electric dishwashers, etc. must be wired properly in appropriate spaces.

This, however, did not mean that a completely electric house had become common.  On 1937, J. G. Douglass from [[General Electric]] conducted a half-year research on how many electric appliances made into a common household.  According to this report:

* Electric iron - 3,131,000 (approximately 120,000 in Tokyo area)
* Refrigerator - 12,215 (4,700)
* Room cooler - 260 (125)
* Vacuum cleaner - 6,610 (3,100)
* Washing machine - 3,197 (1,590)

This research project also predicted that four years later, in 1941, electric appliances should be much more widely used.  A 490% increase was predicted for the refrigerator, 470% increase for the vacuum cleaner, and 150% increase for iron.

The first public water service began on October 17, 1887 in Yokohama. By the early 1900s, most major cities had water services.  However, these water pipes often led to public water taps.  In 1892, a survey conducted in Yokohama revealed that less than 1 in 4 households had a private water tap.  18,184 households used public water taps, while only 5,120 household used private water taps.  By the 1930s, most new houses were constructed with a private water taps, but it would take another 30 years to become available in a village far from a city.

==The "Average person's dream kitchen"==
In 1912, a progressive woman's magazine ''Fujin no tomo'' (婦人の友) ran a contest for a ''heiminteki risouno daidokoro'' (平民的理想の台所), or "average person's dream kitchen."  ''Heimin,'' literally "average person," was a popular phrase in the 1910s and 1920s, and it implied a well-educated and progressive person.  Fifty-two contest entries were sent by readers, and two were awarded grand prizes.  These winners were called "the city kitchen" and "the village kitchen".

The city kitchen was about 15.5 square metres in size and was intended to be used by a wife and her mother-in-law. The kitchen had doors leading to the dining room, the bath, and the laundry area. It had a wooden floor, roughly one-fourth of which included underfloor food storage lined with concrete.  Two kamado were at one end, and a separate portable stove using charcoal was set up in the middle of the room.  Next to the kamado was a stone sink without a water tap.  Next to this sink were storage shelves with pots and pans on top, washed dishes in the middle, and vegetables and [[miso]] on the bottom.  Next to the portable stove was a large food preparation table, with several drawers to store cooking utensils.  Staples such as rice, sugar, and flour were kept in pots beneath this table.  Additional shelves at the other end of the room could be accessed from both the kitchen and the dining room.  Next to these shelves was another preparation table where foods were served onto individual dishes and then carried to the dining room.  Kitchen windows and [[shoji]] were installed with glass panes to make the kitchen brighter, and electric lights were hung from the ceiling.   This "dream kitchen" was spacious by today's standards, yet it lacked most modern post-industrial conveniences, although many smaller improvements had been made.

Also around this time, many families started to use a low table called ''[[chabudai]]''.  Everyone sat around it, rather than using individual ''daiban''.  Until the 1960s, sitting on chairs and eating around a dining table was considered "haikara".

==The kitchen in the Taishō period==
In the [[Taishō period]] (1912&amp;ndash;1926), a popular movement called "Taishō Democracy" began.  Its main focus was on universal [[suffrage]] for males, and this movement extended into other fields, serving as a modernization effort similar to the [[Meiji Restoration]].  The kitchen was affected.

Before the Taishō period, the kitchen was constructed so that most tasks could be done while sitting, crouching, or kneeling.  This was due to long preparation and cooking times and helped keep the stove low to prevent the spread of fire.  As gas stoves and European-style clothes became popular, kitchens were redesigned so they could be used while standing.  A second innovation was that instead of placing the stove and water sink in a sunken, dirt-floored section of the kitchen, the stove was constructed on the same level as the rest of the kitchen, eliminating the need for stepping into footwear to attend it.

In 1922, Suzuki Shougyou began marketing a customizable kitchen set that came to be called the "System Kitchen."  Many of its parts were prefabricated, and it could be made to fit in a space anywhere from 1.8 to 2.7 metres, the length of one to one-and-one-half [[tatami]] mats.  The System Kitchen had a water sink, a cutting board, two or more gas stoves (not included), and cabinets for storage.  This Suzuki kitchen was expensive, costing 120 yen at a time when a first-year bank worker earned only 50 yen per month.  Today the same worker earns over 240,000 yen or about 2,400 dollars in a month.

By the end of the Taishō period, it was becoming increasingly difficult to have a maid to help around the house.  This means that the kitchen had to be smaller for a housewife working alone.  Whereas a European [[Frankfurt kitchen]] measured 1.9m by 3.4m, or 6.46 square metres, Japanese pushed for an even smaller size, 1 [[tsubo]] or 3.3 square metres, the area of two tatami mats.  Three sides of these kitchens were filled with cupboards, stoves, storage areas, and a water sink.

==The post-war kitchen==
Many Japanese houses were destroyed in [[World War II]]. Rebuilding allowed architects to freely redesign houses as well as kitchens.  The influence of Edo-period lifestyles was now nearly gone.  Electricity and gas were built into kitchens, and designs reflected this change.  An electric refrigerator, a luxury item before the war, became a standard item in the 1950s, along with an electric washing machine and a black-and-white television.  However, early post-war housing projects were often poorly designed.  Sometimes architects simply copied plans for American or European housing projects, with only minor modifications to better suit Japanese families.  Kitchens were small and soon became cluttered with new electric appliances.

The "System Kitchen" approach to design was intended to make the kitchen easier for the average housewife to use.  Since most families cook many types of [[cuisine]] in their kitchens, a streamlined cooking process was studied, focusing on how the kitchen was actually used.  In a system kitchen, the refrigerator and other electrical appliances were placed in predesigned locations, and storage spaces were subdivided to house pots, pans and kitchen utensils.

==Contemporary==
[[File:Typicalnewjapanesekitchen.JPG|right|thumb|A typical Japanese kitchen.]]
A typical modern Japanese kitchen includes the following:
* Counter: [[Countertop]] is usually made of [[cultured marble]], but wood or natural stone is used for higher-end kitchens and stainless steel are used for commercial or lower-end kitchens.
* Large sink
* Cabinets
* Refrigerator and freezer: Especially in smaller kitchens for apartments, the top is usually low enough to use as an additional surface, particularly for appliances, similar to Western dormitory-sized refrigerator/freezers. In larger kitchens, full height refrigerators are common.
* Gas or [[induction cooking|induction]] stove: In smaller kitchens, there are only one or two burners, while more often it is three to four burners, with a narrow grill underneath for fish or vegetables. In the low-end apartments, stoves are often not built-in but rather a counter-top appliance, which is attached with a hose to a gas or power outlet. In case of earthquakes, the gas tap is to be turned off to prevent fires.
* Electric [[rice cooker]]: Over 95% of Japanese houses have one.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
* [[Electric water boiler]] or [[kettle]], particularly for making tea, but also [[instant ramen]]
* [[Toaster oven]]
* [[Microwave oven]] or [[convection microwave]]
* [[Extractor hood]] or fan

Notably absent are a large oven and [[dishwasher]]. Large gas ovens are found in some kitchens, particularly in the higher-end dwellings, but in the most kitchens, convection microwave are used instead. Dishwashers can be found in the kitchens for house and condominium, but rarely found in the apartments.

Portable [[vacuum flask]]s are popular for carrying home-brewed tea, particularly hot tea in the winter and cold tea in the summer, particularly cold [[oolong tea]].

'''Johnson–Nyquist noise''' ('''thermal noise''', '''Johnson noise''', or '''Nyquist noise''') is the [[electronic noise]] generated by the thermal agitation of the charge carriers (usually the [[electron]]s) inside an [[electrical conductor]] at equilibrium, which happens regardless of any applied [[voltage]].  Thermal noise is present in all [[electrical circuit]]s, and in sensitive electronic equipment such as [[radio receiver]]s can drown out weak signals, and can be the limiting factor on sensitivity of an electrical measuring instrument.  Thermal noise increases with temperature.  Some sensitive electronic equipment such as [[radio telescope]] receivers are cooled to [[cryogenic]] temperatures to reduce thermal noise in their circuits.   The generic, statistical physical derivation of this noise is called the [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]], where generalized [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] or generalized [[Electric susceptibility|susceptibility]] is used to characterize the medium.

Thermal noise in an ideal resistor is approximately [[white noise|white]], meaning that the power [[spectral density]] is nearly constant throughout the [[frequency spectrum]] (however see the section below on extremely high frequencies).  When limited to a finite bandwidth, thermal noise has a nearly [[Normal distribution|Gaussian amplitude distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John R. Barry |author2=Edward A.

== History ==
This type of noise was discovered and first measured by [[John Bertrand Johnson|John B. Johnson]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://prola.aps.org/pdf/PR/v29/i2/p350_1|department=Proceedings of the American Physical Society: Minutes of the Philadelphia Meeting December 28, 29, 30, 1926|journal=Phys.

== Noise voltage and power ==
Thermal noise is distinct from [[shot noise]], which consists of additional current fluctuations that occur when a voltage is applied and a macroscopic current starts to flow. For the general case, the above definition applies to charge carriers in any type of conducting [[Transmission medium|medium]] (e.g. [[ion]]s in an [[electrolyte]]), not just [[resistor]]s. It can be modeled by a voltage source representing the noise of the [[non-ideal resistor]] in series with an [[ideal noise free resistor]].

The one-sided [[Spectral density|power spectral density]], or voltage variance (mean square) per [[hertz]] of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline {v_{n}^2} = 4 k_\text{B} T R
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]] in [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]], ''T'' is the resistor's absolute [[temperature]] in kelvins, and ''R'' is the resistor value in [[ohm]]s (Ω).
Use this equation for quick calculation, at room temperature:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{\overline {v_{n}^2}} = 0.13 \sqrt{R} ~\mathrm{nV}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a 1&amp;nbsp;kΩ resistor at a temperature of 300&amp;nbsp;K has

:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{\overline {v_{n}^2}} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 1.38 \cdot 10^{-23}~\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{K} \cdot 300~\mathrm{K} \cdot 1~\mathrm{k}\Omega} = 4.07  ~\mathrm{nV}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a given bandwidth,  the [[root mean square]] (RMS) of the voltage, &lt;math&gt;v_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
v_{n}  = \sqrt{\overline {v_{n}^2}}\sqrt{\Delta f } = \sqrt{ 4 k_\text{B} T R \Delta f }
&lt;/math&gt;

where Δ''f'' is the bandwidth in hertz over which the noise is measured. For a 1&amp;nbsp;kΩ resistor at room temperature and a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth, the RMS noise voltage is 400&amp;nbsp;nV.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=sqrt(4*k*295+Kelvin*1+kiloOhm*(10+kHz))+in+nanovolt Google Calculator result] for 1&amp;nbsp;kΩ room temperature 10&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth&lt;/ref&gt; A useful rule of thumb to remember is that 50&amp;nbsp;Ω at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz bandwidth correspond to 1&amp;nbsp;nV noise at room temperature.

A resistor in a short circuit dissipates a noise power of
:&lt;math&gt;
P = {v_{n}^2}/R = 4 k_\text{B} \,T \Delta f.
&lt;/math&gt;

The noise generated at the resistor can transfer to the remaining circuit; the maximum noise power transfer happens with [[impedance matching]] when the [[Thévenin equivalent]] resistance of the remaining circuit is equal to the noise generating resistance. In this case each one of the two participating resistors dissipates noise in both itself and in the other resistor. Since only half of the source voltage drops across any one of these resistors, the resulting noise power is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
P = k_\text{B} \,T \Delta f
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the thermal noise power in watts. Notice that this is independent of the noise generating resistance.

== Noise current ==
The noise source can also be modeled by a current source in parallel with the resistor by taking the [[Norton equivalent]] that corresponds simply to dividing by ''R''. This gives the [[root mean square]] value of the current source as:

:&lt;math&gt;
i_n = \sqrt {{4 k_\text{B} T \Delta f } \over R}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thermal noise is intrinsic to all resistors and is not a sign of poor design or manufacture, although resistors may also have excess noise.

== Noise power in decibels ==
Signal power is often measured in [[dBm]] ([[decibels]] relative to 1 [[milliwatt]]). From the equation above, noise power in a resistor at [[room temperature]], in dBm, is then:
:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{dBm} = 10\ \log_{10}(k_\text{B} T \Delta f \times 1000)&lt;/math&gt;
where the factor of 1000 is present because the power is given in milliwatts, rather than watts. This equation can be simplified by separating the constant parts from the bandwidth:
:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{dBm} = 10\ \log_{10}(k_\text{B} T \times 1000) + 10\ \log_{10}(\Delta f)&lt;/math&gt;
which is more commonly seen approximated for room temperature (T = 300 K) as:
:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{dBm} = -174 + 10\ \log_{10}(\Delta f)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; is given in Hz; e.g., for a noise bandwidth of 40&amp;nbsp;MHz, &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; is 40,000,000.

Using this equation, noise power for different bandwidths is simple to calculate:

== Thermal noise on capacitors ==
Thermal noise on capacitors is referred to as ''kTC'' noise. Thermal noise in an [[RC circuit]] has an unusually simple expression, as the value of the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] (''R'') drops out of the equation. This is because higher ''R'' contributes to more filtering as well as to more noise.  The noise bandwidth of the RC circuit is 1/(4''RC''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kent H.|last=Lundberg|page=10|url=http://web.mit.edu/klund/www/papers/UNP_noise.pdf|title=Noise Sources in Bulk CMOS}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can substituted into the above formula to eliminate ''R''.  The mean-square and RMS noise voltage generated in such a filter are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=R.|last1=Sarpeshkar|first2=T.|last2=Delbruck|first3=C. A.|last3=Mead|doi=10.1109/101.261888|title=White noise in MOS transistors and resistors|journal=IEEE Circuits Devices Mag|pages=23-29|date=November 1993|url=http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~phasler/Courses/ECE6414/Unit1/Rahul_noise01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline {v_{n}^2} = k_\text{B} T / C
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v_{n} = \sqrt{ k_\text{B} T / C }.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thermal noise in the resistor accounts for 100% of ''kTC'' noise.

In the extreme case of the ''reset noise'' left on a capacitor by opening an ideal switch, the resistance is infinite, yet the formula still applies; however, now the RMS must be interpreted not as a time average, but as an average over many such reset events, since the voltage is constant when the bandwidth is zero.  In this sense, the Johnson noise of an RC circuit can be seen to be inherent, an effect of the thermodynamic distribution of the number of electrons on the capacitor, even without the involvement of a resistor.

The noise is not caused by the capacitor itself, but by the thermodynamic fluctuations of the amount of charge on the capacitor.  Once the capacitor is disconnected from a conducting circuit, the thermodynamic fluctuation is ''frozen'' at a random value with [[standard deviation]] as given above.

The reset noise of capacitive sensors is often a limiting noise source, for example in [[image sensor]]s.  As an alternative to the voltage noise, the reset noise on the capacitor can also be quantified as the [[electrical charge]] standard deviation, as

:&lt;math&gt;
Q_{n} = \sqrt{ k_\text{B} T C }.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the charge variance is &lt;math&gt;k_\text{B} T C&lt;/math&gt;, this noise is often called ''kTC noise''.

Any system in [[thermal equilibrium]] has [[state variable]]s with a mean [[energy]] of ''kT''/2 per [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]]. Using the formula for energy on a capacitor (''E''&amp;nbsp;= ½''CV''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), mean noise energy on a capacitor can be seen to also be ½''C''(''kT''/''C''), or also ''kT''/2.  Thermal noise on a capacitor can be derived from this relationship, without consideration of resistance.

The ''kTC'' noise is the dominant noise source at small capacitors.

== Generalized forms ==
The &lt;math&gt;4 k_\text{B} T R&lt;/math&gt; voltage noise described above is a special case for a purely resistive component for low frequencies.
In general, the thermal electrical noise continues to be related to resistive response in many more generalized electrical cases, as a consequence of the [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]]. Below a variety of generalizations are noted.
All of these generalizations share a common limitation, that they only apply in cases where the electrical component under consideration is purely [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] and linear.

=== Reactive impedances ===
Nyquist's original paper also provided the generalized noise for components having partly [[electrical reactance|reactive]] response, e.g., sources that contain capacitors or inductors.&lt;ref name=Nyquist/&gt; Such a component can be described by a frequency-dependent complex [[electrical impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z(f)&lt;/math&gt;. The formula for the [[power spectral density]] of the series noise voltage is
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{v_n v_n}(f) = 4 k_\text{B} T \eta(f) \operatorname{Re}[Z(f)].
&lt;/math&gt;
The function &lt;math&gt;\eta(f)&lt;/math&gt; is simply equal to 1 except at very high frequencies, or near absolute zero (see below).

The real part of impedance, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}[Z(f)]&lt;/math&gt;, is in general frequency dependent and so the Johnson–Nyquist noise is not white noise.
The rms noise voltage over a span of frequencies &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; can be found by integration of the power spectral density:
:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\langle v_n^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\int_{f_1}^{f_2} S_{v_n v_n}(f) df}&lt;/math&gt;.

Alternatively, a parallel noise current can be used to describe Johnson noise, its [[power spectral density]] being
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{i_n i_n}(f) = 4 k_\text{B} T \eta(f) \operatorname{Re}[Y(f)].
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Y(f) = 1/Z(f)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electrical admittance]]; note that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}[Y(f)] = \operatorname{Re}[Z(f)]/|Z(f)|^2&lt;/math&gt;

=== Quantum effects at high frequencies or low temperatures ===
Nyquist also pointed out that quantum effects occur for very high frequencies or very low temperatures near absolute zero.&lt;ref name=Nyquist/&gt; The function &lt;math&gt;\eta(f)&lt;/math&gt; is in general given by
:&lt;math&gt;\eta(f) = \frac{hf/k_\text{B} T}{e^{hf/k_\text{B} T} - 1},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]].

At very high frequencies &lt;math&gt;f \gtrsim k_\text{B} T/h&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;\eta(f)&lt;/math&gt; starts to exponentially decrease to zero. At room temperature this transition occurs in the terahertz, far beyond the capabilities of conventional electronics, and so it is valid to set &lt;math&gt;\eta(f)=1&lt;/math&gt; for conventional electronics work.

==== Relation to Planck's law ====
Nyquist's formula is essentially the same as that derived by Planck in 1901 for electromagnetic radiation of a blackbody in one dimension—i.e., it is the one-dimensional version of [[Planck's law|Planck's law of blackbody radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Microwave Photonics |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mg91BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |first1=V. J.|last1=Urick|first2=Keith J.|last2=Williams|first3=Jason D.|last3=McKinney}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a hot resistor will create electromagnetic waves on a [[transmission line]] just as a hot object will create electromagnetic waves in free space.

In 1946, [[Robert H. Dicke|Dicke]] elaborated on the relationship,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1063/1.1770483| volume = 17| issue = 7| pages = 268–275| last = Dicke| first = R. H.| title = The Measurement of Thermal Radiation at Microwave Frequencies| journal = Review of Scientific Instruments| date = 1946-07-01| pmid=20991753| bibcode = 1946RScI...17..268D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further connected it to properties of antennas, particularly the fact that the average [[antenna aperture]] over all different directions cannot be larger than &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2/(4\pi)&lt;/math&gt;, where λ is wavelength. This comes from the different frequency dependence of 3D versus 1D Planck's law.

=== Multiport electrical networks ===
[[Richard Q. Twiss]] extended Nyquist's formulas to multi-[[Port (circuit theory)|port]] passive electrical networks, including non-reciprocal devices such as [[circulator]]s and [[Isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1722048| title = Nyquist's and Thevenin's Theorems Generalized for Nonreciprocal Linear Networks| journal = Journal of Applied Physics| volume = 26| issue = 5| pages = 599| year = 1955| last1 = Twiss | first1 = R. Q.| bibcode = 1955JAP....26..599T}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thermal noise appears at every port, and can be described as random series voltage sources in series with each port. The random voltages at different ports may be correlated, and their amplitudes and correlations are fully described by a set of [[cross-spectral density]] functions relating the different noise voltages,
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{v_m v_n}(f) = 2 k_\text{B} T \eta(f) (Z_{mn}(f) + Z_{nm}(f)^*)
&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;Z_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; are the elements of the [[impedance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.
Again, an alternative description of the noise is instead in terms of parallel current sources applied at each port. Their cross-spectral density is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{i_m i_n}(f) = 2 k_\text{B} T \eta(f) (Y_{mn}(f) + Y_{nm}(f)^*)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{Z}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Admittance parameters|admittance matrix]].

=== Continuous electrodynamic media ===
&lt;!--
TODO in this section:
Mention foundational work by Kubo, Rytov
Mention applications such as generalized electrodynamic thermal transfer (nearfield, etc.)
Someone should write [[fluctuation electrodynamics]].
--&gt;
The full generalization of Nyquist noise is found in [[fluctuation electrodynamics]], which describes the noise [[current density]] inside continuous media with dissipative response in a continuous response function such as [[dielectric permittivity]] or [[magnetic permeability]].
The equations of fluctuation electrodynamics provide a common framework for describing both Johnson–Nyquist noise and free space [[blackbody radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Lake Champlain Seaway''' was a [[canal]] project proposed in the late 19th century and considered as late as the 1960s to connect [[New York State]]'s [[Hudson River]] and [[Quebec]]'s [[St. Lawrence River]] with a deep-water canal. The objective was to allow easy ship traffic from [[New York City]] to [[Montreal]] through Lake Champlain, lowering transportation costs between the two cities.&lt;ref name="seaway"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1936/04/15/archives/champlain-route-studied-as-seaway-13-upstate-and-canada-commerce.html?scp=1 "Champlain route studied as seaway"], ''The New York Times''. April 15, 1936. Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though supported by business groups in New York and Quebec, it proved economically unfeasible. Prohibitive costs (estimated at $100 million in 1900),&lt;ref name="seaway"/&gt; opposition from railroads,&lt;ref&gt;Special to the New York Times. [https://www.nytimes.com/1936/11/27/archives/rail-men-oppose-hudson-waterway-canadian-line-officials-say-present.html?scp=5 "Rail men oppose Hudson waterway"], ''The New York Times''. November 27, 1936. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and the diminishing utility of canal transportation prevented the project from advancing beyond the early planning stages. The [[Great Depression]] cut the project's planning budget, while [[World War II]] and completion of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] delayed matters. The growth of road and air transportation reduced the need for a canal, but the project was still under serious consideration as late as 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Special to the New York Times.

Page 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

As proposed, ships would have used a dredged channel in the Hudson River, transferred to an upgraded [[Champlain Canal]], navigated Lake Champlain, traversed an upgraded [[Chambly Canal]] and St Ours Canal, and traveled a dredged route up the [[Richelieu River]] to Montreal.&lt;ref name="seaway"/&gt; Today, the seaway's planned route is covered by the [[Lakes to Locks Passage]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25379">[[File:Lightning detector.jpg|right|thumb|Lightning detector at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.]]
A '''lightning detector''' is a device that detects lightning produced by [[thunderstorm]]s. There are three primary types of detectors: ''ground-based'' systems using multiple antennas, ''mobile systems'' using a direction and a sense antenna in the same location (often aboard an aircraft), and ''space-based systems''.

The first such device was invented in 1894 by [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov]]. It also was the first [[Receiver (radio)|radio receiver]] in the world.

Ground-based and mobile detectors calculate the direction and severity of [[lightning]] from the current location using [[radio direction-finding]] techniques along with an analysis of the characteristic frequencies emitted by lightning. Ground-based systems use [[triangulation]] from multiple locations to determine distance, while mobile systems estimate distance using signal frequency and [[attenuation]]. Space-based detectors on [[satellite]]s can be used to locate lightning range, bearing and intensity by direct observation.

Ground-based lightning detector networks are used by meteorological services like the [[National Weather Service]] in the [[United States]], the [[Meteorological Service of Canada]], the [[European Cooperation for Lightning Detection]], the Institute for Ubiquitous Meteorology ([[Ubimet]]) and by other organizations like electrical utilities and forest fire prevention services.

== Limitations ==
Each system used for lightning detection has its own limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightningsafety.com/nlsi_lhm/overview2002.html|title=An Overview of Lightning Detection Equipment|author= Richard Kithil|publisher=National Lightning Safety Institute |date=2006|accessdate=2006-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

* A ground-based lightning network must be able to detect a flash with at least three antennas to locate it with an acceptable margin of error. This often leads to the rejection of cloud-to-cloud lightning, as one antenna might detect the position of the flash on the starting cloud and the other antenna the receiving one.   As a result, ground-based networks have a tendency to underestimate the number of flashes, especially at the beginning of storms where cloud-to-cloud lightning is prevalent.
* Since they use attenuation rather than triangulation, mobile detectors sometimes mistakenly indicate a weak lightning flash nearby as a strong one further away, or vice versa.
* Space-based lightning networks suffer from neither of these limitations, but the information provided by them is often several minutes old by the time it is widely available, making it of limited use for real-time applications such as air navigation.

== Lightning detectors vs. weather radar ==
[[File:Orage ordinaire.PNG|thumb|300px|right|A thunderstorm life cycle and associated [[reflectivity|reflectivities]] from a weather radar]]
[[File:Diagramme foudre.png|thumb|300px|right|Distribution of electric charges and lightning strikes in and around a thunderstorm]]
Lightning detectors and [[weather radar]] work together to detect storms. Lightning detectors indicate electrical activity, while weather radar indicates precipitation. Both phenomena are associated with thunderstorms and can help indicate storm strength.

The first image on the right shows the [[Thunderstorm#Life cycle|life cycle of a thunderstorm]]:

* Air is moving upward due to instability.
* Condensation occurs and radar detects echoes above the ground (colored areas).
* Eventually the mass of rain drops is too large to be sustained by the updraft and they fall toward the ground.

The cloud must develop to a certain vertical extent before lightning is produced, so generally weather radar will indicate a developing storm before a lightning detector does. It is not always clear from early returns if a shower cloud will develop into a thunderstorm, and weather radar also sometimes suffers from a ''masking'' effect by [[weather radar#Attenuation|attenuation]], where precipitation close to the radar can hide (perhaps more intense) precipitation further away. Lightning detectors do not suffer from a masking effect and can provide confirmation when a shower cloud has evolved into a thunderstorm.

Lightning may be also located outside the precipitation recorded by radar. The second image shows that this happens when strikes originate in the anvil of the thundercloud (top part blown ahead of the [[cumulonimbus cloud]] by upper winds) or on the outside edge of the rain shaft. In both cases, there is still an area of radar echoes somewhere nearby.

== Aviation use ==
Large airliners are more likely to use weather radar than lightning detectors, since weather radar can detect smaller storms that also cause turbulence; however, modern avionics systems often include lightning detection as well, for additional safety.

For smaller aircraft, especially in [[general aviation]], there are two main brands of lightning detectors (often referred to as [[sferics]], short for [[radio atmospherics]]): ''Stormscope'', produced originally by Ryan (later B.F. Goodrich) and currently by L-3 Communications, and the ''Strikefinder'', produced by Insight.  ''Strikefinder'' can detect and properly display IC (intracloud) and CG (cloud to ground) strikes as well as being able to differentiate between real strikes and signal bounces reflected off the Ionosphere. Lightning detectors are inexpensive and lightweight, making them attractive to owners of light aircraft (particularly of single-engine aircraft, where the aircraft nose is not available for installation of a [[radome]]).

== Professional-quality portable lightning detectors ==
[[File:Museu Romàntic Can Papiol. Maig 2014 05.JPG|thumb|Lightning strike counter in a Museum Patio]]
Inexpensive portable lightning detectors as well as other single sensor [[Wiktionary:lightning mapper|lightning mappers]], such as used on aircraft, have limitations including detection of [[Wiktionary:false signal|false signals]] and poor [[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]], particularly for [[Wiktionary:IC lightning|intracloud (IC) lightning]].  Professional-quality portable lightning detectors improve performance in these areas by several techniques which facilitate each other, thus magnifying their effects:

* False signal elimination: A lightning discharge generates both a [[RF signal|radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic signal]] – commonly experienced as "static" on an AM radio – and very short duration light pulses, comprising the visible "flash".  A lightning detector that works by sensing just one of these signals may misinterpret signals coming from sources other than lightning, giving a false alarm.  Specifically, RF-based detectors may misinterpret RF noise, also known as [[Radio frequency interference|RF Interference]] or RFI.  Such signals are generated by many common environmental sources, such as auto ignitions, fluorescent lights, TV sets, light switches, electric motors, and high voltage wires.  Likewise, light-flash-based detectors may misinterpret flickering light generated in the environment, such as reflections from windows, sunlight through tree leaves, passing cars, TV sets, and fluorescent lights.
However, since RF signals and light pulses rarely occur simultaneously except when produced by lightning, RF sensors and light pulse sensors can usefully be connected in a “[[coincidence circuit]]” which requires both kinds of signals simultaneously in order to produce an output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/JZ065i007p01927|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1960/JZ065i007p01927.shtml|title=Electric-Field Changes and the Design of Lightning-Flash Counters|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=1960|volume=65| pages=1927–1930|author1=Brook, M. |author2=N. Kitagawa | issue=7|bibcode=1960JGR....65.1927B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If such a system is pointed toward a cloud and lightning occurs in that cloud, both signals will be received; the coincidence circuit will produce an output; and the user can be sure the cause was lightning.
When a lightning discharge occurs within a cloud at night, the entire cloud appears to illuminate.  In daylight these intracloud flashes are rarely visible to the human eye; nevertheless, optical sensors can detect them.  Looking through the window of the space shuttle in early missions, astronauts used optical sensors to detect lightning in bright sunlit clouds far below.  This application led to development of the dual signal portable lightning detector which utilizes light flashes as well as the “[[Wiktionary:sferics|sferics]]” signals detected by previous devices.

* Improved Sensitivity: In the past, lightning detectors, both inexpensive portable ones for use on the ground and expensive aircraft systems, detected low frequency radiation because at low frequencies the signals generated by [[Wiktionary:CG lightning|cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning]] are stronger (have higher amplitude) and thus are easier to detect.  However, RF noise is also stronger at low frequencies.  To minimize RF noise reception, low-frequency sensors are operated at low sensitivity (signal reception threshold) and thus do not detect less intense lightning signals.  This reduces the ability to detect lightning at longer distances since signal intensity decreases with the square of distance.  It also reduces detection of intracloud (IC) flashes which generally are weaker than CG flashes. 
* Enhanced Intracloud Lightning Detection: The addition of an optical sensor and coincidence circuit not only eliminates false alarms caused by RF noise; it also allows the RF sensor to be operated at higher sensitivity and to sense higher frequencies characteristic of IC lightning and enable the weaker high frequency components of IC signals and more distant flashes to be detected.

The improvements described above significantly extend the detector’s utility in many areas:

* Early warning:  Detection of IC flashes is important because they typically occur from 5 to 30 minutes before CG flashes [source?] and so can provide earlier warning of developing thunderstorms [source?], greatly enhancing the effectiveness of the detector in personal-safety and storm-spotting applications compared to a CG-only detector [source?].  Increased sensitivity also provides warning of already-developed storms which are more distant but may be moving toward the user. [source?]
* Storm location:  Even in daylight, “[[Storm chasing|storm chasers]]” can use directional optical detectors that can be pointed at an individual cloud to distinguish [[thundercloud]]s at a distance.  This is particularly important for identifying the strongest thunderstorms which produce [[tornado]]es, since such storms produce higher flash rates with more high frequency radiation than weaker non-tornadic storms.&lt;ref name="0-19-507337-1"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Electrical Nature of Storms | date=1998 | publisher=Oxford University Press, NY | isbn=0-19-507337-1 |author1=MacGorman, Donald R. |author2=Rust, W. David }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|248}}
* Microburst prediction:  IC flash detection also provides a method for predicting [[microburst]]s.&lt;ref name="0-84-938647-0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams | first=Earle R. |authorlink=Earle R. Williams|editor-first=Hans | editor-last=Volland |title=Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics, Vol. 1 |publisher= CRC Press, Boca Raton |date=1995 |chapter=Meteorological aspects of thunderstorms |isbn=0-8493-8647-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46–47}}  The updraft in convective cells starts to become electrified when it reaches altitudes sufficiently cold so that mixed phase hydrometeors (water and ice particles) can exist in the same volume.  Electrification occurs due to collisions between ice particles and water drops or water coated ice particles.  The lighter ice particles (snow) are charged positively and carried to the upper portion of the cloud leaving behind the negatively charged water drops in the central part of the cloud.&lt;ref name="JD090iD04p06013"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1985/JD090iD04p06013.shtml|title= Large scale charge separation in thunderclouds |last=Williams | first=Earle R. |authorlink=Earle R. Williams|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=1985|volume=90|issue=D4|doi=10.1029/jd090id04p06013 |bibcode=1985JGR....90.6013W |pages=6013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6014}} These two charge centers create an electric field leading to lightning formation.  The updraft continues until all the liquid water is converted to ice, which releases [[latent heat]] driving the updraft.  When all the water is converted, the updraft collapses rapidly as does the lightning rate.  Thus the increase in lightning rate to a large value, mostly due to IC discharges, followed by a rapid dropoff in rate provides a characteristic signal of the collapse of the updraft which carries particles downward in a downburst.  When the ice particles reach warmer temperatures near cloudbase they melt causing atmospheric cooling; likewise, the water drops evaporate, also causing cooling.  This cooling increases air density which is the driving force for microbursts.  The cool air in “gust fronts” often experienced near thunderstorms is caused by this mechanism.
* Storm identification/tracking:  Some thunderstorms, identified by IC detection and observation, make no CG flashes and would not be detected with a CG sensing system.  IC flashes also are many times as frequent &lt;ref name="0-19-507337-1" /&gt;{{rp|192}} as CG so provide a more robust signal.  The relative high density (number per unit area) of IC flashes allows convective cells to be identified when mapping lightning whereas CG lightning are too few and far between to identify cells which typically are about 5&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.  In the late stages of a storm the CG flash activity subsides and the storm may appear to have ended—but generally there still is IC activity going on in the residue mid-altitude and higher cirrus anvil clouds, so the potential for CG lightning still exists.
* Storm intensity quantification:  Another advantage of IC detection is that the flash rate (number per minute) is proportional to the 5th power of the convective velocity of the updrafts in the thundercloud.&lt;ref name="JD090iD04p06013" /&gt;{{rp|6018–6019}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2008JD010370.shtml | title=A fifth-power relationship for lightning activity from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite observations|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=2009|first=Satoru|last=Yoshida|author2=Takeshi Morimoto |author3=Tomoo Ushio  |author4=ZenIchiro Kawasaki |lastauthoramp=yes |volume=114|doi=10.1029/2008jd010370 |bibcode=2009JGRD..114.9104Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-linear response means that a small change in cloud height, hardly observable on radar, would be accompanied by a large change in flash rate.  For example, a hardly noticeable 10% increase in cloud height (a measure of storm severity) would have a 60% change in total flash rate, which is easily observed.   “Total lightning” is both the generally invisible (in daylight) IC flashes that stay within the cloud as well as the generally visible CG flashes that can be seen extending from cloud base to ground.  Because most of the total lightning is from IC flashes, this ability to quantify storm intensity occurs mostly through detection of IC discharges.  Lightning detectors that sense only low frequency energy detect only IC flashes that are nearby, so they are relatively inefficient for predicting microbursts and quantifying convective intensity.

== Lightning range estimation ==
When an RF lightning signal is detected at a single location, one can determine its direction using a [[Wiktionary:crossed loop sensor|crossed-loop magnetic direction finder]] but it is difficult to determine its distance.  Attempts have been made using the amplitude of the signal but this does not work very well because lightning signals greatly vary in their intensity.  Thus, using amplitude for distance estimation, a strong flash may appear to be nearby and a weaker signal from the same flash – or from a weaker flash from the same storm cell – appears to be farther away. One can tell where lightning will strike within a mile radius by measuring ionization in the air to improve the accuracy of the prediction.

To understand this aspect of lightning detection one needs to know that a lightning 'flash' generally consists of several strokes, a typical number of strokes from a CG flash is in the range 3 to 6 but some flashes can have more than 10 strokes.
&lt;ref name='0-12-708350-2'&gt;{{cite book | last = Uman | first = Martin A. | authorlink = Martin A. Uman | title = The Lightning Discharge | publisher = Academic Press, N.Y. | date = 1987 | isbn = 0-12-708350-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}
The initial stroke leaves an ionized path from the cloud to ground and subsequent 'return strokes', separated by an interval of about 50 milliseconds, go up that channel.  The complete discharge sequence is typically about ½ second in duration while the duration of the individual strokes varies greatly between 100 nanoseconds and a few tens of microseconds.  The strokes in a CG flash can be seen at night as a non-periodic sequence of illuminations of the lightning channel.  This can also be heard on sophisticated lightning detectors as individual staccato sounds for each stroke, forming a distinctive pattern.

Single sensor lightning detectors have been used on aircraft and while the lightning direction can be determined from a crossed loop sensor, the distance can not be determined reliably because the signal amplitude varies between the individual strokes described above,
&lt;ref name='0-12-708350-2' /&gt;{{rp|115}}
and these systems use amplitude to estimate distance.  Because the strokes have different amplitudes, these detectors provide a line of dots on the display like spokes on a wheel extending out radially from the hub in the general direction of the lightning source.  The dots are at different distances along the line because the strokes have different intensities.  These characteristic lines of dots in such sensor displays are called “radial spread”.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.seaerospace.com/bfg/wx500pg.pdf|title=WX-500 Stormscope Series II Weather Mapping Sensor User’s Guide|publisher=BF Goodrich Avionics Systems, Inc.|date=1997|pages=4–2, 4–7|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821032724/http://www.seaerospace.com/bfg/wx500pg.pdf|archivedate=2008-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These sensors operate in the very low frequency (VLF) and low frequency (LF) range (below 300&amp;nbsp;kHz) which provides the strongest lightning signals:  those generated by return strokes from the ground.  But unless the sensor is close to the flash they do not pick up the weaker signals from IC discharges which have a significant amount of energy in the high frequency (HF) range (up to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz).

Another issue with VLF lightning receivers is that they pick up reflections from the ionosphere so sometimes can not tell the difference in distance between lightning 100&amp;nbsp;km away and several hundred km away.  At distances of several hundred km the reflected signal (termed the “sky wave”) is stronger than the direct signal (termed the “ground wave”).
&lt;ref name='0-12-287801-9'&gt;{{cite book | last = Golde | first = Rudolf H. | authorlink = Rudolf Heinrich Golde | title = Lightning, Vol. 1 | publisher = Academic Press, N.Y. | date = 1977 | pages = 368 | isbn = 0-12-287801-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Earth-ionosphere waveguide]] traps electromagnetic [[VLF]]- and [[Extremely low frequency|ELF]] waves. Electromagnetic pulses transmitted by lightning strikes propagate within that waveguide. The waveguide is dispersive, which means that their [[group velocity]] depends on frequency. The  difference of the group time delay of a lighting pulse at adjacent frequencies is proportional to the distance between transmitter and receiver. Together with the direction finding method, this allows locating lightning strikes by a single station  up to distances of 10000&amp;nbsp;km from their origin. Moreover, the eigenfrequencies of the Earth-ionospheric waveguide, the [[Schumann resonances]]
at about 7.5&amp;nbsp;Hz, are used to determine the global thunderstorm activity.&lt;ref&gt;Volland, H. (ed): "Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics", CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the difficulty in obtaining distance to lightning with a single sensor, the only current reliable method for positioning lightning is through interconnected networks of spaced sensors covering an area of the Earth’s surface using time-of-arrival differences between the sensors and/or crossed-bearings from different sensors.  Several such national networks currently operating in the U.S. can provide the position of CG flashes but currently cannot reliably detect and position IC flashes.

There are a few small area networks (such as Kennedy Space Center's LDAR network, one of whose sensors is pictured at the top of this article) that have VHF time of arrival systems and can detect and position IC flashes.  These are called [[Wiktionary:lightning mapper|lightning mapper]] ''arrays''.  They typically cover a circle 30–40 miles in diameter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="121880">This is a '''list of home computers''', sorted [[alphanumeric]]ally, which lists all relevant details of their video hardware.

A [[home computer]]  was the description of the second generation of [[desktop computers]], entering the market in 1977 and becoming common during the 1980s. A decade later they were generally replaced by [[IBM PC compatible]] "PCs", although in actuality home computers are also members of the class known as [[personal computers]].

Examples of typical early home computers are the [[TRS-80]], [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400/800]], [[BBC Micro]], the [[ZX Spectrum]], the [[MSX#MSX 1|MSX 1]], the [[Amstrad CPC 464]] and the [[Commodore 64]]. Examples of typical late home computers are [[MSX#MSX 2|MSX 2]] systems, and the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] systems.

Note: in cases of manufacturers who have made both [[Home computer|home]] and [[personal computer]]s, only machines fitting into the ''home'' computer category are listed. Systems in the personal computer category, except for Early Macintosh personal computers, are generally all based on the [[VGA]] standard, and use a video chip known as a [[Graphics processing unit]]. Although very early PCs used one of the much simpler (even compared to most home computer video hardware) video display controller cards, using standards such as the [[IBM Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]], [[Hercules Graphics Card]], [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] and [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] standard). Only after the introduction of the VGA standard could PCs really compete with the home computers of the same era, such as the Amiga and Atari ST, or even with the MSX-2. Also not listed are systems that are typically only gaming systems, like the [[Atari 2600]] and the [[Bally Astrocade]], even though these systems could sometimes be upgraded to resemble a home computer.

[[File:Cpc464.computer.750pix.jpg|thumb|The [[Amstrad CPC|Amstrad CPC 464]] was a typical home computer of the 1980s]]

==The importance of having capable video hardware==
Early home computers all had quite similar hardware, (and software) mostly using the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]], the [[Z80]], or in a few cases the [[Motorola 6809|6809]] microprocessor. They could have only as little as 1 [[kilobyte|KB]] of [[random access memory|RAM]] or as much as 128K, and software wise, they could use a small 4K [[BASIC]] interpreter, or an extended 12K or more BASIC. So the basic systems were quite similar, except for one part of the system, the video display hardware. Some systems proved to be much more successful than others, and careful observers will see that the most successful systems had the most capable video hardware. The reason for that is that the success of the home computer was mostly determined by the kind of [[Video Game|games]] you could play on it.

If you wanted to run a nice video game on a home computer, all the other specifications of the system, such as the CPU, the kind of BASIC, even to a degree how much memory the system had (if had at least 32K or more) did not matter much. What mattered most was what kind of picture could be put on the screen, and how easy or hard it was for a programmer to get enough capabilities out of the video hardware to create the effects necessary for the game.

A case in point is the [[Commodore 64]]. Its microprocessor lacked advanced math functions and was relatively slow. In addition, the built-in BASIC interpreter lacked any sort of graphics commands, as it was the same version that was developed for the older [[Commodore PET]] (a computer without any high resolution graphics capabilities at all). However, these drawbacks were of little consequence, because the C64 had the [[VIC-II]] chip. When accessed by [[machine language]] programs, the graphic capabilities of this chip made it practical to develop arcade-style games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1991/a_history_of_gaming_platforms_the_.php?print=1 History of the C64 as gaming platform]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, specific machine language coding exploiting quirks of the VIC-II chip allowed for special tricks to draw even better pictures out of the VIC-II chip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiostyle.sk/dmagic/gallery/gfxmodes.htm Some of the graphics capabilities of the 1982 VIC-II chip, designed at a time that other systems could only generate much more primitive graphics]&lt;/ref&gt; The comparatively large memory and the audio capabilities of the C64 also lent themselves well toward the production of desirable games.
A negative example was the [[Mattel Aquarius|Aquarius]] by [[Mattel]] which had such incredibly limited video hardware (for the time period) that it was retracted from the market after only four months due to bad sales.

===Video arbitration logic===
One major problem that early computer video hardware had to overcome was the ''video bus arbitration'' problem. The problem was to give the video hardware (VDU) continuous read access to the video RAM, while at the same time the CPU also had to access the same RAM. The obvious solution, using [[Time-division multiplexing|interleaving time slots]] for the VDU and RAM was hard to implement because the logic circuits and video memory chips of the time did not have the switching speed they have now. For higher resolutions the logic and the memory chips were barely fast enough to support reading the display data, let alone for dedicating half the available time for the slow 8-bit CPU. That said, there was one system, the [[Apple II]], that was one of the first to use a feature of the data-bus logic of the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] processor to implement a very early interleaving time slot mechanism to eliminate this problem. The [[BBC Microcomputer]] used 4&amp;nbsp;MHz RAM with a 2&amp;nbsp;MHz 6502 in order to interleave video accesses with CPU accesses.

Most other systems used a much simpler approach, and the [[TRS-80]]'s video logic was so primitive that it simply did not have any bus arbitration at all. The CPU had access to the video memory at all times. Writing to the video RAM simply disabled the video display logic. The result was that the screen often displayed random horizontal black stripes on the screen when there was heavy access to the video RAM, like during a [[video game]].

Most systems avoided the problem by having a [[Device register|status register]] that the CPU could read, and which showed when the CPU could safely write to the video memory. That was possible because a [[composite video]] signal blanks the video output signal during the "[[Blanking (video)|blanking periods]]" of the horizontal and especially the long [[Vertical blanking interval|vertical]] video [[Synchronization|sync]] pulses. So by simply waiting for the next blanking period the stripes could be avoided. This approach did have one disadvantage, it relied on the software not to write to the screen during the non-blanking periods. If the software ignored the status register the stripes would re-appear. Another approach, used by most other machines of the time, was to temporarily stop the CPU using the "WAIT/BUSRQ" ([[Z80]]) "WAIT" ([[Motorola 6809|6809]]) or "SYNC" (6502) control signal whenever the CPU tried to write to the screen during a non-blanking period. Yet another, more advanced, solution was to add a hardware [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] so that the CPU could write to the FIFO instead of directly to the RAM chips, which were updated from the FIFO during a blanking interval by special logic circuitry. Some later systems started using special "two port" video memory, called [[VRAM]], that had independent data output pins for the CPU interface and the video logic.

==The main classes of video hardware==
There are two main categories of solutions for a home computer to generate a video signal:
* A custom design, either built from [[Logic gate|discrete logic]] chips or based around some kind of custom logic chips (an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] or [[programmable logic device|PLD]]).
* A system using some form of [[video display controller]] (VDC), a [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] chip that contained most of the logic circuitry needed to generate the video signal

Systems in the first category were the most flexible, and could offer a wide ranges of (sometimes unique) capabilities, but generally speaking the second category could offer a much more complex system for a comparable lower price.

The VDC based systems can be divided into four sub-categories:
* '''Simple video shift register''' based solutions, have a simple "video shifter chip", and the main CPU doing most of the complex stuff. Only one example of such a chip for a home computer exists, the [[RCA 1802#Video|RCA CDP1861]] used in the [[COSMAC VIP]]. It could only create a very low resolution monochrome graphic screen. The chip in the [[Sinclair ZX-81]] also is a video shifter but is a custom logic chip (a [[Gate array|ULA]]) rather than a single-purpose commercial IC like the CDP1861. Dedicated Video shifter chips did have some use in very early game systems, most notably the [[Television Interface Adapter]] chip in the [[Atari 2600]]. Note that although one of the chips in an [[Atari ST]] is also called a "video shift register" it does not fall into this class, mainly because the IC's in this class depend on the main CPU to feed them with picture data. They do nothing more than generate the sync signals and convert parallel data into a serial video data stream. The Atari ST's chip used a DMA system to read out video data independent of the main CPU, and contained a palette RAM, and resolution/color mode switching logic.
* '''CRTC''' (Cathode Ray Tube Controller) based solutions. A CRTC is a chip that generates most of the basic timing and control signals. It must be complemented with some "Video RAM" and some other logic for the "arbitration", so that the CPU and the CRTC chip can share access to this RAM. To complete the design, a CRTC chip also needs some other support logic. For example, a ROM containing the [[bitmap]] [[font]] for [[text mode]]s, and logic to convert the output from the system into a [[video signal]].
* '''Video interface controllers''' were a step up on the ladder, these were true [[VLSI]] chips that integrated all of the logic that was in a typical CRTC based system, plus a lot more, into a single chip. The [[VIC-II]] chip is probably the best known chip of this category.
* '''Video co-processor''' chips are at the highest end of the scale; Video interface controllers that can manipulate, and/or interpret and display, the contents of their own dedicated Video RAM without intervention from the main CPU.  These chips are highly flexible offering options and features with minimal CPU involvement that on other systems are impossible or at best difficult to produce, requiring extensive CPU overhead.  The Atari [[ANTIC]]/[[CTIA and GTIA|GTIA]] and Amiga [[Amiga Original chipset|OCS]]/[[Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]]/[[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] are well known examples of this high-feature category. But note that not all video co-processors are powerful, some are even simpler than many ''Video interface controllers'', notably the primitive SAA5243 which is still technically a co-processor.

==Explanation of the terms used in the tables==
; System Name : The name of the system, or if there are many similar versions, the name of the most well known variant, see Notes.
; Year : The year that the first version of this system came on the market.
; Chip name : The name of the chip that was used as the basis for the video logic.
; Video RAM : The maximum amount of RAM used for the video display, depending on the resolution used the system may use less.
; Video mode(s) [i.e. [[Text mode]](s) and Graphics modes]: The numbers of characters per line and lines of text the system supported and the number of colors they could have. Sometimes more than one mode was possible: The number of horizontal and Vertical pixels the system could display in a [[high resolution]] mode and The number of colors each pixel could have in High resolution mode, where several high resolution modes exist each one is listed separately. 
; Font extras : Describes extra graphical possibilities a video system had because of optional features of their character sets, there are currently three categories:
; LC : Some systems could only display [[upper case]] characters in text mode because of their limited character set, If a system was able to also support lower case letters in a text mode, (in any highres mode it is of course always possible), then there is '''LC''' (for '''Lower Case''') in this column. 
; BG : Some systems used [[text semigraphics|a matrix of blocky pixels instead of a letter]] in their font sets (or used dedicated hardware to emulate them, like the [[TRS-80]] did), to support some sort of [[all points addressable]] (APA) mode. Its hard to call this a "high resolution" mode, because the resolution could be as low as 80×48 pixels, but in any case you could draw pictures with them. In case of systems that used such a system as its "APA" mode there is '''BG''' (for '''Block Graphics)''' in this column. 
; SG : Some other systems used [[Text semigraphics#Semi graphical characters|semi graphical characters]] like [[box-drawing characters]] dots and [[Suit (cards)|card symbols]], and "graphical building block" [[Geometric Shapes|geometric shapes]]  such as triangles to give the system the appearance it could do high resolution graphics while in reality it could not, Systems like that have '''SG''' (for '''semi graphical characters''') in this column. Many systems like the PET had a few of such characters dedicated to block graphics for an APA mode as well, often only for 2×2 matrix characters. Sometimes the system filled (or could fill) a reprogrammable section of the font set which such characters, these systems mainly fall under the "soft font" heading.  Note that the BG and SG entries are only used when the system relied on them, had them predefined in its default character set, or, (what often happened on early systems) had them printed on the keyboard keys for direct entry in combination with some kind of "graphic shift" key.
; Soft font : When the system had a programmable font RAM instead of a static "[[Read-only memory#Use for storing data|font ROM]]", or when the video system did not have a hardware [[text mode]], but painted text in the highres screen using software, the video display wasn't dependent on a permanent font set, in this case we are talking about a system with a "soft" font.
; Color resolution : in "high resolution mode" it was often the case that a certain pixel could not be given an arbitrary color, often certain clusters of pixels, (quite often 8×8 pixels large) shared the same "color attribute", so as to spare video memory, as an 8-bit computer only had a 64 KB address space, and the CPU often had limited capabilities to manipulate video memory, therefore it was often necessary to keep the video RAM size as small as possible, so a minimum of the address space of the micro was used, and also the video content could be changed relatively rapidly.
; [[List of palettes|Palette support]] : If the system could translate a "logical color" into a (larger number) or true colors using a [[Palette (computing)|palette mechanism]] then this column lists the number of logical colors the palette could accept, and the number of colors it could [[Colour Look Up Table|translate to]].
; HW accel : Short for "[[hardware acceleration]]", can take several forms, the most obvious form is "[[bit blit]]ting", that is the moving of groups of pixels from one place in video memory to another without the CPU doing any of the moving, another often used technique is [[hardware scrolling]] which in fact emulates moving the whole screen in the video ram, a third form of hardware acceleration is the use of sprites implemented in hardware. Some systems also supported drawing lines (and sometimes rectangles) using special line drawing hardware. The entry in the column reveals which methods the hardware supported with a two letters for each method. 
; BL : For [[blitter]]
; DR : For hardware supported [[Bresenham's line algorithm|line drawing]]
; SC : For hardware [[scrolling]] support
; SP : For hardware [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] support
; TE : For hardware [[Tile engine]] support in graphic mode
; Sprite details : Covers three facets of the sprite support hardware the system used. Each number in the table cell is preceded by two letters.
; S# : For the first facet, is the total number of hardware sprites the system could support, in hardware (not counting re-use of the same hardware). if the system doesn't support hardware sprites at all the table cell only contains  "-" . If S# is 1 then the single sprite is most often used to support a [[Pointer (graphical user interfaces)|mouse cursor]].
; SS : For the second facet, is the size of the sprite in screen pixels. A sprite could be displayed by the hardware, as a matrix of horizontal by vertical pixels. If more than one sprite size mode is available each one is listed.
; SC : For the third facet, is the number of sprite colors, it  gives the number of colors that a sprite could have. It is about the total number of colors that could be used to define the sprite (transparent NOT included), so if a sprite could only be displayed as a figure in a single color the number is 1. If more than one sprite size mode is available each one is listed.
; SP : For the fourth facet, is the number of sprites per [[scan line]]. Hardware spites use a kind of [[Z-buffer]] to determine which sprite is "on top". Availability of hardware to do this limits the number of sprites that can be displayed on each scan line. This number tells how many sprites could be displayed on a scanline before one of them became invisible because of hardware limitations.
; Unique features : If the video display has unique features (or limitations) they will be listed here, if space is a limitation the remaining special features are expressed as notes.

''A "'''-'''" in a table cell means that the answer is irrelevant, unknown or in another way has no meaning, for example the sprite size of a system that does not support hardware sprites.''

''A "'''?'''" in a table cell means that the entry has not yet been determined. if a ? follows an entry it means that other options than the listed ones may also exist''

''"'''Mono'''" in a table cell means [[monochrome]] that is for example black on white, or black on green.''

But only 40×24=960 locations in the shift register were actually used.&lt;/ref&gt; || 40×24 Mono 
| colspan="2" |N/A|| &lt;ref&gt;the six bits per character location were only enough to address 64 characters, A Signetics 2513 character generator ROM held only uppercase characters and some other alphanumerical characters in a 5×7 matrix.&lt;/ref&gt; || Dumb terminal&lt;ref&gt;The video display generator of the Apple I was NOT memory-mapped but acted as a (very) [[dumb terminal]]. Data was sent to the terminal through a 7-bit parallel port, and a strobe. Six bits were used to choose which character was displayed next, after the last one on the screen at the "cursor position". The six bits corresponded directly with the character selection bits of the Signetics 2513 character generator ROM. When the seventh (most significant) bit was high, it meant the six least significant bits had to be interpreted as a "command", but only two commands existed. The "carriage return" command made it so that the next character would appear at the start of the next line, and the "clear screen" command which would fill all the video memory with spaces, and reset the cursor position to the top left corner. A "busy" bit could be read from the terminal to determine it was ready to accept a new character. The counters that were used to create the video timing were also used to create the [[RAM refresh]] signal for the 4K main memory. In many ways, the APPLE I's VDU resembles the one of the [[Datapoint 2200]].&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Apple II]] &lt;ref&gt;And the plethora of its clones, see [[List of Apple II clones]]&lt;/ref&gt; || 1977 || 18K&lt;ref&gt;The Apple II has a 1K text buffer for the 40×24 text mode or the 40×48 low resolution graphics mode, and a 8K frame buffer for the 280×192 High resolution graphics mode. But because the Apple had two text and two graphics pages the total reserved memory for video is 18K. The first text/low-resolution page runs from 0400H to 07FFH, the second from 0800H to 0BFFH. The first high-resolution frame buffer runs from 2000H to 3FFFH and the second one from 4000H to 5FFFH.&lt;/ref&gt; || 40×24&lt;ref&gt;in a 5×7 dot matrix with one pixel on either side of characters and a one dot high space between each line.&lt;/ref&gt; Mono/6 colors&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;There are six colors available in the High-Resolution Graphics mode: black, white, orange, blue, green and violet. Each dot can be black, white or a color, although not all colors are available for every dot. If a pixel would be 0 then the corresponding pixel would become black, if it was 1, it would become either white, or a color. Which color a pixel in a 7 pixel "line" of dots would become was determined both by the eighth bit of the pixel data byte, but also by its bit location in the byte. If the bit was in the leftmost column on the screen, or in any even-numbered column, then it would appear violet. If the bit was in the rightmost pixel column, or any odd numbered column, it would become green, except when two even and odd pixels were on alongside each other, then both pixels would be white. All this is true for all seven pixels of a display byte where its eighth bit would be 0 (off), if this bit was turned "on" (to 1), then the violet and green would be exchanged by blue and orange, except in revision 0 board, which could only display 4 colors, black, white, green and violet, because the eighth bit of the display byte had no effect&lt;/ref&gt; 
|Full: 280×192&lt;ref&gt;The Apple only displayed 7 pixels of each byte of the frame buffer, the eighth one was used to determine which color combinations the pixels of the other seven bits could have&lt;/ref&gt; Mono/6 colors&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;Semi: 40×48&lt;ref&gt;exchanging the character set for blocks of 1x2 pixels&lt;/ref&gt; 15 colors&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;each byte of text mode RAM was divided in two nibbles. The "lower" nibble determined the color of the top block, the upper nibble determined the color of the lower block. The sixteen available bit combinations produced fifteen unique colors as the two grays were identical in shade; the colors were, according to official documentation: black, magenta, dark blue, purple, dark green, grey 1, medium blue, light blue, brown, orange, grey 2, pink, light green, yellow, aquamarine, white&lt;/ref&gt;
| 40x48, 140×192&lt;ref&gt;half the pixel resolution&lt;/ref&gt; || &lt;ref&gt;Characters could also be inverted or blinking, The arrangement was not completely ASCII compatible! Characters from 00H to 3FH were inverted, from 40H to 7FH were flashing, from 80H to BFH the normal set. Later models added first lowercase and then also line-drawing characters from C0 to DFH, so that all 256 combinations were used.&lt;/ref&gt;|| 4 line "caption"&lt;ref name="caption"&gt;In high or low resolution graphics mode the Apple could replace the bottom 32 display lines with a four line text "caption", so you could simultaneously display text and graphics.&lt;/ref&gt;

|Scroll RAM&lt;ref&gt;with a resolution of 720 by 256. Even with one bit per pixel, the PCW's video buffer occupied 23 K of RAM, making software scrolling far too slow for fluid text manipulation. In order to improve this, the PCW implemented [[Indirection|roller RAM]], with a 512-byte area of RAM used to hold the address of each line of display data, effectively allowing very rapid scrolling. The video system also fetched data in a special order designed so that plotting a character eight scan lines high would touch eight contiguous addresses. This meant that very fast Z80 copy instructions like LDIR could be used. Unfortunately, it meant that drawing lines and other shapes could be very complicated.&lt;/ref&gt;

This mode is computationally intensive however, and is only suitable for viewing graphics or in paint programs.
* 320×200 pixels with 15 colors per palette, plus a "fill mode" color. In this mode, color 0 in the palette is replaced by the last non-zero color pixel displayed on the scan line (to the left), allowing fast solid-fill graphics (drawn with only the outlines).
* 640×200 pixels with four pure colors. This mode is generally only used for ensuring that the Apple logo and menu bar retain their colors in Desktop applications.
* 640×200 pixels with 16 dithered colors. In this mode, two palettes of four pure colors each are used in alternating columns. The hardware then dithers the colors of adjacent pixels to create 16 total colors on the screen.

|color limitations&lt;ref&gt;The Sinclair Spectrum high-resolution screen has serious color limitations. Each 8×8 pixel block can have only one set of foreground and background colors. This is because of the separate 768-byte color table, (one byte for each 8×8 pixel block). In each of these bytes, the lower three bits (0–2) are the background color, the next three higher bits (3–5) are the foreground color and the two remaining high-order bits were used for a "bright" (6th) and a "blinking" (7th) bit, so one could say the Sinclair had 16 colors, eight with low brightness, and eight with high brightness. The color limitations of this design can cause some heavy [[Attribute clash|attribute clashes]], for which the Spectrum is indeed infamous.

In TRS-80 mode it used 1K (16 lines of 64 characters) and used all 8 bits of the character to support a full set of 256 characters, and in CP/M compatible mode it used 2000 bytes (25 lines of 80 characters) of a dedicated 2K memory, using the same character-set as the TRS-80 mode&lt;/ref&gt; || 64×16, 32×16, 80×25 or 40×25 Mono

The 40×25 mode was initiated when the system was booted with a special [[Videotex]] [[Computer terminal|terminal]] emulator program. In both modes a hardware "de-snowing" (Video memory arbitration system) system was employed that removed the bothersome "snow" that appeared on a TRS-80 screen whenever the system made a large amount of accesses to the video memory. The memory arbitration logic did not need software support, so it also worked with all existing software&lt;/ref&gt; 3 gray scales&lt;ref&gt;Actually, the Aster could display the TRS-80 graphics in black (pixel off), white (pixel on) and one grayscale halfway in-between black and white, which was accomplished by [[Dither|dithering]] the pixels in the semi-graphics block with a checkerboard pattern&lt;/ref&gt;

| Dual memory map support&lt;ref&gt;The Aster system could switch "on the fly" between two completely different system architectures, and also switched its video logic and memory map accordingly, it also lowered the dot clock (crystal) in CP/M mode, so the 64×16 and 80×25 screens were equally wide&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Camputers Lynx]] || 1983 || 32K&lt;ref&gt;Or less when one or more "display pages" were turned off. The Lynx used a display page for each of the three primary colors. For example when the BASIC instruction TEXT was executed the Lynx turned off the display panes for red and blue, so it could reclaim ⅔ of the memory for the display for bigger programs (with all planes on the Lynx had just 16K left for programs) and this also increased the speed of the system because the VDU did not prohibit the CPU access to the memory so often&lt;/ref&gt; || 40×24&lt;ref name="softtext" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Lynx used a trick, the natural resolution of 256 pixels would have called for a display of only 32×24, but by only using 6 pixels wide characters the Lynx could fit in 40 per line, only a very large software overhead was needed, so the display was slow, so slow in fact that the software did not scroll a text screen but simply started on the top line again&lt;/ref&gt; 8 colors

Also, of the 48K a standard Lynx 48 had a full 32K were used for video, leaving only a meager 16K for application software. Compared to the Sinclair Spectrum that also had 48K, but used only 8K for video and had 40K left, 16K was often not enough. The Lynx could disable one or two of its three bit-planes, but this severely limited the color palette.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plus the fact that the X1's [[VRAM]] was not memory mapped, but used the Z80 unique extended I/O mapping, where normally the [[Intel 8080|i8080]] had just 256 I/O locations, the Z80 supported 16-bit I/O addressing, so the "I/O map" could cover 64K.

But only the 5K that points to internal RAM can be used by it on the VIC-20 (even with a RAM expansion module plugged in) without a hardware modification, and the unexpanded VIC-20 only had a grand total of 5K of which only 512 bytes was reserved for the screen; character shape data was 2K but normally came from ROM, not RAM. Color memory is nibble memory (4 bits per location) that is separate from normal RAM, because both have to be accessed at the same time.&lt;/ref&gt; || 22×23&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;8×8 characters, the VIC also supported 8×16 characters; up to 31x29 possible on NTSC machines or up to 32x35 possible on PAL machines&lt;/ref&gt; 16 colors (upper 8 unusable as foreground) 
|Technically full: 160×160  16 colors (upper 8 unusable as foreground) (or more in special cases)&lt;ref&gt;The VIC chip did not provide for a direct full-screen, high-resolution graphics mode. It did, however, allow the pixel-by-pixel depictions of the on-screen characters to be redefined (by using a character generator in RAM), and it allowed for double-height characters (8 pixels wide, 16 pixels high). It was possible to get a fully addressable screen, slightly smaller (160 by 160) than normal, by filling the screen with a sequence of 200 different double-height characters, then turning on the pixels selectively inside the RAM-based character definitions. (The 200-character limitation was so that enough bytes would be left over for the screen character grid itself to remain addressable by the VIC chip.) The Super Expander cartridge provided such a mode in BASIC, although it often had to move the BASIC program around in memory to do it. It was also possible to fill a larger area of the screen with addressable graphics using a more dynamic allocation scheme, if the contents were sparse or repetitive enough.&lt;/ref&gt; or limited 176×184&lt;ref&gt;176×184 is the standard for the VIC-20 firmware, although up to 248×232p/464i is possible on an NTSC machine and 256x280 is possible on a PAL machine.&lt;/ref&gt; 16 colors (upper 8 unusable as foreground)

The tiles can then be manipulated quickly through the [[character pointer table]]. Sprites could be used too in this mode, and all 16 colors could be displayed at the same time. Another use is to have four identical character-sets with each 64 characters in them but with different colors. with this character set it is possible to create a 32×24 text mode that can display texts with four different foreground and background colors at the same time, on the same screen. In 256×192 graphics mode there is a 2-color limitation for each 8 pixel wide line inside a character, so this can cause some [[attribute clash]] although not as severe as on the [[ZX Spectrum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PuertollanoTermicaEncasur.jpg|thumb|[[Cooling tower]], [[Puertollano]], Spain]]
This page is a '''list of [[hyperboloid structure]]s'''. These were first applied in [[architecture]] by Russian engineer [[Vladimir Shukhov]] (1853–1939). Shukhov built his first example as a water tower ([[hyperboloid|hyperbolic]] [[Thin-shell structure|shell]]) for the 1896 [[All-Russia exhibition 1896|All-Russian Exposition]]. Subsequently, more have been designed by other architects, including [[Le Corbusier]], [[Antoni Gaudí]], [[Eduardo Torroja]], [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[I. M. Pei|Ieoh Ming Pei]].

The shapes are [[doubly ruled surface]]s, which can be classed as:
* [[Hyperbolic paraboloid]]s, such as [[saddle roof]]s
* [[Hyperboloid of one sheet]], such as [[cooling tower]]s

&lt;gallery&gt;
 Image:Ruled hyperboloid.jpg|A [[hyperboloid]] of one sheet is a [[doubly ruled surface]], and it may be generated by either of two families of straight lines.
 Image:Hyperbolic-paraboloid.jpg|The [[hyperbolic paraboloid]] is a [[doubly ruled surface]] so it may be used to construct a [[saddle roof]] from straight beams.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[computer engineering]] a '''load–store unit''' is a specialized [[execution unit]] responsible for executing all load and store instructions, generating virtual addresses of load and store operations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271706612_IBM_POWER8_processor_core_microarchitecture|title=IBM POWER8 processor core microarchitecture (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.utcluj.ro/~baruch/book_ssce/SSCE-SPARC.pdf |format=PDF |title=Structure of Computer Systems |page=320 |website=Users.utcluj.ro |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0360f/CACGAFFH.html|title=ARM Information Center|website=infocenter.arm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and loading data from [[computer memory|memory]] or storing it back to memory from [[register (computing)|register]]s.&lt;ref name=Jacob &gt;''Memory Systems: Cache, DRAM, Disk'' by Bruce Jacob, Spencer Ng, David Wang 2007 {{ISBN|0123797519}} page 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The load–store unit usually includes a queue which acts as a waiting area for memory instructions, and the unit itself operates independently of other processor units.&lt;ref name=Jacob /&gt;

Load–store units may also be used in [[vector processing]], and in such cases the term "load–store vector" may be used.&lt;ref name=Hennessy&gt;''Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach'' by John L. Hennessy, David A. Patterson 2011 {{ISBN|012383872X}} pages 293-295&lt;/ref&gt;

Some load-store units are also capable of executing simple fixed-point and/or integer operations.

The '''Machine Intelligence Research Institute''' ('''MIRI'''), formerly the '''Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence''' ('''SIAI'''), is a [[non-profit organization]] founded in 2000 by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]], originally to accelerate the development of [[artificial intelligence]], but focused since 2005 on identifying and managing the potential risks to humanity that future AI systems could become [[Superintelligence|superintelligent]].  MIRI's work has focused on a [[friendly artificial intelligence|friendly AI]] approach to system design and on predicting the rate of technology development.

==History==
In 2000, [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]], who was mostly [[Autodidacticism|self-educated]] and had been involved in the [[Extropianism|Extropian]] group, founded the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence with funding from Brian and Sabine Atkins; the original purpose of the institute was to accelerate the development of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).&lt;ref name=FLI2015&gt;{{cite news |title=MIRI: Artificial Intelligence: The Danger of Good Intentions - Future of Life Institute |url=https://futureoflife.org/2015/10/11/113/ |work=Future of Life Institute |date=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYER/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waters"/&gt;  Yudkowsky began to be concerned that AI systems developed in the future could become [[Superintelligence|superintelligent]] and pose risks to humanity,&lt;ref name=FLI2015/&gt; and in 2005 the institute moved to Silicon Valley and began to focus on ways to identify and manage those risks; this was at a time when the scientists in the field were largely unconcerned with them but a group known as [[transhumanists]] were expressing concerns.&lt;ref name=NYER&gt;{{cite news |last1=Khatchadourian |first1=Raffi |title=The Doomsday Invention |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom |work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Starting in 2006, the Institute organized the [[Singularity Summit]] to discuss the future of AI including its risks, initially in cooperation with Stanford University and funding from [[Peter Thiel]]; the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' described the first conference as a "Bay Area coming-out party for the tech-inspired philosophy called transhumanism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Abate |first=Tom |date=2006 |title=Smarter than thou? |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/05/12/BUG9IIMG1V197.DTL |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |agency= |location= |access-date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Abate |first=Tom |date=2007 |title=Public meeting will re-examine future of artificial intelligence |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Public-meeting-will-re-examine-future-of-2504766.php |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |agency= |location= |access-date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, its offices were four apartments in downtown Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kaste |first1=Martin |title=The Singularity: Humanity's Last Invention? |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/01/11/132840775/The-Singularity-Humanitys-Last-Invention |work=All Things Considered, NPR |date=January 11, 2011 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2012, the institute sold its name, web domain, and the Singularity Summit to [[Singularity University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Press release: Singularity University Acquires the Singularity Summitt |url=https://singularityu.org/2012/12/09/singularity-university-acquires-the-singularity-summit/ |work=Singularity University |date=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the next month took the name "Machine Intelligence Research Institute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Press release: We are now the "Machine Intelligence Research Institute" (MIRI) - Machine Intelligence Research Institute |url=https://intelligence.org/2013/01/30/we-are-now-the-machine-intelligence-research-institute-miri/ |work=Machine Intelligence Research Institute |date=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 and 2015 public and scientific interest in the risks of AI grew; this shift from something once considered "crackpot" to the mainstream spurred further donations to fund research at MIRI and similar organizations.&lt;ref name="Waters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence]]|last1=Tegmark|first1=Max|date=2017|publisher=[[Anchor Books|Knopf]]|isbn=978-1-101-94659-6|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|327}}

==Research and approach==
[[File:Nate Soares giving a talk at Google.gk.jpg|thumb|Nate Soares presenting an overview of the AI alignment problem at [[Google]].]]

MIRI's approach to identify and manage the risks of AI, led by Yudkowsky, is mostly about how to design [[friendly AI]] - both initial design of AI systems and mechanisms to ensure that evolving AI systems remain friendly.&lt;ref name="Waters"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Waters |first1=Richard |title=Artificial intelligence: machine v man |url=https://www.ft.com/content/abc942cc-5fb3-11e4-8c27-00144feabdc0 |accessdate=27 August 2018 |work=Financial Times |date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/building-robots-with-better-morals-than-humans/385015/|title=Building Robots With Better Morals Than Humans|last=LaFrance|first=Adrienne|date=2015|newspaper=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=12 October 2015|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aima"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Stuart |author1-link=Stuart J.

MIRI researchers advocate early safety work as a precautionary measure, before it is too late.&lt;ref name="Ozy"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sathian |first1=Sanjena |title=The Most Important Philosophers of Our Time Reside in Silicon Valley |url=https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/the-21st-century-philosophers/65230 |website=OZY |publisher=OZY |accessdate=28 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However MIRI researchers have expressed skepticism about the views of [[Singularitarianism|singularity advocates]] like [[Ray Kurzweil]] that [[superintelligence]] is "just around the corner".&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt; MIRI has funded forecasting work through an initiative called AI Impacts, which studies historical instances of discontinuous technological change, and has developed new measures of the relative computational power of humans and computer hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hsu |first=Jeremy |date=2015 |title=Making Sure AI's Rapid Rise Is No Surprise |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/lovesick-cyborg/2015/09/02/making-sure-ais-rapid-rise-is-no-surprise/ |newspaper=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |location= |access-date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7128">[[File:Multimedia over Coax Alliance, MoCA, logo.svg|thumb|Multimedia over Coax Alliance, or MoCA, logo]]

The '''Multimedia over Coax Alliance''' ('''MoCA''') is an international standards consortium publishing specifications for [[Computer network|networking]] over [[coaxial cable]].

There are three versions of the specification currently available, MoCA 1.1,  MoCA 2.0, and MoCA 2.5.

== History ==
MoCA was established in 2004.

MoCA 1.0 was approved in 2006, MoCA 1.1 in April 2010, MoCA 2.0 in June 2010, and MoCA 2.5 in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mocalliance.org/news/prM_160416_MoCA-approved-specification-MoCA-2-5|title=Home Networking Gets a New Performance Standard|last=|first=|date=|website=www.mocalliance.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
The Alliance currently has 45 members including pay TV operators, OEMs, CE manufacturers and IC vendors.&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web |title= MoCA Members  |website= MoCAlliance.org |url= http://www.mocalliance.org/aboutus/ourmembers.php |accessdate=October 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MoCA’s board of directors consists of [[Arris Group|Arris]], [[Broadcom]], [[Comcast]], [[Cox Communications]], [[DirecTV]], [[Echostar]], [[Intel]], [[MaxLinear]] and [[Verizon]].

== Technology ==
Within the scope of the [[Internet protocol suite]], MoCA is a protocol that provides the [[link layer]]. In the 7-layer [[OSI model]], it provides definitions within the [[data link layer]] (layer 2) and the [[physical layer]] (layer 1). [[Digital Living Network Alliance|DLNA]] approved of MoCA as a layer 2 protocol.&lt;ref name="mocafaqs"&gt;[http://www.mocalliance.org/about/faqs.htm MOCA FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MoCA-Timeline-v8-2017.gif|thumb|right|600px|MoCA Technology Timeline]]
=== MoCA 1.1 ===
MoCA 1.1 provides 175 Mbit/s net throughputs (275 Mbit/s PHY rate) and operates in the 500 to 1500&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency range.&lt;ref name="moca4installers.com"&gt;http://moca4installers.com/moca_faqs.php&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MoCA 2.0 ===
MoCA 2.0 offers actual throughputs (MAC rate) up to 1 Gbps. Operating frequency range is 500 to 1650&amp;nbsp;MHz. Packet error rate is 1 packet error in 100 million.&lt;ref name="MoCA 2.0"&gt;{{cite web|title= Introducing MoCA 2.0 |date= June 15, 2010 |work= MoCA website |url= http://www.mocalliance.org/MoCA_2/index.php |accessdate= May 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MoCA 2.0 also offers lower power modes of sleep and standby and is backward interoperable with MoCA 1.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= MoCA FAQs |work= MoCA web site |url= http://www.mocalliance.org/aboutus/faq.php |accessdate= October 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, [[Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers|SCTE]]/ISBE society and MoCA consortium began creating a new "standards operational practice" (SCTE 235) to provide MoCA 2.0 with [[DOCSIS|Docsis]] 3.1 interoperability. Interoperability is necessary because both MoCA 2.0 and Docsis 3.1 may operate in the frequency range above 1 GHz. The standard "addresses the need to prevent degradation or failure of signals due to a shared frequency range above 1 GHz". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mocalliance.org/news/prM_170314-SCTE-ISBE-Standards-MoCA-DOCSIS-3-1-Interoperability|title=SCTE/ISBE Standards, MoCA® Team Up on New Operational Practice for DOCSIS® 3.1-MoCA Interoperability|last=KMCreative|website=www.mocalliance.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scte.org/SCTEDocs/Standards/SCTE%20235%202017.pdf|title=SCTE 235, Operational Practice for the Coexistence of DOCSIS 3.1 Signals and MoCA Signals in the Home Environment|last=|first=|date=|website=Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers Inc.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MoCA 2.5 ===
MoCA 2.5 (introduced April 13, 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mocalliance.org/news/prM_160416_MoCA-approved-specification-MoCA-2-5|title=Home Networking Gets a New Performance Standard|last=KMCreative|website=www.mocalliance.org|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) offers actual data rates up to 2.5 Gbit/s, continues to be backward interoperable with MoCA 2.0 and MoCA 1.1, and adds MoCA protected setup (MPS), Management Proxy, Enhanced Privacy, Network wide Beacon Power, and Bridge detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mocalliance.org/news/prM_160416_MoCA-approved-specification-MoCA-2-5|title=MoCA 2.5 News|work=MoCA web site|accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MoCA Access is intended for multiple dwelling units (MDUs) such as hotels, resorts, hospitals, or educational facilities. It is based on the current MoCA 2.0 standard which is capable of 1 Gbps net throughputs, and MoCA 2.5 which is capable of 2.5 Gbps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mocalliance.org/access/index.htm|title=MoCA Access™|last=KMCreative|website=www.mocalliance.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''nuclear explosive''' is an [[explosive]] device that derives its energy from [[nuclear reaction]]s. Almost all nuclear explosive devices that have been designed and produced are [[nuclear weapon]]s intended for [[warfare]].

Other, non-warfare, applications for nuclear explosives have occasionally been proposed. For example, [[nuclear pulse propulsion]] is a form of [[spacecraft propulsion]] that would use nuclear explosives to provide impulse to a spacecraft. A similar application is the proposal to use nuclear explosives for [[asteroid deflection]]. From 1958 to 1965 the [[United States]] government ran a project to design a nuclear explosive powered nuclear pulse rocket called [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]. Never built, this vessel would use repeated nuclear explosions to propel itself and was considered surprisingly practical. It is thought to be a feasible design for interstellar travel.

[[File:Sedan Plowshare Crater.jpg|thumb|The 1962 [[Sedan (nuclear test)|Sedan nuclear test]] formed a crater 100 m (330 ft) deep with a diameter of about 390 m (1,300 ft), as a means of investigating the possibilities of using [[peaceful nuclear explosions]] for large-scale earth moving.]]
Nuclear explosives were once considered for use in large-scale excavation. A nuclear explosion could be used to create a [[harbor]], or a [[mountain pass]], or possibly large underground cavities for use as storage space. It was thought that detonating a nuclear explosive in oil-rich rock could make it possible to extract more from the deposit, e.g. note the Canadian [[Project Oilsand]]. From 1958 to 1973 the U.S. government exploded 28 nuclear test-shots in a project called the [[Operation Plowshare]]. The purpose of the operation was to use [[peaceful nuclear explosions]] for moving and lifting enormous amounts of earth and rock during construction projects such as building reservoirs. The Soviet Union conducted a much more vigorous program of 122 nuclear tests, some with multiple devices, between 1965 and 1989 under the auspices of Program No. 7 – [[Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy]].

As controlled [[nuclear fusion]] has proven difficult to use as an energy source, an alternate proposal for producing [[fusion power]] has been to detonate nuclear fusion explosives inside very large underground chambers and then using the heat produced, which would be absorbed by a molten salt coolant which would also absorb neutrons.  The 1970s [[PACER (fusion)]] project investigated fusion detonation as a power source.

Failure to meet objectives, along with the realization of the dangers of [[nuclear fallout]] and other residual radioactivity, and with the enactment of various agreements such as the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] and the [[Outer Space Treaty]], has led to the termination of most{{Fact|date=March 2008}} of these programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4684">'''PCI Geomatica''' is a [[remote sensing]] desktop software package for processing [[earth observation]] data, designed by [http://www.pcigeomatics.com '''PCI Geomatics''']. The latest version of the software is Geomatica 2017. Geomatica is aimed primarily at faster data processing and allows users to load satellite and aerial imagery where advanced analysis can be performed. Geomatica has been used by many educational institutions and scientific programs throughout the world to analyze satellite imagery and trends, such as the [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=399487 GlobeSAR Program], a program which was carried out by the [[Canada Centre for Remote Sensing]] in the 1990s.

A very popular edition of Geomatica is known as Freeview, which permits users to load multiple types of satellite images as well as geospatial data that is stored in different formats. The software is available for download over the web, and has registered several thousands of downloads. [http://download.cnet.com/geomatica-freeview/3000-2383_4-10066985.html CNET Download page for Freeview]

==Image processing packages==
Geomatica is one of several software packages available to the educational, commercial, and military users. Other similar packages include [[Erdas Imagine]], [[ENVI (software)|Envi]], and [[SOCET SET|SocetSet]] (or Socet GXP). An independent review of the software and its functionality written by Directions Magazine is included here: http://www.directionsmag.com/articles/product-review-pci146s-geomatica-10/123136. Geomatica has also been compared to Envi and Erdas Imagine as it relates to [[orthorectification]]. http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXVII/congress/4_pdf/283.pdf

==Educational institutions using Geomatica==
Over 2,700 educational institutions worldwide have used Geomatica as part of their Remote Sensing course delivery, some of which are listed here

==Open Geospatial Consortium==
Geomatica includes a web coverage service interface that complies with the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) Interface Standard, which is a key area in which PCI Geomatics has contributed. Remote Sensing data providers distribute data in diverse formats, which makes sharing information across many different platforms challenging. WCS seeks to alleviate some of the data sharing challenges by publishing the geographic information and layers openly over the web.

==Contributions to open standards==
Geomatica adheres to open standards to promote sharing and collaboration of earth observation data. An SDK that makes the PCIDSK file format available to the community is available through the [[GDAL]] website here:

A '''packed lunch''' (also called '''pack lunch''', '''sack lunch''' or '''bag lunch''' in [[North America]], or '''pack up'''{{fact|date=November 2016}} in the [[United Kingdom]], as well as the regional variations: '''packed lunch''' in [[Lancashire]], [[Merseyside]] and [[Yorkshire]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/lancashire/voices2005/game.shtml |title = BBC: Lancashire &gt; Voices &gt; Wordly Wise? |publisher = BBC |date = 31 May 2005 |accessdate= 1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a pack up in [[York]]) is a [[lunch]] prepared at [[home]] and carried to be [[eat]]en elsewhere, such as [[school]], a [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], or at an [[excursion|outing]]. The food is usually wrapped in [[plastic wrap|plastic]], [[aluminum foil]], or [[paper]] and can be carried ("[[wikt:packed|packed]]") in a [[lunch box]], [[paper bag]] (a "[[Bag|sack]]"), or [[plastic bag]]. While packed lunches are usually taken from home by the people who are going to eat them, in [[Mumbai, India]], [[tiffin]] boxes are most often picked up from the home and brought to workplaces later in the day by so-called [[dabbawalla]]s. It is also possible to buy packed lunches from stores in several countries. [[Lunch box]]es made out of [[metal]], [[plastic]] or [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] are now popular with today's youth. Lunch boxes provide a way to take heavier lunches in a sturdier box or bag. It is also [[environmentally friendly]].

In the United States, an informal meeting at work, over lunch, where everyone brings a packed lunch, is a '''brown-bag lunch''' or colloquially a "'''brown bag'''". There are also white and other color bags for seasonal use.

==In politics==
One such brown bag lunch was used as a deliberate rebuff of the [[China|Chinese]] hosts, by the [[United States]] delegation, at peace negotiations in [[Kaesong]] during the [[Korean War]].  The Chinese hosts offered lunch and [[watermelon]] to the U.S. guests, which the U.S. [[delegates]], who considered lunching with one's opposition to be [[Fraternization|fraternizing with the enemy]], rejected in favor of their own packed lunches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chinese at the Negotiating Table: Style and Characteristics|author=Alfred D. Wilhelm, Jr.|year=1995|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=0-7881-2340-8|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="973">A '''peg''' is a unit of [[volume]], typically used to measure amounts of [[liquor]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Equal to 30 [[millilitre|mL]], the terms "large peg" and "small peg" are also  the time of the [[British Raj]], and presumably for the sake of convenience was later standardised to 30 mL.

In India, liquor's [[alcohol content]] is typically 42.8% [[ABV]]. It then follows that a peg of liquor usually contains 12.84 mL of pure alcohol, roughly equal to 1.3 [[alcoholic units]].

Informally, a peg is also understood to be a single [[shot glass|shot]] of any alcoholic drink.

==Etymology==
In England the mine owners would give a drink to miners at the end of the shift to get some relief from cold. Workers would eagerly look forward to it and would call it ‘Precious Evening Glass’ which in short became ‘peg’.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3707">A cosmetic '''primer''' is a cream or lotion applied before another cosmetic to improve coverage and lengthen the amount of time the cosmetic lasts on the face.

==Variations ==
There are different kinds of cosmetic primers such as foundation primer, eyelid primer, lip primer, and mascara primer.

A foundation primer may work like a [[moisturizer]] only different, or it may absorb oil with [[salicylic acid]] or aid in creating a less oily, more matte appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beauty.about.com/od/foundationsconcealers/f/primer.htm What is a Foundation Primer? And Do I Need it?]&lt;/ref&gt; It aids in applying the foundation more evenly and smoothly, and increases the longevity of the foundation. Some contain antioxidants such as [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin C|C]], and [[Vitamin E|E]], or other ingredients such as [[grape seed extract]] and [[green tea extract]]. There are water-based and silicon-based foundation primers. Ingredients may include [[cyclomethicone]] and [[dimethicone]]. Some primers do not contain preservative, oil or fragrance. Some may also have [[sun protection factor]] (SPF). Some foundation primers are tinted to even out or improve skin tone or color. Others give a pearlized finish to make the complexion more light reflective. There are also foundation primers which are mineral-based primers, which contain [[mica]] and [[silica]].

[[Eyelid]] or [[eye shadow]] primers are similar, but made specifically for use near the eyes. An eyelid primer may help even the color of the lid and upper eye area, may reduce oiliness, may add shimmer, or inversely may mattify. Eye primers aid in the smooth application of eye shadow, prevent it from accumulating in eyelid creases, and improve its longevity. 
Eye shadow primers are applied to the eyelid and lower eye area prior to the application of eye shadow. They even out the skin tone of the eyelids hide eyelid veins, and smooth out the skin of the eyelids. Eye shadow primers help with the application of eye shadows. They intensify the color of the eye shadows and keep them from smearing or creasing by reducing the oiliness of the lids. Some eye shadows even state in the instruction sheet, that they are recommended for usage over the eye shadow primer. There is a real difference in the eye shadow color and time of wear when it is used over the primer on bare skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eye Shadow Primer: Things to Know |url=https://glamlipstick.com/eye-shadow-primer-things-to-know.html |date= April 2018 |publisher=GlamLipstick.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of eye shadow primers is not limited to eye shadows. They also work for eye liners and eye shadow bases.    

[[Mascara]] primer is sometimes colorless. It usually thickens and/or lengthens the lashes before the application of mascara for a fuller finished look. It may also help keep mascara from smudging or flaking, and some claim to improve the health of the lashes.

[[Lip]] primers are intended to smooth the lips and help improve the application of [[lipstick]] or [[lip gloss]], although [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliating]] the lips is often recommended before applying. They also are intended to increase the longevity of lip color, and to prevent lipstick from "feathering", that is, smearing past the lip [[vermilion border|vermilion]], and especially from migrating into any fine lines around the lips.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4502">In [[physics]], a '''quantum mirage''' is a peculiar result in [[quantum chaos]]. Every system of quantum [[dynamical billiards]] will exhibit an effect called ''scarring'', where the quantum probability density shows traces of the paths a classical [[billiard ball]] would take. For an elliptical arena, the scarring is particularly pronounced at the foci, as this is the region where many classical trajectories converge.  The scars at the foci are colloquially referred to as the "quantum mirage".

The quantum mirage was first experimentally observed by Hari Manoharan, Christopher Lutz and [[Donald Eigler]] at the [[IBM Research|IBM]] [[Almaden Research Center]] in San Jose, California in 2000. The effect is quite remarkable but in general agreement with prior work on the quantum mechanics of dynamical billiards in elliptical arenas.

== Quantum corral ==
[[File:The Well (Quantum Corral).jpg|thumb|left|''The Well (Quantum Corral)'' (2009) by [[Julian Voss-Andreae]]. Created using the 1993 experimental data by Lutz ''et al.'', the gilded sculpture was pictured in a 2009 review of the art exhibition "Quantum Objects" in the journal ''Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Philip| last = Ball |date=26 November 2009| title = Quantum objects on show | journal = Nature | volume = 462 | issue = 7272 | pages = 416 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v462/n7272/pdf/462416a.pdf | accessdate=2009-01-12| doi= 10.1038/462416a|bibcode = 2009Natur.462..416B }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The mirage occurs at the foci of a '''quantum corral''', a ring of atoms arranged in an arbitrary shape on a [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]].  The quantum corral was demonstrated in 1993 by Lutz, [[Donald Eigler|Eigler]], and [[Michael F Crommie|Crommie]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crommie MF, Lutz CP, Eigler DM |date=8 October 1993 | title = Confinement of electrons to quantum corrals on a metal surface. | journal = Science | volume = 262 | issue = 5131 | pages = 218–20 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/262/5131/218.full.pdf | accessdate=2011-11-08 | doi= 10.1126/science.262.5131.218|bibcode = 1991Sci...254.1319S }}&lt;/ref&gt; using an [[Ellipse|ellipitical]] ring of [[iron]] atoms on a [[copper]] surface using the tip of a low-temperature [[scanning tunneling microscope]] to manipulate individual atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Ben|title=Nanotechnology: Understanding Small Systems|year=2011|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ferromagnetic]] iron atoms reflected the surface electrons of the copper inside the ring into a wave pattern, as predicted by the theory of [[quantum mechanics]].

The size and shape of the corral determine its quantum states, including the energy and distribution of the electrons. To make conditions suitable for the mirage the team at Almaden chose a configuration of the corral which concentrated the electrons at the foci of the ellipse.

When scientists placed a magnetic cobalt atom at one focus of the corral, a mirage of the atom appeared at the other focus. Specifically the same electronic properties were present in the electrons surrounding both foci, even though the cobalt atom was only present at one focus. In scanning tunneling microscopy, an atomically sharp metal tip is advanced towards the atomically flat sample surface until electron tunneling out of the atom and into the advancing tip becomes effective. Using the sharp tip we can also arrange atoms adsorbed on the surface into unique shapes; for example, 48 adsorbed iron atoms on Cu(111) arranged into a 14.26&amp;nbsp;nm diameter circle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The electrons on the copper surface are trapped inside the circle formed by the iron atoms. A standing wave pattern emerges with a large peak at the center due to the constructive interference of electrons on the copper surface as they scatter off the adsorbed iron atoms.

== Applications ==
IBM scientists are hoping to use quantum mirages to construct atomic scale processors in the future.

'''Retrocomputing''' is the use of older computer [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[computer software|software]] in modern times. Retrocomputing is usually classed as a hobby and recreation rather than a practical application of technology; enthusiasts often collect rare and valuable hardware and software for sentimental reasons. However, some do make use of it.&lt;ref name="catb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/retro/ |title=The Retrocomputing Museum |publisher=Catb.org |date= |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Retrocomputing 2010 Athens Greece.jpg|thumb|Retrosystem 2010, a retrocomputing event in [[Athens]]]]

==Historical retrocomputing==
A more serious line of retrocomputing is part of the [[history of computer hardware]]. It can be seen as the analogue of [[experimental archaeology]] in computing.{{according to whom?|date=September 2018}} Some notable examples include the reconstruction of [[Babbage]]'s [[Difference engine]] (more than a century after its design) and the implementation of [[Plankalkül]] in 2000 (more than half a century since its inception).

=="Homebrew" computers==
Some retrocomputing enthusiasts also consider the 'Homebrewing' 
(designing and building of retro- and retro-styled computers or kits), to be an important aspect of the hobby, giving new enthusiasts an opportunity to experience more fully what the early years of hobby computing were like.&lt;ref name="catb" /&gt;  There are several different approaches to this end. Some are exact replicas of older systems, and some are newer designs based on the principles of retrocomputing, while others combine the two, with old and new features in the same package. Examples include:
*Device offered by [[IMSAI]], a modern, updated, yet backward-compatible version and replica of the original [[IMSAI 8080]], one of the most popular early personal systems;
* Several Apple 1 replicas and kits have been sold in limited quantities in recent years, by different builders, such as the "Replica 1", from Briel Computers.;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brielcomputers.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
*A currently ongoing project that uses old technology in a new design is the [[Z80]]-based [[N8VEM]];
*The Arduino Retro Computer kit is an open source, open hardware kit you can build and has a BASIC interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amigojapan.github.com/Arduino-Retro-Computer-with-SD-card-and-LCD-display-and-Keyboard-input-with-BASIC-interpreter/ |title=Arduino Retro Computer with SD card and LCD display and Keyboard input with BASIC interpreter |publisher=amigojapan.github.com |date= |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a version of the Arduino Retro Computer that can be hooked up to a TV.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amigojapan.github.com/Arduino-Retro-Computer-TV/ |title=Arduino Retro Computer TV |publisher=amigojapan.github.com |date= |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There is at least one remake of the Commodore 64 using an [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] configured to emulate the 6502.;&lt;ref name="c1"&gt;{{cite web
|url =http://c64upgra.de/c-one/
|title=C-one Reconfigurable computer
|accessdate=6 September 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*MSX 2/2+ compatible [[do-it-yourself]] kit [[GR8BIT]], designed for the hands-on education in electronics, deliberately employing old and new concepts and devices (high-capacity SRAMs, micro-controllers and FPGA).

==Vintage computers==
The personal computer has been around since approximately 1976. But in that time, numerous technological revolutions have left generations of obsolete computing equipment on the junk heap. Nevertheless, in that time, these otherwise useless computers have spawned a sub-culture of [[History of computing hardware|vintage computer]] collectors, who often spend large sums to acquire the rarest of these items, not only to display but restore to their fully functioning glory, including active software development and adaptation to modern uses. This often includes so-called [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hackers]] who add-on, update and create hybrid composites from new and old computers for uses for which they were otherwise never intended.  [[Ethernet]] interfaces have been designed for many vintage 8-bit machines to allow limited connectivity to the [[Internet]]; where users can access user groups, [[bulletin board]]s and databases of software.  Most of this hobby centers on those [[History of computing hardware (1960s–present)|computers manufactured after 1960]], though some collectors specialize in [[History of computing hardware|pre-1960 computers]] as well.

Southwest Technical Products Corporation ([[SWTPC]]) produced the SWTPC 6800 and later the SWTPC 6809 kits that employed the Motorola 68xx series microprocessors.  The 68xx line was to be followed later by the 6502 processor that was used in many early "home computers", such as the Apple II.

===Apple Inc.===
The earliest of the [[Apple Inc.]] personal computers are among some of the most collectible. They are relatively easy to maintain in an operational state thanks to Apple's use of readily available off-the-shelf parts.

*'''[[Apple I]]''': The Apple-1 was Apple's first product and has brought some of the highest prices ever paid for a microcomputer at auction.
*'''[[Apple II]]''': The Apple II series of computers are some of the easiest to adapt, thanks to the original expansion architecture designed into them. New [[Apple II peripheral cards|peripheral]] cards are still being designed by an avid thriving community, thanks to the longevity of this platform, manufactured from 1977 through 1993. Numerous websites exist to support not only the legacy users, but new adopters who weren't even born when the Apple II was discontinued by Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Weyhrich. Steven | url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/#02 | title=The Apple II | page=2 | publisher=apple2history.org | accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Macintosh]]''': Perhaps because of its friendly design and first commercially successful [[graphical user interface]] as well as its enduring [[Finder (software)|Finder]] application that persists on the most current Macs, the Macintosh is one of the most collected and used of the vintage computers. With dozens of websites around the world, old Macintosh hardware and software is put into daily use. Many maintain vast collections of functional and non-functional systems, which are lovingly maintained and discussed on worldwide user forums. The Macintosh had a strong presence in many early computer labs, creating a strong nostalgia factor for former students who recall their first computing experiences.

===RCA===
* The '''[[COSMAC ELF]]''' in 1976 was an inexpensive (about $100) single-board computer that was easily built by hobbyists. Many people who could not afford an Altair could afford an ELF, which was based on the RCA 1802 chip. Because the chips are still available from other sources, modern recreations of the ELF are fairly common and there are a number of fan web sites.
===IBM===
* The '''[[IBM 1130]]''' computing system from 1966 which still has a following of interested users, albeit via an emulator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibm1130.org/sim |title=Simulating the IBM 1130 on 21st-century hardware |publisher=IBM1130.org |date= | accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the actual machine.
* The '''[[IBM 5100|5100]]''' also has an avid collector and fan base.
* The '''[[IBM PC|PC]]''' series ([[IBM 5150|5150]] PC, [[IBM 5155|5155]] Portable PC, [[IBM 5160|5160]] PC/XT, [[IBM 5170|5170]] PC/AT) has become very popular in recent years, with the earliest models (PC) being considered the most collectible.

[[File:BBC Master with Retro Software games.jpg|thumb|upright|BBC Master with Retro Software games at the Wakefield RISC OS Show 2011]]

===Acorn BBC &amp; Archimedes===
* The [[Acorn Computers|Acorn]] '''[[BBC Micro]]''' was a very popular British computer in the 1980s with home and educational users, and enjoyed near universal usage in British schools into the mid-1990s.  It was possible to use 100K 5¼" disks and it had many expansion ports.
* The '''[[Acorn Archimedes|Archimedes]]''' series - the de facto successor to the BBC Micro - has also enjoyed a following in recent years, thanks to its status as the first computer to be based around [[Advanced RISC Machines|ARM]]'s [[RISC]] microprocessor.

===Tandy/Radio Shack===
* The [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]]/[[RadioShack]] '''[[Radio Shack Model 100|Model 100]]''' is still widely collected and used as one of the earliest examples of a truly portable computer.  Other Tandy offerings, such as the '''[[TRS-80]]''' line, are also very popular, and early systems, like the Model I, in good condition can command premium prices on the vintage computer market.

===Sinclair===
* The [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]] '''[[ZX81]]''' and '''[[ZX Spectrum]]''' series were the most popular British home computers of the early 1980s, with a wide choice of emulators available for both platforms.  The Spectrum in particular enjoys a cult following due to its popularity as a games platform, with new games titles still being developed even today.  Original "rubber key" Spectrums fetch the highest prices on the second hand market, with the later [[Amstrad]]-built models attracting less of a following.  The earlier ZX81 is not as popular in original hardware form due to its monochrome display and limited abilities next to the Spectrum, but still unassembled ZX81 kits still appear on eBay occasionally.

===MSX===
* Although nearly nonexistent in the United States, the [[MSX]] architecture has strong communities of fans and hobbyists worldwide, particularly in Japan (where the standard was conceived and developed), South Korea (the only country had a MSX based game console, Zemmix), Netherlands, Spain, Brazil, Argentina, Russia, Chile, the Middle East and others. New hardware and software are being actively developed to this day as well.
* One of the latest fundamental (from hardware and software perspectives) revivals of the MSX is the [[GR8BIT]].

===Robotron===
* The [[VEB Robotron|Robotron]] '''[[Robotron Z1013|Z1013]]''' was an East German home computer produced by VEB Robotron. It had a U880 processor, 16 kByte RAM and a membrane keyboard.
* The '''[[KC 85]]''' series of computers was a modular 8 bit computer system used in East German schools

A '''rice huller''' or '''rice husker''' is an [[agricultural machinery|agricultural machine]] used to automate the process of removing the [[chaff]] (the outer [[husk]]s) of grains of [[rice]]. Throughout history, there have been numerous techniques to hull rice. Traditionally, it would be pounded using some form of [[mortar and pestle]]. An early simple machine to do this is a [[rice pounder]]. Later even more efficient machinery was developed to hull and polish rice. These machines are most widely developed and used throughout [[Asia]] where the most popular type is the [[Engelberg Huller Company|Engelberg huller]] designed by [[German Brazilian]] engineer [[Evaristo Conrado Engelberg]] in Brazil and first patented in 1885.&lt;ref name=rm&gt;{{citation |pages=174–177 |title=The Rice Economy of Asia |volume=2 |author1=Randolph Barker |author2=Robert W. Herdt |author3=Beth Rose | year=1985 |isbn=978-0-915707-15-7 |chapter=Rice Milling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Engelberg huller uses steel rollers to remove the husk. Other types of huller include the disk or ''cono'' huller which uses an abrasive rotating disk to first remove the husk before passing the grain to conical rollers which [[brown rice|polish it]], this is done repeatedly since other sides of circular side of rice are not husked. Rubber rollers may be used to reduce the amount of breakage of the grains, so increasing the yield of the best quality ''head rice'', but the rubber rollers tend to require frequent replacement, which can be a significant drawback.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt;

[[Image:Para dynamics swrmeter dec07.jpg|thumb|right| An SWR meter to be used with CB radio equipment]]
The '''SWR meter''' or '''VSWR (voltage standing wave ratio) meter''' measures the [[standing wave ratio]] in a transmission line. The meter can be used to indicate the degree of mismatch between a [[transmission line]] and its [[Electrical load|load]] (usually a [[antenna (radio)|radio antenna]]), or evaluate the effectiveness of [[impedance matching]] efforts.

==Directional SWR Meter==
A directional SWR meter measures the magnitude of the forward &amp; reflected waves by sensing each one individually, with [[directional coupler]]s. A calculation can then be performed to arrive at the SWR.

[[File:SWR Meter.svg|400px|centre|thumb|A simple directional SWR meter]]

Referring to the above diagram, the transmitter ('''TX''') and antenna ('''ANT''') terminals are connected via an internal transmission line. This main line is electromagnetically coupled to two smaller sense lines (directional couplers) which are terminated with resistors at one end, and diode rectifiers at the other. Sometimes a [[printed circuit board]] using three parallel traces is used to make the transmission line and the two sensing lines. The resistors are chosen to match the characteristic [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the sense lines. The diodes convert the magnitudes of the forward &amp; reverse waves to '''FWD''' and '''REV''' DC voltages, respectively, which are then smoothed by the capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;ARRL Antenna Book, 2007, p. 27-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

To calculate the VSWR, first calculate the reflection coefficient:
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma =  \frac{V_{rev}}{V_{fwd}}&lt;/math&gt;

Then calculate the VSWR:
:&lt;math&gt;VSWR  =  \frac{1 + \Gamma}{1 - \Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

In a passive meter, this is usually indicated on a non-linear scale.
[[File:SWR &amp; power meter inner view.jpg|thumb|right|Interior view of an SWR meter. The three parallel coupled lines are visible. Diodes, capacitors and termination resistors are mounted at the ends of the sense lines.]]

==SWR Bridge==
SWR can also be measured using an impedance [[bridge circuit]]. The bridge is balanced (0 volts across the detector) only when the test impedance exactly matches the reference impedance. When a transmission line is mismatched (SWR &gt; 1:1), its input impedance deviates from its characteristic impedance; thus, a bridge can be used to determine the presence or absence of a low SWR.

To test for a match, the reference impedance of the bridge is set to the expected load impedance (for example, 50 ohms), and the transmission line connected as the unknown impedance. [[Radio frequency|RF]] power is applied to the circuit. The voltage at the line input represents the vector sum of the forward wave, and the wave reflected from the load. If the characteristic impedance of the line is known to be 50 ohms, we know the magnitude and phase of the forward wave; it is the same wave present on the other side of the detector. Subtracting this known wave from the wave present at the line input yields the reflected wave. Properly designed, a bridge circuit can be used not only to indicate a match, but the degree of mismatch - thus making it possible to calculate the SWR. This usually involves alternately connecting the reference wave and the reflected wave to a power meter, and comparing the magnitudes of the resulting deflections.&lt;ref&gt;ARRL Antenna Book, 2007, p. 27-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
An SWR meter does not measure the actual impedance of a load (the resistance and reactance), but only the mismatch ratio. To measure the actual impedance, an [[antenna analyzer]] or other similar RF measuring device is required. For accurate readings, the SWR meter must be matched to the line impedance, usually 50 or 75 ohms. To accommodate multiple impedances, some SWR meters have switches on the rear, to select the resistance appropriate for the sense lines.

An SWR meter should be connected to the line as close as possible to the antenna: All practical transmission lines have a certain amount of loss, which causes the reflected wave to be attenuated as it travels back along the line. Thus, the SWR is highest closest to the load, and only improves as the distance from the load increases, creating the false impression of a matched system.&lt;ref&gt;ARRL Antenna Book, 2007, p. 28-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Send My Bag''' is a [[luggage]] shipping company for [[Student|students]], business professionals, relocators, travelers, sports enthusiasts and holiday makers. Their delivery of belongings is designed to allow travelers to travel light at a lower cost than airline fees. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2401326/Ryanair-35-bag-luggage-expensive-cheaper-send-bag-courier.html|title=Ryanair £35 a bag luggage fare is so expensive it is cheaper to send your bag on holiday by courier|website=Mail Online|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/6309860/send-bags-ahead-flights-post-savings-holiday/|title=How you could save £82 per holiday by SENDING your bags ahead|date=2018-05-17|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Send My Bag was formed after founder Adam Ewart was charged excess baggage fees when helping his girlfriend travel home from university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sendmybag.com/about|title=Our Baggage Shipping Origins and the Send My Bag Team|last=SendMyBag.com|website=www.sendmybag.com|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.growthbusiness.co.uk/send-my-bag-hassle-airport-2552816/|title=Pack up and fly away! Send My Bag taking the hassle out of the airport|date=2017-11-01|work=Growth Business|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; After paying the fee Ewart returned home and searched the web for a service which offered to deliver luggage at a lower cost. With nothing found, he decided to start Send My Bag. Setting up just one web page for under £100, he created a simple booking system for the business venture.

Prior to 2011 Send My Bag primarily existed as a niche luggage shipper for [[student]]s. From 2011 onwards, their focus broadened as airlines such as [[Ryanair]] took additional steps to dissuade passengers from checking bags, and as airline revenue from baggage fees worldwide dramatically increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/subject_areas/airline_information/baggage_fees/index.html|title=Baggage Fees by Airline {{!}} Bureau of Transportation Statistics|website=www.rita.dot.gov|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service is available as an [[iOS]] app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/send-my-bag-app/id1120004498?mt=8|title=Send My Bag App|website=App Store|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2012, Ewart appeared on the [[BBC]] television program ''[[Dragons' Den (UK TV series)|Dragons' Den]]'' in search of an investment for his door to door baggage service. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://startups.co.uk/rejected-on-dragons-den-but-life-goes-on/|title=Rejected on Dragons' Den – but life goes on! - Startups.co.uk: Starting a business advice and business ideas|website=startups.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/10-minutes-withsend-bag-ceo-adam-ewart/entrepreneurs/article/1453250|title=10 minutes with...Send My Bag CEO Adam Ewart|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the unsuccessful appearance on ''Dragons' Den'', Send My Bag announced a £100k funding from investors Lough Shore Investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/10/dragons-den-reject-sendmybag-scores-100k-angel-funding-to-help-travellers-travel-light/|title=Dragon’s Den Reject SendmyBag Scores £100K Angel Funding To Help Travellers Travel Light|last=O'Hear|first=Steve|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.loughshore.co/post/31269377685/enter-the-dragon-sendmybag|title=Enter the Dragon - SendmyBag|website=Lough Shore Investments|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 24 November 2014 on CNBC news Ewart announced the launch of US worldwide services. In 2015 Send My Bag further expanded launching a US domestic service and worldwide services from [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/01/21/startup-sendmybag-launching-a-domestic-u-s-service/|title=Startup SendMyBag launching a domestic U.S. service|website=Fortune|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000333442|title=Baggage fees no more|website=CNBC|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Send My Bag provides 24hr worldwide support from offices in [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor, Northern Ireland]] and [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/24/sendmybag/|title=SendMyBag Arrives In The U.S. To Take Your Luggage When Airlines Won’t|last=O'Hear|first=Steve|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24434880|title=Jobs boost for Bangor baggage firm, Sendmybag|website=BBC News|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Service design sprint''' is a time-constrained, [[service design]] project that uses [[design thinking]] and [[service design]] tools to create a new service or improve an existing one. The name Service Design Sprint was first mentioned in 2014 in the book The Service Startup: Design Thinking Gets Lean written by Tenny Pinheiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Service-Startup-Design-Thinking-practical-ebook/dp/B00JS9VZ08/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540181906&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+service+startup|title=The Service Startup: Design Thinking Gets Lean (Elsevier, 2014)|website=|language=en-US|access-date=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.core77.com/posts/26931/Tennyson-Pinheiro-on-Implementing-Service-Design-Thinking-for-Startups-New-Book-Available-Now|title=Implementing Service Design Thinking for Startups|website=|language=en-US|access-date=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Elsevier 2014.

[[File:Foundations.png|thumb|Detail of solid ground floor and foundation.'']]
A '''solid ground [[floor]]''' consists of a layer of [[concrete]], which in the case of a domestic building will be the surface layer brought up to ground floor level with [[Construction aggregate|hardcore]] filling under it. The advantage of a solid ground floor is the elimination of dry rot and other problems normally associated with hollow joisted floors. The disadvantage is that the floor is less resilient to walk upon and may be more tiring for the user. Solid ground floors are usually found or situated in a [[kitchen]] but will be necessary for other rooms where wood blocks and other similar finishes are required. 
==Finishes applied to solid ground floors in construction==
'''Cement screed''': The concrete floor may be topped with a 25 mm thick cement and sand [[screed]] trowelled to a smooth finish. The usual mix is 1:3 and a colouring agent may be added to the mix to obtain a more attractive finish. The mix should be as dry as possible and the sand should be coarsely graded and clean to avoid shrinkage and cracking which might occur with a wet mix. The floor finish is carefully cured after laying.

'''Granolithic''': Granolithic is composed of cement and fine aggregate mortar, the aggregate being granite chippings, which will give the hard wearing quality of the finish. It will be laid with screed, trowelled or floated to an even and fine finish. Granolithic paving will be suitable in areas which are to receive hard wear although its appearance would not normally be suitable for internal domestic work.   

[[PVC tiles]]: Polyvinyl chloride tiles -These are another commonly used floor finish. After the floor has been laid with screed, these tiles are fixed with adhesive. They are attractive, smooth and cool, and damage can be repaired very easily as they are made in small square size, usually 150 mm to 225 mm. Though due to poor workmanship and dust this type of floor finish fails through lifting.

'''Terrazo''': Terrazo consists of a coloured element binder or matrix and [[marble]] chips mixed to specified proportions. The finish is hardwearing, attractive and resistant to chemical attack. [[Ebonite]] strips divide the terrazo into bays to avoid shrinkage and expansion.

'''Soundcast LLC''' is a privately funded company that creates [[wireless]] audio technologies for the consumer &amp; commercial markets. The company is headquartered in [[San Diego, California]].

Soundcast is a producer of [[wireless]] [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] [[Data transmission|transmission]] systems that overcome [[2.4GHz]] band [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]], and allow [[digital music]] to be listened to in stereo throughout the home or building through its proprietary wireless technology, Bluetooth®, DTS Play-Fi® and can be paired with Alexa®. &lt;ref&gt;Business Wire, November 8, 2006 http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services/3920851-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
The Soundcast product line has grown in stages since 2006. The first product, the AudioCast, was designed to create a bridge between an audio source and an audio speaker. With this creation came the [[G2 systems]] technology. Since then, the list of products has expanded by building on the G2 system first developed for the AudioCast. 
Some of the current products are:
===VG1===

===SurroundCast===

SurroundCast - a wireless rear or side speaker amplifier system. It consists of a transmitter with speaker level inputs and an amplified receiver module with 60 watts of digital power and speaker level outputs. The system allows you to set up any brand of surround speakers without the need for front to back of room wires. The system has a low latency (15 ms) and is a quick and easy installation. No programming, no fuss. Just great audio.
Note: SurroundCast is not compatible with any other Soundcast wireless products

===SubCast===

An exciting alternative to WIRES! SubCast allows any subwoofer to play wireless. It is also a full range transmitter - receiver system. It will transmit 20-20K Hertz and can be used to support full audio, not just Low Frequency Effects. It is marketed as a Sub kit but has many more very flexible uses. There is latency adjustment to 64Ms for longer range applications. No programming, no assigning IP addresses, just plug Sub "out" into SubCast transmitter and power it up, then plug Receiver module into Subwoofer inputs and power it up.

==Technology==
Soundcast forms a [[wireless bridge]] between an [[Audio frequency|audio]] source like an [[MP3]] player and an audio [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]] with [[plug-n-play]] setup. Soundcast's audio products incorporate [[2.4 GHz]] wireless [[technology]]. The Soundcast [[engineering]] team refined this [[wireless technology]] to avoid interference from other appliances like the [[microwave oven]] or the [[cordless phone]]. The wireless range is reported to be up to 350 feet.

Soundcast employs [[Spread Spectrum]] technology. This is widely regarded as the most effective method of achieving effective communication in the [[2.4GHz]] ISM band. There are two principle ways this can be done: Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum ([[Frequency-hopping spread spectrum|FHSS]])—such as used by [[Bluetooth]], and Direct Sequencing Spread Spectrum ([[DSSS]])—such as used by [[802.11b]]. Soundcast G2 [[transceivers]] use FHSS. This allows as many as three Soundcast [[G2 systems]] to operate in close proximity to each other. This also allows for [[wireless]] audio to be securely used in [[high density]] multi-unit dwellings ([[MUD]]). The platform also provides the [[flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] of being configured as a one [[transmitter]] one [[Receiver (information theory)|receiver]] system or a one [[transmitter]] multiple [[Receiver (information theory)|receiver]] system. The Soundcast G2 module integrates the [[Radio frequency|RF]] physical layer, [[baseband]], [[MAC protocol]], audio [[CODEC]], and dynamic error correction functions. Hardware forward error correction, adaptive frequency hopping, and dynamic hopping channel diversity are all built into the protocol of the system. The system also supports [[Duplex (telecommunications)|bi-directional]] communication for acknowledging and [[retransmission (data networks)|retransmission]] should packet loss occur.

==Environmental efforts==
Soundcast's products are [[RoHS]] compliant. This is a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] which restricts the use of certain [[hazardous]] substances in [[electrical]] and [[electronic equipment]]. This directive [[Ban (law)|bans]] from the market new [[electrical]] and electronic equipment containing more than agreed to levels of [[lead]], [[cadmium]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] [[hexavalent]] [[chromium]], polybrominated biphenyl ([[Polybrominated biphenyl|PBB]]) and polybrominated biphenyl Ether ([[PBDE]]) flame retardants.

[[Image:SpectrumAnalyzerDisplay.png|right|thumb|A modern spectrum analyzer display]]

A '''spectrum analyzer''' measures the magnitude of an input signal versus frequency within the full frequency range of the instrument. The primary use is to measure the power of the spectrum of known and unknown signals. The input signal that a spectrum analyzer measures is [[electricity|electrical]]; however, [[Frequency spectrum|spectral]] compositions of other signals, such as [[acoustics|acoustic]] pressure waves and [[optics|optical]] light waves, can be considered through the use of an appropriate [[transducer]]. Optical spectrum analyzers also exist, which use direct optical techniques such as a [[monochromator]] to make measurements.

By analyzing the [[Frequency spectrum|spectra]] of [[electricity|electrical]] signals, dominant [[frequency]], [[Electric Power|power]], [[distortion]], [[harmonics]], [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], and other [[Frequency spectrum|spectral]] components of a signal can be observed that are not easily detectable in [[time domain]] [[waveform]]s.  These parameters are useful in the characterization of electronic devices, such as [[Wireless|wireless transmitters]].

The display of a spectrum analyzer has frequency on the horizontal axis and the amplitude displayed on the vertical axis. To the casual observer, a spectrum analyzer looks like an [[oscilloscope]] and, in fact, some lab instruments can function either as an oscilloscope or a spectrum analyzer.

== History ==
{{expand section|date=December 2012}}
[[Image:sonagraphe.jpg|thumb|right|A spectrum analyzer circa 1970]]
The first spectrum analyzers, in the 1960s, were swept-tuned instruments.&lt;ref name="Hiebert"&gt;''[http://electronicdesign.com/displays/take-peek-inside-todays-spectrum-analyzers Take A Peek Inside Today's Spectrum Analyzers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506192902/http://www.electronicdesign.com/displays/take-peek-inside-todays-spectrum-analyzers |date=2017-05-06 }}''; Bob Hiebert, 2005, accessed 10 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the discovery of the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) in 1965, the first FFT-based analyzers were introduced in 1967.&lt;ref name="Deery"&gt;''[http://www.sandv.com/downloads/0701deer.pdf The ‘Real’ History of Real-Time Spectrum Analyzers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621073829/http://www.sandv.com/downloads/0701deer.pdf |date=2015-06-21 }}''; Joe Deery, 2007, accessed 10 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are three basic types of analyzer: the swept-tuned spectrum analyzer, the vector signal analyzer, and the real-time spectrum analyzer.&lt;ref name="Hiebert" /&gt;

== Types ==
[[Image:Spectrum Analyser PCB.jpg|thumb|right|The main PCB from a {{nowrap|20 GHz}} spectrum analyser. Showing the [[Distributed element filter|stripline PCB filters]], and modular block construction.]]
Spectrum analyzer types are distinguished by the methods used to obtain the spectrum of a signal. There are swept-tuned and [[Fast Fourier Transform]] (FFT) based spectrum analyzers:

*A ''swept-tuned'' analyzer uses a [[superheterodyne receiver]] to [[Superheterodyne receiver#High-side and low-side injection|down-convert]] a portion of the input signal spectrum to the center frequency of a narrow [[band-pass filter]], whose instantaneous output power is recorded or displayed as a function of time.  By sweeping the receiver's center-frequency (using a [[voltage-controlled oscillator]]) through a range of frequencies, the output is also a function of frequency.  But while the sweep centers on any particular frequency, it may be missing short-duration events at other frequencies.
*An FFT analyzer computes a time-sequence of [[periodogram]]s.  ''FFT'' refers to a particular mathematical algorithm used in the process.  This is commonly used in conjunction with a [[superheterodyne receiver|receiver]] and [[analog-to-digital converter]].  As above, the receiver reduces the center-frequency of a portion of the input signal spectrum, but the portion is not swept.  The purpose of the receiver is to reduce the [[sampling rate]] that the analyzer must contend with.  With a sufficiently low sample-rate, FFT analyzers can process all the samples (100% [[duty-cycle]]), and are therefore able to avoid missing short-duration events.

== Form factor ==
Spectrum analyzers tend to fall into four form factors: benchtop, portable, handheld and networked.

===Benchtop===
This form factor is useful for applications where the spectrum analyzer can be plugged into AC power, which generally means in a lab environment or production/manufacturing area. Bench top spectrum analyzers have historically offered better performance and specifications than the portable or handheld form factor. Bench top spectrum analyzers normally have multiple fans (with associated vents) to dissipate heat produced by the [[Central processing unit|processor]]. Due to their architecture, bench top spectrum analyzers typically weigh more than {{convert|30|lbs|kg}}. Some bench top spectrum analyzers offer optional [[battery pack]]s, allowing them to be used away from [[AC power]]. This type of analyzer is often referred to as a "portable" spectrum analyzer.

=== Portable ===
This form factor is useful for any applications where the spectrum analyzer needs to be taken outside to make measurements or simply carried while in use. Attributes that contribute to a useful portable spectrum analyzer include:
*Optional battery-powered operation to allow the user to move freely outside.
*Clearly viewable display to allow the screen to be read in bright sunlight, darkness or dusty conditions..
*Light weight (usually less than {{convert|15|lbs|kg}}).

=== Handheld ===
This form factor is useful for any application where the spectrum analyzer needs to be very light and small. Handheld analyzers usually offer a limited capability relative to larger systems. Attributes that contribute to a useful handheld spectrum analyzer include:
*Very low power consumption.
*Battery-powered operation while in the field to allow the user to move freely outside.
*Very small size
*Light weight (usually less than {{convert|2|lbs|kg|1}}).

=== Networked ===
This form factor does not include a display and these devices are designed to enable a new class of geographically-distributed spectrum monitoring and analysis applications. The key attribute is the ability to connect the analyzer to a network and monitor such devices across a network.  While many spectrum analyzers have an Ethernet port for control, they typically lack efficient data transfer mechanisms and are too bulky or expensive to be deployed in such a distributed manner.   Key applications for such devices include RF intrusion detection systems for secure facilities where wireless signaling is prohibited.  As well cellular operators are using such analyzers to remotely monitor interference in licensed spectral bands.  The distributed nature of such devices enable geo-location of transmitters, spectrum monitoring for dynamic spectrum access and many other such applications.

Key attributes of such devices include:
* Network-efficient data transfer
* Low power consumption
* The ability to synchronize data captures across a network of analyzers
* Low cost to enable mass deployment.

== Theory of operation ==
[[Image:BPFAnimationV2.gif|right|This animation shows how the resolution bandwidth of a swept-tuned spectrum analyzer is affected by the IF bandpass filter. Notice that wider bandwidth filters are unable to resolve the two closely space frequencies and the LO feedthrough causes the appearance of a baseband signal.]]

=== Swept-tuned ===
As discussed above in '''types''', a swept-tuned spectrum analyzer [[Superheterodyne receiver#High-side and low-side injection|down-converts]] a portion of the input signal spectrum to the center frequency of a [[band-pass filter]] by sweeping the [[voltage-controlled oscillator]] through a range of frequencies, enabling the consideration of the full frequency range of the instrument.

The bandwidth of the [[band-pass filter]] dictates the resolution bandwidth, which is related to the minimum bandwidth detectable by the instrument.  As demonstrated by the animation to the right, the smaller the bandwidth, the more spectral resolution. However, there is a trade-off between how quickly the display can update the full frequency span under consideration and the frequency resolution, which is relevant for distinguishing frequency components that are close together.  For a swept-tuned architecture, this relation for sweep time is useful:

: &lt;math&gt;\ ST=\frac{k(\mathrm{Span})}{RBW^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ST is sweep time in seconds, k is proportionality constant, Span is the frequency range under consideration in hertz, and RBW is the resolution bandwidth in Hertz.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5952-0292.pdf Keysight Spectrum Analyzer Basics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323154714/http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5952-0292.pdf |date=2018-03-23 }}'', p. 23, August 2, 2006, accessed July 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sweeping too fast, however, causes a drop in displayed amplitude and a shift in the displayed frequency.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5952-0292.pdf Keysight Spectrum Analyzer Basics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323154714/http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5952-0292.pdf |date=2018-03-23 }}'', p. 22, Figure 2–14, August 2, 2006, accessed July 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the animation contains both up- and down-converted spectra, which is due to a [[frequency mixer]] producing both sum and difference frequencies. The [[local oscillator]] feedthrough is due to the imperfect isolation from the [[intermediate frequency|IF]] signal path in the [[Frequency mixer|mixer]].

For very weak signals, a [[pre-amplifier]] is used, although [[total harmonic distortion|harmonic]] and [[intermodulation]] distortion may lead to the creation of new frequency components that were not present in the original signal.

=== FFT-based ===
With an FFT based spectrum analyzer, the frequency resolution is &lt;math&gt;\Delta\nu=1/T&lt;/math&gt;, the inverse of the time ''T'' over which the waveform is measured and Fourier transformed.

With Fourier transform analysis in a digital spectrum analyzer, it is necessary to sample the input signal with a sampling frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu_s&lt;/math&gt; that is at least twice the bandwidth of the signal, due to the [[Nyquist rate|Nyquist limit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.keysight.com/main/editorial.jspx?cc=US&amp;lc=eng&amp;ckey=1775376&amp;nid=-536900125.0.00&amp;id=1775376&amp;pselect=SR.GENERAL|title=How do I know what is the best sampling rate to use for my measurement? - Keysight (formerly Agilent’s Electronic Measurement)|author=|date=|website=www.keysight.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323154748/https://www.keysight.com/main/editorial.jspx?cc=US&amp;lc=eng&amp;ckey=1775376&amp;nid=-536900125.0.00&amp;id=1775376&amp;pselect=SR.GENERAL|archivedate=23 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Fourier transform will then produce a spectrum containing all frequencies from zero to &lt;math&gt;\nu_s/2&lt;/math&gt;. This can place considerable demands on the required [[analog-to-digital converter]] and processing power for the Fourier transform, making FFT based spectrum analyzers limited in frequency range.

Since FFT based analyzers are only capable of considering narrow bands, one technique is to combine swept and FFT analysis for consideration of wide and narrow spans. This technique allows for faster sweep time.

This method is made possible by first down converting the signal, then digitizing the [[intermediate frequency]] and using superheterodyne or FFT techniques to acquire the spectrum.

One benefit of digitizing the intermediate frequency is the ability to use [[digital filter]]s, which have a range of [[Digital filter#Comparison of analog and digital filters|advantages]] over analog filters such as near perfect shape factors and improved filter settling time. Also, for consideration of narrow spans, the FFT can be used to increase sweep time without distorting the displayed spectrum.

=== Realtime FFT ===

[[Image:Bluetooth signal behind wireless lan signal.png|thumb|right|400px|Bluetooth signal hidden behind wireless LAN signal]]

A realtime spectrum analyser does not have any such blind time—up to some maximum span, often called the "realtime bandwidth". The analyser is able to sample the incoming RF spectrum in the time domain and convert the information to the frequency domain using the FFT process. FFT's are processed in parallel, gapless and overlapped so there are no gaps in the calculated RF spectrum and no information is missed.

==== Online realtime and offline realtime ====
In a sense, any spectrum analyzer that has [[vector signal analyzer]] capability is a realtime analyzer. It samples data fast enough to satisfy Nyquist Sampling theorem and stores the data in memory for later processing. This kind of analyser is only realtime for the amount of data / capture time it can store in memory and still produces gaps in the spectrum and results during processing time.

==== FFT overlapping ====
Minimizing distortion of information is important in all spectrum analyzers. The FFT process applies windowing techniques to improve the output spectrum due to producing less side lobes. The effect of windowing may also reduce the level of a signal where it is captured on the boundary between one FFT and the next. For this reason FFT's in a Realtime spectrum analyzer are overlapped. Overlapping rate is approximately 80%. An analyzer that utilises a 1024-point FFT process will re-use approximately 819 samples from the previous FFT process.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/applications/implementation-of-real-time-spectrum-analysis-white-paper_230854-15815.html Dr. Florian Ramian – Implementation of Real-Time Spectrum Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209182434/https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/applications/implementation-of-real-time-spectrum-analysis-white-paper_230854-15815.html |date=2018-02-09 }}'', p. 6, March, 2015, accessed February 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Minimum signal detection time ====
This is related to the sampling rate of the analyser and the [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] rate.  It is also important for the realtime spectrum analyzer to give good level accuracy.

Example: for an analyser with {{nowrap|40 MHz}} of realtime [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] (the maximum RF span that can be processed in realtime) approximately {{nowrap|50 Msample/second}} (complex) are needed.  If the spectrum analyzer produces {{nowrap|250 000 FFT/s}} an FFT calculation is produced every {{nowrap|4 µs.}}  For a {{nowrap|1024 point}} FFT a full spectrum is produced {{nowrap|1024 x (1/50 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;),}} approximately every {{nowrap|20 µs.}}  This also gives us our overlap rate of 80% {{nowrap|(20 µs − 4 µs) / 20 µs &amp;#61; 80%.}}

===== Persistence =====
Realtime spectrum analyzers are able to produce much more information for users to examine the frequency spectrum in more detail. A normal swept spectrum analyzer would produce max peak, min peak displays for example but a realtime spectrum analyzer is able to plot all calculated FFT's over a given period of time with the added colour-coding which represents how often a signal appears. For example, this image shows the difference between how a spectrum is displayed in a normal swept spectrum view and using a "Persistence" view on a realtime spectrum analyzer.

===== Hidden signals =====
Realtime spectrum analyzers are able to see signals hidden behind other signals. This is possible because no information is missed and the display to the user is the output of FFT calculations. An example of this can be seen on the right.

== Typical functionality ==

=== Center frequency and span ===
In a typical spectrum analyzer there are options to set the start, stop, and center frequency. The frequency halfway between the stop and start frequencies on a spectrum analyzer display is known as the '''center frequency'''. This is the frequency that is in the middle of the display’s frequency axis. '''Span''' specifies the range between the start and stop frequencies.  These two parameters allow for adjustment of the display within the frequency range of the instrument to enhance visibility of the spectrum measured.

=== Resolution bandwidth ===
As discussed in the '''operation''' section, the '''resolution bandwidth''' filter or RBW filter is the [[bandpass filter]] in the [[intermediate frequency|IF]] path.  It's the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the [[Radio frequency|RF]] chain before the detector (power measurement device).&lt;ref name=plsa&gt;[http://www.piclist.com/techref/postbot.asp?by=thread&amp;id=%5BEE%5D+TV+Tuner+Based+Spectrum+Analyzer&amp;w=body&amp;tgt=post&amp;at=20120524233824apiclist.com – &amp;#91;EE&amp;#93; TV Tuner Based Spectrum Analyzer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055149/http://www.piclist.com/techref/postbot.asp?by=thread&amp;id=%5BEE%5D+TV+Tuner+Based+Spectrum+Analyzer&amp;w=body&amp;tgt=post&amp;at=20120524233824apiclist.com |date=2013-09-21 }}, 2012-05-25&lt;/ref&gt;  It determines the RF [[noise floor]] and how close two signals can be and still be resolved by the analyzer into two separate peaks.&lt;ref name=plsa/&gt;  Adjusting the bandwidth of this filter allows for the discrimination of signals with closely spaced frequency components, while also changing the measured noise floor. Decreasing the bandwidth of an RBW filter decreases the measured noise floor and vice versa. This is due to higher RBW filters passing more frequency components through to the [[envelope detector]] than lower bandwidth RBW filters, therefore a higher RBW causes a higher measured noise floor.

=== Video bandwidth ===
The '''video bandwidth''' filter or VBW filter is the [[low-pass filter]] directly after the [[envelope detector]].  It's the bandwidth of the signal chain after the detector.  Averaging or peak detection then refers to how the digital storage portion of the device records samples—it takes several samples per time step and stores only one sample, either the average of the samples or the highest one.&lt;ref name=plsa/&gt;  The video bandwidth determines the capability to discriminate between two different power levels.&lt;ref name=plsa/&gt;  This is because a narrower VBW will remove noise in the detector output.&lt;ref name=plsa/&gt; This filter is used to “smooth” the display by removing noise from the envelope. Similar to the RBW, the VBW affects the sweep time of the display if the VBW is less than the RBW. If VBW is less than RBW, this relation for sweep time is useful:

:&lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{sweep} = \frac{k (f_2 - f_1)}{\mathrm{RBW}\times \mathrm{VBW}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''t''&lt;sub&gt;sweep&lt;/sub&gt; is the sweep time, ''k'' is a dimensionless proportionality constant, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the frequency range of the sweep, RBW is the resolution bandwidth, and VBW is the video bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5952-0292.pdf Keysight Spectrum Analyzer Basics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323154714/http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5952-0292.pdf |date=2018-03-23 }}'', p. 36, August 2, 2006, accessed July 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detector ===
With the advent of digitally based displays, some modern spectrum analyzers use [[analog-to-digital converter]]s to sample spectrum amplitude after the VBW filter. Since displays have a discrete number of points, the frequency span measured is also digitised. '''Detectors''' are used in an attempt to adequately map the correct signal power to the appropriate frequency point on the display. There are in general three types of detectors: sample, peak, and average
*'''Sample detection''' – sample detection simply uses the midpoint of a given interval as the display point value. While this method does represent random noise well, it does not always capture all sinusoidal signals.
*'''Peak detection''' – peak detection uses the maximum measured point within a given interval as the display point value. This insures that the maximum sinusoid is measured within the interval; however, smaller sinusoids within the interval may not be measured. Also, peak detection does not give a good representation of random noise.
*'''Average detection''' – average detection uses all of the data points within the interval to consider the display point value. This is done by power ([[Root mean square|rms]]) averaging, voltage averaging, or log-power averaging.

=== Displayed average noise level ===
The '''Displayed Average Noise Level''' (DANL) is just what it says it is—the average noise level displayed on the analyzer.  This can either be with a specific resolution bandwidth (e.g. −120 dBm @1&amp;nbsp;kHz RBW), or normalized to 1&amp;nbsp;Hz (usually in dBm/Hz) e.g. −170 dBm(Hz).This is also called the sensitivity of the spectrum analyzer. If a signal level equal to the average noise level is fed there will be a 3&amp;nbsp;dB display. To increase the sensitivity of the spectrum analyzer a preamplifier with lower noise figure may be connected at the input of the spectrum analyzer. co&lt;ref&gt;''[http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5952-0292.pdf Keysight Spectrum Analyzer Basics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323154714/http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5952-0292.pdf |date=2018-03-23 }}'', p. 50, August 2, 2006, accessed March 25, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio-frequency uses ==
[[File:8k UHD (7680 × 2160) Demo picture showing a high resolution GSM frequency spectrum.jpg|360px|thumb|MCS software showing an ultra high resolution (8k UHD with 7680×2160 pixel) EMC test including some limit lines within the GSM frequency spectrum]]
Spectrum analyzers are widely used to measure the [[frequency response]], [[Electronic noise|noise]] and [[distortion]] characteristics of all kinds of [[radio-frequency]] (RF) circuitry, by comparing the input and output spectra.For example, in RF mixers, spectrum analyzer is used to find the levels of third order inter-modulation products and conversion loss. In RF oscillators, spectrum analyzer is used to find the levels of different harmonics.

In [[telecommunications]], spectrum analyzers are used to determine occupied bandwidth and track interference sources. For example, cell planners use this equipment to determine interference sources in the [[GSM frequency bands]] and [[UMTS frequency bands]].

In [[electromagnetic compatibility|EMC testing]], a spectrum analyzer is used for basic precompliance testing; however, it can not be used for full testing and certification.  Instead, an EMI receiver is used.

A spectrum analyzer is used to determine whether a wireless transmitter is working according to defined standards for purity of emissions. Output signals at frequencies other than the intended communications frequency appear as vertical lines (pips) on the display. A spectrum analyzer is also used to determine, by direct observation, the bandwidth of a digital or analog signal.

A spectrum analyzer interface is a device that connects to a wireless receiver or a personal computer to allow visual detection and analysis of electromagnetic signals over a defined band of frequencies. This is called panoramic reception and it is used to determine the frequencies of sources of interference to wireless networking equipment, such as Wi-Fi and wireless routers.

Spectrum analyzers can also be used to assess RF shielding. RF shielding is of particular importance for the siting of a magnetic resonance imaging machine since stray RF fields would result in artifacts in an MR image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/RPT_100.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120045254/https://aapm.org/pubs/reports/RPT_100.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audio-frequency uses ==
Spectrum analysis can be used at [[Audio frequency|audio frequencies]] to analyse the harmonics of an audio signal. A typical application is to measure the [[distortion]] of a nominally [[sinewave]] signal; a very-low-distortion sinewave is used as the input to equipment under test, and a spectrum analyser can examine the output, which will have added distortion products, and determine the percentage distortion at each harmonic of the fundamental. Such analysers were at one time described as "wave analysers". Analysis can be carried out by a general-purpose [[digital computer]] with a [[sound card]] selected for suitable performance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarisonus.com/Research%20Reports/RR001-SoundCardEval/RR001-PCsoundCards.html ClariSonus Research Report #001, PC Sound Card Evaluation,John Atwood, 2006.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705033550/http://clarisonus.com/Research%20Reports/RR001-SoundCardEval/RR001-PCsoundCards.html |date=2011-07-05 }} Detailed tests of various sound cards for use as D/A and A/D converters for sound testing software on a PC&lt;/ref&gt; and appropriate software. Instead of using a low-distortion sinewave, the input can be subtracted from the output, attenuated and phase-corrected, to give only the added distortion and noise, which can be analysed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ab3/mjramp/golopid6.html|title=Renardson audio designs: Distortion measurement|author=|date=|website=angelfire.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625064334/http://www.angelfire.com/ab3/mjramp/golopid6.html|archivedate=25 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative technique, [[THD analyzer|total harmonic distortion measurement]], cancels out the fundamental with a [[notch filter]] and measures the total remaining signal, which is total harmonic distortion plus noise; it does not give the harmonic-by-harmonic detail of an analyser.

Spectrum analyzers are also used by audio engineers to assess their work. In these applications, the spectrum analyzer will show volume levels of frequency bands across the typical [[hearing range|range of human hearing]], rather than displaying a wave. In live sound applications, engineers can use them to pinpoint [[feedback]].

== Optical spectrum analyzer ==
An optical spectrum analyzer uses reflective or refractive techniques to separate out the wavelengths of light. An electro-optical detector is used to measure the intensity of the light, which is then normally displayed on a screen in a similar manner to a radio- or audio-frequency spectrum analyzer.

The input to an optical spectrum analyzer may be simply via an aperture in the instrument's case, an optical fiber or an optical connector to which a fiber-optic cable can be attached.

Different techniques exist for separating out the wavelengths. One method is to use a [[monochromator]], for example a Czerny–Turner design, with an optical detector placed at the output slit. As the grating in the monochromator moves, bands of different frequencies (colors) are 'seen' by the detector, and the resulting signal can then be plotted on a display. More precise measurements (down to MHz in the optical spectrum) can be made with a scanning [[Fabry–Pérot interferometer]] along with analog or digital control electronics, which sweep the resonant frequency of an optically resonant cavity using a voltage ramp to [[Piezoelectricity#Piezoelectric motors|piezoelectric motor]] that varies the distance between two highly reflective mirrors. A sensitive [[photodiode]] embedded in the cavity provides an intensity signal, which is plotted against the ramp voltage to produce a visual representation of the optical power spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Final Report {{cite web |url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~jdilles/capstone/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817164232/http://mason.gmu.edu/~jdilles/capstone/ |archivedate=2016-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency response of optical spectrum analyzers tends to be relatively limited, e.g. {{nowrap|800–1600 nm}} (near-infrared), depending on the intended purpose, although (somewhat) wider-bandwidth general purpose instruments are available.

== Vibration spectrum analyzer ==
A vibration spectrum analyzer allows to analyze vibration amplitudes at various component frequencies, In this way, vibration occurring at specific frequencies can be identified and tracked. Since particular machinery problems generate vibration at specific frequencies, machinery faults can be detected or diagnosed.  Vibration Spectrum Analyzers use the signal from different types of sensor, such as: [[Accelerometer|accelerometers]], velocity transducers and [[Proximity_sensor|proximity sensors]].  The uses of a vibration spectrum analyzer in machine condition monitoring allows to detect and identify machine faults such as: rotor imbalance, shaft misalignment, mechanical looseness, bearing defects, among others.  Vibration analysis can also be used in structures to identify structural resonances or to perform modal analysis.

'''Telepresence technology''' is a term used by the  [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) to refer to  the combination of satellite technology  with the Internet to broadcast information, including video in real-time from cameras used on its remotely operated vehicle (ROV) on  ''[[Okeanos Explorer]]''. Its ROV will be operating working in a deep sea environment. Data from the ROV is transmitted to a hub based on the land, which then send it to scientists and to the public.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:NP231PTmSOTF.jpg|thumb|Inside of a 231 New Process Gear transfer case.  Part-time/Manual, shift on the fly]]

A '''transfer case''' is a part of the [[drivetrain]] of [[four-wheel-drive]], [[all-wheel-drive]], and other multiple powered [[axle]] vehicles.  The transfer case transfers power from the [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] to the front and rear axles by means of [[drive shaft]]s. It also synchronizes the difference between the rotation of the front and rear wheels, and may contain one or more sets of [[gear ratio|low range gears]] for off-road use.

==Functions==
* The transfer case receives power from the transmission and sends it to both the front and rear axles.  This can be done with gears, hydraulics, or chain drive.  On some vehicles, such as four-wheel-drive trucks or vehicles intended for off-road use, this feature is controlled by the driver.  The driver can put the transfer case into either "two-wheel-drive" or "four-wheel-drive" mode.  This is sometimes accomplished by means of a [[Gear selector|shifter]], similar to that in a [[manual transmission]].  On some vehicles this may be electronically operated by a switch instead.  Some vehicles, such as all-wheel-drive sports cars, have transfer cases that are not selectable.  Such a transfer case is permanently "locked" into all-wheel-drive mode.
* Transfer cases that are designed to allow for normal road use synchronize the difference between the rotation of the front and rear wheels,&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdxetextbook.com/trans/finalDrives/allWheel/transfercasediff.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225131043/http://www.cdxetextbook.com/trans/finalDrives/allWheel/transfercasediff.html |archivedate=2007-12-25 |df= }} Transfer case differential action&lt;/ref&gt; in much the same way the [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] acts on a given axle. This is necessary because the front and rear tires never turn at the same speed.  Different rates of tire rotation are generally due to different tire diameters (since front and rear tires inevitably wear at different rates) and different gear ratios in the front and rear differentials since manufacturers will often have a slightly lower ratio in the front vs. the rear to help with control (such as a 3.55:1 in the rear differential and a 3.54:1 in the front differential).  If the transfer case did not make up the difference between the two different rates of rotation, binding would occur and the transfer case could become damaged.  This is also why a transfer case that is not designed for on-road use will cause problems with [[driveline windup]] if driven on dry pavement.
* Transfer cases designed for off-road use can mechanically lock the front and rear axles when needed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fourwheeler.com/techarticles/68958_how_transfer_cases_work/index.html How Transfer Cases Work&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. when one of the axles is on a slippery surfaces or stuck in mud, whereas the other has better traction). This is the equivalent to the [[Locking differential|differential lock]].
* The transfer case may contain one or more sets of [[gear ratio|low range gears]] for off-road use.  Low range gears are engaged with a shifter or electronic switch. On many transfer cases, this shifter is the same as the one that selects 2WD or 4WD operation.  Low range gears allow the vehicle to drive at much slower speeds while still operating within the usable power band / RPM range of the engine.  This also increases the torque available at the axles.  Low-range gears are used for very inclement road conditions, towing a heavy load, driving on unimproved roads, and extreme off-road maneuvers such as [[rockcrawling]].  This feature is often absent on all-wheel-drive cars.  Some very large vehicles, such as heavy equipment or military trucks, may have more than one low-range gear.

==Types==
Transfer cases used on [[Four-wheel drive#Part-time|"part-time"]] four-wheel-drive off-road vehicles such as trucks, [[truggy|truggies]], rock-crawling vehicles, and some military vehicles generally allow the driver to select 2WD or 4WD, as well as high or low gear ranges. Those used in sports cars and performance sedans are usually "transparent" to the driver; there is no shifter or select lever.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Drive type===

====Gear-driven====
There are two different types of internal power-transfer mechanism found in most transfer cases. Gear-driven transfer cases use sets of gears to drive either the front or both the front and rear driveshafts. These are generally strong, heavy units that are used in large trucks, but there are currently several gear drive cases in production for passenger cars.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

====Chain-driven====
Chain-driven transfer cases use a chain to drive most often only one axle, but can drive both axles. Chain-driven transfer cases are quieter and lighter than gear-driven ones.  They are used in vehicles such as compact trucks, full size trucks, [[Jeep]]s and [[SUV]]s.  Some off-road driving enthusiasts modify their vehicles to use gear-driven transfer cases, accepting the additional weight and noise to gain the extra strength they generally provide.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Housing type===

====Married====
Transfer cases are also classified as either "divorced"/independent or "married". Married transfer cases are bolted directly to the transmission, usually between the transmission's output shaft and the rear or main driveshaft. Sometimes a married transfer case is an integral part of the transmission and the two components share the same housing or "case", as is commonly found on recent [[Subaru]] products and some other [[Four-wheel drive#AWD|all-wheel-drive]] cars.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

====Divorced/independent====
A divorced or independent transfer case is completely separate from the transmission. It is located further down the driveline than a married transfer case and connected to the transmission output shaft by a short driveshaft.  Independent transfer cases are used on very long wheelbase vehicles, such as commercial trucks or military trucks.

===Transfer case shift type===

====M.S.O.F.====
Manual Shift On-the-Fly transfer cases have a selector lever on the driver's side floor transmission hump and may also have either two sealed automatic front axle [[locking hubs]] or two manual front axle hub selectors of "LOCK" and "UNLOCK" or "FREE".  To engage the four-wheel-drive system the vehicle must be moving at a low speed, the speed at which 4x4 can be engaged depends on the vehicle.  This is only for the four-wheel-drive '''high''' setting.  To engage the four-wheel-drive '''low''' setting, the vehicle must be stopped and the transmission must be shifted to neutral, then the four-wheel-drive low can be selected.

====E.S.O.F.====
Electronic Shift On-the-Fly (ESOF) transfer cases have a dash-mounted selector switch or buttons with front sealed automatic locking axle hubs or drive flanges.  Unlike the manual transfer case, this system has a transfer case motor.  To engage the four-wheel-drive system the vehicle must be moving at a lower speeds, the speed at which 4x4 can be engaged depends on the vehicle.  This is only for the four-wheel-drive '''high''' setting. To engage the four-wheel-drive '''low''' setting, the vehicle must be stopped and the transmission must be shifted to neutral, then the four-wheel-drive low can be selected.
