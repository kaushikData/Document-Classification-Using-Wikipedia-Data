The '''Australian Film Institute''' ('''AFI''') was founded in 1958 as a [[non-profit]] organisation devoted to developing an active film culture in Australia and fostering engagement between the general public and the [[Cinema of Australia|Australian film industry]]. It is responsible for producing Australia's premier annual film and television awards, as of 2011 known as [[AACTA Awards]] (previously the AFI Awards).&lt;ref name=afiabout&gt;[http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=4593&amp;Section=History_of_AFI "The Australian Film Institute – Celebrating 50 Years of Pride and Passion"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521000000/http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=4593&amp;Section=History_of_AFI |date=May 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the institute is supported by government funding, corporate sponsors and approximately 10,000 members nationally. As Australia's foremost motion picture industry association, AFI promotes the Australian film and television industry and plays a central role in the way in which the Australian film industry is known and understood, both locally and internationally.&lt;ref name=afiabout /&gt;

In the 1970s, the AFI played a prominent part in reviving the Australian film industry and in convincing the government to invest in the creation of the Experimental Film Fund, a film school, and a corporation for advancing feature film production. The year 1976 marked the first time that the AFI Awards, which had been given since 1958, were televised.  Ten years later, television categories were added to the awards.  

A recent focus of the organisation has been on helping to develop the careers of Australian film artists, through the AFI Fellowship and AFI Documentary Trailbrazer programs, as well as with the AFI Young Film Actor Award.&lt;ref name="afiabout" /&gt;

The AFI is affiliated with the [[LAAFTA|Los Angeles Australian Film &amp; Television Association]]. In August 2011, AFI formed a subsidiary professional organisation, the [[Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/afi-is-recast-with-new-academy-taking-a-bow-20110818-1izyb.html|title=AFI is recast with new academy taking a bow|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bloodsport 4: The Dark Kumite''''' is the fourth and final film in the [[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]] [[Media franchise|franchise]]. It was released [[direct-to-video]] in 1999 and stars [[Daniel Bernhardt]] as [[police officer]] John Keller.

==Plot==
Agent John Keller ([[Daniel Bernhardt]]) goes undercover into the tough [[prison]] known as Fuego Penal to find out about the corpses of prisoners disappearing without a trace. There he gets involved in a dangerous [[tournament]] arranged by a man named Justin Caesar (Ivan Ivanov), where the prisoners are forced to fight to the death. The tournament has only one rule: There are no rules.

==Cast==
*[[Daniel Bernhardt]] – Agent John Keller
* Ivan Ivanov - Justin Caesar
* Lisa Stothard  – Blaire
* Stefanos Miltsakakis – Schrek
* Michael Krawic – Winston
*[[Derek McGrath]] – Warden Preston
* David Rowe – Billings
* Elvis Restaino – Dr. Rosenbloom
* Dennis LaValle – Files
* Christine Marais – Regina
* Jeff Moldovan – Captain Anderson
* Mike Kirton – Prison Guard
* Mitko Kiskimov – Tongo
* Linda Kouleva – Rita
*[[Stefan Valdobrev]] – Gills

==Production==
The [[prison]] [[Sequence (film)|sequences]] were shot at a real prison in [[Bulgaria]] and actual prisoners were [[Extra (actor)|extras]] in the [[Scene (film)|scenes]]. Although the film was shot in Bulgaria, ''Bloodsport 4'' is set in the United States. This not only makes it the only ''Bloodsport'' [[movie]] set there, but the only ''Bloodsport'' movie to not be set where it was shot. Though [[Daniel Bernhardt]] stars in all ''Bloodsport'' films except [[Bloodsport (film)|the first]], his [[Fictional character|character]] is not Alex Cardo from ''[[Bloodsport III]]'' but it is now John Keller in this film.

==Reception==
The film was panned by critics. Robert Pardi of TvGuide gave the film one star and said: "The good news is that you needn't bother watching the first three BLOODSPORT flicks in order to make sense of this sequel. The bad news is that it's pure Grade-Z schlock." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvguide.com/movies/bloodsport-4-dark-kumite/review/134613/&lt;/ref&gt;

==International titles==
*[[Argentina]]: ''Bloodsport: Matar O Morir'' (Bloodsport: Kill Or Die)
*[[Brazil]]: ''O Grande Dragāo Branco 4: O Capítulo Final'' (The Great White Dragon 4: The Last Chapter)
*[[Lithuania]]: ''Кровавый Спорт IV: Цвет Тьмы''
*[[Portugal]]: ''Bloodsport IV: Condenado À Morte'' (Bloodsport IV: Condemned To Death)
*Spain: ''Contacto Sangriento 4: El Kumite Oscuro'' (Bloody Contact 4: The Dark Kumite)

The '''bolero''' is a 3/4 dance&lt;ref&gt;(see [[Time signature]] and [[meter (music)]])&lt;/ref&gt; that originated in Spain in the late 18th century, a combination of the [[contradanza]] and the [[sevillana]].&lt;ref name="Morales, p120"&gt;Morales, p120&lt;/ref&gt; Dancer [[Sebastiano Carezo]] is credited with inventing the dance in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/830283 Journal of the American Musicological Society] '''24''', (Autumn, 1971), p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; It is danced by either a [[solo (music)|solo]]ist or a couple. It is in a moderately slow tempo and is performed to music which is sung and accompanied by [[castanets]] and [[guitar]]s with lyrics of five to seven syllables in each of four lines per verse. It is in [[time signature|triple time]] and usually has a [[Tuplet|triplet]] on the second beat of each bar.

==Relation to the Cuban bolero==
The [[bolero]], as a genre of [[music in Cuba]], originated in [[Santiago de Cuba]] in the last quarter of the 19th century;&lt;ref&gt;Cristobal Diaz offers 1885: "el bolero, creado aproximadamente para 1885". Diaz Ayala, Cristobal 1999. ''Cuando sali de la Habana 1898-1997: cien años de música cubana por el mundo''. 3rd ed, Cubanacán, San Juan P.R. p24-25&lt;/ref&gt; it does ''not'' owe its origin to the Spanish music and song of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945].

[[File:Ustekabe txaranga eibar.jpg|thumb|right|320px|A charanga performing in a ''pasacalles''.]]
'''Charanga''' is, in several areas of [[Spain]] a name given to represent a small [[musical band]], with [[Wind instrument|wind]] and [[percussion]] instruments, which typically plays during popular [[festivals]] (mostly in northern Spain and in the [[Valencian Community]]). The musicians are often amateurs and usually travel around as different towns celebrate their festivals.

For the most part, charangas play popular, traditional songs, which have simple rhythms and often feature risqué lyrics. Also, they often play [[medley (music)|medley]]s. The most typical type of event in which they play is the ''pasacalles'', a performance which moves along the streets of a town, while the public follows the band and dances to its tunes (and have a few beers).

In the past, the name ''charanga'' was also applied to certain military musical bands.

'''Cleversticks''' is a plastic [[Construction set|construction toy]] manufactured in the UK.

== The "Cleversticks Construction System" ==
{{references|section|date=April 2015}}
The original design manufactured in [[polypropylene]] used sticks with pairs of jaws on each end and rings, the jaws connect onto the body of the sticks or rings, The jaws also connected the sticks end to end. The resulting toy was best suited to young children; with these few components a wide range of models could be assembled. Squares, triangles, rectangles and hexagon shapes were later added to allow the toy to be used for sorting into sets; the toy could now be used in primary education. Technical shapes were added to increase the complexity of the toy and appeal to older children. The most recent additions utilise the new patented design manufactured in [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) including wheels with tyres manufactured in [[Santoprene]], a synthetic rubber.

== Patent, registered design, and trademark ==
The first patent in the UK GB 8313507 has a priority date of May 17, 1983, a [[United States patent law|US patent]] No 4548590 [http://www.wikipatents.com/4548590.html]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} was granted in October 1985. The most recent UK patent GB2417434 [http://www.wikipatents.com/gb/2417434.html]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} was granted on February 24, 2009. The following registered designs have also been obtained: UK No 2066049, UK No 2106334, Ger No 40204339.1, Aus 1447/2002 and UK No 3019498. The name CLEVERSTICKS was registered under the No 1557320 [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-os/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=C&amp;trademark=1557320] as a GB trade mark in December 1993.

'''Coal Cracker''' is a [[Log flume (ride)|classic hydroflume ride]] located at [[Hersheypark]] in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]]. The ride was installed by [[Arrow Development]] in 1973, making it the oldest water ride at Hersheypark still in daily operation. It has a unique layout, due to the terrain features of this part of the park.

Riders are seated in {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} boats for the three and a half minute ride along a water channel over {{convert|2000|ft|m|adj=on}} long.&lt;ref name="Guidebook"&gt;Hershey's Guidebook, Western Publishing Company, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the [[fiberglass]] boat has ascended the first lift hill, riders are only {{convert|55|ft|m}} off the ground. A second lift carries riders above the Twin Turnpike ride, preparing them for the final 35-degree, {{convert|49|ft|m|adj=on}} drop. Riders' [[photograph]]s are taken midway through the drop. The Coal Cracker shares space with several newer rides, including the [[SooperDooperLooper]] (built in 1977) and the [[Great Bear (roller coaster)|Great Bear]] (1998).

The water supply for the ride is pumped through pipes connected to a {{convert|14000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} man-made lake. This lake has the capacity to store {{convert|100000|gal|l|adj=on}} of water, and the pump system can handle approximately {{convert|25000|gal|l|adj=on}} a minute.&lt;ref name="Guidebook"/&gt; Guests are loaded into the boats from a revolving turntable; as the boats are always in motion this permits a higher ride capacity while providing more stability during loading and unloading.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatadventurehistory.com/Hydro%20Flume.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal Cracker ride photos are produced and sold by Get The Picture Corporation.

The Coal Cracker ride is not in operation during fall and winter events at Hersheypark, such as ''Hersheypark in the Dark'' and ''Christmas Candylane''.

Coal Cracker is also the name of a youth-led newspaper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2016/05/31/community-reporting/|title=Community Reporting|date=2016-05-31|website=American Libraries Magazine|access-date=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania|Mahanoy City, PA]]. It was founded in 2013 by Krista Gromalski, a Co-Founder of Heron's Eye Communications who had previously edited [[Milford Magazine]] in [[Milford, Pennsylvania|Milford, PA]] with Publisher [[Sean Strub]]. In August 2016 Coal Cracker youth-led news expanded into a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization called Coal Cracker Kids with a mission to empower young people of Pennsylvania’s [[Anthracite|Anthracite Coal]] Region through youth-led projects that explore sense of place and promote professional development. In February 2017 Coal Cracker Kids took ownership of the former Mahanoy City Lumber &amp; Supply Company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://republicanherald.com/news/student-newspaper-moves-into-mahanoy-city-home-1.2228443|title=Student newspaper moves into Mahanoy City home|last=Pytak|first=By Stephen J.|access-date=2017-09-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; with plans to renovate the building for use as its headquarters.

The '''Comic Book Collecting Association''', or CBCA, is an organization dedicated to promoting the hobby of comic book collecting. Its membership is composed of collectors, dealers, and other comic book enthusiasts. It is modeled after other hobbyist organizations such as the [[American Philatelic Society]] and the [[Universal Autograph Collectors Club]].&lt;ref&gt;"Comic Book Collecting Association Launched",  ''Scoop'', February 24, 2010, "[http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/public/default.asp?t=1&amp;m=1&amp;c=34&amp;s=259&amp;ai=92141]", March 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The CBCA is a not-for-profit corporation registered in the State of California.

==History==
The Comic Book Collecting Association was created in December 2009 by the members of another organization, now defunct, the [[Network of Disclosure]] (NOD). The Network of Disclosure was a group whose members pledged to disclose any restoration or enhancement on comic books that they sold. The members of NOD voted on December 12, 2009 to change the name and mission statement of the organization to reflect the much broader goal of promoting education, fellowship, and ethics within the hobby. As a result, the Network of Disclosure ceased to exist and the Comic Book Collecting Association was created.&lt;ref&gt;"Comic Book Collecting Association Launched",  ''Scoop'', February 24, 2010, "[http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/public/default.asp?t=1&amp;m=1&amp;c=34&amp;s=259&amp;ai=92141]", March 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The CBCA was publicly announced on February 22, 2010 on several comic book-related websites and publications. The organization has members in the United States and in several other countries.

==Aims==
The Comic Book Collecting Association is a non-profit international organization made up of comic book enthusiasts who share an appreciation for the history, artistic merit, and significance of the comic book medium as an important element of popular culture.  The aim of the CBCA is to promote the comic book art form and hobby of comic book collecting for people of all ages by encouraging fellowship among comic book enthusiasts, providing information and education to the public, and helping to facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of comic books and related material.&lt;ref&gt;Mission Statement, ''Comic Book Collecting Association'', "[http://www.comiccollecting.org]", March 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Uncanny136.jpg|thumb|right|Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men'' #136 (August 1980, art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]), the penultimate issue of the "[[Dark Phoenix]]" saga.  [[Jean Grey]] would sacrifice herself in the following issue, but [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] later had the story [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] to allow Jean to appear in the new ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' series.]]
In the [[comic book]] fan community, the apparent [[death]] and subsequent return of a long-running [[Character (arts)|character]] is often called a '''comic book death'''. A comic book death is generally not taken seriously by readers and is rarely permanent or meaningful other than for story or thematic purposes.

==Context==
Commenting on the impact and role of comic book character deaths, writer [[Geoff Johns]] said:&lt;ref&gt;IGN Geoff Johns: Inside Blackest Night&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Death in superhero comics is cyclical in its nature, and that's for a lot of reasons, whether they are story reasons, copyright reasons, or fan reasons.}}

The phenomenon of comic book death is particularly common for superhero characters. Writer [[Danny Fingeroth]] suggests that the nature of superheroes requires that they be both [[ageless]] and [[immortality|immortal]].&lt;ref&gt;James R. Fleming, [http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v2_2/reviews/fleming.shtml Review of ''Superman on the Couch: What Superheroes Really Tell Us about Ourselves and Our Society''], ''ImageTexT: Interdisciplinary Comics Studies'', vol. 2, no. 2, Winter 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common expression regarding comic book death was once "The only people who stay dead in comics are [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], [[Jason Todd]], and [[Uncle Ben]],"&lt;ref name="opinionjournal2007"&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110009780 Captain America, RIP], para. 5, ''Wall Street Journal'', March 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the seminal importance of those characters' deaths to the title character:  [[Captain America]]'s [[sidekick]] (retconned dead in 1964), Batman's second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (dead in 1988), and [[Spider-Man]]'s uncle (dead since 1962), respectively. This long-held tenet was broken in 2005, when Jason Todd returned to life as the [[Red Hood (Jason Todd)|Red Hood]] and Bucky was reported to have survived the accident that seemingly killed him, brought back in 2005 as the [[Winter Soldier (comics)|Winter Soldier]], remaining in the shadows for decades. Barnes apparently died again in 2011 after a short tenure as Captain America,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Fraction, Matt]]|penciller=[[Immonen, Stuart]]|inker=von Grawbadger, Wade|story=Chapter 3: The Hammer That Fell On Yancy Street|title=Fear Itself|issue=3|date=August 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to be revived by [[Nick Fury]]'s Infinity Formula.&lt;ref&gt;''Fear Itself'' #7.1 (2011), Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because death in comics is so often temporary, readers rarely take the death of a character seriously—when a character dies, the reader feels very little sense of loss, and simply left wondering how long it will be before they return to life.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/comic-book-deaths/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbr.com/the-most-memorable-shocking-comic-book-deaths/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/logan-how-handled-death-comic-books-981835&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.se/books?id=raV6qalYZKwC&amp;pg=PA194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
Although several comic book deaths are well-known, two of the best-known are the 1980 "death" of [[Jean Grey]] in Marvel's "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix Saga]]" and that of [[Superman]] in [[DC Comics|DC]]'s highly publicized 1993 "[[The Death of Superman|Death of Superman]]" storyline. There is one major distinction between the two, however—whereas it was never intended that Superman's death be permanent, but rather that he would return to life at the conclusion of the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/03/29/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-96/| title = Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed # 96| author = Brian Cronin| date = March 29, 2007| publisher = Comic Book Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean's passing was intended to be permanent, as the editor [[Jim Shooter]] felt that would be the only satisfactory outcome given that she had committed [[mass murder]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Dark Phoenix Tapes", ''Phoenix: The Untold Story'' #1 (April 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ginocchio|first=Mark|title=10 Amazing Storylines Derailed by Editorial Politics|url=http://whatculture.com/comics/10-amazing-comic-storylines-derailed-editorial-politics.php/8|work=What Culture|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the story was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] a few years later to facilitate Jean's return.

In 2007, the death of [[Captain America]] made real-world headlines&lt;ref name="opinionjournal2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/comics-captain-america-1941-2007-95787&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=2934283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/08/books/08capt.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/08/usa.arts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18520433&lt;/ref&gt; when he met his apparent end, but Steve Rogers returned in ''[[Captain America: Reborn]]'' in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/06/15/captain.america/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/captain-america-steve-rogers-coming-back-life-years-marvel-comics-killed-article-1.376815&lt;/ref&gt;

==In universe acknowledgement==
Comic book characters themselves have made comments about the frequency of resurrections. [[Professor X]] has commented "in mutant heaven there are no pearly gates, but instead revolving doors."&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #70 page 17, panel 1&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Siryn]] was made aware of [[Banshee (comics)|her father]]'s death, she refused to [[Mourning|mourn]] him, giddily claiming that since her father has died as an [[X-Men|X-Man]], he was likely going to be soon resurrected, shocking her friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[David, Peter]] (w), [[Olivetti, Ariel]] (a). "Two Meetings, One In Person, One Not", ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (vol 3) #7 (July 2006). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father is later restored to life but is recruited by the [[Apocalypse Twins]] as part of their new [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' #9 (June 2013). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The obituary writer of the in-universe newspaper the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' once bemoaned to reporter [[Ben Urich]] about how many retractions he has had to write after each resurrection of a superhero or [[supervillain]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Unlimited'' vol.1 #18. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cupid and Death''''' is a mid-seventeenth-century [[masque]], written by the [[Literature in English#Caroline and Cromwellian literature|Caroline]] era dramatist [[James Shirley]], and performed on 26 March [[1653 in literature|1653]] before the Portuguese ambassador to Great Britain. The work and its performance provide a point of contradiction to the standard view that the England of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]] was uniformly hostile to stage drama.&lt;ref&gt;A History Of Western Music by Donald Jay Grout (First Published 1962 (UK) by J.M. Dent &amp; Sons Ltd, London) - Chapter 10: The Mature Baroque: Vocal Music - p318 ''"Masques continued to be given privately throughout the period of the Civil war (1642 - 49), the Commonwealth (1649 - 60) and the early years of the Restoration of Charles II (reg. 1660 - 85). The most elaborate of these private entertainments was Cupid and Death (1653)..."''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After the [[closure of the theatres in 1642]] at the start of the [[English Civil War]], Shirley earned a living as a schoolteacher. As part of his new occupation, he wrote dramas &amp;mdash; morality plays and masques &amp;mdash; for his students to perform. The final works of his career, including ''[[Honoria and Mammon]]'' and ''[[The Contention of Ajax and Ulysses]]'' (both published in 1659), were works for student performers. ''Cupid and Death'' is another work in this category, though its resemblances with the great masques of the late [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] Court have been noted by critics &amp;mdash; it "is much more like a Court Masque than any of Shirley's other school Masques".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Dent, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps this aspect of the work made it seem appropriate for the Portuguese ambassador, the Count of Peneguiaõ. Shirley's past Royalist connections with the Stuart Court, and even his [[Roman Catholicism]], clearly (if surprisingly) did not stand as insuperable obstacles to a public staging of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Clare, pp. 153-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
''Cupid and Death'' was first published in [[book size|quarto]] in 1653, by the booksellers John Crook and John Baker. It was reprinted in [[1659 in literature|1659]]. The full musical score for the masque, by [[Matthew Locke (composer)|Matthew Locke]] and [[Christopher Gibbons]], has survived, and was published together with Shirley's text in a modern edition in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;By Edward J. Dent, in ''Musica Britanica,'' Vol. 2 (1951).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
The drama depends on a traditional tale, found in [[Aesop]] and many subsequent versions. For his source, Shirley employed a [[1651 in literature|1651]] translation of Aesop by [[John Ogilby]], with whom he'd worked at the [[Werburgh Street Theatre]] in the later 1630s. Shirley wrote [[commendatory verse]]s for Ogilby's volume.

==Plot==
In the tale and in Shirley's retelling, Death and Cupid accidentally exchange their arrows and cause chaos as a result. Cupid shoots potential lovers and inadvertently kills them. Death shoots at elderly people whose time of passing has come, and strikes them ardent instead; he shoots duellists about to fight, and they drop their swords to embrace and dance and sing. The "serious" portion of the masque features the kind of personifications standard in the masque form: Nature, Folly, Madness, and Despair. As usual in masques of Shirley's era, the work contains a comic anti-masque, with a tavern Host and a Chamberlain, and a dance of "[[Satyr]]s and Apes." (The poor Chamberlain is struck by Death with Cupid's arrow, and falls in love with an ape.) The god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] eventually intervenes to set things right; Cupid is banished from the courts of princes to common people's cottages (a suitably sober moral for the [[Puritan]] regime then in power). The slain lovers are shown rejoicing in [[Elysium]].

"''Cupid and Death'' resembles Caroline masque in its use of staging, music, dance, singing and dialogue. Yet it differs in that the masquers take part in the action and they do not dance with the audience at the end...The balance between spoken prose dialogue, recitative and song carries the performance away from masque and towards [[opera]], a form [[William Davenant|Davenant]] planned to introduce to the London stage as early as 1639."&lt;ref&gt;Corns, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cupid and Death'' was performed at [[Rutland Boughton]]'s Glastonbury Festival in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; by the Consorte of Musicke (notably [[Anthony Rooley]] and [[Emma Kirkby]]) in 1985, and by the [[Halastó Kórus]] (directed by [[Göttinger Pál]]) in Budapest in 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8903">[[File:Efsilandrover.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Efsi Matchbox sized Land Rover 'Red Cross'.]]
'''Efsi''' was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] company making [[Die-cast toy|diecast]] cars and trucks starting in 1959 under the '''Bestbox''' name. The company could be considered the [[Matchbox Toys]] of the Netherlands, but its origins and purpose as a government sponsored employer was far less commercial than other toy manufacturers. Efsi was based in Heerlen, the [[Netherlands]], which is located in southern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg province]].

==History==
In 1959 (some sources say 1962), Bestbox started making simple diecast cars in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg province]] (Bickford 2009). The Dutch Wiki site reports that in the 1960s, the coal mines in Limburg closed. Some significant post-mining industries where workers relocated were automobile producers DAF and Nedcar in Born. After the closure, [[DSM (company)| DSM]] (The Dutch State Mines) tried providing new employment to out-of-work or disabled miners in different shops or factories. These 'WIM' workshops (Workshop for Disabled Miners) were backed by a national Fund for Social Institutions (FSI). 

One of the activities was to continue the production of Best-box models. Later the name was changed to EFSI, apparently a phonetic pronunciation of FSI (EFSI Dutch Wiki page; see also EFSI Made in Holland, 2010–2011). The Bestbox name was discontinued in 1971, perhaps because of the similarity to the name (and competition) of [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] toys (Breithaupt 2001). Though similar to Matchbox, and popular locally, Efsi toys do not seem to have been too well known outside the Netherlands (Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;85). Most Efsi products were marked "Made in Holland" (as opposed to 'Made in the Netherlands') on the base.

==Typical vehicles==
===Early offerings===
[[File:Efsi - B.R.M. F1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|B.R.M. Formula 1 race car. This car, in the F1 series was the first to be made by Efsi. Previously they had been sold under the "Bestbox" label - a name reminiscent of "Matchbox".]]
Among EFSI's first vehicles were a set of 1960s [[Formula One cars]] including [[Ferrari]], [[Brabham]], [[Honda]], [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]], and [[Maserati|Cooper Maserati]] (Breithaupt 2001; Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;85). These were first marketed under the Best Box name and had realistic engines, thick black tires and realistic, solid appearing, deep-set wheels. Several other vehicles were also marketed under the Best Box label, like a Citroen Dyan sedan. Another popular line were a very [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]]-like series of diecast bodied [[Ford Model T]] vehicles in various forms including coupe, sedan, pickup, delivery van, delivery van in fire engine livery (with ladder), tanker, and wrecker truck. Some Model T versions had diecast bases, but plastic bodies. Overall, these were simple but attractive models, produced since the Best Box days, then later cast with the Efsi name up to about 1980 or beyond.  The Model T delivery van was made in several liveries like Harrod's, Cadbury, and George Travis wholesale confectioner. Even later, many Efsi vehicles were closely duplicated by Spain's [[Auto Pilen]] (Bras 2012a; Bras 2012b; Breithaupt 2001).
[[File:Bestbox2512citroendyane.JPG|thumb|300px|An early Best Box Citroen Dyane sedan. Note the simple unadorned plastic wheels. Note the strangely shaped headlights.]]
Other cars, like a [[Jaguar XKE|Jaguar XKE convertible]],  [[BMW]] coupe, and a [[Citroën DS]] ambulance were also made. Many EFSI cars were a bit smaller than those made by [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] and some dies seemed very close to Matchbox - like the [[Mercedes-Benz 280]] convertible and a Mercedes-Benz flat bed truck. One earlier [[Ford Transit]] van casting appears similar to one made by Zylmex around 1990, so EFSI appears to have participated in the common practice of buying tooling and also selling it to companies in other countries.

===HO trucks===
Many Efsi dies were made by a company in [[Portugal]], though models themselves were made in the Netherlands (Efsi-toys 2006). In the 1980s, EFSI became known for its HO scale truck and bus lines. Early trucks were Dutch [[DAF trucks | DAFs]] but a Mercedes-Benz cab (long and short wheelbase) and a [[Commer]] van were also common (Bickford 2009; Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;97). Varied liveries were seen, often of Dutch or mainland European products like [[Philips]], [[KLM]] airlines, [[Miele]] appliances, Intertrans Freight Logistics, and Libeltex nonwoven materials (EFSI Made in Holland, 2010–2011; Johnson 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;65–66; Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;97). Other international companies like Exxon Escorenes, Pirelli, Hurlimann Beer, Chiquita Bananas, and Safeway Foods were also done. One truck, a FIAT van with sliding side door was often seen with automobile ads (FIAT or Citroen) or with Police or 'Gendarmerie', according to language. Just as often, though, trucks were produced clean, without any livery at all. One bus, a [[VDL Bova | Bova Futura]], was made in at least 15 different liveries.

Early trucks were produced with a basic unadorned black wheel design, while later ones incorporated a triangular chrome wheel that looked a lot like a Majorette design. Packaging in the 1980s was simple as trucks were held in flimsy plastic containers with an EFSI identification sticker on the lower side of the container. Later, more design and color was incorporated on a cardboard blister, but, still, the presentation was simpler than more developed diecast companies - no printing was usually seen on the back of the blister card. One interesting aspect of packaging was the eight sided STOP sign in red seen on the blister packages for EFSI Toys. The sign, which says "code" right next to it, seems to be a warning that the toy is unsafe for children under a certain age. Most EFSI toys were stamped 'Holland' or 'Made in Holland'. Blister packs for smaller trucks and cars were variously marked as Efsi RevWheels, Efsi Toppers, or Efsi Plus (Bras 2012a).

==Holland Oto==
Around 1988, apparently when the disabled miner program was discontinued, the company name was changed to '''Holland Oto''', which is still in operation, making contemporary models of trucks, buses, and agricultural vehicles (Bickford 2009, Holland-Oto Miniaturen 2010). Today, Holland-Oto is headquartered in [[Weert]], just southeast of [[Eindhoven]], but north of the Heerlen home of the former Efsi establishment in Limburg. While earlier Efsi packaging was either white or yellow or some combination of the two, the Holland Oto vehicles were generally the same products, but now in a blue and orange package (Bras 2012a).

Holland Oto had connections with Dutch AHC, and thus today has connections to the JOAL and [[Auto Pilen|Pilen]] enterprises in Spain (Breithaupt 2001). For example, in 1980, Pilen S.A. introduced new vehicles. These were the former Model Ts rebadged and some of the typical Efsi HO trucks - though re-engineered by Pilen with that company's considerable talent for diecast refinement (Bras 2012b). Besides Joal, today Holland-Oto is affiliated with or owns Universal Hobbies, Motorart diecast cars and construction vehicles, HiSpeed diecast classic vehicles, and Kids' Globe Farming toys (Holland-Oto Miniaturen 2010).

The '''Ernie Awards''' are [[Australia]]n awards for comments deemed misogynistic.

It is named after former [[Australian Workers' Union]] secretary Ernie Ecob, who was known for his misogynistic remarks. One of his best-known remarks was "Women aren't welcome in the shearing sheds. They're only after the sex," which is why there is a sheep on top of the Gold Ernie.&lt;ref name="Mondo"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/thingo/txt/s1180534.htm Meredith Bergmann of the Ernie Awards] [[Mondo Thingo]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The inaugural awards night was in celebration of him resigning from the [[Labor Council of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="WO87"&gt;[http://workers.labor.net.au/87/a_guestreporter_alison.html What’s Wrong With The Ernies] Workers Online, [[Labor Council of New South Wales]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A dinner is held for 300 women each year&lt;ref name="Mondo"/&gt; and the winner is determined by the person who receives the most booing when their sexist statement or action is read out.&lt;ref name="SheikFeizWins"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Sheikh-wins-gong-for-sexist-comments/2005/08/12/1123353483833.html Sheikh wins gong for sexist comments] [[The Age]], 12 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of categories have featured, such as the Gold Ernie, the Warney (for sport, named after [[Shane Warne]]), the Media Ernie, the Political Ernie, the Judicial Ernie, the Anon (for boys behaving better, formerly called the Gareth after [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]]&lt;ref name="WO152"&gt;
[http://workers.labor.net.au/152/c_tradeshall_ernie.html The Importance of Being Ernie] Workers Online, [[Labor Council of New South Wales]]&lt;/ref&gt;), the Elaine (for females making comments unhelpful to the [[Sisterhood (feminism)|sisterhood]], named after [[Elaine Nile]]&lt;ref name="WO152"/&gt;) and the Trump (for repeat offenders).&lt;ref name="Mondo"/&gt;  The categories of offenders have changed over the years, according to [[Meredith Burgmann]].&lt;ref name="SheilasMockersOckers"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/11/australia.gender Sheilas put the mockers on ockers] [[The Observer]], 11 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemorations==

1909, the 50th anniversary of the publication of ''On The Origin of Species'' and the 100th anniversary of Darwin's birth, saw several major events celebrating both. At [[Cambridge]], more than 400 scientists and dignitaries from 167 countries met in a widely reported event of public interest to honour Darwin's contributions and discuss the latest discoveries and ideas related to evolution,&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Darwin Centennial Celebration (1959)]] had a major, well publicised event from 24–28 November at the [[University of Chicago]].

In 2009, the [[BBC]] aired [[BBC Darwin Season]], a series of television and radio programs, to celebrate Darwin's bicentenary and the 150th anniversary of the publication of ''the Origin''.

'''''Fifty Shades of Grey''''' is a 2011 [[Erotic romance novels|erotic romance novel]] by British author [[E. L.

Fifty Shades Of Grey is crazy similar to its Twilight origin story|last=Eakin|first=Marah|work=News|access-date=2017-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first instalment&lt;!-- Do not change this to "installment", it is correct in British English --&gt; in the [[Fifty Shades trilogy|''Fifty Shades'' trilogy]] that traces the deepening relationship between a college graduate, Anastasia Steele, and a young business magnate, Christian Grey. It is notable for its explicitly erotic scenes featuring elements of sexual practices involving [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]]/[[Discipline (BDSM)|discipline]], [[Dominance and submission|dominance/submission]], and [[Sadomasochism|sadism/masochism]] ([[BDSM]]). Originally [[Self-publishing|self-published]] as an [[ebook]] and a [[print-on-demand]], publishing rights were acquired by [[Vintage Books]] in March 2012.

''Fifty Shades of Grey'' has topped best-seller lists around the world, selling over 125 million copies worldwide by June 2015. It has been translated into 52 languages, and set a record in the United Kingdom as the fastest-selling paperback of all time. Critical reception of the book, however, has tended towards the negative, with the quality of its prose generally seen as poor. [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Focus Features]] produced a [[Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|film adaptation]], which was released on 13 February 2015&lt;ref name=Variety&gt;{{cite news|title=Universal Shifts '50 Shades' Release Date to February 2015|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/universal-shifts-50-shades-release-date-to-february-2015-1200826341/ |work=Variety|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also received generally unfavourable reviews.

The second and third volumes of the trilogy, ''[[Fifty Shades Darker]]'' and ''[[Fifty Shades Freed]]'', were published in 2012. ''[[Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian]]'', a version of ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' being told from Christian's point of view, was published in June 2015.

==Plot==
Anastasia "Ana" Steele is a 21-year-old college senior attending [[Washington State University Vancouver|Washington State University]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]]. Her best friend is Katherine "Kate" Kavanagh, who writes for the college newspaper. Due to an illness, Kate is unable to interview 27-year-old Christian Grey, a successful and wealthy [[Seattle]] entrepreneur, and asks Ana to take her place. Ana finds Christian attractive as well as intimidating. As a result, she stumbles through the interview and leaves Christian's office believing it went poorly. Ana does not expect to meet Christian again, but he appears at the hardware store where she works. While he purchases various items including cable ties, masking tape, and rope, Ana informs Christian that Kate would like some photographs to illustrate her article about him. Christian gives Ana his phone number. Later, Kate urges Ana to call Christian and arrange a photo shoot with their photographer friend, José Rodriguez.

The next day José, Kate, and Ana arrive for the photo shoot at the [[Heathman Hotel]], where Christian is staying. Christian asks Ana out for coffee and asks if she is dating anyone, specifically José. Ana replies that she is not dating anyone. During the conversation, Ana learns that Christian is also single, but he says he is not romantic. Ana is intrigued but believes she is not attractive enough for Christian. Later, Ana receives a package from Christian containing first edition copies of ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', which stuns her. Later that night, Ana goes out drinking with her friends and ends up [[drunk dialing|drunk dialling]] Christian, who informs her that he will be coming to pick her up because of her inebriated state. Ana goes outside to get some fresh air, and José attempts to kiss her, but he is stopped by Christian's arrival. Ana leaves with Christian, but not before she discovers that Kate has been flirting with Christian's brother, Elliot. Later, Ana wakes to find herself in Christian's hotel room, where he scolds her for not taking proper care of herself. Christian then reveals that he would like to have sex with her. He initially says that Ana will first have to fill in paperwork, but later goes back on this statement after making out with her in the elevator.

Ana goes on a date with Christian, on which he takes her in his helicopter, ''Charlie Tango'', to his apartment. Once there, Christian insists that she sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] forbidding her from discussing anything they do together, which Ana agrees to sign. He also mentions other paperwork, but first takes her to his playroom full of [[BDSM]] toys and gear. There, Christian informs her that the second contract will be one of [[dominance and submission]], and there will be no romantic relationship, only a sexual one. The contract even forbids Ana from touching Christian or making eye contact with him. At this point, Christian realises that Ana is a [[Virginity|virgin]] and takes her virginity without making her sign the contract. The following morning, Ana and Christian again have sex. His mother arrives moments after their sexual encounter and is surprised by the meeting, having previously thought Christian was [[homosexual]], because he was never seen with a woman. Christian later takes Ana out to eat, and he reveals that he lost his virginity at age 15 to one of his mother's friends, Elena Lincoln, and that his previous dominant/submissive relationships failed due to incompatibility. Christian also reveals that in his first dominant/submissive relationship he was the submissive. Christian and Ana plan to meet again, and he takes Ana home, where she discovers several job offers and admits to Kate that she and Christian had sex.

Over the next few days, Ana receives several packages from Christian. These include a laptop to enable her to research the BDSM lifestyle in consideration of the contract; to communicate with him, since she has never previously owned a computer; and to receive a more detailed version of the dominant/submissive contract. She and Christian email each other, with Ana teasing him and refusing to honour parts of the contract, such as only eating foods from a specific list. Ana later meets with Christian to discuss the contract and becomes overwhelmed by the potential BDSM arrangement and the potential of having a sexual relationship with Christian that is not romantic in nature. Because of these feelings, Ana runs away from Christian and does not see him again until her college graduation, where he is a guest speaker. During this time, Ana agrees to sign the dominant/submissive contract. Ana and Christian once again meet to further discuss the contract, and they go over Ana's [[Limits (BDSM)|hard and soft limits]]. Christian spanks Ana for the first time, and the experience leaves her both enticed and slightly confused. This confusion is exacerbated by Christian's lavish gifts and the fact that he brings her to meet his family. The two continue with the arrangement without Ana's having yet signed the contract. After successfully landing a job with Seattle Independent Publishing (SIP), Ana further bristles under the restrictions of the non-disclosure agreement and her complex relationship with Christian. The tension between Ana and Christian eventually comes to a head after Ana asks Christian to punish her in order to show her how extreme a BDSM relationship with him could be. Christian fulfils Ana's request, beating her with a belt, and Ana realises they are incompatible. Devastated, she breaks up with Christian and returns to the apartment she shares with Kate.

==Background and publication==
[[File:E. L. James (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|E. L. James in 2012]]
The ''Fifty Shades'' trilogy was developed from a [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'']] [[fan fiction]] series originally titled ''Master of the Universe'' and published episodically on fan-fiction websites under the pen name "Snowqueen's Icedragon". The piece featured characters named after [[Stephenie Meyer]]'s characters in ''Twilight'', [[Edward Cullen]] and [[Bella Swan]].  After comments concerning the sexual nature of the material, James removed the story from the fan-fiction websites and published it on her own website, FiftyShades.com. Later she rewrote ''Master of the Universe'' as an original piece, with the principal characters renamed Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele and removed it from her website before publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= Media bistro |url=http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine/50128?red=as|title=The Lost History of ''Fifty Shades of Grey''|author=Boog, Jason|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer commented on the series, saying "that's really not my genre, not my thing... Good on her—she's doing well. That's great!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1685954/fifty-shades-of-grey-stephenie-meyer.jhtml|title= ''Fifty Shades of Grey'': Stephenie Meyer Speaks Out|publisher=MTV|date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This reworked and extended version of ''Master of the Universe'' was split into three parts. The first, titled ''Fifty Shades of Grey'', was released as an e-book and a [[print on demand]] paperback in May 2011 by The Writers' Coffee Shop, a virtual publisher based in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/17/50-shades-of-grey-a-self-published-e-book-is-the-future-of-publishing.html#url=/articles/2012/03/17/50-shades-of-grey-a-self-published-e-book-is-the-future-of-publishing.html '50 Shades of Grey,' a Self-Published E-Book, Is the Future of Publishing].

The Writers' Coffee Shop had a restricted marketing budget and relied largely on book blogs for early publicity, but sales of the novel were boosted by word-of-mouth recommendation. The book's erotic nature and perceived demographic of its fan base as being composed largely of married women over thirty led to the book being dubbed "Mommy Porn" by some news agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/business/media/an-erotic-novel-50-shades-of-grey-goes-viral-with-women.html?_r=2 | title= Discreetly Digital, Erotic Novel Sets American Women Abuzz| work= [[The New York Times]]| date= 20 March 2012| first=Julie| last=Bosman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news| first =Jenna | last = Goudreau|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/03/19/will-fifty-shades-of-grey-make-mommy-porn-the-next-big-thing/|title= Will ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' Make 'Mommy Porn' The Next Big Thing?| work= Forbes |date= 19 March 2012| accessdate= 7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has also reportedly been popular among teenage girls and college women.&lt;ref name= Forbes /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/books/fifty-shades-of-grey-author-el-james-reveals-reallife-secrets-to-her-readers-16180814.html|title=''Fifty Shades of Grey'' author EL James reveals real-life secrets to her readers | work =[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|date=4 July 2012|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Doree | last=Lewak |authorlink=Doree Lewak | url = http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/the_hot_sex_text_zx2AW5DO7h40whfZSHG1kO | title = The hot sex text | work =[[New York Post]] |date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the release of the final volume in January 2012, news networks in the United States had begun to report on the ''Fifty Shades'' trilogy as an example of [[viral marketing]] and of the rise in popularity of female erotica, attributing its success to the discreet nature of [[E-book reader|e-reading devices]].&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/03/14/erotic-novel-50-shades-grey-unites-women-unnerves-some-men/| title= Erotic novel ''50 Shades of Grey'' unites gals, unnerves some guys|publisher=Fox News|date=14 March 2012|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Meredith|last=Bennett-Smith|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2012/0315/50-Shades-of-Grey-What-is-the-appeal|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|title=''50 Shades of Grey'': What is the appeal?|date=15 March 2012|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the heightened interest in the series, the license to the ''Fifty Shades'' trilogy was picked up by [[Vintage Books]] for re-release in a new and revised edition in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Bosman.

Andy Lewis. ''The Hollywood Reporter''. 16 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The attention that the series has garnered has also helped to spark a renewed interest in [[erotic literature]]. Many other erotic works quickly became [[Best Sellers (New York Times)|best-sellers]] following ''Fifty Shades''{{'}} success, while other popular works, such as [[Anne Rice]]'s ''[[The Sleeping Beauty Quartet|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' trilogy, have been reissued (this time without pseudonyms) to meet the higher demand.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/story/2012-08-29/erotica-trend-fifty-shades-of-grey/57416594/1|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130412043721/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/story/2012-08-29/erotica-trend-fifty-shades-of-grey/57416594/1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 April 2013|title=Publishing world is turned on by 'Fifty Shades of Grey'|work=[[USA Today]]|date=29 August 2012|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2012, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] UK announced that it had sold more copies of ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' than it had the entire ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series combined, making E. L. James its best-selling author, replacing [[J. K.

===Critical response===
It has received mixed to negative reviews, with most critics noting poor literary qualities of the work. [[Salman Rushdie]] said about the book: "I've never read anything so badly written that got published.

===Controversy===

''Fifty Shades of Grey'' has attracted criticism due to its depictions of [[BDSM]], with some BDSM participants stating that the book confuses BDSM with abuse and presents it as a pathology to be overcome, as well as showing incorrect and possibly dangerous BDSM techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Velvet, Lady. (14 February 2015) [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifty-shades-grey-a-dominatrixs-773577 'Fifty Shades of Grey': A Dominatrix's View (Guest Column)]. Hollywood Reporter. Retrieved on 27 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/16/fifty-shades-of-grey-isnt-bdsm_n_6684808.html 'Fifty Shades Of Grey' Isn't A Movie About BDSM, And That's A Problem]. Huffingtonpost.com (16 February 2015). Retrieved on 27 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with the release of the book and its surprising popularity, injuries related to BDSM and [[sex toy]] use spiked dramatically. In 2012, the year after the book was published, injuries requiring Emergency Room visits increased by over 50% from 2010 (the year before the book was published). This is speculated to be due to people unfamiliar with both the proper use of these toys and the safe practice of [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and other "kinky" sexual fetishes attempting what they had read in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Sex Toy Injuries Surged after 'Fifty Shades of Grey's was Published | first1= Christopher | last1= Ingraham | newspaper= The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/10/sex-toy-injuries-surged-after-fifty-shades-of-grey-was-published/}} 10 February&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been criticism against the fact that BDSM is part of the book. Archbishop Dennis Schnurr of Cincinnati said in an early February 2015 letter, "The story line is presented as a romance; however, the underlying theme is that bondage, dominance, and sadomasochism are normal and pleasurable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2015/02/12/fifty-shades-of-grey-is-an-assault-on-marriage-say-bishops/ Fifty Shades of Grey is an ‘assault on marriage’, say bishops]. CatholicHerald.co.uk (12 February 2015). Retrieved on 27 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Feminism|feminist]] [[Opposition to pornography|anti-pornography]] organisation [[Stop Porn Culture]] called for a boycott of the movie based on the book because of its sex scenes involving bondage and violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/12-news/2015/02/13/12-news-bishop-50-shades-of-grey-is-a-sin/23389421/ Bishop: Seeing '50 Shades of Grey' is a sin].

Several critics and scientists have expressed concern that the nature of the main couple's relationship is not [[BDSM]] at all, but rather is characteristic of an abusive relationship. In 2013, social scientist Professor Amy E. Bonomi published a study wherein the books were read by multiple professionals and assessed for characteristics of [[intimate partner violence]], or IPV, using the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC's]] standards for emotional abuse and sexual violence. The study found that nearly every interaction between Ana and Christian was emotionally abusive in nature, including stalking, intimidation, and isolation. The study group also observed pervasive sexual violence within the CDC's definition, including Christian's use of alcohol to circumvent Ana's ability to consent, and that Ana exhibits classic signs of an abused woman, including constant perceived threat, stressful managing, and altered identity.&lt;ref name="pmid23931257"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=Altenburger|first2=Lauren E.|last3=Walton|first3=Nicole L.|date=September 2013|title="Double crap!"

A second study in 2014 was conducted to examine the health of women who had read the series, compared with a control group that had never read any part of the novels. The results showed a correlation between having read at least the first book and exhibiting signs of an [[eating disorder]], having romantic partners that were emotionally abusive and/or engaged in stalking behaviour, engaging in [[binge drinking]] in the last month, and having 5 or more sexual partners before age 24. The authors could not conclude whether women already experiencing these "problems" were drawn to the series, or if the series influenced these behaviours to occur after reading by creating underlying context.&lt;ref name="pmid25144515"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=Nemeth|first2=Julianna M.|last3=Altenburger|first3=Lauren E.|last4=Anderson|first4=Melissa L.|last5=Snyder|first5=Anastasia|last6=Dotto|first6=Irma|date=August 2014|title=Fiction or not?

Dr. Drew commented that the book was "horribly written" in addition to being "disturbing" but stated that "if the book enhances women's real-life sex lives and intimacy, so be it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtop.com/267/2874733/Erotic-best-seller-disturbing-violent|title=Dr. Drew: ''50 Shades of Grey'' pathological, poorly written |publisher=[[WTOP-FM]]|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship===
In March 2012, branches of the public library in [[Brevard County, Florida]], removed copies of ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' from their shelves, with an official stating that it did not meet the selection criteria for the library and that reviews for the book had been poor. A representative for the library stated that it was due to the book's sexual content and that other libraries had declined to purchase copies for their branches.&lt;ref name="LJBan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwartz|first=Meredith|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2012/05/managing-libraries/florida-county-pulls-fifty-shades-of-grey-from-shelves/|title=Florida County Pulls ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' From Shelves|work=[[Library Journal]]|date=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah Caldwell-Stone of the [[American Library Association]] commented that "If the only reason you don't select a book is that you disapprove of its content, but there is demand for it, there's a question of whether you're being fair.

'''''Florence''''' is an [[interactive story]] and [[video game]] developed by the Australian studio Mountains and published by [[Annapurna Interactive]]. The game was released on February 14, 2018 ([[Valentine's Day]]) for [[iOS]] and on March 14, 2018 for [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. In ''Florence'', the player follows the story of 25-year-old Florence Yeoh as she lives her daily routine and meets Krish, a [[cellist]] she sees in the park. The game features little written dialogue and tells Florence's story through a series of brief chapters. The game uses basic puzzles to reinforce pieces of Florence's life as players progress through her story.

Lead designer Ken Wong wanted to create games that eschewed [[violent video games|violence]] and was inspired by his work on ''[[Monument Valley (video game)|Monument Valley]]'' to have a more narrative-focused experience that included puzzles. The game received favorable reviews that praised the game's art-style, music, and narrative structure.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Florence Screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|''Florence'' shows the awkwardness of a first date through a puzzle minigame. As Florence becomes more comfortable talking with Krish, the puzzles become easier.&lt;ref name="sydney" /&gt;]]
''Florence'' is divided into 20 chapters, each featuring a different portion of Florence Yeoh's life.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; The chapters are separated into six acts, which represent different portions of Florence's growth and change. The game plays out linearly, requiring input from the player in the form of short [[minigame]]s which help mimic or reveal Florence's thoughts and actions.&lt;ref name="rollingstone"&gt;{{cite web |title='Florence' Is a Short, Bittersweet and Relatable Tale About First Love |author=Fogel, Stefanie |date=February 19, 2018 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/florence-interview-w516887 |accessdate=March 18, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320105545/https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/florence-interview-w516887 |archivedate=March 20, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="destructoid" /&gt; These games include: Florence brushing her teeth, Florence following the sound of a cello to find Krish, Krish cleaning his room before Florence visits, and Florence packing up her things when Krish moves in—and giving Krish's things back to him when he moves out—among others. A single play-through of ''Florence'' takes approximately 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;

==Plot==
The game follows Florence Yeoh, a 25-year-old woman who lives alone and is settled into a monotonous routine of working at her job and mindlessly interacting with social media on her commute.&lt;ref name="eurogamer" /&gt; One morning, her phone dies and she follows the sound of a cello and sees Krish, a [[street performance|street performer]], for the first time.&lt;ref name="eurogamer" /&gt; Krish befriends her and they go out on some dates.&lt;ref name="eurogamer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gameofthemonth" /&gt; They kiss for the first time and begin to take their relationship more seriously. Krish moves in with Florence and is pushed by her to follow his dreams of being a great cellist. As a thank you, Krish gives Florence a painting set and Florence fantasizes about following her passion of being an artist.&lt;ref name="destructoid" /&gt;

The couple have their first fight six months later at a grocery store.&lt;ref name="thevergereview" /&gt; After a year, the two have fallen into a routine and begin to drift apart.&lt;ref name="eurogamer" /&gt; After another fight, Krish moves out. Florence decides to quit her job and follow her painting passion, where she finds success.&lt;ref name="destructoid" /&gt;

After hiring staff, Mountains had no direction on what kind of game they wanted to create.&lt;ref name="MCV" /&gt; Wong's approach was to first hire the team and then come up with a solid game.&lt;ref name="MCV" /&gt; The staff discussed how film and books regularly explored love and human emotions, but that it was missing from game design and it would be a "good challenge."&lt;ref name="MCV" /&gt; They opted to move forward and create ''Florence''.&lt;ref name="MCV" /&gt; It was the first game Wong had worked on since ''Monument Valley''.&lt;ref name="cnbc"&gt;{{cite web |title=The designer of 'Monument Valley' has a new game where users explore relationships, without prizes or big thrills |author=Findling, Deborah |date=February 11, 2018 |publisher=[[CNBC]] |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/09/designer-of-monument-valley-has-a-new-game-where-users-explore-relationships.html |accessdate=March 18, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330012652/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/09/designer-of-monument-valley-has-a-new-game-where-users-explore-relationships.html |archivedate=March 30, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developers wanted to make the game a linear experience early on in the process because of a concern that people with more life experience would make the "correct" choices and avoid the moral of the game.&lt;ref name="apptrigger"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview: Ken Wong, and breaking with what a game ‘should be’ in Florence |author=Valentine, Rebekah |date=February 2018 |publisher=''App Trigger'' |url=https://apptrigger.com/2018/02/12/ken-wong-game-florence/ |accessdate=March 29, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330013023/https://apptrigger.com/2018/02/12/ken-wong-game-florence/ |archivedate=March 30, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mountains was inspired by the way people consume other media for the emotional connections they bring, and wanted to bring that feeling to video games.&lt;ref name="cnbc" /&gt; The team decided to use music as a substitute for dialogue throughout the game, with the cello representing Krish while the piano follows Florence.&lt;ref name="radar"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fall in love with Florence, the new game from Monument Valley's designer |author=Weber, Rachel |date=February 14, 2018 |publisher=''[[Games Radar]]'' |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/fall-in-love-with-florence-the-new-game-from-monument-valleys-designer/ |accessdate=March 18, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328102420/https://www.gamesradar.com/fall-in-love-with-florence-the-new-game-from-monument-valleys-designer/ |archivedate=March 28, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mountains used musical themes for the characters after accidentally creating them during development of the "Groceries" chapter, where Krish and Florence have their first fight.&lt;ref name="apptrigger" /&gt; Wong chose the name Florence as she was designed to be a [[Chinese Australian]] whose parents picked an "old fashioned name" for their daughter when they immigrated.&lt;ref name="radar" /&gt;

[[Image:O violeiro, 1899.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;''Violeiro'' playing, by Almeida Júnior.&lt;br&gt;The [[viola caipira]] is a [[Brazil]]ian folk instrument.&lt;/center&gt;]]
A '''folk instrument''' is a [[musical instrument]] that developed among common people and usually does not have a known [[inventor]]. It can be made from [[wood]], [[metal]] or other material. Such an instrument is played in performances of [[Traditional music|folk music]].

==Overview==
The instruments can be percussion instruments, or different types of [[flute]]s or [[trumpet]]s, or string instruments that are plucked, hammered or use a form of  [[Bow (music)|bow]]. 

Some instruments are referred to as folk instruments because they commonly appear in folk music, even though they do not meet the criteria defining a folk instrument; an example is the [[harmonica]].

Pearson Education Ltd. p157&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first associated with Paul Garvin in the 1960s, who used it as a translation of the [[Czech (language)|Czech]] ''aktualisace'' (literally "to actualise"), borrowing the terms from the [[Prague school]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Procházka (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c9a9nhXQUKEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Prague%20School%20and%20Theories%20of%20Structure&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Prague School and Theories of Structure]'' p.196 footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of foregrounding: [[parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and deviation. Parallelism can be described as unexpected regularity, while deviation can be seen as unexpected irregularity.&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. (1969) ''A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry''. Longman&lt;/ref&gt; As the definition of foregrounding indicates, these are relative concepts. Something can only be unexpectedly regular or irregular within a particular context. This context can be relatively narrow, such as the immediate textual surroundings (referred to as a 'secondary norm'&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;) or wider such as an entire genre (referred to as a 'primary norm'&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;).

For example, the last line of a poem with a consistent metre may be foregrounded by changing the number of syllables it contains. This would be an example of a deviation from a secondary norm. In the following poem by [[E. E. Cummings]],&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in Wales, K. (2001) ''Dictionary of Stylistics'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; there are two types of deviation:

:light’s lives lurch

:a once world quickly from rises

:army the gradual of unbeing fro{{Clarify|date=June 2016}}

:on stiffening greenly air and to ghosts go

:drift slippery hands tease slim float twitter faces

:Only stand with me, love! against these its

:until you are, and until i am dreams...

Firstly, most of the poem deviates from 'normal' language (primary deviation). In addition, there is secondary deviation in that the penultimate line is unexpectedly different from the rest of the poem. [[Nursery rhyme]]s, adverts and [[slogan]]s often exhibit parallelism in the form of repetition and [[rhyme]], but parallelism can also occur over longer texts. For example, jokes are often built on a mixture of parallelism and deviation. They often consist of three parts or characters. The first two are very similar (parallelism) and the third one starts out as similar, but our expectations are thwarted when it turns out different in end (deviation).

Foregrounding can occur on all levels of language&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, p (2004) "Stylistics, A Resource Book". London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; ([[phonology]], [[graphology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]]). It is generally used to highlight important parts of a text, to aid memorability and/or to invite interpretation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4224">The '''Greek Film Critics Association''' or '''Pan-Hellenic Film Critics Association''' ({{lang-el|Πανελλήνια Ένωση Κριτικών Κινηματογράφου, ΠΕΚΚ}}) was founded in 1976. The first members were the famous Greek film critics such as [[Nino Fenek Mikelidis]], [[Vasilis Rafailidis]], [[Yannis Bakogiannopoulos]] and others. Since 1977, the association belongs to [[International Federation of Film Critics]] (FIPRESCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ίδρυση|url=http://www.pekk.gr/index.php/profile/istoriko|publisher=Πανελλήνια Ένωση Κριτικών Κινηματογράφου|accessdate=4 January 2014|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nearly every year, the PEKK gives out awards during [[Thessaloniki International Film Festival]]. The [[Greek Film Critics Association Awards]] is one of the most important awards for the Greek cinema. The PEKK gives also out award during [[Drama Short Film Festival|Short Film Festival]] in [[Drama, Greece|Drama]].

}}
A '''Guitaro''' is an [[autoharp]] constructed to be held like a [[guitar]].  

[[Oscar Schmidt]] manufactured Guitaros in the 50s through the early 70s, attempting to take advantage of the guitar's popularity in the [[American folk music revival|folk music revival]] of that era.  Other sellers commonly sold them with their own brand names but most or all resellers still called them a Guitaro.

[[File:Guitaro In Use.jpg|thumb|right|The Guitaro design allows use of a shoulder strap, much like a guitar.  Note that finger picks are used by this player.]]
The Guitaro's strings are longer than used on medium-sized or larger autoharps, resulting in a lower tone than usual.  The instruments have 15 chord bars, and have fewer strings than most medium or larger sized autoharps, all of which somewhat limits their versatility.  Like other autoharps, either [[fingerpicks]] or a [[plectrum|flatpick]] can be used. [[Sara Carter]] played a Guitaro in some performances, and videos can still be found online showing her playing one.

In 1964, the "Guitaro" was introduced by Oscar Schmidt-International. Designed by Glen Peterson and Henry Ruckner, the instrument came in two models. One sported a resonator and had a soundhole in its back; the other had the soundhole in the front and no resonator. The resonator model was dropped in the early 70s.&lt;ref&gt; [U.S. Patent #3,237,503. Issued March 1, 1966]. Source: The Autoharp Book by Becky Blackley i.a.d. Publications; Brisbane, California. First published in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Nilson Langseth''' (July 14, 1846 – November 10, 1927) was a [[Norwegian Americans|Norwegian-American]] who held the record for the world's longest [[beard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-beard-male |title=Longest beard - male |work=[[Guinness World Records]] |accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Langseth was born in [[Eidsvoll]] and emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1867. He married Anna Berntsen in 1870 and worked as a farmer in [[Elkton Township, Clay County, Minnesota]]. In his later life, he traveled around the United States as part of a [[freak show]] showing off his beard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Parker (writer) |year=1983 |title=The World's Most Fantastic Freaks |location=London |publisher=[[Octopus Publishing Group]] |page=96 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=lddNAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Langseth died aged 81 in [[Wyndmere, North Dakota]] and is buried in Elk Creek Church Cemetery in [[Kensett, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Longest Whiskers |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4092909/hans_langseth_18461927/ |newspaper=The Greene Recorder |date=November 23, 1927 |page=7 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=January 21, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he died, his beard measured {{convert|5.33|m|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/magasinet/2003/11/12/383312.html |last=Glendrange |first=Sølvi |date=November 12, 2003 |title=Rekord for rekordbok |newspaper=[[Dagbladet]] |publisher=Labrador CMS |language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was donated to the Department of Anthropology at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Hunt |editor-first=David R. |editor-link=David R.

The person who drops the "frozen walrus carcass" then becomes the "frozen walrus carcass" and must be passed around the ring.

}}
The '''James S. Brady Press Briefing Room''' is a small theater in the [[West Wing]] of the [[White House]] where the [[White House Press Secretary]] gives briefings to the [[news media]] and the [[President of the United States]] sometimes addresses the press and the nation. It is located between the workspace assigned to the [[White House press corps]] and the office of the Press Secretary.

==History==
The first presidential press conference was held on 15 March 1913 in the Oval Office, during the presidency of [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Subsequently, through to 1969, communications from the President and general press news conferences took place in various locations, including the [[Indian Treaty Room]], the [[Harry S Truman Building|State Department auditorium]], and the White House [[East Room]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehousehistory.org/presidential-press-conferences|title=Presidential Press Conferences|publisher=whitehousehistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1969, to accommodate the growing number of reporters assigned to the White House, President [[Richard Nixon]] had the indoor swimming pool, which had been installed by the [[March of Dimes]] for [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], covered and turned into press offices and a lounge that could double as a briefing room.&lt;ref name=cbsn&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Dan|title=Bush, Media Bid Press Room Farewell|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/02/national/main1860355.shtml|accessdate=2012-05-09|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=August 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Robert P.|title=Life in the White House: A Social History of the First Family and the President's House|year=2004|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=84|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FDjeFogvUy4C&amp;pg=PA84|via=[[Google Books]]|isbn=9780791460986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2000, the room was renamed the "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room" in honor of [[James Brady]], the press secretary who had been shot and permanently disabled during an [[Reagan assassination attempt|assassination attempt]] on President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;

===Renovation===
In December 2005, the White House announced the intention to renovate the aging Press Briefing Room and cramped press corps offices.&lt;ref name=tbclo&gt;{{cite news|last=Vande Hei|first=Jim|title=White House Press Room To Be Closed For Makeover|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/26/AR2005122600591.html|accessdate=May 9, 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 2, 2006, the final briefing was held, and [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] hosted several previous press secretaries at a closing ceremony and there was some hesitation and concern about whether the press would be allowed to return to the White House.&lt;ref name=abcn&gt;{{cite news|last=Yellin|first=Jessica|title=White House Press Briefing Room Redo|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=2265587&amp;page=1#.T6s0po5c9Fg|accessdate=May 9, 2012|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=August 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=presnyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Stolberg|first=Sheryl Gay|title=White House Evicts Press, Temporarily. No, Really.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/washington/03westwing.html?ref=washington|accessdate=May 9, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim, the [[White House Conference Center]] was used as temporary location for press conferences.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

President Bush reopened the renovated room in a ribbon-cutting ceremony on the morning of July 11, 2007. He held his first formal press conference in the new briefing room the next day, following the release of a report on the progress of the Iraqi government.&lt;ref name=reu&gt;{{cite news|last=Spetalnick|first=Matt|title=Bush to Press: Welcome back. No questions, Please|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/07/11/us-bush-press-idUSN1023978320070711|accessdate=May 9, 2012|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=July 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The modernization cost nearly US$8.5 million.  Of that sum, $2.5 million was funded by the media, and the remainder was funded by tax dollars.  Each correspondent's seat was priced at $1,500. Beneath the current press room lies the former White House swimming pool that has since become a computer [[server room]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The White House Staff: Inside the West Wing and Beyond |publisher=[[Brookings Institution Press]] |year=2002 |first=Bradley Hawkes |last=Patterson |isbn=9780815769514 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Worse Than Watergate: The Secret Presidency of George W. Bush]] |first=John W. |last=Dean | authorlink=John W. Dean |year=2005 |publisher=Hardie Grant Publishing |page=69 |isbn=9781740662222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most noticeable change to the briefing room was a different backdrop for the press conferences, which now featured a softly lit screen flanked by mock [[column]]s, instead of the previous blue curtain.  The new [[podium]] contained video screens for [[teleconferencing]] and [[multimedia]] displays. For safety reasons, the trapdoor which provided access to the old swimming pool (a popular stop for visitors) was replaced by a discreet staircase.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8215">'''Kharabeesh''' ({{lang-ar|خرابيش}} {{IPA-ar|xaraːbiːʃ|}}) is a [[Jordan]]-based company that produces [[Arabic]]-language animated cartoons, music videos and talk shows that generally tackle political issues in the [[Arab world]]. The top four most-viewed Kharabeesh videos posted on YouTube have more than 2 million views. All views feature either [[Housni Mubarak]] or [[Muammar Gaddafi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://toons.kharabeesh.com/&lt;/ref&gt; "Karabeesh" means "scribbles" in Arabic. The political cartoons produced by Kharabeesh have received international attention during and after the [[Arab Spring]] revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/conversation-kharabeesh-cartoons-13265449&lt;/ref&gt;

Kharabeesh is part of Think Arabia, a media group that “aims to be a leading creative production, technology and publishing company for the new media platforms in the region and the world."&lt;ref&gt;http://thinkarabia.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Founding===
Kharabeesh was co-founded by Jordanian blogger Wael Attili, Mohammad Asfour and Wafa Nabulsi, in 2008. Their aim was to produce satirical animated videos and distribute them solely through new media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gilimag.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=143:kharabeesh&amp;catid=34:fun&amp;Itemid=53&lt;/ref&gt; Attili traces the genesis of the idea for Kharabeesh to 2005-2006, when the founders felt that there was “a lack and a need for Arabic content” in the world of social media and online videos. Initially operating out of a small office in [[Jabal Amman]], [[Amman]], Kharabeesh has now grown to become an open space where illustrators, animators, designers work collaboratively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Creative Lab|title=Kharabeesh Tour|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrxOameTkEY|work=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; A profile of Kharabeesh and Attili in the magazine Jordan Business writes that "Attili brought together his college buddies, who were all struggling to manage their own slew of start-ups in the web industry, and decided to form Kharabeesh." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tarawnah|first=Nasim|title=Kharabeesh: Creativity Unbound|journal=Jordan Business|date=May 2011|pages=42–44}} http://www.jordan-business.net/images/stories/May%202011/Kharabeesh.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

The founders of Kharabeesh originally decided to orient their content along political themes that are salient for most Arabs, as opposed to cultural and social issues that are distinct to each individual country. The Kharabeesh founders also felt that the internet and online media were the ideal platforms on which to tackle these issues, offering more freedom of expression than was available in traditional print media, in which the "ceiling of freedom" is much lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Creative Lab|title=Kharabeesh Tour|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrxOameTkEY|work=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was initially launched, Kharabeesh, and in order to create a sustainable group of companies to be able to serve each other and form a new concept of partnership in the Arab world, each partner merged their own start-ups in the tech and web fields to create a mother company called Think Arabia with other two partners, Firas Otaibi and Shaher Otaibi. In doing so, Kharabeesh was able to outsource its web and graphic design services to the sister companies in order that each company would in turn assist the others' financial viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tarawnah|first=Nasim|title=Kharabeesh: Creativity Unbound|journal=Jordan Business|date=May 2011|pages=42–44}} http://www.jordan-business.net/images/stories/May%202011/Kharabeesh.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab Spring===
Although Kharabeesh was active before the [[Arab Spring]], the popularity of their political videos during the wave of revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, and elsewhere in the Arab world pushed the company to a new level of recognition. The popularity of the political cartoons in particular was such that a Tunisian television channel volunteered to translate a video about the flight of deposed Tunisian President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]] from Arabic to Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gilimag.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=143:kharabeesh&amp;catid=34:fun&amp;Itemid=53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission===
Currently Kharabeesh CEO, Attili has said that the Kharabeesh script-writing and animation team draws “inspiration from our personal, everyday experiences ... using them to power our sketches and cartoons … That’s what makes them so appealing to people.”&lt;ref&gt;http://twofour54.com/creativelab/en/article/inspire/kharabeesh-the-process-of-creativity.html&lt;/ref&gt; Attili is one of Jordan's longest-active bloggers, having begun blogging in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tarawnah|first=Nasim|title=Kharabeesh: Creativity Unbound|journal=Jordan Business|date=May 2011|pages=42–44}} http://www.jordan-business.net/images/stories/May%202011/Kharabeesh.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Attili maintains that Kharabeesh was built out of the idea that “a new creative industry was emerging in the Arab world," and that secret of Kharabeesh's success lies in its emphasis on creativity rather than profit. Although the company sometimes takes individual commissions from clients, most of its work is generated in-house and involves testing the success of ideas in order to determine if potential buyers are interested.  According to Attili, creation and execution come before business and funding, saying that the company values “new, funny and edgy mini-cartoon shows designed specifically for the wed audience.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tarawnah|first=Nasim|title=Kharabeesh: Creativity Unbound|journal=Jordan Business|date=May 2011|pages=42–44}} http://www.jordan-business.net/images/stories/May%202011/Kharabeesh.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent features and animations==

Kharabeesh's cartoons have been compared to [http://www.jibjab.com/originals JibJab],&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/conversation-kharabeesh-cartoons-13265449&lt;/ref&gt; not only because of their political nature but also their animation style and technique. Kharabeesh shares their techniques on a [https://www.youtube.com/user/KharabeeshWorkshop "KharabeeshWorkshop" channel on YouTube].

===''“Mubarak is high”''===

Between January 30, 2011 and February 1, 2011, Kharabeesh released two animated shorts depicting then Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]] addressing the Egyptian people following the ousting of Tunisian President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]]. In the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCBFHo0_PPA first animated video] of the series, which as of April 8, 2012 has over 1,800,000 views on YouTube, Housni Mubarak addresses the Egyptian people in [[Egyptian Colloquial Arabic]], a clear departure from the public speeches he had recently given at the time, which were noted to have been delivered solely in [[Modern Standard Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com.hk/blogs/johnson/2011/01/egypt&lt;/ref&gt; The caricatured Mubarak offers trivial solutions to the Egyptian people and pledges not to leave his position, before punched off his podium by a fist representing "the People." In the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv8CED3jr1A&amp;feature=relmfu second video] of the series, Mubarak addresses an angry mob, ignoring their chants demanding that he step down. A week later, Kharabeesh launched the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbyg2Ej1uDY&amp;feature=relmfu third and final video] of the series, which shows Mubarak receiving phone calls of congratulations from his counterparts abroad.

Kharabeesh has also produced videos satirizing Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdd_vnyxk0Q&lt;/ref&gt; the Egyptian [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg40cCdZP4U&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muammar Gaddafi]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzHNt5gUG0g&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market Value==
According to a statement by Wael Attili to the [[Saudi]] channel [[Al Arabiya]] in 2011, the company's market value is between 7 and 8 million dollars.

[[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] created by novelist [[Ian Fleming]] in 1953. Bond is a British secret agent working for [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] who also answers to his codename, 007. He has been [[James Bond filmography|portrayed on film]] by actors [[Sean Connery]], [[David Niven]], [[George Lazenby]], [[Roger Moore]], [[Timothy Dalton]], [[Pierce Brosnan]] and [[Daniel Craig]], in twenty-six productions. All the films but two were made by [[Eon Productions]]. Eon now holds the full adaptation rights to all of [[James Bond novels|Fleming's Bond novels]].&lt;ref name="Poliakoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shprintz:Variety" /&gt;

In 1961 producers [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] joined forces to purchase the filming rights to Fleming's novels.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=5}} They founded the production company Eon Productions and, with financial backing by [[United Artists]], began working on ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', which was directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] and featured Connery as Bond.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=43}} Following ''Dr. No''{{'}}s release in 1962, Broccoli and Saltzman created the holding company [[Danjaq]] to ensure future productions in the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' film series]].&lt;ref name="Danjaq v Sony" /&gt; The series currently encompasses twenty-four films, with the most recent, ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', released in October 2015. With a combined gross of nearly $7 billion to date, the films produced by Eon constitute the [[List of highest-grossing film series|fourth-highest-grossing film series]], behind the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], ''[[Star Wars]]'', and [[Wizarding World]] films.&lt;ref name="Numbers franchises" /&gt; Accounting for the effects of [[inflation]] the Bond films have amassed over $14 billion at current prices.{{efn|Prior to the release of ''Skyfall'' in 2012, the James Bond series had grossed approximately $12.5 billion at 2011 prices;&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; after factoring in earnings of almost $2 billion from ''Skyfall'' and ''Spectre'', the series has earned at least $14 billion adjusted for inflation.}} The films have won five [[Academy Awards]]: for [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Sound Effects]] (now Sound Editing) in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' ([[37th Academy Awards|at the 37th Awards]]), to [[John Stears]] for [[Academy Award for Visual Effects|Visual Effects]] in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' ([[38th Academy Awards|at the 38th Awards]]), to [[Per Hallberg]] and [[Karen Baker Landers]] for [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Sound Editing]], and to [[Adele]] and [[Paul Epworth]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Original Song]] in ''Skyfall'' ([[85th Academy Awards|at the 85th Awards]]), and to [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]] and [[Jimmy Napes]] for Original Song in ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' ([[88th Academy Awards|at the 88th Awards]]). Additionally, several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Original Song]], including [[Paul McCartney]]'s "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]", [[Carly Simon]]'s "[[Nobody Does It Better]]" and [[Sheena Easton]]'s "[[For Your Eyes Only (Sheena Easton song)|For Your Eyes Only]]". In 1982, Albert R. Broccoli received the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]].&lt;ref name="54th Oscars" /&gt;

When Broccoli and Saltzman bought the rights to existing and future Fleming titles, it did not include ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'', which had already been sold to producer [[Gregory Ratoff]], with the story having been [[Casino Royale (Climax!)|adapted for television]] in 1954. After Ratoff's death, the rights were passed on to [[Charles K.

Bond is captured when he reconnoitres Goldfinger's plant and is drugged unconscious; Goldfinger then transports Bond to his Kentucky stud farm where he holds Bond captive. Bond escapes briefly to witness Goldfinger's meeting with US mafiosi, observing secretly as Goldfinger presents to the gangsters his plans to rob Fort Knox by using materials they have smuggled to him and later kills them to avoid paying issues.

[[Radio drama|Radio daytime drama]] serials were broadcast for decades, and some expanded to television. These dramas are often referred to as "soaps", a shortening from  "[[soap opera]]". That term stems from the original dramatic [[Serial (radio and television)|serials]] broadcast on radio that had [[soap]] manufacturers such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Colgate-Palmolive]], and [[Lever Brothers]] as sponsors &lt;ref name=Bowles-118/&gt; and producers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.proctergambleproductions.com/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These early radio serials were broadcast in weekday daytime slots when mostly housewives would be able to listen; thus the shows were aimed at and consumed by a predominantly female audience.&lt;ref name=Bowles-118&gt;Bowles, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ollantay''''' is a dramatic play, originally written in the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] language.  It is considered by some to be of [[Incan]] origin---and as such the oldest and deepest expression of Quechua literature---while others believe it to be of colonial Hispanic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, Brokaw, V.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known manuscript of ''Ollantay'' belonged to the priest [[Antonio Valdés]] (18th century), who for some time was thought to be the original author; however, other differing manuscripts have been found that suggest the existence of a common, more remote, origin.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, Brokaw&lt;/ref&gt;  The most widely accepted theory is that the story is of Incan origin and was preserved through oral tradition until it was adapted for theatrical presentation in colonial times.

''Ollantay'' was first published in 1857 by [[Johann Jakob von Tschudi]], in Quechua and German.  The first Spanish version appeared in Lima in 1868, published by [[José Sebastián Barranca]] and subtitled "The tribulations of a father and the generosity of a king" (''Los rigores de un padre y la generosidad de un rey''); since then different versions have been published in a variety of languages.

==Possible authors==

It was first assumed that Antonio Valdés, priest of [[Sicuani]], was the author of ''Ollantay''.  English historian [[Clements R. Markham]] proposed this in the 19th century, and many others assumed it to be correct, including Dr. [[Raúl Porras Barrenechea]].  However, this theory of authorship has two major shortcomings: (1) there is no direct documentation indicating such an origin; (2) Valdés is not known to have written any other piece of literature or any other historical work.  It seems more likely that this priest's contribution was limited to simply copying decaying manuscripts that he encountered in La Paz or other cities.

It was also suggested that the author was Justo Pastor Justiniani, but evidence later surfaced indicating that he served only as a copyist.  Similarly, [[Juan Espinoza Medrano]] (aka El Lunarejo), a celebrated mestizo writer of the 17th century, was also considered a possible author.  The lack of any documentary evidence supporting these possibilities has been taken to indicate a more likely pre-colonial origin for the play.

==Three hypotheses for its origin==
Three hypotheses have emerged regarding the origin of ''Ollantay'':
*Incan hypothesis:
*Hispanic hypothesis:
*Hispanic-Incan hypothesis:

==Copies of Ollantay==
There are six original copies of this play. One is from around 1770 and attributed to the priest Antonio Valdés, and is held in the Convent of Santo Domingo in [[Cuzco]], Peru.  Two are believed to be derived from this one, written by Dr. Justo Pastor Justiniani and Justo Apu Sahuaraura Inca, and held in the [[General Archive of the Nation of Peru]] and the [[National Library of Peru]], respectively.  Two others are found in the Dominican Convert of Cuzco, and the third was published by [[Johann Jakob von Tschudi]] on the basis of a manuscript with origins in [[La Paz]], Bolivia.

==Structure==
''Ollantay'' is divided into three acts. It is written predominantly in [[octosyllable]] verse alternating with [[hendecasyllable]] verse, and contains both blank verse and assonant rhyme.

==Plot summary==
A general of the Incan armies, Ollantay is a warrior of commoner origin that has been decorated and elevated to the nobility in return for his service to the empire.  He falls in love with Cusi Coyllur (or Kusi Quyllur, "happy star"), the daughter of the Inca ruler [[Pachacuti|Pachacutec]], but this love is prohibited due to his commoner background.  Nevertheless, blinded by love, he pursues a secret relationship with Cusi Coyllur, a secret shared only with the Queen Ccoya Anahuarqui.

Despite ominous omens from the Incan high priest, Ollantay decides to ask the Incan king for his daughter's hand.  Pachacutec, reminding Ollantay of his humble origins, reproaches Ollantay for his audacity and angrily expels him from the court.  Cusi Coyllur is then imprisoned in the [[Acllahuasi]] ("house of chosen women") where she is to expiate her sins; there she gives birth to a baby girl, fruit of her love with Ollantay, that she names Ima Sumac ("how beautiful").

Ollantay, on learning that Cusi Coyllur is no longer in the palace, believes that she has been murdered and decides to leave the imperial capital Cusco together with his servant and confidant Piqui Chaqui ("flea foot").  He threatens to one day return and destroy Cusco, then flees to the city which carries his name, [[Ollantaytambo]], where he and his followers arm themselves and prepare for battle.

The Incan ruler Pachacutec orders his general Rumi Nawi ("Stone-eyed") to gather forces and march to confront Ollantay. Ollantay sends his general Orqo Waranka ("A thousand mountains") to ambush Rumi Nawi in a mountain pass, defeating Rumi's forces but allowing him to escape.  Other battles ensue.  Ten years later Pachacutec dies without having defeated Ollantay, and his son [[Tupac Yupanqui]] succeeds him.

Meanwhile, in the Acllahuasi, Cusi Coyllur has endured hardship at the hands of Mama Caca ("Stone Mother") but also found an ally in Pitu Salla ("Twinned Love"), who has raised Cusi's daughter Ima Sumac as her own.  When Ima accidentally discovers her true heritage, she proposes to go to the new Incan king and ask for clemency for her mother.

At the same time, new Incan ruler Tupac Yupanqui resolves to finally defeat and capture Ollantay, and sends Rumi Nawi, who promises to redeem his earlier failure.  Rumi Nawi employs a deceptive plan: he presents himself at the gates of Ollantaytambo covered in wounds, pretending that the new Incan ruler has abused him and suggesting that he would like to join Ollantay's rebellion.  When the gates are opened, Rumi Nawi's men capture Ollantay, Orqo Waranka, and other rebels without resistance, eventually bringing them to Cusco to face Tupac Yupanqui's judgement.  After consultation with his advisors and his generals, Tupac condemns the prisoners to death, but then reverses himself at the last minute and not only pardons them, but decides to give them high-ranking posts in the empire.  Ollantay is named the senior general and deputy of the Inca ruler, while Orqo Waranka is named ruler of the state of [[Antisuyu]].

Soon afterwards, Ima Sumac enters the imperial palace to ask for clemency for her imprisoned mother.  Although Tupac doesn't yet know whom this is, he takes an interest in the case and together with Ollantay goes to the Acllahuasi.  There they find a woman with very long hair and a ghostly appearance that Tupac finally recognizes as his sister in a moment of [[anagnorisis]].  Cusi Coyllur tells her story, and a magnanimous Tupac Yupanqui frees her and immediately gives her hand to Ollantay, ending the Incan drama on a happy note.

'''Pietro Ghislandi''' (born 19 April 1957 in [[Bergamo]]) is an Italian actor.

==History==
He was introduced to the public as a [[ventriloquist]] and was a finalist in the 1986/87 edition of the [[RaiUno]] program [[Fantastico 7]] with his dummy Sergio. In 1985 he worked as a stand-in for [[Renato Pozzetto]] in the movie ''[[È arrivato mio fratello]]''. Immediately after, he had a small part in ''Grandi magazzini'' and performed in many commercials. In 1987 in ''Soldati – 365 all’alba,'' he played a gay recruit. Thanks to his expressive skills and to his surreal acting, similar to the already mentioned [[Renato Pozzetto]], Ghislandi has been often been asked to play roles as character actor, working both in the cinema and on television, without until recently getting lead roles. He boasts roles in important films like ''Il muro di gomma'' of [[Marco Risi]], ''I mitici – Colpo gobbo a Milano'' of [[Carlo Vanzina]], ''Vajont'' and ''[[Porzûs]]'' of [[Renzo Martinelli]] and, recently, was one of the actors chosen by [[Leonardo Pieraccioni]] in his successful movies (''Il principe e il pirata'', ''Il paradiso all’improvviso'' and ''Ti amo in tutte le lingue del mondo'').
Pietro Ghislandi is known to the general public for being the one and only Italian ventriloquist. His comic quality is a bit fanciful and nonstandard for television cabaret comedy. Voice is an  important element of his show entitled “The left ventriculus” that is on tour through Italy. His “vocal” experiences include the well-known cartoonist [[Bruno Bozzetto]] and the dubbing of the most famous characters of the Italian “Walt Disney”. He is also known for his roles in two national commercials. (''Acqua Uliveto'' with [[Alessandro Del Piero]] and ''Caffè Kimbo'' with [[Gigi Proietti]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3918">'''Prince Frank Littler''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (25 July, 1901-1973) born '''Prince Frank Richeux''', was an English theatre proprietor, [[impresario]] and television executive.

==Life and career==
Littler was born in [[Ramsgate]], [[Kent]], in the south east of England, the elder son in the family of five children of Jules Richeux (1863–1911), a cigar importer, and his wife, Agnes May, ''née'' Paisey (b. 1874). Richeux became a theatrical proprietor, leasing the Ramsgate Victoria Pavilion from 1906, while Agnes Richeux leased the Artillery Theatre, Woolwich, from 1909. After Richeux's death, his widow married, in 1914, the theatre manager Frank Rolison Littler (1879–1940), who adopted the five children, all of whom took his surname.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;[[Sheridan Morley|Morley, Sheridan]], [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/56657 "Littler, Prince Frank (1901–1973)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, online edition, October 2009, retrieved 5 August 2014 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The younger son [[Emile Littler|Emile]], and one of the daughters, Blanche, also went into theatrical management.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

With Blanche, Littler started a theatrical career in 1927, assembling small companies for provincial tours.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; After a stint as resident manager of his parents' theatre in Woolwich, he became an independent theatre owner in 1931, buying two theatres in [[Leicester]]. The following year he married a widow, Annie Leonora Maclachlan, an actress, professionally known as Norah Delaney. There were no children of the marriage. Over the following years he bought theatres in [[Manchester]] and [[Norwich]]. His first London productions were pantomimes at the [[London Coliseum|Coliseum]], the [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Prince's]], and [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]].&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Mr Prince Littler", ''The Times'', 14 September 1973, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Littler's [[West End theatre|West End]] shows included ''[[Glamorous Night]]'' (1936),  ''[[Brigadoon]]'' (1950); ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', (1951);  ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'' (1953, ''[[Can-Can (musical)|Can-Can]]'' (1954), ''[[The Black and White Minstrel Show]]'' and ''[[Fiddler on the Roof ]]'' (both 1966).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He presented more than 200 pantomimes in the regions, but unlike his younger brother, Emile, he played no part in writing any of his pantomimes, and concentrated wholly on the business side of the theatre.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Littler was chairman and managing director of three major theatre groups, chairman of a fourth ([[Moss Empires]]). From the beginning of commercial television in the UK, he was a major shareholder in [[Associated Television]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He was a member of the council of the Theatrical Managers' Association, and vice-president of the boards of the [[The Society of London Theatre|Society of West End Theatre Managers]], [[Denville Hall|Denville Home for Aged Actors and Actresses]] and the [[Royal Variety Charity|Variety Artistes' Benevolent Fund]].&lt;ref name=gaye/&gt; He served on the boards of the [[Royal National Theatre|South Bank Theatre]] and the [[Royal Opera House]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1957, Littler was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]].&lt;ref name=gaye&gt;Gaye, pp. 884–885&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from production in 1966, and died at his home in [[Sussex]] at the age of 72.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

A conference organised by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]], in June 2013 adopted a special treaty called "A Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities" (briefly [[Marrakesh VIP Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diplomatic Conference to Conclude a Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/vip_dc/vip_dc_8_rev.pdf|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diplomatic Conference to Conclude a Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities|url=http://www.wipo.int/dc2013/en/|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Marrakesh Treaty represents an important change in how law makers balance the demands of copyright owners against the interests of people with disabilities in particular, and a potential point of inflection in global copyright politics more generally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4325">{{Rhetoric}}
'''Pronuntiatio''' was the discipline of delivering [[Public speaking|speeches]] in Western classical [[rhetoric]]. It is one of the five canons of classical rhetoric (the others being [[inventio]], [[dispositio]], [[elocutio]], and [[memoria]]) that concern the crafting and delivery of speeches. In literature the equivalent of ancient ''pronuntiatio'' is the [[recitation]] of [[epic poetry|epics]] (Aris. Po. 26.2.).&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Lausberg, David E. Orton, R. Dean Anderson, ''Handbook of literary rhetoric: a foundation for literary study'', BRILL, 1998, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt;

As with ''memoria'', the canon that dealt with the memorization of speeches, ''pronuntiatio'' was not extensively written about in Classical texts on rhetoric. Its importance declined even more, once the written word became the focus of rhetoric, although after the eighteenth century it again saw more interest in the works of men such as [[Gilbert Austin]].

Rhetoricians laid down guidelines on the use of the voice and gestures (''actio'') in the delivery of oratory. There were instructions on the proper modulation of the voice (volume and pitch), as well as the phrasing, pace, and emphasis of speech. Also covered were the physical aspects of oration: stance, gestures, posture, and facial expressions. There was also the concept of ''exercitatio'' (or practice exercises) that enabled speakers to both memorize their speeches and practice their delivery.

This excerpt from [[Quintilian]]'s ''Institutio oratoria'' provides an example of the types of advice provided by rhetoricians:
:"The head, being the chief member of the body, has a corresponding importance in delivery, serving not merely to produce graceful effect, but to illustrate our meaning as well. To secure grace it is essential that the head should be carried naturally and erect. For a droop suggests humility, while if it be thrown back it seems to express arrogance, if inclined to one side it gives an impression of languor, while if it is held too stiffly and rigidly it appears to indicate a rude and savage temper." (''Institutio oratoria'', XI iii 68-69, translated by H. E. Butler, Loeb Classical Library, 1922)

While the content, structure, and style of oration were (and continue to be) the most important elements of oratory, effective delivery enhances its persuasive power, and poor delivery detracts greatly from its intended effect.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Delivery is based on the technology of the times.
During Cicero's time, delivery was predominantly speaking. Written delivery developed because of the written language, and now delivery is both spoken and written. Technology has taken away the distinctions between written and oral delivery.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}
 
Written discourse did not become important until reading became more common.  Because the ancients did not use punctuation, their writing consisted of one long stream of words called ''scriptio continua''.  
During the editing process, modern rhetors must go through three stages: correctness rule, formatting, and presentation.  
Writers face more problems than speakers because they must be conscious of spelling, punctuation, and grammar.  
Punctuation is useful in written discourse because it marks the end of a thought and allows the reader to pause and process the information.
Visual rhetoric focuses on images and how words function as images.
The delivery of ocular demonstration is the use of words to produce mental images in the audience.  Textual presentation allows the writer to grab the reader's attention before actually reading the text based on the appearance of the text.  The invention of word processors has allowed writers to enhance the appearance of their text and use effects to put emphasis on certain words or thoughts.
''Delivery'' refers not only to written or spoken language, but also to photographs, paintings, or movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowley|first1=Sharon|last2=Hawhee|first2=Debra|title=Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary Students|date=2004|publisher=Pearson Longman|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal situation==
Section 343 of the Criminal Code criminalises ''"Whoever, of either sex, engages habitually for gain, in sexual intercourse with others."'' The punishment is imprisonment of 6 months to 5 years and a fine.&lt;ref name="criminal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Law no 2016/007|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B599XzziGr70dnh2X2lhb1ZPbWc/view|website=Government of Cameroon|accessdate=2 March 2018|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As 'habitual' is difficult to prove, this law is rarely enforced.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; The same section also prohibits solicitation.&lt;ref name="criminal" /&gt;

Section 294 of the code criminalises ''"Whoever [[Procuring (prostitution)|procures]], aids or facilitates another person's prostitution, or shares in the proceeds of another person's prostitution, whether habitual or otherwise, or who is subsidised by and person engaging in prostitution."'' The punishment is imprisonment of 6 months to 5 years and a fine, however is there is coercion involved, a minor is involved (under 21) or if he is the manager, owner or otherwise in control of an establishment where prostitution takes place, the punishment is doubled.&lt;ref name="criminal" /&gt;

Section 361 of the code criminalised [[adultery]] for both sexes.&lt;ref name="criminal" /&gt; Married prostitutes and clients therefore both commit an offence, but this is rarely enforced.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

Law enforcement is sometimes corrupt. Sex worker report being arrested for not carrying an identification card and having to pay a bribe to be released. [[Sexual assault]]s, [[rape]] and having unprotected sex with officers to be released have also been reported.&lt;ref name="nswp" /&gt;

==HIV==
As with other [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries, [[HIV]] is a problem. Sex workers are one of the high risk groups. Access to health care and antiretroviral (ARTs) medicines for sex workers  has improved.&lt;ref name="nswp" /&gt; UNAIDs reported that in 2016 the estimated HIV prevalence amongst sex workers was 24.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV prevalence amongst sex workers |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/vc/vcshare.html?id=d9c0ff12-f62c-44e7-8e2c-dbe736bbea30 |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=22 July 2018 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, American [[biopharmaceutical]] company [[Gilead Sciences]], proposed carrying out clinical tests of a new antiretroviral drug on prostitutes in [[Douala]]. These trials were opposed, including by anti-AIDS activist group [[ACT UP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIDS drug to be tested on Cameroon's prostitutes|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-01-25/aids-drug-to-be-tested-on-cameroons-prostitutes/624876|website=ABC News|accessdate=2 March 2018|language=en-AU|date=25 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Cameroon}}
Cameroon is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Child traffickers often use the promise of education or a better life in the city to convince rural parents to give their children over to an intermediary, who then exploits the children in sex trafficking; traffickers also kidnap victims, as heightened public awareness of trafficking has led parents to be less willing to give their children to intermediaries. Sometimes relatives subject children to sex trafficking within the country. Homeless children and orphans are especially vulnerable to trafficking. Teenagers and adolescents from economically disadvantaged families are often lured to cities by the prospect of employment but are subjected to sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cameroon 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271160.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameroonian women and men are lured to Europe and other regions by fraudulent internet marriage proposals or offers of well-paying jobs, and subsequently are subjected to [[forced prostitution]]. Cameroonians from disadvantaged social strata, rural areas, and students are increasingly exploited in sex trafficking in the [[Middle East]], especially [[Kuwait]] and [[Lebanon]], as well as in [[Europe]], including [[Finland]], the [[United States]], and multiple African countries, including [[Nigeria]]. Some Cameroonian women reported being recruited for domestic work in Kuwait but sold at “slave shops” upon arrival for sex trafficking. Trafficking networks typically involve destination-country recruitment agencies that use Cameroonian intermediaries to fraudulently recruit fellow Cameroonians for work abroad. Reports suggest local awareness-raising activities targeting fraudulent recruitment have caused intermediaries to operate with greater discretion, often directing victims to travel to the Middle East through neighbouring countries, including Nigeria. Some evidence indicates Cameroonian trafficking networks in [[Morocco]] force women into prostitution. Cameroonian women also transit Morocco en route to Europe, where they are often forced into prostitution by European trafficking networks.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The government incorporated its 2011 anti-trafficking law into the penal code as Section 342-1 “Trafficking and Slavery of Persons.” The government published the penal code in French and English, the two official languages of the government. The French version defines “trafficking in persons” (“la traite de personnes”) in line with the 2000 UN TIP Protocol, whereas the English version defines “trafficking in persons” to require movement. In addition, although the English version does not define “exploitation,” its definition of “slavery in persons” does not require movement and criminalizes most forms of human trafficking. Contrary to international law, both versions require the use of threat, fraud, deception, force, or other forms of coercion in sex trafficking crimes against children. Section 342-1 prescribes penalties of 10 to 20 years imprisonment and a fine of 50,000 to one million CFA francs (FCFA) ($80 $1,608) for “la traite de personnes”/“slavery in persons.” There are enhanced penalties if the trafficking victim is 15 years old or younger, if a weapon is used, or if the victim sustains serious injuries as a result of being subjected to trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Cameroon as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cameroon 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282627.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sloppy Joe's Bar''' is a historic [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] located in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]].  The bar reopened in 2013 after being closed for 48 years.&lt;ref name="Reuters Sloppy Joe's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Once Havana's most famous bar, Sloppy Joe's reopens after 50 years|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/12/us-cuba-sloppyjoes-idUSBRE93B18620130412|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The advent of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in the United States spurred its original owner, Jose Abeal Otero, to change the emphasis from food service to liquor service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sloppy Joe's.org|url=http://www.sloppyjoes.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; when American tourists would visit Havana for the nightlife, the gambling and the alcohol they could not obtain back home. 

Sloppy Joe's welcomed tourists for over four decades, and offered over 80 cocktails in addition to the bar's own brand of 12-year-old [[rum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Havana Before Castro by Peter Moruzzi, page 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s and 1950s it was a magnet for American celebrities as well as tourists wanting to mingle with them.&lt;ref name = "LP"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z4xVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tT8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1411,2944122&amp;dq=sloppy-joes+havana&amp;hl=en "Cuba's Sloppy Joe's died and it will stay that way"], Reuters, cited at The Leader-Post, July 11, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described by the [[Los Angeles Times]] as "one of the most famous bars in the world" with "almost the status of a shrine."&lt;ref name = "LAT"&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/656595662.html?dids=656595662:656595662&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Aug+27%2C+1981&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Sloppy+Joes+Really+Sloppy+Now--and+Empty%2C+Too&amp;pqatl=google "Sloppy Joes Really Sloppy Now--and Empty, Too"], Los Angeles Times, August 27, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959 saw the bar's business nosedive, as some 90% of Sloppy Joe's clientele was American.  A fire in the 60s closed the establishment for good.&lt;ref name = "LAT" /&gt; The building in which the bar was housed remained intact, resembling a ghost town with its single-piece [[mahogany]] bar and photos of celebrities.&lt;ref name = "LP" /&gt; The slow-paced, extensive restoration, undertaken by The Office of the Historian of Havana, began in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Havana Before Castro by Peter Moruzzi|url=http://www.havanabeforecastro.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is located on the corner of Calle Animas and Zulueta in Havana Vieja ([[Old Havana]]). The building is located behind (on the same block as) the Plaza Hotel.

The bar, in its heyday, can be seen in the movie ''[[Our Man in Havana (film)|Our Man in Havana]]'' starring Alec Guinness&lt;ref name = "LP" /&gt; as it is the bar in which the character (Jim Wormold) is attempted to be recruited into the secret service.  It supposedly inspired the deli sandwich sold in northern New Jersey for over half a century by the same name, [[Sloppy joe (New Jersey)|sloppy joe]].

Renovation work on Sloppy Joe's was completed in early 2013, and its doors opened to the public on April 12th of that year.&lt;ref name="Reuters Sloppy Joe's"/&gt; The facade closely resembles the images from the 1950s, even down to the sign on the corner, above the arches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mercurynews.com|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/travel/ci_22484070/round-2-sloppy-joes-bar-havana-original}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sydney Trocadero''' was a large [[art deco]] dance and concert hall that operated between 1936 and 1971 in [[Sydney]], Australia.  It was the main venue of [[Big Band]] jazz orchestras, with the resident Trocadero Orchestra under the baton of [[Frank Coughlan]], and the All Girl Trocadero Band. Often referred to as "The Troc", it was once regarded as the "most glamorous dance palace in Sydney and accommodated up to 2,000 people".&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=Deborah|title=Scandalous Nights|journal=Inside History|date=July–August 2013|issue=17|page=58|publisher=Ben Mercer|issn=1838-5044}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the favored venue for university and school 'formals', and hosted many important local rock and pop concerts during the 1960s.

Hundreds of people thronged the pavements outside the Trocadero last night to watch the guests, many of whom were well-known cartoonists, artists, actors, models, and   radio personalities, arrive at the annual Artists' Ball.
At 10 o'clock, an hour after the dance started, about 1,500 people jostled one another on the floor.
Some dancers were in elegant evening clothes, some in street wear, but the majority wore the "fanciest" of fancy costumes that their ingenuity could devise.
Murals designed by the president of the ball committee, Mr Stanley Cross, and executed by students of the Technical College   decorated the walls.
Guests also used ingenuity in decorating the tables, one of which sprouted a row of five-foot high palm trees, another effigies of scarecrows, and a third a table-length model of an illuminated ferry-boat.
The ball was in aid of a Graphic Art Centre, where the work of creative and commercial artists can be co-ordinated.

''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' 5 November 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18134694 |title=1,500 Guests Jostle At Artists' Ball. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=5 November 1949 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
}}
The Trocadero was located on the western side of [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]], south of [[Bathurst Street, Sydney|Bathurst Street]], next door to the now demolished [[Regent Theatre (Sydney)|Hoyts Regent Theatre]].&lt;ref name=dos&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/trocadero Dictionary of Sydney - Trocadero]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6940">'''Televisión Serrana''' (TVS), is a community-based television and video collective operating in [[Sierra Maestra]] in Cuba. TVS was founded by Daniel Diez Castillo in 1993 and is located in the small town of San Pablo de Yao, in the [[Buey Arriba]] territory. This small community inhabits 32, 000 people and most are coffee growers and/or producers. The focus of TVS is to acknowledge and give voice to the farmers in the [[mountain ranges]]. TVS is preserving the culture of this small community and “connecting them to the broader cultural life of Cuba

== History ==

The project of TV Serrana began in 1993 by Daniel Diez Castillo. Castillo was a television producer in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] from The Cuban National Broadcasting Channel (ICRT). When Castillo left Havana, Cuba was in the “Periodo Especial” or [[Special Period]]. This was the economic crisis that followed after the fall of the Soviet Union. Castillo went east towards the region of the Sierra Maestra. The Sierra Maestra is known for its amazing mountains and the men who came across it. [[Fidel Castro]], [[Che Guevara]] and many other rebels organized themselves to fight against [[Fulgencio Batista]]. Due to the mountainous terrain, the Sierra Maestra  became isolated from other parts of [[Cuba]]. Before Castillo came along, the rest of Cuba portrayed Sierra Maestra as the "producers of staples; nothing was said about their dreams, their conflicts, their culture" &lt;ref&gt;Dagron,Alfonso Gumicio(2001). "Making Waves: Stories of Participatory Communication for Social Change&lt;/ref&gt;
. Daniel Diez Castillo then wanted to film the real Sierra Maestra, his goal was to “make a collective form of cinema, to produce movies and documentaries narrating the history and identity of people living that area, to create a form of partaken communication far from the capital” &lt;ref&gt;DigiMag. "Television Serrana, Mountain Network". http://www.digicult.it/digimag/article.asp?id=586. Retrieved May 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 
. TV Serrana was first funded by [[UNESCO]], but after time they were able to self-fund its own programs.

==Tools and Main Features of Television Serrana==
Tools used for Television Serrana are simple, it includes: "[[VHS]], Super VHS and Beta nonprofessional cameras and editing equipment".&lt;ref&gt;Dagron,Alfonso Gumicio(2001). "Making Waves: Stories of Participatory Communication for Social Change&lt;/ref&gt; The crew of TVS consists of “three cameramen, three directors, two editors, two producers, two sound assistants and three drivers &lt;ref&gt;Dagron,Alfonso Gumicio(2001). "Making Waves: Stories of Participatory Communication for Social Change&lt;/ref&gt; who also set up the lighting when needed. One main feature used in TVS are video letters. A video letter is a reportage that captures the people of Sierra Maestra’s experiences, lives and dreams through their own perspective. Video letters are not edited by the media, but they show the true reality and struggles of the people. Video letters are also important because they are seen by others and are used for responding. They create communication between boundaries and is a great factor in Television Serrana.

==Services Provided==
The program aims to promote self-sustaining activities, TV Serrana provides programs and opportunities to the people living within the villages. A majority of the training workshops were given through El Centro de Estudios para la Comunicación Comunitaria (CECC), created in 1996. TV Serrana along with the help of supporting institutions provides training and services through seminars that help locals with communication and community building skills through the use of media. These programs offer lessons to villagers "willing to use video in their communities as a tool for participatory development and democratic communication".&lt;ref&gt;Dagron,Alfonso Gumicio(2001). "Making Waves: Stories of Participatory Communication for Social Change&lt;/ref&gt; Other services accessible through TVS is the ability to transfer and copy video-cassettes from and to Beta VHS and [[S-VHS]] which allow people within the communities to share their stories.

==Constraints==
Television Serrana has been a growing success, but there were difficulties in the beginning. One of the problems of TVS was the lack of experience many of the crew members had. Most had to take training sessions on how to work media products and running programs within the community. As mentioned before, the trainees had to learn how to do video letters and how to transfer and copy video-cassettes to and from Beta VHS. The greatest of constraints for the project was gaining the trust and confidence needed by the local communities. Many of the villagers were skeptical of the programs intentions, which created difficulties to gain the support from locals. The people of [[Sierra Maestra]] felt the newcomers were intruding onto their land, interrupting their daily lives and thought the intentions of the crew were to give the locals a bad image. The crew had to show the people that they came with positive objectives and wanted to help the communities.

'''''The Second Shepherds' Play''''' (also known as '''''The Second Shepherds' Pageant''''') is a famous medieval [[mystery play]] which is contained in the manuscript HM1, the unique manuscript of the [[Wakefield Cycle]]. These plays are also referred to as the Towneley Plays, on account of the manuscript residing at Towneley Hall. The plays within the manuscript roughly follow the chronology of the Bible and so were believed to be a cycle, which is now considered not to be the case.&lt;ref name=LePan&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Joseph|title=The Broadview Anthology of British Literature, Concise Edition, Volume A, Second Edition|year=2012|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Canada|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This play gained its name because in the manuscript it immediately follows another [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] play involving the [[shepherd]]s. In fact, it has been hypothesized that the second play is a revision of the first.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=J. W.|title=Studies in Fifteenth-century Stagecraft|year=1991|publisher=Western Michigan University Medieval Institute|location=Kalamazoo|isbn=0918720389}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that the two shepherd plays were not intended to be performed together since many of the themes and ideas of the first play carry over to the second one.&lt;ref name=Abate&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abate|first=Michelle Ann|title=Oversight as Insight: Reading ''The Second Shepherds' Play'' as ''The Second Shepherd's Play''|journal=Early Theatre|year=2005|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA228909188&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=iuclassb&amp;it=r&amp;p=LitRC&amp;sw=w|accessdate=17 July 2012|publisher=Literature Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both plays it becomes clear that Christ is coming to Earth to redeem the world from its sins. Although the underlying tone of ''The Second Shepherd's Play'' is serious, many of the antics that occur among the shepherds are extremely farcical in nature.

==Plot==
The biblical portion of the play, a retelling of the Visitation of the Shepherds, comes only after a longer, invented story that mirrors it, in which the shepherds, before visiting the holy baby outside in a manger, must first rescue one of their sheep that has been hidden in a cradle indoors by a comically evil sheep-stealing couple. Once they have discovered and punished the thieves, the storyline switches to the familiar one of the three shepherds being told of the birth of [[Christ]] by an [[angel]], and going to [[Bethlehem]] to offer the true Child gifts.

At the start of the play, Coll, the first shepherd ("primus pastor") arrives in a field, invoking God in anachronistic terms (referring, as the shepherds will do throughout the play, to the life and death of Christ even though at this point of the play Christ has not yet been born) complaining about the (typically English) cold weather and about his poverty and the arrogance of local gentry. He begins by saying, "Lord, what these weders are cold! And I am ill happyed" which translates as "Lord [God], the weather is cold and I am ill prepared/clothed." Gib, the second shepherd, arrives without seeing Coll and complains first about the weather and then about the plight of married men, himself included, with bawdy speculation about the lives of men with more than one wife and advice to "young men of wooing" to "Be well war of weding" (wary of marriage). He paints a portrait of his wife as a loud, heavy-drinking, alternately abusive and sentimentally pious, whale-sized woman.  "By him that died for us all, I would I had run til I had lost her!" at which point he is startled by Coll. They confer about where Daw, a third, young, lazy and mischievous, shepherd, has gotten to, at which point Daw arrives complaining about employers, hunger, and about recent floods which he compares to [[Noah]]'s flood.

Mak, a local good-for-nothing and well-known thief, arrives and pretends to be a yeoman from a lord. Although they recognize him from the start, he insults and threatens them by saying that he will have them flogged. When they threaten him, he pretends not to have known who they were. Mak tries to gain sympathy from the shepherds by explaining how his wife is a lazy drunk who gives birth to too many children. Invoking Christ and Pontius Pilate, Mak agrees to camp with the shepherds, and feigns to lie down among them. However, once they have fallen asleep he casts a spell to make sure they will not wake up and then sneaks off to steal one of their sheep. He heads back to his cottage and trades insults with Gill, his wife, who firmly believes that Mak will be hanged for the theft and comes up with a plan for hiding the sheep – she will put it in an empty cradle and pretend that it is her newborn child, and that she is loudly, painfully in labor with its twin, so that the shepherds will quickly give up any search.

Mak sneaks back among the shepherds and pretends to awaken along with them. They head off to take account of their sheep while Mak heads home to prepare. With despair at their catastrophic ill fortune, the shepherds realize a sheep is missing and go to search Mak's house. They are initially fooled by Mak and Gill's ruse despite Gill going so far as to say that if she's lying she'll eat the child in her cradle (as she indeed plans to). The shepherds leave defeated, but realize that they have failed to bring any gifts to the "baby", and go back. When they remove the swaddling clothes they recognize their sheep, but decide not to kill Mak but instead roll him in canvas and throw him up and down, punishing him until they are exhausted.

When they have left Mak's cottage, the biblical story proper begins – the Angel appears and tells them to go to "Bedlam" ([[Bethlehem]]) to see the Christ child. They wonder at the event, chastising each other for their collective delay, and then go to the manger where [[Mary (Mother of Jesus)]] welcomes them and receives their praise for her mildness. They each address the Child in turn, beginning by praising His authority and His creation of all things in tones of reverence and awe, but each comically shifting mid-speech to cooing, gushing baby talk, since they are addressing an adorable baby, who Coll, Gib, and Daw respectively give "a bob of cherries," a bird, and a ball ("Have and play thee withal, and go to the tennis!")  The shepherds rejoice at their salvation, all thoughts of hardship and complaint vanished, and leave singing in unison.&lt;ref name=Wakefield&gt;{{cite book|last=Wakefield Master|title=''"The Second Shepherd's Play." in'' Early English Drama: An Anthology|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0824054652|edition=Rev.|editor=John C. Coldewey|pages=343–63.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
The name "Wakefield Master" is a title given by [[Charles Mills Gayley]] to an unknown author of at least five of the plays that are found in the Wakefield Mystery Plays. In 1903, Gayley and Alwin Thaler published an anthology of criticism and dramatic selections entitled ''Representative English Comedies.'' It had long been believed that the Towneley Play was a mediocre work that showed extensive borrowing from other sources but containing vibrant and exciting material, apparently by one author, who was responsible for four or five complete pageants and extensive revisions. Gayley refers to this person as the "master" (with a lowercase m) in the book. Then, in a 1907 article, Gayley amended this to "The Wakefield Master", the name which is still frequently used ([[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield Cycle Authorship]]). Of the 32 plays found in the manuscript, tradition has attributed ''The Second Shepherd's Play'' to the "Wakefield Master", along with ''Noah'', ''The First Shepherd's Play'', ''Herod the Great'', and ''The Buffeting of Christ.'' A sixth play, ''The Killing of Abel'' is also thought to have been heavily influenced by him if not exclusively written by him, along with ''The Last Judgment,'' of which he contributed to at least half. Many of the other plays in the manuscript have a few stanzas that were most likely written by him as well.&lt;ref name=Purdon&gt;{{cite book|last=Purdon|first=Liam O.|title=The Wakefield Master's Dramatic Art: A Drama of Spiritual Understanding|year=2003|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville|isbn=0813026032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although nothing is known about the author, or the origins of the plays, it is agreed by several scholars that they date sometime between 1400-1450. Because of his influence in most of the Wakefield plays, it is possible he was brought into Wakefield with the purpose of editing and reworking the several plays that were already written, and did such a successful job that he was kept on to write several other plays afterwards. The plays he wrote might have replaced plays that were taken from York and it is believed that he is a contemporary to the "York Master", another unnamed playwright who produced several other influential plays during the same era.

Some question the existence of one "Wakefield Master", and propose that multiple authors could have written in the Wakefield Stanza. However, scholars and literary critics find it useful to hypothesize a single talent behind them, due to the unique poetic qualities of the works ascribed to him.

The plays of the "Wakefield Master" are identified by their unique stanza form, which is nine lines rhyming a b c c c b with internal rhymes in the first four lines.&lt;ref name=Coldewey&gt;{{cite book|title=''"Introduction." in'' Early English Drama: An Anthology|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0824054652|edition=Rev.|editor=Coldewey, John C.|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''We that walk in the nights, our cattle to keep,''

''We see sudden sights, when other men sleep.''

''Yet methink my heart lights—I see shrews peep.''

''Ye are two all-wights! I will give my sheep''

	''A turn.''

''But full ill have I meant;''

''As I walk on this bent,''

''I may lightly repent''

	''My toes if I spurn.''&lt;ref name="Wakefield"/&gt;}}

This stanza format is the primary evidence critics use to identify what has been written by him. Along with his unique stanzas, the "Wakefield Master's" plays are also characterized by their emphasis on characterization that delves into the rural contemporary life of the characters. Using modern day technology which included plows, mills, and forges, as well as colloquial speech amongst the dialogue between the characters, the stories exemplified early traits of realism that would have made the stories more relevant for the audience of that time period.

The author also used contrasting dialects in ''The Second Shepherd's Play'', in the part where Mak pretends to be a yeoman. The regular dialect is Northern-midlands, with Mak's deceptive dialect being from the south. Two different studies (Trusler, and Cawley) on the main dialect certified that these plays did come from Wakefield.&lt;ref name=Irace&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irace|first=Kathleen|title=Mak's Sothren Tothe: A Philological and Critical Study of the Dialect Joke in the Second Shepherd's Play|journal=Comitatus: A Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies|date=1990|volume=21|issue=1|pages=38–39|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0tb597k2|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage==
Depending on the area of the performances, the plays were performed in the middle of the street, on [[pageant wagon]]s in the streets of great cities (this was inconvenient for the actors because the small stage size made stage movement difficult), in the halls of [[nobility]], or [[in the round]] in amphitheatres, as suggested by current archaeology in Cornwall and the southwest of England. All medieval stage production was temporary and expected to be removed upon the completion of the performances. Actors, predominantly male, typically wore long, dark robes. Medieval plays, such as the Wakefield cycle or the Digby Magdalene, featured lively interplay between two distinct areas—the wider spaces in front of the raised staging areas, and the elevated areas themselves (called, respectively, the platea and the locus). Also typical was to have the actors would move between these locations in order to suggest scene changes, rather than remain stationary and have the scene change around them as is typically done in modern theater.&lt;ref name=Vaughan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaughan|first=Míċeál F.|title=The Three Advents in the Secunda Pastorum|journal=Speculum|date=Jul 1980|volume=55|issue=3|pages=484–504|jstor=2847237|publisher=Medieval Academy of America|doi=10.2307/2847237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staging of this play likely required two sets. It is suggested that the first stage is composed of Mak's house. In Mak's house, many of the farcical actions occur (for example, this is the location of where the sheep was "born"). The other stage is where the holy manger and the religious iconography would occur. This is more than likely where the angel appears and where the Shepherds go to visit Mary. These two different stages would allow the audience to easily see the parallels between farcical and serious.

==Criticism and interpretation==
Although Albert C. Baugh complained of the combination of low farce and high religious intent in the play,&lt;ref name=Baugh&gt;{{cite book|last=Malone|first=Kemp|title=Literary History of England: Vol 1, The Middle Ages|year=1969|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0203392736|pages=281|edition=2nd|author2=Albert C. Baugh |editor=Albert C. Baugh}}&lt;/ref&gt; the unity is a distinctive feature of the play, where the Mak-subplot has been shown to have numerous analogues in world folklore.&lt;ref name=Cosbey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cosbey|first=Robert C.|title=The Mak Story and Its Folklore Analogues|journal=Speculum|date=Jul 1945|volume=20|issue=3|pages=310–17|jstor=2854613|publisher=Medieval Academy of America|doi=10.2307/2854613}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wallace H. Johnson theorized that the union of a complete and independent farce with a complete and independent Nativity play resulted from the accumulation of years of horseplay and ad-libbing in rehearsal.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Wallace H.|title=The Origin of ''The Second Shepherds' Play'': A New Theory|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|year=1966|volume=52|issue=1|pages=47|doi=10.1080/00335636609382757}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have seen the folk-origins of the story as contributing to an extended reflection on class-struggle and solidarity in light of immediate and eternal realities&lt;ref name="Cosbey"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Adam Brooke|title=Folklore and the ''Second Shepherds' Play'': A Study in Discursive Archive and Cultural Politics|journal=Allegorica|year=1992|volume=13|pages=3–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Feinstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feinstein|first=Sandy|title=Shrews and Sheep in ''The Second Shepherds' Play''|journal=Pacific Coast Philology|volume=36|pages= 64–80|year=2001|doi=10.2307/3595470}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while others have emphasized the theological dimension, in which 15th century England is mystically conflated with first-century Judaea and the Nativity with the Apocalypse.&lt;ref name="Vaughan"/&gt;

Maynard Mack explains that this play is often categorized as simple and containing little artistic merit. What begins to emerge in Mack's article is that he feels that the play is not only sophisticated, but the comedic aspects are there to enhance the rest of the text. He explains that in examining the text as two separate entities, a viewer would be doing the text a great injustice; rather, one should view them as a collection whole in order to understand the importance of exaggeration and the idea of a terrible beauty.&lt;ref name=Maynard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Mack, Jr.|title=''The Second Shepherds' Play'': A Reconsideration|journal=PMLA|date=Jan 1978|volume=93|issue=1|pages=78–85|jstor=461821|publisher=Modern Language Association|doi=10.2307/461821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wolfenstein: The Old Blood''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[first-person shooter]] video game developed by [[MachineGames]] and published by [[Bethesda Softworks]]. It was released on 5 May 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]]. The game is a stand-alone title in  the [[Wolfenstein (series)|''Wolfenstein'' series]] and a [[prequel]] to 2014's ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'', set in an alternate-history 1946. The [[Single-player video game|single-player]] story follows war veteran [[William "B.J." Blazkowicz]] and his efforts to discover the locations of a [[Nazism|Nazi]] compound. Development began in 2014, soon after the release of ''The New Order''.

The game is played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]] and its levels are navigated on foot. The story is arranged in chapters which players complete in order to progress, separated into two interconnected campaigns. The game features a variety of weapons, including pistols, shotguns, and explosives, most of which can be [[dual wield]]ed. A [[cover system]] is also present; players lean in and out of cover instead of the more common system where players lock into cover.

''Wolfenstein: The Old Blood'' received generally positive reviews. Many critics praised the game's intense firefights, intriguing locations, and the balance between [[stealth game|stealth]] and action. Many critics disliked the game's story, however, with most reviewers saying that it was the weakest part of the game and a step back compared to ''The New Order''{{'}}s story, which was highly complimented.

==Gameplay==

''Wolfenstein: The Old Blood'' changes little from the basic gameplay of ''The New Order''. As such, it is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[shooter game]] played from a [[First person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. To progress through the story, players take on enemies while navigating throughout levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/staying-in/video-games/wolfenstein-new-order-5-things-3574854 |title=Wolfenstein The New Order: 5 things you need to know about the latest instalment |last=Munbodh |first=Emma |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]] |publisher=[[Trinity Mirror|Trinity Mirror plc]] |date=20 May 2014 |accessdate=25 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6S295IJ9q |archivedate=23 August 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate sections, "health" and "armor", that regenerate. If an entire section is lost, players must find and use a health pack or body armor piece, to replenish the missing health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.techradar.com/au/news/gaming/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-wolfenstein-the-new-order-1249610 |title=5 things you need to know about Wolfenstein: The New Order |last=Langley |first=Hugh |website=[[TechRadar]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=20 May 2014 |accessdate=25 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6S2C5SM7u |archivedate=23 August 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players use [[Melee#Use in gaming|melee]] attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies, and may run, jump and occasionally swim to navigate through the locations. Melee attacks can be used to silently take down enemies without being detected. Alternatively, players can [[ambush]] enemies, which will result in an intense [[Shootout|firefight]] between the two parties. Enemy types vary; standard [[Nazism|Nazi]] human soldiers, which vary in strength, robot-like characters known as Supersoldaten (Super Soldiers), giant mechanical dogs known as Panzerhunds, [[zombie]]-like Nazi soldiers and civilians known as Shamblers, and vicious dogs are some of the enemies players will encounter.&lt;ref name="GS-choice"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-the-new-order-offers-a-choice-quiet-stealth-or-bloody-mayhem/1100-6419290/ |title=Wolfenstein: The New Order offers a choice – Quiet stealth or bloody mayhem |last=Makuch |first=Eddie |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=25 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6S2C9g5FP |archivedate=23 August 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In combat, a [[cover system]] can be used as assistance against enemies. Players have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which can be used as a [[Positional advantage|tactical advantage]] during shootouts and [[Stealth game|stealth]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2014/05/21/5-reasons-why-wolfenstein-the-new-order-is-shooter-of-the-year-so-far/ |title=5 Reasons Why 'Wolfenstein: The New Order' Is Shooter Of The Year (So Far) |last=Kain |first=Erik |website=[[Forbes]] |publisher=Forbes Media, LLC |date=21 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6S2CEpxgH |archivedate=23 August 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows the player to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players have the ability to [[dual wield]], giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage.&lt;ref name="GS-choice"/&gt; ''The Old Blood'' adds various weapons that were not featured in ''The New Order'',&lt;ref name="PAX Streams"/&gt; such as a steel pipe.&lt;ref name="7 Things"/&gt; The steel pipe is one of the biggest additions to the game; it consists of two small steel pipes which can be connected together to make a larger pipe. Both pipe states can be used as a melee attacks (each with their own animations) and in specific circumstances. The two small pipes, called "Pipes" in the weapon inventory, can be used to climb rock walls, and the large pipe, called "Pipe" in the inventory, is used to break open weak environmental surfaces.&lt;ref name="7 Things"/&gt; The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options—they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/05/20/wolfenstein-the-new-order-battles-evil-nazis-but-cant-fight-off-middling-reviews/ |title=Wolfenstein: The New Order battles evil Nazis but can't fight off middling reviews |last=Takahashi |first=Dean |website=[[VentureBeat]] |date=20 May 2014 |accessdate=25 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6S2ChpvT4 |archivedate=23 August 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/223752/Game_Design_Deep_Dive_Ammo_Collection_in_Wolfenstein_The_New_Order.php |title=Game Design Deep Dive: Ammo Collection in Wolfenstein: The New Order |last=Gustafsson |first=Jerk |website=[[Gamasutra]] |publisher=[[UBM plc]] |date=21 August 2014 |accessdate=23 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6S2LUiN75 |archivedate=23 August 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with ''The New Order'', players can complete "Perks"; each Perk has a task the player can complete. Perks encourage the player to change their play style on the fly; collecting "helmets", getting silent kills, killing specific enemies a select number of times, getting a set number of kills with a specific weapon, and getting kills via explosives are some of the objectives. Once a Perk's task is complete, the player unlocks a bonus, such as more overall health or armor, more ammunition for a certain weapon, or the ability to gain health after a silent takedown.&lt;ref name="Destructoid Review"/&gt; Various collectibles are also scattered throughout the levels; concept art, character models and bios, notes, which tell small side stories of the game, and gold bars are some of the collectibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.primagames.com/games/wolfenstein-new-order/coverage/wolfenstein-old-blood-walkthrough-and-collectibles |title=Wolfenstein: The Old Blood Walkthrough and Collectibles |last=Lavoy |first=Bill |website=[[Prima Games]] |publisher=[[Random House]] |date=12 May 2015 |accessdate=27 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ypfx3u3B |archivedate=27 May 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modes in the game differing from the main chapters are Challenge Arenas and Nightmare Levels. Challenge Arenas unlock as the player progresses through the story and are accessed from the main menu. Being a basic arena battle mode, players fight waves of enemies to obtain a Bronze, Silver, or Gold metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamestyle.com/review/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review/ |title=Wolfenstein: The Old Blood Review |last=Gulliver |first=Adam |website=GameStyle |publisher=[[WordPress]] |date=11 May 2015 |accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nightmare Levels are accessed by finding and interacting with a bed that is hidden in each chapter. There's a hidden [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]] where players can play ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]''; the player moves through pixelated hallways, mostly equipped with just a pistol, fighting Nazi soldiers. The objective is to find a key that unlocks an elevator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-nightmare-guide |title=Wolfenstein: The Old Blood Nightmare Guide |last=Hawkins |first=Josh |website=[[Eurogamer|USGamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |date=11 May 2015 |accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Wolfenstein: The Old Blood'' takes place in an [[alternate history]] 1946, just prior to the prologue of ''Wolfenstein: The New Order'', with O.S.A. agents William "B.J." Blazkowicz ([[Brian Bloom]]) and Richard Wesley (taking up the codename Agent One) on a mission to infiltrate Castle Wolfenstein and obtain a top secret folder containing the location of ''[[SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer]]'' Wilhelm "Deathshead" Strasse from the castle's commander, Nazi archeologist and ''[[Standartenführer]]in'' Helga von Schabbs. Entering the castle disguised as [[Schutzstaffel]] officers, B.J. and Wesley fail to find the folder and are captured by Helga's lieutenant, ''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' Rudi Jäger, a massive and sadistic dog trainer who feeds captured prisoners to his mechanically augmented canines. While Wesley is dragged away by Rudi for interrogation, B.J. succeeds in escaping the prison cells and fighting his way through the castle. B.J. eventually locates Wesley strapped to an electric chair used by the Nazis for torture. Before B.J. can rescue Wesley, Rudi activates the chair and electrocutes him. Jager then feeds Wesley's dead body to his prized albino dog, Greta, and straps B.J. into the chair, shocking him as well. B.J. breaks free, injures Rudi, and kills Greta.

Escaping the castle, B.J. travels to the nearby village of Paderborn and meets up with the local [[German resistance to Nazism|German resistance]] leader, Ludwig Kessler, as well as Kessler's assistant Annette, a young [[Jews|Jewish]] girl whom Kessler is sheltering from the Nazis. Kessler's tavern is attacked by Nazi forces led by Rudi, wearing an experimental suit of [[Powered exoskeleton|power armor]], whom B.J. defeats and kills. B.J., Kessler, and Annette flee via rowboat to the village of Wulfburg, where Helga is conducting an archeological excavation attempting to find a hidden underground vault containing occult knowledge previously possessed by [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]].

After meeting up with O.S.A. operative Pippa (codenamed Agent Two), B.J. disguises himself as a waiter and infiltrates the tavern where Helga is staying. Helga sees through B.J.'s disguise and captures him, but B.J. manages to escape during a massive earthquake caused by the Nazis opening the vault. The opening of the vault also releases a gas that causes anyone that dies within the vicinity of Wulfburg to reanimate as hostile, burning, zombies known as "shamblers". B.J. fights his way through the burning ruins of Wulfburg while fighting through the zombified Nazis and civilians who died in the earthquake. Agent Two is killed by a shambler, and B.J. has to kill her again when she reanimates as one. Attempting to return to Kessler and Annette, B.J. finds the two of them have gone into Wulfburg in an attempt to rescue Annette's companion, Katrin.

B.J. finds Annette and Kessler separated by a collapsing bridge and stranded on opposite buildings, and the player is given the choice of traveling to Annette's building or Kessler's building. The person B.J. travels to will be rescued by him, while the other person will be killed by the shamblers. B.J. then travels to the Nazi excavation in pursuit of Helga, finally encountering her within King Otto's vault. There he finds the source of the zombie-creating gas, an undead giant known as 'The Monstrosity,' a creature created by King Otto's alchemists as a weapon of war, then sealed away by the king after deciding it was an abomination. Helga is initially successful in using [[Old High German]] commands to control the monster, but when she attempts to order it to eat B.J., the monster fatally wounds her instead. B.J. fights and kills The Monstrosity, then finally obtains the secret folder from a dying Helga. B.J. is extracted from Wulfburg by his friend Fergus, and the two of them embark from [[RAF Kinloss]] to assassinate Deathshead and end the war, while B.J. thinks about the nature of monsters and hopes that he can finally rest after this [[Wolfenstein: The New Order|one final mission]].

==Development==
The existence of ''Wolfenstein: The Old Blood'' was first acknowledged by [[Bethesda Softworks]] on 4 March 2015, through the release of an announcement trailer.&lt;ref name="Announcement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/bethesda-reveals-wolfenstein-the-new-blood |title=Bethesda Reveals Wolfenstein: The Old Blood |last=Reilly |first=Luke |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=4 March 2015 |accessdate=9 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WsqjBZvT |archivedate=8 March 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footage of the game was showcased at [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX East]] on 6–7 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-06-first-gameplay-of-wolfenstein-the-old-blood |title=First gameplay of Wolfenstein: The Old Blood |last=Yin-Poole |first=Wesley |website=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |date=6 March 2015 |accessdate=9 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Wsr0RoUa |archivedate=8 March 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though initially announced to only be available digitally,&lt;ref name="Announcement"/&gt; it was later confirmed that the game would also receive a physical retail release in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/20/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-physical-release-dates-announced-for-europe |title=Wolfenstein: The Old Blood Physical Release Dates Announced for Europe |last=Kubba |first=Sinan |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=20 March 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Xqxchfq3 |archivedate=17 March 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development team initially planned to create a series of individual [[downloadable content]] (DLC) packs, but later decided to change this to a [[Stand-alone expansion pack|standalone expansion pack]]. When this decision was made, development on two of the DLC was already underway, and the team decided to merge the two DLC into one standalone game. During this process, some members of the team experimented with creating artwork of the game in the style of movie posters from the 1960s, resulting in the inspiration to make the game have a "[[B movie]] vibe", though the game also took inspiration from films such as ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967) and ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/wolfenstein_the_old_blood/b/playstation4/archive/2015/04/24/machinegames-looks-to-the-past-to-inform-the-future.aspx |title=MachineGames Looks To The Past To Inform The Future |last=Miller |first=Matt |website=[[Game Informer]] |publisher=[[GameStop]] |date=24 April 2015 |accessdate=27 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Y6I71Wzg |archivedate=27 April 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development team's decision to make the game a prequel was to allow players to experience the game without playing previous titles in the series.&lt;ref name="PAX Streams"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethblog.com/2015/03/12/new-gameplay-the-old-blood/ |title=New Gameplay.

"It's something you can just play through and immediately have fun", said executive producer Jerk Gustafsson.&lt;ref name="7 Things"/&gt; The team also tried to create different route possibilities within the combat spaces, offering a balance between stealth and action sequences.&lt;ref name="What's New"/&gt;

At one point during the game, Blazkowicz encounters a group of inebriated Nazis singing in a tavern. Though the [[motion capture]] was performed by actors, the audio director requested for the voices to be performed by members of the development team; to achieve an accurate performance, members of the team learned some [[German language|German]], and became inebriated prior to recording.&lt;ref name="7 Things"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethblog.com/2015/04/15/7-things-you-need-to-know-about-wolfenstein-the-old-blood/ |title=7 Things You Need to Know About Wolfenstein: The Old Blood |last=Steinman |first=Gary |website=[[Bethesda Softworks]] |publisher=[[ZeniMax Media]] |date=15 April 2015 |accessdate=17 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XpdlXR6N |archivedate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team initially planned to reuse assets from ''The New Order'' in ''The Old Blood'', but ultimately altered most assets in some way.&lt;ref name="7 Things"/&gt; Due to the team's focus on [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation]] consoles and PC, they were able to achieve some [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] updates, as well as the creation of larger and more detailed environments in the game.&lt;ref name="What's New"/&gt; The game also intentionally included several references to ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/04/15/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-pc-ps4-xbox-one-zombie-nazi/ |title=Content in Wolfenstein: The Old Blood tips its hat to Return to Castle Wolfenstein |last=Nunneley |first=Stephany |website=[[VG247]] |date=15 April 2015 |accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wolfenstein: The Old Blood'' makes use of an original score, composed by musician Mick Gordon, who also composed the [[Wolfenstein: The New Order ‒ Original Game Soundtrack|soundtrack]] for ''The New Order''. To create music with a style reflecting the game, Gordon performed with a [[string quartet]], spending time manipulating a broken [[mandolin]] and [[cello]]. He also placed some items inside a [[piano]], to create a unique sound.&lt;ref name="What's New"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-s-new-in-wolfenstein-the-old-blood/1100-6426667/ |title=What's New in Wolfenstein: The Old Blood |author=GameSpot staff |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=16 April 2015 |accessdate=17 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XqgrVDts |archivedate=17 April 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wolfenstein: The Old Blood'' received "generally favorable reviews" on all platforms according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCXONE"/&gt;

''[[Destructoid]]'''s Chris Carter praised the game for its brevity, saying that both episodes "don't waste as much time as some missions in [''The New Order'']. Both Castle Wolfenstein and Wulfburg are expansive enough to justify an entire game." He also said that "the development team does a good job of managing the pacing between stealth and action". Carter said that Helga Von Schabbs is a character that kept him "engaged" throughout the game, that he "slightly [preferred]" ''The Old Blood'' over ''The New Order'', and that choosing to play the game is a "no-brainer".&lt;ref name="Destructoid Review"/&gt;

''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'''s [[Justin McElroy]] complimented the game's action gameplay, stating that he liked the choice of weapons, the gunplay, and the mix of stealth and action, while being critical of the game for not having the components that made ''The New Order'' great. "''The Old Blood'' suggests [[B movie|B-movie]] camp", McElroy said, "there are barely any moments where the action slows down enough to develop the type of characters and motivation that charged the big combat set pieces in [''The''] ''New Order''".&lt;ref name="Polygon Review"/&gt;

Marty Sliva of [[IGN]] complimented the game's stealth puzzles, saying, "These scenes turn down the volume, but keep the tension high, as many enemies are able to tear you apart extremely quickly if you get caught." Sliva also "appreciated" the easter eggs referencing other Bethesda games, liked the firefights, which he called "satisfying", and praised the environment, which he said was "interesting". Sliva did however dislike the presence of zombies, the "weak" story, and having to manually pick up items. Sliva wrapped up his review by saying "''Wolfenstein: The Old Blood'' doubles down on blood and guts, but in doing so sacrifices some of its heart."&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt;

''[[PC Gamer|PC Gamer UK]]'''s Chris Thursten said, "what was novel a year ago isn't necessarily novel now". He was mostly positive of the game's action gunplay, calling it "excellent". He said the Challenge arenas are also a good addition that he'd like to see in future ''Wolfenstein'' games. Most negative comments were related to ''The New Order'', in Thursten's opinion, being superior to ''The Old Blood''. Thursten said ,"Nothing in ''The Old Blood'' exceeds what was achieved in ''The New Order'', and there are moments when the two are uncannily similar".&lt;ref name="PC Gamer Review"/&gt;

[[GamesRadar+]]'s Andi Hamilton praised the game's shooting gameplay, calling it "satisfying", the "strong" pacing, the visuals, particularly the set pieces, which he called "beautiful", and the fact it's a standalone game, Hamilton said it "works". Hamilton did however call the game's story "weak" compared to ''The New Order'', and said certain stealth sections were "rough". Hamilton summarized his review by saying "''Wolfenstein: The Old Blood'' is another sterling effort from MachineGames, fast proving to be real players in the FPS genre. This add-on clearly has smaller scope than was found in ''The New Order'', keeping things much more 'down to Earth', but the core shooting experience that makes the reborn Wolfenstein such a pleasure to play remains perfectly intact. If you like shooting zombies and Nazis with extravagantly powerful weapons (and lets be honest here, who doesn’t?) this is well worth checking out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/wolfenstein-old-blood-review/ |last=Hamilton |first=Andi |title=Wolfenstein: The Old Blood review |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=8 May 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508230002/http://www.gamesradar.com/wolfenstein-old-blood-review/ |archivedate=8 May 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Bertz of ''[[Game Informer]]'' said: "Had ''The Old Blood'' been injected with more new blood, maybe it would have matched or surpassed the quality of ''The New Order''. But by over-relying on nostalgia to drive the experience, it's well-crafted fan service rather than an attempt to push the series in new directions. For a standalone expansion that's not an unforgivable offense, but we're excited to see what Machine Games can do with the series now that this genealogical exercise is flushed out of its system."&lt;ref name="Game Informer Review"/&gt;

In Japan, where the Xbox One version was ported for release on 28 May 2015,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} followed by the PlayStation 4 version on 4 June 2015,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of two eights, one nine, and one eight for a total of 33 out of 40.&lt;ref name="Famitsu Scores"/&gt;

Tom Hoggins of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave the PS4 version four stars out of five and said, "For those that have played through ''The New Order'' and are keen for more of its beefy action, this delivers around 7 hours of it for a decent price. I’d argue ''The Old Blood'' also makes a satisfying starter to ''The New Order''’s more substantial meal if you haven’t yet had a taste. A well-priced piece of downloadable content that works equally well on either side of the main game? Clever."&lt;ref name="Telegraph Review"/&gt; David Jenkins of ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' gave the same console version eight out of ten and called it "A great follow-up to ''The New Order'', which cleverly reuses all of its best features and yet still finds time to add plenty of new elements of its own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://metro.co.uk/2015/05/06/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review-back-to-the-castle-5183748/ |title=Wolfenstein: The Old Blood review - back to the castle (PS4) |last=Jenkins |first=David |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |publisher=[[DMG Media]] |date=6 May 2015 |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Clark of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it "a wonderful palate cleanser, something to undo long-standing wrongs before diving in to a much deeper, gratifying installment. The conundrum is that the people who already know what MachineGames is capable of with this series have seen the future, and ''The Old Blood'' doesn't provide all that compelling a reason to return to the past."&lt;ref name="Slant Review"/&gt; Christopher Byrd of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the same console version an average review and said, "The game’s B-movie vibe is evocative of the work of those skilled filmmakers who embrace the silly or even the self-consciously stupid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/05/12/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review-a-game-that-comfortably-embraces-the-silly/ |title=Wolfenstein: The Old Blood review.

It’s a great deal for the price – as a $25 digital download via the PlayStation Store, the Xbox Games Store and Steam, it’s a rarity in an era when 25 bucks might get you a couple map packs’ worth of downloadable content – but I’ve discovered there’s such a thing as too old-school."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://torontosun.com/2015/05/06/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review-new-order-prequel-a-little-too-old-school/wcm/a83ef544-226b-4094-8fe2-c56d63ccfe19 |title=Wolfenstein: The Old Blood review: 'New Order' prequel a little too old-school (PS4) |last=Tilley |first=Steve |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |publisher=[[Postmedia Network]] |date=6 May 2015 |accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drew Toal of ''[[The A.V.

Club]] |publisher=[[The Onion]] |date=20 May 2015 |accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebenezer Samuel of ''[[New York Daily News]]'' gave the Xbox One version three stars out of five and called it "a less weighty experience overall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/wolfenstein-old-blood-solide-prequel-review-article-1.2226988 |title=Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is solid prequel, but doesn’t match predecessor’s magic: Video Game Review (XONE) |last=Samuel |first=Ebenezer |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |publisher=[[Tronc]] |date=18 May 2015 |accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Emoji Day is "the brainchild of [[Jeremy Burge]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=David |first=Javier |title=World Emoji Day finds its place on a packed calendar of holidays |website=[[CNBC]] |date=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[CNBC]] who stated that "London-based founder of [[Emojipedia]] created it" in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neill Deighan |first=Emma |title=It’s World Emoji Day, how will you celebrate? |url=http://www.belfastlive.co.uk/incoming/its-world-emoji-day-how-9680218 |accessdate=21 April 2016 |website=[[Belfast Live]] |date=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
