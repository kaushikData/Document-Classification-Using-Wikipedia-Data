'''Alfred, Count de Baillet Latour''' (1901 – 28 September 1980) was a Belgian count.

==End of the [[House of Baillet]]==
Alfred was the last grandson of [[Ferdinand de Baillet-Latour]], [[Governor of Antwerp]] and a nephew of [[Henri de Baillet-Latour|Henri II, Count de Baillet-Latour]] (1876-1942): 3rd president of the International Olympic Committee.

His mother was viscountess [[House of Spoelberch|Antoinette de Spoelberch]], and belonged to the owners of Artois holding. He started his professional career at the [[InBev|Artois]] brewery in 1936 and became its president in 1947. 

He died without heirs, and the family fortune was, according to his will, used to found the [[Artois-Baillet Latour Foundation]].

'''Alfredo Enrique Nalib Yabrán''' (November 1, 1944&amp;nbsp; in [[Larroque, Entre Ríos|Larroque]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]] – May 20, 1998) was a powerful [[businessperson|businessman]] in [[Argentina]], with close links with the government, in particular with the administration of [[Carlos Saúl Menem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2001/3/11/politica-7925.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508065057/http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2001/3/11/politica-7925.asp |archivedate=2012-05-08 |df= }} Afirman que Menem recibió una mansión de Yabrán
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Yabrán was born in [[Larroque, Entre Ríos|Larroque]], province of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Rios]], in 1944, the seventh son of Nallib Miguel Yabrán and Emilia Tufic Marpez, both children of Lebanese immigrants.

He moved to Buenos Aires in the early 60's, as he began to do business in the areas of security and banking transactions. In the 70's, he became one of the main shareholders of [[Ocasa]], and at the end of President [[Raúl Alfonsín]]'s  term he began to operate airport security in Ezeiza.

His name became known due to allegations of former economy minister [[Domingo Cavallo]]. At a session of the Congress in 1995, the then finance minister denounced Yabrán as a kind of mafia boss with political and judicial protection. Yabrán, currently known by the general public, was largely unknown at the time and the press did not have any pictures of him.

Legally, Yabrán only declared a few companies, but Cavallo accused him of driving, through [[Proxy voting|proxies]], other major companies. Among them, [[Correo OCA]] (which handled 30% of the Argentine postal market), Ocasa (which Yabrán claimed to have sold ), [[Ciccone Calcográfica]] (a print and minting company that printed the Patacones Bonaerenses in the 2001 recession) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/75487-los-ciccone-niegan-que-los-controle-yabran&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2002/2/27/un-34389.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and a transport and logistics company called [[Villalonga Furlong]]. These companies were sold to the [[Exxel Group]]  for $605 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-71627-2006-08-18.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/148406-exxel-reestructura-villalonga-furlong&lt;/ref&gt;

The main accusation against Yabrán was that their transport and security companies were being used to hide drugs, [[weapons trafficking]] and [[money laundering]].

Among other things, he owned the private [[courier]] company [[OCASA]], and the immense {{convert|2723269|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} - of which  {{convert|645834|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} are covered - [[EDCADASSA]] warehouses at the [[Ezeiza International Airport|Ezeiza international airport]] in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/164359-yabran-y-la-mafia-del-oro&lt;/ref&gt;

When his name became known due to allegations of former economy minister Domingo Cavallo, Yabrán was extremely secretive and jealous of his privacy. After the [[murder]] of photojournalist [[José Luis Cabezas]], who had been investigating Yabrán, he was forced to come out in public and face the suspicions of society.

===Close links with Menem's government===
The killing of Cabezas embarrassed President Carlos Menem's government while Menem admitted that Emir Yoma was Alfredo Yabrán's friend, he denied that Yabran knew him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/69608-admitio-menem-que-emir-yoma-es-amigo-de-yabran&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/66205-el-presidente-menem-aseguro-que-no-es-amigo-de-yabran&lt;/ref&gt;

His former wife [[Zulema Yoma]] insisted that they were close friends, and was proven right when it was found out that Yabran had given Menem a mansion in Buenos Aires as a marriage gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2001/3/11/politica-7925.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508065057/http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2001/3/11/politica-7925.asp |archivedate=2012-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Minister Elias Jassan had to resign over the 102 calls he personally made to Yabran and because of the calls that he had with Yabran's bodyguards the day after the murder of Cabezas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/70853-la-custodia-de-yabran-llamo-a-jassan&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabinet Minister Jorge Rodriguez was criticized for receiving Yabran in the [[Casa Rosada]].&lt;ref&gt;http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1997/06/24/t-00601d.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide===
In 1998,  Yabrán was found dead in one of his houses, with a gunshot through his face which left him nearly unrecognizable.&lt;ref name="IRBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,QUERYRESPONSE,ARG,4562d94e2,3df4be0c30,0.html|title=Argentina: Individuals present at the time of Alfredo Yabrán's suicide in May 1998; reports of Yabrán faking his own death in order to evade capture by the authorities ( 1998-May 2001)|author=Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada|id=ARG37222.E|date=30 May 2001|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur James Edward Child''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (May 19, 1910 &amp;ndash; July 30, 1996) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman and former chairman and chief executive officer of Burns Foods Limited of [[Calgary]]. Arthur James Edward Child and his business partner Ron Jackson acquired the food processing and distribution company in a leveraged [[management buyout]] in 1986. With sales in excess of $1 billion, Burns Foods was involved in meat processing, dairy, food warehousing and distribution, and vegetable processing businesses. Over a 12-year period, Arthur James Edward Child and his management team built Burns Foods into a leading Canadian food company with over $1 billion in annual sales. Beginning in 1995, a majority of the Burns Foods' subsidiaries were sold generating an exceptional return to the shareholders.

Born in [[Guildford]], [[England]], he earned a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] in 1931 from [[Queen's University]]. After working in the food industry, he received a [[Master of Arts]] in economics from the [[University of Toronto]].

In 1985, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].

Child was a Reform member and on the board of the Canadian South African Society—a front group supporting apartheid and funded principally by the South African embassy in Ottawa. Child is the only Canadian to have received the apartheid regime's medal of honour [2].

'''Borderland State Park''' is a history and nature preserve with public recreational features located in the [[New England town|towns]] of [[Easton, Massachusetts|Easton]] and [[Sharon, Massachusetts|Sharon]], [[Massachusetts]]. The [[state park]] encompasses {{convert|1843|acre}} surrounding the Ames Mansion, which was built in 1910. The area was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as '''Borderland Historic District''' in 1997. It is operated by the [[Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]], with an appointed advisory council that participates in policy decision-making.&lt;ref name=dcr/&gt;

==History==
In 1906, [[Oakes Ames (botanist)|Oakes Ames]], a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[botanist]] (son of Massachusetts governor [[Oliver Ames (governor)|Oliver Ames]] and grandson of U.S. Representative [[Oakes Ames]]), and his wife [[Blanche Ames Ames]] (daughter of Mississippi governor [[Adelbert Ames]], but not related to Oakes Ames), an artist and feminist, purchased land on the border of Sharon and Easton. There they built a mansion which still stands and created a nature preserve with woodland paths and roadways and man-made ponds. The family's home, a three-story, 20-room stone mansion constructed in 1910, was built largely at the direction of Blanche Ames.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;&lt;ref name=nps/&gt; Her paintings still hang on the walls and much of the original furnishings are still intact. After remaining in the family for sixty-five years, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts acquired the Borderland estate in 1971, two years after the death of Blanche Ames, and opened it as a state park.&lt;ref name=dcr/&gt;

==Activities and amenities==
The park has more than {{convert|20|mi}} of wooded trails for hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding. Trails include a portion of the [[Bay Circuit Trail]] and the Quarry Loop to Moyles Quarry which supplied the facing stone for the [[Canton Viaduct]] in 1835.&lt;ref name=map/&gt; The park features mansion tours, a visitors center, pond fishing and canoeing, ice skating, sledding, and disc golf.&lt;ref name=visit/&gt;

Borderland is the home course for [[Oliver Ames High School]] [[cross country running|cross country team]].&lt;ref name=wicked/&gt; It is also utilized by the [[Old Colony League]] for its annual cross country meet, hosts the [[Hockomock League]] Championship meet and various invitational meets on the {{convert|3.1|mi|km|adj=mid|-loop}} course, and was the site of the World Masters Flying Disc Championships in 1996.

==In popular culture==
The park has been used in a commercial, a documentary, and the film [[Mermaids (1990 film)|''Mermaids'']]. Scenes from the [[Martin Scorsese]] movie [[Shutter Island (film)|''Shutter Island'']] were shot at the stone lodge next to Leach Pond in 2008.&lt;ref name=patriot/&gt; Ames Mansion interiors were used as a filming location for ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'' in 2016.&lt;ref name=digest/&gt; A fictionalized version of the park is featured in the novel ''Disappearance at Devil's Rock'' by [[Paul G. Tremblay|Paul Tremblay.]]

'''''Business Centre Europe''''' is a [[business]] news programme once aired on [[CNBC Europe]] that replaced Europe Tonight.  Airing from 18.00 UK time, ''Business Centre Europe'' was a 30-minute wrap-up of the day's top business stories in Europe and also crossed over to the US to update progress on the trading day there.  The show was initially presented by Sarah Clements and then by Emma Crosby.

The show took its name from CNBC US' flagship evening show, ''Business Center''.  However unlike its U.S. and [[Business Center (CNBC Asia)|Asian]] counterparts which used slightly different lower-thirds on screen, the show's lower-thirds were the exactly same as the ones used on CNBC Europe's other daytime programmes.

The programme was canceled in late 2001 where Emma Crosby co-anchored the show preceding its timeslot, ''European Market Wrap'' along with Nigel Roberts.

The '''Care Bears''' are a fictional group of multi-colored bear characters originally painted in 1981 by artist [[Elena Kucharik]] to be used on [[greeting cards]] from [[American Greetings]], but  later used for toys, in TV programs, and in films. There are 218 Care Bears to date. 

The original development was through American Greetings' "Those Characters From Cleveland" [[research and development]] division, In 1983, [[Kenner Products|Kenner]] turned the Care Bears into plush [[teddy bear]]s. The Care Bears appeared in TV specials called ''[[The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine]]'' (1984). They then had a [[The Care Bears (TV series)|television series]] from 1985 to 1988, and three feature films: ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'' (1985), ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'' (1986) and ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'' (1987).

Each Care Bear comes in a different color and has a specialized insignia on its belly that represents its personality.  The movie ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]'' named them "belly badges". Adding to the Care Bear family are the "Care Bear Cousins", which feature a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon, monkey, elephant, pig, dog, cat, and other such animals created in the same style as the teddy bears.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 2002, the bears were reintroduced with new toys. Made by Play-Along Toys, the new toys offered features such as illuminated bellies upon touch, aerobic bears, and glow-in-the-dark bears. As part of this comeback, the Bears have appeared in two [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] movies: ''[[Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot]]'' (2004), ''[[The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie]]'' (2005) and ''The Care Bears' Rise Up Of Kingdom'' (2006). In 2007, the franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary; another relaunch took place, as well as the release of ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In mid-2011, American Greetings announced a revival TV animated series titled ''[[Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot]]''. The premiere of the series utilizes "30 years of caring". It premiered on [[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]] on June 2, 2012. Though Welcome to Care-a-Lot lasted one season, a continuation of the series, "Care Bears and Cousins", was commissioned by [[Netflix]] and premiered November 6, 2015. The cast of characters and animation style of Welcome to Care-a-Lot remains for Care Bears and Cousins. Toy company Just Play debuted a range of Care Bears toys (plush, figures &amp; blind bag collectibles) based on the Welcome to Care-a-Lot characters and style guide in Spring 2015. Just Play continued their range of product for Care Bears and Cousins in 2016.

== History ==

=== Development ===
The Care Bears were initially created in 1981 by Those Characters From Cleveland (TCFC), the licensing division of American Greetings. [[Jack Chojnacki]], the co-president of TCFC, introduced the first Care Bear, to six businessmen—three from American Greeting Cards, and three from the toy company [[Kenner Products|Kenner]]—in February 1981. On the employees' reaction to the toy, Chojnacki recalled in early 1985: "It had a high aaaaaah factor."&lt;ref name=aaah&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rfEPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mIwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3720,590789&amp;dq=care+bears+movie&amp;hl=en |last=Connelly |first=Sherryl |agency=[[New York Daily News]] |title=High 'aaah" factor has meant millions |date=April 2, 1985 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |work=[[Boca Raton News]] |page=4B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muriel Fahrion]], the artist who helped create [[Strawberry Shortcake]]'s look, was also among the franchise's first concept artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXBZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Muriel+Fahrion+-+Care+Bears&amp;dq=Muriel+Fahrion+-+Care+Bears |author1=Ligue française de l'enseignement et de l'éducation permanente |author2=Union française des œuvres laïques d'éducation par l'image et le son |title=La Revue du cinéma |volume=418 |chapter=Les Bisounours (The Care Bears Movie) |language=French |page=26 |year=1986 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=Ligue française de l'enseignement et de l'éducation permanente |quote=Scn. : Peter Sauder, d'après les personnages créés pour Those Characters from Cleveland par Linda Edwards, Muriel Fahrion, Elena Kucharik, Dave Polter, Tom Schneider, Ralph Shaffer, Clark Willey.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with TCFC Creative VP Ralph Shaffer, Muriel designed the first six bears, creating the best-selling greeting card themes for their belly graphics. Susan Trentel, Muriel's sister and doll designer of Strawberry Shortcake, designed the Care Bears plush. Once out of the concept stage children's book illustrator [[Elena Kucharik]] became the primary artist for the Care Bears creating hundreds of full color illustrations for cards, books and a myriad of licensed products. TCFC's creative team of artists and writers worked to create numerous characters in the line, which was a joint development by Those Characters From Cleveland and MAD (Marketing and Design Service of the toy group of [[General Mills]]).&lt;ref name=guilford&gt;{{cite book |last=Pecora |first=Norma Odom |title=The Business of Children's Entertainment |isbn=1-57230-774-9 |year=1998 |publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

As they had done with [[Strawberry Shortcake]], once titled "Project I", American Greeting Cards called the Care Bears development "Project II" as they strove to make the character program secret until advertising was ready. At the start of the franchise, Care Bears was already established as its working title.&lt;ref name=cbsite&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301073233/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/funfacts.html |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/funfacts.html |title=History &amp; Facts: More Care Bears Fun Facts |archivedate=March 1, 2005 |accessdate=March 17, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1982 launch ===
On September 24, 1982, the Care Bears franchise was launched in New York City before members of the area's Society of Security Analysts.&lt;ref name="cb-pr"&gt;{{cite press release |title=The biggest character launch in the history of retailing ... |date=September 24, 1982 |location=New York City |work=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attending the event were American Greetings president Morry Weiss, and two employees of Those Characters from Cleveland: Jack Chojnacki and senior vice-president Henry Lowenthal.&lt;ref name="cb-pr" /&gt; Eventually, the characters were announced as a toyline for production by [[Parker Brothers]] and Kenner the following spring, as well as pre-licensed characters and media stars. At that time, American Greetings touted their debut as "the biggest character launch in the history of retailing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI%7CDN&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB294D2283BB84A&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |last=DeWolf |first=Rose |title=Out to launch: Is there shelf life after Holly Hobbie?

In December 1983, American Greetings and CPG Products lost a lawsuit against Easter Unlimited, importers of a line known as "Message Bears". According to New York City judge Leonard B. Sand, those toys lacked the "heart-shaped 'touché tags'" used to identify the Care Bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LVouAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=udoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5386,2660829&amp;dq=care-bears&amp;hl=en |author=[[Associated Press]] (AP) |title='Care Bears' makers lose copyright suit |date=December 14, 1983 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |work=[[Beaver County Times]] |page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, AGC introduced a spin-off line, the Care Bear Cousins; another syndicated special, ''[[The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine]]'', came out that same year. A [[miniseries]] based on the toys was distributed by [[Lexington Broadcast Services Company]].&lt;ref name=guilford /&gt;{{rp|52}} A year later, the Bears and Cousins starred in their first film, ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', produced by [[Nelvana]] Limited and released by [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]].

In 1986, Nelvana returned to the franchise with a second movie, ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]''. Released by [[Columbia Pictures]], the film featured a new villain, Dark Heart, and introduced more of the Care Bears and Care Bears Cousins: Harmony Bear, True Heart Bear, and Noble Heart Horse.

Later that year, a TV series titled ''The Care Bears Family'' (also from Nelvana) premiered on the U.S. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]] and Canada's [[Global Television Network|Global]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The new season children's shows |date=September 9, 1986 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |publisher=[[CTVglobemedia]] |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasting two seasons and consisting of over 70 episodes, this introduced the evil wizard [[List of Care Bear characters#No Heart|No Heart]] and his sidekick Beastly. In the second season, No Heart's niece [[Shreeky]] was introduced.

The Care Bears' third film, ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'', debuted in 1987. A TV special, ''[[Care Bears Nutcracker Suite]]'', premiered on the Disney Channel in 1988.

Over 40 million Care Bears were sold between 1983 and 1987, and American Greetings printed over 70&amp;nbsp;million of their cards during the decade. In whole, the sales of their merchandise reached over $2&amp;nbsp;billion during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=agsite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.americangreetings.com/aboutus/history.html |title=About Us: History |accessdate=February 26, 2006 |publisher=[[American Greetings]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210053021/http://corporate.americangreetings.com/aboutus/history.html |archivedate=December 10, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbhistory&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050303062052/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/index.html |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/index.html |title=History &amp; Facts |archivedate=March 3, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1991 relaunch ===
In early 1991, Those Characters from Cleveland and Kenner embarked on a relaunch of the franchise, involving seven bears. One of the Care Bear Cousins, Proud Heart Cat, was released as a bear with white fur that sported the belly symbol of a heart-shaped American flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DDNB&amp;p_theme=ddnb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F504F756A8A1153&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |last=Moss |first=Meredith |title=She's a living doll |date=March 3, 1991 |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |work=[[Dayton Daily News]] |publisher=Cox Ohio Publishing |page=5E |quote=Patriotic bears: Two Ohio companies have joined together to teach children about the environment and patriotism....}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publishing company [[Random House]] released two tie-in books: ''The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup'' (1991) by Bobbi Katz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-big-cleanup/oclc/23583231 |title=Catalog information for ''The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |work=[[WorldCat]] |publisher=[[Online Computer Library Center]] (OCLC) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910173629/http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-big-cleanup/oclc/23583231 |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Big-Cle/dp/0679823670/ |title=Product information for ''The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] Inc |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503023757/http://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Big-Cle/dp/0679823670 |archivedate=May 3, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Care Bears and the Whale Tale'' (1992) by Peggy Kahn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-whale-tale/oclc/24285982 |title=Catalog information for ''The Care Bears and the Whale Tale'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |work=WorldCat |publisher=Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910010416/http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-whale-tale/oclc/24285982 |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Whale-Tale-Picturebacks/dp/0679827641/ |title=Product information for ''The Care Bears and the Whale Tale'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |publisher=Amazon.com Inc |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605073157/http://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Whale-Tale-Picturebacks/dp/0679827641 |archivedate=June 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2002 relaunch ===
In 1999, the rights to the Care Bears franchise were bought by [[Jay Foreman (businessman)|Jay Foreman]], the president of [[Fort Lauderdale]]-based [[Play Along Toys]], for less than $1&amp;nbsp;million; he also planned to acquire fellow American Greeting Cards property Strawberry Shortcake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCall |first=Kimberly L. |title=Sell It, Baby! Practical How-Tos on Marketing, Branding &amp; Sales |page=3 |isbn=1-59113-394-7 |year=2003 |publisher=Booklocker.com, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Kenton Avery Frederick American Greetings relaunched the Care Bear brand as part of the Bears' 20th anniversary celebration with a series of plush toys and movies. The artwork and design of the bears were changed for relaunch. Also, Champ Bear's colours were changed from tan to true blue, with his belly symbol changed to a winner's cup with a star, and Share Bear's belly symbol was changed from a milkshake with two straws to two lollipops crossed. The change to Share Bear's symbol stems from Play Along Toys' suggestion of the change on the grounds that sharing a milkshake may spread germs. Apart from that, many other minor changes were made to the designs, mostly involving lightening the colors of the bears and minor redesigns to the belly symbols.

In the midst of this revival, Play Along released brand new toys based on the newly redesigned Bears, sold at stores such as [[Wal-Mart]], [[Kmart]], [[Toys "R" Us]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[KB Toys]], and [[Mervyns]].&lt;ref name=cbfaq&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/faq/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307224518/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/faq/index.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |archivedate=March 7, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new merchandise included the Bears doing [[aerobics]]; Tenderheart Bear as a patient (casting the child that is playing with the toy as the doctor); Champ Bear as a fireman; and the Care Bears themselves as Cubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304010508/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/new/index.html |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/new/index.html |title=New &amp; Now |archivedate=March 4, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 70 million {{convert|13|in|mm|adj=on}} plush Bears have been sold since the re-launch.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |last=Holmes |first=Elizabeth |title=Care Bears Receive 'Gentle' Makeover |date=February 9, 2007 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |volume=249 |number=33 |page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]] and subsidiary [[Family Home Entertainment|FHE Pictures]], in association with Nelvana, have made two direct-to-DVD computer-animated films, ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' in 2004 and ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' in 2005. Various other music CDs featuring the bears and video games were also produced.

New versions of the various cousins were produced (with Proud Heart being changed back into a cat, in a different color and the same symbol she had in the 1980s franchise). Two of the Cousins, Treat Heart Pig and Noble Heart Horse, were never produced as 13&amp;nbsp;inch plushes in the 2000s, and the Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 relaunch of the franchise.

=== 2007 relaunch ===
In 2007, American Greetings relaunched Care Bears again, first with a series of dolls, then a new movie, ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]'' and immediately before with a new TV series ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]''. The animation and artwork is completely different from the originals giving the Care Bears have smaller body structures and redesigned belly symbols, which are now called belly badges. Also, instead of Nelvana, the film and the animated series are produced by [[SD Entertainment]].

As part of the franchise's 25th anniversary celebrations, the Bears were redesigned by the American Greetings Properties illustration team, as was the logo of the franchise. The line consists of fifteen of the thirty-nine bears (as seen in ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]''). Five of the bears were chosen to be the focus of the franchise: Oopsy Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear and Share Bear. The other bears include Wish Bear, True Heart Bear, Bedtime Bear, Tenderheart Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Harmony Bear, Amigo Bear, Surprise Bear, Superstar Bear, Do Your Best Bear, Best Friend Bear, Play-A-Lot Bear, Heartsong Bear, Good Luck Bear and Hopeful Heart Bear,&lt;ref name="cbcollectlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playalongtoys.com/carebears/collectors/newfall07.aspx |title=Care Bears: New Collection |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=[[Play Along Toys]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829092833/http://www.playalongtoys.com/carebears/collectors/newfall07.aspx |archivedate=August 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the remaining 24 bears are also stated to have a release in the near future according to Play Along Toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playalongtoys.com/carebears/faq.aspx |title=Care Bears FAQ's |format=Flash |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=Play Along Toys |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223132206/http://playalongtoys.com/carebears/faq.aspx |archivedate=December 23, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their new theme song is performed by former [[Letters to Cleo]] member, [[Kay Hanley]], and the music video premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[Nickelodeon]].&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; In August 2007, they appeared in the film ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/interactive/newsStory.php?newsID=2748 |last=Strowbridge |first=C.S. |title=Limited Releases Are Very Becoming |date=August 3, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |work=The Numbers |publisher=Nash Information Services LLC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611082352/http://www.the-numbers.com/interactive/newsStory.php?newsID=2748 |archivedate=June 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the television series from SD Entertainment, ''Adventures in Care-a-lot''. The series premiered on [[CBS]]' ''[[KEWLopolis]]'' block on September 15, 2007.

The Care Bears franchise was [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] upon the 2007 relaunch. Prior plot devices like the Cloudmobiles, Caring Meter, the Cloud Keeper, and even Care-a-lot castle were not referred to or mentioned as of the new series. In its place is the gathering tree, which is where the Care Bears now gather to meet or hold festivities. Also, the Care Bears have, up until the point of the first direct-to-DVD release for the new franchise (''Grizzle-ly Adventures''), never had humans visit Care-a-lot, and a new villain named Grizzle (who seeks to conquer Care-a-lot and nothing else) was introduced. A February 2007 article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' states that in the new version, "they live in a village, centered on a big tree; with no castle in sight".&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt;

However, the Caring Meter made its return in ''Grizzle-y Adventures'', and the second direct-to-DVD release of the franchise, ''Ups and Downs'', included a passing remark regarding the Forest of Feelings. In addition, Care-a-lot castle reappeared in certain scenes in the new game for the V.Smile Baby Infant Development System, ''Play Day''.

On July 23, 2008, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears (along with ''[[Strawberry Shortcake]]'') would be sold to Cookie Jar Entertainment in an acquisition due to take place on September 30, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/article/466030--cookie-jar-buys-care-bears-strawberry-shortcake |author=Associated Press (AP) |title=Cookie Jar buys Care Bears, Strawberry Shortcake |date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |work=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2009, it was announced that Cookie Jar Entertainment had problems in financing the acquisition and that a French company called MoonScoop has also expressed interest in the franchise.

In late 2009, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears will be re-imagined with the launch of a new series, "Care Power Team". This re-imagining re-used the ''Adventures in Care-a-lot'' designs, has the bears sport "enhanced belly badges", and sees the bears taking on emergencies. Soon after, a trio of new films appeared: ''[[Care Bears: Share Bear Shines]]'', ''[[Care Bears: The Giving Festival]]'' and ''Care Bears: To the Rescue''. In the same year, it was announced that the master rights to the toys for the Care Bears have changed hands from Play Along Toys to Hasbro, in a deal that also involved Strawberry Shortcake. However, it was only in mid-2013 that the first Care Bear toys from Hasbro appeared. There has been no word on what caused the delay.

=== 2012 relaunch ===
In July 2011, the card company announced that a new television series, the franchise's first in CGI, is in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/care-bears-star-new-cgi-208438 |last=Bond |first=Paul |title=Care Bears to Star in New CGI-Animated TV Show |date=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[e5 Global Media]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710035247/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/care-bears-star-new-cgi-208438 |archivedate=July 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled ''[[Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot]]'', it premiered on [[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]] on June 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-hub-television-network-unveils-2012-13-program-slate-with-four-new-original-series-joining-eight-returning-original-series-2012-03-01 |author=[[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]] |title=The Hub Television Network Unveils 2012-'13 Program Slate With Four New Original Series Joining Eight Returning Original Series |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=April 17, 2012 |work=[[MarketWatch]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418145726/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-hub-television-network-unveils-2012-13-program-slate-with-four-new-original-series-joining-eight-returning-original-series-2012-03-01 |archivedate=April 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, AG Properties and Mindworks Entertainment announced they will collaborate with [[Sanrio]] for a co-branding with the character franchise ''Little Twin Stars''. An expanded rollout is expected in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/12/04/care-bears-and-little-twin-stars-enter-co-branding-program/ |title=Care Bears and Little Twin Stars enter co-branding program |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215063349/http://kidscreen.com/2013/12/04/care-bears-and-little-twin-stars-enter-co-branding-program/ |archivedate=2013-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, it was announced that Hasbro has lost the rights to making the toys to another toy company called ''Just Play''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidscreen.com/2014/08/12/care-bears-count-down-to-new-toy-line/ |title=Care Bears count down to new toy line |website=Kidscreen |date=August 12, 2014 |access-date=April 29, 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029203238/http://kidscreen.com/2014/08/12/care-bears-count-down-to-new-toy-line/ |archive-date=October 29, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely thought that the reason for the change is due to American Greetings being unhappy with how long it took Hasbro to release a toyline from the time it acquired the rights to make the toys.

In October 2014, When [[Hub Network|The Hub]] changed over to [[Discovery Family]], it was revealed that Welcome to Care-A-Lot has been cancelled and that there won't be further work on the show.

In January 15, 2015, it was revealed that Netflix had commissioned a new series called ''Care Bears and Cousins'' after The Hub cancelled ''Welcome to Care-a-Lot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/13/netflix-care-bears |title=Netflix reviving Care Bears with new series set for 2016 |website=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 13, 2014 |access-date=April 29, 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135123/http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/13/netflix-care-bears |archive-date=May 9, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was originally expected to premiere sometime in 2016, but the release was eventually pushed back to November 2015 and it premiered with six episodes. It was followed by another six episodes.

=== 2018 relaunch ===
In September 2018, a new television series, titled ''Care Bears: Unlock the Magic'', was announced. The series is to premiere on the [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] premium streaming service. The series order includes 48 11-minute regular episodes, two 22-minute specials and 20 shorts.

== Characters and universe ==
{{fanpov|section|date=August 2018}}
{{Main|List of Care Bear characters}}
The franchise consists mainly of the Care Bears themselves, as well as the later additions the Care Bear Cousins. Both of them live in the Kingdom of Caring, which is made up of Care-a-lot (the home of the Care Bears proper) and the Forest of Feelings (home to the Care Bear Cousins). In 1989, Carole Ashkinaze of ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' referred to them as "the whimsical, late 20th-century descendents{{sic}} of what we used to know as [[guardian angel]]s: furry, friendly, adorable creatures whose mission is to guide small children and protect them from bogeymen. Running against a Care Bear is like, well, running against the [[Easter Bunny]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ashkinaze |first=Carole |title=Editorial: In quest to be Mayor, Lomax's Achilles heel was his own image |date=August 11, 1989 |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |page=A23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying them are the Star and Heart Buddies, who look out for the Bears and Cousins whenever they are on missions in caring; and the Birds, who are usually seen in the Forest of Feelings with the Care Bear Cousins and watch over them. A less recurring character is The Cloud Keeper, the portly gentleman who maintains Care-a-lot. He only appeared in some of the franchise's early publications and on the DiC-produced TV episodes.

The ten original Care Bears consisted of Bedtime Bear, Birthday Bear, Cheer Bear, Friend Bear, Funshine Bear, Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Tenderheart Bear, and Wish Bear. Later on, additional bears joined them, as well as the Cousins.

For the new 2007 TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', five of the Care Bears were chosen to be the main characters of the show. As seen on the Care Bears website, they are Share Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear, and the new bear introduced in the movie, Oopsy Bear who would frequently make a mess of things. However, the other Care Bears still make appearances in the series. The unofficial role of leader of the bears, as of the new series, was transferred from Tenderheart Bear to Cheer Bear. The cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 series.

Some elements of the Care Bears franchise pay homage to the legend of [[King Arthur]]. For example, the name of the main characters' residence, Care-a-lot, is a play on King Arthur's legendary [[Camelot]] castle. The Care Bear Family sits around a heart-shaped table, similar to the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] used by Arthur and his knights. In addition, [[Sir Lancelot]]'s name inspired that of Love-a-lot Bear.&lt;ref name=cbsite /&gt;

Throughout the movies and series, various villains have tried to stop the Bears and Cousins in the background on their missions. On the first two specials and DiC television series, they battled against [[Professor Coldheart]], his assistant [[Frostbite (Care Bears)|Frostbite]], and occasionally Auntie Freeze; in Nelvana's version, they faced Wizard No Heart, his bumbling assistant [[Beastly (Care Bears)|Beastly]] and his ill-tempered niece [[Shreeky]], and minor villains such as Dr. Fright and Sour Sam. In the movies, they went up against Nicholas and the Evil Spirit in ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', [[Dark Heart (Care Bears)|Dark Heart]] in ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'', The Wizard of Wonderland and his assistants Dim &amp; Dumb in ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'', and the Rat King and Evil Vizier in ''Care Bears Nutcracker Suite''. Following the 2002 revival, Sir Funnybone the rat was introduced as a villain in the movie ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'', while ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' broke from tradition in that it did not have a villain. For the 2007 revival, the new film ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' introduced new villains, Grizzle and WingNut, who persists into the new TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]''.

=== Magic spells ===
The Care Bears' ultimate weapon is the "Care Bear Stare" (a.k.a. "Belly Magic"), in which the collected Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective belly symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which could bring care and joy into the target's heart. The Care Bear Stare has several different looks. One has a beam coming from the belly being made up of several replicated images of the symbol. Another variation forms a rainbow when multiple Bears and/or Cousins are involved. A yellow beam with red hearts is sometimes seen as well. The movies ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' and ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' do not feature the Care Bear stare, but it does return in ''Oopsy Does It!''. In the new series, ''Care Bears Adventures in Care-a-lot'', the stare appears as a beam of light in the color of the bear from which it originates, but is initiated by simply rubbing the symbol.

In the original animated specials and the DiC series, the Care Bear Stare is initiated by the phrase "Care Bears...prepare to stare!" while in the Nelvana series and later versions it is initiated by the phrase "Care Bears Countdown!"

During the movies and the DiC series, the Care Bear Cousins call their weapon the "Care Bear Cousin Call". In the DiC series, the call looks identical to the Care Bear Stare and is often performed at the same time without it being referred to as the call. In the first movie, the Cousins, excluding Swift Heart Rabbit, simply made whatever animal noise is common to their species since they did not have any belly symbols; those are later given to them by the Care Bears at the end of the movie. In the second movie, the Call looks like a musical score which radiates from their belly symbols. By the start of the Nelvana series, the Care Bear Cousin Call was no longer used and the Cousins simply performed the Care Bear Stare.

Although commonly used on villains, the stare and call have been also been used on humans and the Care Bears themselves. It was occasionally used in the DiC series to cure Care Bears and humans who were placed under the effects of Professor Coldheart's uncaring magic. It also occurred once in ''Adventures in Care-a-lot'', when it was used to temporarily cheer Grumpy up in the episode "Tell-Tale belly".

In addition to the Care Bear Stare, the Care Bears can also use their belly symbols to summon other assistance such as heart-shaped balloons, cloud cars, rainbow bridges and sending out a distress signal.

=== Caring meter ===
Shown prominently in most of the Care Bears movies and TV episodes made in the 80s, the Caring Meter is typically in the dead center of Care-a-lot inside the Care Bears' main meeting hall. This meter shows how much caring there is both in Care-a-lot and on Earth. In the 1980s movies/cartoons, it is shown as an un-numbered clock-like meter. In ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'', the meter is shown with a raincloud (less caring) side and a rainbow (more caring) side. Ideally, the Caring Meter should be all the way towards the rainbow side. Whenever the Bears see the meter drop towards the raincloud side, they try to prevent it from getting worse by going on "caring missions" to try to get more people to care or for the Bears themselves to do caring deeds. If the meter drops near zero, Care-a-lot will suffer disasters, such as [[thunderstorms]], buildings and rainbows crumbling (earlier movies) or the bright colors of Care-a-lot gradually turning into black and white (later movies). If the meter were to reach all the way to zero (there is no caring ''anywhere''), then Care-a-lot would be gone forever.

Initially, no mention was made of the Caring Meter in ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' and the first season of ''Adventures in Care-a-lot''. With the release of ''Grizzle-y Adventures'', the franchise's first direct-to-DVD release, the Caring Meter has returned, and the Care Bears have begun to interact with humans once again.

== Merchandise ==
Apart from toys, books, greeting cards and animated media, the Care Bears have been prominently featured in [[merchandising]] as well, some of which includes gummy bears, party goods, cell phone covers, interior decoration sets, stationery, school supplies, stickers, clothing, accessories and many other goods.&lt;ref name="cbfaq" /&gt; During the early 2000s relaunch, the classic Care Bear toys were available at stores such as Carlton Cards, Claire's, and [[Spencer Gifts]].&lt;ref name="cbfaq" /&gt;

When the franchise was introduced in the 1980s, a mistake was made while manufacturing the stuffed animals causing Bedtime Bear (blue) and Wish Bear (aqua) to swap colors. As soon as the mistake was discovered, the two bears returned into their appropriate colors. Later, a children's story was written explaining why the bears had switched colors.&lt;ref name="cbsite" /&gt;

In his 1986 essay, ''The Shortcake Strategy'', Tom Englehardt referred to the Care Bears dolls as "highly specialized" toys. "So specialized [are they] that instead of being complex individual personalities, they are no more than carefully labeled fragments of a personality", he stated. "Together, they must engage in a series of specialized interventions as complex as those of any real-life medical unit."&lt;ref name=pantheon&gt;{{cite book |last=Engelhardt |first=Tom |editor1-last=Gitlin |editor1-first=Todd |title=Watching Television: A Pantheon Guide to Popular Culture |chapter=Children's Television: The Shortcake Strategy |page=98 |isbn=0-394-74651-1 |year=1986 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] ([[Random House]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Books ==
{{Main|List of Care Bears books}}
Many children's books have been based on, and have featured, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. Some early publications include "Meet the Care Bear Cousins" (based on the first movie), "Sweet Dreams for Sally", "The Witch Down the Street", "The Trouble with Timothy", and "A Sister for Sam". All of these titles were published by toy makers Parker Brothers, who was a licensee of the characters. Over 45 million Care Bears books were sold during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="cbhistory" /&gt; As of 2006, [[Scholastic Press]] has published books based on the Bears' first two CGI films, as well as the new toys, while Modern Publishing publishes a small number of activity and baby books featuring the bears for the toddler market. Publications International and Penny Candy Press are also known to have published a few sound books featuring the bears in the past.

In ''Playing by Different Rules'', a 1988 book chronicling the [[Parker Brothers]]/[[General Mills]] merger, Ellen Wojahn wrote that Parker's Care Bears books (along with those based on sister property Strawberry Shortcake) "were, in fact, little more than illustrated brochures for Kenner's projects—and who knew [by 1984] how long the likes of these characters would remain popular?"&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite book |last=Wojahn |first=Ellen |title=Playing by Different Rules |chapter=Fold |page=217 |isbn=0-8144-5861-0 |year=1988 |publisher=American Management Association (amacom)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comics ==
Between November 1985 and January 1989, the Care Bears appeared in a 20-issue comic book series published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] [[Star Comics]]; the books were drawn by [[DC Comics]] artist Howard Post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/carebear.htm Care Bears] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. Retrieved April 16, 2006. [https://www.webcitation.org/66uZzvdc2?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/carebear.htm Archived] from the original on April 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The November 13, 1986 issue featured a crossover with another American Greetings property, the [[Madballs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scary-crayon.com/print/careballs/ |author="Wes" |title=''Care Bears'' No. 13 ... in which the Care Bears meat the Madballs |year=2008 |accessdate=February 12, 2010 |publisher=Scary-Crayon |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014222444/http://www.scary-crayon.com/print/careballs/ |archivedate=October 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same period, over in Britain the Care Bears also appeared in a comic book series published by Marvel UK with artwork by Mario Capaldi. The periodic comics were later bundled into hardcover Care Bear Annual books. Some of these UK comic book issues also had stories and art from the US comic series.

== Music ==
{{Main|List of Care Bears albums}}
At the height of the '80s Care Bears craze, [[Kid Stuff Records]] released several LPs based on the franchise. These included "Introducing the Care Bears", "The Care Bears Care For You", "Adventures in Care-a-lot", "The Care Bears' Birthday Party", and "The Care Bears' Christmas" (all from 1983), and 1986's "Friends Make Everything Better" (released as a promotion with Trianimic). They released the soundtrack albums for the first two movies. The albums based on the toys were best sellers in children's music during their prime.&lt;ref name="cbhistory" /&gt;

All of the albums from 1983 (except for "Birthday Party") featured writing, production, and performance credits from [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]] (who were the lead singers of [[The Turtles]], also known as [[Flo &amp; Eddie]]; former [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] from [[Frank Zappa]]'s 1970–1972 period). The soundtrack album from [[The Care Bears Movie]] featured songs by [[Carole King]] and [[John Sebastian]], who sang lead for [[The Lovin' Spoonful]].

In the midst of the 2002 revival, [[Madacy Entertainment|Madacy Kids]] released brand new Care Bear CDs. In 2004, ''Meet the Care Bears'', ''Care Bears Holiday Hugs'', ''Care Bears Christmas Eve'', and the ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' soundtrack album came out, as well as ''Care Bears Nighty-Night'' the following year.

The cover of both ''Care Bears Holiday Hugs'' and ''Care Bears Nighty-Night'' advertises another two CDs, called ''Care Bears Share A Smile'' and ''Care Bears Let's Be Friends''. As of April 2008, Both Share A Smile and Let's Be Friends have been folded into a single album and released as a digital download from www.Amazon.com and www.Walmart.com, however it is at this date not available as a physical CD. This has caused some difficulties to international fans as Amazon.com and Walmart.com will not sell digital downloads to fans who reside outside North America.

== Music videos ==
Approximately 50 seconds into the music video for the breakout single "[[I Need Some Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer]]" from Swedish rock band [[The Cardigans]]' sixth studio album ''[[Super Extra Gravity]]'', there is a brief appearance of Bedtime Bear. He is shown again for the last time at the 76th second, lying on a bed in close proximity to the featured dog.

== Video games ==
A Care Bears game was planned for the [[Atari 2600]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="protoCBGame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/carebear/carebear.htm |title=Care Bears |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |publisher=Atari Protos |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103164456/http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/carebear/carebear.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was preliminarily completed and ready for beta testing, but the project was canceled before testing could begin. The [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] prototype subsequently disappeared into obscurity and the only known existing prototype to date is an early [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha]] of the game. No other games featuring the bears were ever made during the period.

In 2004, the Bears starred in their first official game, ''Care-a-lot Jamboree'' for the PC. A few months later, another game featuring the Care Bears for the PC, ''Let's Have a Ball!'' was released. In the same year they were featured in ''Care Bears: A Lesson in Caring'' for the [[V.Smile]] educational game console.

In 2005, they appeared in ''Catch a Star'' (also for the PC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Entertainment briefs column |date=October 15, 2005 |work=[[Ventura County Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Care Bears: Care Quest'' (for the [[Game Boy Advance]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Teachers' Picks: Best New Tech |date=May 1, 2006 |work=Scholastic Parent and Child |publisher=Scholastic Press |volume=13 |number=6 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the movies, no game for any systems was produced in 2006, and no new game was released in time for the 2007 relaunch. However, in August 2008, a new game, ''Care Bears Play Day'', was released for the [[V.Smile]] Baby Infant Development System, finally breaking the two years of silence for the franchise on the gaming front.

them, ''Care Bears Share-A-Story'', was introduced by Play Along in July 2005. The toy is based upon the same basic idea of a [[Teddy Ruxpin]]. The head, mouth and eyes of the Care Bear move around as a cartridge plays fairy tales such as [[The Three Bears|Goldilocks and the Three Care Bears]], [[Jack and the Beanstalk]] and the [[Three Little Pigs]]. A hardback book version of the story comes with it so the parent and child can read along as the story plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.playalongtoys.com/press/pr_050606_CB.aspx |title=Storytime Has Never Been So Magical!

Also, apparently only Share Bear was ever made as such a toy.

Additionally, Care Bears Sing-along pals were also introduced. These Care Bears plush toys sing three different songs while their heads rock back and forth and could synchronize wirelessly with other singing Care Bears of the series to sing together in a group (the effective wireless coverage being three feet, although the range might deteriorate due to environmental conditions and remaining battery strength). While initially introduced in a rather large variety of designs, at the moment only the Share Bear, Cheer Bear and Funshine Bear models are still being made, with the physical appearance of the bears redesigned to match the 25th anniversary looks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Another Care Bear smart toy is the Care Bears Tenderheart Smart Check-up. The toy comes with an interactive plush Tenderheart bear and various toy medical equipment. The interactive plush has soft-touch points throughout the body and can be fully played with without the toy medical equipment.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Lastly, there are a line of Care Bears smart toys that would play hide and seek with the owner. The line, called ''Hide 'N Seek Care Bears'', comes in two designs: Secret Bear and Surprise Bear. Both bear comes with a wireless handpiece. To play the toy, a third party, usually the parent, must partake in the game by hiding the bear. The child then has to find the bear, with the handpiece occasionally providing hints on how close the child is to the bear through audible instructions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''Carlos Antonio Bautista Bettini Francese''' is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] businessman, politician, and diplomat who was the Argentinian ambassador to [[Spain]] and [[Andorra]]. In his youth he was a close friend of [[Nestor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner]], both of whom appointed him to the ambassadorship during their terms as president of Argentina. His appointment to this position was a matter of considerable controversy owing to his background as a lobbyist for Spanish businesses in Argentina.&lt;ref name=embaj&gt;{{cite web |title=Curriculum Vitae del Embajador Carlos A. Bettini |work=Embajada Argentina |url=http://www.embajadaargentina.es/curriculum-vitae-del-embajador-carlos-a-bettini/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120172023/http://www.embajadaargentina.es/curriculum-vitae-del-embajador-carlos-a-bettini/ |archivedate=2014-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bettini, who was a member of the [[Montoneros]], a militant left-wing group of the 1960s and 70s, has been accused to be the perpetrator of a famous murder in 1976. More recently, his activities on behalf of Spanish interests have caused him to face charges of corruption and bribery.

==Early life and education==
Bettini was born on October 13, 1951, in La Plata,&lt;ref name=embaj/&gt; where his family was one of the best known and wealthiest families in the city. In his youth he played [[Rugby football|rugby]] for a club called San Luis.&lt;ref name=urg&gt;{{cite web| title =Carlos Bettini; una biografía del posible sucesor de Aníbal Fernández| work =Urgente 24| date =May 9, 2011| url =http://www.urgente24.com/13716-carlos-bettini-una-biografia-del-posible-sucesor-de-anibal-fernandez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bettini was a friend of Cristina Fernández when they were in their teens in La Plata. Some sources say that they were romantically involved. He knew Cristina five years before they both met Néstor Kirchner. His connections to both Kirchners would end up being pivotal in shaping his political and diplomatic career.&lt;ref name=urg/&gt;&lt;ref name=todo&gt;{{cite web| last =Fundrador| first =Adri| title =Quien es Carlos Bettini?| work =Todo Politica| url =http://todopolitica.foroactivo.com/t4191-quien-es-carlos-bettini}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day he is described as an “intimate” of Cristina Kirchner.&lt;ref name=urg/&gt;

In his early years, Bettini belonged to the Montoneros, a militant left-wing group of the 1960s and 70s, and according to some sources was the principal perpetrator of the “ETA-style” murder of retired Naval Captain Jorge Bigliardi on a street in La Plata on June 12, 1976. It was said that Bettini was able to approach Bigliardi without arousing suspicion because they were friends. Bettini, who went by the alias Soldado Emilio, is said to have committed the crime in collaboration with his brother and another member of the Montoneros. Some sources indicate that his brother-in-law Jorge Devoto, another Naval Captain who lived in the same building as Bigliardi, was another proposed target for assassination by Bettini and his confederates.&lt;ref name=urg/&gt;&lt;ref name=todo/&gt;

Bettini's father, Antonio Bautista Bettini, was a federal prosecutor and a professor at several universities who was “disappeared” in 1977 during the military dictatorship. His brother, Marcelo Gabriel José Bettini, a student of agronomics, was “disappeared” in 1976; Jorge Alberto Daniel Devoto, a Naval Captain who was the husband of Bettini's sister Maria, was “disappeared” in 1977. Bettini's maternal grandmother, María de las Mercedes Hourquebie de Francese, was also “disappeared” in that year.&lt;ref name=urg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Bullentini| first =Ailin| title =Eramos felices hasta esta catástrofe| work =Pagina 12| url =http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-231968-2013-10-24.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roesler"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roesler |first=Pablo |title=La Cacha: Marta Bettini relató cómo fue diezmada su familia por la dictadura |work=Tiempo Argentina |date=Mar 29, 2014 |url=http://tiempo.infonews.com/nota/9830/la-cacha-marta-bettini-relato-como-fue-diezmada-su-familia-por-la-dictadura |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021171555/http://tiempo.infonews.com/nota/9830/la-cacha-marta-bettini-relato-como-fue-diezmada-su-familia-por-la-dictadura |archivedate=2014-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bettini went into exile in [[Spain]] after the disappearances of his family members. He received a law degree in 1986 from [[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]] in Spain.&lt;ref name=embaj/&gt;

==Career==

===Exile in Spain===
In Spain, Bettini became a close friend and political and business ally of [[Felipe González]], the longtime leader of Spain's Socialist Workers' Party. He also had business dealings with Mexican billionaire [[Carlos Slim]], the richest man in the world.&lt;ref name=urg/&gt; In addition, he is said to have befriended a circle of pro-Franco industrialists and members of the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei.

After [[Isabel Martínez de Perón]] was released from Spanish prison and moved to Madrid, Bettini reportedly “approached her and won her confidence” and developed a “close relationship” to her, soon taking the place of Mario Rotundo, who had been in charge of the assets she had inherited from her husband. After he took over this role, Bettini reportedly was an “accomplice” of Argentinian President [[Carlos Menem]] and Isabel Perón in the management of several funds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/878910-la-historia-del-embajador-de-kirchner-que-defendia-a-isabel&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1983 to 1993, he served as an advisor on foreign relations to the Spanish government Ombudsman, a position that during those years was held in turn by Joaquín Ruiz-Giménez Cortés, Álvaro Gil-Robles, and Margarita Retuerto Buades.&lt;ref name=embaj/&gt; He is said to have acquired this job thanks to the influence of González, who also arranged for Bettini to receive Spanish citizenship.&lt;ref name=embaj/&gt;

===Return to Argentina===
Returning to Argentina in 1991, Bettini served between 1993 and 1996 as the director of Aerolineas Argentinas. During part of his tenure in this position, he also worked as a lobbyist in Argentina for Spanish companies.&lt;ref name=andes&gt;{{cite web| last =Teijeiro| first =Carlos Alvarez; Crettaz, Jose| title =Aerolíneas Argentinas se enfrenta a una quiebra inminente y oscura| work =Los Andes| date =Jun 25, 2001| url =http://losandes.com.ar/article/print/articulo/economia-269259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish politician and union leader [[Ariel Basteiro]] called this “the period of greatest depletion” for the airline, explaining that under Bettini's control its interests shifted from Argentina to Spain, specifically toward the Spanish state airline, Iberia. According to Basteiro, Bettini promoted a business strategy for the airline that involved borrowing a hundred million dollars, selling real estate, equipment, and aircraft, and cutting back on services. The result was a significant loss of market share to Iberia.&lt;ref name=kaos&gt;{{cite web| title =Talla ética de inversores europeos en latinoamérica III| work =Kaosenalred| url =
http://old.kaosenlared.net/noticia/talla-etica-inversores-europeos-latinoamerica-iii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the presidency of Carlos Menem, he was a consultant in the Ministry of Justice under Jorge Maiorano, Rodolfo Barra, and Elias Jassán. He was the head of the cabinet of Attorney General Nicolás Becerra from 1998 until Becerra's retirement in February 2004.&lt;ref name=embaj/&gt;&lt;ref name=perio&gt;{{cite web| last =Gasparini| first =Juan| title =Carlos Bettini: un personaje oscuro| work =Periodico Tribuna| date =May 16, 2004| url =http://periodicotribuna.com.ar/637-carlos-bettini-un-personaje-oscuro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years 1993 to 1996, he was also a member of the organizing committee for IDEA (Instituto para el Desarrollo Empresarial de la Argentina) and a member of Patronato de la Fundación Euroamérica. He was Argentina's representative to the annual meeting of the [[UN]] Commission for the [[Prevention of Crime in Vienna]] (1994,1995) and to an international conference of Ombudsmen in [[Wellington, New Zealand]], in 1994.&lt;ref name=embaj/&gt;

In December 1999, Patricia Bullrich, then Minister of Corrections, filed a complaint against Bettini with federal Judge Jorge Urso for corruption, specifically for an attempt to bribe Bullrich herself, in connection with his alleged activity on behalf of a Spanish firm, Dycasa, that sought to secure a contract to build and renovate prisons in Argentina. Bullrich's allegations were studied by the Anti-Corruption Bureau, which suggested prosecuting him, at the very least, on the charge of inappropriate exercise of public functions. Although there was a raid on Bettini's office and a plan was apparently underway to prosecute Bettini, it came to nothing. Proceedings against him were halted, and it was widely argued that this happened because of his high position and connections. It was noted in particular that Becerra, his superior, had close ties to Dycasa.&lt;ref name=kaos/&gt;&lt;ref name=perio/&gt;

On June 2, 2001, Bullrich, then Minister of Labor, said in a television interview “that...no one had shown interest in the proposed privatization of Aerolineas Argentinas” in 1990 and that “Carlos Menem had to personally call Felipe González to ask that Iberia do so.” A report by a committee of experts who ruled that the proposal was inviable "economically and technically” never came to anything.&lt;ref name=andes/&gt;

At one point, Bettini also was the subject of a preliminary probe into charges of conspiracy, involving payments made to benefit the interests of the so-called “Floating Casino.”&lt;ref name=kaos/&gt;

===Ambassador to Spain===
Bettini has been Argentina's Ambassador to the Kingdom of Spain and the Principality of Andorra since August 6, 2004. He has served in this capacity under both President Néstor Kirchner and President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.&lt;ref name=embaj/&gt;

His appointment as ambassador to Spain caused controversy because he had no diplomatic background and was viewed as a lobbyist for Spanish business interests in Argentina.&lt;ref name=rebel&gt;{{cite web| last =Nizkor| first =Equipo| title =Carlos Bettini es un lobbista de las empresas españolas y no tiene perfil diplomático| work =Rebelion| date =May 26, 2014| url =http://www.rebelion.org/hemeroteca/argentina/040526bettini.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Bullrich openly criticized his appointment, saying that it was inappropriate to appoint a lobbyist for Spain to the ambassadorship. Bullrich cited Bettini's alleged actions on behalf of Dycasa, and noted that he had been reported at the time to the Anti-Corruption Bureau. Bettini denied having ever worked as a lobbyist, and announced that he would file a complaint against Bullrich in response to her accusations. Opposition leader Elisa Carrio warned that if he was appointed ambassador, she would “file a criminal complaint for illegal appointment.”&lt;ref name=rebel/&gt;

One source noted that although Bettini, upon being appointed ambassador to Spain, denied ever having been a lobbyist or representative for Spanish companies, stating that such activities would be inappropriate for a public official or diplomat, he had explicitly identified himself in 2000 as a lobbyist for Spanish business and political interests.&lt;ref name=kaos/&gt;

In a 2013 public address by Maria Bettini, the “disappearances” of the Bettini family members were used to contrast the terror and human-rights abuses of the military dictatorship with what Carlos Bettini himself, at that event, described as the benign human-rights policies of the Kirchners.&lt;ref name="Roesler"/&gt;

==Honors and awards==
In 2004 the Kingdom of Spain awarded Bettini the Grand Cross of the [[Order of Isabel the Catholic]], with the degree of Commendation. This award was viewed as a reflection of the closeness of Bettini's relationship with the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party.&lt;ref name=embaj/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaos/&gt;

'''Claudio Marzocco''' (born 21 February 1959) is an Italian engineer and businessman. He is the chief executive officer (CEO) of the [[Marzocco Group]], one of the leading [[real estate development]] companies in [[Monaco]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ellisphere.fr/dirigeant/MARZOCCO-CLAUDIO-19590221 Ellisphere], France.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early career==
In 1983, Marzocco graduated from the [[University of Padova]] with a [[civil engineering]] diploma and started working as an engineer in the construction sector in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telescoop.tv/browse/388714/17/monaco-les-coulisses-du-rocher.html|title=Telescoop.|publisher=Telescoop.tv|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1988, he was kidnapped for two weeks by the Calabria-based mafia [[N'drangheta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,8/articleid,0955_01_1988_0020_0008_12933306/|title=La Stampa.|publisher=Archiviolastamp.it|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kidnappers demanded a ransom from the Marzocco family, but Claudio Marzocco managed to escape after 15 days of abduction. “A week later, my whole family moved to Monaco where we found security for both ourselves and our business”, he said during an interview with French magazine L’Express.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/region/a-monaco-l-empire-de-beton-de-la-famille-pastor_1296649.html|title=L'Express.|work=L'EXPRESS.fr|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marzocco Group==
The Marzocco Group was founded in the 1960s by Domenico Marzocco, father of Claudio Marzocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24heuresactu.com/2013/11/13/groupe-marzocco-une-dynastie-de-constructeurs/|title=24heuresactu.|work=24heuresactu.com|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same year Claudio Marzocco was kidnapped, after moving to Monaco, he established the Marzocco Group in Monaco,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC-seYj5dY4 Montecarlo World Network.]&lt;/ref&gt; which was soon oriented as a real estate development company specializing in luxury buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20130830.AFP3703/a-monaco-les-49-etages-de-la-tour-odeon-attendent-leurs-millionnaires.html|title=Le Nouvel Observateur.|date=30 August 2013|work=nouvelobs.com|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Marzocco group, which is fully owned and managed by members of the Marzocco family, is now considered one of Monaco's leading real-estate development companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekonomico.fr/2013/12/dandros-a-marzocco-les-entreprises-familiales/|title=D’Andros à Marzocco : les entreprises familiales|work=Ekonomico|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Claudio Marzocco is the current{{when|date=October 2014}} company's [[Chief Executive Officer]]. His brothers Luca Marzocco, as well as Claudio’s sons Daniele and Niccolò, as well as his nephew Domenico Della Bella are also board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groupemarzocco.mc/fr/who-we-are/executive-teams|title=Groupe Marzocco Organization Chart.|publisher=Groupemarzocco.mc|accessdate=11 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803075420/http://www.groupemarzocco.mc/fr/who-we-are/executive-teams#|archive-date=2014-08-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
On 14 February 2012, Claudio Marzocco was indicted in France, along with his brother Paolo, in an alleged corruption scandal involving a local politician from [[Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritimes|Beausoleil]] (France).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monacomatin.mc/article/home-page/deux-promoteurs-monegasques-de-la-tour-odeon-mis-en-examen.790930.html|title=Deux promoteurs monégasques de la tour Odéon mis en examen|publisher=Monacomatin.mc|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Collegiate Middle Level Association''' ('''CMLA''') is a student association designed to promote and support the professional development of future middle level teachers, as well as the development and nurturing of middle level education programs.  CMLA is an affiliate of [[National Middle School Association]].  Currently, [[Otterbein College]] is serving as the national host site for the organization's leadership.  Their two-year leadership term will conclude November 2011 with CMLA's annual meeting at NMSA's headquarters in Columbus, OH.

==Purpose of CMLA==

*Advance appropriate middle level education
*Provide information about starting and maintaining an organized group of students involved in middle level education on college and university campuses.
*Support standards and recommendations which enhance middle level concepts, practices and ideas.
*Publicize current middle level employment opportunities.
*Promote and invite collegiate participation at national, state and regional middle level conferences.
*Support and encourage students of middle level education, and inform members of the progress and activities of both CMLA and other student groups via newsletters, electronic technology and other sources of communication.

==Collegiate Middle Level Association: A Historical Perspective==

John Swaim,
CMLA Advisory Chair

The Collegiate Middle Level Association currently has 31 chapters. These 31 chapters represent a growing number of colleges and universities who are now preparing teachers to teach young adolescents in American's [[middle schools]]. This would have been an unthinkable dream for a handful of college students in the middle school teacher education program at the [[University of Northern Colorado]] who were trying to create a national organization for students preparing to become middle school teachers in 1988. At that time there were only 18 states that had [[middle school]] certification or endorsement as opposed to 46 states today. In 1988 middle school teacher education programs were the exception rather than the rule. Even more rare were middle school teacher education programs with active student organizations. As the decade of the 90s began there were only four higher education institutions that had active middle school student groups, [[University of Northern Colorado]], [[University of Northern Iowa]], [[Illinois State University]], and [[Appalachian State University]].

In 1989, under the leadership of Ned Gilardino, a UNC student, a constitution was drafted and the Student Association for Middle Education (SAME) was born. Its name was later changed to Collegiate Middle Level Association (CMLA). That same year CMLA made a presentation to the [[NMSA]] Board of Trustees. The Board recognized CLMA and agreed to help finance them by sharing a percentage of the membership fee of all college students who joined NMSA and had an interest in also becoming a member of CMLA. However, joining by individual membership did not provide the stability that was needed to help the association grow. In fact, when the elections were held the officers often came from several different campuses which made it difficult to conduct the business of the association.

Then, in 1995 two significant events occurred that moved CMLA to a new level. First, NMSA recognized CMLA as an official affiliate member, joining other state middle school associations. Secondly, CMLA moved from an individual membership to a chapter membership. The constitution underwent major revisions that not only changed membership from individual to chapter membership, but also changed how the association would be financed and governed. An advisory board was established consisting of the chapter advisors of all the member chapters. The officers were now elected from one campus that applied and was approved by the Advisory Board to be the host site for a two year term. Financing was more closely aligned with NMSA. The association was able to have two annual meetings rather than just meeting at the NMSA annual conference.

At first CMLA grew slowly under this newly revised structure. However, as more states legislated [[middle school]] teacher licensure and more colleges and universities began to develop middle school teacher education programs, CMLA provided an ever increasing number of prospective middle school teachers the opportunity to become professionally involved as middle level educators.

The following colleges and universities have been leadership host sites for CMLA since the new restructuring: [[Otterbein College]] (2009–Present); [[Georgia College &amp; State University]] (2007-2009); [[University of Dayton]] (2005-2007); [[Ashland University]] (2003-2005); [[Appalachian State University]] (2001-2003); [[Central Michigan University]] (1999-2001); [[Missouri Southern State University]] (1997-1999); and [[Illinois State University]] (1995-1997).

In microeconomics, '''diseconomies of scale''' are the cost disadvantages that [[business|firm]]s and governments accrue due to increase in firm size or output, resulting in production of [[Product (business)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] at increased [[average cost|per-unit cost]]s. This typically follows the [[Diminishing returns|law of diminishing returns]], where further increase in size of output will result in even greater increase in average cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.intelligenteconomist.com/economies-of-scale/|title=Economies of Scale {{!}} Intelligent Economist|date=2017-08-03|work=Intelligent Economist|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is the opposite of [[economies of scale]]. In business,  diseconomies of scale are the factors that lead to an increase in average costs as a business grows beyond a certain size.
[[File:Economies-of-Scale.jpg|alt=economies of scale|thumb|350x350px|The rising part of the [[long run average cost|long-run average cost]] curve illustrates the effect of [https://www.intelligenteconomist.com/economies-of-scale/ diseconomies of scale]. The Long Run Average Cost (LRAC) curve plots the average cost of producing the lowest cost method. The Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) is the change in total cost attributable to a change in the output of one unit after the plant size has been adjusted to produce that rate of output at minimum LRAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.intelligenteconomist.com/economies-of-scale/|title=Economies of Scale {{!}} Intelligent Economist|date=2017-08-03|work=Intelligent Economist|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Causes==

===Communication costs===
Ideally, all employees of a firm would have one-on-one communication with each other so they know exactly what the other workers are doing. A firm with a single worker does not require any communication between employees. A firm with two workers requires one communication channel, directly between those two workers. A firm with three workers requires three communication channels between employees (between employees A &amp; B, B &amp; C, and A &amp; C). Here is a chart of one-on-one communication channels required:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Workers
! Communication Channels

| 4
| 6
|-
| 5
| 10
|-
| n
| &lt;math&gt; \frac{n(n-1)}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
|}
The graph of all one-on-one channels is a [[complete graph]].

The number of one-on-one channels of communication grows more rapidly than the number of workers, thus increasing the time and costs of communication. At some point one-on-one communications between all workers becomes impractical; therefore only certain groups of employees will communicate with one another (e.g. within departments or within geographical locations). This reduces, but does not stop, the increase in unit costs; and also the organisation will incur some inefficiencies due to the reduced level of communication.

===Duplication of effort===
An organisation with just one person cannot have any duplication of effort between employees. If there are two employees, there could be some duplication of efforts, but this is likely to be minor, as each of the two will generally know what the other is working on. When organisations grow to thousands of workers, it is inevitable that someone, or even a team, will take on a function that is already being handled by another person or team. In colloquial terms, this is described as "one hand not knowing what the other hand is doing". [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], for example, developed two in-house [[CAD/CAM]] systems: CADANCE was designed by the GM Design Staff, while Fisher Graphics was created by the former Fisher Body division. These similar systems later needed to be combined into a single Corporate Graphics System, CGS, at great expense. A smaller firm would have had neither the money to allow such expensive parallel developments, nor the lack of communication and cooperation which precipitated this event. In addition to CGS, GM also used [[CADAM]], UNIGRAPHICS, [[CATIA]] and other off-the-shelf CAD/CAM systems, thus increasing the cost of translating designs from one system to another. This endeavor eventually became so unmanageable that they acquired (and then eventually sold off) [[Electronic Data Systems]] (EDS) in an effort to control the situation. Smaller firms typically choose a single off-the-shelf CAD/CAM system, with no need to combine or translate between systems.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Office politics===
"Office politics" is management behavior which a manager knows is counter to the best interest of the company, but is in his personal best interest. For example, a manager might intentionally promote an incompetent worker, knowing that the worker will never be able to compete for the manager's job. This type of behavior only makes sense in a company with multiple levels of management. The more levels there are, the more opportunity for this behavior. In a small company, such behavior could cause the company to go bankrupt, and thus cost the manager his job, so he would not make such a decision. In a large company, one manager would not have much effect on the overall health of the company, so such "office politics" are in the interest of individual managers.

===Top-heavy companies===
As an organisation increases in size, it becomes costly to keep control of a sprawling corporate empire, and this often results in bureaucracy as executives implement more and more levels of management. As firms increase in size, managers will initially provide a net benefit to the firm and increase productivity; however, as a firm grows and covers a larger geographical area and/or employs more people, a [[principal–agent problem]] arises, leading to lower productivity. To counter this, executives introduce standards and controls in order to maintain productivity, and this necessitates the hiring of more managers to apply these standards and controls, hence the proportion of managerial to working class begins to lean towards managerial and the company becomes "top-heavy". However, these additional managers are not providing additional output: they are spending their time implementing standards and carrying out supervision that is unnecessary in smaller firms, hence the cost-per-unit has increased.

==Other effects which reduce competitiveness of large firms==

These do not always increase the cost-per-unit, but do reduce the ability of a large firm to compete.

===Cannibalization===

A small firm only competes with other firms, but larger firms frequently find their own products are competing with each other. A [[Buick]] was just as likely to steal customers from another [[General Motors|GM]] make, such as an [[Oldsmobile]], as it was to steal customers from other companies. This may help to explain why Oldsmobiles were discontinued after 2004. This [[self-competition]] wastes resources that should be used to compete with other firms.

===Isolation of decision-makers from the results of their decisions===

If a single person makes and sells donuts and decides to try jalapeño flavoring, they would likely know on the same day whether their decision was good or not, based on the reaction of customers. A decision-maker at a huge company that makes donuts may not know for many months if such a decision worked out or not, especially if their research or marketing team fails to respond in a timely manner. By that time, the decision-makers may very well have moved on to another division or company and thus see no consequence from their decision. This lack of consequences can lead to poor decisions and cause an upward-sloping average cost curve.

===Slow response time===

In a reverse example, the smaller firm will know immediately if people begin to request other products, and be able to respond the next day. A large company would need to do research, create an assembly line, determine which distribution chains to use, plan an advertising campaign, etc., before any changes could be made. By this time, the smaller competitors may well have grabbed that market niche.

===Inertia (Unwillingness to change)===

This will be defined as the "we've always done it that way, so there's no need to ever change" attitude (see [[appeal to tradition]]). An old, successful company is far more likely to have this attitude than a new, struggling one. While "change for change's sake" is counter-productive, refusal to consider change, even when indicated, is likewise toxic to a company, as changes in the industry and market conditions will inevitably demand changes in the firm in order to remain successful. An example is [[Polaroid Corporation]]'s delay in moving into digital imaging, which adversely affected the company, ultimately leading to bankruptcy.

===Public and government opposition===

Such opposition is largely a function of the size of the firm. Behavior from [[Microsoft]], which would have been ignored from a smaller firm, was seen as an anti-competitive and monopolistic threat, due to Microsoft's size, thus bringing about government lawsuits.

===Large market share===

A small company with only a 1% market share could relatively easily double market share, and hence revenues, in a year. A large company with 50% market share will find it difficult to do so.

===Large market portfolio===

A small investment fund can potentially yield a higher return because it can concentrate its investments in a small number of good opportunities without driving up the purchase price as they buy in, and later sell them without driving down the sale price as they sell off. Conversely, a large investment fund must spread its investments among so many securities that its results tend to track those of the market as a whole. As the size of the market controlled grows, the results will be closer to market average.

===Inelasticity of supply===

A company which is heavily dependent on a resource supply of a fixed or relatively-fixed size will have trouble increasing production.  For instance, a timber company cannot increase production above the sustainable harvest rate of its land (although it can still increase production by acquiring more land).  Similarly, service companies are limited by available labor (and thus tend to concentrate in large, densely-populated metropolitan areas); [[STEM fields|STEM]] (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) professions are often-cited examples.

===Other effects related to size===

Large firms also tend to be old and in mature markets. Both of these have negative implications for future growth. Old firms tend to have a large retiree base, with high associated pension and health costs, and also tend to be [[unionized]], with associated higher labor costs and lower productivity{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. Mature markets tend to only offer the potential for small, incremental growth. (Everybody might go out and buy a new invention next year, but it is unlikely they will all buy cars next year, since most people already have them.)

===Impact on smaller firms===
While diseconomies of scale are typically associated with large mature firms, similar problems have been observed in the growth phase of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. Mclean&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLean|first1=Timothy A.|title=Grow Your Factory, Grow Your Profits: Lean for Small and Medium Sized Manufacturing Enterprises|date=December 2014|publisher=Productivity Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4822-5585-0|url=http://txm.com.au/store/products/grow-factory-grow-profits-lean-small-medium-sized-manufacturing-enterprises}}&lt;/ref&gt; has observed that this can occur once the workforce exceeds around 20 employees. At this point business complexity grows more rapidly than revenue. The business experiences falling productivity, leading to rising variable costs along with rapidly rising overheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLean|first1=Timothy A|title=Lean for Small and Medium Sized Manufacturing Enterprises|url=http://txm.com.au/download-lean-manufacturing-small-medium-sized-enterprise-presentation|website=TXM Lean Solutions|ref=Slides 8-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
Solutions to the diseconomies of scale for large firms may involve splitting the company into smaller organisations. This can either happen by default when the company is in financial difficulties, sells off its profitable divisions and shuts down the rest; or can happen proactively, if the management is willing.

To avoid the negative effects of diseconomies of scale, a firm must stick to the lowest average output cost and try to recognise any external diseconomies of scale. Moreover, on reaching the lowest average cost, a firm must either expand to other countries to increase demand for its products, or seek new markets or produce new products that do not compete with its original products. However, neither of these actions will necessarily eliminate communications and management problems often associated with large organisations.

A systematic analysis and redesign of [[business processes]], in order to reduce complexity, can counter diseconomies of scale. (Of course, this phase of analysis and revamping in itself can be, and usually is, a diseconomy leading to hiring of new personnel and investment in new, competing systems.) This leads to increased productivity. Improved management systems and more effective control of labor and operations can lower overhead.

===Example===

Returning to the example of the large donut firm, each retail location could be allowed to operate relatively autonomously from the company headquarters.

For instance, the local management may decide on the following factors instead of relying on the central management:
# Employee decisions such as hiring, firing, promotions and wage scales, where the local management is directly involved and likely to have better understanding of each employee. For instance, employers may choose to offer higher wages and charge higher prices if they are in an affluent area.
# Purchasing decisions, with each location allowed to choose its own suppliers, which may or may not be owned by the corporation (wherever they find the best quality and prices).
# Research and marketing decisions. Each firm may decide to develop their own recipes or utilise different signature flavour unique to their locale. For instance, when fresh apple cider is available at bargain prices from local farmers in October, they may choose to market a cinnamon donut and hot apple cider combo.
While a single, large, centrally-controlled firm may have higher ability to innovate and develop or market new products more effectively than when its resources are divided, it may lack the flexibility to offer individual customizations. Allowing the different retail locations to make decisions independent of the central management may allow them to meet local consumers' demands more efficiently.

In addition, if the employees own a portion of the local business, employees will also have more vested interest in its success.

Note that all these changes will likely result in a substantial reduction in corporate headquarters staff and other support staff. For this reason, many businesses delay such a reorganization until it is too late to be effective. However, the whole company incurs reputation and legal risks arising from each unit.

Born in 1955, Edgar Jr. ("Efer" to friends)&lt;ref name=cigar-aficianos/&gt;  is the son of [[Edgar Bronfman Sr.|Edgar Miles Bronfman]] and the grandson of [[Samuel Bronfman]], patriarch of one of the wealthiest and most influential [[History of the Jews in Canada|Jewish families in Canada]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The [[Bronfman family]] gained its fortunes through the Seagram Company, an [[alcohol]] distilling company.&lt;ref name=cigar-aficianos/&gt; Edgar Jr. is the second of five children of Ann (Loeb) and Edgar Miles Bronfman. His mother was the daughter of John Langeloth Loeb Sr. (a [[Wall Street]] [[investment banker]] whose company was a predecessor of [[Shearson Lehman]]/[[American Express]]) and [[Frances Lehman]] (a scion of the [[Lehman Brothers]] banking firm). They divorced in 1973.&lt;ref name=NYT-AnnLBronfman-obit&gt;{{cite web|title=Ann L.

== Business career ==
===Film producing===
Bronfman proceeded to a brief career in entertainment in the 1970s as a film and Broadway producer. The summer before his final year of high school, in 1972, he was a credited producer on the film, ''[[The Blockhouse]]''. Despite his inexperience, Bronfman's involvement was accepted because of his connections and access to financing through his family's wealth. His Efer Productions company was signed by [[Universal Studios]] in 1977 to a three-year movie production contract. He produced the unsuccessful film ''The Border''  (1982), which starred [[Jack Nicholson]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Seagram Company===
In 1982, Bronfman returned to the Seagram Company, spending three months learning the ropes before moving to London to become managing director of Seagram Europe. In 1984, Bronfman returned to New York as President of the House of Seagram, the company's U.S. marketing division. By 1994, he became the Chief Executive Officer, where he began a move away from the traditional liquor business and into entertainment. According to ''Cigar Aficionado,'' Edgar Jr. led the family on a series of disastrous business deals, ultimately losing the family's ownership of [[Seagram]].&lt;ref name=cigar-aficianos&gt;[http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,176,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step in this diversification was the widely criticized sale of Seagram's stake in [[DuPont]]. In 1981, Edgar Bronfman Sr. had sold Seagram's stake in [[Conoco]] to DuPont, in exchange for almost 25% of the chemical giant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edgar-Miles-Bronfman|title=Edgar Miles Bronfman {{!}} Canadian-born American businessman and philanthropist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stake in DuPont, by 1995, represented about 70% of Seagram's total earnings. Nevertheless, Bronfman Jr., acting as Seagram CEO, approached DuPont about buying back its shares, a deal that DuPont wasted no time in closing.

With the proceeds of the $9 billion sale, Bronfman Jr. went on an expansion into the entertainment business, in music through the acquisition of [[Polygram]], and in film entertainment through [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] and [[Universal Pictures]]. However, the new entertainment conglomerate he created had a brief life, before needing a strategic partner. Bronfman Jr., then led Seagram into a controversial all-stock acquisition by French conglomerate [[Vivendi]] in 2000. Bronfman Jr., became chief of the new company, Vivendi Universal, but the Seagram company effectively lost control of its entertainment businesses. Meanwhile, the beverage division—the core of Seagram was acquired by [[Pernod Ricard]] and [[Diageo]] and divided between the two firms. Seagram, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist.

In December 2001, Bronfman announced he was stepping down from an executive capacity at Vivendi Universal, but remaining as vice chair of the board.

In 2002, Bronfman joined private investment firm Accretive LLC as General Partner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accretivellc.com/team_members/edgar-bronfman-jr/ "Edgar Bronfman Jr."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914021803/http://www.accretivellc.com/team_members/edgar-bronfman-jr/ |date=2013-09-14 }} Retrieved 2013-07-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The firm focuses on conducting deep market research and hand-selecting firms to back. Among its past projects are [[Accretive Health]] and [[Fandango (ticket service)]]. Companies it currently backs include [[human resources]] firm AlphaStaff and small-business insurance company [[Insureon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accretivellc.com/portfolio/ "Our Companies | Accretive LLC"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914021738/http://www.accretivellc.com/portfolio/ |date=2013-09-14 }} Retrieved 2013-07-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warner Music Group===
On February 27, 2004, Bronfman finalized the acquisition of Warner Music Group and served as Chairman and CEO of the music company for the following 7 years. Bronfman helped to transform WMG by rapidly growing the company's digital music sales, redefining the relationships it has with artists and diversifying its revenue streams through its expansion into growing areas of the music business.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Michael. [http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/147/take-us-to-the-river.html], ''Fast Company'', "How Warner Music and Its Musicians Are Combating Declining Album Sales", 1, July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; WMG held an initial public offering of stock in 2005 (NYSE: WMG), and is now the only standalone major music company to be publicly traded. While the stock has fallen from a high in 2005 of over $30 per share, the company has nonetheless produced double-digit growth in its digital business, increased its market share and delivered stable revenue performance despite a drastic music industry decline during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Rob. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/25/business/25views.html "Warner Music Is Singing Again"], ''The New York Times'', 24 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, ''The New York Times'' reported that WMG's Atlantic Records became the first major record label to generate more than half of its music sales in the U.S. from digital products.&lt;ref&gt;Arango, Tim. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/business/media/26music.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business "Digital Sales Surpass CDs at Atlantic"], ''The New York Times'', 25 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 2011, WMG and Bronfman [[Warner Music Group#2010s|announced]] the company's sale to [[Access Industries]] for US$3.3 billion cash. Access is controlled by Russian-born billionaire [[Len Blavatnik]], a former board member and still-substantial shareholder of WMG at the time of the purchase announcement. The sale, coming after a three-month bidding process, "serves the best interests of stockholders as well as the best interests of music fans, our recording artists and songwriters, and the wonderful people of this company," according to a statement released by Bronfman.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ethan, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703859304576306993963966516 "Deal Values Warner Music at $3.3 Billion"], ''Wall Street Journal'', May 6, 2011. Retrieved 2011-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt; CEO Bronfman would continue in his post in the transaction, though further job cuts were also foreseen. The investment group which has owned the company since 2004 was said to have received a positive return on its investment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/person-tells-ap-access-industries-buying-warner-music-group-for-13-billion/2011/05/06/AFL7607F_story.html "Warner Music Group being sold for $1.3 billion to Access Industries amid industry decline"], ''[[Associated Press]]'' via ''[[Washington Post]]'', May 6, 1:38 PM EDT.

===Waverley Capital===
In 2017, it was announced that Bronfman would be launching a new venture capital firm called Waverley Capital, alongside Luminari Capital founder Daniel Leff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hu|first1=Cherie|title=Former Warner Music CEO Edgar Bronfman Jr. Launches VC Firm for Early-Stage Media Startups|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8022084/edgar-bronfman-jr-former-warner-music-ceo-vc-firm-media|accessdate=30 March 2018|publisher=Billboard|date=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This firm would invest in "innovative and disruptive" companies within both technology and entertainment, with offices in New York and Palo Alto, California, with a Los Angeles office expected to open in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Edgar Bronfman Jr. Forms Media Venture-Capital Firm With Luminari’s Daniel Leff|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/edgar-bronfman-jr-waverley-capital-luminari-daniel-leff-1202602380/|accessdate=30 March 2018|publisher=Variety|date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
In 1973, Bronfman began a songwriting career under the pseudonyms Junior Miles and Sam Roman. He often collaborated with [[Bruce Roberts (singer)|Bruce Roberts]] on songs like "Whisper in the Dark", which he gave to [[Dionne Warwick]] to record in thanks for introducing him to his first wife, Sherry. Bronfman also co-wrote  "[[To Love You More]]", which was recorded by [[Celine Dion]], and [[Barbra Streisand]]'s "If I Didn't Love You".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Personal life ==
Edgar M. Bronfman, Jr., is the son of [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.]], the billionaire businessman and longtime president of the [[World Jewish Congress]] who died aged 84 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/22/edgar-bronfman-seagram-boss-dies-84&lt;/ref&gt; He is the half-brother of [[Clare Bronfman]], who as a 39-year-old was charged in 2018 in a [[NXIVM]] sex-trafficking case.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44946059&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Bronfman married his first wife, Sherry Brewer, an [[African-American]] actress, in [[New Orleans]]. Bronfman's father did not approve of the marriage. "I very much wanted for him to end the relationship, because I told him, all marriages are difficult enough without the added stress of totally different backgrounds", Bronfman Sr. wrote in his memoirs. "Sherry offered to convert [to Judaism], which though well intentioned, was not the point."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708112137/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n17_v93/ai_21237697/ "Seagram chairman admits he never approved of son's marriage to a Black woman"], ''Jet'', March 23, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Bronfman married Clarisa Alcock San Román, a Catholic, the daughter of Frank Alcock Pérez-Matos, a Venezuelan oil executive of half [[British people|British]] descent, and Dinorah San Román Strup, her [[Venezuelan]] mother,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sologenealogia.com/gen/getperson.php?personID=I84109&amp;tree=001 Solo Genealogia: Clarisa Alcock San Román] retrieved April 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/macleans/bronfman-sells-dupont Maclean's Magazine quoted by The Canadian Encyclopedia Historica: "Bronfman Sells DuPont"] April 17, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; They have four children: Aaron, Bettina, Erik, and Clarissa.

== Insider trading conviction ==
On January 21, 2011, Bronfman was found guilty in French court of [[insider trading]] as Vivendi chief and received a 15-month suspended sentence and a €5m fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b1fe91f6-2565-11e0-93ae-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=rss#axzz1BhZVEIBc|title=Ex-Vivendi executives found guilty|accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stance on music copyright infringement ==
At the height of [[file sharing]] service [[Napster]]'s popularity, Bronfman was a leading opponent of the illegal use of [[peer-to-peer]] technology. As CEO of Universal, he helped lead the music industry's opposition to Napster, likening it to slavery and Soviet communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2000/09/mann.htm|work=[[The Atlantic Monthly]]|author=Charles C. Mann|date=2000-09-01|title=The Heavenly Jukebox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, WMG was the first major media company to create a business model around user-generated content and, more recently, has been pushing for ways to monetize the popularity of P2P networks on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globaltechforum.eiu.com/index.asp?layout=rich_story&amp;doc_id=9388&amp;categoryid=&amp;channelid=&amp;search=disclose Warner makes deal with YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2008/12/warner-music-gr/ Three Major Record Labels Join the 'Choruss']&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2006 in an interview with Reuters, Bronfman caused a stir by admitting that his children have copyright infringing music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20061204/003837.shtml|work=TechDirt|date=4 December 2006|title=Will The Recording Industry Sue Edgar Bronfman For Downloading?}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims to have delivered punishment for this but wants it to remain within the realm of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://secondlife.reuters.com/stories/2006/12/01/warner-music-boss-edgar-bronfman/ |work=[[Reuters]] |author=Adam Reuters |date=1 December 2006 |title=Interview: Warner Music Group boss Edgar Bronfman |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220015535/http://secondlife.reuters.com/stories/2006/12/01/warner-music-boss-edgar-bronfman/ |archivedate=2007-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lately, Bronfman may have revised his judgment. During the GSMA Mobile Asia Congress, he told the audience that mobile operators should not make the same mistakes that the music industry has:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/11/14/warner-music-boss-we-were-wrong/|work=techcrunch|author=Duncan Riley|date=14 November 2007|title=Warner Music Boss: We Were Wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We used to fool ourselves ... We used to think our content was perfect just exactly as it was. We expected our business would remain blissfully unaffected even as the world of interactivity, constant connection and file sharing was exploding. And of course we were wrong. How were we wrong? By standing still or moving at a glacial pace, we inadvertently went to war with consumers by denying them what they wanted and could otherwise find and as a result of course, consumers won.}}

In 2010 Bronfman changed his philosophy on the music industry's online business models, stating that he does not support free advertising supported models. He said that WMG will focus on promoting services that require payment, that will appeal to the population that already pays for downloads in stores such as [[iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8507885.stm|work=BBC|author=Ian Youngs|date=10 February 2010|title=Warner retreats from free music streaming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The 'get all your music you want for free, and then maybe with a few bells and whistles we can move you to a premium price' strategy is not the kind of approach to business that we will be supporting in the future.}}

Upon his return from the United States, Verano started a career as a business administrator, combined with his militancy in the [[Colombian Liberal Party]]. Between 1978 and 1984 Verano was appointed manager of ''Cementos del Caribe'', a Colombian cement company. In 1984 he was appointed general manager of the ''Empresa Municipal de Teléfonos de Barranquilla'', the local state owned telephone company of Barranquilla. From 1986 until 1990 Verano was the appointed general manager of the ''Electrificadora del Atlántico'', Barranquilla's state owned electricity company.

In December 1990, representing the Colombian Liberal Party under the support of [[Horacio Serpa]], Verano ran for a seat in the [[Constituent Assembly of Colombia]] and was elected. The Constituent Assembly drafted and approved the [[Colombian Constitution of 1991]].

During the mandate of President [[César Gaviria]], Verano was appointed Director of the National Institute of Radio and Television, INRAVISION (''Instituto Nacional de Radio y Televisión'') in 1992. Between 1992 and 1994 Verano served as general manager of the ''Corporación Eléctrica de la Costa'', Corelca, the electric company that controlled the energy in most of the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia]].

After the triumph of Liberal party candidate [[Ernesto Samper]] for the presidency of Colombia in 1994, Verano postulated himself for the Mayorship of Barranquilla but was defeated by Edgar George. President Samper then appointed him as Presidential Advisor to the Caribbean Region of Colombia until 1997 when he was then appointed as [[Ministry of Environment (Colombia)|Minister of Environment]] in which he served until the end of the Pastrana administration.

===Secretary General of the Colombian Liberal Party===

In 1999 Verano was elected by the Liberal Party as Secretary General of the Colombian Liberal Party and later reelected in 2001. During his four years as Secretary General, Verano participated in the association of the party with the [[Socialist International]], he also modernized and pushed forward the internal democratization of the party after the Liberal Constitution of 2000-2003 which concludes with internal elections. After these elections Verano resigned.

In the internal elections of 2003 to select the candidate for the Governorship of Atlántico Department, Verano ended in second place behind Fernando Borda, who was supported by Senator [[José Name]], despite this Borda was defeated in the general elections. After these elections Verano dedicated himself to private businesses and affairs until 2005. In 2005 Horacio Serpa asked Verano to manage Serpa's third attempt to become president of Colombia, but in May 2006 Serpa ended up third in the presidential race.

===Governor of Atlántico===

Verano then decided to participate in the [[Colombian regional election, 2007|Colombian regional elections]] of October 28, 2007 by postulating his name for the Governorship of Atlántico Department. In the internal election of the Colombian Liberal Party Verano was the only candidate for what the president of the Liberal party, Cesar Gaviria decided to cancel the elections, but later Verano was reaffirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.partidoliberal.org.co/root/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1368&amp;Itemid=16 Partido Liberal Colombiano - Resolución No1391 Eduardo Verano de la Rosa es el candidato a Gob. de Atlántico&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After this polls showed that Verano had a slightly preference among the opinion and above the other possible candidate [[José Name]]. In some polls both candidates were technically in a tie. Verano then received the support of other candidates Jaime Amín, Marieta Morad and Alfredo Palencia that allowed him to gain the support necessary to win. He was scheduled to assume office on January 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com.co/paisonline/notas/Octubre252007/poli02.html El Pais - Cali Colombia nacional Cerrada disputa por la Alcaldía de Cali Cerrada disputa por la Alcaldía de Cali&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Ntalami was educated at [[Strathmore University]] (formerly ''Strathmore College''), where in 1974 he qualified as a Fellow of the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) of the United Kingdom. He took up employment with [[Housing Finance Company of Kenya]] (HFCK) Limited then, aged 28, was awarded a three-year scholarship by the Government of Kenya to pursue a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degree from the [[University of Sheffield]], England. He then returned to his homeland, where in 1979 he qualified as a member of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants (CPA), [[Kenya]]. He died on 20 November 2014 after a long battle with cancer at the age of 67.

==Career==
[[File:Financial Masters.jpg|none|thumb|280px|Ntalami (seated first from right) at a retreat with leading stock exchange and capital markets officials. Windsor Golf and Country Club, [[Nairobi, Kenya]].]]

In 1970 he became an [[audit]] trainee with the City Council of [[Nairobi]] for two years. He later joined [[Magadi Soda Company]] (MSC) Limited, a mineral mining company, serving as an Assistant Accountant. After two years at the company, Ntalami joined international audit firm [[Ernst and Young]]. He served as a senior audit assistant, then transferred to Housing Finance Company of Kenya (HFCK) Limited, a local real estate financier, as Senior Accountant for three years.

Ntalami later served as Chief Accountant, and later, Ag. CEO, for [[Kenya Airways]] for four years.

The early 1980s, which was billed as the golden moment for local indigenous accounting firms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3492&amp;Itemid=5813] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ntalami became a [[Partner (business rank)|partner]] at Kimani Onyancha &amp; Company, a medium size firm of Certified Public Accountants involved primarily in the provision of statutory audits. He held special responsibility for the management consultancy services (MCS).

After ten years with KO&amp; Co., he became a stockbroker in 1995. He served as Executive Director for Sterling Securities Limited (SSL), a then fledgling [[brokerage firm|stock broking firm]].

Here, Ntalami participated in a number of private and public share issues and flotation, including [[initial public offerings]] (IPOs), [[divestiture]], and [[privatisation]] of public enterprises. At its peak in 1996, SSL was retained by [[Kenya Commercial Bank]] (KCB) as a sponsoring broker during its third share issue.

By 1998 the Sterling Securities Limited partnership was dissolved and, on 11 August 1999, SSL was suspended from trading on the NSE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/130899/News/News34.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092830/http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/130899/News/News34.html |archive-date=29 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but later resumed its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbendi.co.za/orgs/ccjw.htm|title=Africa Business Newsletter - Best Business Informations|website=Africa Business Newsletter|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the unexpected restructuring of the stockbroking business, Ntalami left to open and operate a Financial and Investment consultancy firm, Marited Associates. After two years, in December 2002 he was appointed Chief Executive of the Capital Markets Authority by the President replacing Paul. K. Melly, following a major cabinet and [[Civil Service|public service]] reshuffle.

===Capital Markets Authority (CMA)===

A new chairman, [[Chege Waruinge]], the [[Vice-Chancellor]] of Gretsa University and Dean Professor Academic Affairs, United States International University (USIU), was also appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mashada.com/forums/politics/4415-kibaki-makes-changes-30-parastatals.html|title=Chyulu News - Breaking News from Africa|website=Mashada.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 2009 Waruinge, tendered his resignation to the regulator's board.

Ntalami completed his term in office on 17 December 2007, and did not renew his contract. His departure was immediately followed by the exit of [[Christine Mweti]], the Head of Legal Services who was second in command at CMA, who since moved to [[Renaissance Capital (Russian company)|Renaissance Capital]]. [[Stella Kilonzo]], was appointed the CMA acting chief executive, and confirmed as CEO on 15 July 2008

====Highlights of tenure====
[[File:CMA-Kenya.jpg|thumb|right|110px|CMA logo]]
Some of the key events that have characterised the Chief Executive's tenure include:
* '''Kenya Re initial public offering:'''

The Government sold 40 per cent of its stake in the 37-year-old [[reinsurance]] firm, or 240 million shares, through an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) at the [[Nairobi Stock Exchange]] (NSE). The IPO opened on 18 July 2007, and closed on 31 July 2007. The IPO was oversubscribed by an average of 363.5 per cent with the retail segment, recording the highest oversubscription of 715 per cent. For the first time ever, the transaction team implemented the [[delivery versus payment]] (DVP) method, which allowed institutional investors and insurance firms to hold off payment until the share allocation was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200708061780.html|title=Kenya Re IPO Oversubscribed By 334 Percent|first=Michael|last=Omondi|date=6 August 2007|accessdate=30 May 2018|website=AllAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenya Reinsurance shares closed their first day of trading at KSh15.75. This was 65.78 per cent higher than the share offer price of Sh9.50 a share, a significant gain for shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=44639 |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022093629/http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=44639 |archive-date=22 October 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200708281056.html|title=Kenya Re Share Price Drops Sharply On Second Day of Trading|first=Allan|last=Odhiambo|date=28 August 2007|accessdate=30 May 2018|website=AllAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''NSE revises stock market index:'''

On 20 July 2007, the [[Nairobi Stock Exchange]] (NSE) revised the companies listed on its main share index to replace inactive stocks. The 20-Share Index is a reflection of the twenty (20) most actively trading counters in Kenya and was last reviewed in May 2003.

In the financial sector, ICDCI replaced NIC Bank, while in the industrial sector; KenGen replaced BOC Gases, whose shares were suspended following the proposed merger with [[Carbacid Investments]] (see below). In the Agricultural sector, [[Rea Vipingo]] replaced Kakuzi, whereas, [[Mumias Sugar]] Company replaced Unilever Tea. In the Commercial and Service Sector, CMC replaced [[Uchumi]] Supermarkets Limited (under receivership&amp;nbsp;– see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200707201166.html|title=Kenya: NSE in Major Shake Up of 20-Share Index Companies|first=Washington|last=Gikunju|date=20 July 2007|accessdate=30 May 2018|website=AllAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://africa.reuters.com/business/news/usnBAN048907.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218164747/http://africa.reuters.com/business/news/usnBAN048907.html |archive-date=18 December 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review of the NSE 20-share index was done to bring on board newly listed firms with active trading track-records and would see the NSE [[market capitalisation]] increase substantially with the entry of the profitable firms from the country's fastest growing [[economic sectors]]. It is expected that this will give the market a better image, which reflects the true value of the [[:wikt:bourse|bourse]] as opposed to retaining less active stocks in the Index. [http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90778/6220960.html] [http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=43883]
* '''AccessKenya initial public offering:'''

On 4 June 2007 the AccessKenya Group was listed on the [[Nairobi Stock Exchange]], becoming the first [[Information Communication Technology]] (ICT) company to do so. The web firm, which provides wireless access and email, said the listing for 800 million Kenyan shillings (US$11.9 million) was oversubscribed by 363% with every category, from wealthy investors to institutional investors being fully subscribed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.reuters.com/business/news/usnBAN437638.html] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=42949 |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041652/http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=42949 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPO also heralded the creation of a fifth investment segment at the bourse&amp;nbsp;– the technology sector. This is in addition to the already existing agricultural, commercial and services, finance and investment and industrial and allied sectors.

The shares began trading at Sh14 with 1,000,000 shares changing hands within an hour of the opening bell.
* '''The Carbacid Investments vs BOC Group tussle:'''

An attempted takeover bid of [[Carbacid Investments]] by [[The BOC Group|BOC Group]] was aborted after the capital markets regulator declined to endorse the deal. In May 2006, the CMA argued that the latter had not met all the terms it had stated in an offer to Carbacid shareholders. The critical condition in the deal to warrant the takeover and subsequent delisting of Carbacid from the NSE was that at least 80 per cent of Carbacid shareholders had to back the takeover transaction, but only owners holding 71.0 per cent backed the transaction. Ironically, a ruling by the Capital Markets Tribunal okayed the takeover forcing the CMA to appeal against the ruling. Mr Ntalami said the approval of the takeover deal was likely to set a bad precedent that would plunge future takeovers of listed companies into chaos.

The protracted takeover saga, that has seen the two counters suspended for over four(4) years was resolved in November 2009, as trading in carbon dioxide manufacturer Carbacid shares resumed after suspension since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastandard.net/InsidePage.php?id=1144029882&amp;cid=14] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Electronic trading commences at the NSE:'''

On 11 September 2006 the Nairobi Stock Exchange migrated from the hitherto Open Outcry system to the Automated Trading System (ATS), an electronic trading platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=39141 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041637/http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=39141 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The President commissioned the new technology on 25 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kenyanewsnetwork.com/artman/publish/article_1363.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101040615/http://www.kenyanewsnetwork.com/artman/publish/article_1363.shtml |archive-date=1 November 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change is expected to double the value of shares traded each day on the bourse with enhanced integrity and efficiency. Investors are now able to access current information thus facilitating them to make informed investment decisions on timely basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news_s.php?articleid=1143958077 |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914071105/http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news_s.php?articleid=1143958077 |archive-date=14 September 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 2007, the NSE completed its migration from the open outcry trading floor method to an all encompassing [[Wide Area Network]] (WAN) trading system which allows stockbrokers to trade from the comfort of their offices.
* '''Equity Bank listing:'''

Listing and official trading of Equity Bank shares on the NSE commenced on 7 August 2006; a day which saw the price move from Kes. 70 to Kes. 158 in a single price setting deal involving 1000 shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/print/news.php?articleid=1143956462 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007113526/http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/print/news.php?articleid=1143956462 |archive-date=7 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''ScanGroup Ltd. IPO:'''

On 17 July 2006, the [[initial public offering]] of Scangroup Limited shares kicked off what was to be a historical listing at the NSE. Scangroup, became the first marketing services company in Africa to go public through an IPO. The advertising house, an intelligence-intensive outfit, offloaded 69 million company shares into the capital markets at an offer price of Kes 10.45 per share. The IPO was oversubscribed by 520% and official trading of the company's shares on the NSE) commenced on 29 August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastandard.net/mag/mag.php?id=1143955486&amp;catid=50 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007113444/http://www.eastandard.net/mag/mag.php?id=1143955486&amp;catid=50 |archive-date=7 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scangroup share price rose by 39% on its first day of trading to close the day at Kes. 15 with 3, 056,000 shares exchanging hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=1143956445 |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174536/http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=1143956445 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''KenGen IPO:'''

In April 2006, the Government offloaded 659.51 million shares in Kenya Electric Generating Company (KenGen) through the [[capital markets]]. The IPO premiered at the NSE at a discounted price of Kes. 11.90 price before rallying to a high of Sh40, representing a massive fourfold jump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastandard.net/mags/fs/news.php?articleid=1143952893 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010050930/http://www.eastandard.net/mags/fs/news.php?articleid=1143952893 |archive-date=10 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the IPO is credited for spurring the current appetite and excitement for investing in Kenya.

On 25 April 2007, an intended secondary offer for the shares, in pursuance of the IPO's initial success, was abruptly postponed by former Finance Minister [[Amos Kimunya]] attributing the move to the prevailing share price being very low and the bulk tariff conflict between Kengen and KPLC. [http://www.timesnews.co.ke/20may07/insight/ins1.html]
* '''CFCStanbic Bank rights issue:'''

On 23 December 2005, CFCStanbic Bank officially listed 12.0 million new shares, arising out of its successfully completed rights issue. The bank succeeded in raising the Kes. 744 million (US$10 million) needed to align its capital base with Central Bank of Kenya risk management guidelines.
* '''Uchumi Supermarkets rights issue:'''

In October 2005, the retail chain, already facing serious financial challenges, received approval from the CMA for its shareholders to inject an extra Kes. 1.1 billion (US$15 million) through a rights share issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.newratings.com/analyst_news/article_1040804.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040444/http://www.newratings.com/analyst_news/article_1040804.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, a year after the near-collapse of the retail supermarket, attention shifted to renewed efforts toward the retail chain's tortuous recovery strategy. The company's receiver-managers, led by Mr Jonanthan Ciano, offered shareholders yet another chance to inject Sh800 million (U.S$. 11.4 million) into the company under a new recapitalisation plan. Analysts then observed that were the plan to fail due to shareholder reluctance, the retail chain would have to find a new equity partner to fund its recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allafrica.com/stories/200705160997.html] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2114&amp;Itemid=5812 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151420/http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2114&amp;Itemid=5812 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''KCB rights issue:'''

The highly successful [[Kenya Commercial Bank]] rights issue in September 2004, mobilised in excess of Kes. 2.3 billion (US$31 million) needed for the bank's growth strategy. The rights offer for 50 million shares at a price of Kshs 49.00, was oversubscribed by 12.25%, necessitating a refund of Kes. 310 million (US$4.1million) to applicants following shortage of untaken rights for allotment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.firstglobalselect.com/scripts/cgiip.wsc/globalone/htm/news_article.r?vcnews-id=27 |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819144142/http://www.firstglobalselect.com/scripts/cgiip.wsc/globalone/htm/news_article.r?vcnews-id=27 |archive-date=19 August 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Kenya's secondary bond market voted among the best in Africa: A report released by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), in April 2007, ranked Kenya's secondary [[bond market]] as among the most vibrant in Africa, coming only third to South Africa and [[Mauritius]].

* The overwhelming success of the KenGen IPO was widely commended for generating a lot of awareness in investments among ordinary Kenyans of all ages, professions and income levels. The landmark IPO led to a massive interest in opening stock brokerage accounts and investing in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesnews.co.ke/02may06/business/buns2.html|title=Times News - Bold, Authoritative, and True|website=Times News|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news_s.php?articleid=1143952641&amp;date=18/5/2006] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Central Depository and Settlement Corporation (CDSC), the number of people with CDS accounts increased significantly and as at the end of June 2007 stood at over 750,000 accounts up from 78,300 in December 2005; a noteworthy tenfold increase in only one-and-a-half years.
* Many have also commended Ntalami for his resolve in rejecting plans to use a bookbuilding approach to allocate the KenGen shares. The initial plan is said to have been abandoned after it appeared to be biased against the small investor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenyanmarket.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=49] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under Ntalami's watch at the healm, the NSE 20 Share Index posted a historic mark, surpassing its previous all-time high of 5,030 points, hit on 18 February 1994. As at close of trading on 10 November 2006 it stood at 5654.46 points.

[[File:Kenya-Re IPO launched.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Nelius Kariuki, the Kenya Reinsurance MD, rings the bell during the opening of the Kenya Re IPO. Looking on (back-left) is former CMA CEO Edward Ntalami.]]
* For over a decade since March 1996, the NSE had only listed three new companies, namely [[Kenya Airways]], [[Mumias]] and ICID-I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nse.co.ke/History.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104002912/http://www.nse.co.ke/History.htm |archive-date=4 November 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In under four years of the former Chief Executive's tenure, the bourse witnessed the successful launch of six IPOs, namely KenGen, Scangroup, [[Eveready Battery Company|Eveready]] East Africa (listed with an oversubscription of over 800%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eveready.co.ke/pdf/IPO_results_announcement.pdf] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Mumias Sugar]] and AccessKenya Group (listed with an oversubscription of 363%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200705150699.html|title=Kenya: AccessKenya IPO Oversubscribed, Trading Starts on June 4|first=Fred|last=Oluoch|date=15 May 2007|accessdate=30 May 2018|website=AllAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and recently Kenya Re ''(see photo (right))''; including the oversubscription of five Rights Issues, namely KCB Bank, CFCStanbic Bank, Uchumi Supermarkets, Diamond Trust and Olympia Capital. Ntalami left office just prior to the landmark listing of [[Safaricom]], the leading mobile telecommunications service provider in the country.
* The Year of the IPO: 2006 was hailed as "The Year of the IPO" by Madabhushi Soundarajan, former managing director, CFCStanbic Bank and CFC Financial Services. "You can call 2006 the Year of the Initial Public Offer where many Kenyans saw the benefit of the stock market to make wealth" he said, through a supplement/advertising feature released in the country's leading newspaper, ''Daily Nation'' on 13 December 2006. CFCStanbic Bank is part of the CFCStanbic Group whose Total Assets then stood at over KShs 16 billion. In line with this, [[James Murigu]], the former managing director of Suntra Investment Bank, has commended the CMA's pace in processing of new applications for bourse listings.
* The CMA has been lauded by the private sector and newly listed companies for reviving confidence in Kenya's capital markets which has in turn translated into active participation from both manufacturing and service sectors. In August 2007, [[Renaissance Capital (Russian company)|Renaissance Capital]] – a major multinational [[investment bank]], was granted license to operate in Kenya. RenCap commended the regulator for the speedy processing of its application which showed its commitment to deepening the [[capital markets]] in Kenya.&lt;ref name="bdafrica.com1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2197&amp;Itemid=5812 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151401/http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2197&amp;Itemid=5812 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bdafrica.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2160&amp;Itemid=5844 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151232/http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2160&amp;Itemid=5844 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Investor Education and Awareness Programmes: On 30 January 2006 the CMA hosted a major Workshop at the Grand Regency Hotel, Nairobi, inviting leading media houses, journalists and industry players, both local and international, to train them on the tenets of good capital markets reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ke.undp.org/JournalistsWorkshopCMA.doc |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613082530/http://www.ke.undp.org/JournalistsWorkshopCMA.doc |archive-date=13 June 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMA also participated in the Mombasa and Nairobi Agricultural Society of Kenya (ASK) shows in August and October 2006 respectively, where the Authority won an award for the Best Financial Institutions stand at the Mombasa ASK. CMA has in the past hosted a number of seminars including one for State Corporations. Also, in May 2007, the market regulator begun supplement releases to educate the public on the capital markets.

==Criticism==
* Ntalami, a former stockbroker, and Jimnah Mbaru (current NSE chairman and stockbroker), have been criticised in the past of being inappropriate to self-regulate the [[capital markets]] because their affiliations to capital markets could create potential conflicts of interest. The NSE (and its top management) have in the past come under fire for being an 'exclusive club' tightly controlled by an eighteen (18) member team of existing [[brokerage firm|market brokers]] and investment banks. In fact, in a recent attempt to debunk this perception, it was reported on 3 August 2007 that the NSE would put up for sale a seat on its executive board at an estimated reserve price of Ksh 300 million (US$4.5million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2285&amp;Itemid=5812 |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151218/http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2285&amp;Itemid=5812 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The coveted seat was clinched on 21 August 2007 by [[Renaissance Capital (Russian company)|Renaissance Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rencap.com/eng/about/news.asp?ID=295 |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227111234/http://www.rencap.com/eng/about/news.asp?ID=295 |archive-date=27 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Corporate bonds: There have been few corporate bonds approved since the beginning of 2006. The domestic bond market is widely viewed as under-developed, an observation made by Ntalami.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=33954 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041609/http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=33954 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A report released in April 2007 by the [[International Monetary Fund]] ranked Kenya's secondary [[bond market]] as being among the best in Africa, coming third only to South Africa and [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref name="bdafrica.com"/&gt; The outstanding value of corporate bonds as at the end of October 2006 rose to Kes. 8.6 billion ($123 million) following the issue of the second [[tranche]] of Shelter Afrique in October.
* Media shy: Unlike his contemporaries such as NSE chairman Jimnah Mbaru, Suntra Investment Bank's [[James Murigu]] and Standard Investment Bank's [[James Wangunyu]], who do not mind the public limelight, Ntalami has by far and large curved out a quiet demeanor. There have been calls for the Chief Executive to be more visible and for the CMA to create a better communications/PR mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgindex.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707221748/http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgindex.asp |archive-date=7 July 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200704020440.html|title=Kenya: Sensational Stories Destructive|date=2 April 2007|accessdate=30 May 2018|website=AllAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting to this, the CMA recently made efforts to bolster its human resource capacity. On 10 July 2007, it moved to recruit new personnel for various departments in financial, public relations, legal, research, IT and compliance. The recruitment is to be done through a human resources placement firm Osano and &amp; Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1872&amp;Itemid=5822 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151414/http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1872&amp;Itemid=5822 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Egmore''' is a neighbourhood of [[Chennai]], [[India]]. Situated on the northern banks of the [[Coovum River]], Egmore is an important residential area as well as a commercial and transportation hub. The [[Egmore Railway Station]] was the main terminus of the [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway]] and later, the [[metre gauge]] section of the [[Southern Railway Zone|Southern division]] of the [[Indian Railways]]. It continues to be an important railway junction. The [[Government Museum, Chennai]] is also situated in Egmore. Other important institutions based in Egmore include the Government Women and Children's Hospital, the Tamil Nadu State Archives and the [[Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department]].  The [[Wesley Church, Egmore]] is the oldest church of the region.

==History==

The earliest references to Egmore occur in the inscriptions of the Chola king [[Kulothunga I]].&lt;ref name="epigraphiaindicav8"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Triplicane Inscription of Dantivarman|first=V.|last=Venkayya|authorlink=V. Venkayya|work=[[Epigraphia Indica]]|volume=8|editor=[[E. Hultzsch]]|year=1905-06|publisher=Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;Under the Chola Empire, Egmore was the headquarters of an administrative division or ''Nadu'' called Elumbur Nadu.&lt;ref name="epigraphiaindicav8" /&gt; An inscription of the Nellore Chola king Vijaya Kanda Gopal dated 2 September 1264 speaks of a village in Elumur-Tudarmuni Nadu in Pulal Kottam. A [[Vijayanagar Empire|Vijayanagar]] period inscription of Sriranganatha Yadavaraya records an endowment to a monastery in [[Thiruvottriyur]] by a resident of Serruppedu (identified with the present day [[Chetpet (Chennai)|Chetpet]]) in Elumur-Tudarmuni Nadu.  

Egmore is the Anglicised form of "Ezhumbur", the name of a pre-British era village situated on the northern banks of the River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chennaicorporation.com/aboutcoc/che_history10.htm ChennaiCorporation.com: The Leading Chennai Corporation Site on the Net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite the fact that Egmore had been a part of the East India Company's possessions since 1720, it was not until the "Golden age of British rule" stretching from 1858 to 1947 that Egmore witnessed some real growth. The Egmore Museum was one of the first notable monuments to be constructed here. The construction of this famous landmark was undertaken immediately after the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. The Connemara Library was created as an annex housing the Museum's vast book collection and became operational in 1896.

Egmore, in 1796, was the site of the Military Male Orphan Asylum near Madras. This asylum was headed by [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]], who invented the [[Bell-Lancaster method|Madras System]] for schooling there.

===State assembly politics===
{{main|Egmore (State Assembly Constituency)}}
Egmore has been a stronghold for [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK), ever since the party's creation. Other than barely losing to Congress in [[Madras legislative assembly election, 1962|1962 election]], it has consistently voted for DMK, even during times of low popularity for the DMK. However it is worth noting, that recently the [[Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (ADMK), have made significant in-grounds, like they have in many localities around [[Chennai]], which used to be DMK strongholds. Egmore is also 1 of the two total constituents won by DMK in [[Tamil Nadu state assembly election, 1991|1991 election]]. This constituent is reserved for [[scheduled caste]].  This is also the first MLA seat held by [[K Anbazhagan]], when he won it in [[Madras legislative assembly election, 1957|1957 election]].
* Note: In 1989, ADMK was split between [[Janaki Ramachandran|Janaki faction]] and [[J Jayalalithaa|Jayalalithaa faction]], and only the Jayalalithaa faction is reported in the ADMK column since they were the highest vote getter from the divided faction. The Janaki faction got 4,293, which is about 5.6% of the voters.

===Lok Sabha politics===
Egmore assembly constituency is part of [[Chennai Central (Lok Sabha constituency)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Transport==
[[Image:Egmorestation1926.jpg|thumb|Madras Egmore railway station in 1926]]
Egmore Railway Station is the second most important in the state of Tamil Nadu after the Chennai Central Railway Station. It was constructed in 1908 and functioned as the headquarters of the now defunct [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway]] till 1951.

Egmore is well connected to other parts of the city. Many of the state-run Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses run through Egmore. Egmore has its own suburban train station on the Chennai Beach - Tambaram railway line, which connects it to other parts of the city.

'''Elio Fiorucci'''  (10 June 1935 – 19 July 2015) was an Italian fashion designer and the founder of the [[Fiorucci]] fashion label.

Beginning in retailing at the age of 14, he later created a fashion brand that had worldwide success during the 1970s and 1980s, including becoming a key label of the [[disco]]-scene. The retail environments he created were destinations, rather than simply places to buy clothes; his New York store was known by some as the daytime [[Studio 54]] and gave space to artists and creatives – including [[Andy Warhol]].

Fiorucci is credited with designing and popularising stretch jeans, and for transforming the fashion scene. [[Giorgio Armani]] described him as a revolutionary, adding: "He was always ready to take some risks to really understand his time".&lt;ref name="WWD Turra"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turra|first1=Alessandra|title=Italian Fashion World Mourns Elio Fiorucci|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/elio-fiorucci-dead-at-10189772/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=WWD|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Elio Fiorucci was born in [[Milan]] and was one of six children, two of them boys.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family escaped to the countryside during the [[world War II|war]], returning afterwards to continue running the family shoe shop and manufacturing business.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiorucci started working in his father's shop when he was 14, becoming a full-time worker there at 17.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Fiorucci created his first successful design – a brightly coloured waterproof overshoe. The design was featured in the Italian magazine ''[[Amica (magazine)|Amica]]'' and earned him enough money to go travelling. His travels included a visit to London, then [[Swinging London|a hotbed of young fashion]], and he was said to have been surprised and also influenced by the dynamic retailing approaches found in [[Carnaby Street]] and [[Kensington Market, London|Kensington Market]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he would say: "That creative chaos represented a new deal, free from the pressures of formal dressing and elegance".&lt;ref name="FT Sanderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Rachel|title=Elio Fiorucci, designer and retailer, 1935-2015|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6277046-3214-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html#axzz3iu44iKaU|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch of retail brand==
After returning to Milan, he opened his first shop in 1967.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giovanni Orso|title=VISTI DA VICINO: Elio Fiorucci|url=http://www.ecodibiella.it/it/web/visti-da-vicino-br-elio-fiorucci-6103/sez/territorio|date=5 March 2012|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=[[L'Eco di Bergamo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was located in the Galleria Passarella and targeted a much younger clientele than was typical for Italian retailing of the time. Fiorucci stocked London designers such as [[Ossie Clark]], as well as the typical [[hippie]] uniform of [[Afghan Coat|Afghan coat]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The store became an eclectic mix of eccentricities – everything from rag rugs and kettles to hair products and clothing.&lt;ref name="WWD Turra"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turra|first1=Alessandra|title=Italian Fashion World Mourns Elio Fiorucci|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/elio-fiorucci-dead-at-10189772/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=WWD|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exotic market-style approach he'd seen in Kensington Market was added to, with Fiorucci using the fashion inspiration he'd gained in his travels to places such as [[Mexico]] and [[Ibiza]], as well as being inspired by the London scene.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Plucinska"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plucinska|first1=Joanna|title=The King of Stretch Jeans, Elio Fiorucci, Has Passed Away|url=http://time.com/3965345/elio-fiorucci-stretch-jeans-obituary/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Time|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He created his own label in 1970.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giovanni Orso|title=VISTI DA VICINO: Elio Fiorucci|url=http://www.ecodibiella.it/it/web/visti-da-vicino-br-elio-fiorucci-6103/sez/territorio|date=5 March 2012|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=[[L'Eco di Bergamo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was considerably older than his target market – the teenage and young shopper – he employed young fashion scouts internationally to report back on what young people were wearing and discover different products and designs that could be incorporated into his manufacturing. The distinctive logo he chose for Fiorucci was two less than saintly looking Victorian cherubs in sunglasses.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clothing he manufactured was affordable and often kitsch – such as bright coloured T-shirts featuring his trademark cherub motif or [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters.&lt;ref name="FT Sanderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Rachel|title=Elio Fiorucci, designer and retailer, 1935-2015|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6277046-3214-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html#axzz3iu44iKaU|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The store was distinctively different and radical for the time and grew to become what Fiorucci himself would describe as: "an amusement park of novelties". A second store opened in Milan's Via Torino – it included a fast-food restaurant and became a place for young people to see and be seen. By this stage, Fiorucci had financial backing from the Montedison group.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York store==
In 1976, the Fiorucci brand was taken to New York, with a retail store on [[59th Street (Manhattan)|East 59th Street]]. Its interior was part designed by [[Ettore Sottsass]] and it became part of the ascendent disco culture – the opening party was held at Studio 54 and Fiorucci chartered a jumbo jet to fly in his Italian guests.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his Milan stores, this became a place for people to hang out and the store offered free [[espresso]] and music from resident DJs – it became known as the daytime Studio 54 because of the disco crowd that gathered there.&lt;ref name="DT 22072015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elio Fiorucci, fashion designer – obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11756005/Elio-Fiorucci-fashion-designer-obituary.html|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiorucci became friendly with [[Andy Warhol]] and gave him a free office in the store in order to set up ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]''. Warhol described the store as fun, saying: "That's all I ever wanted, all plastic".&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiorucci also offered wall space to artist [[Keith Haring]] and gave [[Concession (contract)|retail concessions]] to designers [[Anna Sui]] and [[Betsey Johnson]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous patrons included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie Onassis]] and [[Cher]], and the teenage [[Marc Jacobs]] also spent time there.&lt;ref name="Time Plucinska"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plucinska|first1=Joanna|title=The King of Stretch Jeans, Elio Fiorucci, Has Passed Away|url=http://time.com/3965345/elio-fiorucci-stretch-jeans-obituary/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Time|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WWD Turra"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turra|first1=Alessandra|title=Italian Fashion World Mourns Elio Fiorucci|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/elio-fiorucci-dead-at-10189772/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=WWD|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion and change of ownership===
The expansion, which had begun in 1975, continued apace. By 1984, the brand had stores on London's [[King's Road]] and LA's [[Rodeo Drive]], as well as branches in Sydney, Tokyo and Hong Kong. Its Milan store would attract up to 10,000 visitors on a Saturday at the peak of its success.&lt;ref name="FT Sanderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Rachel|title=Elio Fiorucci, designer and retailer, 1935-2015|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6277046-3214-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html#axzz3iu44iKaU|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, Elio Fiorucci's reach appeared unstoppable – he said: "we were never wrong" – but he struggled to manage the company's financial affairs.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] bought Montedison's share in the company, selling it on to Aknofin six years later. Also in 1986, the New York store was forced to close, followed by other international outlets and the company went into [[Administration (law)|administration]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fiorucci label was sold to the Carrera jeans label, which sold it on in 1990 to the Japanese firm Edwin International.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giovanni Orso|title=VISTI DA VICINO: Elio Fiorucci|url=http://www.ecodibiella.it/it/web/visti-da-vicino-br-elio-fiorucci-6103/sez/territorio|date=5 March 2012|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=[[L'Eco di Bergamo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La rep"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Redazione|title=Milano, Elio Fiorucci morto in casa per un malore: col suo stile pop rivoluzionò la moda|url=http://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/07/20/news/milano_il_mondo_della_moda_e_in_lutto_elio_fiorucci_trovato_morto_nella_sua_casa-119468707/|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=[[La Repubblica]]|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiorucci retained creative control under Edwin, but the relationship was not smooth.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His original Fiorucci store in Milan closed in 2003.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The New York store closed in the same year, having moved downtown and – in post [[9/11]] New York – become a space that sponsored and supported new artists. [[AndrewAndrew]] used the shop to launch their careers.&lt;ref name="Time Plucinska"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plucinska|first1=Joanna|title=The King of Stretch Jeans, Elio Fiorucci, Has Passed Away|url=http://time.com/3965345/elio-fiorucci-stretch-jeans-obituary/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Time|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later activities===
After the Fiorucci brand, Elio Fiorucci launched a new  fashion label [[Love Therapy]], which included jeans, hoodies, clothes and accessories.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giovanni Orso|title=VISTI DA VICINO: Elio Fiorucci|url=http://www.ecodibiella.it/it/web/visti-da-vicino-br-elio-fiorucci-6103/sez/territorio|date=5 March 2012|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=[[L'Eco di Bergamo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Love Therapy orfana.

==Brand influence and legacy==
It has been said that garments were the least important part of Fiorucci's success. Instead, it was the retail ambience and branding – he was an early adopter of the outrageous advertising campaign and even had the stickers for one [[monokini]] campaign seized by the Italian police.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most significant introductions was in jeans, which he cut close to the body and to fit women's shape. From 1982, his denims incorporated [[lycra]], and he also made jeans in other materials, including [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skintight – almost spray-on – look he created was said to have been inspired by the sight of women in Ibiza in wet jeans; Fiorucci, having noted that they fitted women's bodies better when wet, decided to recreate the effect, and his designs left little to the imagination.&lt;ref name="Time Plucinska"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plucinska|first1=Joanna|title=The King of Stretch Jeans, Elio Fiorucci, Has Passed Away|url=http://time.com/3965345/elio-fiorucci-stretch-jeans-obituary/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Time|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FT Sanderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Rachel|title=Elio Fiorucci, designer and retailer, 1935-2015|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6277046-3214-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html#axzz3iu44iKaU|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He helped to popularise animal prints in 1970s and early '80s fashion – his trademark was leopard-print – although he himself was a vegetarian and never used leather in his jeans or other garments.&lt;ref name="Time Plucinska"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plucinska|first1=Joanna|title=The King of Stretch Jeans, Elio Fiorucci, Has Passed Away|url=http://time.com/3965345/elio-fiorucci-stretch-jeans-obituary/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Time|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 21072015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fiorucci – a life in pictures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/jul/21/fiorucci-a-life-in-pictures|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiorucci's influence on the disco scene was strong; his New York art director also styled the then rising star [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, at the brand's 15th anniversary party in Studio 54, it was Madonna who agreed to jump out of the birthday cake.&lt;ref name="DT 22072015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elio Fiorucci, fashion designer – obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11756005/Elio-Fiorucci-fashion-designer-obituary.html|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FT Sanderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Rachel|title=Elio Fiorucci, designer and retailer, 1935-2015|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6277046-3214-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html#axzz3iu44iKaU|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiorucci's brand had a name check – alongside [[Halston]] and [[Gucci]] – in the [[Bernard Edwards]] and [[Nile Rodgers]] song "He's the Greatest Dancer", a disco anthem sung by [[Sister Sledge]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An obituary on the BBC Radio 4 programme ''[[Last Word]]'' (first broadcast on 18 August 2015) interviewed fashion curator at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] Sonnet Stanfill, who suggested Elio Fiorucci helped to make fashion a lot less formal – transforming jeans into fashion that could be worn day or evening. She added that his design skills encompassed not just fashion but also retail environment and marketing materials, which combined to make the garments more compelling. Graphic designer [[Terry Jones (i-D)|Terry Jones]] suggested that his approach had a direct influence on fashion brands that followed, such as [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] and [[Moschino]].&lt;ref name="BBC R4 Last Word"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stanfill|first1=Sonnet|title=Last Word|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b065061q|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=BBC Radio 4|ref=begins 19.33|date=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the flamboyance of the clothes and retail environments he created, Fiorucci's personal style was restrained – typically sweater and trousers – and he told ''[[Women's Wear Daily|WWD]]'' in 1976, in an interview about the opening of his Manhattan store that he was: "a merchant, not a man of fashion".&lt;ref name="WWD Turra"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turra|first1=Alessandra|title=Italian Fashion World Mourns Elio Fiorucci|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/elio-fiorucci-dead-at-10189772/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=WWD|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married twice and had three daughters.&lt;ref name="FT Sanderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Rachel|title=Elio Fiorucci, designer and retailer, 1935-2015|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6277046-3214-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html#axzz3iu44iKaU|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faultless Pajama Company''', originally E. Rosenfeld and Company and then the Rosenfeld &amp; Steppacher Company, was a [[Baltimore]]-based garment manufacturer that began operation in 1881. The factory was located in [[downtown Baltimore]], on the corner of [[Maryland Route 129|South Paca]] and [[Lombard Street (Baltimore)|Lombard]] Streets, in what is now referred to as the [[Westside, Baltimore|Westside]]. It was one of the Baltimore garment industry's major employers.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Brennan (1998-10-07) "[http://www2.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=3691 Pins and Needles: Once the City's Largest Industry, Baltimore's Rag Trade is Stitched Into a Corner]" ''Baltimore City Paper''. Retrieved 2010-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company mostly manufactured pajamas and nightwear, leading to their slogan, "The Nightwear of a Nation". They were the first manufacturer to use elastic in the waist of pajama pants, rather than drawstrings or belts.

The company was best known at the time for its jingle "My Faultless Pajama Girl". This piece, a fox-trot, was composed by Louis Fisher in 1917. Sheet music was published by Jerome H Remick &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress.

The company was sold to fellow garment manufacturer Wilson Brothers in the 1940s. Wilson Brothers continued to produce pajamas under the Faultless Pajama name in addition to their own Wilson Wear line.&lt;ref&gt;Life Magazine, advertisement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3429">'''''Habitat''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[real estate]] [[magazine]] founded in 1982 and aimed at [[cooperative housing|co-op]] boards, [[condominium]] associations, and related professionals such as [[Lawyer|attorneys]] and managing agents. The print magazine concentrates on the greater [[New York City metropolitan area]] while its [[Web site]] contains features for general-interest co-op/condo directors, residents, and buyers/sellers.

==Publication history==
[[Journalist]] Carol J. Ott founded what was then titled ''N.Y. Habitat'' in New York City in 1982, for a primary audience of co-op and loft owners/renters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://habitatmag.com/publication_info/about_habitat Habitatmag.com: "About ''Habitat''"]&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine had evolved from Ott's 1980-82 newspaper, ''The Loft Letter''.&lt;ref&gt;''Habitat'', May 2007: Influences: Top 25 People, Events, &amp; Organizations: "Co-op and Condo Publications: Filling a Niche Market", by Bill Morris&lt;/ref&gt; Originally bimonthly, in 1997 the publication schedule increased to 11 times yearly, with one double-issue. As of 2016, Ott remains [[publisher]] and [[editor-in-chief]]. The Associate Publisher is Bill Fink and the Operations Manager is Ivis Fundichely.

==Editorial and art==
''Habitat'' publishes both [[Human interest story|human-interest]] feature stories, such as how a co-op board avoided a financial collapse, and how a motivated board put through an [[Natural environment|environmentally]] friendly initiative; service articles, such as those detailing guidelines for hiring a [[property management]] firm, illuminating group decision-making dynamics, studying implementation of  [[solar power|solar]] or [[geothermal power]], and reviewing methods of increasing building revenue; and [[advocacy journalism]], such as stories about shoddy new construction and poor enforcement of [[building code]]s. Shorter pieces provide updates on co-op/condo legislation, judicial decisions, and policy trends.

Art contributors include illustrators [[Danny Hellman]], [[Jane Sanders]], [[Liza Donnelly]], and [[Marcellus Hall]]. Regular contributing writers include Bill Morris, Jennifer V. Hughes, Mathew Hall and [[Frank Lovece]]. As of 2016, the longtime editorial director is [[Tom Soter]], who joined the magazine with its second issue in 1982, and the [[art director]] is [[Chad Townsend]].

An '''integration warehouse''' is a [[data warehouse]] specifically geared to the purpose of integrating information from various sources or systems. Integration warehouses are quite often used in the [[reinsurance]] industry instead of conventional data warehouses.

==History==

The concept of integration warehousing dates back to mid 2000. In the reinsurance industry it became quite obvious that data warehouses didn't cover all the business requirements and therefore IT started to focus more on the integration aspects. This finally led to solutions that now specifically fit the reinsurance business requirements.

==Architecture==

The integration warehouse architecture is quite similar to the data warehouse architecture. The main difference is in the integration aspect and the overall data model which is based on a holistic reinsurance business model.

==Advantages==

It is said that load performance of integration warehouses can be nearly real time, as opposed to data warehouses, which can be slower.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2082">'''James Gray Bethune''' (April 1, 1793 – October 13, 1841) was born in [[Upper Canada]]. He was the son of an Anglican priest, the Reverend [[John Bethune (clergyman)|John Bethune]].

James Gray was from a large family and four of the brothers had notable careers in Canada. [[Alexander Neil Bethune]] became a bishop of the diocese of Toronto. [[John Bethune (principal)|John Bethune]] was the acting principal of McGill University for over ten years. [[Angus Bethune (fur trader)|Angus Bethune]] was prominent in the fur trade and [[Donald Bethune]] was an important political figure in Upper Canada.

James had a career in business which began in 1812 after finishing school and moving to [[Cobourg]], Upper Canada. By 1817 he was involved in a number of enterprises, namely; a store, sawmill, distillery and community postmaster.

Bethune’s enterprises in the community made him well known and often admired personality. He was a [[justice of the peace]] and an officer of the courts making him a trusted person as well. His involvements in the community included a number of organizations and he received the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the militia. He became an agent for  the [[Bank of Upper Canada]] in 1830 and shortly after was promoted to cashier of the Cobourg branch.

The success in the financial area also led to matching misfortunes. His lending policies often ran counter to bank policies and ended in bankruptcy. He subsequently made an unsuccessful foray into politics and had a brief stay in debtors' prison. His reputation was ruined and he moved away to New York state where he died after a protracted illness in [[Rochester, New York]]. Bethune was later buried in [[Cobourg, Ontario]].

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' has described Goodwin as "...one of London's best-connected media dealmakers."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/400e4076-8709-11e1-ad68-00144feab49a|title=Goodwin departs Jefferies to set up bank|last=Edgecliffe-Johnson|first=Andrew|date=15 April 2015|website=Financial Times|publisher=Pearson|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has advised on more than 100 media deals, together worth over $20&amp;nbsp;billion. They include Chris Evans' purchase of [[Virgin Radio]], the sale of [[Friends Reunited]] to [[ITV plc|ITV]], the sale of ''[[Who Wants To Be A Millionaire]]'' and the merger of property websites Findaproperty.com, Primelocation.com and [[Zoopla]].

Goodwin has featured in [[GQ magazine|''GQ Magazine's'']] ''100 Most Connected Men 2014''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/100-most-connected-men-2014|title=GQ and ei's 100 Most Connected Men 2014|newspaper=British GQ|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the 2014 [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired 100'']] list of Europe's top digital influencers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/wired-100|title=The 2014 Wired 100|last=WIRED|newspaper=WIRED UK|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
After graduating from the [[University of Nottingham]], Goodwin worked briefly at [[Coopers and Lybrand]],&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/yourbusiness/9542128/Digital-stars-tackle-elitist-media-and-tech-sectors.html|title=Digital stars tackle 'elitist' media and tech sectors|work=The Daily Telegraph|author=Your Business|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where for one assignment he was asked to compile two reports. One report was to be on a "fascinating" proposed deal in the media sector, the other involved research into car component manufacturers; at that moment Goodwin realised he would "...prefer castration" to car parts: “Every deal I’ve worked on has been in and around the media sector since then,” he told ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/yourbusiness/9542128/Digital-stars-tackle-elitist-media-and-tech-sectors.html|title=Digital stars tackle 'elitist' media and tech sectors|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodwin then spent a year at private equity group [[Apax Partners]], before leaving to join a News Corporation/Liberty Media-backed buyout of [[Talk Radio UK|Talk Radio]] in 1997. He was appointed managing director of Talk Radio, which went on to become the foundation for The Wireless Group PLC, for which Goodwin was Group managing director under [[Kelvin Mackenzie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/talk-radio-announces-management-shake-up/42973#|title=Talk Radio announces management shake-up|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2886011/Media-star-rises-with-legendary-Sun-editor.html|title=Media star rises with legendary Sun editor|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Goodwin and Julian Culhane co-founded LongAcre Partners, a corporate finance boutique. LongAcre worked with [[Elisabeth Murdoch (businesswoman)|Elisabeth&amp;nbsp;Murdoch]], helping to build her TV production business [[Shine TV (UK)|Shine]] via a series of acquisitions. LongAcre was also involved in the £175m sale of&amp;nbsp;[[Friends Reunited]] to ITV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://perspectives.pictet.com/2013/09/12/the-digital-media-investor-and-entrepreneur/|title=The digital media investor and entrepreneur – Perspectives Pictet|last=Pictet|website=perspectives.pictet.com|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; LongAcre's investors included the law firm [[Olswang]] and private equity house Corsair. In 2007 LongAcre was sold to US investment bank [[Jefferies Group|Jefferies]]. Goodwin remained at Jeffries as Head of Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications until 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Lepe Partners ==
In 2011 Goodwin and Culhane co-founded Lepe Partners a merchant bank focused on the media internet and technology sectors. The company was named after [[Lepe, Hampshire|a hamlet and beach in Hampshire]] where Goodwin spends his weekends.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In addition to its advisory work, Lepe operates a venture growth fund which provides capital and strategic support to late stage venture growth opportunities in industry verticals.  The fund is structured as a pledge fund based on annual commitments, with deals sourced through Lepe's business contacts.Lepe's portfolio includes: Pharmacy2U, Boat International Media, CreativeLive, Masabi, and Festicket. The fund successfully exited its investment in Wahanda (now Treatwell) in 2015, following a sale of the business to Recruit Holding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masabi.com/2015/12/07/10839/|title=Mobile Ticketing Leader Masabi Secures $12m Growth Funding From Keolis, Lepe Partners, MasterCard, and MMC Ventures|last=Gooch|first=James|date=7 December 2015|website=Masabi|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iq-mag.net/2016/07/festival-package-site-festicket-raises-6-3-million/|title=Festival package site Festicket raises $6.3m {{!}} IQ Magazine|date=1 July 2016|newspaper=IQ Magazine|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/400e4076-8709-11e1-ad68-00144feab49a?sectionid=stream/peopleId/TnN0ZWluX1BOXzIwMDkwNjIzXzE3NjM=-UE4=|title=Goodwin departs Jefferies to set up bank|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lepe has advised on investment deals for [[News Corp]], [[Ministry of Sound]] and [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2016-08-11/sale-of-ministry-of-sound-label-music-to-lepe-partners-ears|title=Ministry of Sound sale music to dealmaker's ears|last=Burke|first=Lucy Burton and Tim|date=11 August 2016|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/30/rupert-murdochs-news-corp-buys-talksport-owner-in-220m-deal|title=Rupert Murdoch's News Corp buys TalkSport owner in £220m deal|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=30 June 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founders Forum ==

In 2006 Goodwin and Hoberman created Founders Forum, an invitation-only network for digital entrepreneurs, corporate CEOs and senior investors. The Forum has 1500 members and has become known as a Europe-based equivalent of [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles|Sun Valley]], the Allen &amp; Co retreat for media executives in the US. Speakers and attendees at previous Forum meetings include [[Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson]], [[Arianna Huffington]], [[Eric Schmidt]], [[Reid Hoffman]], [[Sean Parker]],&amp;nbsp;[[Niklas Zennström|Niklas Zennstrom]], [[Mikitani Hiroshi|Mikitani]] [[Mikitani Hiroshi|Hiroshi]], [[Ben Horowitz]], [[Natalie Massenet]], [[Charles Dunstone]], [[Tony Fadell]], [[Natalia Vodianova|Natalie Vodianova]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Peter Gabriel|Peter Gabrie]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l, [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Daniel Ek]] and [[Ari Emanuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/london-the-new-silicon-valley-8890601.html|title=London: the new Silicon Valley?|date=19 October 2013|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/lucian-grainge-banging-the-drum-for-the-uk-in-la-8488078.html|title=Lucian Grainge: Banging the drum for the UK in LA|date=8 February 2013|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Events are currently held in London, Paris, [[Madrid]], [[Istanbul]], Los Angeles, New York City, Rio de Janeiro, [[Mumbai]], New Delhi, [[Qingdao]] and Singapore.  In 2013 the ''Financial Times'' announced a media partnership with the Forum, presenting two awards at that year's London event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.inpublishing.co.uk/news/articles/ft_partners_with_founders_forum.aspx|title=FT partners with Founders Forum|last=InPublishing|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, Founders Forum and the [[British government departments|British Government's]] [[UK Trade &amp; Investment]] arm created the Technology Innovators' Forum (TIF-IN), which connects new UK businesses with influential heads of content, media and finance companies worldwide.

In 2009 Goodwin, Hoberman and other partners co-founded PROfounders Capital, an early stage fund backed by entrepreneurs for digital entrepreneurs. One of its first investments was UK-based [[TweetDeck]], the online application sold two years later to Twitter for $40m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8f68fed2-8704-11e0-92df-00144feabdc0|title=Twitter acquires UK's TweetDeck for $40m|website=Financial Times|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founders Forum has launched a number of initiatives under the Founders aegis, including the executive search arm Founders Keepers and the strategic consultancy Founders Intelligence.

== Philanthropy ==
=== Founders Pledge ===
In June 2015 Goodwin co-launched [[Founders Pledge]], a UK- and US-registered charity to enable tech entrepreneurs to commit to donating at least 2% of their personal proceeds to philanthropic causes upon exit.&lt;sup&gt;[[Founders Pledge#cite note-80000-hours-interview-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Founders Pledge's declared mission is to "...strip down the barriers to charitable giving, making it easy for technology entrepreneurs to give back to society." The Pledge's service is paid for by sponsors, partners, and private donors, and is offered free to entrepreneurs. Founders Pledge also offers post-exit support, including charity sourcing, due diligence and impact reporting. 

At launch, £18.5m was pledged by leaders of 50 UK technology companies, including&amp;nbsp;Alex Depledge of [[Hassle.com]], José Neves of&amp;nbsp;Farfetch, Ben Medlock from&amp;nbsp;[[SwiftKey]]&amp;nbsp;and James Alexander of&amp;nbsp;Zopa. Founder's Pledge has facilitated the giving of $15.5&amp;nbsp;million to charities of donors' choices and has secured a further $180&amp;nbsp;million in legally binding pledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://startups.co.uk/entrepreneurs-encouraged-to-pledge-2-of-proceeds-following-business-exit/|title=Entrepreneurs encouraged to pledge 2% of proceeds to charity following an exit – Startups.co.uk: Starting a business advice and business ideas|date=2 March 2016|access-date=9 November 2016|newspaper=Startups.co.uk: Starting a business advice and business ideas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.varsity.co.uk/news/11019|title=David Goldberg: ‘Find the thing that gets you out of bed in the morning’|access-date=9 November 2016|newspaper=Varsity Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; 

In March 2016 Founders Pledge launched Founders of the Future, a philanthropic initiative that uses artificial intelligence and recommendations to uncover entrepreneurial talent in the 15–35 age group who are not currently founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/london-tech-entrepreneur-matt-miller-10-downing-street-shorts-founders-of-the-future-ed-vaizey-2016-3|title=A high-flying London tech entrepreneur rocked up to No. 10 in shorts and Ed Vaizey loved it|access-date=9 November 2016|newspaper=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp; 

Founders Pledge has also entered partnerships with US seed accelerators [[MassChallenge]] and [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]], to obtain pledges from their funded companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/y-combinator-signs-up-to-founders-pledge-charity-scheme-for-social-causes/|title=Y Combinator signs up to Founders Pledge charity scheme for social causes|last=Butcher|first=Mike|website=TechCrunch|access-date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/masschallenge-blog/masschallenge-partners-with-founders-pledge-to-help-entrepreneurs-pay-it-forward-4f901862b5a7|title=MassChallenge Partners with Founders Pledge to Help Entrepreneurs Pay It Forward – MassChallenge Blog|last=UK|first=MassChallenge|date=3 March 2016|website=Medium|access-date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

=== Founders Forum Foundation ===
Goodwin joined with Hoberman and lastminute.com co-founder [[Martha Lane Fox]] to develop the Founders Forum Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mandrakelondon.com/past-mandrake-events/|title=The Mandrake – Past Events|newspaper=The Mandrake|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation facilitates internships and scholarships to school-leavers from across the UK, to break down the barriers that Goodwin believes result in the majority of media and tech company leaders coming from privileged backgrounds. Goodwin also believes entrepreneurship can address the problems faced by young people, especially "NEETs" ("not in employment, education or training").

Goodwin is disparaging of large tech firms for not doing enough to engage with the UK communities in which they operate, and for failing to paying enough tax: “We should be leaning on them harder to put more back into the country,” he told ''The Telegraph'' newspaper. “I’m not talking about complicated tax structures – we need to [encourage them] to put more back into the cities they're a part of. We're sometimes so afraid of our own shadow that they'll go somewhere else, but where are they going to go? If you want a [European] headquarters, London is the best place to be."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Founders Forum for Good ===
In 2012 Founders Forum announced the launch of Founders Forum For Good. Led by [[Martha Lane Fox|Martha Lane-Fox]] and with Board members including Goodwin, [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Michael Richard Lynch|Mike Lynch]], Founders Forum for Good's mission is to bring together digital entrepreneurs with the leaders of social and environmental organisations to tackle social issues and inequalities. In June 2013 the following year the Forum partnered with [[Nominet UK|Nominet Trust]] to launch Social Tech, Social Change, a £1m fund providing early-stage finance for social entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/10612234/Why-business-should-do-more-to-benefit-society.html|title=Why business should do more to benefit society|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Goodwin is married to Flora Hesketh, the daughter of [[Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh]], the former Conservative Party treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/jonnie-goodwin-the-entrepreneur-taking-our-top-tech-stars-to-tinseltown-8476921.html|title=Jonnie Goodwin: the entrepreneur taking our top tech stars to|author=|date=|website=standard.co.uk|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodwin's hobbies include sailing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yachtingworld.com/performance-world/news/532463/aam-cowes-week-day-seven|title=Aberdeen Asset Management Cowes Week day seven &amp;#124; Racing news from|date=17 August 2012|publisher=Yachting World|author=Louay Habib|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he campaigned the J/109 ''Harlequin'', becoming the overall winner at [[Cowes Week]] 2012 for both the White Group, J/109 group, and Cowes Week overall.

== Criticism of Davis Cup ==
Kosmos partnership with the International Tennis Federation to revamp the Davis Cup has been criticized by the tennis community. Many claim that the partnership will take away from the traditions of the 118-year-old tennis event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/22595981/davis-cup-revamp-plans-hold-event-one-location-seven-days-november-get-mixed-response|title=Davis Cup revamp plans get mixed response|website=Espn.com|access-date=2018-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523172112/http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/22595981/davis-cup-revamp-plans-hold-event-one-location-seven-days-november-get-mixed-response|archive-date=2018-05-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a secret meeting held in Orlando, Florida, on August 16, 2018, the changes proposed by Kosmos received a 71 percent approval at the International Tennis Federation annual general meeting. Proposals require a two-thirds majority to pass.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/sports/davis-cup-vote-itf.html|title=Davis Cup Overhaul Wins Approval From Tennis Officials|website=Nytimes.com|access-date=2018-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817181723/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/sports/davis-cup-vote-itf.html|archive-date=2018-08-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While France and USA voice strong support for the changes and voted in favor of the move, others, such as Australia, were against the new format.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.co.za/Tennis/itf-delegates-approve-radical-davis-cup-overhaul-20180816|title=ITF delegates approve radical Davis Cup overhaul|website=Sport24.co.za|access-date=2018-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817113120/https://www.sport24.co.za/Tennis/itf-delegates-approve-radical-davis-cup-overhaul-20180816|archive-date=2018-08-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/43202373|title=Davis Cup: ITF plans to introduce 18-team World Cup of Tennis Finals in revamp|date=26 February 2018|website=Bbc.com|access-date=2018-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113225108/https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/43202373|archive-date=2018-11-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Excessive citations inline |date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5889">'''Mattias Kristoffer Therman''' (born 10 April 1974) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] businessman and rally driver. He was an owner of [[Hartwall]] beverage company and in 2008 he earned more capital gains (over 28 million €) than anyone else in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv3.fi/urheilu/ralli/uutiset.shtml/arkistot/ralli/2010/02/1054434 |title= Kimin kanssa kolaroinut on suomalaismiljönääri|date=11 February 2010 |publisher=[[MTV3]] |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rally career==
[[File:Rally Finland 2010 - EK 1 - Mattias Therman.jpg|thumb|right|Therman driving at 2010 Rally Finland]]
Therman's rallying career began as a [[co-driver]] in 2007. In 2008 he began driving in his first events in his native Finland, and competed in [[Wales Rally GB]] at the end of the year, finishing 25th overall. In 2009 he established Team Therminator, and competed on [[Rally Finland]], entered under the [[Munchi's Ford World Rally Team]] banner in a [[Ford Focus RS WRC 08]], finishing 15th overall.

In December 2009 it was announced that [[Marcus Grönholm]] would return to the [[World Rally Championship]] on the [[2010 Rally Sweden]] driving a Focus WRC for Team Therminator alongside Therman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motorstv.com/car/rally/wrc/11122009/wrc-gronholm-contest-rally-sweden |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305022427/http://www.motorstv.com/car/rally/wrc/11122009/wrc-gronholm-contest-rally-sweden |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearer the event the pair were brought under the [[Stobart Ford World Rally Team]] banner, with Gronholm registered to score manufacturer points for the squad. Gronholm and Therman finished 21st and 24th respectively. For [[2010 Rally Finland|Rally Finland]] [[Juha Kankkunen]] will join Therman racing under the Stobart banner.

{{For|a related concept in software|Capability Maturity Model}}
A '''mature technology''' is a technology that has been in use for long enough that most of its initial [[Fault (technology)|fault]]s and inherent problems have been removed or reduced by further development. In some contexts, it may also refer to technology that has not seen widespread use, but whose scientific background is well understood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/rbaef/documents/mature.pdf Defining mature technology (in the sustainability and security of energy supply and utilization)] (from a [[RBAEF]] memo, [[Dartmouth College]], Tuesday 4 December 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the key indicators of a mature technology is the [[ease of use]] for both non-[[expert]]s and professionals. Another indicator is a reduction in the rate of new breakthrough advances related to it—whereas [[invention]]s related to a (popular) immature technology are usually rapid and diverse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/23/52/2956490.pdf How technologies evolve] (from an [[OECD]] and [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] information paper, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and may change the whole use [[paradigm]]—advances to a mature technology are usually [[wikt:incremental|incremental]] improvements only.

==Examples==
{{Citations missing|section|date=August 2016}}

===Mature technologies===
*[[Farming]], most advances are in slight improvements of breeds or in pest reduction.
*[[Motor vehicle]], widely used by non-experts, the general principles have not changed for decades.
*[[Telephone]], though considered mature, [[mobile phones]] showed a rare potential for substantial changes even in such technologies.
*[[Firearm]], typified by [[assault rifle]] technology, most advances are slight improvements as manufacturers alter balances between weight, size, firepower, range, and accuracy.
*[[Watch]], most ordinary watch movements have the same or very similar components.  Most advances are with the aesthetic looks or sub-dials on the watch face.
*[[Bicycle]], another mature form of transport.
*Schooling (approximately grades 7 to 16), is characterized by courses of a semester or year in duration, that meet on the order of three hours per week, with a structure of one instructor to many students.

===Technologies not yet fully mature===
*[[Internet]], with still partly conflicting technological and human standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.registrysolutions.co.uk/sdmxDemo/notes/SDMXSiteWebServices.htm{{Dead link|date=April 2013}} The Status and Importance of Web Services]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (from the registrysolutions.co.uk website)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Computers]] (becoming more mature due to advances in user-friendly [[operating systems]] and the decline of [[Moore's Law]]).
*[[Model (economics)|Economic models]] (still showing high [[failure rate]]s in economic prediction).
*[[Distributed ledger]] technology is currently used in a limited number of applications mainly being [[blockchain]]s, though ongoing research and potential use cases are currently being explored.

===Immature technologies===
*[[Nanotechnology]], actual industrial applications limited so far.
*[[Biotechnology]], which still doesn't solve most health and ecologic human challenges.
*[[Quantum computer]]s, so far mostly a theoretical concept.
*[[Nuclear fusion power]], mainly theoretical due to the containment energy expenditure thus far outweighs yielded energy in practice.
*[[Virtual reality]], whilst practical systems exist, the potential roadmap is estimated to require a lifetime of advances in many fields.

'''Michael "Mikha" Reisser''' ({{Lang-he|מיכאל רייסר}}, 26 April 1946 &amp;ndash; 27 October 1988) was an [[Israel]]i politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Likud]] between 1981 and his death in 1988.

==Biography==
Born in [[Tel Aviv]] towards the end of the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate era]], Reisser was educated at the Shalva [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], before studying sociology and labour studies at [[Tel Aviv University]]. He became chairman of the university's student union in 1970, and from 1971 until 1977 chaired the secretariat of the [[Herut]] young guard.

In 1978 he started working as a consultant to the [[Immigrant Absorption Minister of Israel|Minister of Immigrant Absorption]] and [[Housing and Construction Minister of Israel|Minister of Housing]]. He went on to become deputy director of the Housing Ministry and director of the Israel Builders Association from 1979 until 1981. He also became chairman of the board at HaYekev in 1981, and was a member of the board at the Ata textiles company from 1981 until 1984.

From 1979 until 1980 he chaired Herut's Organisation Department. The following year he was [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|elected]] to the Knesset on the Likud list (then an alliance of Herut and other right-wing parties). He was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984]], and became chairman of the House Committee. However, on 26 October 1988, he was fatally injured in a car crash whilst on a journey to [[Jerusalem]] for a photoshoot for the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|upcoming elections]] when his car crashed into another car being driven by future politician [[Dalia Itzik]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART/863/595.html Itzik power] NRG, 4 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and died of his injuries the following day. His Knesset seat was taken by [[David Mor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mkindexbyknesset_eng.asp?knesset=11 Knesset Members in the Eleventh Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisser was married with a son and twin daughters. All three of his children became religious after his death. 

[[Beitar Avraham Be'er Sheva F.C.|Beitar Avraham Be'er Sheva's]] stadium, a junior high school and winery club in [[Rishon LeZion]], streets in [[Lod]] and [[Ramla]], and a playground in [[Nahariya]] are named after him.

[[File:Nuclear Energy Institute logo.svg|thumb|Nuclear Energy Institute logo]]
[[Image:NEI logo.gif|thumb|right|200px|Previous logo of the Nuclear Energy Institute.]]
The '''Nuclear Energy Institute''' ('''NEI''') is a [[nuclear industry]] trade association in the United States of America, based in [[Washington, D.C.]]

== Synopsis ==
According to its website, the NEI "develops policy on key legislative and regulatory issues affecting the industry. NEI then serves as a unified industry voice before the U.S. Congress, executive branch agencies and federal regulators, as well as international organizations and venues. NEI also provides a forum to resolve technical and business issues for the industry. Finally, NEI provides accurate and timely information on the nuclear industry to members, policymakers, the news media and the public." In practice, this takes the form of representing the nuclear industry's interests before Congress and the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], as well as serving as an industry think tank in order to influence public policy.

The nuclear energy industry that NEI represents and serves includes: Commercial electricity generation, nuclear medicine including diagnostics and therapy, food processing and agricultural applications, industrial and manufacturing applications, uranium mining and processing, nuclear fuel and radioactive materials manufacturing, transportation of radioactive materials, and nuclear waste management

NEI is governed by a 47-member board of directors. The board includes representatives from the nation's 27 nuclear utilities, plant designers, architect/engineering firms and fuel cycle companies. Eighteen members of the board serve on the executive committee, which is responsible for NEI's business and policy affairs.

== History ==
NEI was founded in 1994&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nei.org/aboutnei/ Nuclear Energy Institute - About NEI&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; from the merger of several nuclear energy industry organizations, the oldest of which was created in 1953. Specifically, in 1994, NEI was formed from the merger of the Nuclear Utility Management and Resources Council (NUMARC), which addressed generic regulatory and technical issues; the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness (USCEA), which conducted a national communications program; the American Nuclear Energy Council (ANEC), which conducted government affairs; and the nuclear division of the [[Edison Electric Institute]] (EEI), which handled issues involving used nuclear fuel management, nuclear fuel supply, and the economics of nuclear energy. In 1987, NUMARC and USCEA were created through a division of the [[Atomic Industrial Forum]] (AIF). USCEA was founded in 1979 as the U.S. Committee for Energy Awareness. AIF was created in 1953 to focus on the beneficial uses of nuclear energy. This was two years before the international “Atoms for Peace” conference held in Geneva in 1955, marking the dawn of the nuclear age.

==Current issues==
In addition to its core mission, NEI also sponsors a number of public communications efforts to build support for the industry and the expansion of nuclear energy, a number of which have come under attack from environmentalists and anti-nuclear activists. In 2006, NEI founded the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition (CASEnergy) to help build local support around the country for new nuclear construction. The co-chairs of the coalition are [[Greenpeace]] co-founder [[Patrick Moore (environmentalist)|Patrick Moore]] and former [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] Secretary and New Jersey Governor [[Christine Todd Whitman]]. As of April 2006, CASEnergy boasted 427 organizations and 454 individuals as members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=The Campaign to Sell Nuclear |author=Diane Farseta  |date=September 1, 2008 |volume=64 |issue=4   |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages=38–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2004, the Austin Chronicle reported that NEI has hired the Potomac Communications Group to ghostwrite pro-nuclear op-ed columns to be submitted to local newspapers under the name of local residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A206880 The Austin Chronicle: News: Will Shill for Nukes: Decommissioning the nuclear lobby's phony op-ed campaign&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 story in the Columbus Dispatch,&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.dispatch.com/newsarchive/ArchiveDisplay.asp?DBLIST=cd03&amp;DOCNUM=35972&amp;TERMV=31027:7:36092:7:71998:9:77277:7:77284:6:77290:9:128646:7:128653:6:128659:9:154327:7:164766:7:1&amp;md=dir The Columbus Dispatch - Local/State&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; NEI said that it engaged a public affairs agency to identify individuals with technical expertise in the nuclear energy industry to participate in the public debate. However, as many of these individuals have little experience in opinion writing for a non-technical audience, the agency provides assistance if requested, a common industry practice.

In 1999, [[Public Citizen]] filed a complaint with the [[Federal Trade Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/release.cfm?ID=412 Public Citizen | Press Room - Public Citizen Asks FTC to Declare NEI Ads False, Misleading&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; charging that an NEI advertising campaign overstated the environmental benefits of nuclear energy to consumers living in markets where sales of electricity had been deregulated. In a ruling the following December, the FTC rejected those claims concluding: NEI did not violate the law; agreed that the advertisements were directed to policymakers and opinion leaders in forums that principally reach those who set national policy on energy and environmental issues, and therefore did not constitute "commercial speech"; noted that in different circumstances, such as direct marketing of electricity, such advertising could be considered commercial speech and be subject to stricter substantiation.

NEI ran other ads with similar content, most recently one released in September 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4280491657378693263&amp;q=nuclear+energy+institute%2C+advertisement Nuclear: Clear Air Energy Advertising&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; touting nuclear energy's non-emitting character and the role it can play in reducing American dependence on foreign sources of [[fossil fuel]]s like oil and natural gas.

In 2008, [[Greenpeace]] criticised NEI's public relations efforts and suggested that NEI's advertising about nuclear power was an example of [[greenwash]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stopgreenwash.org/casestudy_nei The Nuclear Energy Institute: Greenwashing Nuclear Power]&lt;/ref&gt; In the first quarter of 2008, NEI spent $320,000 on lobbying the US federal government. Besides [[United States Congress|Congress]], the nuclear group lobbied the [[White House]], [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy and others in the first three months of the year. The NEI spent $1.3 million to lobby the federal government in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.moneycentral.msn.com/provider/providerarticle.aspx?feed=AP&amp;date=20080530&amp;id=8710380&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, NEI quoted Kathyrn Higley, professor of radiation health physics in the department of nuclear engineering at Oregon State University, who described the health impact of the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident]] to be "really, really minor", adding that "the Japanese government was able to effectively block a large component of exposure in this population".&lt;ref&gt;http://safetyfirst.nei.org/public-health/experts-say-health-effects-of-fukushima-accident-should-be-very-minor/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3448">'''Pablo Carlos Reimers Morales''' (b. July 13, 1946 - d. January 29, 2014) was an entrepreneur from the state of [[Zacatecas]], Mexico. 

He was born July 13, 1946 and raised in Zacatecas until 1961, when he left the state to attend high school at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] in Monterrey in 1961. He continued at the school for university, graduating in 1970 with a degree in business administration, with the aim of returning to his home state to be an entrepreneur. He chose to study at the Tec because of its educational model and the respect held in Zacatecas for the industry in Monterrey. One of his aims in high school was to meet the Tec founder [[Eugenio Garza Sada]] which he was able to do.&lt;ref name=trascender&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.itesm.edu/wps/wcm/connect/snc/portal+informativo/por+tema/educacion/70anostecdemonterrey113_24jul13 |title= Pablo Reimers: trascender a través del compromiso social es su prioridad |date=July 24, 2013 |publisher=Tec de Monterrey |accessdate=July 27, 2013 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fallece&gt; {{cite web |title=Fallece Pablo Reimers |publisher=Zacatecas en Imagen |location=Zacatecas |date=January 29, 2014 |url=http://www.imagenzac.com.mx/nota/fallece-npablo-reimers-n-23-30-06-zl |accessdate=February 3, 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In the very early 1980s, Guillermo Jones Pereda, Juan De Santiago Ortega and Reimers founded Cerámica Santo Niño, today known as Cesantoni. The business began by making ceramic tiles but has since branched out into other ceramic products. The traditional means of making tile in Mexico requires two firings, but he decided to work to find a way to create the product in one firing, succeeding by the end of the 1980s. In 1998, the company worked to automate the process as much as possible, which included replacing many of the existing facilities. Much of the work is now done by robots. The plant works 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is an important source of employment in the state, not only in the plants but also through its demand for raw materials from mines in the state of Zacatecas.&lt;ref name=elmundo&gt; {{cite news |url= http://ntrzacatecas.com/2009/04/19/el-mundo-cesantoni/|title= El mundo Cesantoni |date=April 19, 2009 |publisher=NTR Noticias |location=Zacatecas |accessdate=July 27, 2013 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

He has been quoted as saying that making more money is not the purpose of life, but rather go beyond what already exists. In 1985, Reimers was approached by his alma mater to organize and find resources to found a campus of Tec de Monterrey in Zacatecas. A short time later, he became an advisor to the new institution. Today, he is also the president of the Consejo de Enseñanza e Investigación Superior in Zacatecas.&lt;ref name=trascender/&gt;

Reimers was married to Gabriela Campos de Reimers and has three sons, Pablo Yaco Reimers Campos, Bernardo Reimers Campos and Hermann Reimers Campos, who work in the company.&lt;ref name=formalizan&gt; {{cite news |url= http://www.elporvenir.com.mx/notas.asp?nota_id=434705|title= Formalizan su amor Adriana y Bernardo   |date=October 3, 2010 |publisher=El Porvenir |location=Mexico City |accessdate=July 27, 2013 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elmundo/&gt;

Mr. Reimers died in Zacatecas on January 29th 2014.&lt;ref name=fallece/&gt;

==Early life and career: 1943–1970==
Peter Carey was born in [[Bacchus Marsh]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], in 1943. His parents ran a [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] dealership, Carey Motors. He attended Bacchus Marsh State School from 1948 to 1953, then boarded at [[Geelong Grammar School]] between 1954 and 1960. In 1961, Carey enrolled in a science degree at the new [[Monash University]] in Melbourne, majoring in chemistry and zoology, but cut his studies short because of a car accident and a lack of interest. It was at university that he met his first wife, Leigh Weetman, who was studying German and philosophy, and who also dropped out.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ellen Snodgrass, ''Peter Carey: A Literary Companion'' (Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2010), pp. 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, he began to work in advertising. He was employed by various Melbourne agencies between 1962 and 1967, including on campaigns for [[Volkswagen]] and [[Lindemans (wine)|Lindeman's Wine]].&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; His advertising work brought him into contact with older writers who introduced him to recent European and American fiction: "I didn't really start getting an education until I worked in advertising with people like Barry Oakley and [[Morris Lurie]]—and [[Bruce Petty]] had an office next door."&lt;ref&gt;Candida Baker, ''Yacker: Australian Writers Talk about Their Work'' (Sydney: Picador, 1986), pp. 54-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, he read widely, particularly the works of [[Samuel Beckett]], [[William Faulkner]], [[James Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka]], and [[Gabriel García Márquez]], and began writing on his own, receiving his first rejection slip in 1964, the same year he married Weetman.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, pp. 9-10.

None of them were published. Sun Books accepted ''The Futility Machine'' but did not proceed with publication, and ''Adventures on Board the Marie Celeste'' was accepted by Outback Press before being withdrawn by Carey himself.&lt;ref&gt;Carey Papers, Fryer Library, University of Queensland, [https://archive.is/20120711102735/http://findaid.library.uwa.edu.au/dynaweb/findaid/carey1/@Generic__BookTextView/292;cs=default;ts=default;pt=851 Series A: Novels], A.1: Unpublished Novels.

''Fabulating Beauty: Perspectives on the Fiction of Peter Carey'' (Amsterdam and New York: Rodopi, 2005). Retrieved 30 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey's only publications during the 1960s were "Contacts" (a short extract from the unpublished novel of the same name, in ''Under Twenty-Five: An Anthology'', 1966) and "She Wakes" (a short story, in ''Australian Letters'', 1967). Towards the end of the decade, Carey and Weetman abandoned Australia with "a certain degree of self-hatred",&lt;ref&gt;Sonia Harford, ''Leaving Paradise: My Expat Adventure and Other Stories'' (Melbourne: Melbourne University Publishing, 2006), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; travelling through Europe and Iran before settling in London in 1968, where Carey continued to write highly regarded advertising copy and unpublished fiction.

==Middle career: 1970–1990==
Returning to Australia in 1970, Carey once again did advertising work in Melbourne and Sydney. He also kept writing, and gradually broke through with editors, publishing short stories in magazines and newspapers such as ''[[Meanjin]]'' and ''[[Nation Review]]''. Most of these were collected in his first book, ''The Fat Man In History'', which appeared in 1974. In the same year Carey moved to [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] in Sydney to work for [[Grey Global Group|Grey Advertising]].

In 1976, Carey moved to [[Queensland]] and joined an alternative community named Starlight in [[Yandina, Queensland|Yandina]], north of [[Brisbane]], with his new partner, the painter [[Margot Hutcheson]], with whom he lived in the 1970s and 1980s. He remained with Grey, writing in Yandina for three weeks, then spending the fourth week at the agency in Sydney. It was during this time that he produced most of the stories collected in ''War Crimes'' (1979), as well as ''[[Bliss (novel)|Bliss]]'' (1981), his first published novel.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Wroe, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jan/06/fiction.petercarey "Fiction's Great Outlaw",] ''The Guardian'', 5 January 2001. Retrieved 30 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey started his own advertising agency in 1980, the Sydney-based McSpedden Carey Advertising Consultants, in partnership with Bani McSpedden. After many years of separation, Leigh Weetman asked for a divorce in 1980 so that she could remarry and Peter agreed. In 1981, he moved to [[Bellingen, New South Wales|Bellingen]] in northern [[New South Wales]]. There he wrote ''[[Illywhacker]]'', published in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Vaughan [http://ehlt.flinders.edu.au/english/PeterCarey/Biography.html "Biography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116101229/http://ehlt.flinders.edu.au/english/PeterCarey/Biography.html |date=16 January 2013 }}, Peter Carey Website, 11 November 1997. Retrieved 30 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he married theatre director Alison Summers.  ''[[Illusion (musical)|Illusion]]'', a stage musical Carey wrote with Mike Mullins and composer [[Martin Armiger]], was performed at the 1986 [[Adelaide Festival of the Arts]] and a studio cast recording of the musical was nominated for a 1987 [[ARIA Award for Best Original Soundtrack, Cast or Show Album|ARIA Award]] (for which Carey as lyricist was nominated).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hawley|first1=Janet|title=In search of the truth and an entrepreneur|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ymtWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4001%2C5664924|accessdate=8 August 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=24 February 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQnfp4K4G4o | title = ARIA Awards 1987.mov | publisher = [[YouTube]].

The decade—and the Australian phase of Carey's career—culminated with the publication of ''[[Oscar and Lucinda]]'' (1988), which won the [[Booker Prize|Booker McConnell Prize]] (as it was then known) and brought the author international recognition. Carey explained that the novel was inspired, in part, by his time in Bellingen:

{{quote|I was living in Bellingen in the country. And the little church was down the road, and they wanted to take it away, zip: and I looked at that landscape and I thought – only 200 years ago this was a landscape that was full of Aboriginal stories. So I thought about a moment when that church that I knew, which was being removed from my landscape, might have arrived. I wanted it to arrive intact, whole. And I thought it would come on a barge. And, this is a totally irrational thought, it’s like a dream. I wanted this church, a wooden church, just what I saw, a church in that valley, to come along the Bellingen River on a barge gliding like a dream into the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sue Gillett, "''Oscar and Lucinda'': Shattering History’s Self-reflection", in Patrick Fuery (ed.), ''Representation, Discourse and Desire: Contemporary Australian Culture and Critical Theory'' (Melbourne: Longman Cheshire, 1994), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Move to New York: 1990–present==
Carey sold his share of McSpedden Carey and in 1990 moved with Alison Summers and their son to New York, where he took a job teaching creative writing at [[New York University]]. He later said that New York would not have been his first choice of place to live, and that moving there was his wife's idea.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Moore, [http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2005/mar/17/wrong-about-japan-fathers-journey-his-son/ "Wrong About Japan: A Father's Journey with His Son",] ''San Diego Reader'', 17 March 2005.

''[[The Tax Inspector]]'' (1991), begun in Australia, was the first book he completed in the United States. It was followed by ''[[The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith]]'' (1994), a fable in which he explored the relationship between Australia and America, disguised in the novel as "Efica" and "Voorstand". This is a relationship that has preoccupied him throughout his career, going back to ''[[Bliss (novel)|Bliss]]'' (1981), ''[[Illywhacker]]'' (1985), and the early short stories. Nevertheless, Carey continued to set his fiction primarily in Australia and remained diffident about writing explicitly on American themes. In a piece on ''[[True History of the Kelly Gang]]'' (2001), Mel Gussow reported that:

{{quote|Periodically he has thought about writing an American-based novel, and he had started one dealing with litigation. But he put it aside for [[Ned Kelly]]. Explaining why he continues to set most of his books in Australia, he recalled that one of his students said, "When you change countries you lose your peripheral vision." In that sense, his view of America is still limited. Writing about Australia—its history and its heroes—his perspective is wide and deep.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow, [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/15/books/championing-fabled-bandit-for-novelist-rogue-australian-sums-up-his-underdog.html "Championing a Fabled Bandit; For Novelist, a Rogue Australian Sums Up His Underdog Culture",] ''New York Times'',

It was only after nearly two decades in the United States that he embarked on ''[[Parrot and Olivier in America]]'' (2010), loosely based on events in the life of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]. Carey says "Tocqueville opened a door I could enter. I saw the present in the past. It was accessible, imaginable."&lt;ref&gt;Charles McGrath, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/books/27carey.html "Peter Carey: At Home in Australia, New York and Writing",] ''New York Times'', 26 April 2010. Retrieved 29 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Carey continues to extend his canvas; in his most recent novel, ''The Chemistry of Tears'' (2012), "contemporary London is brought intimately in touch with ... a 19th-century Germany redolent of the Brothers Grimm".&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca K.

==Controversies==
In 1998, Carey was accused of snubbing [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] by declining an invitation to meet her after winning the [[Commonwealth Writers Prize]] for ''[[Jack Maggs]]'' (1997). While Carey is a [[Australian republicanism|republican, in the Australian sense,]] he insists that no offence was intended:

{{quote|What happened, he explains, was that he had already been in England recently for a literary festival; he is booked for another trip soon, and had been travelling so much that he asked the prize organisers, "Would it be possible to see Her Majesty when I was actually in London?" "They thought it would be better just to cancel than for me to ask Her Majesty to do that. Then all this stuff started going out in English tabloids."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Attwood, "Carey on Dickens, the Queen and Ned Kelly", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 5 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The meeting did eventually take place, with the Queen remarking, according to Carey, "I believe you had a little trouble getting here."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/18542/ "The Great Australian Story is of Loss, Death",] ''Indian Express'', 17 February 2003. Retrieved 29 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unhappy circumstances of Carey's break-up with Alison Summers received publicity (largely in Australia) in 2006 when ''[[Theft: A Love Story]]'' appeared, depicting the toxic relationship between its protagonist, Butcher Bones, and his ex-wife, known only as "the Plaintiff".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Wyndham, [http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/a-lovehate-story/2006/03/30/1143441267032.html "A Love–Hate Story",] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 1 April 2006.

Retrieved 30 March 2012. See also  Wyndham, "Ex-wife Comes Out Swinging", and Goldenberg, "Two Scribes Go to War".&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015 he, alongside [[Michael Ondaatje]], [[Francine Prose]], [[Teju Cole]], [[Rachel Kushner]] and [[Taiye Selasi]], withdrew from the PEN American Center gala honouring the French satirical magazine ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' with its "Freedom of Expression Courage" award.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/27/peter-carey-among-writers-to-protest-pen-honour-for-charlie-hebdo&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that one of his reasons for doing so was "PEN’s seeming blindness to the cultural arrogance of the French nation, which does not recognise its moral obligation to a large and disempowered segment of their population.".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/nyregion/six-pen-members-decline-gala-after-award-for-charlie-hebdo.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 204&lt;ref&gt;https://theintercept.com/2015/04/30/145-pen-writers-thus-far-objected-charlie-hedbo-award-6/&lt;/ref&gt; PEN members, including Teju Cole and Deborah Eisenberg,&lt;ref&gt;https://theintercept.com/2015/04/27/read-letters-comments-pen-writers-protesting-charlie-hebdo-award/&lt;/ref&gt; wrote to PEN, objecting to its decision to give the award to Charlie Hebdo.

'''Peter Sydney Ernest Lawford''' (born '''Peter Sydney Ernest Aylen'''; 7 September 1923 – 24 December 1984) was a British actor, producer, and socialite, who lived in the United States throughout his adult life.&lt;ref name=lawford34/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hischak|2008|p=420}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WVobit"&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', 26 December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the "[[Rat Pack]]" and the brother-in-law of [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]], and the senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Edward Kennedy]]. From the 1940s to the 1960s, he was a well-known celebrity and starred in a number of highly acclaimed films. In later years, he was noted more for his off-screen activities as a celebrity than for his acting; it was said that he was "famous for being famous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/109743%7C124097/Peter-Lawford/biography.html|title=Biography for Peter Lawford|website=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in London in 1923, he was the only child of [[Lieutenant General]] Sir [[Sydney Turing Barlow Lawford]], [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] (1865–1953) and May Sommerville Bunny (1883–1972). At the time of Peter's birth, however, his mother was married to [[Lieutenant colonel]] Dr Ernest Vaughn Aylen D.S.O,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=ROYAL ARMY MEDICAL CORPS. |journal=London Gazette |date=3 July 1923 |issue=32841 |page=4617 |url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/32841/page/4617 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of Sir Sydney's officers, while his father was married to Muriel Williams.&lt;ref name=lawford34/&gt; At the time, May and Ernest Aylen were living apart. May confessed to Aylen that the child was not his, a revelation that resulted in a double divorce. Sydney and May wed in September 1924 after their divorces were finalised and when their son was one year old.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wayne|2006|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawford's family was connected to the English aristocracy through his uncle Ernest Lawford's wife (a daughter of the 14th [[Earl of Eglinton]]) as well as his aunt Ethel Turner Lawford (who married a son of the 1st [[Baron Avebury]]). His aunt, Jessie Bruce Lawford, another of his father's sisters, was the second wife of the Hon [[Hartley Williams]], senior [[puisne judge]] of the Supreme Court of the colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia. A relative, through his mother, was Australian artist [[Rupert Bunny]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} 

He spent his early childhood in France and, owing to his family's travels, was never formally educated. Instead, he was schooled by governesses and tutors, and his education included tennis and ballet lessons.&lt;ref name=lawford44&gt;{{harv|Lawford|1986|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In the beginning," his mother observed, "he had no homework. When he was older he had Spanish, German and music added to his studies. He read only selected books: English fairy stories, English and French classics; no crime stories.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Having studied Peter for so long, I decided he was quite unfitted for any career except art, so I cut [[Latin]], [[Algebra]], high mathematics and substituted dramatics instead."&lt;ref name=lawford44/&gt; Because of the widely varying national and religious backgrounds of his tutors, Lawford "attended various services in churches, cathedrals, synagogues and for some time was an usher in a [[Christian Science]] Sunday School...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lawford|1986|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1930, aged seven, he made his acting debut in the English film ''[[Poor Old Bill]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/peter-lawford-mn0000845153|title=Peter Lawford - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 14, Lawford severely injured his right arm in an accident when it went through a glass door.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury greatly compromised the use of his lower arm and hand with irreversible nerve damage,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he later learned to hide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wayne|2006|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury was judged to be serious enough to prevent his entrance into the armed forces, which his parents had planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Lawford decided to pursue a career as an actor, a decision that resulted in one of his aunts refusing to leave him her considerable fortune, as originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lawford|1986|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Films===
[[File:Peter Lawford in The Picture of Dorian Gray trailer cropped.jpg|thumb|left|150px|In ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1945)]]

Lawford's first film role was at age seven in the British film ''Poor Old Bill''.

Prior to the [[Second World War]], Lawford was offered a contract by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. In 1938, he made his Hollywood debut in a minor part in the film ''[[Lord Jeff]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Fanny Brice to Team in Comedy: Nan Grey Assigned Novel Short Planned Diamond Story Set Film World Pageant", ''Los Angeles Times'' (1923–Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif], 24 March 1938, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; His first role in a major film production was in ''[[A Yank at Eton]]'' (1942), starring [[Mickey Rooney]], in which Lawford played a snobbish bully.&lt;ref&gt;"DRAMA: Alice Faye to Return in 'Frisco' Feature 'Hattie' Work Resumed Glider Yarn Announced Three Holt Films Set Texas 'Find' Gets Role Rowe to Screen-Debut", ''Los Angeles Times'' (1923–Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif], 7 April 1942, p. A8.&lt;/ref&gt; He had uncredited roles as a [[pilot (aircraft)|pilot]] in ''[[Mrs. Miniver]]'' (1942) and as a sailor in ''[[Sherlock Holmes Faces Death]]'' (1943).&lt;ref name=IMDBLaw&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Lawford IMDb profile|accessdate=26 April 2017|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0492444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MGM career===
In June 1943, MGM signed Lawford to a long-term contract. His first role under this was ''[[The White Cliffs of Dover (film)|The White Cliffs of Dover]]'' (1944), in which he played a young soldier during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Universal to Make 'Chamber of Horrors' – Bogart Ban Lifted – 4 New Films This Week, ''The New York Times'' (1923–Current file) [New York, NY], 7 June 1943: p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; MGM gave him another important role in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1945). Lawford's first leading role came in ''[[Son of Lassie]]'' (1945), and he later won a ''[[Modern Screen]]'' magazine readers' poll as the most popular actor in Hollywood of 1946. His fan mail jumped to thousands of letters a week.&lt;ref name=IMDBLaw/&gt;
[[File:Peter Lawford in Royal Wedding.jpg|thumb|110px|In ''[[Royal Wedding]]'' (1951)]]
With actors such as [[Clark Gable]] and [[James Stewart]] away at war, Lawford was recognised as a new romantic lead on the MGM lot. Lawford's busiest year as an actor was 1946, when two of his films opened within days of each other: ''[[Cluny Brown]]'' and ''[[Two Sisters from Boston]]''. He made his first comedy film that year, ''[[My Brother Talks to Horses]]'' (released in 1947). He appeared with [[Frank Sinatra]] for the first time in the musical ''[[It Happened in Brooklyn]]'' (1947). Lawford received rave reviews for his work in the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Sinatra's were lukewarm.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Lawford later admitted that the most terrifying experience of his career was the first musical number he performed in the musical ''[[Good News (1947 film)|Good News]]'' (1947). Using an American accent for his role, he won acclaim as a performer. Over the next few years, he was given supporting roles in MGM films, including ''[[On an Island with You]]'' (1948), ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' (1948), ''[[Little Women (1949 film)|Little Women]]'' (1949), ''[[Royal Wedding]]'' (1951) and ''[[You for Me]]'' (1952).&lt;ref name=IMDBLaw/&gt;

===Post-MGM===
[[File:Exodus 1960.jpg|thumb|[[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Paul Newman]] and Lawford in ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]'' (1960)]]
Lawford's first film after Metro released him and several other players from their contracts was the comedy ''[[It Should Happen to You]]'', wherein he starred alongside [[Judy Holliday]] and [[Jack Lemmon]]. In 1959, Sinatra invited Lawford to join the "[[Rat Pack]]" and also got him a role in ''[[Never So Few]]''. The casino caper ''[[Ocean's 11]]'' (1960) was a project Lawford first brought to Sinatra's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other films included the acclaimed Israeli-set drama ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]'' (1960); ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962), a war film with a star-studded cast; and the political drama ''[[Advise &amp; Consent]]'' (1962) (in which he played a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]]).&lt;ref name=IMDBLaw/&gt; He reunited with the Rat Pack for the western adventure ''[[Sergeants 3]]''.

In 1961, Lawford and his manager Milt Ebbins formed ''Chrislaw Productions'', which was named after Peter's son Christopher,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced the 1963 action film ''[[Johnny Cool]]'' starring [[Henry Silva]] and [[Elizabeth Montgomery]]. He went on to produce the 1965 [[Patty Duke]] film ''[[Billie (film)|Billie]]'' as well as two films with Sammy Davis, Jr., ''[[Salt and Pepper (film)|Salt and Pepper]]'' and ''[[One More Time (1970 film)|One More Time]]''. He returned to MGM for ''[[They Only Kill Their Masters]]'' (1972), which reunited him with several former MGM contract players. His last role was as Montague Chippendale in ''[[Where Is Parsifal?]]'' (1983).&lt;ref name=IMDBLaw/&gt;

Lawford made his television debut in 1953 in a guest-starring role on [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[anthology series]] ''[[General Electric Theater]]''. In 1954, he starred as a newspaper advice-to-the-lovelorn columnist named Bill Hastings in the short-lived [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] series ''[[Dear Phoebe]]'' with [[Marcia Henderson]] and [[Charles Lane (actor)|Charles Lane]].&lt;ref name=IMDBLaw/&gt;

From 1957 to 1959, Lawford co-starred with [[Phyllis Kirk]] in ''[[The Thin Man (TV series)|The Thin Man]]'', an NBC series from MGM based on [[The Thin Man|the novel]] by [[Dashiell Hammett]]. He had a recurring role on ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'' from 1971 to 1973 as the love interest to [[Doris Day|Day's]] character.&lt;ref name=IMDBLaw/&gt; 

Lawford guest-starred on various television series, including ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'', ''[[The Martha Raye Show]]'', ''[[Schlitz Playhouse of Stars]]'', ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' and ''[[The Bob Cummings Show]]''.&lt;ref name=IMDBLaw/&gt; 

Aside from guest spots, he also guest-starred on variety shows, such as ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'' and ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'', and game shows, such as ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'' and ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]''.&lt;ref name=IMDBLaw/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:JFKWHP-KN-C23203-President John F Kennedy and Peter Lawford Aboard the Yacht Manitou.jpg|250px|thumb|Lawford sailing with his brother-in-law President [[John F. Kennedy]] aboard the yacht "[[S/Y Manitou|Manitou]]", a former USCG training vessel that was used as a "floating White House', off the coast of Johns Island, Maine, August 12, 1962]]
His first marriage, in 1954, was to socialite [[Patricia Helen Kennedy|Pat Kennedy]], a younger sister of then-US Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] (D-MA). They had four children: a son, actor and author [[Christopher Lawford]] (1955−2018), and daughters Sydney Maleia Lawford (b. 1956), Victoria Francis Lawford (b. 1958), and Robin Elizabeth Lawford (b. 1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kennedy clan a US dynasty |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24853722/lawfords_children/ |accessdate=26 October 2018 |publisher=The Courier-News |date=26 Apr 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawford became an American citizen on 23 April 1960. He had prepared for this in time to vote for his brother-in-law in the upcoming [[US presidential election, 1960|presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawford, along with other members of the "[[Rat Pack]]", helped campaign for Kennedy and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinatra famously dubbed him "Brother-in-Lawford" at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Schroeder|2004|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawford and Patricia Kennedy divorced in February 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rorabaugh|2002|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawford was originally cast as Alan A. Dale in the film ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' but was replaced by [[Bing Crosby]] following a break in Sinatra's relationship with Lawford. The break stemmed from a scheduled visit to Sinatra's home by Lawford's brother-in-law, President Kennedy, during a 1962 West Coast trip. Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], who was long concerned about Sinatra's rumoured ties with underworld figures, encouraged the President to change his plans and stay at Crosby's home, which (it was maintained) could provide better security for the President. The change came at the last minute, after Sinatra had made extensive arrangements for the promised and eagerly awaited presidential visit, including the construction of a [[helipad]]. Sinatra was furious, believing that Lawford had failed to intercede with the Kennedys on his behalf, and ostracised him from the [[Rat Pack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|pp=292–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sinatra and Lawford's friendship was over. They only spoke when Sinatra called after his son [[Frank Sinatra Jr.]] was kidnapped on 8 December 1963, and he needed the help of Lawford's brother-in-law [[Robert Kennedy]], then Attorney General. With the exception of Vice-President [[Hubert H. Humphrey]]'s 1968 presidential race, Sinatra never endorsed another Democratic candidate. Crosby, a staunch Republican, ended up cast in Lawford's role.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawford married his second wife, Mary Rowan, daughter of comedian [[Dan Rowan]], in October 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|pp=410, 408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowan and Lawford separated two years later and divorced in January 1975. In June 1976 he married aspiring actress Deborah Gould, whom he had known for three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|p=433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawford and Gould separated two months after marrying and divorced in 1977. Following the divorce, Lawford moved into the [[Sierra Towers]] where he lived for the next few years on the thirtieth floor. During his separation from Gould, Lawford met Patricia Seaton who became his fourth and final wife in July 1984, just months before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bly|1999|pp=187–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Lawford died at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve 1984, aged 61, from cardiac arrest. He had suffered from kidney and liver failure after years of substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|p=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was cremated, and his ashes were interred at [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|p=469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to a dispute between his widow and the cemetery, Lawford's ashes were removed from the cemetery in 1988 and scattered into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California by his widow Patricia Seaton Lawford, who invited the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' tabloid to photograph the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spada|1991|pp=470–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his contribution to the television industry, Peter Lawford has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] located at 6920&amp;nbsp;Hollywood Blvd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/peter-lawford|title=Peter Lawford &amp;#124; Hollywood Walk of Fame|publisher=Walkoffame.com|date=8 February 1960|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A comprehensive competition law was first proposed in the late 1980s during the administration of President [[Cory Aquino]].&lt;ref name="RapplerJuly2015" /&gt;

The Philippines was the only country in [[ASEAN]] without a competition law and the integration of ASEAN into a single market was an impetus to pass the act.&lt;ref name="RapplerJuly2015" /&gt;

'''Plastics News''' is a weekly, 46,000-circulation trade newspaper delivering global news to a primarily North American market. Founded by [[Crain Communications Inc.]] in [[Akron, Ohio]], in 1989, it covers the business of the global [[plastics industry]]. The publication relocated to Crain's corporate headquarters in Detroit in 2013.

''Plastics News'' focuses on commercial, financial, legislative and market-related developments worldwide that affect North American plastic product manufacturers and their suppliers and customers. The publication launched a Web site in 1996.

Today it is part of the [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crain-communications-forms-crains-global-polymer-group-300153015.html Crain Global Polymer Group]. The group started to take shape after Crain’s purchase in July 2007 of the UK-based polymer publishing assets of Emap Communications Ltd. Plastics News and its sister publications together comprise the world's largest plastics publishing organization. Owned by the privately held Crain Communications Inc., these brands – which include Plastics News, Plastics News China, Plastics News Europe and Plastics &amp; Rubber Weekly – encompass three print publications, four websites, more than a dozen eNewsletters, multiple conferences and some industry award programs. Other polymer-related publications owned by Crain include Rubber &amp; Plastics News, European Rubber Journal, Urethanes Technology International and Tire Business.

The U.S. publication launched its [http://PlasticsNews.com PlasticsNews.com] website in 1996, and today that audited site attracts more than 80,000 unique visitors per month. The company launched its bilingual '''Plastics News China''' as a free e-mail newsletter in May 2005, along with a companion Plastics News China website. Both products are offered in English and simplified Chinese.

Plastics News organizes several events, including its annual Executive Forum and various business conferences in North America, covering such topics as automotive, medical devices, plastic caps and closures, workforce issues, sustainability, packaging and more. These serve as forums to present new products and ideas and for independent discussion of issues of concern to the industry.

Since 1996, ''PN'' has given its [http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/99999999/STATIC/130119992 Processor of the Year Award] to a North American plastics processor, and it honors the winner in a ceremony each year at the Executive Forum. Beginning in 2011, it also began to present three '''PN Excellence Awards''' to processors for excelling in customer relations, employee relations and industry/public service. ''Plastics News'' also started giving out [http://bestplacestoworkplastics.com/ Best Places to Work in Plastics] awards in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="706">A '''production write-through contract''' is an arrangement, specific to the [[film industry]], where a [[screenwriter]] enters into a commercial agreement with a studio that guarantees the screenwriter the right to do all the necessary rewrites to his or her screenplay.  The screenwriter will be on the set throughout the production of the film, and will do the rewrites that a [[production rewriter]] would otherwise do.&lt;ref&gt;A book about entertainment law is required as a proper source for this term.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Protection or Free Trade''''' is a book published in 1886 by the [[economist]] and [[social philosopher]], [[Henry George]]. Its sub-title is '''''An Examination of the Tariff Question with Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor.''''' As the title suggests, George examined the debate between [[protectionism]] and [[free trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truefreetrade.org/pft16.htm "Inadequacy of the Free Trade Argument", Chapter 16, ''Protection or Free Trade'']&lt;/ref&gt;

George was opposed to [[tariffs]], which were at the time both the major method of [[protectionist]] trade policy and an important source of federal revenue. He argued that tariffs kept prices high for consumers, while failing to produce any increase in overall wages. He also believed that tariffs protected monopolistic companies from competition, thus augmenting their power. Like [[Progress and Poverty]], much of the book was devoted to attacking privileges, such as land monopoly, which limit trade and rob value from producers.

Largely as a result of this book, free trade became a major issue in federal politics. ''Protection or Free Trade'' was the first book to be read entirely into the [[Congressional Record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = George | first = Henry | title = The annotated works of Henry George | publisher = Fairleigh Dickinson University Press The Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing Group, Inc., Robert Schalkenbach Foundation | location = Madison New Jersey Lanham, Maryland New York, NY | year = 2016 | isbn = 1611477018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was read aloud by five Democratic congressmen.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, "A Fragile Alliance," 425–425&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7qlMAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=protection+or+free+trade&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Xq_7Tv6ELsWCtgePkZDRBg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=protection%20or%20free%20trade&amp;f=false ''Protection or Free Trade: An Examination of the Tariff Question, with Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor''](New York: 1887).&lt;/ref&gt;

=="True free trade"==
George defended what he considered "true free trade". For him, this required free trade to be coupled with the treatment of [[land (economics)|land]] as [[common property]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Free trade means free production. Now fully to free production it is necessary not only to remove all taxes on production, but also to remove all other restrictions on production. True free trade, in short, requires that the active factor of production, Labor, shall have free access to the passive factor of production, Land. To secure this all monopoly of land must be broken up, and the equal right of all to the use of the natural elements must be secured by the treatment of the land as the common property in [[usufruct]] of the whole people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truefreetrade.org/pft20.htm "True Free Trade", Chapter 20, ''Protection or Free Trade'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Acclaim==
In 1997, [[Spencer MacCallum]] wrote that Henry George was "undeniably the greatest writer and orator on free trade who ever lived."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacCallum |first1=Spencer H. |title=The Alternative Georgist Tradition |journal=Fragments |date=Summer–Fall 1997 |volume=35 |url=http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/maccallum-spencer_alternative-georgist-tradition-1997-02.pdf |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Tyler Cowen]] wrote that George's 1886 book ''Protection or Free Trade'' "remains perhaps the best-argued tract on free trade to this day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=Anti-Capitalist Rerun |journal=The American Interest |date=May 1, 2009 |volume=4 |issue=5 |url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2009/05/01/anti-capitalist-rerun/ |accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim Powell (historian)|Jim Powell]] said that ''Protection or Free Trade'' was probably the best book on trade written by anyone in the [[Americas]], comparing it [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[Wealth of Nations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Obenhaus|first1=Matthew|title=Free Trade Lessons for the Economically Challenged|url=https://gymnasiumsite.wordpress.com/2016/03/07/free-trade-lessons-for-the-economically-challenged/|website=The Gymnasium|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Friedman]] said it was the most rhetorically brilliant work ever written on trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powell|first1=Jim|title=Milton Friedman’s Favorite Book on Trade|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/milton-friedmans-favorite-book-on-trade-1465597043|accessdate=17 March 2018|agency=Wall Street Journal|date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman also paraphrased one of George's arguments in favor of free trade: "It’s a very interesting thing that in times of war, we blockade our enemies in order to prevent them from getting goods from us. In time of peace we do to ourselves by tariffs what we do to our enemy in time of war.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Obenhaus|first1=Matthew|title=Free Trade Lessons for the Economically Challenged|url=https://gymnasiumsite.wordpress.com/2016/03/07/free-trade-lessons-for-the-economically-challenged/|website=The Gymnasium|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oswald Garrison Villard]] said, "Few men made more stirring and valuable contributions to the economic life of modern America than did Henry George,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=House Congressional Record|date= 1935|page=10630|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1935-pt10-v79/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1935-pt10-v79-3-2.pdf|accessdate=20 March 2018}} US Representative [[Charles R. Eckert]] quoting Villard&lt;/ref&gt; and that what George had "written about protection and free trade is as fresh and as valuable today as it was at the hour in which it was penned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burrows|first1=Waters Field|title=Government by Quinary Civic Councils|date=1934|publisher=USA Federal government|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cP7fYDegZ1MC|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Demján was born in [[Börvely]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Kingdom of Hungary]] (present-day [[Berveni]], [[Satu Mare County]], [[Romania]]). His father, from a family of [[Székelys]], had moved there in 1940, but was killed during [[World War II]]. His mother, a [[Danube Swabian]] from [[Etyek]], moved to Börvely after being displaced in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magyarnarancs.hu/belpol/demjan_sandor_portreja_-_i_resz_a_varosalakito-62549|title=Demján Sándor portréja - I. rész: A városalakító|website=magyarnarancs.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; On scholarship, he graduated in 1965 from the Budapest Trade and Tourism College at [[Budapest Business School]].

==Business career==
Demján became president of the Gorsium ÁFÉSZ from 1968 to 1973, and from 1973 to 1986, was a co-CEO of their joint venture.&lt;ref&gt;Magyar Sportévkönyv 2001. Aréna 2000-2001. {{ISSN|1218-0807}} (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; From 1986 to 1990, he was the president and one of the founders of the Hungarian Credit Bank. Since 1990, he has been part of the Central European Development Corporation, and in 1991, he was CEO of the Central European Investment Company. In 1996, he inaugurated the opening of the Bank Center, the Granite Pole, and the Pólus Center. In 1996, he became the chairman of [[TriGránit]]. In 1999, he also inaugurated the [[WestEnd City Center]], followed in 2000 by the Polus City Center in [[Bratislava]] opening, and, in 2005, the Silesia City Center in [[Katowice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napigazdasag.hu/default.asp?cCenter=wiw/person.asp&amp;cMenu=WH&amp;nid=1569] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013225607/http://napigazdasag.hu/default.asp?cCenter=wiw%2Fperson.asp&amp;cMenu=WH&amp;nid=1569 |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wealth has been estimated to HUF 300 billion in assets in 2008; At the time, he was Hungary's richest man. His assets in 2006 has been estimated at HUF 80 billion; In just over two years, his capital almost quadrupled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hetilap.hetek.hu/index.php?lap=613&amp;rovat=5000 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029210208/http://hetilap.hetek.hu/index.php?lap=613&amp;rovat=5000 |archivedate=2007-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he founded the [[Prima Primissima Award]], dedicated to the protection of Hungarian intellectual achievements, the development of domestic science, and the strengthening of arts and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primissima.hu/prima-primissima-dijak-dija|title=Prima Primissima|website=primissima.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he offered a significant part of his assets up for charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.origo.hu/gazdasag/20120928-szegenyekre-es-muveszekre-hagyom-a-vagyonom-interju-demjan-sandorral.html?fb_action_ids=348282698596296&amp;fb_action_types=og.recommends&amp;fb_source=aggregation&amp;fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582|title=Demján Sándor: Szegényekre és művészekre hagyom a vagyonom|first=New Wave Media Group|last=Kft.|website=origo.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Demján announced that, due to age, he would gradually recede in business life, and management of his subordinate companies will be passed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napi.hu/magyar_vallalatok/milliardos_bukas_es_elkepeszto_osztalek_demjan_cegbirodalmaban.582781.html|title=Milliárdos bukás és elképesztő osztalék Demján cégbirodalmában|first=|last=www.napi.hu|website=Napi.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Commitment Engine: Making Work Worth It''''' is the third book by [[John Jantsch]].&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;Schawbel, Dan. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2012/10/11/is-the-work-you-do-worthwhile/ Is the work you do worthwhile?]. Forbes. October 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a follow up of Jantsch's previous book, ''The Referral Engine'', and teaches readers how to establish lasting commitment in their employees, customers, and businesses and explores what makes some businesses worth referring.&lt;ref name=comittmentengine&gt;{{cite book|last=Jantsch|first=John|title=The Commitment Engine: Making Work Worth It|year=2012|publisher=Portfolio|isbn=1591844878|pages=256|url=http://www.thecommitmentengine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Synopsis==
The book developed out of Jantsch's quest to understand why one successful [[entrepreneur]] can be fulfilled by their business while another successful entrepreneur cannot, which led him the commitment connection.&lt;ref name=v3im&gt;Kramer, Shelly. [http://www.v3im.com/2012/10/commitment-engine-how-to-make-work-worth-it/#axzz2ABF7nyuZ Commitment Engine: How to make it worth it]. v3 Integrated Marketing. October 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Commitment Engine'' looks into what makes some businesses worth referring – and according to [[Jantsch]], it’s the commitment engine that drives the success of these businesses.&lt;ref name=Smallbiztrends&gt;Taylor, Ivana. [http://smallbiztrends.com/2012/10/the-commitment-engine-book-review.html The Commitment Engine Inspires Small Business Growth]. “Small Business Trends”. October 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also looks into what creates great [[company culture]].&lt;ref name=KCLibrary&gt;{{cite web|last=Jantsch|first=John|title=John Jantsch - The Commitment Engine: Making Work Worth It|url=http://www.kclibrary.org/event/john-jantsch-commitment-engine-making-work-worth-it|publisher=KC Library|accessdate=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is divided up into three parts:

#The Path, which explores clarity of purpose, passion and the strategies used to bring purpose to life in your work.
#The Patron, which shows how to become a supportive leader who pulls all these characteristics together inside business.

'''Theophostic Counseling''' was developed in the United States during the mid-1990s  Ed Smith, a Baptist minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equip.org/articles/theophostic-prayer-ministry-part-one-/ "Theophostic Prayer Ministry (Part One) – Christian Prayer, Occult Visualization, or Secular Psychotherapy?"], ''Christian Research Journal'', volume 29, number 3 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; After concerns about legal liabilities associated with offering counseling services, Smith later changed the name to '''Theophostic Prayer Ministry'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theophostic.com/resources/1/pdf/PST001.pdf], "Christian Research Institute" Position Paper: PST001, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Its name comes from the Greek ''theo'' (God) and quasi-Greek ''phostic'' (light), and it is often associated with the Christian [[Inner Healing Movement]]. Smith says people are being delivered from phobias, depressions, anxiety disorders, [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]]s, dissociative personality disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, sexual addictions, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, and homosexuality through Theophostic principles. The name Theophostic is a registered trademark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theophostic.com/aboutus.aspx]''Business Information'' paragraph on ''About Us'' page of www.theophostic.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/february5/19.18.html?start=2 |title=''Christianity Today'', February&amp;nbsp;5, 2001 |publisher=Christianitytoday.com |date=February 5, 2001 |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few empirical evaluations of Theophostic Ministry are available, although Christian psychologist Fernando Garzon says that current case study and survey data has yielded clinically significant changes in client symptom levels, and high degrees of client and practitioner satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.counseling.org/knowledge-center/vistas/by-year2/vistas-2004/docs/default-source/vistas/vistas_2004_26 Cognitive restructuring through contemplative inner healing prayer.] ''VISTAS: Perspectives on Counseling'' American Counseling Association Press, Garzon, F. (2004).]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Smith's definition of Theophostic Prayer Ministry is that "Theophostic is a ministry of helping emotionally wounded people to acknowledge and to identify the true source of their inner emotional pain and find lasting peace through receiving personalized truth directly from the Lord."&lt;ref name="Smith 2004"&gt;Smith, Ed M. ''Freedom from Performance-based Spirituality'', DVD, Theophostic Prayer Ministry (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
Smith lists fourteen basic principles of Theophostic Prayer Ministry,:&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Edward M. ''Healing Life’s Hurts through Theophostic Prayer'', p. 39, New Creation Publishing (2002, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

1.  Our present situation is rarely the cause of our ongoing emotional pain.
 
2.  Everything we presently know, feel or are mentally aware of has its roots in a first-time experience.

3.  If we try to resolve our present conflicts without resolving our historical lie-based woundedness, we will find only temporary relief for our emotional pain. However, if we find renewal for our past, we can redeem our present.

4.  Since many of the negative emotions we currently feel are reflections of the past, they provide opportunities for the wounds of our lives to be exposed and thus for renewal to occur.

5.  To facilitate emotional renewal, we need to identify the three basic elements in the renewal process: (1) the present emotional pain, (2) the original memory container and (3) the original lie(s) implanted in the memory container.

6.  People are in emotional bondage due to two basic factors, belief and choice. These two factors are rooted in the context of deception.

7.  When we believe a lie, the outcome will often have much the same consequences as though it were true.

8.  To be free of the lies we believe, we must identify and own the lies rather than suppress or deny we believe them before we can be free from them.

9.  In the midst of our “darkness”, we must come to realize how utterly bound we are to the lie and how helpless we are to overcome its debilitating grip on our lives apart from God’s divine intervention.

10. No person, including ourselves, is capable of talking us out of the lies we believe. We will be free only when we receive the truth from the One who is Truth (John 14:6, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life").

11. When we know the truth experientially, having received truth from God in our memory experience, we can walk in genuine maintenance-free victory in these areas of our lives.

12. In time of crisis or in emotionally charged life situations, our experiential knowledge tends to override our logical truth.

13. Lie-based pain can only be removed as the lies causing the pain are replaced with truth, whereas, sin-based pain can only be dealt with through the cross of Jesus.

14. Mind renewal is a lifelong process.

== The Theophostic Prayer Ministry Process ==
Participants in a typical Theophostic Prayer Ministry session are the ministry recipient, a ministry facilitator and optionally a prayer partner.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.82, 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry facilitator ensures that the ministry recipient understands the process before the session begins.&lt;ref&gt;Garzon, Fernando, Psy.D., Editor (2008). ''Pursuing Peace – Case Studies Exploring the Effectiveness of Theophostic Prayer Ministry'', p. 59. Xulon Press. {{ISBN|978-1-60647-202-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

The facilitator begins the session with a prayer of encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.93, 225&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry recipient closes his eyes and concentrates on feeling the emotional pain from which he is seeking relief. The purpose of focusing on the emotion is to allow his mind to drift back to a related memory&lt;ref name="CRJ2"&gt;[http://www.equip.org/articles/theophostic-prayer-ministry-part-one-/ "Theophostic Prayer Ministry (Part One) – Christian Prayer, Occult Visualization, or Secular Psychotherapy?"], ''Christian Research Journal'', volume 29, number 3 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
. That memory is of a situation that the recipient regards as painful and which he has interpreted to form a belief about himself or his situation.&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt;  The event that is contained in the memory may have occurred many years ago, for example in the person’s childhood.&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt; The emotion provides a bridge to the belief.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Edward M. (2007). ''Theophostic Prayer Ministry, Basic Training Seminar 2007, DVD Sessions, Disk 1, New Creation Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry recipient describes the memory to the facilitator.&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt; The facilitator asks the recipient some questions that will enable the recipient to drill down to the core belief housed in this memory that is troubling him. The questions are not [[leading question]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Edward M. ''Healing Life’s Hurts through Theophostic Prayer'', Theophostic Prayer Ministry Guidelines, p. 256, New Creation Publishing (2002, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; as the facilitator does not assume anything about the memory’s content. Rather they are open questions, posed to help the recipient himself to identify the core belief. This core belief is known in TPM parlance as a “lie” that causes lie-based pain. The lie arises from the recipient’s interpretation of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Edward M. ''Healing Life’s Hurts through Theophostic Prayer'', p. 145, New Creation Publishing (2002, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a rape victim may have formed a belief that she is dirty or shameful, whereas she was actually an innocent victim. Though her belief is false, it has the same impact on her emotional state now as if it were true.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the recipient has identified the core troublesome belief, the facilitator prays, asking the Lord Jesus to provide the recipient with his perspective, that is, what he would like the recipient to know.&lt;ref name="Smith 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt; The Lord answers that prayer in various ways. He might provide his truth to the recipient by means of a mental picture, a feeling, a scripture, a word, a realization or some other way.&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt; The truth received from Jesus replaces the painful lie previously believed.&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt; The result is peace.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzon 2008, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Every person believes not just one, but many lies of the kind that lead to present emotional pain. Each lie can be eliminated with the same process.&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt;

== Research ==
In his 2008 book,&lt;ref&gt;Garzon 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Fernando Garzon, an associate professor in the Center for Counselling and Family Studies at Liberty University,&lt;ref&gt;Garzon 2008, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; describes his team’s two-year-long outcomes-based case study research project that evaluated TPM. The research team found very clear preliminary results that showed a correlation between TPM treatment and symptom reductions.&lt;ref name="Garzon 2008, p. 93"&gt;Garzon 2008, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;  Garzon wrote that the case studies strongly support the need for randomized comparative or control group studies.&lt;ref name="Garzon 2008, p. 93" /&gt;

Garzon had conducted preliminary practitioner studies in 2001 which showed promise, concluding that "...outcome-based case studies and randomized clinical trials should proceed on TPM to ascertain whether the therapeutic perception of efficacy displayed in this survey actually has merit..." He also found that a wide variety of people were practicing Theophostic Ministry at that time, including pastors, lay counselors, and psychologists. According to Garzon, this raised questions about some practitioners' level of training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h6x88387wv80341r/ |title=Theophostic Ministry: Preliminary Practitioner Survey – ''Pastoral Psychology'', Volume 53 Number May 5, 2005, Fernando Garzon and Margaret Poloma |issn=0031-2789 |accessdate=April 18, 2011 |doi=10.1007/s11089-005-2582-1 |volume=53 |issue=5 |journal=Pastoral Psychology |pages=387–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
A Kentucky journalist has associated Theophostic Prayer Ministry with [[Recovered Memory Therapy]], an approach now widely discredited after discovery of false memory phenomena&lt;ref name=Brandon1997&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brandon, S. |author2=Boakes, J. |author3=Glaser, D. |author4=Green, R. |author5=MacKeith, J. |author6= Whewell, P.  | year = 1997 | title = Reported recovered memories of child sexual abuse: Recommendations for good practice and implications for training, continuing professional development and research | journal = Psychiatric Bulletin | volume = 21 | pages = 663–665 | doi = 10.1192/pb.21.10.663 | issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
on the basis that Theophostic Prayer Ministry also presupposes the possibility of repression or [[Memory inhibition#Evidence against inhibition in memory|memory inhibition]],&lt;ref&gt;Controversial international ministry operates from Campbellsville – Central Kentucky News Journal, July 2, 2003 by Jan Fletcher&lt;/ref&gt; A critical entry from [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] also seeks to associate Theophostic Ministry with [[Recovered Memory Therapy]], although the article does not identify the aspects of Theophostic Prayer Ministry that merit the assertion. It also claims that Theophostic Prayer Ministry has added beliefs about [[demonic possession]], [[Satanic abuse|Satanic influence]], direct communication with "[[Jesus Christ]] or the Holy Spirit" and "unique concepts about the inner workings of the mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org//theophostic.htm |title=Menu: Theophostic Counseling |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org//theophostic3.htm |title=Theophostic Counseling (TPM) TPM counseling: the process and reaction |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Smith himself strongly repudiates Recovered Memory Therapy,&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; and in recent years he has taught that it is counter-productive to pursue or even allow demonic confrontations in a ministry session.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.124-126&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his Basic Training Seminar Manual (and in each of the training videos), Smith warns strongly against making any suggestions that might affect the actual content of a memory,&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.129-133&lt;/ref&gt; and he lists ten ways in which TPM differs from RMT.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.215-218&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, once a core belief about self has been identified through the memory (not in the memory per se), Smith does "invite the Lord" to speak truth to the ministry recipient concerning that belief.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article about TPM in the Christian Research Journal,&lt;ref name="CRJ2" /&gt; Elliot Miller said that to accuse TPM of practicing recovered memory therapy and visualization is to betray ignorance or bias against TPM that refuses to be corrected by clear and consistent facts.

A Christian psychologist, David Entwistle, has expressed concerns with its practice: "TPM follows in the lineage of 'healing of memory' techniques, though it departs from that lineage in a number of important respects. Numerous concerns exist surrounding insufficient attempts to ground TPM in biblical concepts; inadequate and often flawed explanations of basic psychological processes; dubious claims about the prevalence of [[Dissociative identity disorder|DID]], [[Satanic ritual abuse|SRA]], and demonic activity; estimates of traumatic abuse that exceed empirical findings; and the failure to sufficiently appreciate the possibility of [[iatrogenic]] memory contamination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6566/is_1_32/ai_n29090065/pg_10/?tag=content;col1 |title=Shedding light on Theophostic Ministry 1: practice issues – ''Journal of Psychology and Theology'', Spring 2004, by David N. Entwistle |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=May 14, 2002 |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entwistle raises concern over empirical validity, with questions about literal appearances of God, as Entwistle interprets claimed perceptions of truth, including spontaneous visualizations of Christ; ethical and legal issues relating to guarantees of healing; application of TPM to a variety of mental disorders without empirical validation; the legal question of whether it should be considered a religious intervention or a counseling procedure – and whether this was settled by changing the name from Theophostic Counseling to Theophostic Ministry; and the failure of Smith to welcome public analysis and critique of TPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6566/is_1_32/ai_n29090066/pg_8/?tag=content;col1 |title=Shedding light on Theophostic Ministry 2: ethical and legal issues – ''Journal of Psychology and Theology'', Spring 2004, by David N. Entwistle |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cumberland County, Maine, sexual-abuse charges against pastor Thomas Wright were laid after a church member's memory surfaced during Theophostic sessions, of Wright allegedly abusing a child. When the case went to trial in 2002, the charges were thrown out by the District Attorney because evidence was based on ‘unconventional and biased therapeutic methods’. The District Attorney noted that these methods were considered unreliable by the American Psychological Society. In Australia, a psychologist was found guilty of malpractice for using Theophostic methods in 2006 by the Queensland Health Practitioners Tribunal. The tribunal found that Irene Moreau, who practiced from a Christian counselling centre in Brisbane, 'inappropriately used Theophostic Prayer Ministry as a counselling technique'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-130383209.html |title=AAP General News (Australia) Article date: October&amp;nbsp;25, 2006 |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=October 25, 2006 |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of inner healing techniques such as TPM frequently do not have formal training in psychology or counseling, although Fernando Garzon suggests that this in many cases may be beneficial, saying: "...it may serve people who might not get help otherwise, cannot afford professional therapy, do not wish to use insurance, or have access to counseling limited by managed care. Others belong to churches in which the pastor is either not trained, not interested, or not available (due to having too many other pastoral duties) to meet the needs for pastoral counseling. Still others simply may trust lay people, whom they know, more than a therapist, whom they do not know. In addition, the training itself may benefit the lay counselors spiritually and emotionally."&lt;ref&gt;Lay Christian Counseling and Client Expectations for Integration in Therapy ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'' (in press) Garzon et al, Liberty University&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to questions about the efficacy, safety and reliability of TPM, it has also divided Christian observers with regard to the soundness of its theology. In the conclusion of their paper ''A theological analysis of Theophostic Ministry'', Bryan Maier and Philip Monroe put it this way: "...on the issues of sin and healing, the question remains for Christian counselors and the evangelical community as a whole as to whether Smith's "theological basis" is consistent with responsible biblical doctrine. We do not think that Smith has warrant to make this claim. Furthermore, we think these differences are so significant that we advise great caution before engaging in this ministry – whether as a client or as facilitator."&lt;ref name="maier"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maier|first1=Bryan N.|date=Fall 2003|title=A Theological Analysis Of Theophostic Ministry|url=http://www.galaxie.com/article/trinj24-2-01|journal=[[Trinity Journal (theology)|Trinity Journal]]|volume=24|issue=2|pages=169–188|issn=0360-3032|oclc=2243858|ref=maier}}&lt;!--|publisher=Trinity Evangelical Divinity School--&gt;&lt;!--http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=rfh&amp;AN=ATLA0001406507&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Timber Trade Federation (TTF)''', is a British federation of [[timber trade]]rs, founded in 1892 and based in [[London]]. It groups together more than 370 voluntary member companies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ttf.co.uk/about-ttf/members.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; operating as agents, importers, manufacturers, merchants and sawmillers. It is a member of the [[Confederation of Timber Industries]] (CTI) and the [[Confederation of British Industry ]] (CBI). TTF members are bound to satisfy specific criteria concerning sustainable sourcing and harvesting before joining the federation. In 2008 the Timber Trade Federation introduced its “Responsible Purchasing Policy” (RPP) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/UKTimberStatement08.pdf/$FILE/UKTimberStatement08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 adopted the [[European Union Timber Regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eutr2013/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
TTF operates through a Governing Board comprising representatives of the Product Divisions of [[softwood]], [[hardwood]] and [[panelling|panel]] products and representatives of all the member organisations. The Officers are directly elected and the Product Divisions are made up of elected members. The president of the board is Stephen B. King since June 2013.

{{trade bloc}}
'''Trade diversion''' is an [[economic]] term related to [[international economics]] in which [[trade]] is diverted from a more efficient exporter towards a less [[productive efficiency|efficient]] one by the formation of a [[free trade agreement]] or a [[customs union]]. Total cost of good becomes cheaper when trading within the agreement because of the low tariff. This is as compared to trading with countries outside the agreement with lower cost goods but higher tariff. The related term '''Trade creation''' is when the formation of a trade agreement between countries decreases of price of the goods for more consumers, and therefore increases overall trade. In this case the more efficient producer with the agreement increases trade.{{r|viner}}

The terms were used by [[Chicago school of economics|'old' Chicago School]] economist [[Jacob Viner]] in his 1950 paper ''The Customs Union Issue''.{{r|viner}}

An early use of the terms was by Jacob Viner in his 1950 paper ''The Customs Union Issue''.{{r|viner|viner2}} Later in same decade [[Richard Lipsey]] noted that not only the location of production but also the location of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of goods would be effected by trade agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipsey|first=Richard G.|date=1957|title=The Theory of Customs Unions: Trade Diversion and Welfare|jstor=2551626|journal=Economica|volume=24|issue=93|pages=40–46|doi=10.2307/2551626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Béla Balassa]] discussed the concepts in relation to the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]] in his paper 1967 ''Trade Creation and Trade Diversion in the European Common Market''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balassa|first=Bela|date=1967|title=Trade Creation and Trade Diversion in the European Common Market|jstor=2229344|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=77|issue=305|pages=1–21|doi=10.2307/2229344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Paul Oslington]]'s ''Contextual History, Practitioner History, and Classic Status: Reading Jacob Viner’s The Customs Union Issue reviewed'' revisited Viner's original paper.{{r|viner2}}

==Occurrence==

When a country applies the same tariff to all nations, it will always import from the most efficient producer, since the more efficient nation will provide the goods at a lower price. With the establishment of a bilateral or regional free trade agreement, that may not be the case.
If the agreement is signed with a less-efficient nation, it may well be that their products become cheaper in the importing market than those from the more-efficient nation, since there are taxes for only one of them. Consequently, after the establishment of the agreement, the importing country would acquire products from a higher-cost producer, instead of the low-cost producer from which it was importing until then. In other words, this would cause a trade diversion.

==Term==
The term was coined by [[Jacob Viner]] in ''The Customs Union Issue'' in 1950. In its literal meaning the term was however incomplete, as it failed to capture all welfare effects of discriminatory tariff liberalization, and it was not useful when it came to non-tariff barriers. Economists have however dealt with this incompleteness in two ways. Either they stretched the original meaning to cover all welfare effects, or they introduced new terms like [[trade expansion]] or internal versus external trade creation.

Viner's article became and still is the foundation of the theory of international economic integration. It considered only two states comparing their trade flows with the rest of the world after they abolish customs tariffs on inner border of their union. Following the fact that economic unions most often include more than 2 states, attempts have been made to increase the number of the states (3+world), but not so successfully, as they did not have as clear conclusions as Viner's.

Opposite to economically efficient trade creation effect, the trade diversion flow is cost-inefficient compared with the rest of the world. Balance between trade creation and trade diversion effects due to the creation of economic union makes the union either economically efficient (positive balance) or inefficient (negative balance). It is based on the fact that unification of states usually applies mergers of more than 1 sector in economy (even European Coal and Steel Union, which had 2 sectors only) leading to the creation of either trade creation or diversion effects.

Positive effects of trade diversion include increase of trade between unified states, increase of employment in manufacturing states inside the union consequently leading to increase of respective taxes and welfare.

== Downside==
Diverted trade may hurt the non-member nation economically and politically, and create a strained relationship between the two nations. The decreased output of the good or service traded from one nation with a high comparative advantage to a nation of lower comparative advantage works against creating more efficiency and therefore against more overall surplus. It is  widely believed by economists that trade diversion is harmful to consumers.
The dynamics of trade diversion was described by Ravshanbek Dalimov in 2009. He used similarity of trade flows to the flux of gas or liquid stimulated by the pressure difference, while the flows of trade flows are stimulated by the price difference. This allowed use of [[Navier-Stokes equations]] for the interregional dynamics of trade flows.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}
