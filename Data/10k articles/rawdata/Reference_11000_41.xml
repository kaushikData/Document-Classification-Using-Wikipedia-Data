[[File:Lkz.jpg|thumb|311 px|Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian, consisting of 20 volumes]]
'''Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian''' ({{lang-lt|Didysis lietuvių kalbos žodynas}} or ''Akademinis lietuvių kalbos žodynas'') is the complete [[thesaurus]] of the [[Lithuanian language]] and is one of the most extensive [[lexicography|lexicographical]] pieces in the world.

It contains more than half a million Lithuanian [[headword]]s, and is 20 volumes (22 thousand pages) long. Most words have an explanation of their usage, origins and area of usage with examples. The Dictionary contains words collected from all written forms, since the first Lithuanian [[publishing|published]] book in 1547 until 2001.

==History==
The idea of the Dictionary belongs to [[Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[philologist]] [[Kazimieras Būga]]. He started collecting material for the dictionary in 1902 and had over 617,000 cards with words, part of them from [[Antanas Juška]] dictionary. The first part of the dictionary was printed in 1924, the complete first volume in 1941 (letters A-B) under supervision of [[Juozas Balčikonis]]. The second volume appeared in 1947, and together with the first it was banned and hidden by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities because of ideological reasons. These volumes are now bibliographical rarities. The first and second volumes had to be republished later. Work continued as the third volume was published in 1956, although it was difficult under the Soviet regime; some words (especially religious) were forced to be omitted. The loss was restored after Lithuania [[History_of_Lithuania#Independent_modern_Lithuania_.281990-2007.29|regained independence]] and ideological barriers were removed.

The work on the dictionary took more than six decades by many generations of [[Linguistics|linguists]]. It was finished in 2005, and an online version has appeared.

The dictionary is available printed, on [[CD-ROM]] and online.

'''Aditya Arya Archive''' is one of the earliest photographic [[archive]]s in [[India]], engaged in the digitizing, documentation, annotation, restoration and preservation of photographic material of archival significance in India.&lt;ref name="adityaaryaarchive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adityaaryaarchive.com/#/-about-archive/about-aditya-arya-archive |title=About Aditya Arya Archive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102122358/http://www.adityaaryaarchive.com/ |archivedate=2 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="photoraj"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photoraj.com/collections/aditya-arya-archive |title=Aditya Arya Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311012144/http://www.photoraj.com/collections/aditya-arya-archive |archivedate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aditya Arya Archive is led by [[Aditya Arya]],&lt;ref name="photoraj" /&gt; who is an eminent commercial photographer.&lt;ref name="fravahr1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fravahr.org/spip.php?breve669 |title=Indian history in a yellow crate of negatives |publisher=fravahr.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918105047/http://www.fravahr.org/spip.php?breve669 |archive-date=18 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Aditya Arya Archive began with the historical collection of [[photojournalism|photojournalist]] [[Kulwant Roy]], presented to Aditya Arya.&lt;ref name="adityaaryaarchive1"/&gt; Roy (1914-1984) was among the handful of photojournalists in India who documented the eventful years immediately before and after [[Partition of India|independence]]. He was a close friend of the Arya family&lt;ref name="tehelka1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gadihoke |first=Sabeena |url=http://tehelka.com/story_main40.asp?filename=hub081108croniclesof_india.asp |title=Chronicles of India Beginning |magazine=Tehelka |volume=5 |issue=44 |date=2008-11-08 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left his surviving photographic [[negative (photography)|negatives]] and prints to Aditya Arya. These prints and negatives remained forgotten in boxes for nearly 23 years&lt;ref name="cnngo1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Patel |first=Alisha |url=http://www.cnngo.com/mumbai/none/visual-archives-kulwant-roy-529186 |title='History in the making': The visual archives of Kulwant Roy &amp;#124; CNN Travel |publisher=Cnngo.com |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; after his death, until their inheritor Aditya Arya, began restoring and cataloguing them.&lt;ref name="vedicbooks1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arya |first1=Aditya |last2=Kamtekar |first2=Indivar |title=History in the Making: The Visual Archives of Kulwant Roy |url=http://www.vedicbooks.net/history-in-the-making-the-visual-archives-of-kulwant-roy-p-15859.html |publisher=Vedic Books  |isbn=9788172238681 |year=2010 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive included many unpublished pictures of national leaders and events of the Indian pre and post-independence era&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hauzel |first=Hoihnu |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100516/jsp/graphiti/story_12450776.jsp |title=Making history click |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=Calcutta |date=2010-05-16 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were brought to the public domain after the establishment of the Aditya Arya Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pathak |first=Nilima |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/world/india/gandhi-s-story-in-photographic-detail-1.764140 |title=Gandhi's story in photographic detail |newspaper=Gulf News |location=Dubai |publisher=Al Nisr Publishing |date=2011-02-19 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the outcomes  of the unearthing and restoration process of the archive was that  many images from the last years of [[British Raj|British rule]] and the early decades after India’s independence, which were reprinted over the decades and credited to random journalists, turned out to be Roy’s work and have now been duly acknowledged.  One of many such images is the iconic 1939 photograph of [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] and [[Ali Jinnah]] in a heated argument, which has now been credited to Roy by Getty Images.&lt;ref name="vedicbooks1"/&gt;
Many historians believe that the archive may shed light on the key moments in India’s [[Indian independence movement|independence movement]].&lt;ref name="fravahr1"/&gt;

==Rare and iconic images from the Aditya Arya Archive==
Aditya Arya Archive contains some rare and iconic images from the period of India’s independence struggle and thereafter.&lt;ref name="cnngo1"/&gt; These include rare photographs of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Gandhi and [[Sardar Patel]] huddled in an animated discussion,&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"/&gt;  Mahatma Gandhi in debate with Mohd. Ali Jinnah, with whom he was seldom seen with, [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] sharing a laugh with Pt. Nehru, Pt. Nehru wearing khaki shorts heading to attend a Congress [[Seva Dal]] Volunteers rally in [[Kanpur]],&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"/&gt; Pt. Nehru in [[cricket]] gear, the [[Indian National Army Trials]], Pt. Nehru bidding farewell to his grandson [[Rajiv Gandhi]] as he leaves for a tour,&lt;ref name="tehelka1" /&gt; [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] meetings, [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] meetings,&lt;ref name="tehelka1"/&gt; Mahatma Gandhi’s visit to the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North West Frontier Province]], signing of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]], Mahatma Gandhi addressing the [[Indian National Army]] soldiers,&lt;ref name="cnngo1"/&gt; the [[Cripps' Mission]], a series documenting the development of the [[Bhakra Dam]] and photographs from the front of the [[Sino-Indian War]], etc.

==History in the making==
Taking a leap with the Kulwant Roy collection, the Aditya Arya Archive released a book, History in the making&amp;nbsp;– The visual archives of Kulwant Roy, in April 2010. The book has been published in hardback by HarperCollins Publishers India Ltd.&lt;ref name="cnngo1"/&gt;

Aditya Arya and Indivar Kametkar worked together on the book for nearly three years, putting together text and images to form a compelling visual narrative.&lt;ref name="cnngo1"/&gt; It is a visual documentary on the history of India from the 1930s to 1950s and some of Kulwant Roy’s original captions and the imprint of his own rubber stamp on several pages.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"/&gt; The forward has been written by India’s Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh.&lt;ref name="cnngo1"/&gt; [[File:Visual Archives of Kulwant Roy- Gandhi Collection 4.jpg|thumb|A [[India Photo Archive Foundation#Publications|collector's edition]] was launched titled 'Visual Archives of Kulwant Roy- Gandhi Collection by Aditya Arya Archive]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1950">'''''[[Amalgamated Meat Cutters]] v. Connally''''', 337 F.Supp. 737 (1971)  is a court case decided by the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] relating to the limits of the [[nondelegation doctrine]].  The district court upheld the delegation of [[legislative branch|legislative power]] to the [[executive branch]] that was contained in the [[Economic Stabilization Act]].  Even though the Act gave a broad grant of legislative power (what opponents called a "blank check"), the court reasoned that discretion of the executive branch would be limited by:

# The "broad equity standard inherent in a stabilization program" (i.e. the norms of rule of law and the history and tradition of executive regulation of the economy)
# The practice of "self-narrowing."  Specifically, the court believed that once the executive branch developed standards for exercising its discretion, it would be bound by those standards it had previously set.

Federal Courts accepted the principle of self-narrowing for about thirty years.  In ''[[Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc.]]'' (2001), however, the [[United States Supreme Court]], in a decision written by [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]], specifically overturned the principle of self-narrowing, arguing that "[t]he very choice of which portion of power to exercise ... would ''itself'' be an exercise of the forbidden legislative authority."  [emphasis original]  In both decisions, however, the courts ultimately upheld the grant of discretionary power, thus indicating the continued weakness of the nondelegation doctrine.

The '''Annals of Connacht''', covering the years 1224 to 1544, are drawn from a manuscript compiled in the 15th and 16th centuries by at least three scribes, all believed to be members of the [[Clan Ó Duibhgeannáin]].

The early sections, commencing with the death of King [[Cathal Crobdearg Ua Conchobair]] of Connacht, are exceptionally detailed and give a good account of Connacht affairs during the 13th and early to mid-14th century, particularly for the families of [[O'Conor]] and [[Burke (surname)|Burke]]. The accounts however become more desultory, especially for the 16th century. Nevertheless, it is an invaluable document relating much that would have otherwise remained utterly obscure or unknown in the history of Connacht, and Ireland in general.

A comparison between it and the [[Annals of Clonmacnoise]] reveal a common source, or perhaps one is a partial copy of the other.

An '''aviation museum''', '''air museum''', or '''aerospace museum''' is a [[museum]] exhibiting the [[history]] and [[cultural artifacts|artifacts]] of [[aviation]]. In addition to actual or replica [[aircraft]], exhibits can include [[photographs]], [[map]]s, [[Physical model|models]], [[dioramas]], [[clothing]] and equipment used by [[aviators]].&lt;ref name="CAM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aviation.technomuses.ca/about_us/mission_and_vision/|title = Our Mission and Vision|accessdate = 2009-01-12|last = [[Canada Aviation Museum]]|authorlink = |year = n.d.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081227034848/http://www.aviation.technomuses.ca/about_us/mission_and_vision/| archivedate= 27 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aviation museums vary in size from housing just one or two aircraft to hundreds. They may be owned by national, regional or local governments or be privately owned. Some museums address the history and artifacts of space exploration as well, illustrating the close association between [[aeronautics]] and [[astronautics]].

Many aviation museums concentrate on military or civil aviation, or on aviation history of a particular era, such as [[Aviation in the pioneer era|pioneer aviation]] or [[Aviation between the World Wars|the succeeding "golden age"]] between the World Wars, aircraft of [[World War II]] or a specific type of aviation, such as [[gliding]].&lt;ref name="CAM" /&gt;

Aviation museums may display their aircraft only on the ground or fly some of them. Museums that do not fly their aircraft may have decided not to do so either because the aircraft are not in condition to fly or because they are considered too rare or valuable. Museums may fly their aircraft in [[air show]]s or other aviation related events, accepting the risk that flying them entails.&lt;ref name="CWH"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.warplane.com/pages/aboutus.html|title = Canadian Warplane Heritage About Us|accessdate = 2009-01-12|last = [[Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum]]|authorlink = |year = n.d.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081217044426/http://www.warplane.com/pages/aboutus.html| archivedate= 17 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VWmission"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.vintagewings.ca/|title = About Vintage Wings of Canada|accessdate = 2013-03-24|last = [[Vintage Wings of Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some museums have sets of periodicals, technical manuals, photographs and personal archives. These are often made available to aviation researchers for use in writing articles or books or to aircraft restoration specialists working on restoring an aircraft.&lt;ref name="CAMHoldings"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aviation.technomuses.ca/collections/library_and_archives/holdings/|title = Library and Archives Holdings|accessdate = 2009-01-13|last = [[Canada Aviation Museum]]|authorlink = |year = n.d.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081227072447/http://www.aviation.technomuses.ca/collections/library_and_archives/holdings/| archivedate= 27 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk Royal Air Force Museum UK] Retrieved on 2013-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Blyew v. United States''''' was a case heard before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in April 1872 addressing the [[Civil rights in the United States|civil rights]] of [[African Americans]], as well as [[states' rights]] issues. The case involved the testimony of a dying man who identified his attackers and the testimony of other African American victims of an attack with an axe. [[Kentucky]] [[State law (United States)|state law]] prohibited the testimony of a "Negro" against a white man and barred African Americans from serving on juries. After the attackers were convicted in [[Federal judiciary of the United States|Federal court]], the State of Kentucky appealed the case to the Supreme Court citing States Rights in defense of its laws prohibitting African Americans from testifying against Whites. The case was a test of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]]. The Supreme Court ruled that victims were not entitled to protection from the state law because word "affected" in the law did not apply to victims of crimes who are not defendants in a case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NM_rf6TndMsC&amp;pg=PA79|title=Shades of Freedom: Racial Politics and Presumptions of the American Legal Process|first=A.

{{graph search algorithm}}

The '''British Museum algorithm''' is a general approach to find a solution by checking all possibilities one by one, beginning with the smallest. The term refers to a conceptual, not a practical, technique where the number of possibilities is enormous.

For instance, one may, in theory, find the smallest program that solves a particular problem in the following way: Generate all possible source codes of length one character. Check each one to see if it solves the problem. (Note: the [[halting problem]] makes this check troublesome, although this can be overcome with [[dovetailing (computer science)|dovetailing]].) If not, generate and check all programs of two characters, three characters, etc. Conceptually, this finds the smallest program, but in practice it tends to take an unacceptable amount of time (more than the lifetime of the universe, in many instances) {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}.

Similar arguments can be made to show that optimizations, theorem proving, language recognition, etc. are possible or impossible.

In the 1950s the Museum conceived of the design for the '''Circus Building''', completed in 1965, to meet the requirements of exhibiting the five-hundred-foot-long Roy Arnold miniature circus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/collections/detail.php?id=13&lt;/ref&gt; Traversing the grand hallway of the large horseshoe-shaped, spruce and cedar structure gives the impression of walking through the entire concourse of a circus parade. Outside, the large boulders that form the building’s foundation accentuate the structure’s dramatic shape and serve as the backdrop for the Daylily Garden, planted in 2008.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993.

==Collection==

===Carousel Figures===
Although the [[carousel]] was invented in Europe it reached its fullest development in the [[United States]] between 1870 and 1930. during this time, elaborate carousels became fixtures of the new city parks built for a public with increasing amounts of leisure time and disposable income. Hundreds of park carousels were built by highly skilled woodcarvers and painters while an even greater number of smaller, portable carousels were made for use at country fairs and carnivals.

[[Shelburne Museum]] owns examples of both types of carousels: a small, portable machine operates outside the '''Circus Building''', while the animals, chariots and painted panels from a part carousel manufactured by the [[Dentzel Carousel Company|Gustav Dentzel Company]] of [[Philadelphia]] are exhibited inside the '''Circus Building'''. Figures by a number of other manufacturers, both European and American, also are exhibited in the '''Circus building'''.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt; 

The German-born Dentzel opened America’s first carousel business in 1867. Detnzel’s shop produced the most realistic and graceful of all carousel animals; his carvers paid enormous attention to anatomical detail and his painters rendered every nuance of the animals’ coloration. [[Shelburne Museum]]’s Dentzels are from a forty-animal carousel completed about 1902. The three-row machine carried twenty-nine horses and four [[chariot]]s; menagerie figures include three [[giraffe]]s, three [[goat]]s, three [[deer]], a [[lion]] and a [[tiger]]. The figures were finish-carved by Daniel Muller, the most skilled of Dentzel’s craftspeople. All the animals are in their original factory paint; this is almost unheard of for carousel figures because most carousels were repainted frequently as part of routine maintenance. Several of the figures have recently been conserved; layers of discolored, non-original linseed oil were removed to reveal the richly colored and complex paint patterns applied by Dentzel’s masterful painters. All forty animals will eventually receive the same professional treatment. 

The small, portable carousel outside the circus building was made about 1920 by the [[Allan Herschell Company]] of [[North Tonawanda, New York]]. In 1883 herschell began producing carousels designed to endure hard wear and frequent travel. The horses were smaller and more compact than those made for permanent park carousels by such companies as Dentzel and the [[Philadelphia Toboggan Company]] heads and legs were tucked close to the bodies to minimize breakage and the machines could be easily taken apart, moved, and reassembled.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

===Circus Posters===
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[circus]] was an annual event awaited with great anticipation.  Weeks before the circus was due to arrive, colorful posters appeared on barns and fences, announcing the dates and new performers.  When the circus arrived, excitement grew as wagons, [[elephant]]s, and [[clown]]s paraded through town.

Traveling circuses are represented at the [[Shelburne Museum]] by the vintage advertising posters that line the inside wall of the '''Circus Building'''. The Museum’s collection of over five hundred circus posters is among the finest and most comprehensive in the country.  It includes many extremely rare, early posters as well as examples from all the major circuses of the Golden Age of the American traveling circus (ca. 1870-1940), including [[Barnum and Bailey]], [[Ringling Brothers]], [[Adam Forepaugh]], John B. Doris, and the Sells Brothers. The posters are typically brightly colored and attention-grabbing. Most feature dramatic new acts or exotic animals; many make outrageous (and sometimes utterly false) claims – the largest, the smallest, the most dangerous, the rarest, the one and only, etc.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

===Circus Carvings===
The Museum owns three elaborate carved miniature circuses. The Circus Parade, which runs over five hundred feet through the circus building, was begun in 1925 by Roy Arnold (1892-1976) of [[Hardwick, Vermont]]. Built on a one-inch to one-foot scale, the parade required thirty years to complete. Four other skilled woodcarvers, Harry T. Prior, Charles W. Dech, Milo Smith and Charles Lockier, worked with Arnold on the parade, which features accurate reproductions of wagons used by circuses of the Golden Age.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum's Circus Coll"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Kory|title=Shelburne Museum's Circus Collection|year=2010|publisher=Shelburne Museum|location=Shelburne, VT|isbn=9780939384365}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miniature parade is complemented by exhibits of pony-sized wagons and several life-sized figures originally carved by [[Samuel Anderson Robb]] for [[Barnum and Bailey]] tableau wagons in the 1890s. Robb is best known for his trade figures, several of which are exhibited in [[Stagecoach Inn (Vermont)|Stagecoach Inn]].

The Kirk Bros. Miniature Circus is a complete three-ringed folk art circus created by Edgar Decker Kirk (1891-1956) of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], over a period of forty-six years. Kirk, who worked as a brakeman on the Pennsylvania railroad, began the circus in 1910 when his children were small and continued to work on it long after they were grown, until 1956.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum's Circus Coll" /&gt; Working at night after twelve-hour days with the railroad, Kirk cut the figures for his circus from scrap lumber on a treadle-operated [[Scroll saw|jigsaw]] and completed the carving with an ordinary [[penknife]]. Only the nails and paint were specially purchased. The Kirk circus, complete with animals acts, clowns, trapeze artists, bands, side shows and bleachers full of spectators and vendors, is a monument to Kirk’s creativity, ingenuity and lifelong passion for the circus. 

Also in the collection are scale models of a canal boat circus. From 1882 to 1887 residents of ports along the Erie and Oswego canals of central [[New York (state)|New York]] State were visited each summer by Sig Sautelle’s big shows, one of the only circuses ever to travel by boat. Sautelle, born George Satterlee (1848–1928), was a colorful showman and one of the most successful promoters of his time. The wooden models of Sautelle’s two circus canal boats, built by Milo Smith of [[Herkimer, New York]], provide a vivid picture of this unique regional circus.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

Comparethemarket.com.au is an [[Australia|Australian]] price comparison website operated by Compare the Market Pty Ltd. It offers a service for customers to compare a range of general [[insurance]], [[health insurance]], [[life insurance]], energy and personal finance products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.choice.com.au/money/insurance/insurance-advice/articles/insurance-comparison-sites#compare | title=Insurance comparison sites | last=Bird | first=Jodi | date=19 August 2014 | website=Choice |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History in Australia ==

Comparethemarket.com.au was launched in Australia in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compare_the_Meerkat&amp;oldid=764552890 | title=Compare the Meerkat | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | date=9 February 2017 | publisher=Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; six years after the launch of [[comparethemarket.com]] in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.insurancenews.com.au/international/bgl-eyes-london-float-for-compare-the-market | title= BGL eyes London float for Compare The Market | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | date=18 July 2016 | website=insurancenews.com.au | publisher=McMullan Conway Communications Pty Ltd |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the comparethemarket.com.au service, Australian customers can compare a number of products based on price, features, and more. These products include health insurance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.marketingmag.com.au/news-c/compare-meerkats-second-best-selling-cuddly-toys-uk-2015-2016/ | title=After huge UK sales, Compare The Market meerkat toys come to Australia | last=Ice | first=Ben | date=9 February 2017 | publisher=Marketingmag.com.au | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; car insurance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/costs/compare-the-market-mainly-compares-insurance-offered-by-its-parent-company/news-story/e25c446c8a60c7291eb803eaeefd5e6b | title=Compare the Market mainly compares insurance offered by its parent company | last=Rolfe | first=John | date=1 November 2016 | publisher=News.com.au | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/ipart-says-nsw-electricity-market-working-well-as-it-urges-customers-to-switch-20160920-grk394.html | title=IPART says NSW electricity market 'working well' as it urges customers to switch | last=Han | first=Esther | date=20 September 2016 | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the company signed a deal to secure [[Bupa]], one of Australia’s largest health insurers, as a participating health fund. The deal ensured that Bupa products could be compared on comparethemarket.com.au, alongside products from health funds like ahm (owned by [[Medibank]]) and HBF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/compare-the-market-signs-bupa-deal-20150930-gjyb6b.html | title=Compare The Market signs Bupa deal | last1=Liew | first1=Ruth | last2=Binsted | first2=Tim | date=1 October 2015 | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparethemarket.com.au was the first commercial comparison website in Australia to disclose the amount of commission it receives from participating health funds. As of 2016, the standardised flat fee equated to a net present value of 27.75 percent of the first year premium of the health insurance product sold by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/compare-the-market-signs-bupa-deal-20150930-gjyb6b.html | title=Compare The Market signs Bupa deal | last1=Liew | first1=Ruth | last2=Binsted | first2=Tim | date=1 October 2015 | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparethemarket.com.au continues to compete against other comparison services in Australia, like iSelect and Choosi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.choice.com.au/money/insurance/insurance-advice/articles/insurance-comparison-sites#compare | title=Insurance comparison sites | last=Bird | first=Jodi | date=19 August 2014 | website=Choice | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meerkat Campaign ==

Compare the Market is perhaps best known for its marketing campaigns featuring meerkat characters Aleksandr Orlov and his Head of IT, Sergei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://mumbrella.com.au/compare-market-creates-first-local-meerkat-campaign-mission-impawsible-276631 | title=Compare the Market creates first local meerkat campaign with ‘Mission Impawsible’ | last=Hayes | first=Alex | date=17 February 2015 | publisher=Mumbrella | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meerkat advertisements started with Aleksandr Orlov’s mission to clear the confusion up for Australians who mistook his website comparethemeerkat.com.au for comparethemarket.com.au.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://mumbrella.com.au/compare-market-tells-story-aleksandr-olrovs-ancestors-came-russia-new-cinema-campaign-243869 | title=Compare the Market tells the story of how Aleksandr Olrov’s ancestors came to Russia in new cinema campaign | last=Ward | first=Miranda | date=11 August 2014 | publisher=Mumbrella | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same marketing campaign was launched years earlier in the United Kingdom for comparethemarket.com, which ended up topping a Nielsen consumer poll to be dubbed “UK’s most loved ad”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bandt.com.au/advertising/Comparison-site-launching-meerkat-assault-on-Sunda | title=Comparison site launching meerkat assault on Sunday | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | date=1 February 2013 | publisher=B&amp;T Magazine | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the UK business continues to use these characters in their own marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/the-simples-idea-that-became-a-16310m-empire-2119590.html | title=The 'Simples!' idea that became a £10m empire | last=Hickman | first=Martin | date=4 April 2012 | publisher=The Independent | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meerkat character, Baby Oleg, was introduced at the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://mumbrella.com.au/ad-wrap-compare-the-market-does-christmas-plus-ing-direct-nimble-bulla-and-woolworths-334410 | title=Ad wrap: Compare the Market does Christmas; plus ING Direct, Nimble, Bulla and Woolworths | last=Ward | first=Miranda | date=8 December 2015 | publisher=Mumbrella | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline continued with Aleksandr Orlov buying the Compare the Market business, and introduced a human character named Tom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://adstandards.com.au/cases/2016/March?ref=0119/16 | title=Case Report, Number 0119/16 | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | date=8 December 2015 | publisher=Advertising Standards Board | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the company launched a limited run of meerkat toys for their health insurance customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bandt.com.au/advertising/meerkat-celebrities-aleksandr-sergei-make-way | title= Meerkat Celebrities Aleksandr And Sergei Make Their Way Down Under | last=McGuire | first=Neneh | date=13 February 2017 | publisher=B&amp;T Magazine | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://mumbrella.com.au/compare-the-markets-aleksandr-the-meerkat-and-sergei-arrive-as-toys-in-australia-425485 | title=Compare the Market’s Aleksandr the Meerkat and Sergei arrive as toys in Australia | last=Samios | first=Zoe | date=10 February 2017 | publisher=Mumbrella | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleksandr’s catchphrase, “simples”, is so well known that it can be found in both the Macmillan English dictionary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/video-advertising/meerkat-mission | title=Meerkat mission: campaign that broke the online ad barrier | last=Biddiscombe | first=Ross | date=20 February 2010 | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bandt.com.au/advertising/meerkat-celebrities-aleksandr-sergei-make-way | title= Meerkat Celebrities Aleksandr And Sergei Make Their Way Down Under | last=McGuire | first=Neneh | date=13 February 2017 | publisher=B&amp;T Magazine | accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19318">This is a '''comparison of online music storage services''' (Cloud Music Services), Internet services that allow uploads of personally owned or licensed music to the [[Cloud storage|cloud]] for listening on multiple devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifehacker.com/5812138/cloud-music-comparison-whats-the-best-service-for-streaming-your-library-everywhere Cloud Music Comparison: What’s the Best Service for Streaming Your Library Everywhere?], [[Lifehacker]], 15 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three large services—[[Amazon Music]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iTunes Match]], and [[Google Play Music]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcworld.com/article/244102/google_music_itunes_match_and_amazon_cloud_drive_digital_music_services_comparison.html Google Music, iTunes Match, and Amazon Cloud Drive: Digital Music Services Comparison], [[PC World]], 17 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;—each incorporating an [[online music store]] (see [[comparison of online music stores|comparison]]), with purchased songs from the associated music store not counting toward storage limits.  Other than additional storage space, the main additional feature provided with an annual fee by Apple (and formerly [[Amazon.com]]) is "scan-and-match", which examines music files on a computer and adds a copy of matched tracks to the user's music locker without having to upload the files. [[Google]] provides both a large amount of storage space and the scan-and-match feature at no cost.

Amazon was the first of the currently significant players to launch their cloud music locker service in late March 2011 and the first to discontinue it on 30 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/amazon-music-to-end-support-for-streaming-your-uploaded-mp3s/ Amazon Music to end support for streaming your uploaded MP3s]&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon Music launched without obtaining any new music streaming licenses, which upset the major record labels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/29/us-amazon-idUSTRE72S13H20110329 Amazon faces backlash over "music locker" service], [[Reuters]], Phil Wahba and Paul Thomasch, Mar 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Google launched their service less than a month and a half later, also without obtaining any new licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/07/are-google-music-and-amazon-cloud-player-illegal/ Unlicensed: Are Google Music and Amazon Cloud Player illegal?], [[Ars Technica]], July 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Apple negotiated with the major record labels for a new license before launching their service six months after Google's. Amazon and Google eventually negotiated licenses before launching their scan-and-match features.

For streaming services where a person is unable to upload their own music, but is limited to music provided by the service, such as [[Pandora Radio]] and [[Spotify]], see [[Comparison of on-demand streaming music services]].  See that article also for information on subscription streaming services provided by four of the companies below (Google Play Music All Access, Apple's [[Apple Music]], Amazon's Prime Music, and Microsoft's Groove Music Pass).

== Comparison ==

Major differences between the services are Google offering scan-and-match and a large amount of storage as no-cost features, whereas others usually offer limited or no storage space for free and scan and match only with an annual fee.  For users with extremely large libraries, Amazon offers the most storage space for a reasonable annual fee.

Amazon did not allow [[podcast]]s, ringtones, or [[audiobook]]s to be uploaded.&lt;ref name="AmazonImporting"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=200593730 Importing Music into Cloud Player], Amazon Help&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/01/throwdown-itunes-match-vs-amazon-cloud-player-vs-google-music/2/ Google Music and Amazon Cloud Player take on iTunes Match.

'''Cross v Aurora Group Ltd''' (1989) 4 NZCLC 64,909 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the Contracts (Privity) Act 1982 and pre-incorporation contracts.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |isbn=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1987, Peter Cross negotiated a contract for property management services to Aurora Group, and planned to use a company structure for the contract.

The contract stated that it was "Cross Property Management Limited a company currently being formed", and soon after. Cross's lawyers changed a name of a holding company named Felstead limited, to Cross Property Management Limited.

Later, when the new company tried to ratify the contract, Aurora refused to accept it, and as a result CPM sued to enforce the contract.

==Held==
CPM's claim failed. Wylie J stated "Designation is a strong word, a positive word and means something more than a mere contemplation or possibility".

'''Donald Muraco''' (born September 10, 1949) is an American retired [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He is best known for his appearances with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] from 1981 to 1988, where he held the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] on [[List of WWE Intercontinental Champions|two occasions]] and was crowned the inaugural [[King of the Ring]] in 1985. Muraco was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|class of 2004]] and the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum|Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Legends|last=Solomon|first=Brian|pages=214–218|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7434-9033-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WWEBio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/donmuraco|title=Don Muraco|publisher=[[WWE]]|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2014/03/28/21564311.html|title=Don Muraco surfs a wave into Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame|publisher=[[Quebecor Media]]|work=[[Canoe.ca]]|author=Ward, Marshall|accessdate=December 20, 2015|date=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1970–1981)===
Muraco was born at Sunset Beach, Oahu, Hawaii in 1949 of [[Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiian]] heritage.&lt;ref name=owow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/d/don-muraco.html|title=Don Muraco's profile|publisher=Online World Of Wrestling|accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt; A Hawaii state amateur wrestling champion in 1967,&lt;ref name=sportshigh&gt;[http://www.sportshigh.com/attachment/CCCC65E63273D93F20020616205425639268000000/2007_Wrestling_Packet_0213.pdf SportsHigh.com]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 2008-9-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Muraco chose professional wrestling over [[American football|football]]. He spent the first year of his career learning the ropes in [[Vancouver]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Florida]] and [[Los Angeles]] before getting his first big break, for [[Verne Gagne]]'s [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA).&lt;ref name=kayfabememories&gt;Don's actual height was 6 feet tall and he weighed in around 255 pounds.[http://www.kayfabememories.com/TapeReviews/shootinterviews/donmuraco.htm Kayfabe Memories.] Retrieved on 2008-9-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestling as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]], he often [[tag team]]ed with [[Jimmy Snuka]], against wrestlers such as [[Larry Hennig]], [[Ivan Koloff]] and [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]].&lt;ref name=slam&gt;[http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/ResultsArchive/Wrestlers/muraco-don.html SLAM! Wrestling - Don Muraco Results Archive.] Retrieved on 2008-9-29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, tired of life in [[Minneapolis]], he left the AWA for Roy Shire's [[San Francisco]] [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] territory.&lt;ref name=kayfabememories/&gt;

In 1974, Muraco moved to [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] (CWF). He was frequently compared to the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Champion]] [[Jack Brisco]], whom he physically resembled.&lt;ref name=kayfabememories/&gt; In a match between the two on May 28, 1974, Muraco reversed Brisco's finishing move, the [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|figure four leglock]]. Though Muraco lost the match by disqualification, this feat made him a star.&lt;ref name=cwfmemories&gt;[http://www.wrestlingonline.com/cwfmemories/htm/fanpage.htm WrestlingOnline.com - CWF Memories.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009222352/http://www.wrestlingonline.com/cwfmemories/htm/fanpage.htm |date=October 9, 2008 }} Retrieved on 2008-9-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

After brief stints in [[Texas]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Muraco returned to California in 1975 and won his first singles title, the [[NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship]]. He then won the San Francisco version of the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (San Francisco version)|NWA World Tag Team Championship]] with Masked Invader #1. In San Francisco, Muraco learned to work as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]].&lt;ref name=wrestlibrary&gt;[http://wrestlibrary.250free.com/Magnificent_Muraco.html Wrestlibrary - Don Muraco.] Retrieved on 2008-9-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1977 through 1981, Muraco shuttled several more times between Florida, San Francisco and his native Hawaii. In Florida, he was involved in two high-profile [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angles]]. In 1979, a masked villain called "The Magnificent M" appeared in the territory. Though it came as little surprise when he was eventually unmasked as Muraco, his bald head shocked the audience.&lt;ref name=kayfabe2&gt;[http://www.kayfabememories.com/TapeReviews/shootinterviews/donmuraco-2.htm KayFabe Memories p2.] Retrieved on 2008-9-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1980, he [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with [[Barry Windham]], in which the bigger and more experienced Muraco [[piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledrove]] the rookie on the concrete floor.&lt;ref name=wrestlibrary/&gt; Windham eventually got his revenge, in the process becoming a credible wrestler in the eyes of the fans.&lt;ref name=cwfarchives&gt;[http://www.cwfarchives.com/articles/25Angles.php CWF Archives - 25 Greatest Angles.] Retrieved on 2008-9-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Wrestling Federation (1981–1984, 1985–1988)===

====Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion (1981–1984)====
In 1981, Muraco debuted in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), where he would have his greatest success. Managed by [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]], he captured the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] on June 20, 1981, from [[Pedro Morales]]. He lost it to Morales on November 23 in a Texas Death match, capping a bloody feud. That year, Muraco wrestled then [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bob Backlund]] several times, including a 60-minute draw on October 24.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&amp;wrestler=305&amp;bild=1&amp;details=7&amp;liga=3&amp;jahr=1981&amp;seite=3 Muraco's 1981 WWF matches, from WrestlingData.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He split 1982 between [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] (where he partnered with [[Roddy Piper]] for a time), [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (where he also wrestled under a mask as Dr. X) and [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (where he wrestled in the annual [[Madison Square Garden|MSG]] League tournament), before returning to the WWF that fall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&amp;wrestler=305&amp;bild=1&amp;details=7 Places Don Muraco has wrestled, from WrestlingData.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Now managed by [[Lou Albano|Captain Lou Albano]], Muraco regained the Intercontinental title from Morales on January 22, 1983. That year, Muraco feuded with Albano's former protégé, [[Jimmy Snuka]]. The feud culminated on October 17, in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]] at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Snuka lost the match, but afterward dragged Muraco back into the ring and hit his finisher, the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|Superfly Splash]], from the top of the 15-foot cage. In the crowd at the Garden for this match was future WWE Hall of Famer [[Mick Foley]].

During his two Intercontinental title reigns, Muraco had bloody feuds with [[Bob Backlund]], [[Tony Atlas]] and [[Rocky Johnson]]. He portrayed an arrogant villain who angrily demanded respect, while engaging in disrespectful behaviour himself; in one match, he brought a [[submarine sandwich]] to the ring and ate it while dominating his outmatched opponent. Later, he would preface his matches by dedicating his impending finishing move, the piledriver, to either the heel commentator or whomever he was feuding with at the time. Audiences regularly mocked Muraco and his Hawaiian origins with derisive chants of "beach bum".

On February 11, 1984, Muraco lost the Intercontinental title to [[Tito Santana]]. After a series of unsuccessful rematches, Muraco took a hiatus from wrestling in August 1984.

====Alliance with Mr. Fuji (1985–1987)====
Muraco returned to the WWF in 1985, managed by [[Mr. Fuji]]. After not wrestling on the card of the first [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]], Muraco headlined three consecutive [[Madison Square Garden]] cards against WWF World Heavyweight Champion [[Hulk Hogan]], climaxing in a bloody steel cage match on June 21, which Hogan won. On July 8, Muraco won the first [[King of the Ring]] tournament when he pinned [[The Iron Sheik]] in the Final. Before defeating the Sheik, Muraco had defeated the [[Junkyard Dog]], [[Les Thornton]] and Pedro Morales to reach the Final.

In addition to feuding with [[Ricky Steamboat]] for much of the remainder of the year which included hanging Steamboat from the top rope with Steamboat's own karate belt on an episode of ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling]]'', Fuji and Muraco debuted ''Fuji Vice'', a series of skits parodying [[Miami Vice]], on ''[[Tuesday Night Titans]]'' (''Fuji General'', a parody of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] soap ''[[General Hospital]]'', followed soon after).
 
In 1986, Muraco allied with [[Adrian Adonis]] and [[Bob Orton, Jr.]] in their feud with Roddy Piper. This led to Orton and Muraco becoming a regular tag team. In March 1987 they lost to the [[Can-Am Connection]] ([[Tom Zenk]] and [[Rick Martel]]) in the opening match of [[Wrestlemania III]] in front of a reported 93,173 fans at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]]. July 1987, a falling out between Muraco and Orton led to a feud between them and a face turn for Muraco. Muraco won almost every match in the feud, on TV and at house shows, until Orton left the WWF that year.

===="The Rock" (1987–1988)====
In a TV taping aired in November 1987, Muraco solidified his face status by saving [[Superstar Billy Graham]] from a three-on-one beating by [[Butch Reed]], [[One Man Gang]] and [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]], and taking Graham as his new manager. Muraco adopted Graham's [[tie-dye]] attire and changed his nickname from "Magnificent Muraco" to "The Rock" (although announcer Gorilla Monsoon continued to refer to Muraco by his previous nickname). Muraco replaced Graham on the team led by his former rival [[Hulk Hogan]] at the [[Survivor Series (1987)|first Survivor Series]] and reached the quarterfinals of the WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament at [[WrestleMania IV]]. In his final months with the WWF, he feuded with [[Greg Valentine]] and lost to [[Dino Bravo]] at the [[SummerSlam (1988)|inaugural SummerSlam]]. Muraco left the WWF in late 1988.

===Various promotions (1988–1995)===
After leaving the WWF, Muraco split his time between [[Stampede Wrestling]] (where he defeated [[Mike Shaw|Makhan Singh]] to win the North American Heavyweight title), the AWA (where he wrestled [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Larry Zbyszko]] to a double disqualification) and Herb Abrams' [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|UWF]] (where he feuded with [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]]).

Muraco won the [[ECW Championship]] twice, before the promotion was renamed Extreme Championship Wrestling. During his time there, he rekindled old feuds with Jimmy Snuka and Tito Santana.

===Wrestle Association R (1994)===
Muraco, as Aka Oni, debuted for [[Wrestle Association R]] (WAR) on August 25, 1994, defeating [[Takashi Ishikawa]]. He had twelve more matches with the promotion, culminating in a tag loss (with Ai Oni) to [[Animal Hamaguchi]] and [[Ryuma Go]] on December 4, at WAR Mega Power in [[Sumo Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profightdb.com/wrestlers/don-muraco-32.html?prom_id=92 Don Muraco's WAR matches, from the Internet Wrestling Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement (1995–present)===
After retiring from the ring in 1995, Muraco returned to Hawaii. In 2003, he co-founded Hawai'i Championship Wrestling with local TV producer Linda Bade, which ran from 2003 to 2008. He was the storyline commissioner of Hawai'i Championship Wrestling until 2006. He also worked as a [[Stevedore|longshoreman]].&lt;ref name=slaminduction&gt;[http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/03/02/367790.html SLAM! Wrestling - Muraco, Santana, Proud to be honoured] Retrieved on 2008-9-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Muraco was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|class of 2004]] by [[Mick Foley]], who, like [[Tommy Dreamer]], [[Mark LoMonaco|Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[Devon Hughes|D-Von Dudley]], credits the 1983 steel cage match between Muraco and Snuka at [[Madison Square Garden]] (which he attended) as his inspiration for becoming a wrestler.&lt;ref name=haveaniceday&gt;{{cite book|title=Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|last=Foley|first=Mick|page=34|publisher=[[ReganBooks]]|year=1999|isbn=978-0-06-039299-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He managed his son, Joe, in [[World Xtreme Wrestling|WXW]]. On August 27, 2005, he teamed with Joe to defeat another father and son team, [[Bob Armstrong (wrestler)|Bob]] and [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]], at [[WrestleReunion#WrestleReunion 2|WrestleReunion 2]].

In 2007, Muraco inducted his former manager, Mr. Fuji, into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2007)|class of 2007]].

Muraco currently resides in Hawaii with his wife Sharon. He has three children.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

'''Earl Alexander Powell III''' (born October 24, 1943),&lt;ref name="NGAPress"&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/press/bios/powell_cv.shtm "Earl A. Powell III." Online Press Kit. National Gallery of Art. 2012.] Accessed 2012-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; nicknamed '''Rusty Powell''', is an American [[Art history|art historian]] and museum director. From 1980 to 1992, he was Director of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].  He was appointed Director of the [[National Gallery of Art]]  in [[Washington, D.C.]], in September 1992. He was appointed to the [[U.S. Commission of Fine Arts]] in 2003 and elected chairman in 2005. He was appointed to a second four-year term on August 30, 2012, and continues to serve as chairman.

==Early life==
Earl Powell was born in October 1943 in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]], to Earl Alexander Powell II and Elizabeth Duckworth Powell.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/powelle.htm "Powell, Earl &amp;#91;Alexander&amp;#93;, III, 'Rusty'." Dictionary of Art Historians. No date.] Accessed 2012-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather operated a [[photoengraving]] business, which Powell credits as influential in sparking his later love of art.&lt;ref name="Tanguy"&gt;Tanguy, Sarah. "Glittering Conversation About the World of Art." ''Washington Times.'' March 30, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The Powells moved to [[Rhode Island]]. "Rusty", as Powell was known, graduated from [[Providence Country Day School]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="Siclen"&gt;Van Siclen, Bill. "Forging Another Link in the R.I. Art Connection." ''Providence Journal.'' May 10, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a standout football player in high school.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, William. "LACMA at a Turning Point." ''Los Angeles Times.'' August 5, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell graduated from [[Williams College]] in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]] with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[art history]] and [[European history]] (with honors) in 1966.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Siclen" /&gt; He was a [[Pre-medical|pre-med]] major, but barely passed his introductory chemistry class.&lt;ref name="Dob"&gt;Dobrzynski, Judith H. "An Art Lover Who Awakened a Generation." ''New York Times.'' October 28, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Powell switched to art history, and studied under the legendary art history professors [[S. Lane Faison|S. Lane Faison, Jr.]],&lt;ref name="Dob" /&gt; [[Whitney Stoddard]],&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ken. "Whitney Stoddard, 90, Art Historian and Teacher." ''New York Times.'' April 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Pierson, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, William. "William H. Pierson Jr., 97, Art Historian." ''New York Times.'' December 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] in 1966, winning a spot in the [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Navy)|Navy Officer Candidate School]].&lt;ref name="Siclen" /&gt; His active duty service, which lasted until 1969,&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt; included a tour of duty in [[Vietnam]] as a navigator during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name="Siclen" /&gt; He left active duty service and entered the [[United States Navy Reserve]], serving until 1980.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanguy" /&gt;

After leaving the Navy, Powell considered becoming an architect. His old professor, S. Lane Faison, strongly discouraged him.  As Powell later, recalled, Faison said, "That's stupid. You should go into art history. It's the only thing you were ever good at."&lt;ref name="Dob" /&gt; Powell enrolled at [[Harvard University]], where he obtained a [[Master of Arts]] from the [[Fogg Museum]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt; He entered the doctoral program in art history at Harvard in 1970. While working on his degree, he served as a [[teaching fellow]]. Powell's [[dissertation]] was on the work of the early American painter [[Thomas Cole]], and he received his doctorate in 19th-century American and European art history in 1974.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muchnic, Suzanne. "2 L.A. Museum Directors On National Gallery List." ''Los Angeles Times.'' April 2, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year he received his Ph.D., Powell took a position as assistant professor of art history at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref name="ObamaAnnounces"&gt;"President Obama Announces More Key Administration Posts." Press release. Office of the President. The White House. August 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Powell left the University of Texas to take a position as a curator at the National Gallery of Art (NGA).&lt;ref name="ObamaAnnounces" /&gt; The NGA's director at the time, [[J. Carter Brown]], recruited Powell away from teaching. "I first spotted (Powell) in Austin, Texas. It occurred to me that he had rare potential, someone who had a passion for art, but yet had his feet on the ground. He was a people person, yet he could also handle the administrative details...," Brown later said.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;Marshall, Matthew. "Bittersweet Time for Museum Head." ''Los Angeles Times.'' October 2, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Powell stayed at the NGA for four years, rising to the position of executive curator in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, Paul. "The Big Shoes of J. Carter Brown." ''Washington Post.'' February 2, 1992; Richardson, Lynda. "Chronicle." ''New York Times.'' October 2, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown later said, "Rusty was my right hand for years".&lt;ref name="VogelAppoints"&gt;Vogel, Carol. "National Gallery Appoints Director to Succeed Brown." ''New York Times.'' April 29, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as curator, Powell organized some of the NGA's biggest exhibitions, including "The Splendor of Dresden: Five Centuries of Art Collecting" in 1978 and "American Light: The Luminist Movement" in 1980.&lt;ref name="Siclen" /&gt;

==LACMA directorship==
In January 1980, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) hired Powell to be its director.&lt;ref&gt;"Los Angeles Art Museum Names Its New Director." ''Christian Science Monitor.'' January 23, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell's tenure at LACMA was an outstanding one. In his first six years, he doubled the exhibition space by opening the Robert O. Anderson Building and the Pavilion for Japanese Art to house a rare collection of Japanese art.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, Judith. "Cultural Boom Stirring in Southern California." ''New York Times.'' October 30, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; He also oversaw the opening of the museum's new outdoor [[sculpture garden]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Muchnic, Suzanne. "LACMA Opens Sculpture Garden." ''Los Angeles Times.'' July 27, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell was also a successful fund-raiser for the museum. In his first eight years, he reached his fund-raising goal of $80 million.&lt;ref&gt;Voland, John. "Morning Report: First Off..." ''Los Angeles Times.'' July 21, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, publisher [[Walter Annenberg]] donated $10 million to the museum, the largest cash donation in its history.&lt;ref&gt;Muchnic, Suzanne. "Annenberg to Give L.A. Art Museum $10 Million." ''Los Angeles Times.'' March 14, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; During Powell's tenure, the LACMA endowment also rose to $21 million from $3 million.&lt;ref&gt;Muchnic, Suzanne. "Art Museum Study Reveals Trouble in Raising Money." ''Los Angeles Times.'' July 30, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Carter Brown later described Powell's tenure as director of LACMA as one "bound for glory".&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;

==National Gallery of Art==
On January 24, 1992, J. Carter Brown announced that he was retiring as director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Carol. "Head of National Gallery Is Retiring." ''New York Times.'' January 25, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; After a nationwide search, Earl A. Powell III was named director of the National Gallery of Art. He was only the fourth director in the museum's history.&lt;ref name="VogelAppoints" /&gt; He assumed the directorship on September 1, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Carol. "The Art Market." ''New York Times.'' June 19, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was appointed, Powell said that he believed the era of "blockbuster" exhibitions was ending, and that his focus would be to utilize the NGA's permanent collection. "I don't see the future for these massive international loan exhibitions," he said. "I would prefer to use the gallery's permanent collections in new and innovative ways."&lt;ref name="VogelAppoints" /&gt;

[[File:The Holy Family on the Steps.jpg|thumb|''The Holy Family on the Steps'', which the NGA learned during Powell's tenure was not by Nicolas Poussin.]]
During the beginning of Powell's tenure at the NGA, he faced several challenges. In May 1994, the NGA learned that its painting, ''The Holy Family on the Steps'', was a forgery and not the work of 17th-century French painter [[Nicolas Poussin]]. Powell was  criticized for not ordering the relabeling of the painting in a timely manner, and for mishandling the NGA's response to its critics.&lt;ref&gt;"Truth in Labeling." ''Washington Post.'' November 13, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1994, D.C. television station [[WJLA-TV|WJLA]] ran a three-part exposé titled "Gallery of Shame", in which the station revealed the content of a confidential report that criticized the NGA for severe lapses in maintenance, environmental control, and art storage. The report said that these conditions "threaten[ed] the security of the collection" and placed works of art "at risk" of "serious damage."&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis, Jo Ann. "Gallery Weathers the Storm." ''Washington Post.'' December 3, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VogelShame"&gt;Vogel, Carol. "Inside Art." ''New York Times.'' December 9, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The report documented a leaky roof, dripping skylights, flooded storerooms, and burst radiators that poured clouds of steam into galleries. In one case, a poorly maintained [[humidifier]] turned the varnish on [[John Singleton Copley]]'s ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' an opaque white.&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VogelShame" /&gt; (The painting was restored with no damage.)  The report also criticized the management structure at the museum, documented low employee morale, and uncovered poor minority hiring practices.&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; Powell attacked WJLA's report as "hyperbole and exaggeration", and said that not a single work of art had been damaged.&lt;ref name="VogelShame" /&gt; He also said that the NGA had been aware of the problems for several years,&lt;ref name="VogelShame" /&gt; and that he already had a plan in place to implement the consultants' recommendations within 12 months.&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt;

Powell has also had numerous and notable successes as NGA director. In 1995, the museum mounted the first comprehensive retrospective of the work of American painter [[Winslow Homer]] in 25 years. It also hosted an exhibit of nearly all the works of 17th century [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Johannes Vermeer]]. The Vermeer exhibit was shuttered three times in November and December 1995 when the [[United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996|federal government shut down]] after President [[Bill Clinton]] and the [[United States Congress]] were unable to reach agreement on a federal budget.&lt;ref&gt;Weinraub, Judith. "A Bleak Picture of the Shutdown." ''Washington Post.'' December 22, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Powell ordered that $30,000 from the NGA's Fund for International Exchange  be used to reopen the Vermeer exhibit (but no other parts of the National Gallery of Art) for one week.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Jo Ann and Parker, Lonnae O'Neal. "A Dutch Treat: Vermeer Show to Reopen." ''Washington Post.'' December 27, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Powell presided over the ground-breaking for the [[National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Carl. "Sculpture Garden to Surround Skating Rink on Washington's Mall." ''Associated Press.'' June 13, 1997; Shaw-Eagle, Joanna. "National Gallery Breaks Ground for Sculpture Garden." ''Washington Times.'' June 13, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other posts, writing, and honors==
In June 2002, President [[George W. Bush]] nominated and the [[United States Senate]] approved Powell for a position as a member of the National Council on the Arts, an advisory panel for the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]. Powell filled an unexpired six-year term which would end on September 3, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Dutka, Elaine. "Arts and Entertainment Reports." ''Los Angeles Times.'' June 14, 2002; Donadio, Rachel. "In Brief." ''New York Sun.'' April 11, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; But Powell resigned the position in late 2003.&lt;ref&gt;"Personnel Announcement." Press release. Office of the President. The White House. January 7, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Childs Resigns as Head of Fine Arts Panel." ''Washington Post.'' May 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; His fellow commissioners elected Powell chairman of the CFA. During his tenure as chairman of the CFA, Powell and the CFA provided input and advice for the ''Monumental Core Framework Plan'', a 2006 study by the [[National Capital Planning Commission]] which made recommendations regarding land use, transportation, and urban design in areas around the [[National Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Arlo. "Planners See Ideas Beyond the Mall." ''Washington Times.'' May 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush reappointed Powell to the CFA in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Ruane, Michael E. "District Briefing." ''Washington Post.'' May 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Again he was elected chairman. During his second term, Powell led the CFA in participating in the study and review of the ''Final National Mall Plan / Environmental Impact Statement''—a 2010 plan by the [[National Park Service]] to craft a vision and planning document to guide the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., for the next 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;Ruane, Michael E. "Fine-Arts Panel Enthusiastic About Plan to Overhaul the Mall." ''Washington Post.'' February 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] appointed Powell to a second full four-year term on the CFA in August 2012.&lt;ref name="ObamaAnnounces" /&gt; Once more, Powell continued as chairman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2930">'''ISAE 3402''' is an [[Assurance services|assurance standard]]. The title is "Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization". It was published in June 2011 as a standard for documenting that a service organisation has adequate [[internal controls]]; the approach is always from a financial reporting perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Third party assurance (e.g. ISAE 3402)|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/be/en/pages/risk/solutions/third-party-assurance.html|publisher=Deloitte|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISAE 3402 Type II Service Organization Control - SOC Reporting|url=http://www.rackspace.co.uk/certifications/isae-3402-type-ii-service-organization-control-soc2-reporting|publisher=Rackspace|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;for all other purposes one would use a ISAE 3000. In SOC terms, an ISAE 3402 is a SOC1. ISAE stands for "International Standard for Assurance Engagements".

Like [[SAS 70]] and [[SSAE 16]], ISAE 3402 prescribes Service Organization Control reports, which help give assurance to the organisation's customers and service users, who may have their own assurance needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISAE 3402 Services|url=https://a-lign.com/compliance/isae-3402/|publisher=A-LIGN|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two kinds of ISAE 3402 reports:
* Type I: Documenting a "snapshot" of the organisation's controls
* Type II: Documenting over a period of time (typically 6 months) showing controls have been managed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Service organization control (SOC) reports|url=http://isae3402.com/ISAE3402_reports.html|publisher=isae3402.com|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISAE 3402 was developed by the [[IAASB]] ([[International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board]]), but it is also supported by the IFAC ([[International Federation of Accountants]]). It supersedes [[SAS 70]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISAE 3402|url=https://www.unicc.org/Pages/OurAdvantages/ISAE3402.aspx|publisher=ICC|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and puts more emphasis on procedures for the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of controls.

'''''Kafka's Soup''''' is a literary [[Genre parodies|pastiche]] in the form of a [[cookbook]].&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; It contains 14 recipes&lt;ref name=Note/&gt; each written in the style of a famous author from history. As of 2007 it had been translated into 18 languages&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; and published in 27 countries.&lt;ref name=Age/&gt; Excerpts from the book have appeared in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''&lt;ref name=Herald/&gt; and the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=NewYork/&gt; Theatrical performances of the recipes have taken place in France and Canada.

==Recipes==
Recipes include: [[tiramisu]] as made by [[Proust]],&lt;ref name=Age/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marianne/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent1/&gt; [[cheese on toast]] by [[Harold Pinter]],&lt;ref name=Herald/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; [[clafoutis]] grandmere by [[Virginia Woolf]],&lt;ref name=Herald/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph1/&gt; [[chocolate cake]] prepared by [[Irvine Welsh]],&lt;ref name=Independent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph1/&gt; lamb with dill sauce by [[Raymond Chandler]],&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph1/&gt; onion tart by [[Chaucer]],&lt;ref name=Age/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph1/&gt; [[fenkata]] ([[rabbit stew]]) by [[Homer]],&lt;ref name=Age/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent1/&gt; boned stuffed [[Poussin (chicken)|poussins]] by the [[Marquis de Sade]],&lt;ref name=Marianne/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph1/&gt; mushroom [[risotto]] by [[John Steinbeck]],&lt;ref name=Independent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph1/&gt; tarragon eggs by [[Jane Austen]],&lt;ref name=Age/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent1/&gt; Vietnamese chicken by [[Graham Greene]]&lt;ref name=Independent1/&gt; and [[Kafka]]'s [[Miso soup]].&lt;ref name=Age/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marianne/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph1/&gt; Also included are recipes in the style of [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Gabriel García Márquez]].&lt;ref name=Independent1/&gt;

Among the recipes that did not make the original edition of the book was "[[plum pudding]] à la [[Charles Dickens]]" which was written but rejected by Mark Crick for being "too long-winded".&lt;ref name=Telegraph1/&gt; It was, however, included in a subsequent paperback edition of the book&lt;ref name=Age/&gt; along with two recipes, [[Rösti]] à la [[Thomas Mann]] and [[moules marinieres]] à la [[Italo Calvino]], originally created for the German and Italian translations respectively.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;

''Kafka's Soup'' is illustrated with paintings by the author in the style of a number of famous artists including [[Picasso]], [[Matisse]], [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[De Chirico]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Egon Schiele]] and [[Warhol]].&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph1/&gt;

''Kafka's Soup'' is Mark Crick's first book.&lt;ref name=Age/&gt; He has subsequently written two other books with similar themes; ''[[Sartre's Sink]]'' and ''Machiavelli's Lawn'' which are literary pastiches in the form of a DIY handbook and a gardening book respectively.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

==Writing ''Kafka's Soup''==
The idea for ''Kafka's Soup'' arose during a conversation between Crick and a publisher.&lt;ref name=Age/&gt; Crick noted his dislike for cookbooks&lt;ref name=Telegraph1/&gt; saying that he enjoyed looking at the pictures but found the accompanying text dull.&lt;ref name=Age/&gt; When asked what would it take for him to read beyond the ingredients list he replied "if [the text] was written by the world's greatest authors."&lt;ref name=Age/&gt; The publisher liked the idea and, in Crick's words, "she said that if I wrote it she'd publish it."&lt;ref name=Age/&gt;

Most of the recipes in the book are Crick's own, although some, such as the chocolate cake, came from his friends.&lt;ref name=Publishers/&gt; Crick notes the implausibility of some of his authors cooking their stated dishes (for example he states that John Steinbeck "would never have eaten [mushroom risotto]"&lt;ref name=Telegraph1/&gt; and "I certainly accept any challenge that Kafka would not have eaten miso soup"&lt;ref name=Publishers/&gt;). He says that he selected the recipes based on the ability of each dish to allow him to use the language he wished to use.&lt;ref name=Publishers/&gt; Chocolate cake was selected for Irvine Welsh because "people become terribly selfish when there's chocolate cake around, just as they do with drugs. It's the closest many get to taking heroin."&lt;ref name=Telegraph1/&gt;

Crick says that he found Virginia Woolf the most difficult of the authors to write&lt;ref name=Telegraph1/&gt; while Raymond Chandler was the easiest.&lt;ref name=Surrey/&gt;

==Response==
''Kafka's Soup'' has become a cult hit.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; Andy Miller of the ''Telegraph'' called the recipes "note-perfect parodies of literary greats".&lt;ref name=Telegraph2/&gt; Emily Stokes of the ''Observer'' called it an "illustrated masterpiece of pastiche" citing the lamb with dill sauce as "particularly good".&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;  C J Schüler wrote that Virginia Woolf's clafoutis grandmere is the "pièce de resistance" and called the collection "irresistibly moreish".&lt;ref name=Independent1/&gt; He later called the book "a little gem of literary impersonation".&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; Schüler believes that "part of the book's appeal lies in the fact that the recipes...actually work."&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; The French writer and satirist [[Patrick Rambaud]] has named ''Kafka's soup'' as one of his favourite parodies, noting the inclusion of parodies of continental European authors such as Proust and the Marquis de Sade in addition to English-speaking authors.&lt;ref name=Marianne/&gt;Some have noticed the similarity with the story written by Frederic Grimani Fiegenwald Coy, one year earlier: https://storywrite.com/story/7598601-what-would-franz-kafka-say-if-you-knock-on-his-toilet-door--by-sexy

As of 2007 ''Kafka's Soup'' had been translated into 18 languages&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; and published in 27 countries.&lt;ref name=Age/&gt; The Croatian translation proved more popular than ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', forcing it in to second place on the country's best seller list.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; Each recipe in the French version was translated by a separate translator specialising in the translation of the works of the parodied author.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;

==Theatrical readings==
In England, the recipes have reportedly been used as audition pieces by a small [[West Country]] theatre company.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; The [[Théâtre de l'Atelier]] in Paris hosted a performance of the French translation of the book in 2007. The production included performances by [[Irène Jacob]], [[Isabelle Carré]] and [[Denis Podalydès]], including a sung version of the recipe for onion tart.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; A live reading of the French translation of ''Kafka's Soup'' took place at the Montreal [[Festival International de la Littérature]] in 2007 with the author in attendance.&lt;ref name=Montreal/&gt; The production received an additional performance run in the [[Terrebonne, Quebec|Terrebonne]] suburb of Montreal in 2009.&lt;ref name=Voir/&gt;

[[File:2017 klexikon lesezeichen.jpg|thumb|The Klexikon logo displays an owl as a symbol of wisdom and knowledge.]]

'''Klexikon''' is a German online encyclopedia for children aged six to twelve years. It was launched in December 2014. The name ''Klexikon'' is a [[portmanteau]] combining the two German words ''Kinder'' [children] and ''Lexikon'' [encyclopedia] Like its role model Wikipedia, the site was created as a [[wiki]] using the [[MediaWiki]] software. The text content is available under a [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons By Attribution Share-alike]] version 3.0 licence while free media is taken from [[Wikimedia Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://klexikon.zum.de/wiki/Hilfe:In_English |title=In English |work=Klexikon |date=5 July 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://klexikon.zum.de/wiki/Hilfe:Freies_Wissen |title=Freies Wissen |language=German |work=Klexikon |date=1 September 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special rules were implemented to ensure that all content is suitable for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://klexikon.zum.de/wiki/Hilfe:Grundregeln |title=Grundregeln |language=German |work=Klexikon |date=22 July 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, all editors are required to register with an email address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://klexikon.zum.de/wiki/Hilfe:Mitmachen |title=Grundregeln |language=German |work=Klexikon |date=22 July 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Klexikon encyclopedia was founded by journalist Michael Schulte and historian Ziko van Dijk, who was the chairman of [[Wikimedia Nederland|Wikimedia Netherlands]] from 2011 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geo.de/geolino/mensch/1175-rtkl-interview-klexikonde-wikipedia-fuer-kinder |title=Klexikon.de - Wikipedia für Kinder |language=German |work=[[GEO (magazine)|GEOlino]] |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is owned by non-profit association ''Zentrale für Unterrichtsmedien im Internet'' [online educational media centre] which also hosts other types of Wikis.

One year after its launch, Klexikon consisted of 1,000 articles and 1,500 articles had been created after two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zeit.de/2015/47/klexikon-internet-kinder-lexikon |title=Wikipedia für Kinder: Wo bleibt der Pups? |language=German |first=Johanna |last=Schoener |work=[[Die Zeit]] |date=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://klexikon.zum.de/wiki/Hilfe:Daten_zum_Klexikon |title=Daten zum Klexikon |language=German |work=Klexikon |date=19 August 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Klexikon community of editors decides per consensus which articles should be created next so as to assure that the most important topics, school subjects and areas of interest of children are covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://klexikon.zum.de/wiki/Hilfe:Artikelw%C3%BCnsche |title=Artikelwünsche |language=German |work=Klexikon |date=12 September 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klexikon was supported by [[Wikimedia Deutschland|Wikimedia Germany]] in creating the concept of an online encyclopedia for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/07/15/klexikon-encyclopedia-for-children/ |title=The Klexikon: a new wiki encyclopedia for children |work=[[Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia BLog]] |date=15 July 2015 |first=Ed |last=Erhart |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was then refined by cooperating with [[Technical University of Dortmund]] and [[Technical University of Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studiger.tu-dortmund.de/images/Ank%C3%BCndigung_Klexikon.pdf |title=klexikon.de: Auf dem Weg zu einer Wikipedia für Kinder – Möglichkeiten für den Deutschunterricht |language=German |publisher=[[Technical University of Dortmund]] |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.th-koeln.de/hochschule/projekt-klexikon_21748.php |title=Projekt 'Klexikon' |language=German |first=Mirka |last=Dickmann |publisher=[[Technical University of Cologne]] |editor-first=Ute Barbara |editor-last=Schilly |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The German [[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth]] considers the site a "useful" children's encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bmfsfj.de/blob/96218/584a19f47509dba7282aa41091959d57/ein-netz-fuer-kinder-gutes-aufwachsen-mit-medien-data.pdf |title=Gutes Aufwachen mit Medien. Ein Netz für Kinder |publisher=[[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth]] |language=German |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the voluntary self control associtation of German television, Klexikon's advantage is that unlike Wikipedia it is specifically written for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.fsf.de/digitale-welt/klexikon-de/2016/07 |title=Klexikon.de: Wenn Wissen mitmachen lässt. |language=German |publisher=Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle Fernsehen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian School Portal wrote that Klexikon was a "great work of reference" which provided content that was speficically balanced for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.schule.at/news/detail/wikipedia-fuer-kinder.html |title=Wikipedia für Kinder |language=German |first=Sabrina |last=Mayrhofer |publisher=Österreichisches Schulportal |date=15 June 2016 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Merz'' magazine noted that Klexikon was an online source of information with relatively reliable content, but criticised that articles did not provide any sources. This was contrary to the need of sensitising school children for marking secondary information as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.merz-zeitschrift.de/?NAV_ID=11&amp;HEFT_ID=149&amp;RECORD_ID=7026 |title=Klexikon: Eine Wikipedia für Kinder |first=Katrin |last=Fleischmann |language=German |issue=4 |year=2015 |work=Merz – Medien + Erziehung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''marlin''' is a fish from the family '''Istiophoridae''', which includes about 10 species. It has an elongated body, a [[spear]]-like [[snout]] or bill, and a long, rigid [[dorsal fin]] which extends forward to form a crest. Its [[common name]] is thought to derive from its resemblance to a sailor's [[marlinspike]].&lt;ref&gt;

==In literature==
[[File:Welcome to Dare County marlin - Stierch.jpg|thumbnail|A [[taxidermy]] marlin greets visitors to [[Dare County, North Carolina]].]]
In the [[Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Ernest Hemingway|Ernest Hemingway's]] 1952 novel ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', the central character of the work is an aged Cuban fisherman who, after 84 days without success on the water, heads out to sea to break his run of bad luck. On the 85th day, Santiago, the old fisherman, hooks a resolute marlin; what follows is a great struggle between man, sea creature, and the elements.

[[Frederick Forsyth]]'s story "The Emperor", in the collection ''[[No Comebacks]]'', tells of a bank manager named Murgatroyd, who catches a marlin and is acknowledged by the islanders of [[Mauritius]] as a master fisherman.

The '''Morgan Library &amp; Museum''' &amp;ndash; formerly the '''Pierpont Morgan Library''' &amp;ndash; is a museum and research library located at 225 [[Madison Avenue]] at [[36th Street (Manhattan)|East 36th Street]] in the [[Murray Hill, Manhattan|Murray Hill]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It was founded to house the private library of [[J. P. Morgan]] in 1906, which included manuscripts and printed books, some of them in rare bindings, as well as his collection of prints and drawings. The library was designed by [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] of the firm of [[McKim, Mead and White]] and cost $1.2 million. It was made a public institution in 1924 by J. P. Morgan's son [[J. P. Morgan, Jr.|John Pierpont Morgan, Jr.]], in accordance with his father's will.

The building was designated a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]] in 1966&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; and was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] later that same year.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwood|first=Richard|url={{NHLS url|id=66000544}}|title="The Pierpont Morgan Library", National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination|date=July 18, 1975|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpphotos"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=66000544|photos=y}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination|date=July 18, 1975|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
{{Main category|Collection of the Morgan Library &amp; Museum}}

Today the library is a complex of buildings which serve as a museum and scholarly research center. The scope of the collection was shaped in its early years as a private collection by [[Belle da Costa Greene]], J.P. Morgan's personal librarian, who became the library's first director and served from the time that it became public until her retirement in 1948. Her successor [[Frederick Baldwin Adams, Jr.]] managed the Library until 1969 and was also world-renowned for his own personal collections. The most internationally significant part of the collection is its relatively small but very select collection of [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and medieval artworks such as the [[Stavelot Triptych]] and the metalwork covers of the [[Lindau Gospels]]. Among the more famous manuscripts are the [[Morgan Bible]], [[Morgan Beatus]], [[Hours of Catherine of Cleves]], [[Farnese Hours]], [[Black Hours, Morgan MS 493|Morgan Black Hours]], and [[Codex Glazier]]. The [[manuscript]] collection also includes authors' original manuscripts, including some by Sir [[Walter Scott]] and [[Honoré de Balzac]], as well as the scraps of paper on which [[Bob Dylan]] jotted down "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" and "[[It Ain't Me Babe]]".

It also contains a large collection of [[incunabula]], prints, and drawings of European artists—[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], [[Dürer]], and [[Picasso]]; early printed [[Bible]]s, among them three [[Gutenberg Bible]]s; and many examples of fine [[bookbinding]]. Other holdings include material from ancient Egypt and medieval liturgical objects (including [[Coptic literature]] examples),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16027d.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Coptic Literature |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=March 1, 1914 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]], [[William Blake|William Blake's]] original drawings for [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|his edition]] of the ''Book of Job''; concept drawings for ''[[The Little Prince]]'' by [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]; a [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] notebook; originals of poems by [[Robert Burns]]; a unique [[Charles Dickens]] manuscript of ''A Christmas Carol'' with handwritten edits and markup from the author; a journal by [[Henry David Thoreau]]; an extraordinary collection of autographed and annotated libretti and scores from Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Mahler and Verdi, and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] Haffner Symphony in D Major; and manuscripts of [[George Sand]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Charlotte Brontë]] and nine of [[Sir Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott's]] novels, including ''Ivanhoe''. The collection still includes a few [[Old Master]] paintings collected by Morgan between 1907 and 1911 (works by [[Hans Memling]], [[Perugino]], and [[Cima da Conegliano]]), but this has never been the collection's focus, and [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]]'s masterpiece ''Portrait of Giovanna Tornabuoni'' was sold to [[Heinrich, Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza de Kászon|Thyssen]] when the Great Depression worsened the Morgan family's finances.&lt;ref&gt;Kandell, Jonathan.

Other notable artists of the Morgan Library and Museum are [[Jean de Brunhoff]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], [[Gaston Phoebus]], [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], and [[John Ruskin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=The Morgan Library &amp; Museum: About | publisher=ARTINFO | year=2008 | url=http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/22151/8669/about/the-morgan-library-and-museum-new-york/ | accessdate=July 30, 2008 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morgan has one of the world's greatest collections of ancient Near Eastern [[cylinder seals]], small stone cylinders finely engraved with images for transfer to clay by rolling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collectionsSeals.asp |title=Overview of Morgan seal collection |publisher=Themorgan.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains many music manuscripts and a considerable collection of Victoriana, including one of the most important collections of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] manuscripts and related artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Frederic Woodbridge. [http://arcadia.org/pml/gs-collection.html The Gilbert and Sullivan Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105164350/http://arcadia.org/pml/gs-collection.html |date=January 5, 2009 }} at The Morgan Library website, accessed May 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Of interest to Australians is a copy of the letter written by Andrea Corsali from India in 1516. This letter, one of five in existence, contains the first description of the [[Southern Cross]] which is also illustrated by Corsali in this letter and which was also named "croce" by him. One other copy of the letter is in the British Library and two are in Australia. The fifth is in the Library of Princeton University. The letter is also readily available in Ramusio's ''Viaggi'', a compendium of letters of exploration, published in Venice in three volumes from 1555.

== Architecture ==
[[File:Morgan Library McKim Building from west.jpg|right|thumb|The historic McKim Building]]
[[File:Morgan Library McKim Building Edward Clark Potter lions.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Clark Potter]]'s lions]]
The first building constructed to house Morgan's library &amp;ndash; the "McKim Building" &amp;ndash; was designed in the [[Classical Revival architecture|Classical Revival style]] by [[Charles Follen McKim]] of the noted firm of [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]] in 1903. Morgan also commissioned a house to be built for his daughter a block away at the same time.  It is located at 33 East 36th Street, which was at the time just to the east of Morgan's residence, a brownstone house at 219 Madison Avenue built in 1880.  McKim took his inspiration from the [[Villa Giulia]] and its [[Nymphaeum]].&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt; The building was constructed from 1902-1907 and has a facade of [[Tennessee marble]] and a [[Palladian architecture|Palladian arch]] entrance which features two lionesses sculpted by [[Edward Clark Potter]], who would later create the two lions that guard the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library]]'s main building.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;&lt;ref name=inside&gt;{{cite inside}}, pp.197-198&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in the entrance are [[roundels]] and panels by [[Andrew O'Connor (sculptor)|Andrew O'Connor]] and [[Adolph Weinman]].&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

[[File:Pierpont Morgan Library LOC gsc.5a29820.jpg|thumb|left|Interior in 1963]]
[[File:I Morgan Library, New York City, NY, USA 2 (2).jpg|thumb|left|Morgan Library, New York City, NY]]
The interior of the building is richly decorated, with a [[polychrome]] rotunda which leads to three public rooms, which were originally Morgan's private study, the librarian's office, and the library itself.&lt;ref name=inside /&gt;  The rotunda itself has a domed ceiling with murals and plasterwork inspired by [[Raphael]], created by [[H. Siddons Mowbray]].  Morgan's study, now the West Library, has been called "one of the greatest achievements of American interior decoration," while the East Library features triple-tiers of bookcases.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

Morgan's residence was torn down in 1928, after his death, to be replaced by an annex building which featured an exhibition hall and a reading room, designed by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]] to harmonize with McKim's original.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

[[File:I Morgan Library, New York City, NY, USA (2).jpg|thumb|upright|The Italianate brownstone house at Madison Avenue and East 37th Street was built in 1854 by Isaac Newton Phelps and bequeathed to his daughter Helen Stokes, wife of [[Anson Phelps Stokes]].]]
The remaining Italianate brownstone house in the library complex is 231 Madison Avenue, on the corner of East 37th Street. This house was built by [[Isaac Newton Phelps]] who bequeathed it to his daughter, Helen Stokes, wife of [[Anson Phelps Stokes]].  She extended the building, doubling the size and adding an additional attic floor (architect [[R. H. Robertson]]).  Their son, architect [[Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes]], was born in the house on April 11, 1867. The house was purchased by J. P. Morgan in 1904. It served as the home of his heir J. P. Morgan Jr. from 1905 to 1943.&lt;ref name="AIA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stokes|first1=Anson Phelps|title=Stokes Records|date=1915|publisher=Privately|page=13|edition=Vol. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2006 renovation ===
[[File:Morgan Library entrance building and library annex.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Renzo Piano]]-designed entrance building (2006, left) and the [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]]-designed annex building (1928, right).]]
The most recent addition to the library is a modernist entrance building designed by Italian architect [[Renzo Piano]] &amp;ndash; his New York City debut &amp;ndash; and [[Beyer Blinder Belle]], which was completed in 2006.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;  Although externally "bland", the building helps to organize the interior spaces of the complex.&lt;ref name="AIA" /&gt;

The Library was closed during the construction and expansion. In the interim it sponsored numerous traveling exhibitions around the country. When the work was completed, it reopened on April 29, 2006 as the Morgan Library &amp; Museum.  With the expansion above and below street level, the Morgan's exhibition space had been doubled; Piano set its new reading room under a translucent roof structure, to allow scholars to examine manuscripts in natural light. Piano's four-story steel-and-glass atrium links McKim's library building and the Morgan house in a new ensemble. Added storage facilities were obtained by drilling into [[Manhattan schist|Manhattan's bedrock schist]].

==Management==
Between 1987 and 2008, Charles E. Pierce Jr. served as director of what was then known as the Pierpont Morgan Library.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (May 20, 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/arts/design/cleveland-museum-of-art-names-william-m-griswold-director.html] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure at the Morgan Library and Museum between 2008 and 2015, director William M. Griswold spearheaded the growth of its collections, exhibition programs and curatorial departments, adding a photography curator in 2013, a first for the institution. In an effort to reach a younger audience, he also presented many contemporary-art exhibitions and installed temporary sculpture in its atrium.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (May 20, 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/arts/design/cleveland-museum-of-art-names-william-m-griswold-director.html Cleveland Hires Leader of Morgan] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Morgan named [[Colin Bailey (museum director)|Colin Bailey]] as its new director.&lt;ref&gt;Pac Pobric (April 17, 2015), [http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/154428/ Colin Bailey named head of the Morgan Library and Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418222726/http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/154428/ |date=April 18, 2015 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mozarthaus Vienna''' was [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s residence from 1784 to 1787. This building in [[Vienna]]'s [[Innere Stadt|Old Town]], not far from [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]], is his only surviving Viennese residence and is now a museum.

==History==

The house is located on Domgasse. It was built in the 17th century, originally with two floors, and redeveloped in 1716. Mozart rented rooms here from 1784, at which time it was also known as the Camesina House, after the family which had owned it since 1720. Since the original entrance of the house facing the Schulerstraße (the one Mozart used) was walled up to make room for a shop, the house has to be entered today from its rear in the Domgasse.

In 1941, the 150th anniversary of Mozart's death, his former rooms were opened to the public as part of "Imperial German Mozart Week", a [[Nazism|National Socialist]] event intended to honour him as a "typically German" composer (in contrast to his polyglot lifestyle). In 1945 the running of the exhibition was taken over by the [[Vienna Museum]]. Despite its apparently attractive location near St. Stephen's Cathedral, visitor numbers at the so-called "Figaro House" were relatively modest, at around 80,000 per year.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 2004, the city of Vienna's ''Wien Holding'' company undertook the total renovation of the Mozarthaus and redesigned it for visitors, and this was completed in time for Mozart Year 2006, the 250th anniversary of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Clients|publisher=Stalzer und Partner|accessdate=30 September 2010|url=http://www.stalzerundpartner.com/clients}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wh&gt;{{Cite web|title=Erfolgsgeschichte Mozarthaus Vienna|publisher=Wien Holding GmbH|accessdate=30 September 2010|date=2006|url=http://www.wienholding.at/event/unternehmen-nachfirmennamen/id/1450|language=de|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706095617/http://www.wienholding.at/event/unternehmen-nachfirmennamen/id/1450|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a complete refurbishment, the entire building (including the expanded basement) became a centre dedicated to the composer's life and work, incorporating the rooms occupied by Mozart himself. This process was overseen by the Vienna Museum. {{Citation needed span|text=The design of the historical courtyard was essentially destroyed by the installation of an elevator. The original 17th-century stone floor of the kitchen was removed and the original oak door of Mozart's apartment was varnished and relocated.|date=July 2011}}

Today the Mozarthaus presents information about the composer in combination with historical exhibits and audio-visual installations, while the basement contains an events hall co-financed by the [[European Union|EU]]. 340,000 people visited the museum in its first three years.&lt;ref name=wh /&gt;

The '''National Film Archive of [[India]]''' was established as a media unit of the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]] in February 1964. Its three principal objectives are
* To trace, acquire and preserve for posterity the heritage of Indian cinema;
* To classify, document data and undertake research relating to films;
* To act as a centre for the dissemination of film culture.

With headquarters at [[Pune]], [[Maharashtra]], NFAI has three regional offices at [[Bangalore]], [[Calcutta]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. Developed from scratch by [[P. K. Nair]], NFAI's activities relating to dissemination of film culture are manifold. Its Distribution Library has about 25 active members throughout the country and it also organises joint screening programmes on weekly, fortnightly and monthly basis in six important centres. It has over 10,000 films, over 10,000 books, over 10,000 film scripts, and over 50,000 photographs. Another important programme is the film teaching scheme comprising long and short term Film Appreciation courses conducted in collaboration with the [[Film and Television Institute of India]] (FTII) and other educational and cultural institutions. At the International level, NFAI supplied several Indian classics for major screening programmes.

[[Prakash Magdum]] is the present director of the NFAI.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiantelevision.com/regulators/people/prakash-magdum-takes-over-as-director-of-nfai-pune-150128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/nfai-heads-toward-creating-a-compilation-of-the-nations-film-heritage/article8911476.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Persian Speech Corpus''' is a [[Modern Persian]] [[speech corpus]] for [[speech synthesis]]. The corpus contains [[phonetic]] and [[Orthography|orthographic]] transcriptions of about 2.5 hours of Persian speech aligned with recorded speech on the [[phoneme]] level, including annotations of [[Word boundary|word boundaries]].&lt;ref name="HALABI2016"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Halabi |first=Nawar |year=2016 |title=Modern Standard Persian Phonetics for Speech Synthesis |url=http://en.persianspeechcorpus.com/Nawar%20Halabi%20PhD%20Thesis%20Revised.pdf |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=[[University of Southampton]], School of Electronics and Computer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous spoken corpora of Persian include FARSDAT, which consists of read aloud speech from newspaper texts from 100 Persian speakers and the Telephone FARsi Spoken language DATabase (TFARSDAT) which comprises seven hours of read and spontaneous speech produced by 60 native speakers of Persian from ten regions of [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Bijankhan, Mahmood, Javad Sheykhzadegan, Mohammad Bahrani, Masood Ghayoomi, 2011. “Lessons from building a Persian written corpus: Peykare” ''Language Resources and Evaluation'' 45.2: 143–164&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persian Speech Corpus was built using the same methodologies laid out in the doctoral project on Modern Standard Arabic of Nawar Halabi at the [[University of Southampton]]. The work was funded by MicroLinkPC, who own an exclusive license to commercialise the corpus, though the corpus is available for non-commercial use through the corpus' website. It is distributed under the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

The corpus was built for speech synthesis purposes, but has been used for building [[Hidden Markov model|HMM]] based voices in Persian. It can also be used to automatically align other speech corpora with their phonetic transcript and could be used as part of a larger corpus for training speech recognition systems.&lt;ref name="HALABI2016"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Halabi |first=Nawar |year=2016 |title=Modern Standard Persian Phonetics for Speech Synthesis |url=http://en.persianspeechcorpus.com/Nawar%20Halabi%20PhD%20Thesis%20Revised.pdf |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=[[University of Southampton]], School of Electronics and Computer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The corpus is downloadable from its website, and contains the following:
* 396 .wav files containing spoken utterances
* 396 .lab files containing text utterances
* 396 .TextGrid files containing the phoneme labels with time stamps of the boundaries where these occur in the .wav files. These files can be opened using Praat software
* phonetic-transcript.txt which has the form "[wav_filename]" "[Phoneme Sequence]" in every line
* orthographic-transcript.txt which has the form "[wav_filename]" "[Orthographic Transcript]" in every line

The '''''Player's Handbook''''' (spelled '''''Players Handbook''''' in first edition ''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''AD&amp;D'')) is a book of rules for the [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''D&amp;D''). It does not contain the complete set of rules for the game, and only includes rules for use by players of the game. Additional rules, for use by [[Dungeon Master]]s (DMs), who [[referee]] the game, can be found in the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]''. Many optional rules, such as those governing extremely high-level players, and some of the more obscure spells, are found in other sources.

Since the first edition,&lt;ref name="WD10"/&gt; the ''Player's Handbook'' has contained tables and rules for creating characters, lists of the abilities of the different [[character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|character classes]], the properties and costs of equipment, descriptions of [[Magic of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|spells]] that [[Magic of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|magic]]-using character classes (such as [[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|wizards]] or [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|clerics]]) can cast, and numerous other rules governing gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Turnbull  | first =Don  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =A Dip Into the Players Handbook  | format = analysis and critique  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | volume =  | issue = 12  | pages =24–25  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  |date=April–May 1979  | url =  | issn =  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' and the ''Player's Handbook'' give advice, tips, and suggestions for various styles of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Pulsipher | first =Lewis  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =An Introduction to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Part II  | format = overview  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | volume =  | issue = 24  | pages =10–11  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  |date=April–May 1981  | url =  | issn =  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Player's Handbook'', ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', and ''[[Monster Manual]]'' make up the core ''D&amp;D'' rulebooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Livingstone  | first =Ian  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =White Dwarf Interviews Gary Gygax  | format = interview  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | volume =  | issue = 14  | pages =23–24  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  |date=August–September 1979  | url =  | issn =  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''==
The first true ''Players Handbook''&lt;!--This edition does not have an apostrophe in the title. Please do not add it--&gt; was released in June, 1978 as a 128-page hardcover.&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schick |first=Lawrence|title=Heroic Worlds: A History and Guide to Role-Playing Games|publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1991|isbn=0-87975-653-5 |pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Acaeum 1E"&gt;[http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/phb.html Players Handbook] at acaeum.com. Retrieved November 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It was written by [[Gary Gygax]] and edited by [[Mike Carr (game designer)|Mike Carr]], who also wrote the foreword. The original cover art was by [[David A. Trampier|D.A. Trampier]],&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; who also provided interior illustrations along with [[David C. Sutherland III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gygax | first=Gary | authorlink = Gary Gygax | title=Player's Handbook | publisher=[[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] | year=1978 | isbn=0-935696-01-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this edition, the game rules were divided between the ''Players Handbook'' and the ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', which was printed later.&lt;ref name="WD10"/&gt; Later editions of the game moved the bulk of the game rules to the ''Player's Handbook'', leaving information needed chiefly by the DM in the ''Dungeon Master's Guide''. The new rules were so open-ended that game campaigns required a referee or [[Dungeon Master]].&lt;ref name="D&amp;Dfaq"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp| title = ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' FAQ| accessdate = 2008-10-03| publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]]| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wizards.com%2Fdnd%2FDnDArchives_FAQ.asp&amp;date=2008-10-03| archivedate = 2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Players Handbook'' contained the information needed to play the standard [[Character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|character classes]]: [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|clerics]] (including [[Druid (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|druids]]), [[Fighter (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|fighters]] (including [[Ranger (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|rangers]] and [[Paladin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|paladins]]), [[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|magic-users]] (including illusionists), [[Rogue (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|thieves]] (including [[Assassin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|assassins]]), and [[Monk (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|monks]].&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; The book also included information on non-human [[Character race (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|races]], such as [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]], [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|elves]], and [[Halfling (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|halflings]], character abilities, armor and weapons, [[Magic of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|spell]] descriptions, and optional rules for [[Psionics (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|psionics]].&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt;

The original ''Players Handbook'' was reviewed by [[Don Turnbull (game designer)|Don Turnbull]] in issue No. 10 of ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'', who gave the book a rating of 10 out of 10. Turnbull noted, "I don't think I have ever seen a product sell so quickly as did the ''Handbook'' when it first appeared on the [[Games Workshop]] stand at Dragonmeet", a British role-playing game convention; after the convention, he studied the book and concluded that "whereas [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974)|the original rules]] are ambiguous and muddled, the ''Handbook'' is a detailed and coherent game-system, and very sophisticated."&lt;ref name="WD10"/&gt; Turnbull felt a bit of apprehension at the amount of time it would require to digest all the new material, but concluded by saying "I said of the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' that it was TSR's most impressive publication to date; that is no longer true&amp;mdash;this accolade must belong to the ''Handbook'' which is nothing short of a triumph."&lt;ref name="WD10"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Turnbull  | first =Don  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Open Box: Players Handbook| type = review  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | volume =  | issue = 10  | page =17  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  |date=December 1978 – January 1979  | url =  | issn =  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[TSR (company)|TSR]] changed the cover art of the ''Players Handbook'', although the interior contents remained the same.&lt;ref name="Acaeum 1E" /&gt; This printing featured cover art by [[Jeff Easley]].&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; Printings with this cover also bear an orange spine that fits in with other ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=126&amp;editionid=9077 RPGnet d20 RPG Game Index: AD&amp;D First Edition Players Handbook (1983 TSR edition)].

Dealers continued to place orders for the 1st edition ''Players Handbook'' even after 2nd edition was released, causing the final printing to be in July 1990, a year after the release of 2nd edition.&lt;ref name="Acaeum 1E" /&gt;

In 2012, Wizards of the Coast released a new printing of the original book, billed as the "1st Edition Premium Player's Handbook", as part of a set of limited-edition reprints of the original 1st Edition core rulebooks: the ''Monster Manual'', ''Player's Handbook'', and ''Dungeon Master's Guide''. These premium versions of the original ''AD&amp;D'' rulebooks were reprinted with the original art and content, but feature a new cover design.

The ''Player's Handbook'' for 2nd edition was compatible with 1st edition rules, but was streamlined and clarified.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; The book included information on how to play the standard character classes: warriors (including fighters, paladins, and rangers), wizards (including mages and specialist wizards such as illusionists), priests (clerics and guidelines for variance by mythos, including the druid as an example), and rogues (including thieves and [[Bard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|bards]]); while most character classes remained about the same as in the 1st edition rules, the bard was regularized, and the assassin and monk were dropped.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; [[TSR, Inc.]] also removed some races from the game, such as half-orcs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/archetypology21dec01.html To Be Orc Not To Be] from RPGnet.

''The [[Complete Book of Humanoids]]'' (TSR, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Optional rules for skills, known as ''proficiencies'', were added, and sections describing role-playing, combat, magic, time and movement, equipment, and spell descriptions were all expanded.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; The book included major changes regarding character classes, races, and magic, and incorporated many new rules that had been published in supplements such as ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' and ''[[Dragonlance Adventures]]''.

The 2nd edition ''Player's Handbook'' was an [[Origins Award|Origins]] and Gamer's Choice award winner.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; [[Lawrence Schick]], in his 1991 book ''Heroic Worlds'', called the book "a vast improvement" over the 1st edition book; he noted that the monk character class had been "banished to ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' where it belongs", but commented that the spell descriptions "have positively bloated to over 100 pages".&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt;

The third edition also dropped the word ''Advanced'' from the title, as the publisher decided to publish only one version of the game instead of both basic and advanced versions.

[[Monte Cook]], [[Jonathan Tweet]], and [[Skip Williams]] all contributed to the 3rd edition ''Players Handbook'', ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'', and ''[[Monster Manual]]'', and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions.&lt;ref name="Dragon #275"&gt;{{cite journal| last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Profiles: Monte Cook| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #275| pages = 10, 12, 14| publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]]| location = [[Renton, Washington]]|date=September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tweet is credited with the book's design.

The reviewer from ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' commented on the release of third edition, stating: "There's a lot to like about ''Dungeons and Dragons'' 3rd Edition as seen in the ''Player's Handbook''. The new artwork is gorgeous and evocative, and in the 286 pages of the main rulebook there's a lot of well-written and tightly packed rules."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=1806 Pyramid, Steve Jackson Games]&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer wrote a response to the first review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=1822 Pyramid, Steve Jackson Games]&lt;/ref&gt; A third reviewer felt that the design team "smoothed out the rough edges from ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragon'' 2nd Edition and added tons of new goodies to make ''D&amp;D'' 3rd Edition the best combat-oriented RPG you can buy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=1823 Pyramid, Steve Jackson Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''Player's Handbook'' includes eight classes: cleric, fighter, paladin, ranger, rogue, warlock, warlord, and wizard, and eight races: dragonborn, dwarf, eladrin, elf, human, half-elf, halfling, and tiefling.  The warlock and warlord classes, and the dragonborn and tiefling races, represented new additions to the core rules, while the book left out previous core elements such as the monk and bard classes and the gnome and half-orc races.  Wizards of the Coast emphasized that those elements would be coming in subsequent ''Player's Handbooks'' and would be considered to be as central to the game as those in the first book.

The ''Player's Handbook'' contains the basic rules of the 5e system, the base classes and races, and character customization options.

Chuck Francisco of mania.com commented: "While it was an easily accessible system, 4e left a lukewarm feeling with my gaming group. There was something too generic and uninteresting about player characters which pervaded the system, especially in the wake of 3.5e (which some felt provided too many options so as to be confusing). In the process, 4e characters lost an indescribable crunchy feeling, but I'm pleased to say that it's been brought back for the newest installment of this venerated table top series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/dungeons-dragons-5th-edition-players-handbook-review_article_140311.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325051125/http://www.mania.com/dungeons-dragons-5th-edition-players-handbook-review_article_140311.html|archivedate=March 25, 2015|date=August 15, 2014|title=Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition Player's Handbook Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Zimmerman Jones of ''[[Black Gate (magazine)|Black Gate]]'' comments on the 5th edition ''Player's Handbook'': "Their rules light approach make it a natural system for old fans to bring new players into the hobby, but even with this initial offering there are enough customization options to keep old school gamers happy playing with it."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.blackgate.com/2014/08/31/dnd5eoverview/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Record sealing''' is the practice of sealing or, in some cases, destroying court records that would otherwise be publicly accessible as [[public record]]s. The term is derived from the tradition of placing a [[Seal (device)|seal]] on specified files or documents that prevents anyone from reviewing the files without receiving a [[court order]]. The modern process and requirements to seal a record and the protections it provides vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and even between [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] cases.

Generally, record sealing can be defined as the process of removing from general review the records pertaining to a [[court case]]. However, the records may not completely disappear and may still be reviewed under limited circumstances; in most instances, it requires a court order to unseal records once they are sealed. In the United States, some states order records to be destroyed after they are sealed. Once a record is sealed, in some states, the contents are legally considered never to have occurred and are not acknowledged by the state.

The public policy of record sealing balances the desire to free named citizens from the burdens caused by the information contained in state records while maintaining the state's interest in the preservation of records that may be beneficial to the state or other citizens.&lt;ref name=hig/&gt;

In many cases, a person with a sealed record gains the legal right to deny or not acknowledge anything to do with the arrest and the legal proceedings from the case itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul J. Adras, Esq.|url = http://www.recordseal.com|title=Why seal your record?|accessdate=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Records are commonly sealed in a number of situations:
*[[Sealed birth records]] (usually for so-called [[closed adoption]], in which the birthparents' identity is usually anonymous)
*Juvenile criminal records may be sealed
*Other types of cases involving juveniles may be sealed, anonymized, or pseudonymized ("impounded"); e.g., child sex offense or custody cases
*Cases using [[witness protection]] information may be partly sealed
*Cases involving [[trade secret]]s
*Cases involving [[Classified information|state secrets]]

==Filing under seal in US  court==
{{Further information|Under seal (law)}}
Normally, records should not be filed under seal without a court permission.&lt;ref name="calif"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=two&amp;linkid=rule2_551|title=2011 California Rules of Court}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] 5.2 requires that sensitive text – like Social Security number, Taxpayer Identification Number, birthday, bank accounts, and children’s names – should be redacted off the filings made with the court and accompanying exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule5_2.htm|title=FRCP Rule 5.2. Privacy Protection For Filings Made with the Court}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person making a redacted filing can file an unredacted copy under seal, or the Court can choose to order later that an additional filing be made under seal without redaction. Alternately, the filing party may ask the court’s permission to file some exhibits completely under seal.

When the document is filed "under seal", it should have a clear indication for the [[court clerk]] to file it separately – most often by stamping words "Filed Under Seal" on the bottom of each page. Person making filing should also provide instructions to the court clerk that the document needs to be filed "under seal". Courts often have specific requirements to these filings in their Local Rules.

==Ongoing litigation==
A Delaware background check corporation by the name of IntegraScan has filed for Declaratory Relief in both the states of Texas and New Jersey. The position of IntegraScan is that state mandated record sealing and expungements do not apply to private corporations, only state and Federal run agencies. The contention of the suits are that record sealing and expungement orders applied to corporations and private citizens violate First Amendment rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integrascan.com/expungement.pdf IntegraScan Expungement Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference from expungement ==
[[Expungement]], which is a physical destruction, namely a complete erasure of one's criminal records, and therefore usually carries a higher standards, differs from record sealing, which is only to restrict the public's access to records, so that only certain law enforcement agencies or courts, under special circumstances, will have access to them. A record seal will greatly improve the chance of employment, as employers will not have access to damning records. There are occasions, like expungement, where one can truthfully state under oath that they have never been convicted before.

Most of the time, a record seal has more relaxed requirements than an expungement. If an expungement is not allowed with a case, then sealing a record may be the best bet. Different states have different terms for what constitutes sealing of a record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Restaurant ratings''' identify [[restaurant]]s according to their quality, using notations such as stars or other symbols, or numbers. [[Star (classification)|Stars]] are a familiar and popular symbol, with scales of one to three or five stars commonly used. Ratings appear in [[guide book|guide books]] as well as in the media, typically in [[newspaper]]s, lifestyle [[magazine]]s and [[webzine]]s. Websites featuring consumer-written reviews and ratings are increasingly popular, but are far less reliable.&lt;ref name="irishtimes1"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/0923/1224304574180.html 'Fake' reviews on TripAdvisor a real problem for hoteliers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are ratings given by [[public health]] agencies rating the level of [[food safety|sanitation]] practiced by an establishment. 

== Restaurant guides ==
One of the best known guides is the [[Michelin Guide|Michelin series]] which award one to three stars to restaurants they perceive to be of high culinary merit. One star indicates a "very good restaurant"; two stars indicate a place "worth a detour"; three stars means "exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey".

Several bigger newspapers employ restaurant [[critic]]s and publish online dining guides for the cities they serve, such as the [[Irish Independent]] for [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] restaurants.

Internet restaurant review sites have empowered regular people to generate non-expert reviews. This has sparked criticism from restaurant establishments about the non-editorial, non-professional critiques. Those reviews can be falsified or faked.&lt;ref name="irishtimes1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2059000/TripAdvisor-controversy-Reviews-website-launches-complaints-hotlines.html TripAdvisor responds to 'fake reviews' controversy with phone lines for aggrieved hotel owners]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rating criteria ===
The different guides have their own criteria. Not every guide looks behind the scenes or decorum. Others look particularly sharply to value for money. This is why a restaurant can be missing in one guide, while mentioned in another. Because the guides work independently, it is possible to have simultaneous multiple recognitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askmen.com/fine_living/wine_dine_archive_100/115_wine_dine.html 5 Things You Didn't Know About The Michelin Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michelintravel.com/about/faq.html#10 What are the criteria for receiving Michelin stars?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissholidayco.com/page/GAULT_MILLAU Gault Millau criteria]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}}[http://www.smulweb.nl/158258/special/toprestaurants/Toprestaurants-op-Smulweb Smulweb criteria]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agfg.com.au/agfg/ratings-symbols/awards AGFG Chef Hat Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ratings impact ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=December 2015}}

A top restaurant rating can mean success or failure for a restaurant, particularly when bestowed by an influential sources such as Michelin. Still, a good rating is not enough for economic success and many Michelin starred and/or highly rated restaurants have met the same fate as the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] restaurant [[De Swaen (restaurant)|De Swaen]].

In 2004, Michelin came under fire after [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] chef [[Bernard Loiseau]] committed [[suicide]] after he was rumoured to be in danger of losing one of his three Michelin stars. However, the Michelin guide had stated he would not be downgraded. Most news reports attributed his suicide to the downgrade carried out by the rival [[Gault Millau]] guide.

==Sanitation==
Many countries have a system of checks and inspections in place for sanitation. Only a few countries, amongst others the United States and Canada, create and publish restaurant ratings based on this. However, the whole of the United Kingdom is covered - as is Denmark.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

===United States===

In the United States, several states have imposed uniform statewide restaurant grading systems, under which safety and hygiene inspection reports are used to compute numerical scores or letter grades, and those must be prominently posted by restaurants.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Michael T.|title=Food Law in the United States|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9781107117600|pages=181-182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JsEwCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first state to enact such a statewide system was South Carolina in 1995.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Tennessee and North Carolina later enacted legislation imposing similar statewide systems.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

In many other states, the mandatory posting of restaurant grades is neither required nor prohibited statewide, which means it is purely a matter for local governments like cities and counties.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; 

====Los Angeles====
In November 1997, a [[KCBS-TV]] [[sweeps]] news story called ''Behind The Kitchen Door'' focused attention on problems in [[Los Angeles]]'s top restaurants. The station used [[hidden cameras]] to catch restaurant employees practicing unsafe food handling practices such as picking up food from the floor and re-serving it, vermin crawling near food to be served, and mixing uncooked meat and vegetables.{{cn|date=October 2013}} The KCBS report also reviewed inspection reports, which have always been public records, but were available only on request (and at the time required an in-person visit to the health department), and found that many problems had already been expressly identified in the inspection reports but had not been adequately publicized.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

As a result of this report, in December 1997 the [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors|Board of Supervisors]] of [[Los Angeles County]] introduced a letter grading system already in use for some years in two other nearby counties, [[San Diego County]] and [[Riverside County]]. Instead of merely listing violations in a report, the restaurant inspection system was changed to a point system, with each restaurant starting each inspection with a perfect score of 100 points.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;  Environmental health specialists were required to use a standard form called the Food Official Inspection Report to identify violations as they inspected establishments; the form required them to subtract a certain number of points for each violation found.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Based on the number of points remaining, letter grades were then assigned and required to be prominently posted at all establishments selling food, and all establishments were also required to provide a copy of the underlying inspection report to any customer on request.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Grades are available at the County Public Health Department's web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lapublichealth.org/rating/ |title=LA County Department of Public Health - Facility Rating |publisher=Lapublichealth.org |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[Stanford University]] economics researchers found that higher lettered restaurants scored a rise in revenue, while lower lettered restaurants have seen their revenues decline. The quality of restaurants in the entire county became more acceptable, with the average score going up from about 75% to nearly 90% in the year after restaurant grading was implemented. The researchers concluded that the results were not explained solely by consumers switching to higher quality restaurants, and that some of the effect had to do with restaurants making changes due to grade cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://are.berkeley.edu/~sberto/restaurants.pdf |title=Restaurants |publisher=Are.berkley.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/~pleslie/Jin%20and%20Leslie%20Choices%202005.pdf |title=The Case in Support of Restaurant Hygiene Grade Cards |publisher=stanford.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819050454/http://www.stanford.edu/~pleslie/Jin%20and%20Leslie%20Choices%202005.pdf |archivedate=2007-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study estimated a 13.1% reduction in hospitalization for food borne illnesses in the year following implementation of the program, suggesting that implementing a restaurant grading program could improve public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuafu.umd.edu/~ginger/research/JEH-final.pdf |title=Impact of Restaurant Hygiene Grade Cards on Foodborne-Disease Hospitalizations in Los Angeles County |publisher=Kuafu.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Los Angeles County was not the first local jurisdiction to require restaurants to post grades, its success in implementing such a program inspired many other local governments during the 2000s to enact similar programs based on the Los Angeles model, such as Toronto, Las Vegas, Dallas, and New York City.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

The '''Salon d'Hercule''' (also known as the '''Hercules Salon''' or the '''Hercules Drawing Room''') is on the [[first floor]] of the [[Château de Versailles]] and connects the [[Royal Chapel of Versailles|Royal Chapel]] in the North Wing of the château with the ''[[grand appartement du roi]]''.

==Description==
Originally, the fourth and penultimate chapel, the ''salon d’Hercule'' occupies the tribune level of this chapel.  Initially called the ''nouveau salon près de la chapelle''  (new salon near the chapel) when the room was started in 1710 by [[Robert de Cotte]] for [[Louis XIV]].  However, with the death of [[Louis XIV]] in 1715 the project was postponed (Verlet, 321).

Beginning in 1724, work on the ''salon d’Hercule'' recommenced. [[Louis XV]] commissioned architect [[Jacques Gabriel]], ''marbrier'' [[Claude-Félix Tarlé]], and sculptors [[Jacques Verberckt]] and [[François-Antoine Vassé]] to complete the room (Verlet, 321).

The room was completed in 1736 with the ceiling painting ''Apothéose d’Hercule'' (''Apotheosis of Hercules'') by [[François Le Moyne]], which gave the room its present name (Verlet, 322).

There are only two other paintings decorating this room, both of which are by [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]].  Above the fireplace is the artist’s ''Rebecca at the Well''; on the opposite wall forming a pendant is the famed ''Feast in the House of Simon'' (Verlet, 322). [[Louis XIV]] received the latter painting as a [[diplomatic gift]] from the Republic of Venice in 1664.  Owing to the size of the work – 4.5 meters high by 9.7 meters long – the painting was displayed in the ''[[galerie d’Apollon]]'' of the [[Louvre]].  It was installed in ''salon d’Hercule'' in 1730 where it remained until 1832 at which time it was transferred to the [[Louvre]]. In 1961 the ''Feast in the House of Simon'' was returned to the ''salon d’Hercule.''  In 1994, under the aegis of the Société des amis de Versailles and BNP the painting was restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amisdeversailles.com/chateau-de-versailles-restauration-le-repas-chez-simon-par-veronese.html Société des amis de Versailles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120185429/http://www.amisdeversailles.com/chateau-de-versailles-restauration-le-repas-chez-simon-par-veronese.html |date=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Louis XV]] the room served as a ball room as the king felt the [[salon de Mars]] was too small and the ''[[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|galerie des glaces]]'' was too large.  The inaugural ball held in the ''salon d’Hercule'' was on 26 January 1739 to celebrate the marriage of [[Louis XV|Louis XV’s]] eldest daughter [[Princess Louise-Élisabeth of France|Marie Louise-Élisabeth]] with [[Philip, Duke of Parma|Infante Filipe of Spain]] (Luynes, 335-345); and the wedding dinner ''au grand courvert'' of the [[Louis Philippe d'Orléans (1747-1793)|duc de Chartres]] on 5 January 1769 (Verlet, 323).  After the destruction of the ''[[escalier des ambassadeurs]]'' in 1752, [[Louis XV]] planned for the ''salon d’Hercule'' to be the landing for a new staircase for the château (Verlet, 323).

During the reign of [[Louis XVI]] the ''salon d’Hercule'' served for diplomatic functions such as the embassy sent by the bey of Tunis (January 1777); the receptions of the representatives of the Three Estates of the [[French States-General|Estates-General]] (May 1789); and, the reception of the embassy of the sultan [[Mysore]] (September 1778) (Verlet, 555).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2825">The '''Seattle Municipal Archives''' are the official [[archive]] of the city of [[Seattle]]. The organization is housed in [[Seattle City Hall]].

The organization was formally established in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://seattletimes.com/html/pacificnw/2011311575_pacificpdorp21.html |title=Revived Seattle Municipal Archives celebrate 25 years |first=Paul |last=Dorpat |work=seattletimes.com |date=20 March 2010 |accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Seattle stores its city records here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seattlechannel.org/CityStream/segments?videoid=x21445 |title=CityStream: City Clerk's Collection |first=Feliks |last=Banel  |work=seattlechannel.org |date=3 October 2013 |accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seattle Municipal Archive accepted a {{US$|100,000}} from the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] to process records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.archives.gov/nhprc/projects/states-territories/wa.html |title=Washington |author=no author listed |work=archives.gov |date=n.d. |accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2002 many of the archives photographs from before the 1930s had begun to deteriorate and the archival budget did not allow for all of them to be digitized to contemporary quality standards for archives.&lt;ref name="Murakami 2002"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/City-s-old-photographs-literally-fading-with-time-1084665.php |title=City's old photographs literally fading with time - seattlepi.com |first=Kery |last=Murakami |work=seattlepi.com |date=7 April 2002 |accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the archival collection had at least been scanned, but many of the pieces were low quality, and the decision was made to prioritize 3000 of the 1,500,000 pieces in the collection for high quality [[digital preservation]].&lt;ref name="Murakami 2002"/&gt; Most of the archive's pictures from this time period were taken by city workers and document civil engineering.&lt;ref name="Murakami 2002"/&gt;

From its founding until the present, Scott Cline has served as director of the archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www2.kuow.org/program.php?id=16981 |title=The Seattle Municipal Archives |first=Jeannie |last=Yandel |work=www2.kuow.org |publisher=[[KUOW-FM]] |date=20 February 2009 |accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cline studied history at [[Portland State University]].&lt;ref name="Murakami 2002"/&gt;

'''The Vault''' is a [[wiki]] about the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' [[fictional universe]]. It covers all of the ''Fallout'' video games, as well as all ''Fallout'' related content. The Vault runs on [[MediaWiki]] and is currently part of the Curse network.&lt;ref name="Curse" /&gt; The site is also available in several other languages, including [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

==History and description==
The Vault was founded by [[Paweł Dembowski]]&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt; and launched on February 7, 2005, initially hosted by ''Fallout'' fansite Duck and Cover,&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt; as a general source of information about the ''Fallout'' universe, initially focusing mostly on information about the ''Fallout'' world, as depicted in ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' and ''[[Fallout 2]]''. Its purpose was to continue the work started by ''Fallout 2'' developer [[Chris Avellone]] in his ''Fallout Bible'', which was meant to be a reference guide to the ''Fallout'' [[fictional universe]], but was abandoned after Avellone left [[Black Isle Studios]].&lt;ref name="News.com.au" /&gt; Since the launch, the wiki has expanded to include the entire ''Fallout'' series, both in terms of the fictional universe and in terms of gameplay information and help.

In 2007, because the original host could no longer take the wiki constantly being targeted for various exploits by spammers as well as other attackers, the Vault moved to [[Wikia]],&lt;ref name="The Vault" /&gt; and became one of Wikia's most popular wikis after the release of ''[[Fallout 3]]'' by [[Bethesda Softworks]] in October 2008.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt; It has broken previous popularity records for gaming wikis on the weekend after the release of ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' in October 2010, with daily page views topping at 8.8 million&lt;ref name="News.com.au" /&gt; (the previous record, 5 million, belonged to [[WoWWiki]]).&lt;ref name="Kotaku" /&gt; Within the first week of the game's release, the site had 2.5 million unique visitors.&lt;ref name="Destructoid" /&gt;

In October 2011, The Vault was split by its founder and many of the administrators moved to FalloutWiki.com, and later [http://fallout.gamepedia.com fallout.gamepedia.com], both hosted by Curse.&lt;ref name="The Vault" /&gt; The wikia version remains, now under the name "[[Nukapedia]]".

In an interview with [[Eurogamer]], the wiki's founder has stated that it has even been used as a source by developers of recent ''Fallout'' games, citing one example of lore in ''[[Fallout 3]]'' being influenced by The Vault.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt;

The Vault has also released some previously unknown information on canceled ''Fallout'' projects like the ''[[Fallout Extreme]]'' 2000 console game&lt;ref name="Joystiq" /&gt; and the 1998 cancelled ''Fallout'' film project,&lt;ref name="Game Informer" /&gt; as well as using its [[YouTube]] [https://www.youtube.com/user/TheVaultWiki channel] and other social media to make available audio and video ''Fallout'' Media.

'''''Thienhaus NO v Metje &amp; Ziegler Ltd and Another'''''&lt;ref&gt;1965 (3) SA 25 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[South African property law|property]] [[South African law|law]]. It was heard in the Appellate Division, by Steyn CJ, Van Blerk JA, Ogilvie Thompson JA, Williamson JA and Wessels JA, on 22 February 1965, with judgment handed down on 1 April.

== Facts ==
G owed money to M, the respondent. The debt was secured by a mortgage passed on property belonging to B in favour of M. The mortgage bond was incorrectly worded to indicate that the debt was owed by SG (who happened to be the sole shareholder of G). When B became insolvent, T was appointed liquidator. M sought a preferential right in terms of the mortgage bond, but this claim was rejected by T on the grounds that, due to the factual inaccuracy, the mortgage had not come into existence.

== Judgment ==
The court held, firstly, that a mortgage bond may be used both as an instrument of hypothecation and also as a record of debt, and secondly that it is matter of custom in drafting mortgage bonds to incorporate an admission of liability by the mortgagor to facilitate a quick and easy remedy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16572">A '''tobacco fatwa''' is a [[fatwa]] ([[Islam]]ic legal pronouncement) that prohibits the usage of [[tobacco]] by [[Muslim]]s. All contemporary rulings condemn smoking as potentially harmful or prohibit ([[haraam|haram]]) smoking outright as a result of the [[Health effects of tobacco|severe health damage]] that it causes. [[Arab Muslims]] tend to prohibit smoking (despite [[Saudi Arabia]] ranking 23rd in the world for the percentage of its population that smokes)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanbedu.com/2009/10/09/saudi-arabia-don%E2%80%99t-keep-us-from-smoking/|title=Saudi Arabia:  Don’t Keep Us From Smoking|work=American Bedu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in South Asia, smoking tends to be considered lawful but discouraged:&lt;ref name="Ghouri et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghouri|first1=N|last2=Atcha|first2=M|last3=Sheikh|first3=A|title=Influence of Islam on smoking among Muslims.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=4 February 2006|volume=332|issue=7536|pages=291-4|doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7536.291|pmid=16455732|pmc=1360407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many Muslims, the legal status of smoking has changed during recent years, and numerous fatawas, including from notable authorities such as [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo, now consider smoking ''[[haram]]'' (prohibited). The reasons cited in support of the reclassification of smoking as prohibited include [[Islamic law]]'s general prohibition of all actions that result in harm. For example, the Quran says, "And spend of your substance in the cause of God, and make not your own hands contribute to your own destruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|2|195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, jurists rely on the exhortations in the Quran not to waste money. Greater appreciation of the risks associated with [[secondhand smoke]] has also led recent jurists to cite the obligation to avoid causing willful annoyance, distress, or harm to other people.&lt;ref name="Ghouri et al. 2006"/&gt;

Fatwas condemning smoking have been issued in [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Malaysia]], [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[UAE]], among others.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;&lt;ref name=Byron /&gt;  

==History==
The earliest fatwa regarding smoking was issued in Morocco in 1602. Following the introduction of tobacco to the kingdom in 1598, King [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] sought guidance from religious scholars in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. The kingdom's Grand Mufti and the Wali of Sila both ruled that smoking was forbidden in Islam. This ruling failed to have much effect on tobacco use in the kingdom, leading the Mufti to issue a second ruling forbidding its use, as the use of all "intoxicants and harmful substances" is forbidden in Islam. This categorical prohibition was unsuccessful, and the Mufti and the other scholars who joined him in his ruling were either killed by a mob angry at this ruling or fled the country.{{r|WHO|pp=13-15}}

In recent years, [[tobacco fatwa]]s (Islamic legal pronouncements) have been issued due to health concerns.

The holy book of [[Islam]], the [[Qur'ān]], does not specifically prohibit or denounce smoking, but gives behavioral guidance:

* “Don't throw yourself into danger by your own hands...” (el-Bakara 2/195)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|2|195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* “You may eat, drink, but not waste” (el-A‘râf 7/31)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|7|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Do not kill yourselves for God Almighty is most merciful to you" (en-Nisaa' 4/29)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|4|29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, at least one recent survey (Abbottabad, [[Pakistan]]) found that observant Muslims tend to avoid smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hameed|first1=A|last2=Jalil|first2=MA|last3=Noreen|first3=R|last4=Mughal|first4=I|last5=Rauf|first5=S|title=Role of Islam in prevention of smoking.|journal=Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad|date=2002|volume=14|issue=1|pages=23-5|pmid=12043328|url=http://www.ayubmed.edu.pk/JAMC/PAST/14-1/Hameed.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of young Muslim Arab-Americans found that Islamic influences were correlated with some diminished smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Islam|first1=SM|last2=Johnson|first2=CA|title=Correlates of smoking behavior among Muslim Arab-American adolescents.|journal=Ethnicity &amp; Health|date=November 2003|volume=8|issue=4|pages=319-37|doi=10.1080/13557850310001631722|pmid=14660124|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a714038251~db=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, an Egyptian study found that knowledge of an anti-smoking [[fatwa]] did not reduce smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radwan |first1=GN |last2=Israel |first2=E |last3=El-Setouhy |first3=M |last4=Abdel-Aziz |first4=F |last5=Mikhail |first5=N |last6=Mohamed |first6=MK |title=Impact of religious rulings (Fatwa) on smoking. |journal=Journal of the Egyptian Society of Parasitology |date=December 2003 |volume=33 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=1087-101 |pmid=15119472 |url=http://www.nosmokingegypt.com/FATWA.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041012204303/http://www.nosmokingegypt.com/FATWA.pdf |archivedate=2004-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the prevalence of smoking is increasing in Islamic countries.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

The prominent scholar [[Yusuf al Qaradawi]] argues that smoking is no longer an issue of dispute among Islamic scholars due to the knowledge of health risks.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reported juristic disagreement among Muslim scholars on the ruling concerning smoking, since its appearance and spread, is not usually based on differences between legal proofs, but on the difference in the verification of the cause on which the ruling is based. They all agree that whatever is proved to be harmful to the body and mind is prohibited, yet they differ whether this ruling applies to smoking. Some of them claimed that smoking has some benefits, others assured that it had few disadvantages compared to its benefits, whereas a third group maintained that it had neither benefits nor bad effects. This means that if scholars had been certain about the harmfulness of smoking, then they would undoubtedly have considered it prohibited.[…]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Second: Our inclination to consider smoking prohibited does not mean that it is as grave as major sins like adultery, drinking alcohol or theft. In fact, prohibited matters in Islam are relative; some of them are minor prohibitions whereas others are major, and each has its own ruling. The major sins, for example, have no expiation other than sincere repentance. However, the minor sins can be expiated by the Five Prayers, the [[Friday Prayer]], the Fasting of [[Ramadan]], the Night Vigil Prayer in Ramadan, and other acts of worship. They can also be expiated by avoiding the major sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503548726 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213192447/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503548726 |title=Is the Ruling on Smoking Still Controversial? - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar |archivedate=13 February 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fatwas ruling that smoking is impermissible have been issued by sheikhs of all four Sunni schools of [[fiqh]]—[[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Hanbali]]—as well as by those of the [[Ibadi]] sect.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

==Egypt==
In 2000, the [[Grand Mufti of Egypt]], Dr. [[Nasr Farid Wasil]], ruled that smoking was ''[[haram]]''  (forbidden) in Islam because of its detrimental health effects.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Khayat |editor1-first=M.H. |title=Islamic Ruling on Smoking |date=2000 |publisher=World Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean |location=Alexandria, Egypt |isbn=92-9021-277-2 |edition=2 |url=http://applications.emro.who.int/dsaf/dsa46.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fatwa, which ruled that smoking is a major sin on par with alcohol use and acceptable grounds for divorce, triggered substantial controversy in Egypt.&lt;ref name=Hossam&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hassan |first1=Hossam |title=RELIGION-EGYPT: Fatwa On Smoking Triggers Debate |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2000/10/religion-egypt-fatwa-on-smoking-triggers-debate/ |accessdate=2 August 2018 |work=IPS |date=October 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grand Imam Gadul Haq Ali Gadul Haq, the Sheikh of [[al-Azhar mosque]], the center of Islamic learning in the Sunni world, issued a similar ruling in 2000, citing the following verse from the Quran as justification: "and cast not yourselves to ruin with your own hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|2|195}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|WHO|pg=22}} 

==Indonesia==
In 2009, [[Majelis Ulama Indonesia]], the organization of Indonesian religious scholars, declared smoking in public or near pregnant women ''haram'' (forbidden), while declaring smoking in general to be ''[[makruh]]'' (discouraged or reprehensible).&lt;ref name=Byron&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008111| issn = 2044-6055| volume = 5| issue = 12| pages = –008111| last1 = Byron| first1 = M.

==Iran==
Iran’s Grand Ayatollah [[Mirza Shirazi]] in 1891 [[Tobacco Protest|issued a fatwa against tobacco]].

==Malaysia==
Malaysia's [[National Fatwa Council]] first issued a fatwa against smoking in 1996, when it declared smoking haram because of its detrimental health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Don’t take ‘smoking is haram’ fatwa lightly, Muslims told |url=https://www.malaymail.com/s/487343/dont-take-smoking-is-haram-fatwa-lightly-muslims-told |accessdate=2 August 2018 |work=malaymail |date=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a study of Muslims and Buddhists in Malaysia found that this fatwa and other religious norms against smoking have had an independent and significant increase in quit attempts.

==Oman==
In 1996, Sheikh Ahmed Bin Hamad Al Khalili, the Grand Mufti of Oman, issued a fatwa prohibiting smoking and the sale of tobacco, comparing smoking to "sipping poison" Sheikh Al Khalili cited a verse from the Quran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|4|29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "do not kill yourselves for God Almighty is most merciful to you," to justify his ruling.{{r|WHO|pg=91}}

==The Philippines ==
The Supreme Council of Darul Ifta of the Philippines, headed by Grand Mufti Sheikh Omar Pasigan, stated in June 2010 that smoking cigarettes is ''haram''.&lt;ref name="forbidden to smoke"&gt;{{cite news

==Saudi Arabia==
The [[Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia]], Sheikh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Aal Al-Sheikh, has ruled that "smoking is impermissible on the basis of authentic quotations, sound judgments, and the opinions of reputable physicians."{{r|WHO|pg=97}} The Mufti cites a sahih [[hadith]] (verifiable saying of the Prophet) saying "do not harm yourself or others." He further referenced a Quranic verse saying that the Prophet "forbids that which is unwholesome." 

==The UAE==
In addition to issuing a fatwa against smoking, the United Arab Emirates instructed imams in all mosques to read a sermon against smoking on June 11, 1999 following [[Friday prayers]].{{r|WHO|pg=105}}

==Tobacco industry pushback==
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, tobacco companies including [[British American Tobacco]] and [[Altria Group|Phillip Morris]] were involved in campaigns to undermine fatwas against smoking in [[Muslim majority countries]] by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a {{"'}}fundamentalist'? who wishes to return to [[Shariah|sharia law]]", and be "a threat to existing government".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boseley |first1=Sarah |title=How tobacco firms tried to undermine Muslim countries' smoking ban |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/20/tobacco-firms-tried-undermine-muslim-countries-smoking-ban|accessdate=5 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|title=How tobacco firms try to undermine Muslim countries' smoking ban|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/04/21/84683.php|accessdate=5 February 2017|publisher=[[The Bangladesh Observer]]|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tobacco industry]] was also concerned that the [[World Health Organization]]'s encouraging of anti-smoking stance of [[Ulama|Muslim scholars]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 1985 report from tobacco firm Philip Morris squarely blamed the WHO: "This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO ... The WHO has not only joined forces with Muslim fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Unitrin, Inc. v. American General Corp.''''', 651 A.2d 1361 (Del. 1995) is the leading case on a [[board of directors]]' ability to use defensive measures, such as [[poison pill]]s or [[Share repurchase|buybacks]], to prevent a [[Takeover|hostile takeover]]. The case demonstrates an approach to [[corporate governance]] that favors the primacy of the board of directors over the will of the shareholders.

==Facts==
American General Corp. tendered an offer for a controlling block of shares of Unitrin. The Board of Directors of Unitrin, who held 23% of the shares, did not think the price offered was adequate and so initiated a poison pill and offered a buyback to increase their holdings to 28% of the total shares.

The trial court found that the offer represented a threat of "substantive coercion", and based on the ''[[Unocal v. Mesa Petroleum]]'' test, the poison pill was reasonable but the repurchase was not. The issue before the Supreme Court of Delaware was whether the repurchasing was a reasonable reaction to American General's threat.

==Judgment==
The Delaware Supreme Court found that the lower court erred in applying the Unocal standard. The court must first determine whether the defensive measure is draconian in that it has the effect of precluding or coercing shareholders choice. Only after that determination should the inquiry shift to whether the measure is within the range of reasonableness in response to the perceived threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gallardo| first = Eduardo| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Poison Pills Revisited| work = Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation | publisher = Harvard College| date = February 18, 2010| url = http://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2010/02/18/poison-pills-revisited/| format = | doi = | accessdate = 31 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wong| first = R.

[[File:V&amp;A Spiral.jpg|thumb|right|Architect's impression of The Spiral]]
The '''Victoria and Albert Museum Spiral''' (or '''V&amp;A Spiral''', or '''The Spiral''') was a proposed extension to the 19th-century London building which houses the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the world's largest museum of decorative arts. It was designed by [[Daniel Libeskind]] and the designer, artist, and writer, [[Cecil Balmond]].

'''Voter registration''' (or '''enrollment''') is the requirement that a person otherwise eligible to vote register (or enroll) on an [[electoral roll]] before they will be entitled or permitted to vote. Such enrollment may be automatic or may require application being made by the eligible voter. The rules governing registration vary between jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions have "election day registration" and others do not require registration, or may require production of evidence of entitlement to vote at time of voting. In some jurisdictions registration by those of [[voting age]] is compulsory, while in most it is optional. In jurisdictions where registration is voluntary, an effort may be made to encourage persons otherwise eligible to vote to register, in what is called as a [[voter registration drive]].

Registered persons may need to re-register or update their registration if they change residence or other relevant information. In some jurisdictions, when a person registers a change of residence with a government agency, say, for a driver's license, the government agency may forward the information to the electoral agency to automatically update the voter registration information.

Even in countries where registration is the individual's responsibility, many reformers, seeking to maximize [[voter turnout]], argue for a wider availability of the required forms, or more ease of process by having more places where they can register. The United States, for example, the ''[[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]]'' ("Motor Voter Law") and similar laws require states to offer voter registration at [[Department of Motor Vehicles|motor vehicle departments]] ([[driver's license]] offices) as well as disability centers, [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], and [[Public library|public libraries]], in order to offer more access to the system. State authorities are also required to accept mail-in voter registrations. Many jurisdictions also offer online registrations.

==Same-day voter registration or Election Day registration==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=April 2016}}
{{see also|Voter registration in the United States}}
In the United States, states generally require voter registration. Some U.S. states do not require advance registration, instead allowing voters to register when they arrive at the polls, in what is called ''same day registration'' or ''election day registration''. [[North Dakota]] is the only state which has no registration requirement.

Same-day registration (SDR) has been linked to higher voter turn-out, with SDR states reporting average turn-out of 71% in the [[2012 United States Presidential election]], well above the average voter turn-out rate of 59% for non-SDR states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.demos.org/blog/new-report-higher-voter-turnout-linked-sdr|title=New Report: Higher Voter Turnout Linked to SDR|author=Timpe, Brenden|publisher=[[Demos (U.S. think tank)]]|date=2013-03-14|accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects and controversy==
Registration laws making it harder for voters to register [[correlation|correlate]] strongly with lower percentages of people [[voter turnout|turning out to vote]] where voting is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;For the U.S, see Julianna Pacheco and Eric Plutzer, [http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/political_science/state_politics/conferences/2007/papers/Plutzer-Pacheco%20SPPC%20Paper.pdf "How State Electoral Institutions Influence the Electoral Participation of Young Citizens"], Department of Political Science, Penn State University, 2007, i + 18 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically in the United States, the southern states of the former Confederacy passed new constitutions and laws at the turn of the century that created barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, and complicated record keeping requirements. In practice, in their system of [[Jim Crow Laws|Jim Crow]], these elements were used to disenfranchise most African Americans and many poor whites from voting, excluding thousands of people in each state from the political system. The minority of white Democrats in these states controlled the political process and elections, gaining outsize power locally and in Congress as the [[Solid South]]. The states maintained such exclusion of most African Americans for more than 60 years. Other minority groups have also been discriminated against by other states at various times in voter registration practices, such as Native Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and other language minorities.

Because of this history, voter registration laws and practices in the United States have been closely scrutinized by interest groups and the federal government, especially following passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. It authorized federal oversight of jurisdictions with a history of under-representation of certain portions of their populations in voting. Such laws are often{{quantify|date=February 2016}} controversial. Some{{who|date=February 2016}} advocate for their abolition, while others argue that the laws should be reformed, for instance: to allow voters to register on the day of the election. Several [[United States of America|US]] states - Connecticut, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming - have adopted this approach, called [[Election Day Registration]]. For the 2012 election year, California joined this list.{{fact|date=September 2012}}

==Registration of voters internationally==
Systems of voter registration vary widely from country to country, and sometimes among lower jurisdictions, such as states or provinces. In some nations, voters are automatically added to the rolls when they reach legal voting age. In others, potential voters are required to apply to be added to the rolls.

===Australia===
The [[Australian Electoral Commission]] maintains Australia's federal [[electoral roll]]. Each state also has its own electoral commission or office, but voters need to register only with the AEC, which shares the registration details with the relevant state electoral commission. Voter registration is mandatory for all citizens 18 years of age or above. The AEC monitors house and apartment sales and sends a reminder (and the forms) to new residents if they have moved to another electorate, making compliance with the law easier.

===Canada===
In Canada, the task of enumeration was handled until 1992 by the relevant elections bureau, such as [[Elections Canada]] for the federal level. The task was delegated to temporary employees from the public, who were charged with going to each residence in assigned areas to determine the eligible voters to be recorded for a publicly displayed list for each election. The Parliament discontinued this system for fiscal reasons in the 1990s in favour of an opt-in process, by which voters mark their consent to be added the national voters list, or register, on their annual [[Tax return (Canada)|income tax return]]s. Although this allows the list to be updated annually, complaints are registered that there are excessive numbers of omissions of residents, which needlessly complicates voting for the public and is contributing to a serious decline in the percentage of the population who vote.

The Register is also updated using the following sources:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=faq&amp;document=faqvoting&amp;lang=e&amp;textonly=false#voting4|title=Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=4 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610031102/http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=faq&amp;document=faqvoting&amp;lang=e&amp;textonly=false#voting4|archivedate=10 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Same-day registration is also permitted.

===Chile===
Since 2012, voter registration in [[Chile]] is automatic. It is based on a database by the Civil Registry Office of Chileans and resident foreigners in possession of an identity card number, which is unique for each individual when issues and is never re-used after a person's death. All Chileans and eligible foreigners are added automatically to the electoral roll at age 17 and placed on an electoral constituency based on their last reported address with the Office. That address, known as "electoral domicile," can be different from a person's living address, if so desired. The electoral roll may contain a substantial number of persons residing abroad. Residents abroad are not allowed to vote in Chilean elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idLey=18556|title=LEY-18556 01-OCT-1986 MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|author=|date=1 October 1986|website=leychile.cl|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407124447/http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idLey=18556|archivedate=7 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===
All citizens and residents are included in the national register. Each person is assigned a personal identification number that includes the person's date of birth and is divisible by 11.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Denmark===
All citizens and residents of [[Denmark]] are included in the national register, ''[[Det Centrale Personregister]].'' Each person is assigned a [[Personal identification number (Denmark)|personal number]] of ten digits, which include the person's date of birth. The register is used for tax lists, voter lists, membership in the [[universal health care]] system, official record of residence, and other purposes. All eligible voters receive a card in the mail before each election which shows the date, time and local polling place; it may only be presented at the designated local polling station. Only citizens may vote in national elections, while long-time residents may vote in local and regional elections. Permanent address within Denmark is required in order to vote. Voting is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Folketing (Parliamentary) Elections Act|url=http://elections.sim.dk/media/10506/consolidated-act-parliament-elections-incl-chapt2-2014.pdf|website=Ministry of Social Affairs and the Interior|accessdate=7 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107155920/http://elections.sim.dk/media/10506/consolidated-act-parliament-elections-incl-chapt2-2014.pdf|archivedate=7 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
Voter registration in [[Finland]] is automatic and based on the national population register. Each citizen is assigned a [[National identification number#Finland|identification number]] at birth. Permanent residents are recorded in this register even if they are not citizens, and their citizenship status is indicated in the register. People in the register are legally obliged to notify the register keeper of changes of address. Changing the address in the register automatically notifies all other public bodies (for example the tax district for local taxation, the social security authorities, the conscription authorities) and certain trusted private ones (e.g. banks and insurance companies), making the process of moving residence very simple. Close to election time, the government mails a notification to registered persons informing them of the election and where and when to cast their votes. Only citizens may vote in national elections, but all residents may vote in local elections. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vaalit.fi/en/right-to-vote-and-compilation-of-the-voting-register|title=Right to Vote and Compilation of the voting register|website=Vaalit|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
All permanent residents of Germany are required to register their place of residence (or the fact that they are homeless) with local government. Citizens who will be 18 or older on the day of voting will automatically receive a notification card in the mail some weeks before any election in which they are eligible to vote: for local elections, resident citizens of other EU countries will also receive these cards and may vote. For European elections, citizens of other EU countries have to register separately. Polling places have lists of all eligible voters resident in the neighborhood served by the particular station; the voter's notification card (or photo ID such as an identity card, passport or driving license, if the notification card is not at hand) is checked against these lists before individuals receive a ballot. Voting is not compulsory.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong all permanent residents who are above 18 years of age and do not suffer from a mental illness can register as voters. Imprisoned people can also register and vote since the laws prohibiting them from voting was ruled unconstitutional in 2009 and are able to vote since mid-2010 as the electoral roll is updated annually.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The registration process is voluntary. In 2002 around 1.6 million permanent residents did not register.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legco.gov.hk/yr02-03/english/panels/ca/minutes/ca030317.pdf|title=Paragraph 9|author=Legislative Council|accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceland===
All citizens of Iceland are registered in a central database at birth, which is maintained by [[Registers Iceland]]. They do not need to register separately to vote.

===India===
The Government of India conducts a revision of the voters list every 5 years. An additional summary revision is conducted every year. Apart from this, citizens can request their inclusion in the voters list by applying through Form 6. If the application is valid, the applicant's name will get included in the list.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} At 18 years old, completed person should be eligible for voter list (for Indian citizens only).

===Israel===
In Israel, all citizens who are 18 years of age or older on election day are automatically registered to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/State/Democracy/Pages/FAQ_Elections_Israel.aspx "FAQ: Elections in Israel."] Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In Italy, all [[municipality|municipalities]] have a registry of residents and a registry of eligible voters.This is revised every six months and whenever there is an election. The registry of eligible voters can be viewed by anyone to ensure maximum transparency in the electoral process.&lt;ref&gt;Making electoral operations public ( ... ) gives a supervisory role and participation to the candidate, the party representatives and, albeit in a milder form, the same voters: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title=Elezioni contestate, analisi voto per voto sulla volontà dell'elettore|journal=Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online|date=2000|url=https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89298453|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324160801/https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89298453|archivedate=24 March 2016|df=dmy-all}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; All citizens aged 18 or more on the election day are automatically registered to vote.

===Mexico===
[[File:MexicoVoterID.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Voter ID card from Mexico.]]

[[Mexico]] has a general electoral census. Any citizen of age 18 or greater must go to an electoral office in order be registered into the electoral census. Citizens receive a voting card (''credencial de elector con fotografía''), issued by the National Electoral Institute (INE) (from 1990 until 4/2014 it was called [[Federal Electoral Institute]]) that must be shown to vote in any election. The voting card also serves as a national identity document.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Norway===
All citizens and residents of [[Norway]] are included in the national register, ''Folkeregisteret'', where each person is assigned a personal number of eleven digits which include the person's date of birth. The register is used for tax lists, voter lists, membership in the universal health care system and other purposes, and it is maintained by the tax authorities. All eligible voters receive a card in the mail before each election which shows the date, time and local polling place. Only citizens may vote in national elections, while longtime residents may vote in local and regional elections. Voting is not compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2002-06-28-57/#KAPITTEL_2 Valgloven §2], (Norwegian.) "Stemmerett" means right to vote while "stemmeplikt" means that voting is compulsory.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peru===
All citizens of Peru between 18 and 70 years are [[Electoral system of Peru|registered to vote]] through the [[National Registry of Identification and Civil Status]], except all members of [[National Police of Peru|the police]] and [[Peruvian Armed Forces|the armed forces]], who are not allowed to participate in elections. For all citizens in the country and abroad voting is mandatory, unless legally exempted. Failing to vote in the election of 7 Oct 2018 was fined with S/ 83, with 50% or 75% discount for areas with poverty or extreme poverty, and this must be paid to get access to many public services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.efe.com/efe/english/world/more-than-23-mn-peruvians-head-to-polls-elect-local-regional-officials/50000262-3773864 Peru: voting is obligatory]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
{{main article|Voter registration in the Philippines}}
{{summarize|from|Voter registration in the Philippines|section=y|date=October 2016}}

===South Korea===
There is no formal process for voter registration for South Korean citizens. All citizens will be automatically listed in the voters' list upon each election date. A domestic in-absentee vote was ceased and citizens can visit any residents' center (주민센터) and vote in advance during the weekend before the actual election date.

However, citizens either temporary visiting or permanently residing abroad must register for an overseas in-absentee ballot in order to vote. Voting can be done in Korean overseas missions.

===Sweden===
Voter registration in Sweden is automatic and based on the national population register, [[Population registration in Sweden|Folkbokföringsregistret]], administered by the [[Swedish Tax Agency]], where all citizens and residents of Sweden are included. Each person is assigned a ten digit [[national identification number]], which include the person's date of birth. The register is used for [[Taxation in Sweden|tax lists]], voter lists, membership in the universal [[Healthcare in Sweden|health care system]], [[Social security in Sweden|public insurance]], official record of residence, and other purposes. Permanent residents shall be recorded in this register even if they are not citizens but enjoy right of residence, and their citizenship status is indicated in the register. Changing the address in the central register automatically notifies all other public bodies (for example the tax district for local taxation, the [[Swedish Social Insurance Agency|social security authorities]], the [[Conscription in Sweden|conscription authorities]]) and certain trusted private ones (e.g. banks and insurance companies), making the administration of a move of residence very simple. 

All eligible voters receive a letter in the mail to their registered address of 30 days prior to election day, in Sweden or abroad, which shows the date, time and local polling place, always on a Sunday, normally in September each 4 years. Polling may also be done anywhere in the country at various [[early voting]] stations determined by the local Election Committee or at a Swedish [[Diplomatic mission]], all to facilitate for the voters. To vote in person a recognized photo identity document is required, or a confirmation by someone with proper identification. The voting card letter is not compulsory to bring as it is possible to print a copy of it, but it reduces waiting time. For people with difficulties to move, like elderly, hospitalized or imprisoned, there are ambulant voting stations and the possibility to vote as an [[absentee_voting|absentee]] through a [[proxy_voting|proxy]], that can be a family member, caretaker, prison guard or other person in a normal relationship with the voter. Those living on the country-side can vote with their postman and those staying abroad are allowed to vote through mail with the material provided by a diplomatic mission. Elections through [[internet_voting|Internet]] are not yet implemented, although most other registry related services are available, like leaving a [[tax return]]. The Local Election Committee, that manages the electoral roll and oversees safe vote counting and reporting, is appointed by each [[County administrative boards of Sweden|County Administrative Board]] and all work is transparent, as Swedish authorities by default must follow the [[Open government|principle of transparency]], but the actual vote of each individual is kept [[Secret_ballot|secret]]. All [[Absentee ballot|absentee]] and early voting ballots are sent physically to the registered local polling station for counting and double checking the voter's identity with the [[electoral roll]] eliminating any risk of double voting.

Only Swedish citizens being 18 years old on the election day and living in Sweden may vote in all public elections. Registered residents may vote in [[Municipal council (Sweden)|local]] and [[County councils of Sweden|regional]] elections. Swedish citizens that are resident abroad have the right to vote in [[parliament|Riksdag]] and [[Elections to the European Parliament|EU elections]] only. To maintain a record in the electoral roll as an [[expatriate]], one needs to refresh the registration within 10 years; a vote counts as a valid refresh. In the elections for political members of the Church Board ([[Parochial church council]]), similar elections are held, but only members of the [[Church of Sweden]] above 16 years of age have [[suffrage]]. [[Universal suffrage|Universal egalitarian]] voting rights are protected by the [[Basic Laws of Sweden|constitution]]; all voting is voluntary and free of charge, but often seen as a duty, with [[voter turnout]] between 80 and 90% in the last decades. It is possible to change an early vote, on the election day, thus scrapping a previously sent vote. By Swedish law, the elections are [[Direct election|direct]] and [[Proportional representation|proportional]], which means that the actual votes are reflected in each party's share of the 349 of representatives in the [[parliament|Riksdag]], but each individual enter according to amount of personal votes. Any mismatch between districts that could skew the proportion is managed through the [[Leveling seat]]s, rendering no votes powerless if placed on a party that can enter the parliament. The eligibility to the governing bodies follow the same limitations as for the voting. Through the use of [[Protest vote|blank]] (1,09% in [[Swedish general election, 2010|2010 Parliament elections]]) and unlocked ballots to allow total democracy and voting for unregistered parties, people that were not even running for office have been elected to municipal boards when their name has been handwritten on ballots raising controversy, thus the rules are being changed to disqualify ballots for a person that does not approve or is disapproved by the party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.val.se/servicelankar/other-languages/english-engelska/the-swedish-electoral-system.html The Swedish electoral system]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{Main article|Voting in Switzerland}}

All citizens and residents of Switzerland are required to register with the municipal authorities at their place of residence. Voter registration is automatic for citizens; the government sends out ballots by mail a few weeks before an election or referendum.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the UK voter registration is compulsory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/electoral-register/|title=Electoral register|author=|date=20 May 2016|website=ico.org.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427124800/https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/electoral-register/|archivedate=27 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the requirement to register is rarely enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpolcon/938/93808.htm|title=House of Commons - Voter engagement in the UK: follow up - Political and Constitutional Reform|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Commons|date=|website=publications.parliament.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026120856/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpolcon/938/93808.htm|archivedate=26 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current{{when|date=February 2015}} system of registration in the United Kingdom (UK), introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]], is known as [[rolling registration]]. Electors can register with a [[local authority]] at any time of the year. This replaced the twice-yearly census of electors, which often disenfranchised those who had moved during the interval between censuses.

Across the country, the registration of electors is still technically the responsibility of the [[head of household]], a concept which some consider to be anachronistic in modern society. This current{{when|date=February 2015}} system is controversial, as it is possible for one person to delete persons who live with them from the electoral roll. As of January 2012, mandatory individual registration, pursuant to the [[Political Parties and Elections Act 2009]], was anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Individual voter ID plan brought forward to 2014|date=15 September 2010|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11312362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A feasibility study for electronic individual voter registration (IVR), based on the experience of other nations, was undertaken by EURIM (Information Society Alliance) in 2010. The final report was released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=INDIVIDUAL VOTER REGISTRATION – LESSONS FROM OVERSEAS|url=http://www.eurim.org.uk/activities/ig/1103-IVR_LessonsFromOverseas.pdf|work=Information Governance Individual Voter Registration Subgroup Status Report|publisher=EURIM (Information Society Alliance)|accessdate=9 June 2012|author=EURIM|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the House of Commons Hansard from 16 January 2012, the IVR initiative is yet to be implemented in the UK. There was discussion of data from Northern Ireland, where individual voter registration levels significantly decreased following the introduction of an IVR policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Daily Hansard – Debate 16 Jan 2012 : Column 451|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120116/debtext/120116-0001.htm|work=parliament.co.uk|publisher=Parliament|accessdate=9 June 2012|author=Staff|date=16 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426042037/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120116/debtext/120116-0001.htm|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an experiment in [[Northern Ireland]] using personal identifiers, such as [[National Insurance]] numbers and signatures, the number of registered electors fell by some ten thousand. It was also understood that the new process may have resulted in fictitious voters being dropped from rolls.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Registration is mandatory pursuant to section 23 of the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/341/regulation/23/made Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 (No. 341)] and violators are liable on [[summary offence|summary conviction]] and face a maximum [[fine (penalty)|fine]] of £1,000. Voters must be on the [[electoral roll]] in order to vote in national, local or European elections. A fixed address is required in order for an individual to vote in an election. To provide for persons who are transient, if an individual lacking a fixed address wants to vote, they may register by filling in a 'Declaration of local connection' form. This establishes a connection to the area based on the last fixed address someone had, or the place where they spend a substantial amount of their time (e.g. a homeless shelter).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register_to_vote/no_fixed_address.aspx|title=No fixed address|author=The Electoral Commission|accessdate=4 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806094848/http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register_to_vote/no_fixed_address.aspx|archivedate=6 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A voting card is sent to each registrant shortly before any elections. The individual does not need to take the card to the polling station, instead it serves to remind individuals of the details they had provided to the electoral register.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/how_do_i_vote/voting_in_person.asp|title=Voting in person|author=The Electoral Commission|accessdate=4 August 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voter registration in the United States takes place at the [[county (United States)|county]] level, and is a prerequisite to voting at federal, state and local elections. The only exception is [[North Dakota]], although North Dakota law allows cities to register voters for city elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/elections/voter-registration/ND#.WCFO5NxXQSQ|title=The Voter's Self Defense System|author=|date=|website=Vote Smart|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108134214/http://votesmart.org/elections/voter-registration/ND#.WCFO5NxXQSQ|archivedate=8 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nd.gov/sos/electvote/voting/vote-history.html|title=Voter Registration in North Dakota|author=Secretary of State North Dakota|accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study by [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] estimates that 24% of the voting-eligible population in the United States are not registered to vote, a percentage that represents "at least 51 million eligible U.S. citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] forbade such abuses and authorized federal oversight in jurisdictions of historic under-representation of certain groups. States continue to develop new practices that may discriminate against certain populations. By August 2016, federal rulings in five cases have overturned all or parts of voter registration or [[voter ID laws]] in Ohio, Texas, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and North Dakota that were found to place undue burden on minorities and other groups among voters.&lt;ref name="supreme.watch"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/19/politics/voting-rights-supreme-court/ Ariane de Vogue, "Voting challenges head toward the Supreme Court: 4 cases to watch"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725205010/http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/19/politics/voting-rights-supreme-court/ |date=25 July 2016 }}, CNN, 19 July 2016; accessed 30 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="id"&gt;"Voter ID Laws Take a Beating in U.S. Courts", ''New York Times,'' 30 July 2016, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wapost"&gt;{{cite news |author=Rober Barnes |title=Federal judge blocks N.

While voters traditionally had to register at government offices by a certain period before an election, in the mid-1990s, the federal government made efforts to simplify registration procedures to improve access and increase [[Voter turnout|turnout]]. The [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]] (the "Motor Voter" law) required state governments to ''either'' provide uniform opt-in registration services through drivers' license registration centers, disability centers, schools, libraries, and mail-in registration, ''or'' to allow voter registration on Election Day, where voters can register at polling places immediately prior to voting. From January 1, 2016, Oregon was the first state to adopt a fully automatic (opt-out) voter registration system as part of the process of issuing driver licenses and ID cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sos.oregon.gov/voting/Pages/motor-voter-faq.aspx|title=Oregon Secretary of State: Oregon Motor Voter Act FAQ|author=|date=|website=sos.oregon.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416022710/http://sos.oregon.gov/voting/Pages/motor-voter-faq.aspx|archivedate=16 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2016 three more states - California, West Virginia, and Vermont - followed suit, and in May 2016 Connecticut implemented it administratively rather than by legislation, bringing the number of states with automatic voter registration to five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Westermann Verlag''' (English: "Westermann Publishing") is a [[Germany|German]] [[publishing firm]], founded in the 19th century in [[Braunschweig]], [[Duchy of Brunswick]] by [[George Westermann]] (23 February 1810 in [[Leipzig]];  7 September 1879 in Wiesbaden). Several other generations of the Westermann family succeeded him.

In 1986, the "Westermann Druck- und Verlagsgruppe" in Braunschweig, comprising numerous branches, became part of [[Medien-Union]] based in [[Ludwigshafen]], employing 800.

Westermann is renowned for its meticulous world history-atlas in German, the ''Großer Atlas zur Weltgeschichte'', generally known as "the Westermann".

For use in schools, they continue to publish the ''[[Carl Diercke]] Schul-Atlas'', a series started in the 19th century, since called ''[[Diercke]] Weltatlas''. They also offer products related to or using [[Google Earth]], 3D-technology, and globes.
