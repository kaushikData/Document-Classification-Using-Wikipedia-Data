      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24625">In the 19th century, the theory of the [[luminiferous aether]] as the hypothetical [[Transmission medium|medium]] for the propagation of light was widely discussed. An important part of this discussion was the question concerning the state of motion of Earth with respect to this medium. The '''aether drag hypothesis''' dealt with the question whether the luminiferous aether is dragged by or entrained within moving matter. According to the first variant no relative motion exists between Earth and aether; according to the second one, relative motion exists and thus the [[speed of light]] should depend on the speed of this motion ("aether wind"), which should be measurable by instruments at rest on Earth's surface. Specific aether models were invented by [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] who in 1818 proposed that the aether is partially entrained by matter. The other one was proposed by [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Stokes]] in 1845, in which the aether is completely entrained within or in the vicinity of matter.

While Fresnel's almost stationary theory was apparently confirmed by the [[Fizeau experiment]] (1851), Stokes' theory was apparently confirmed by the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] (1881, 1887). This contradictory situation was resolved by the works of [[Hendrik Antoon Lorentz]] (1895, 1904) whose [[Lorentz ether theory]] banished any form of aether dragging, and finally with the work of [[Albert Einstein]] (1905) whose theory of [[special relativity]] doesn't contain the aether as a mechanical medium at all.

==Partial aether dragging==
In 1810, [[François Arago]] realised that variations in the refractive index of a substance predicted by the corpuscular theory would provide a useful method for measuring the velocity of light. These predictions arose because the [[refractive index]] of a substance such as glass depends on the ratio of the velocities of light in air and in the glass. Arago attempted to measure the extent to which corpuscles of light would be refracted by a glass prism at the front of a telescope. He expected that there would be a range of different angles of refraction due to the variety of different velocities of the stars and the motion of the earth at different times of the day and year. Contrary to this expectation he found that there was no difference in refraction between stars, between times of day or between seasons. All Arago observed was ordinary [[Aberration of light|stellar aberration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author =Arago, A.|title=Mémoire sur la vitesse de la lumière, lu à la prémière classe de l’Institut, le 10 décembre 1810|journal=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences |volume=36|year=1810–1853|pages=38–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1818, [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] examined Arago's results using a wave theory of light. He realised that even if light were transmitted as waves the refractive index of the glass-air interface should have varied as the glass moved through the aether to strike the incoming waves at different velocities when the earth rotated and the seasons changed. Fresnel proposed that the glass prism would carry some of the aether along with it so that "..the aether is in excess inside the prism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author =Fresnel, A.|title=Lettre d'Augustin Fresnel à François Arago sur l'influence du mouvement terrestre dans quelques phénomènes d'optique|journal=Annales de chimie et de physique|volume=9|year=1818|pages=57–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He realised that the velocity of propagation of waves depends on the density of the medium so proposed that the velocity of light in the prism would need to be adjusted by an amount of 'drag'. The velocity of light &lt;math&gt; v_n&lt;/math&gt; in the glass without any adjustment is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; v_n = \frac{c}{n} &lt;/math&gt;

The drag adjustment &lt;math&gt; v_d&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; v_d  = v (1 - \frac {\rho_e}{\rho_g}) &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \rho_e&lt;/math&gt; is the aether density in the environment, &lt;math&gt;\rho_g&lt;/math&gt; is the aether density in the glass and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the prism with respect to the aether.

The factor &lt;math&gt;(1 - \frac {\rho_e}{\rho_g})&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt; (1 - \frac{1}{n^2})&lt;/math&gt; because the refractive index, n, would be dependent on the density of the aether. This is known as the ''Fresnel drag coefficient''. The velocity of light in the glass is then given by:

:&lt;math&gt; V = \frac {c}{n} + v (1 - \frac{1}{n^2}) &lt;/math&gt;

This correction was successful in explaining the null result of Arago's experiment. It introduces the concept of a largely stationary aether that is dragged by substances such as glass but not by air. Its success favoured the wave theory of light over the previous corpuscular theory.

===Problems of partial aether dragging===
Fresnel's dragging coefficient was directly confirmed by the [[Fizeau experiment]] and its repetitions. In general, with the aid of this coefficient the negative result of all optical aether drift experiments sensitive enough to detect ''first'' order effects (such as the [[Luminiferous aether#First order experiments|experiments of Arago, Fizeau, Hoek, Airy, Mascart]]) can be explained. The notion of an (almost) stationary aether is also consistent with [[stellar aberration]]. However, this theory is considered to be refuted for the following reasons:&lt;ref name=whit /&gt;&lt;ref name=jann /&gt;&lt;ref name=ferr /&gt;

* It was already known in the 19th century, that partial aether dragging requires the relative velocity of aether and matter to be different for light of different colours – which is evidently not the case.
* Fresnel's theory of an (almost) stationary aether predicts ''positive'' results by experiments which are sensitive enough to detect second order effects. However, experiments such as the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] and the [[Trouton–Noble experiment]], gave ''negative'' results within their margin of error and are therefore considered refutations of Fresnel's aether.

==Complete aether dragging==
For [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Stokes]] (1845) the model of an aether which is totally unaffected or only partially affected by moving matter was unnatural and unconvincing, so he assumed that the aether is completely dragged within and in the vicinity of matter, partially dragged at larger distances, and stays at rest in free space.&lt;ref name=stokes1845&gt;{{Citation|author =Stokes, George Gabriel|title=[[s:On the Aberration of Light|On the Aberration of Light]]|journal=Philosophical Magazine|volume=27|year=1845|pages=9–15|doi=10.1080/14786444508645215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stokes1846&gt;{{Citation|author =Stokes, George Gabriel|title=[[s:On Fresnel's Theory of the Aberration of Light|On Fresnel's Theory of the Aberration of Light]]|journal=Philosophical Magazine|volume=28|year=1846|pages=76–81|doi=10.1080/14786444608645365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author =Stokes, George Gabriel|title=[[s:On the Constitution of the Luminiferous Æther|On the Constitution of the Luminiferous Æther, viewed with reference to the phænomenon of the Aberration of Light]]|journal=Philosophical Magazine|volume=29|year=1846|pages=6–10|doi=10.1080/14786444608562589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author =Stokes, George Gabriel|title=[[s:On the Constitution of the Luminiferous Æther II|On the Constitution of the Luminiferous Æther]]|journal=Philosophical Magazine|volume=32|year=1848|pages=343–349|doi=10.1080/14786444808645996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]] (1890) incorporated a complete aether drag model within his elaboration of Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, to bring it into accord with the Galilean [[principle of relativity]]. That is, if it is assumed that the aether is at rest within matter in one reference frame, the [[Galilean transformation]] gives the result that matter and (entrained) aether travel with the same speed in another frame of reference.&lt;ref name=whit /&gt;

===Problems of complete aether dragging===
[[File:Sir Oliver Lodge's ether machine.png|thumb|175px|Lodge's ether machine. Light from a sensitive common path interferometer was guided between the rapidly rotating disks.]]
Complete aether dragging can explain the negative outcome of all aether drift experiments (like the Michelson–Morley experiment). However, this theory is considered to be wrong for the following reasons:&lt;ref name=whit /&gt;&lt;ref name=joos&gt;[[Georg Joos]]: ''Lehrbuch der theoretischen Physik.'' 12. edition, 1959, page 448&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Fizeau experiment]] (1851) indicated only a partial entrainment of light.
* The [[Sagnac effect]] shows that two rays of light, emanated from the same light source in different directions on a rotating platform, require different times to come back to the light source. However, if the aether is completely dragged by the platform this effect should not occur at all.
* [[Oliver Lodge]] conducted experiments in the 1890s, seeking evidence that the propagation of light is influenced by being in the proximity of large rotating masses, and found no such influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author =Lodge, Oliver J.|title=Aberration Problems|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]]|volume=184|year=1893|pages=727–804|doi=10.1098/rsta.1893.0015|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k559898/f781|bibcode = 1893RSPTA.184..727L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author =Lodge, Oliver J.|title=[[s:en:Experiments on the Absence of Mechanical Connexion between Ether and Matter|Experiments on the Absence of Mechanical Connexion between Ether and Matter]]|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]]|volume=189|year=1897|pages=149–166|bibcode = 1897RSPTA.189..149L |doi = 10.1098/rsta.1897.0006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Hammar experiment]], conducted by [[Gustaf Wilhelm Hammar]] in 1935, a [[common path interferometer]] was used. Massive lead blocks were installed on both sides of only one leg of the interferometer. This arrangement should cause different amounts of aether drag and therefore produce a positive result. However, the result was again negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author= G. W. Hammar| year= 1935| title= The Velocity of Light Within a Massive Enclosure| journal= Physical Review| volume= 48| issue= 5| pages= 462&amp;ndash;463| doi= 10.1103/PhysRev.48.462.2 |bibcode =1935PhRv...48..462H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stellar aberration versus the dragged aether.gif|thumb|250px|Complete aether dragging is inconsistent with the phenomenon of stellar aberration. In this illustration, imagine the stars to be infinitely distant. Aberration occurs when the observer's velocity has a component that is perpendicular to the line traveled by the light incoming from the star. As seen in the animation on the left, the telescope must be tilted before the star will appear in the center of the eyepiece. As seen in the animation of the right, if the aether is dragged in the vicinity of the earth, then the telescope must be pointed directly at the star for the star to appear in the center of the eyepiece.]]

* It is inconsistent with the phenomenon of [[stellar aberration]]. In stellar aberration the position of a star when viewed with a telescope swings each side of a central position by about 20.5 seconds of arc every six months. This amount of swing is the amount expected when considering the speed of earth's travel in its orbit. In 1871 [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]] demonstrated that stellar aberration occurs even when a telescope is filled with water. It seems that if the aether drag hypothesis were true then stellar aberration would not occur because the light would be travelling in the aether which would be moving along with the telescope. Consider a bucket on a train about to enter a tunnel, and a drop of water drips from the tunnel entrance into the bucket at the very center. The drop will not hit the center at the bottom of the bucket. The bucket is analogous to the tube of a telescope, the drop is a photon and the train is the earth. If aether is dragged then the droplet would be traveling with the train when it is dropped and would hit the center of bucket at the bottom. The amount of stellar aberration, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;\tan(\alpha) = \frac{v \delta t}{c \delta t}.&lt;/math&gt; So: &lt;math&gt;\tan(\alpha) = \frac{v}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

:The speed at which the earth goes round the sun, v = 30&amp;nbsp;km/s, and the speed of light is c = 299,792,458 m/s which gives &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = 20.5 seconds of arc every six months. This amount of aberration is observed and this contradicts the complete aether drag hypothesis.

===Stokes' responses to those problems===
Stokes already in 1845 introduced some additional assumptions in order to bring his theory into accord with experimental results. To explain aberration, he assumed that his incompressible aether is irrotational as well, which would give, in connection with his specific model of aether drag, the correct law of aberration.&lt;ref name=stokes1845 /&gt; To reproduce Fresnel's dragging coefficient (and therefore to explain the Fizeau experiment) he argued that the aether is completely dragged within a medium – ''i.e.'' the aether gets condensed when it enters the medium and rarefied when it leaves it again, which modifies the speed of the aether as well as that of light and leads to the same expression as Fresnel's.&lt;ref name=stokes1846 /&gt;

Even though Stokes' aberration theory was considered viable for some time, it had to be given up because Lorentz argued in 1886, that when the aether is incompressible as in Stokes' theory, and if the aether has the same normal component of velocity as the earth, it would not have the same tangential component of velocity, so all conditions posed by Stokes cannot be fulfilled at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author =Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon|year=1886|title=De l'influence du mouvement de la terre sur les phénomènes lumineux|journal=Archives néerlandaises des sciences exactes et naturelles|volume=21|pages=103–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gravitational aether drag===
Another version of Stokes' model was proposed by [[Theodor des Coudres]] and [[Wilhelm Wien]] (1900). They assumed that aether dragging is proportional to the gravitational mass. That is, the aether is completely dragged by the earth, and only partially dragged by smaller objects on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Wien|first=Wilhelm| year=1898 | title=[[s:de:Translatorische Bewegung des Lichtäthers|Über die Fragen, welche die translatorische Bewegung des Lichtäthers betreffen (Referat für die 70. Versammlung deutsche Naturforscher und Aerzte in Düsseldorf, 1898)]]| journal=Annalen der Physik| volume =301| issue=3| pages =I-XVIII}}.&lt;/ref&gt; And to save Stokes's explanation of aberration, [[Max Planck]] (1899) argued in a letter to Lorentz, that the aether might not be incompressible, but condensed by gravitation in the vicinity of earth, and this would give the conditions needed for the theory of Stokes ("Stokes-Planck theory"). When compared with the experiments above, this model can explain the positive results of the experiments of Fizeau and Sagnac, because the small mass of those instruments can only partially (or not at all) drag the aether, and for the same reason it explains the negative result of Lodge's experiments. It is also compatible with Hammar's and Michelson–Morley experiment, as the aether is completely dragged by the large mass of earth.

However, this theory was directly refuted by the [[Michelson–Gale–Pearson experiment]] (1925). The great difference of this experiment against the usual Sagnac experiments is the fact that the rotation of earth itself was measured. If the aether is completely dragged by the Earth's gravitational field, a negative result has to be expected - but the result was positive.&lt;ref name=joos /&gt;

And from a theoretical side it was noted by [[Hendrik Antoon Lorentz]], that the Stokes-Planck hypothesis requires that the speed of light is not affected by a density increase of 50000 times of the aether. So Lorentz and Planck himself rejected this hypothesis as improbable.&lt;ref name=whit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Lorentz, H.A. |title=Stoke's Theory of Aberration in the Supposition of a Variable Density of the Aether |pages=443–448 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |year=1899 |volume=1 |url=http://www.digitallibrary.nl/proceedings/search/detail.cfm?pubid=2413&amp;view=image&amp;startrow=1 |bibcode=1898KNAB....1..443L |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404010653/http://www.digitallibrary.nl/proceedings/search/detail.cfm?pubid=2413&amp;view=image&amp;startrow=1 |archivedate=2008-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lorentz and Einstein==
Since Lorentz was forced to abandon Stokes' hypothesis, he chose Fresnel's model as a starting point.{{citation needed | reason=This is a crucial step in the historical lineage of relativity theory|date=December 2017}} He was able to reproduce Fresnel's dragging coefficient in 1892, though in Lorentz's theory it represents a modification of the propagation of light waves, not the result of any aether entrainment. Therefore, [[Lorentz ether theory|Lorentz's aether]] is fully stationary or immobile. However, this leads to the same problem that already afflicted Fresnel's model: it stood in contradiction with the Michelson–Morley experiment. Therefore, [[George Francis FitzGerald]] (1889) and Lorentz (1892) introduced [[length contraction]], that is, all bodies contract in the line of motion by the factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, in Lorentz's theory the [[Galilean transformation]] was replaced by the [[Lorentz transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author =Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon|year=1904|title=[[s:Electromagnetic phenomena|Electromagnetic phenomena in a system moving with any velocity smaller than that of light]]|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|volume=6|pages=809–831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the accumulation of hypotheses to rescue the stationary aether concept was considered to be very artificial. So it was [[Albert Einstein]] (1905), who recognized that it is only required to assume the [[principle of relativity]] and the constancy of the speed of light in all [[inertial frame of reference|inertial frames of reference]], in order to develop the theory of [[special relativity]] and to derive the complete Lorentz transformation. All this was done without using the stationary aether concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|doi=10.1002/andp.19053221004|author =Einstein, Albert|year=1905|title=On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=322|issue=10|pages=891–921|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/|bibcode = 1905AnP...322..891E }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As shown by [[Max von Laue]] (1907), special relativity predicts the result of the Fizeau experiment from the [[velocity addition]] theorem without any need for an aether. If &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of light relative to the Fizeau apparatus and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of light relative to the water and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the water:

:&lt;math&gt; U = \frac {c}{n} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; V = \frac {c/n + v}{1 + v/nc}&lt;/math&gt;

which, if v/c is small can be expanded using the binomial expansion to become:

:&lt;math&gt; V \approx \frac {c}{n} + v \left(1 - \frac{1}{n^2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

This is identical to Fresnel's equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author =Laue, Max von|year=1907 |title=Die Mitführung des Lichtes durch bewegte Körper nach dem Relativitätsprinzip |trans-title=[[s:Translation:The Entrainment of Light by Moving Bodies in Accordance with the Principle of Relativity|The Entrainment of Light by Moving Bodies in Accordance with the Principle of Relativity]]|journal=Annalen der Physik |volume =23|pages =989–990 |doi=10.1002/andp.19073281015 |bibcode=1907AnP...328..989L

[[Maurice Allais]] proposed in 1959 an aether hypothesis involving a wind velocity of about 8&amp;nbsp;km/s, much lower than the standard value of 30&amp;nbsp;km/s supported by scientists of the nineteenth century, and compatible with the Michelson–Morley and the [[Dayton Miller]] experiments,&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;

==Summary==
In modern physics (which is based on the [[theory of relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]]), the aether as a "material substance" with a "state of motion" no longer plays any role. So questions concerning a possible "aether drag" are no longer considered meaningful by the scientific community. However, [[frame-dragging]] as predicted by [[general relativity]], in which rotating masses distort the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|spacetime metric]], causing a [[precession]] of the orbit of nearby particles, does exist. But this effect is orders of magnitude weaker than any "aether drag" discussed in this article.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3948">An '''algebraic Petri net (APN)''' is an evolution of the well known '''[[Petri net]]''' in which elements of '''user defined data types''' (called '''algebraic abstract data types (AADT)'''&lt;ref&gt;Ehrig, H. and Mahr, B. 1985 Fundamentals of Algebraic Specification I. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;) replace black tokens. This formalism can be compared to coloured Petri nets (CPN)&lt;ref&gt;K. Jensen. Coloured Petri Nets. Springer, Berlin, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; in many aspects. However, in the APN case, the semantics of the data types is given by an axiomatization enabling proofs and computations on it.

'''Algebraic Petri nets'''&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Vautherin: Parallel systems specifications with [[Coloured Petri nets]] and algebraic specifications. European Workshop on Applications and Theory of Petri Nets 1986: 293-308&lt;/ref&gt; were invented by Jacques Vautherin in 85 in his PhD thesis and later improved by Wolfang Reisig.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Reisig: Petri Nets and Algebraic Specifications. Theor. Comput. Sci. 80(1): 1-34 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The formalism has two aspects :
* The control part which is handled by a Petri net.
* The data part which is handled by one or many AADTs.

AADT can be themselves split in two parts: 
* The '''signature''' (Sort and Ops in the example below) which gives the valid constants and operations of the [[term algebra]].
* The '''axiomatization''' (Axioms in the example below) which gives the semantics of the operations described in the signature part.

The following picture describes an algebraic Petri net model of the "[[dining philosophers problem]]". There are two '''AADT''' in this model, one for the forks algebra, one for the philosophers algebra. Please note that the philosophers AADT uses the fork AADT. Since all philosophers can take their left fork without taking their right fork, executing this model can result in a '''deadlock'''.

The control part is composed of :
* '''Places''' contain '''[[multiset]]''' (bags) of tokens. Those tokens are elements of a [[term algebra]] built upon the signature of the '''AADT'''(in the example, terms that represent either a philosopher or a fork). Each place contains one and only one multiset of terms, the place is typed by its multiset.
*'''Arcs''' can be labeled with multisets of either closed or free terms. Again terms are built from the AADT signature.
* '''Transitions''' are events that can be fired whenever there are enough resources (namely enough tokens in the input places to satisfy all the input arcs) and the guard (firing conditions) of the transition holds. Then the produced tokens are put in the target places of the output arcs. Usually term [[rewriting]]&lt;ref&gt;Dick, A. J. and Watson, P. 1991. Order-sorted term rewriting. Comput. J. 34, 1 (Feb. 1991), 16-19.&lt;/ref&gt; is used for the operational semantics in order to check if conditions hold and to compute output terms.

In the example below only transition '''goEat''' is firable at the beginning. One '''goEat''' has been fired, '''takeL''' and '''takeR''' are also enabled and thus can also be fired.
&lt;br/&gt;

Algebraic Petri nets are the basic formalism of more advanced ones such as [[CO-OPN]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">An '''aretology''' (from ancient Greek [[arete (moral virtue)|aretê]], "excellence, virtue") in the strictest sense is a narrative about a divine figure's miraculous deeds. In the [[Greco-Roman world]], aretologies represent a religious branch of [[rhetoric]] and are a prose development of the [[hymn]] as praise poetry. [[Asclepius]], [[Isis]], and [[Serapis]] are among the deities with surviving aretologies in the form of [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] and [[papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Pernot, ''Rhetoric in Antiquity,'' translated by W.E. Higgins (Catholic University of America Press, 2005), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ''aretologos'' (ἀρετολόγος, "virtue-speaker") was a temple official who recounted aretologies and may have also interpreted dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, an aretology is also a "catalogue of virtues" belonging to a person; for example, [[Cicero]]'s list and description of the virtues of [[Pompey the Great|Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great")]] in the speech ''[[Pro Lege Manilia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Rees, "Panegyric," in "''A Companion to Roman Rhetoric'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Aretology became part of the Christian rhetorical tradition of [[hagiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter, ''The Warrior Saints,'' p. 17; Alistair Stewart-Sykes, ''From Prophecy to Preaching: A Search for the Origins of the Christian Homily'' (Brill, 2001), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an even more expanded sense, aretology is [[moral philosophy]] which deals with [[virtue]], its nature, and the means of arriving at it.{{cn|date=December 2012}} It is the title of an ethical tract by [[Robert Boyle]] published in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Harwood, ''The Early Essays and Ethics of Robert Boyle'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1991), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rigid social designators remain fixed throughout an individual's life and are inseparable from the positive or negative stereotypes that are linked with one's ascribed statuses.

The practice of assigning such statuses to individuals exists cross-culturally within all societies and is based on gender, race, family origins, and ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;These rigid social designators remain fixed throughout an individual's life and are inseparable from the positive or negative stereotypes that are linked with one's ascribed statuses.

The practice of assigning such statuses to individuals exists cross-culturally within all societies and are based on gender, race, family origins, and ethnic backgrounds.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person born into a wealthy family has a high ascribed status based solely on the [[social network]]s and economic advantages that one gains from being born into a family with more resources than others.

In contrast, an [[achieved status]] is a social position a person takes on voluntarily that reflects both personal ability and merit.  An individual's occupation tends to fall under the category of an achieved status; for example, a teacher or a firefighter.

Individuals have control over their achieved statuses insofar as there are no restrictions associated with their ascribed statuses that could potentially hinder their social growth.  Ascribed status plays an important role in societies because it can provide the members with a defined and unified identity.  No matter where an individual's ascribed status may place him or her in the social hierarchy, most has a set of roles and expectations that are directly linked to each ascribed status and thus, provides a social personality.

==Factors==
The various factors that determine ascribed status are [[Ageing|age]] (as in [[age stratification]]), [[kinship]], [[sex]], [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[social group]] and [[caste]].

In addition to ascription, at birth there are also:
* Delayed Ascription (when social status is given at a later stage of life)
* Fluid Ascription (when ascribed status leads to an achieved status)

==Reversible and irreversible==
The anthropologist, [[Ralph Linton]], developed definitions for ascribed status and achieved status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Linton
  | first = Ralph
  | authorlink = Ralph Linton
  | title = The Study of Man: An Introduction
  | publisher = Appleton-Century-Crofts, Inc.
  | year = 1936
  | location = New York
  | pages = 
  | url = https://archive.org/details/studyofman031904mbp
  | doi = 
  | id = 
  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Linton, ascribed status is assigned to an individual without reference to their innate differences or abilities. Achieved status is determined by an individual's performance or effort. Linton noted that while the definitions of the two concepts are clear and distinct, it is not always easy to identify whether an individual's status is ascribed or achieved. His perspective offers a deviation from the view that ascribed statuses are always fixed.

Religion is generally perceived as an ascribed status but for those individuals who choose a religion as an adult, or convert to another religion, their religion becomes an achieved status, based on Linton's definition.  It is commonly perceived that ascribed statuses are irreversible while achieved statuses are reversible.  Linton uses Leo Schnore's research to illustrate how ascribed statuses can be both irreversible and reversible.  An example of an ascribed reversible status is the status of citizenship.

An example of ascribed irreversible status is age.  His conclusion is based on the fact that an ascribed status within a social structure is indicative of the behavior that one can exhibit but it does not explain the action itself.  Ascribed status is an arbitrary system of classifying individuals that is not fixed in the way that most people think.

Status is a social phenomenon rather than a biological one. The meaning is derived from the collection of expectations of how an individual should behave and what the expected treatment of that individual is. If an individual lies about a biological fact or social accomplishment and this lie remains undiscovered by others and is accepted by them, then in this social system, his status will be based on the lie. His status would not be based on a biological fact or social accomplishment.

Behavior toward the individual will be in accordance with the accepted lie.  Consequently, behavior expected from that individual will also be in accordance with that accepted lie rather than the ascribed status that would be associated with him if the truth were known. The success of the structure requires that the expectations remain constant, even if they are illegitimately acquired, given that the truth is never discovered.  This further highlights the arbitrariness of ascribed status because there is no biological basis or universal truth for assigning these societal rankings to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Foladare|first1= Irving S.|year= 1969|title= A Clarification of "Ascribed Status" and "Achieved Status"|journal= The Sociological Quarterly|volume= 10|issue= 1|pages= 53–61|jstor= 4105001 |doi= 10.1111/j.1533-8525.1969.tb02061.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low self-esteem==
There is a positive correlation between an individual's self-esteem and their ascribed status; for this purpose, self-esteem is defined as a liking and respect for oneself which has its basis in reality.  Individuals with a low social status generally have a lower self-esteem.  A negative image of oneself among individuals with lower ascribed statuses is the result of the internalization of the expectations that others have of them and the treatment that they receive based on those statuses.

The juxtaposition of their own value systems against the larger society's view often leaves individuals of a lower status with low self-esteem without regard to the individual’s actual capabilities.  A negative self-image may stifle an individual's efforts to acquire a certain achieved status; this illustrates how a low ascribed status can result in a low achieved status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacques | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Chason | first2 = K.

==Minorities and status inconsistency==
Ascribed statuses are determined by the dominant groups in society and as a result, minorities are often assigned lower statuses.  Minority groups are forced to attempt to reconcile the conflicts that arise from the social expectations that are linked with their assigned statuses in society and their perceived view of themselves.  In the face of the knowledge that individuals occupy more than one ascribed role at a time, it becomes evident that there may be some statuses in society’s multi-dimensional structure that do not comfortably coexist.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Consistency is defined as the degree to which an individual’s social rank positions that exist within important status hierarchies are at a comparable level.  The greater mobility of class systems produces less status consistency. In Canada, for example, most university professors with advanced academic degrees enjoy high social prestige but earn only average salaries. Low status consistency means that classes are much harder to define than castes.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, Gerber,  John, Linda (2010). ''Sociology 7th Canadian Ed.'' Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc.. pp. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the root of the problem of status inconsistency is the inability of individuals to reconcile the conflicting expectations.  A woman from a racial minority group may not experience status inconsistency because as a woman and as a member of a minority group, she may be considered to be of a lower ascribed status.  But, if this woman rejects the assigned roles that are associated with her status, she experiences status inconsistency.

To offer another example, a woman born into a wealthy family occupies both a high and a low ascribed status within the social structure: her inherited resources and social networks are advantageous but her role as a woman may be considered inferior.  When a person holds a high rank on one status dimension and low rank on another, the expectations of the two are often at odds with one another.

The two general consequences that arise from the tension that exists between the differing expectations are frustration and uncertainty about how one should act, given how others believe they should behave, and their own perceived notions of their abilities and the course of action that they should take to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jackson |first1=Elton F. |year= 1962|title=Status Consistency and Symptoms of Stress |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=469–480 |jstor=2090028 |doi=10.2307/2090028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Wealth is not the only social characteristic that defines an individual's ascribed status.  Religion is also a factor. If a person's family identifies with a particular religion, be it [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], etc., generally that person may be presumed to adopt the same religion as their biological or adopted parents. An individual's religion or absence of religion becomes a part of his or her ascribed status.  The social norms of a particular religion may have different ascribed statuses than those given by the larger society because followers are ascribed status based on the religious doctrines that govern their belief.  

Ascribed status can also be closely linked with master status, as they both involve what a person is born into. Master status is a broader term that includes more topics than ascribed status.

==Caste system==

The [[castes]] are an example of a stratification structure based on ascribed status.&lt;ref&gt;The Sociology: A Study of Society, p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsMyDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=%22Ascribed+status%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ascribed%20status%22&amp;f=false 190], Irshad Ahmad Wani&lt;/ref&gt; Each level in the stratification structure is known as a caste. Everyone is born into a specific caste. The caste of the parents generally determines the status of their children, regardless of ability or merit. The ranks of the caste system include:

* priests and scholars
* rulers, warriors, and those concerned with the defense and administration of the well-being of their town or village
* traders, merchants, and people involved in agricultural production
* laborers, servants, and other low-paying jobs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3271">In [[mathematics]], the '''Bing–Borsuk conjecture''' states that every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]] [[absolute neighborhood retract]] space is a [[topological manifold]]. The conjecture has been proved for dimensions 1 and 2, and it is known that the 3-dimensional version of the conjecture implies the [[Poincaré conjecture]].

==Definitions==

A [[topological space]]  is ''homogeneous'' if, for any two points &lt;math&gt;m_1, m_2 \in M&lt;/math&gt;, there is a [[homeomorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; which takes &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt;. 

A [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an ''absolute neighborhood retract'' (ANR) if, for every closed embedding &lt;math&gt;f: M \rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space), there exists an [[open neighbourhood]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the image &lt;math&gt;f(M)&lt;/math&gt; which [[retract]]s to &lt;math&gt;f(M)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.|first1=Halverson, Denise|last2=Dušan|first2=Repovš,|title=The Bing–Borsuk and the Busemann conjectures|journal=Mathematical Communications|date=23 December 2008|volume=13|issue=2|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/30884|language=en|issn=1331-0623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an alternate statement of the Bing–Borsuk conjecture: suppose &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is [[embedding|embedded]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{m+n}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;m \geq 3&lt;/math&gt; and this embedding can be extended to an embedding of &lt;math&gt;M \times (-\varepsilon, \varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has a mapping cylinder neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;N=C_\varphi&lt;/math&gt; of some map &lt;math&gt;\varphi: \partial N \rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; with mapping cylinder projection &lt;math&gt;\pi: N \rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is an [[approximate fibration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daverman|first1=R.

==History==

The conjecture was first made in a paper by [[R. H. Bing]] and [[Karol Borsuk]] in 1965, who proved it for &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; and 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bing|first1=R.

Włodzimierz Jakobsche showed in 1978 that, if the Bing–Borsuk conjecture is true in dimension 3, then the Poincaré conjecture must also be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakobsche|first1=W.|title=The Bing–Borsuk conjecture is stronger than the Poincaré conjecture|journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae|volume=106|issue=2|url=https://eudml.org/doc/211089|language=en|issn=0016-2736}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Busemann conjecture]] states that every [[Busemann G-space|Busemann &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-space]] is a topological manifold. It is a special case of the Bing–Borsuk conjecture. The Busemann conjecture is known to be true for dimensions 1 to&amp;nbsp;4.

'''Class discrimination''', also known as '''classism''', is [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[social class]] which still occurs in societies around the world today. It includes individual attitudes, behaviors, systems of policies and practices that are set up to benefit the [[upper class]] at the expense of the [[Under class|lower class]] or vice versa.&lt;ref name=Kadi&gt;{{cite book|last=Kadi|first=Joanna|title=Thinking Class|publisher=[[South End Press]]|year=1996|pages=|url=|isbn=0-89608-548-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Socioeconomic, racial/ethnic and gender inequalities in academic achievement have been widely reported in the United States, but how these three axes of inequality intersect to determine academic and non-academic outcomes among school-aged children is not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bécares|first=Laia|last2=Priest|first2=Naomi|date=27 October 2015|title=Understanding the Influence of Race/Ethnicity, Gender, and Class on Inequalities in Academic and Non-Academic Outcomes among Eighth-Grade Students: Findings from an Intersectionality Approach|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141363|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=10|pages=e0141363|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141363|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Class structures existed in a simplified form in pre-agricultural societies, but it has evolved into a more complex and established following the establishment of permanent agriculture-based civilizations with a food surplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of the World Course No. 8080 [Audio CD]|author=Peter N. Stearns (Narrator)|publisher=The Teaching Company|asin=B000W595CC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classism started to be practiced around the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Serinity|title=Encyclopedia of Women and World Religion|date=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0028648609|page=181|author2=Katie Cannon|editor=Serinity Young|format=Print|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Encyclopedia_of_women_and_world_religion.html?id=RYgYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutional versus personal classism ==
The term classism can refer to personal prejudice against lower classes as well as to institutional classism, just as the term [[racism]] can refer either strictly to personal prejudice or to [[institutional racism]]. The former has been defined as "the ways in which conscious or unconscious classism is manifest in the various institutions of our society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gustavus.edu/reslife/documents/Classism.doc|title=Classism Definitions|website=gustavus.edu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "interpersonal" is sometimes used in place of "personal" as in "institutional classism (versus) interpersonal classism"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Langhout|first=Regina Day|title=Assessing Classism in Academic Settings|date=Winter 2007|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/review_of_higher_education/v030/30.2langhout.html|last2=Rosselli|last3=Feinstein|first2=Francine|first3=Jonathan|journal=The Review of Higher Education|newspaper=|volume=30|issue=2|pages=145–184|doi=10.1353/rhe.2006.0073}}&lt;/ref&gt; and terms such as "attitude" or "attitudinal" may replace "interpersonal" as contrasting with institutional classism as in the Association of Magazine Media's definition of classism as "any attitude or institutional practice which subordinates people due to income, occupation, education and/or their economic condition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magazine.org/diversity/managing/defining/8478.aspx "Glossary"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309015508/http://www.magazine.org/diversity/managing/defining/8478.aspx|date=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classism is also sometimes broken down into more than two categories as in "personal, institutional and cultural" classism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Adams|editor1-first=Maurianne|editor2-last=Bell|editor2-first=Lee Anne|editor3-last=Griffin|editor3-first=Pat|title=Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice|edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|page=317|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OI-5SlHR9PMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-415-95199-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common knowledge in sociolinguistics that metasocial language abounds in lower registers, thus the slang for various classes or racial castes.

== Media representation ==
Class discrimination can be seen in many different forms of media such as television shows, films and social media. Class discrimination in the media displays the knowledge of what people feel and think about classicism. When seeing class discrimination in films and television shows, people are influenced and believe that is how things are in real life, for whatever class is being displayed. Media is a big influence on the world today, with that something such as classism is can be seen in many different lights. Usually, the lower income people are displayed in the media as dirty, lack of education and manners and homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/mediarace/portrayal.htm|title=Portrayal of Minorities in the Film, Media and Entertainment Industries|website=web.stanford.edu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From both sides of that being displayed in the media, people are able to take what they see, whether that be true or not and believe what they want to believe. People can use the media to learn more about different social classes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalmediaproject.org/cml/topicbackground/race-ethnicity/|title=Race &amp; Ethnicity|website=criticalmediaproject.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or use the media, such as social media to influence others on what they believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.harvard.edu/andresmh/2013/04/classism-accountability-and-social-media/|title=Classism, Accountability, and Social Media|website=blogs.harvard.edu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, people who are in a social class that is portrayed in a bad way by the media can be effected in school and social life as "[t]eenagers who grew up in poverty reported higher levels of discrimination, and the poorer the teens were, the more they experienced discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.wisc.edu/news-events/social-class-discrimination-contributes-to-poorer-health/38020|title=Social-class discrimination contributes to poorer health|website=wisc.edu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A concrete example of classism in the media is the fictional character [[Homer_Simpson|Homer Simpson]] from [[The Simpsons]] who is portrayed as a thick, dumb, balding man with lack of education and manners. Another example of classism was identified in a [[YouTube]] video from TheThings titled "10 Hilarious Unanswered Questions About [[Peppa Pig]]" as 'a classist system'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Hilarious Unanswered Questions About Peppa Pig |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1AHZXq5x_8 |website=Youtube |publisher=TheThings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==
The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] contains protections against social class discrimination, but only a few signatory states have signed and ratified these protections. Those that have signed and ratified this have implemented domestic laws against favela discrimination because of social class (in the same way that [[race discrimination]], [[sex discrimination]] or [[age discrimination]] have been legislated against).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14713">'''Classicide''' is the deliberate and systematic destruction, in whole or in part, of a [[social class]] through persecution and violence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The term "classicide" was termed by sociologist [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]] as a term that is similar but distinct from the term [[genocide]]. Examples includes [[Mass killings in the Soviet Union|Joseph Stalin's mass killing]] of the affluent middle-class peasant [[Kulaks]] who were identified as "class enemies" by the [[Soviet Union]]. Similar classicide has been committed by [[China]] during the [[Great Leap Forward]], by [[North Vietnam]] as part of the [[Land reform in North Vietnam|Land Reform]], and by the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]].

In 1929, at the beginning of his dictatorship, [[Joseph Stalin]] demanded the "liquidation of kulak's as a class".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine|last=Conquest|first=Robert|publisher=Oxford Press Inc.|year=1986|isbn=0-19-504054-6|location=198 Madison Avenue, New York, New York, 10016-4314|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kulak]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s were peasants who were deemed "wealthy" by Stalin in 1929.

{{main article|Mass killings of landlords under Mao Zedong}}
In 1947, during the [[Chinese Civil War]], three years before the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Mao Zedong]] won the hearts of the [[Communist party|Communist Party]] and the peasant class by introducing a new land reform. This land reform encouraged the mass murder of [[landlord]]s and well-off peasants in order to redistribute the land to the peasant class and other landless workers. The idea of killing landlords was first outlined by Kang Sheng, expert in terror tactics, in 1947. Ren Bishi, a member of the communist party's central committee, stated that "30,000,000 landlords and rich peasants had to be destroyed" (Rudolph J).&lt;ref name="www.theepochtimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theepochtimes.com/how-mao-radicalized-peasants-to-kill-landlords_2232983.html|title=How Mao Radicalized Peasants to Kill Landlords|date=2017-03-15|work=www.theepochtimes.com|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reform was an open door for violence when Mao insisted that the peasants themselves should do the killing. Landlords were tortured. They were dismembered, buried alive, strangled, shot, etc. There is no way to know exactly how many people were killed but the numbers range anywhere from one million to 28 million.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Cambodia’s then-president [[Lon Nol]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; was initially unaware and did not address any of the Nixon bombings so they lasted from 1969-1975.

Victims of the US attacks saw the American enemy as rich, upper-class and viewed Lon Nol as possessed the same characteristics as Nixon—rich and powerful. [[Pol Pot]]&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia1.html|title=GENOCIDE -  CAMBODIA|website=www.ppu.org.uk|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognized the fear and hatred the people of Cambodia had towards the upper class and used this hostile environment as a tactic to gain control over the lower and upper classes which brought the [[Khmer Rouge]] reign his control.

To enforce his control over the regime, he would need to cleanse the country of anyone who fit the description of 'upper class’, and also the  ‘Khmer minority’&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; who shared cultures with the former leader, Nol. Supporters of Nol were primarily rich, upper-class elite. Therefore, Pol Pot targeted these individuals. Anyone who was educated including doctors, lawyers, and teachers were murdered.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Following the bombings, by Americans, Pol Pot persuaded victims of the bombings to join the Khmer Rouge by playing on their fearful state of mind. Anyone who would not cooperate was simply murdered.

Pol Pot’s actions eventually led to displacement and created refugees. He soon abolished civil and political liberties&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; which allowed his policies for genocide to be permissible and remained unchecked. Although the majority of the Khmer population massacred were mostly Vietnamese immigrants and [[Cham minority]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; over 2 million Khmer natives were still murdered.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Children were ripped from their families and their parents were killed in cold blood, soldiers and foreign language speakers were not excluded in the killings either. Pol Pot continued his raids by attacking border towns of Vietnam, which eventually ended his reign. Many natives of Cambodia believed that if it weren’t for the Vietnamese army fighting back, the killings would have lasted longer.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Computer Space forum''' is a yearly [[computer art]] festivals, organized by the Student Computer Art Society (SCAS) in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. It's one of the oldest computer festivals in Bulgaria, founded in 1989.{{when|date=December 2010}}

== Description ==
An international non-commercial event and platform joining young artists, students and producers of computer graphics, computer animation, off-line multimedia, electronic music and web design. Computer Space includes contest and festival part and all the events are free and open to the public especially encouraging the participation of students and young artists. Every year more than 200 projects in the sphere of computer arts have been presented by their authors and discussed. The creative idea, the transformation of the idea to project, the combination of technology and art in the implementation, the society impact of computers have been always a main focus of the symposia in the frame of Computer Space.

== History ==
Starting as an [[electronic music]] festival in 1989 Computer Space included graphics and animation sections next few years. Web design has been one of the fast-growing sections last 7 years.

During the 1980s [[Bulgaria]] specialized in producing microcomputers in the former communist block countries and the [[Soviet Union]] specialized in producing big machines and supercomputers. The [[Eastern block]] countries had the so-called Economic Inter-support Council and in the frame of that Council each country has been developing some economic area. At that time it was not so clear the microcomputers will be the future and some experts believe that the microcomputers are mainly for games and home usage. It happened that in 1981 the first microcomputer in Eastern Europe called Imko II then (in 1982) called [[Pravetz series 8|Pravetz 82]] (with 8 bit processor) has been released in Bulgaria. This was [[Apple II]] compatible microcomputer and it came to life just after Apple II.

This situation placed Bulgaria in the leadership role in microcomputers production not only in [[Eastern Europe]] but also in the Middle East and even in the Central Europe. A huge plants have been built exporting thousands of Pravetz 82 and later Pravetz 16 (with 8086/88 processor) to all Eastern block countries and to Arabic countries. The development of computer industry in that time strongly influenced the development of software and also the development of computer arts. In the beginning of 80's the first analogue synthesiser (produced in Paris and occupying almost one big hall) has been installed in the Bulgarian National Radio and thus giving a strong tool to the electronic music composers from the Balkan region. The own production of EGA and VGA displays in the middle and late 80s pushed the computer graphics and visualization to a new level.

Being a barometer of electronic and computer arts in Sough-Eastern Europe Computer Space forum often offers the artists possibility to debate such fundamental issues as relations between computer arts and other contemporary arts, place of the artists in the creative process, styles in digital arts, technology and society issues etc. Some of the symposium topics like 'The Violence of Information', 'Virtual Identity', 'Computer arts or computers in the arts', 'Art or a design' opened a lot of following discussions in many artistic forums and blogs.

One of the often open questions during the many discussions is the definition of art in the computer generated or manipulated products. For example, some computer graphics like 3D architectural or car images could demonstrate brilliant design technologies and could 'touch' the users emotionally. Is this an art? Or we may see very nice Photoshop made drawings of landscapes or processed photographs. And, another often posed question, the value of such creations, especially in comparison to the value of oil paintings that exist in just one unique copy. These and many similar questions allow the artists to debate the future of the arts and interaction between the arts.

Computer arts have a lot of forms and appearance and this evolution is always been in a focus of CS seminars. Computer graphics, computer animation, multimedia (CD/ DVD based games, encyclopaedia, fairy-tale stories, galleries, training modules etc.), web-art, net-art, electronic/computer music, VRs, interactive art installations and many forms are regarded as computer arts. But, it is always a big discussion when the synthesis of technology and creative ideas becomes an art. And, how to distinguish the art from the brilliant design or from the perfect modelling? Shall we consider the impact and raised emotions as a prove of the artistic elements of some project? And, if and how the entertainment projects (for example, games) could be considered as an art ?

== Reception ==
The event is mentioned regularly in national and international press.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120426004935/http://netmag.bg/past-events/242-computer-space-2010 242-computer-space-2010] article in the [[.net Magazine]] about Computer Space 2010 (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121002215418/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D23191%26URL_DO%3DDO_PRINTPAGE%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html UNESCO Young Digital Creators programme and Computer Space] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201730/http://www.dexigner.com/news/11783 Computer Space 2007 in Designer] (2007, archived)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2003 [[President of the Republic of Bulgaria]] awarded the project in the category "Society and Institution web".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120207231326/http://www.president.bg/news.php?id=1006&amp;st=1040 The President of Republic of Bulgaria awarding the project in Society and Institution web category] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of well-known studios and artists from the [[Computer science|CS]] participating with projects over the years, for instance: [[Braam Jordaan]] ([[South Africa]]), [[Academy of Media Arts Cologne]] ([[Cologne]]), [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe|ZKM]] ([[Karlsruhe]]), [[IRCAM]] (Paris), Platige Studio ([[Poland]]), Studio Aka (UK), [[University of Geneva|Miralab]] (Switzerland), Institute for Electroacoustic of [[Vienna University]] and many others. Most of them are pioneers of some new methods and technologies in computer arts and modern media.

'''Flow maps''' in [[cartography]] are a mix of [[map]]s and [[flow chart]]s, that "show the movement of objects from one location to another, such as the number of people in a migration, the amount of goods being traded, or the number of packets in a network".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Phan | first1=Doantam |   | last2=Xiao | first2=Ling | last3=Yeh | first3=Ron | last4=Hanrahan | first4=Pat | last5=Winograd | first5=Terry | date=2005 | url=http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/flow_map_layout/ | title=Flow Map Layout | journal=Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis '05) | pages=219–224 | doi=10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Overview ==
[[File:Minard.png|300px|thumb|right|Minard's map of [[Napoleon]]'s disastrous [[French invasion of Russia (1812)|Russian campaign of 1812]].]]
Flow maps can be used to show movement of almost anything, such as:&lt;ref name= "Har99"&gt; {{cite book | first=Robert L. | last=Harris | date=1999 | title=Information Graphics | page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* What it is that flows, moves, migrates, etc.
* What direction the flow is moving and/or what the source and destination are.
* How much is flowing, being transferred, transported, etc.
* General information about what is flowing and how it is flowing. 

In contrast to route maps, flow maps show little aside from the paths from one point to another.&lt;ref name= "Har99"/&gt;

== Other types of flow maps ==
[[File:Sankey_diagram_human_circulatory_system.svg|thumb|150px|A non-cartographic flow map showing the relative percentages of cardiac output delivered to major organ systems]]
Beside the flow maps in [[cartography]] there are several other kind of flow maps:
* Baker flow map of fluid flows 
* Blood flow maps, see [[history of neuroimaging]] 
* Flow map or ''solution operator'', see [[random dynamical system]]
* Process flow map of a manufacturing process
* [[Sankey diagram]] in petroleum engineering
* Traffic Flow Maps
* XSL flow maps, see [[XSL Formatting Objects]]

{{New Netherland}}
The '''Flushing Remonstrance''' was a 1657 [[petition]] to [[Director-General of New Netherland|Director-General]] of [[New Netherland]] [[Peter Stuyvesant]], in which some thirty residents of the small settlement at [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] requested an exemption to his ban on [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] worship. It is considered a precursor to the [[United States Constitution]]'s provision on [[freedom of religion]] in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}  Its 350th anniversary was celebrated in 2007 in ceremonies throughout [[Queens, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirshon, Nicholas. 1657 Flushing Remonstrance recalled on anniversary by descendants. ''New York Daily News'' http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/1657-flushing-remonstrance-recalled-anniversary-descendants-article-1.274227 December 11, 2007, Accessed January 14, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Kenneth T. Jackson]], the Flushing Remonstrance was remarkable for four reasons:
* it articulated a fundamental right that is as basic to American freedom as any other, 
*the authors backed up their words with actions by sending it to an official not known for tolerance, 
*they stood up for others in articulating a principle that was of little discernible benefit to themselves, 
*and the language of the remonstrance was as beautiful as the sentiments they expressed.&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite news |title=A Colony With a Conscience |first=Kenneth T. |last=Jackson |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/27/opinion/27jackson.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The village, originally named as [[Vlissingen]], then Vlishing, and now [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], [[Queens, New York]], had been part of the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]]. It was originally settled by English people operating under a patent, issued by Governor [[Willem Kieft]] in 1645, granting them the same state of religious freedom existing in Holland, then the most tolerant of European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Driscoll|first1=James|author2= The Voelker Orth Museum Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden |title=Flushing: 1880–1935|date=2005|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=0738538426|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuyvesant, however, with his 1656 ordinance against illegal religious meetings, had formally banned the practice of all religions outside of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], the established church of the Netherlands, in the colony.&lt;ref name="Liberty Mag"/&gt; His often-derided decision flew against the approximate hundred-year evolution of religious tolerance in the Netherlands. During this time the country was revolting against Spanish rule, rebelling against an imposed Inquisition, attempting to form a national identity, and trying to unify Calvinist and Catholic provinces. The Dutch toleration debates were lengthy, bumpy, heated, and full of political intrigue and even assassination. The writer Thomas Broderick states, "I believe the true Dutch legacy is not one of toleration but of discussion. New Amsterdam and the Republic show us that a robust, open public discourse is the surest way to eventual social improvement. Toleration and acceptance are political and moral imperatives, and the Flushing remonstrance and great Dutch toleration debates in Europe and North America teach us that social change takes time, open dialogue, disagreement, and failure before progress is to be made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Broderick|first1=Thomas|title=New Amsterdam and the Great Dutch Toleration Debates|url=http://www1.umassd.edu/euro/2013papers/broderick.pdf|website=University of Massachusetts|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuyvesant's policy was not much different from the one evolving in the Netherlands: an official recognition of the Dutch Reformed Church bundled with broad tolerance within the church and a policy of [[connivance]], turning a blind eye to non-conformist religious practices. On another front, the Stuyvesant family was broadly tolerant.  Judith, Stuyvesant's wife, was a fierce advocate for New York's slaves, promoting the practice of baptism as a first step toward freedom.&lt;ref name=nycreligion&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Stuyvesant’s relentless quest for order in New Amsterdam pushes Africans out of the church|date=March 7, 2012|url=http://www.nycreligion.info/peter-stuyvesant-relentless-quest-order-push-africans-church/|publisher=NYCReligion.info|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His policy met with resistance from some English settlers in the towns of Vlissingen (currently [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]]), Rustdorp (currently [[Jamaica, Queens]]), and 's-Gravesend (currently [[Gravesend, Brooklyn]]), places where [[Quaker]] missions were sent.  Stuyvesant's actions, however, also met with the support of other English settlers and magistrates who informed on those embracing unorthodox teachings and meeting in small and unsanctioned religious meetings of lay people called [[conventicle]]s.  Thus, Stuyvesant found himself drawn into the religious debates and bickering of the English community in the Atlantic colonies&lt;ref name=Haefeli&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haefeli|first1=Evan|title=New Netherland and the Dutch origins of American religious liberty|date=2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0812244087|page=222|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and debates in England which culminated in the [[Conventicle Act 1664]].

This policy resulted in numerous acts of religious persecution and harassment.  In 1656 [[William Wickenden]], a Baptist minister from Rhode Island, was arrested by Dutch colonial authorities, jailed, fined, and exiled for baptizing Christians in Flushing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformedreader.org/history/armitage/ch09.htm ''A History of the Baptists'' by Thomas Armitage]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year Robert Hodgson was arrested, tried, and sentenced to two years of manual labor with slaves for his preaching of Quakerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haefeli|first1=Evan|title=New Netherland and the Dutch origins of American religious liberty|date=2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0812244087|pages=61–68|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1661, in the town of Rustdorp, [[Henry Townsend (Norwich)]] and Samuel Spicer were fined for holding Quaker conventicles and Townsend was banished as well.  Stuyvesant sent three new magistrates, all Englishmen, and a half dozen soldiers to gather information on dissidents.  The soldiers were [[billet]]ed in the homes of the dissidents until they agreed to conform.  In 1662, in 's-Gravesande, Samuel Spicer and his mother, Micha, along with John and Mary Tilton were imprisoned and later banished.  They moved to [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], then outside of the authority of New Netherland, and returned to their town after 1664 when the British took control of the colony.&lt;ref name=Haefeli/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Descendants of John Tilton|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cathie/ctilton.htm|website=RootsWeb|publisher=Ancestry.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The Flushing Remonstrance was signed on December 27, 1657, by a group of Dutch citizens who were affronted by [[persecution]] of Quakers and the religious policies of Stuyvesant.&lt;ref name="Liberty Mag"&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael Peabody |coauthors= |title=The Flushing Remonstrance |url=http://www.libertymagazine.org/article/articleview/532/1/86/ |publisher= Liberty Magazine |date=November–December 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204215137/http://www.libertymagazine.org/article/articleview/532/1/86/ |archivedate =December 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news|author=Glenn Collins |title=Precursor of the Constitution Goes on Display in Queens |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/nyregion/05remonstrance.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of them were [[Quakers]].&lt;ref name=jackson /&gt;  The Remonstrance ends with:

:The law of love, peace and liberty in the states extending to Jews, Turks and Egyptians, as they are considered sonnes of Adam, which is the glory of the outward state of Holland, soe love, peace and liberty, extending to all in Christ Jesus, condemns hatred, war and bondage. And because our Saviour sayeth it is impossible but that offences will come, but woe unto him by whom they cometh, our desire is not to offend one of his little ones, in whatsoever form, name or title hee appears in, whether Presbyterian, Independent, Baptist or Quaker, but shall be glad to see anything of God in any of them, desiring to doe unto all men as we desire all men should doe unto us, which is the true law both of Church and State; for our Saviour sayeth this is the law and the prophets.

:Therefore if any of these said persons come in love unto us, we cannot in conscience lay violent hands upon them, but give them free egresse and regresse unto our Town, and houses, as God shall persuade our consciences, for we are bounde by the law of God and man to doe good unto all men and evil to noe man. And this is according to the patent and charter of our Towne, given unto us in the name of the States General, which we are not willing to infringe, and violate, but shall houlde to our patent and shall remaine, your humble subjects, the inhabitants of Vlishing.

In response Stuyvesant dismissed the local government and chose new Dutch replacements as leaders.  Four who signed were arrested by order of Stuyvesant. Two immediately recanted, but the writer of the remonstrance, [[Edward Hart (settler)|Edward Hart]], and sheriff of Flushing Tobias Feake remained firm in their convictions. Both men were remanded to prison where they survived in isolation on rations of bread and water for over a month. After friends and family petitioned Stuyvesant on behalf of the elderly Hart, the clerk was released on penalty of banishment. Feake held out for a few more weeks, but eventually recanted and was pardoned after being fined and banned from holding public office.

Stuyvesant asserted that he wasn't violating the signers' "freedom of conscience," only their right to worship outside of family prayer meetings. In addition he proclaimed March 13, 1658 a Day of Prayer for the purpose of repenting from the sin of religious tolerance.&lt;ref name=nycreligion/&gt;

Subsequently, [[John Bowne]] of the colony allowed Quakers to meet in his [[John Bowne House|house]]. He was arrested in 1662 and brought before Stuyvesant. Unrepentant, Bowne was sentenced to banishment to Holland, though he was of English descent and spoke no Dutch. After several months in the foreign land, Bowne petitioned the directors of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. After a month of deliberation, the Dutch West India Company agreed to support Bowne, and advised Stuyvesant by a letter (1663) that he was to end religious persecution in the colony. One year later, in 1664, the colony fell to British control. The [[John Bowne House]], built before 1662, still stands in historic preservation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.BowneHouse.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Quaker Meeting House (Queens)|Quaker Meeting House]] in Flushing, built 1694, is now the oldest house of worship in continuous use in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.FlushingFriends.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Account of John Bowne==
John Bowne's account of the Flushing Remonstrance and its aftermath is found in his journal of events.  Bowne, who had arrived in 1651, soon began to host Quaker meetings in his home, although he did not convert until 1659.  He was to become a leader of American Quakers and a correspondent of Quaker founder [[George Fox]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Later history==
The earliest copy of the document dates also from 1657 as an official copy of the original, but the original has been lost.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt; This early copy is in longhand, on moderately severely damaged and degraded paper, yet essentially complete. It has seldom been in public anywhere.

The Queens Borough President's Office held a celebration of the 350th anniversary of the Remonstrance in 2007. Descendants of the signers, Bowne, Stuyvesant, and the arresting officer were invited and in attendance, and the original copy of the Remonstrance was brought down from the State Archives in Albany for several weeks' public display.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;

A park, high school and an elementary school in [[Flushing, Queens]] are named in [[John Bowne]] 's honor.

PS 21 in Flushing is named after Edward Hart, the writer of the Remonstrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/25/Q021/default.htm | title=P.S. 021 Edward Hart | publisher=New York City Department of Education | accessdate=December 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8107">The '''foot–pound–second system''' or '''FPS system''' is a system of units built on three fundamental units: the [[foot (unit)|foot]] for [[length]], the [[pound (mass)|(avoirdupois) pound]] for either [[mass]] or [[force]] (see below), and the [[second]] for [[time]].&lt;ref name=cardarelli&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopaedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures: Their SI Equivalences and Origins |last=Cardarelli |first=François |publisher=Springer |year=2003 | isbn=978-1-85233-682-0 |chapter=The Foot–Pound–Second (FPS) System |pages=51–55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==
Collectively, the variants of the FPS system were the most common system in technical publications in English until the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=cardarelli/&gt;

{{anchor|Stroud}}Errors can be avoided and translation between the systems facilitated by labelling all physical quantities consistently with their units. Especially in the context of the FPS system this is sometimes known as the '''Stroud system''' after [[William Stroud]], who popularized it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Stroud system of teaching dynamics |last1=Henderson |first1=James B. |last2=Godfrey |first2=C. |journal=The Mathematical Gazette |volume=12 |number=170 |year=1924 |pages=99–105 |jstor=3604647}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{GravEngAbs|system=English}}

=== Pound as mass unit ===
{{anchor|mass}}
When the pound is used as a unit of mass, the core of the coherent system is similar and functionally equivalent to the corresponding subsets of the [[International System of Units]] (SI), using [[metre–kilogram–second system of units|metre, kilogram and second]] (MKS), and the earlier [[centimetre–gram–second system of units]] (CGS).

In this sub-system, the unit of [[force]] is a derived unit known as the [[poundal]].&lt;ref name=cardarelli/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1\,\text{pdl} = 1\,\text{lb} \cdot 1\,\frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The international standard symbol for the pound as unit of mass rather than force is lb.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Std 260.1™-2004, IEEE Standard Letter Symbols for Units of Measurement (SI Units, Customary Inch-Pound Units, and Certain Other Units) &lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Cleanup|section|date=October 2011}}
Everett (1861)&lt;!--ref missing--&gt; proposed the metric [[dyne]] and [[erg]] as the units of force and energy in the FPS system.

Latimer Clark's (1891) "Dictionary of Measures"&lt;!--ref missing--&gt; contains ''celo'' (acceleration), ''vel'' or ''velo'' (velocity) and ''pulse'' (momentum) as proposed names for FPS absolute units.&lt;!--definitions or explanations missing--&gt;

=== Pound-force as force unit ===
{{anchor|force}}
The '''technical''' or '''gravitational FPS system''',&lt;ref name=cr&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lEi8RU6Br6YC&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;pg=PA5 J. M. Coulson, J. F. Richardson, J. R. Backhurst, J. H. Harker: Coulson &amp; Richardson's Chemical Engineering: Fluid flow, heat transfer, and mass transfer.]&lt;/ref&gt; is a coherent variant of the FPS system that is most common among engineers in the United States. It takes the [[pound-force]] as a fundamental unit of force instead of the pound as a fundamental unit of mass.

In this sub-system, the unit of mass is a derived unit known as the [[slug (unit)|slug]].&lt;ref name=cardarelli/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1\,\text{slug} = 1\,\text{lbf} \cdot 1\,\frac{\text{s}^2}{\text{ft}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the context of the gravitational FPS system, the pound-force (lbf) is sometimes referred to as the pound (lb).

=== Pound as force unit ===
{{anchor|weight}}
Another variant of the FPS system uses both the pound-mass and the pound-force, but neither the slug nor the poundal. The resulting system is not coherent, lacking electrical or molar units, and is sometimes also known as the '''British engineering system''', although rarely used nowadays in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=cr/&gt;

== Other units ==
{{Cleanup|section|date=October 2011}}

=== Molar units ===
The unit of substance in the FPS system is the pound-mole (lb-mol) = {{val|273.16|e=24}}.  Until the SI decided to adopt the gram-mole, the mole was directly derived from the mass unit as (mass unit)/(atomic mass unit).  The unit (lbf⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ft)-mol also appears in a former definition of the atmosphere.

=== Electromagnetic units ===
The Electrostatic and Electromagnetic systems are derived from units of length and force, mainly.  As such, these are ready extensions of any system of containing length, mass, time. Stephen Dresner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dresner|first=Stephen|title=Units of Measurement|year=1971|publisher=Hastings House|location=New York|pages=193–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives the derived electrostatic and electromagnetic units in both the foot–pound–second and foot–slug–second systems.  In practice, these are most associated with the centimetre–gram–second system.  The 1929 "International Critical Tables" gives in the symbols and systems fpse = FPS electrostatic system and fpsm = FPS electromagnetic system.  Under the conversions for charge, the following are given.  The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 1979 (Edition 60), also lists fpse and fpsm as standard abbreviations.

; Electromagnetic FPS (EMU, stat-)
: 1 fpsm unit = 117.581866 [[cgsm]] unit (Biot-second) {{clarify|date=December 2016}}
; Electrostatic FPS (ESU, ab-)
: 1 fpse unit = 3583.8953 cgse unit (Franklin)
: 1 fpse unit = 1.1954588×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; abs coulomb

=== Units of light ===
The ''[[candela|candle]]'' and the ''foot-candle'' were the first defined units of light, defined in the Metropolitan Gas Act (1860).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jerrard|first=H G|title=A Dictionary of Scientific Units|year=1985|publisher=Chapman and Hall|location=London|isbn=0412281007|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foot-candle is the intensity of light at one foot from a ''standard candle''.  The units were internationally recognised in 1881, and adopted into the metric system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Donald|last=Fenna|year=2003|title=Dictionary of weights and measures|isbn=978-0-19-860522-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conversions ==
Together with the fact that the term "weight" is used for the gravitational force in some technical contexts (physics, engineering) and for mass in others (commerce, law),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/fs376-b.pdf NIST Federal Standard 376B] , p. 13. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816011202/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/fs376-b.pdf |date=August 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the distinction often does not matter in practice, the coexistence of variants of the FPS system causes confusion over the nature of the unit "pound". Its relation to international metric units is expressed in kilograms, not newtons, though, and in earlier times it was defined by means of a mass prototype to be compared with a [[weighing scale|two-pan balance]] which is agnostic of local gravitational differences.

In July 1959, the various national foot and avoirdupois pound standards were replaced by the international foot of precisely {{val|0.3048|u=m}} and the international pound of precisely {{val|0.45359237|u=kg}}, making conversion between the systems a matter of simple arithmetic. The conversion for the poundal is given by 1&amp;nbsp;pdl =&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;lb·ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = {{val|0.138254954376|ul=N}} (precisely).&lt;ref name=cardarelli/&gt;

To convert between the absolute and gravitational FPS systems one needs to fix the [[standard gravity|standard acceleration]] ''g'' which relates the pound to the pound-force.{{fact|date=April 2018}}
:&lt;math&gt;1\,\text{lbf} = 1\,\text{lb}\cdot g&lt;/math&gt;
While ''g'' strictly depends on one's location on the Earth surface, since 1901 in most contexts it is fixed conventionally at precisely ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;{{val|9.80665|u=m/s2}} ≈&amp;nbsp;{{val|32.17405|u=ft/s2}}.&lt;ref name=cardarelli/&gt; Therefore, the slug is about {{val|32.17405|u=lb}} or {{val|14.593903|u=kg}}.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the peak emotional experience of chills (goose bumps or shivers) when listening to music involves psychophysiological arousal and a rewarding effect. However, many aspects of peak emotion are still not understood. The current research takes a new perspective of peak emotional response of tears (weeping, lump in the throat). A psychophysiological experiment showed that self-reported chills increased electrodermal activity and subjective arousal whereas tears produced slow respiration during heartbeat acceleration, although both chills and tears induced pleasure and deep breathing. A song that induced chills was perceived as being both happy and sad whereas a song that induced tears was perceived as sad. A tear-eliciting song was perceived as calmer than a chill-eliciting song. These results show that tears involve pleasure from sadness and that they are psychophysiologically calming; thus, psychophysiological responses permit the distinction between chills and tears.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;Because such chills are a clear, discrete event and have the advantage of being elicited by music in emotion research, previous studies have examined the psychophysiological responses to music chills by measuring autonomic nervous system activity. To date, empirical studies have repeatedly shown that music chills are accompanied by increasing electrodermal activity (EDA) due to activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS&lt;sup&gt;10,11,12,13,14&lt;/sup&gt;). Further, a recent study suggested that chills are associated with enlarged pupil diameter, and there exists a positive relationship between chills and SNS activity&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;. Brain-imaging studies have also suggested that chills activate reward-related brain regions, such as the ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex&lt;sup&gt;16,17&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, music chills are accompanied by rewarding dopamine release in the caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens in the striatum&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the experience of chills seems to produce physiological arousal and reward for the listener.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tingling neuropsychophysiology"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tihanyi BT, Ferentzi E, Beissner F, Köteles F | title = The neuropsychophysiology of tingling | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 97–110 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29096941 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2017.10.015 | url = | quote = In this paper, we will review the current scientific knowledge on a special skin related sensation, tingling. The term refers to an altered sensation localized on the surface of the skin, which is not related to pain and thermal sensations. We have chosen this broad and somewhat vague description because tingling is a private qualia-type experience, which cannot be easily verbalized and communicated (Jackson, 1982). Therefore, tingling is an umbrella term that covers various sensations.&lt;br /&gt;Medicine places tingling under the general term paresthesia, i.e. sensations of a person's body with no apparent physical cause (NINDS, 2017).&amp;nbsp;... Tingling is linked to a variety of affective states connected with positive excitement and the feeling of being energized (Ayan, 2005; Bathmaker &amp; Avis, 2005; Gould, 1991). It was also associated with elevation, i.e. a pleasant positive moral emotion triggered by witnessing acts of human moral virtue (Haidt, 2003).&amp;nbsp;... As tingling or chills have been linked to a wide range of emotions, both positive and negative, as well as general arousal, it was suggested that they consist of at least two independent factors: tingling-goosebumps and cold-shiver. While the former is related to greater surprise, enjoyment and approach motivation, the latter is linked to disgust, fear, sadness, and avoidance motivation (Maruskin, Thrash, &amp; Elliot, 2012).&amp;nbsp;... The actual mechanisms behind affect-related tingling might be better illuminated by the deeply researched example of hedonic experiences. Emotional peak experiences are often accompanied by tingling or chills. Within this category, music appears to be the most frequent trigger of chills, experienced mostly at the neck and the arms (Harrison &amp; Loui, 2014).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;A related phenomenon is the recently described autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) (Barratt &amp; Davis, 2015). It is characterized by a static tingling sensation originating from the back of the head, then propagating to the neck, shoulder, arm, spine, and legs, which makes people feel relaxed and alert. Similar to chills, it can be triggered by a variety of external stimuli, but also by internal triggers, such as focusing attention, recalling the memory of a previous ASMR, meditating, or changes of mood or state of mind. It is also connected to the experience of intimacy, flow, or mindfulness (Kobayashi, 2015).&lt;br /&gt;Concerning the nervous system background, a neuroimaging study has shown that the intensity of chills correlated with activity of the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex (i.e., the centers of the reward circuitry), insula, and anterior cingulum (Blood &amp; Zatorre, 2001). It is possible that the emotional involvement evokes sympathetic arousal, which in turn is perceived as a tingling sensation (Grewe et al., 2010). The hypothesis that pleasant tingling is caused by emotional processes, and not the other way around, is supported by the fact that most people experiencing ASMR reported positive emotions during listening to music even in the absence of tingling (Barratt &amp; Davis, 2015).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensation commonly occurs as a mildly to moderately [[Euphoria#Music euphoria|pleasurable emotional response to music]] with skin tingling;&lt;ref name="pmid25101043" /&gt; piloerection and pupil dilation do not necessarily occur in all cases.&lt;ref name="Scientific Reports" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tingling neuropsychophysiology" /&gt; The psychological component (i.e., the pleasurable feeling) and physiological components (i.e., parasthesia, piloerection, and pupil dilation) of the response are mediated by the [[reward system]] and [[sympathetic nervous system]], respectively.&lt;ref name="Scientific Reports" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tingling neuropsychophysiology" /&gt; The stimuli that produce this response are unique to each individual.

Frisson is of short duration, lasting only a few seconds.&lt;ref name="ohio-state" /&gt; Typical stimuli include loud passages of music and passages—such as [[Appoggiatura|appoggiaturas]] and sudden [[modulation (music)|modulation]]—that violate some level of musical expectation.&lt;ref name="pmid24552785"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koelsch S | title = Brain correlates of music-evoked emotions | journal = Nature Reviews.

It has been shown that some experiencing musical frisson report reduced excitement when under administration of [[naloxone]] (an opioid receptor antagonist), suggesting musical frisson gives rise to endogenous opioid peptides similar to other pleasurable experiences.&lt;ref name="ohio-state"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.music-cog.ohio-state.edu/Music838/glossary.html#ecstatic%20listening|title=Music Cognition Handbook: A Glossary of Concepts|author=David Huron|publisher=music-cog.ohio-state.edu|accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frisson may be enhanced by the amplitude of the music and the temperature of the environment.

== Neural correlates ==
{{Further|Reward system|Sympathetic nervous system}}

Experimental studies have also shown that tingling during frisson is accompanied by increased [[electrodermal activity]] (skin conductance) – which is mediated via the activation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] – and that the intensity of tingling is positively correlated with the magnitude of sympathetic activation.&lt;ref name="Scientific Reports" /&gt; 
Frisson is also associated with piloerection, [[mydriasis|enlarged pupil diameter]], and physiological arousal, all of which are mediated by activation of the sympathetic nervous system.&lt;ref name="Scientific Reports" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tingling neuropsychophysiology" /&gt;

Neuroimaging studies have found that the intensity of tingling is positively correlated with the magnitude of brain activity in specific regions of the [[reward system]], including the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], and [[insular cortex]].&lt;ref name="Scientific Reports" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tingling neuropsychophysiology" /&gt; All three of these brain structures are known to contain a [[hedonic hotspot]], a region of the brain that is responsible for producing pleasure [[cognition]].&lt;ref name="Pleasure system"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML | title = Pleasure systems in the brain | journal = Neuron | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 646–664 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25950633 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018 | quote = In the prefrontal cortex, recent evidence indicates that the [orbitofrontal cortex] OFC and insula cortex may each contain their own additional hot spots (D.C. Castro et al., Soc. Neurosci., abstract). In specific subregions of each area, either opioid-stimulating or orexin-stimulating microinjections appear to enhance the number of ''liking'' reactions elicited by sweetness, similar to the [nucleus accumbens] NAc and [ventral pallidum] VP hot spots. Successful confirmation of hedonic hot spots in the OFC or insula would be important and possibly relevant to the orbitofrontal mid-anterior site mentioned earlier that especially tracks the subjective pleasure of foods in humans (Georgiadis et al., 2012; Kringelbach, 2005; Kringelbach et al., 2003; Small et al., 2001; Veldhuizen et al., 2010). Finally, in the brainstem, a hindbrain site near the parabrachial nucleus of dorsal pons also appears able to contribute to hedonic gains of function (Söderpalm and Berridge, 2000). A brainstem mechanism for pleasure may seem more surprising than forebrain hot spots to anyone who views the brainstem as merely reflexive, but the pontine parabrachial nucleus contributes to taste, pain, and many visceral sensations from the body and has also been suggested to play an important role in motivation (Wu et al., 2012) and in human emotion (especially related to the somatic marker hypothesis) (Damasio, 2010). | pmc=4425246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mapping brain circuits"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richard JM, Castro DC, Difeliceantonio AG, Robinson MJ, Berridge KC | title = Mapping brain circuits of reward and motivation: in the footsteps of Ann Kelley | journal = Neurosci.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20572">The '''Greenhouse Effect''' is a theory of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justices' behavior, first proposed by [[Hoover Institution]] economist [[Thomas Sowell]] and popularized by [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Court of Appeals]] Senior Judge [[Laurence Silberman]] in a speech to [[The Federalist Society]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Martin Tolchin, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/15/us/press-is-condemned-by-a-federal-judge-for-court-coverage.html Press Is Condemned By a Federal Judge For Court Coverage] ''The New York Times'', 6/15/1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tushnet, Mark.

Norton, 2005, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the word "Greenhouse" refers to [[Linda Greenhouse]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning reporter who covered the Supreme Court for the ''[[New York Times]]'' for 40 years. Silberman used the term to postulate a tendency of conservative [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justices to vote with the liberals more often as their careers progress due to a desire for favorable press coverage. He said "It seems that the primary objective of The Times's legal reporters is to put activist heat on recently appointed Supreme Court justices."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

The existence of the Greenhouse Effect has been challenged by some commentators, who note it presumes a "vast, hegemonic liberal control over the media and academia"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lithwick|first=Dahlia|title=The Souter Factor |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2005/08/the_souter_factor.html|publisher=Slate|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and question whether professional decision makers who have "come to their views despite years of elite education and exposure to elite opinion" are really so malleable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanson|first=Jon|title=The Drifters: Why The Supreme Court Makes Justices More Liberal|url=http://bostonreview.net/BR31.1/hansonbenforado.php|publisher=Boston Review|accessdate=17 April 2012|author2=Adam Benforado}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the evidence below suggests that conservative justices become liberal more often than liberals become conservative. Further, the existence of a more general version of the Greenhouse Effect, one not restricted to the media but rather "elites" in general or legal elites, is less controversial. Though this does not show causation, 75% of law professors who began their careers after 1986 identify as liberal, while only 10% identify as conservative.&lt;ref name="Judges and Their Audiences"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baum |first=Lawrence|title=Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691138275|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests more "elite" journalists identify as liberal than conservative.&lt;ref name="Judges and Their Audiences"/&gt;

==Origins of the theory==

The Greenhouse Effect refers to [[Linda Greenhouse]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning ''[[New York Times]]'' Supreme Court reporter for over three decades, currently a Senior Fellow at [[Yale Law School]]. Greenhouse came under fire from conservatives for publicly espousing liberal viewpoints by participating in a 1989 pro-choice march and in remarks at the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study|Radcliffe Institute]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shafer|first=jack|title=The Gas Over Linda Greenhouse |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2007/08/the_gas_over_linda_greenhouse.html|publisher=Slate|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aronoff|first=Roger|title=The Greenhouse Effect|url=http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/the-greenhouse-effect/|publisher=Accuracy In Media|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calame|first=Byron|title=Hazarding Personal Opinions in Public Can Be Hazardous for Journalists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/opinion/08pubed.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |publisher=New York Times|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenhouse herself commented on the origins of the theory in an interview with NPR:

{{quote|Ms. Wertheimer: In a 1992 speech to the Federalist Society, Lawrence Silberman, who is an appeals court judge, referred to the greenhouse effect. By which he partly meant you, and he partly meant activist heat, he said, that the Times legal reporters put on recently appointed justices to try to influence their opinions. It certainly did kind of single you out as being an influential player in the world of the court.

Ms. Greenhouse: Well, Judge Silberman is giving credit for coming up with that snarky phrase, but actually, he swiped it off from Tom Bethell, the economist, who had put it in a column shortly before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wertheimer|first=Linda|title=Supreme Court Reporter Linda Greenhouse Retires|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92489115|publisher=NPR|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is unclear whether Ms. Greenhouse meant to refer to Mr. Bethell or Mr. Sowell. Mr. Bethell, an editor at the ''[[American Spectator]]'' and another [[Hoover Institution]] fellow, started the "Strange New Respect Awards", which are given to conservatives who have become more liberal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pleszczynski|first=Wlady|title=Strange New Respect|url=http://spectator.org/blog/2007/03/05/strange-new-respect|publisher=American Spectator|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ms. Greenhouse is said by some to have inspired the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Scott|title=An Exceedingly Strange New Respect|url=http://www.looktruenorth.com/limited-government/49-conservatism/5837-an-exceedingly-strange-new-respect.html|publisher=Look True North}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Sowell is more often cited as the origin of the name of the theory.

==Example commentary incorporating the theory==

[[Pat Buchanan]], a conservative political commentator, wrote the passage below, after quoting Linda Greenhouse in reference to Justice [[John Paul Stevens]]' advocating for a reconsideration of the death penalty in ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'':

{{quote|For his defection to the abolitionist camp, the 88-year-old justice was rewarded with her patented deep massage by Linda Greenhouse, the veteran — and after 30 years retiring — Supreme Court reporter of The New York Times: "When Justice John Paul Stevens intervened in a Supreme Court argument on Wednesday to score a few points off the lawyer who was defending the death penalty for the rape of a child, the courtroom audience saw a master strategist at work, fully in command of the flow of the argument and the smallest details of the case. For those accustomed to watching Justice Stevens, it was a familiar sight." ... But had Stevens moved from left to right, rather than the reverse, one imagines Greenhouse's enthusiasm for the "master strategist" would have been well contained. What we see here is a textbook example of what U.S. Judge Laurence Silberman calls "The Greenhouse Effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Patrick |title=The Greenhouse Effect|url=http://buchanan.org/blog/pjb-the-greenhouse-effect-982|publisher=Patrick Buchanan|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==The Supreme Court and the media==

Supreme Court author, Larry Berkson, holds that the Supreme Court has two audiences: the highly attentive legal profession and the less engaged general public.&lt;ref name=Berkson&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkson|first=Larry|title=The Supreme Court and Its Publics|year=1978 |publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lexington, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;   If the Supreme Court is without the general public's backing, its authority may be eroded. However, the Court must remain independent of the ongoing political process. Richard Davis discusses this relationship with the Court and the public as, "the paradox of imagemaking – to engage in imagemaking while denying its existence to maintain the image."&lt;ref name=Davis9&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Richard|title=Decisions and Images: The Supreme Court and the Press |year=1994 |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-034505-9|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the majority of the general public does not have the time, interest or expertise to read the opinions for themselves, they must depend on newspapers, periodicals, radio and TV for its information.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite news|last=Warren|first=Earl |title=Statement on Special committee of Supreme Court Decisions|date=September 12, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Justices have also been known to survey reporters to determine if they were interpreting their opinions as intended.  In these ways and more the Court also tried to shape the way the media covers the justices and their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|title=The Problem of Journalism: a political economic contribution to an explanation of the crisis in contemporary US journalism|year=2003 |volume=4 |issue=3|pages=229–329 |url=http://www.studiogaijin.org/iserlohn/wien/klasse/fernsehen/p299_s.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court also receives news of the public's reactions to its decisions through the press. Some scholars have postulated that swing justices, who have disproportionate influence over the court, may be more attuned to public opinion since their own policy preferences are weaker than their colleagues.&lt;ref name=Davis17-18&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Richard|title=Decisions and Images: The Supreme Court and the Press|year=1994 |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc. |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-034505-9|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States|demographics of the Supreme Court]] reveal that Justices tend to be more highly educated and wealthy relative to the rest of the nation. In 2007, 7 of the 9 justices had a net worth of over a million dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Becker|first=Bernie|title=Justices List Their Assets; Wide Range of Wealth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/07/washington/07scotus.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and all of the justices attended an [[Ivy League]] law school.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Social psychology|Social psychological theory]] holds that we seek approval from those similar to us, and those we interact with more often. In the court's case, this means Justices may be more influenced by elites than by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baum|first=Lawrence|author2=Neal Devins|title=Why the Supreme Court Cares About Elites, Not the American People|journal=Georgetown Law Journal|year=2010|volume=98|pages=1515–1581|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1116|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical evidence of the effect's existence==

Regardless of the cause, it is well established that many Supreme Court Justices exhibit sizable shifts in voting patterns over their careers, much more so than would be expected for experienced jurists who are chosen for life service on the nation's highest court.&lt;ref name="Epstein 2007 1483–1542"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Lee |author2=Andrew D. Martin |author3=Kevin M. Quinn |author4=Jeffrey A. Segal|title=Ideological Drift Among Supreme Court Justices: Who, When and How Important?|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=2007|volume=101|issue=4|pages=1483–1542|url=http://epstein.usc.edu/research/ideodrift.pdf|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence Baum found some evidence that supports the effect's existence. However, the research is not definitive at this point in time, as it is hampered by the small sample size of Supreme Court justices in the modern era. Furthermore, it is important to note that much of Baum's research focuses on the influence of "elite" opinion, not just the media. However, the evidence for the influence of "elite" opinion is more robust than the evidence for media specifically.

''[[Amicus curiae]]'' briefs and law review articles can influence the court by providing precedents or reasoning to support a position. In ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'' the court overturned the precedent relating to school prayer that it had established in ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]'' just three years earlier, ruling that students did not have to salute the flag, which was applauded by liberals. Notably, 31 out of the 39 law review articles commenting on Gobitis condemned the decision. Justice [[Hugo Black]] was said by Justice [[William O. Douglas]] to have changed his mind because "he had been reading the papers".&lt;ref name="Judges and Their Audiences c"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baum|first=Lawrence|title=Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691138275|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', an affirmative action case, 83 out of the 102 ''amicus'' briefs supported affirmative action, and briefs filed by "elites" such as Fortune 500 companies, colleges, and states displayed even higher levels for support for affirmative action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baum|first=Lawrence|author2=Neal Devins|title=Why the Supreme Court Cares About Elites, Not the American People |journal=Georgetown Law Journal|year=2010|volume=98|pages=1567|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1116|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Gannett Co. v. Depasquale]]'' the court held that the 6th Amendment didn't guarantee public access to trials. The media erupted in a firestorm of criticism, prompting four Justices to make public statements about the meaning of the case. However, one year later, the court reversed itself in ''[[Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia]]''.&lt;ref name="Judges and Their Audiences b"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baum|first=Lawrence|title=Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691138275|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the modern era and in a variety of cases, Supreme Court decisions better reflect the opinions of the highly educated than general public opinion. For example, in 1964, 41.4% of those with post-graduate degrees agreed with the court's position on school prayer compared to only 14.9% of those with lower levels of education.&lt;ref name="Baum 2010 1571"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baum|first=Lawrence |author2=Neal Devins|title=Why the Supreme Court Cares About Elites, Not the American People|journal=Georgetown Law Journal|year=2010 |volume=98|pages=1571|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1116|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an equivalent gulf for ''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'', the 1990 decision concerning flag burning.&lt;ref name="Baum 2010 1571"/&gt; In 2003, in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which legalized homosexual intercourse in states that had anti-sodomy laws, 75% of people with post-graduate degrees agreed with the court, whereas 51% of those with lower levels of education agreed.&lt;ref name="Baum 2010 1571"/&gt;

Some of the strongest empirical evidence concerns the difference between conservative Justices who lived in [[Washington, D.C.]] before they were nominated and those who did not. The evidence from the modern era is summarized in the table below. The table displays the change in pro-civil liberties votes from Justice's early terms and later terms. A higher percentage of pro-civil liberties votes is generally regarded as more liberal.

==Notable affected justices==

Only four of the twenty-six Justices serving since 1937 remained relatively stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Lee |author2=Andrew D. Martin |author3=Kevin M. Quinn |author4=Jeffrey A. Segal|title=IDEOLOGICAL DRIFT AMONG SUPREME COURT JUSTICES: WHO, WHEN, AND HOW IMPORTANT?|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=2007|volume=101|issue=4|url=http://epstein.usc.edu/research/ideodrift.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] was famously said to have "evolved" over his career, becoming much more liberal in later decades; Linda Greenhouse herself wrote an article about Blackmun called "The Evolution of A Justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|title=The Evolution of a Justice|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/10/magazine/10BLACKMUN.html|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably, he wrote the opinion in favor of legalizing abortion in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. This is despite the fact that President [[Richard Nixon]] asked Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] if "he could resist the Washington cocktail party circuit" before his nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baum|first=Lawrence|title=Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691138275|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other Republican presidents' nominees shifted to the left, such as Brennan, O'Connor, Souter and Stevens.&lt;ref name="Epstein 2007 1483–1542"/&gt;  Some justices have shifted to the right, such as [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[Byron White]], but on the whole in the modern era there have been more shifts to the left than the right. Frankfurter began his career in the 1938 term as a slightly left-of-center Justice, closer to the term's likely median. Virtually from the start of his second term, however, Frankfurter appears to have drifted right. By the conclusion of his tenure, Frankfurter was second only to John M. Harlan II as the Court's most extreme conservative voter; he actually ended his service more firmly planted on the right than Chief Justice Rehnquist.&lt;ref name="Epstein 2007 1483–1542"/&gt;  Justice Black's movement to the right was not missed by some commentators. As James F. Simon once wrote, Black's "increasingly brittle, unmistakably conservative tilt" actually proved embarrassing to many of his admirers.&lt;ref name="Epstein 2007 1483–1542"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon|first=James|title=Judging the Justices|year=1994|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|jstor=1229375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of sitting justices as of 2012, Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] is noted for having become much more liberal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trapp|first=Mark|title=Kennedy's Benchmarks|url=http://spectator.org/archives/2004/07/14/kennedys-benchmarks|publisher=American Spectator|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy had been expected to be the swing vote overturning ''Roe v. Wade'' in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', but instead voted to uphold it, with the evidence suggesting he changed his mind between conference and the final vote.&lt;ref name="Eastland 1993 32"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eastland|first=Terry|title=The Tempting of Justice Kennedy|journal=The American Spectator|date=February 1993|volume=26|issue=2|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy had previously changed his mind in ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'', concerning school prayer. Kennedy has been observed to be concerned with how he will go down in history. In an interview given just minutes before Casey was handed down, he said "Sometimes you don't know if you're Caesar about to cross the Rubicon or Captain Queeg cutting your own tow line." Kennedy displays the concern with his historical image that would lend credence to the Greenhouse Effect, for example by having his clerks clip all news stories about him.&lt;ref name="Eastland 1993 32"/&gt;

'''Gynodioecy''' is a rare breeding system that is found in certain flowering plant species in which female and hermaphroditic plants coexist within a population. Gynodioecy is the evolutionary intermediate stage between [[hermaphroditism]] (exhibiting both female and male parts) and [[dioecy]] (having two distinct morphs: male and female). Gynodioecy is the opposite of [[androdioecy]], which is a breeding system consisting of male and hermaphroditic plants in a population. Gynodioecy occurs as a result of a genetic mutation that inhibits a hermaphroditic plant from producing pollen, while keeping the female reproductive parts intact. Gynodioecy is extremely rare, with fewer than 1% of angiosperm species exhibiting the breeding system. Some notable species that exhibit a gynodioecious mating system include ''[[Beta vulgaris]]'' (wild beet), ''[[Lobelia siphilitica]]'', ''[[Silene]]'', and [[Lamiaceae]].

== Evolution of Gynodioecy ==
Gynodioecy is often referred to as the evolutionary intermediate state between hermaphroditism and dioecy. Gynodioecy has been investigated by biologists dating as far back as to [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name="Touzet2012"/&gt; Gynodioecy can evolve from hermaphroditism due to certain environmental factors. If enough resources in a population are allocated to the female functions in a hermaphroditic species, gynodioecy will ensue. On the other hand, if more of those resources are divvied up to favor a hermaphrodite’s male functions, androdioecy will result. A high rate of [[self-pollination]] in a population facilitates the maintenance of gynodioecy by increasing the inbreeding costs for hermaphrodites.&lt;ref name="Sinclair2016"/&gt; Thus, as the rate of inbreeding increases in a population, the more likely gynodioecy is to occur.

Since hermaphrodites can reproduce on their own, they are referred to as being self-compatible. On the contrary, non-hermaphroditic plants are [[self-incompatible]]. Research has shown that a species can be either gynodioecious or self-incompatible, but very rarely is there a co-occurrence between the two. Therefore, gynodioecy and self-incompatibility tend to prevent each other’s maintenance. Self-incompatibility of plants helps maintain androdioecy in plants, since males are in competition with only hermaphrodites to sire ovules. Self-incompatibility leads to a loss in gynodioecy, since neither hermaphrodites nor females have to deal with [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name="VandePaer2015"/&gt;

Two scenarios have been proposed to explain the evolutionary dynamics of the maintenance of gynodioecy. The first scenario, known as the balancing selection theory, considers the genetic factors that control gynodioecy over long evolutionary time scales. The balancing selection leads to cycles that explain the normal sex ratios in gynodioecious populations. The second scenario, known as epidemic dynamics, involves the arrival and loss of new cytoplasmic male sterility genes in new populations. These are the same genes that invade hermaphrodite populations and eventually result in gynodioecy.&lt;ref name="Touzet2012"/&gt;

== Determination of Gynodioecy ==
Gynodioecy is determined as a result of a genetic mutation that stops a plant from producing pollen, but still allows normal female reproductive features.&lt;ref name="Preece2010"/&gt; In plants, nuclear genes are inherited from both parents, but all the cytoplasmic genes come from the mother. This holds true in order to compensate for male gametes being smaller and more motile while female gametes are larger. It makes sense for most plants to be hermaphrodites, since they are sessile and unable to find mates as easily as animals can.&lt;ref name="Ridley1993"/&gt;

Cytoplasmic male sterility genes, usually found in the mitochondrial genome, show up and are established when female fertility is just slightly more than the hermaphroditic fertility. The female only needs to make slightly more or better seeds than hermaphrodites since the mitochondrial genome is maternally inherited.&lt;ref name="Delph2007"/&gt; Research done on plants has shown that hermaphroditic plants are in constant battles against organelle genes trying to kill their male parts. In over 140 plant species, these “male killer” genes have been observed. Male sterility genes cause plants to grow anthers that are stunted or withered and as a result, do not produce pollen. In most plants, there are nuclear fertility restoring genes that counteract the work of the male sterility genes, maintaining the hermaphroditic state of the plant. However, in some species of plants, the male sterility genes win the battle over the nuclear fertility restoring genes, and gynodioecy occurs.&lt;ref name="Ridley1993"/&gt;

[[Maize]] farmers take advantage of gynodioecy to produce favorable hybrid maize seeds. The farmers deliberately make use of the gynodioecy that develops in the maize, resulting in a population of male-sterile and female-fertile individuals. They then introduce a new strain of male-sterile individuals and the breeders are able to collect the more favorable hybrid seeds.&lt;ref name="Ridley1993"/&gt;

== Rarity ==
Gynodioecy is a rare, but widely distributed sexual system in angiosperm species. Gynodioecy is found in at least 81 different angiosperm families. Of all the angiosperms on Earth, less than 1% of them are gynodioecious species.&lt;ref name="Rivkin2016"/&gt; One likely explanation for its rarity is due to its limited evolution. Since females are at a disadvantage when compared to hermaphrodites, they will never be able to evolve as quickly. In addition, gynodioecy is rare because the mechanism that favor females and cause gynodioecy in some populations only operate in some plant lineages, but not others.

The reason for this variation in the rarity of gynodioecy stems from certain phenotypic traits or ecological factors that promote and favor the presence of female plants in a population. For example, a herbaceous growth form is much more highly favored in gynodioecious species of [[Lamiaceae]] as compared to woody lineages.&lt;ref name="Rivkin2016"/&gt; Herbaceous growth form is also associated with a reduced pollen limitation and an increased self-fertilization. A reduced pollen limitation may decrease seed quantity and quality. Woody growth form Lamiaceae are more pollen-limited, and thus, produce less seeds and seeds of lower quality, thus favoring the female herbaceous growth form.&lt;ref name="Rivkin2016"/&gt; Gynodioecy is rare because some sexual systems are more evolutionary liable to change in certain lineages as compared to others.

== Maintenance of Gynodioecy ==
The maintenance of gynodioecy at first may seem like a mystery. Theoretically, hermaphrodites should have the evolutionary and reproductive advantage over females in a population because they naturally can produce more offspring. Hermaphrodites can transmit their genes through both pollen and ovules, whereas females can only transmit genes via ovules. Thus, in order for females to remain viable in a population, they would have to be twice as successful as hermaphrodites.

It would appear that gynodioecy should not persist. In order for it to be maintained, the females need to have some sort of a reproductive advantage over the hermaphroditic population, known as female compensation or female advantage.&lt;ref name="Touzet2012"/&gt; Female advantage includes an increase in saved energy from not producing pollen and making seedlings of higher quality, since hermaphrodite seedlings are susceptible to homozygous deleterious alleles. Additional advantages include more flowers, higher fruit set, higher total seed production, heavier seeds, and better germination rates.

Individualism makes the individual its focus&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; and so starts "with the fundamental premise that the human individual is of primary importance in the struggle for liberation."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Classical liberalism]], [[existentialism]], and [[anarchism]] are examples of movements that take the human individual as a central unit of analysis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[L. Susan Brown]]. ''[[The Politics of Individualism: Liberalism, Liberal Feminism, and Anarchism]]''. Black Rose Books Ltd. 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Individualism thus involves "the right of the individual to freedom and self-realization".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ellen Meiksins Wood]]. ''Mind and Politics: An Approach to the Meaning of Liberal and Socialist Individualism''. [[University of California Press]]. 1972.  {{ISBN|0-520-02029-4}} pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been used as a term denoting "The quality of being an individual; individuality"&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"/&gt; related to possessing "An individual characteristic; a [[Idiosyncrasy|quirk]]."&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"/&gt; Individualism is thus also associated with [[artistic]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] interests and lifestyles where there is a tendency towards self-creation and experimentation as opposed to tradition or popular mass opinions and behaviors,&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bohemia: The Underworld of Art"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Snyderman |first1=George S. |last2=Josephs |first2=William |title=Bohemia: The Underworld of Art |journal=Social Forces |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=187–199 |date=1939 |doi=10.2307/2570771 |issn=0037-7732 |jstor=2570771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as with [[humanism|humanist]] philosophical positions and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;"The leading intellectual trait of the era was the recovery, to a certain degree, of the secular and humane philosophy of Greece and Rome. Another humanist trend which cannot be ignored was the rebirth of individualism, which, developed by Greece and Rome to a remarkable degree, had been suppressed by the rise of a caste system in the later Roman Empire, by the Church and by feudalism in the Middle Ages.[http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/humanism.html "The history guide: Lectures on Modern European Intellectual History"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Anthropocentricity and individualism...Humanism and Italian art were similar in giving paramount attention to human experience, both in its everyday immediacy and in its positive or negative extremes...The human-centredness of Renaissance art, moreover, was not just a generalized endorsement of earthly experience. Like the humanists, Italian artists stressed the autonomy and dignity of the individual."[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/275932/humanism/11824/Anthropocentricity-and-individualism "Humanism" on Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the [[English language]], the word "individualism" was first introduced, as a pejorative, by the [[Owenism|Owenites]] in the late 1830s, although it is unclear if they were influenced by [[Saint-Simonianism]] or came up with it independently.&lt;ref name="Claeys"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Claeys, Gregory |authorlink=Gregory Claeys |title="Individualism," "Socialism," and "Social Science": Further Notes on a Process of Conceptual Formation, 1800–1850 |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |year=1986 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=81–93 |doi=10.2307/2709596|jstor=2709596|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more positive use of the term in Britain came to be used with the writings of [[James Elishama Smith]], who was a [[millenarian]] and a [[Christian Israelite]]. Although an early [[Robert Owen|Owenite]] socialist, he eventually rejected its collective idea of property, and found in individualism a "universalism" that allowed for the development of the "original genius." Without individualism, Smith argued, individuals cannot amass property to increase one's happiness.&lt;ref name="Claeys"/&gt; [[William Maccall]], another [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] preacher, and probably an acquaintance of Smith, came somewhat later, although influenced by [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], and [[Romanticism|German Romanticism]], to the same positive conclusions, in his 1847 work "Elements of Individualism".&lt;ref name="Swart"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Swart, Koenraad W. |author-link=Koenraad W. Swart |title="Individualism" in the Mid-Nineteenth Century (1826–1860) |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |year=1962 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=77–90 |doi=10.2307/2708058|jstor=2708058|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The individual==
{{Main|Individual}}
An individual is a person or any specific object in a collection. In the 15th century and earlier, and also today within the fields of [[statistics]] and [[metaphysics]], individual means "indivisible", typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning "a person." (q.v. "The problem of [[proper name]]s"). From the 17th century on, individual indicates separateness, as in individualism.&lt;ref&gt;Abbs 1986, cited in Klein 2005, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Individuality is the state or quality of being an individuated being; a person separated from everything with unique character by possessing his or her own needs, goals, and desires in comparison to other persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald N. Izenberg|title=Impossible Individuality: Romanticism, Revolution, and the Origins of Modern Selfhood, 1787-1802|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ60DyQi8mYC&amp;pg=PA18|date=3 June 1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2066-9|pages=18+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individuation principle  ===
{{main|Individuation}}
The principle of individuation
, or ''{{lang|la|principium individuationis}}'',&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion |last=Reese |first=William L. |edition=1st |year=1980 |publisher=Humanities Press |location=Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey |isbn=0-391-00688-6 |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the manner in which a thing is identified as distinguished from other things.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |editor1-last= Audi |editor1-first=Robert |edition= 2nd |year= 1999|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-63136-X |page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Carl Jung]], individuation is a process of transformation, whereby the personal and [[collective unconscious]] is brought into consciousness (by means of dreams, [[active imagination]] or [[free association (psychology)|free association]] to takexamples) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche to take place.&lt;ref name="jung1"&gt;Jung, C. G. (1962). Symbols of Transformation: An analysis of the prelude to a case of schizophrenia (Vol. 2, R. F. C. Hull, Trans.). New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Jung considered individuation to be the central process of human development.&lt;ref name="Jung's Individuation process"&gt;[http://soultherapynow.com/articles/individuation.html Jung's Individuation process] Retrieved on 2009-2-20&lt;/ref&gt; In ''L'individuation psychique et collective'', [[Gilbert Simondon]] developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending [[Process philosophy|ontological process]] of individuation. Individuation is an always incomplete process, always leaving a "pre-individual" left-over, itself making possible future individuations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Simondon]]. ''L'individuation psychique et collective'' (Paris, Aubier, 1989; reprinted in 2007 with a preface by Bernard Stiegler)&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of [[Bernard Stiegler]] draws upon and modifies the work of [[Gilbert Simondon]] on individuation and also upon similar ideas in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. For Stiegler "the ''I'', as a psychic individual, can only be thought in relationship to ''we'', which is a collective individual. The ''I'' is constituted in adopting a collective tradition, which it inherits and in which a plurality of ''I''&amp;nbsp;'s acknowledge each other's existence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/bernard-stiegler-culture-and-technology Bernard Stiegler: Culture and Technology], tate.org.uk, 13 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individualism and society==
Individualism holds that a person taking part in society attempts to learn and discover what his or her own interests are on a personal basis, without a presumed following of the interests of a societal structure (an individualist need not be an [[Egotism|egoist]]). The individualist does not follow one particular philosophy, rather creates an amalgamation of elements of many, based on personal interests in particular aspects that he/she finds of use. On a societal level, the individualist participates on a personally structured political and moral ground. Independent thinking and opinion is a common trait of an individualist. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], claims that his concept of "[[general will]]" in the "[[Social Contract (Rousseau)|social contract]]" is not the simple collection of individual wills and that it furthers the interests of the individual (the constraint of law itself would be beneficial for the individual, as the lack of respect for the law necessarily entails, in Rousseau's eyes, a form of [[ignorance]] and submission to one's [[Passion (emotion)|passions]] instead of the preferred [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] of [[reason]]).

Societies and groups can differ in the extent to which they are based upon predominantly "self-regarding" (individualistic, and/or self-interested) behaviors, rather than "other-regarding" (group-oriented, and group, or society-minded) behaviors. [[Ruth Benedict]] made a distinction, relevant in this context, between [[Guilt society|"guilt" societies]] (e.g., [[medieval Europe]]) with an "internal reference standard", and [[Shame society|"shame" societies]] (e.g., Japan, "bringing shame upon one's ancestors") with an "external reference standard", where people look to their peers for feedback on whether an action is "acceptable" or not.&lt;ref&gt;"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword: Patterns of Japanese Culture." Rutland, VT and Tokyo, Japan: Charles E. Tuttle Co. 1954 orig. 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individualism is often contrasted&lt;ref name="Hayek 1994 17, 37–48"/&gt; either with [[totalitarianism]] or with [[collectivism]], but in fact, there is a spectrum of behaviors at the societal level ranging from highly individualistic societies through mixed societies to collectivist.

===Methodological individualism===
[[Methodological individualism]] is the view that phenomena can only be understood by examining how they result from the motivations and actions of individual agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/methodological-individualism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Joseph|last=Heath|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In economics, people's behavior is explained in terms of rational choices, as constrained by prices and incomes. The economist accepts individuals' preferences as givens. [[Gary Becker|Becker]] and [[George Stigler|Stigler]] provide a forceful statement of this view:&lt;blockquote&gt;On the traditional view, an explanation of economic phenomena that reaches a difference in tastes between people or times is the terminus of the argument: the problem is abandoned at this point to whoever studies and explains tastes (psychologists? anthropologists? phrenologists? sociobiologists?). On our preferred interpretation, one never reaches this impasse: the economist continues to search for differences in prices or incomes to explain any differences or changes in behavior.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stigler|first=George|author2=Gary Becker|date=Mar 1977|title=De gustibus non est disputandum|journal=American Economic Review|volume=67|issue=2|page=76|jstor=1807222}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Competitive individualism===
It is a form of individualism that arises from competitive systems. The function of the system is to maintain an inequality in the society and fields of human engagement. This pins the ups and downs of a person's life onto themselves by not acknowledging a range of factors like influence of socioeconomic class, race, gender, etc. It supports the privilege theories that affirms position of certain individuals higher in the hierarchy of ranks at the expense of others. For better individuality cooperation is considered to be a better remedy for personal growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nancy Schniedewind|author2=Ellen Davidson|title=Open Minds to Equality: A Sourcebook of Learning Activities to Affirm Diversity and Promote Equity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nbc1aqFD88cC&amp;pg=PA23|year=2006|publisher=Rethinking Schools|isbn=978-0-942961-32-4|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political individualism==
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism. Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.|source=[[Oscar Wilde]], ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'', 1891}}

Individualists are chiefly concerned with protecting individual autonomy against obligations imposed by social institutions (such as the state or religious morality). For [[L. Susan Brown]] "Liberalism and anarchism are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual [[Freedom of will|freedom]] yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Civil libertarianism]] is a strain of political thought that supports civil liberties, or which emphasizes the supremacy of [[individual rights]] and [[personal freedom]]s over and against any kind of authority (such as a [[State (polity)|state]], a [[corporation]], social norms imposed through [[peer pressure]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/civil%20libertarian?r=14|title=the definition of civil libertarian|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil libertarianism is not a complete [[ideology]]; rather, it is a collection of views on the specific issues of [[civil liberties]] and [[civil rights]]. Because of this, a civil libertarian outlook is compatible with many other political philosophies, and civil libertarianism is found on both the [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left]] in modern politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalcompass.org/analysis2|title=The Political Compass|first=The Political|last=Compass|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For scholar [[Ellen Meiksins Wood]] "there are doctrines of individualism that are opposed to [[John Locke|Lockean individualism]] ... and non-lockean individualism may encompass [[socialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ellen Meiksins Wood]]. ''Mind and Politics: An Approach to the Meaning of Liberal and Socialist Individualism''. [[University of California Press]]. 1972.  {{ISBN|0-520-02029-4}}. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

British Historians Emily Robinson, Camilla Schofield, Florence Sutcliffe-Braithwaite, and Natalie Thomlinson have argued that by the 1970s Britons were keen about defining and claiming their individual rights, identities and perspectives.  They demanded greater personal autonomy and self-determination and less outside control. They angrily complained that the 'establishment' was withholding it.  They argue this shift in concerns helped cause [[Thatcherism]], and was incorporated into Thatcherism's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Robinson, et al. "Telling stories about post-war Britain:  popular individualism and the 'crisis' of the 1970s." ''Twentieth Century British History'' 28.2 (2017): 268-304.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberalism===
{{main|Liberalism}}
{{Liberalism sidebar |Ideas}}
Liberalism (from the Latin ''liberalis'', "of freedom; worthy of a free man, gentlemanlike, courteous, generous")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=liberalis&amp;ending=|title=Latin Word Lookup|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the belief in the importance of individual freedom. This belief is widely accepted in the United States, Europe, Australia and other [[Western world|Western]] nations, and was recognized as an important value by many Western philosophers throughout history, in particular since [[the Enlightenment]]. It is often rejected by collectivist, Islamic, or [[confucian]] societies in [[Asia]] or the [[Middle East]] (though [[Taoist]]s were and are known to be individualists).&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Chinese Super State of Primary Societies: Taoist Philosophy for the 21st Century, You-Sheng Li, June 2010, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] wrote praising "the idea of a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius, ''Meditations'', Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954059-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For all intents and purposes, liberalism here refers to classical liberalism and should not be confused with [[modern liberalism in the United States]],.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Goodman, {{cite web|url=http://www.goodmaninstitute.org/how-we-think/classical-liberalism-vs-modern-liberalism-and-modern-conservatism/|title=Classical Liberalism vs Modern Liberalism and Modern Conservatism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism has its roots in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and rejects many [[Foundationalism|foundational]] assumptions that dominated most earlier theories of government, such as the [[Divine Right of Kings]], hereditary status, and [[state religion|established religion]]. [[John Locke]] is often credited with the philosophical foundations of [[classical liberalism]]. He wrote "no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions."&lt;ref name = "locke"&gt;{{cite book | last = Locke | first = John | title = Two Treatises of Government (10th edition) | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]] | year = 1690 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/trgov10h.htm | accessdate = January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, liberal ideas began to influence governments in Europe, in nations such as The Netherlands, Switzerland, England and Poland, but they were strongly opposed, often by armed might, by those who favored absolute monarchy and established religion. In the 18th century, in America, the first modern liberal state was founded, without a monarch or a hereditary aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Sigmund, editor, ''The Selected Political Writings of John Locke'', Norton, 2003, {{ISBN|0-393-96451-5}} p. iv "(Locke's thoughts) underlie many of the fundamental political ideas of American liberal constitutional democracy...", "At the time Locke wrote, his principles were accepted in theory by a few and in practice by none."&lt;/ref&gt; The American ''Declaration of Independence'' includes the words (which echo Locke) "all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are [[life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]]; that to insure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]]."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, ''Declaration of Independence'', July 4, 1776.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism comes in many forms. According to [[John N. Gray]], the essence of liberalism is toleration of different beliefs and of different ideas as to what constitutes a good life.&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, ''Two Faces of Liberalism'', The New Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-56584-678-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx."

For influential Italian anarchist [[Errico Malatesta]] "All anarchists, whatever tendency they belong to, are individualists in some way or other. But the opposite is not true; not by any means. The individualists are thus divided into two distinct categories: one which claims the right to full development for all human individuality, their own and that of others; the other which only thinks about its own individuality and has absolutely no hesitation in sacrificing the individuality of others. The Tsar of all the Russias belongs to the latter category of individualists.

====Individualist anarchism====
{{Main|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name="ryner"&gt;"What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, [[loss of tradition|no tradition]], no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience."[https://www.marxists.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tucker"&gt;"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself." "Anarchism and the State" in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

In 1793, [[William Godwin]], who has often&lt;ref&gt;Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; been cited as the first anarchist, wrote ''[[Political Justice]]'', which some consider to be the first expression of anarchism.&lt;ref name="godwinsep" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;
Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=godwin |title=William Godwin |last=Philip  |first=Mark|date=2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J.

Godwin advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica Concise Encyclopedia''.

Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX."[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "Voluntary non-submission.

He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later [[Benjamin Tucker]] fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

==Philosophical individualism==

===Ethical egoism===
{{Main|Ethical egoism}}
Ethical egoism (also called simply egoism)&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Steven M. Is egoism morally defensible? Philosophia. Springer Netherlands. Volume 18, Numbers 2–3 / July 1988&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] position that [[moral agent]]s ought to do what is in their own [[wikt:self-interest|self-interest]]. It differs from [[psychological egoism]], which claims that [[people]] ''do'' only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from [[rational egoism]], which holds merely that it is [[rationality|rational]] to act in one's self-interest. However, these doctrines may occasionally be combined with ethical egoism.

Ethical egoism contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an [[obligation]] to help and serve others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical utilitarianism, which holds that a moral agent should treat one's [[self (philosophy)|self]] (also known as [[subject (philosophy)|the subject]]) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and "the self" to a status not granted to others), but that one also should not (as altruism does) sacrifice one's own interests to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own [[desire (philosophy)|desires]] or [[well-being]]) are substantially-equivalent to the others' interests and well-being. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of [[consequentialism]], but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focused]] forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or [[subjectivity|subjective]]), but utilitarianism is called agent-neutral (i.e. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[impartial]]) as it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral "agent's") own interests as being more or less important than if the same interests, desires, or well-being were anyone else's.

Ethical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others. Individualism allows for others' interest and well-being to be disregarded or not, as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying the self-interest of the agent. Nor does ethical egoism necessarily [[logical consequence|entail]] that, in pursuing self-interest, one ought always to do what one wants to do; e.g. in the long term, the fulfilment of short-term desires may prove detrimental to the self. Fleeting pleasance, then, takes a back seat to protracted [[eudaemonia]]. In the words of [[James Rachels]], "Ethical egoism [...] endorses selfishness, but it doesn't endorse foolishness."&lt;ref name="Rachels 2008, p. 534"&gt;Rachels 2008, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stirner02.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature of [[Max Stirner]] taken from a sketch by [[Friedrich Engels]]. Egoist philosopher Max Stirner has been called a proto-[[existentialist]] philosopher while at the same time is a central theorist of individualist anarchism]]
Ethical egoism is sometimes the philosophical basis for support of [[libertarianism]] or individualist anarchism as in Max Stirner, although these can also be based on altruistic motivations.&lt;ref name=ridgely&gt;{{cite web

===Existentialism===
{{Main|Existentialism}}
Existentialism is a term applied to the work of a number of [[19th century philosophy|19th-]] and [[20th century philosophy|20th-century philosophers]] who, despite profound doctrinal differences,&lt;ref&gt;Macquarrie, John. ''Existentialism'', New York (1972), pp. 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', ed. Ted Honderich, New York (1995), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; generally held that the focus of philosophical thought should be to deal with the conditions of existence of the individual person and his or her emotions, actions, responsibilities, and thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Macquarrie. ''Existentialism'', pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, D. E. ''Existentialism: A Reconstruction'' (Basil Blackwell, 1999, p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; The early 19th century philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], posthumously regarded as the father of existentialism,&lt;ref&gt;Marino, Gordon. ''Basic Writings of Existentialism'' (Modern Library, 2004, pp. ix, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that the individual solely has the responsibilities of giving one's own life [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] and living that life [[Authenticity (philosophy)|passionately and sincerely]],&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard'' (Oneworld, 2003, pp. 4–6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, Walter. ''Kierkegaard's attack upon "Christendom"'' (Princeton, 1968, pp. 37–40)&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of many existential obstacles and distractions including [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Despair|despair]], [[angst]], [[Absurdism|absurdity]], [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Alienation|alienation]], and [[boredom]].&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, John. ''The Oxford handbook of religion and emotion'' (Oxford, 2008, pp. 387–88)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent existential philosophers retain the emphasis on the individual, but differ, in varying degrees, on how one achieves and what constitutes a fulfilling life, what obstacles must be overcome, and what external and internal factors are involved, including the potential consequences of the [[Christian existentialism|existence]]&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, James et al. ''Modern Christian Thought: The Twentieth Century'' (Fortress Press, 2006, Chapter 5: Christian Existentialism).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Clancy.

Cooper ''Existentialism: A Reconstruction'' (Basil Blackwell, 1999, p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt; Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Introduction to Modern Existentialism'', New York (1962), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufmann, ''Existentialism: From Dostoevesky to Sartre'', New York (1956), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialism became fashionable after [[World War II]] as a way to reassert the importance of human individuality and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Guignon, Charles B. and Derk Pereboom. ''Existentialism: basic writings'' (Hackett Publishing, 2001, p. xiii)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freethought===
{{Main|Freethought}}
Freethought holds that individuals should not accept ideas proposed as [[truth]] without recourse to knowledge and [[reason]]. Thus, freethinkers strive to build their opinions on the basis of [[fact]]s, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry]], and [[logic]]al principles, independent of any logical [[fallacy|fallacies]] or intellectually limiting effects of authority, [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[prejudice]], [[sect]]arianism, [[tradition]], [[urban legend]], and all other [[dogma]]s. Regarding [[religion]], freethinkers hold that there is insufficient evidence to scientifically validate the existence of [[supernatural]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, James. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAwwaxdKMNAC Encyclopedia of Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanism===
{{Main|Humanism}}
Humanism is a perspective common to a wide range of [[ethics|ethical stances]] that attaches importance to human dignity, concerns, and capabilities, particularly rationality. Although the word has many senses, its meaning comes into focus when contrasted to the supernatural or to appeals to authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|quote=humanism ''n.'' 1 a rationalistic system of thought attaching prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters. 2 a Renaissance cultural movement that turned away from medieval scholasticism and revived interest in ancient Greek and Roman thought.|publication-date = 2007}} Typically, abridgments of this definition omit all senses except #1, such as in the [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=38402&amp;dict=CALD Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary], [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/humanism Collins Essential English Dictionary], and {{cite book|title=Webster's Concise Dictionary|publisher=RHR Press|year = 2001|location=New York|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of humanism (subsection) |publisher=Institute for Humanist Studies |url=http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |accessdate=16 Jan 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118050402/http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |archivedate=2007-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century, humanism has been associated with an anti-clericalism inherited from the 18th-century Enlightenment ''[[philosophes]]''. 21st century Humanism tends to strongly endorse [[human rights]], including [[reproductive rights]], [[gender equality]], [[social justice]], and the [[separation of church and state]].

===Hedonism===
{{Main|Hedonism}}
Philosophical hedonism is a meta-ethical theory of value which argues that [[pleasure]] is the only [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic good]] and pain is the only intrinsic bad.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2013/entries/hedonism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Andrew|last=Moore|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea behind hedonistic thought is that pleasure (an umbrella term for all inherently likable emotions) is the only thing that is good in and of itself or by its very nature.  This implies evaluating the moral worth of character or behavior according to the extent that the pleasure it produces exceeds the pain it entails.  &lt;!-- This last sentence was:  "The normative implications of this are evaluating character or behavior as morally good to the extent that one is concerned with pleasure/pain qua pleasure/pain or an action leads to a greater balance of pleasure over pain than any other would." --&gt;

===Libertinism===
{{Main|Libertine}}
A libertine is one devoid of most moral restraints, which are seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behaviour sanctified by the larger society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/libertine|title=libertine|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=libertine|title=WordNet Search - 3.1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertines place value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in [[France]] and [[Great Britain]]. Notable among these were [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]], and the [[Marquis de Sade]]. During the [[Baroque era]] in France, there existed a [[Freethought|freethinking]] circle of philosophers and intellectuals who were collectively known as ''libertinage érudit'' and which included [[Gabriel Naudé]], [[Élie Diodati]] and [[François de La Mothe Le Vayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=René Pintard|title=Le Libertinage érudit dans la première moitié du XVIIe siècle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IeL29wMqdbgC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=24 July 2012|year=2000|publisher=Slatkine|isbn=978-2-05-101818-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/fideism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Richard|last=Amesbury|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Vivian de Sola Pinto]] linked [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]]'s libertinism to [[Hobbesian]] [[materialism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/specials/greene-monkey.html A Martyr to Sin]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectivism===
{{Libertarianism sidebar |Concepts}}
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] is a system of philosophy created by philosopher and novelist [[Ayn Rand]] (1905–1982) that holds: [[reality]] exists independent of consciousness; human beings gain knowledge rationally from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive and deductive logic; the moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness or rational self-interest. Rand thinks the only social system consistent with this morality is full respect for individual rights, embodied in pure ''[[laissez faire]]'' [[capitalism]]; and the role of [[art]] in human life is to transform man's widest metaphysical ideas, by selective reproduction of reality, into a physical form—a work of art—that he can comprehend and to which he can respond emotionally. Objectivism celebrates man as his own hero, "with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute."&lt;ref&gt;"About the Author" in {{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical anarchism===
{{Main|Philosophical anarchism}}
[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|upright=0.8|left|thumb|[[Benjamin Tucker]], American individualist anarchist who focused on economics calling them "Anarchistic-Socialism"&lt;ref&gt;Tucker said, ''"the fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon the sale of their labour, while another class of men are relieved of the necessity of labour by being legally privileged to sell something that is not labour. . . . And to such a state of things I am as much opposed as any one. But the minute you remove privilege. . . every man will be a labourer exchanging with fellow-labourers . . . What Anarchistic-Socialism aims to abolish is usury . . . it wants to deprive capital of its reward."''Benjamin Tucker. ''Instead of a Book'', p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; and adhering to the [[Mutualism (economy)|mutualist]] economics of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Josiah Warren]]]]
Philosophical anarchism is an [[anarchist school of thought]]&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Gabardi, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1957102 review] of ''Anarchism'' by David Miller, published in ''American Political Science Review'' Vol. 80, No. 1. (Mar., 1986), pp. 300—02.&lt;/ref&gt; which contends that the [[Sovereign state|State]] lacks [[legitimacy (political)|moral legitimacy]] and – in contrast to revolutionary anarchism – does not advocate violent revolution to eliminate it but advocates peaceful evolution to superate it.&lt;ref&gt;According to scholar [[Allan Antliff]], Benjamin Tucker coined the term "philosophical anarchism," to distinguish peaceful evolutionary anarchism from revolutionary variants. ''Antliff, Allan. 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dQTk-N4JWbYC Anarchist Modernism: Art, Politics, and the First American Avant-Garde]. University of Chicago Press. p. 4''&lt;/ref&gt; Though philosophical anarchism does not necessarily imply any action or desire for the elimination of the State, philosophical anarchists do not believe that they have an obligation or duty to obey the State, or conversely, that the State has a right to command.

Philosophical anarchism is a component especially of individualist anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12). Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical anarchists of historical note include [[Mohandas Gandhi]], William Godwin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Max Stirner,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freeden identifies four broad types of individualist anarchism. He says the first is the type associated with William Godwin that advocates [[self-government]] with a "progressive rationalism that included benevolence to others." The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[Egotism|Egoism]], as most associated with Max Stirner. The third type is "found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe|Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution." The fourth type retains a moderated form of Egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market. ''Freeden, Michael.

Thoreau's Proposals for Legislation. American Quarterly, Vol. 7, No. 3 (Autumn, 1955). p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary philosophical anarchists include A. John Simmons and [[Robert Paul Wolff]].

===Subjectivism===
{{Main|Subjectivism}}
Subjectivism is a philosophical tenet that accords primacy to subjective experience as fundamental of all measure and law. In extreme forms like [[Solipsism]], it may hold that the nature and existence of every object depends solely on someone's subjective awareness of it. For example, [[Wittgenstein]] wrote in [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]: "The subject doesn't belong to the world, but it is a limit of the world" (proposition 5.632). Metaphysical subjectivism is the theory that reality is what we perceive to be real, and that there is no underlying true reality that exists independently of perception. One can also hold that it is [[consciousness]] rather than perception that is reality ([[subjective idealism]]). In [[probability]], a subjectivism stands for the belief that probabilities are simply degrees-of-belief by rational agents in a certain proposition, and which have no objective reality in and of themselves.

[[Ethical subjectivism]] stands in opposition to [[moral realism]], which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of human opinion; to [[error theory]], which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense; and to [[non-cognitivism]], which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all. The most common forms of ethical subjectivism are also forms of [[moral relativism]], with moral standards held to be relative to each culture or society (c.f. [[cultural relativism]]), or even to every individual. The latter view, as put forward by [[Protagoras]], holds that there are as many distinct scales of good and evil as there are subjects in the world. Moral subjectivism is that species of moral relativism that relativizes moral value to the individual subject.

[[Horst Matthai Quelle]]  was a [[Spanish language]] [[Germany|German]] anarchist [[philosophy|philosopher]] influenced by [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E6JFPiDRlikC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;lpg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q=horst%20matthai%20el%20humanismo%20como%20problema%20humano Horst Matthai Quelle. ''Textos Filosóficos (1989-1999)''. p. 15]&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that since the individual gives form to the world, he is those objects, the others and the whole universe.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"/&gt; One of his main views was a "theory of infinite worlds" which for him was developed by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-socratic philosophers]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"/&gt;

====Solipsism====
{{Main|Solipsism}}
Solipsism is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] idea that only one's own [[mind]] is sure to exist. The term comes from [[Latin]] ''solus'' (alone) and ''ipse'' (self). Solipsism as an [[epistemology|epistemological]] position holds that [[knowledge]] of anything outside one's own mind is unsure. [[Philosophical skepticism|The external world]] and [[problem of other minds|other minds]] cannot be known, and might not exist outside the mind. As a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] position, solipsism goes further to the conclusion that the world and other minds do not exist. As such it is the only epistemological position that, by its own [[wikt:postulate#Pronunciation|postulate]], is both [[wikt:irrefutable#English|irrefutable]] and yet indefensible in the same manner. Although the number of individuals sincerely espousing solipsism has been small, it is not uncommon for one philosopher to accuse another's arguments of entailing solipsism as an unwanted consequence, in a kind of [[reductio ad absurdum]]. In the history of philosophy, solipsism has served as a [[skeptical hypothesis]].

==Economic individualism==
The [[doctrine]] of economic individualism holds that each individual should be allowed [[autonomy]] in making his or her own economic decisions as opposed to those decisions being made by the state, the [[community]], the corporation etc. for him or her.

===Liberalism===
{{Main|Liberalism}}
Classical liberalism is a political ideology that developed in the 19th century in [[England]], [[Western Europe]], and the [[Americas]]. It followed earlier forms of liberalism in its commitment to personal freedom and popular government, but differed from earlier forms of liberalism in its commitment to [[free markets]] and [[classical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=sq-1z8VMhDEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage|title=Modern Political Philosophy|first=Richard|last=Hudelson|date=1 January 1999|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable classical liberals in the 19th century include [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[Thomas Malthus]], and [[David Ricardo]]. Classical liberalism was revived in the 20th century by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], and further developed by [[Milton Friedman]], [[Robert Nozick]], [[Loren Lomasky]], and [[Jan Narveson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Conway (academic)|David Conway]]. ''Classical Liberalism: The Unvanquished Ideal.'' Palgrave Macmillan. 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-312-21932-1}} p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''classical liberalism'' is also sometimes used to refer to all forms of liberalism before the 20th century.

===Individualist anarchism and economics===
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|Influential [[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Emile Armand]]]]
In regards to economic questions within individualist anarchism there are adherents to [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] ([[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], [[Emile Armand]], early Benjamin Tucker); [[natural rights]] positions (early Benjamin Tucker, [[Lysander Spooner]], Josiah Warren); and egoistic disrespect for "ghosts" such as private property and markets (Max Stirner, [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Lev Chernyi]], later Benjamin Tucker, [[Renzo Novatore]], [[illegalism]]). Contemporary individualist anarchist [[Kevin Carson]] characterizes American individualist anarchism saying that "Unlike the rest of the [[socialist]] movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the natural wage of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of the state in their interests. Thus, individualist anarchism was an alternative both to the increasing statism of the mainstream socialist movement, and to a [[classical liberal]] movement that was moving toward a mere apologetic for the power of big business." &lt;ref&gt;Kevin Carson. ''Organization Theory: A Libertarian Perspective''. BOOKSURGE. 2008. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mutualism====
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David. 1987. "Mutualism." The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism is based on a [[labor theory of value]] which holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility".&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving anything less would be considered exploitation, theft of labor, or [[usury]].

Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx."

Pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In some ways, it is perhaps fair to say that if Left communism is an intellectual- political formation, it is so, first and foremost, negatively – as opposed to other socialist traditions. I have labelled this negative pole 'socialist orthodoxy', composed of both Leninists and social democrats...What I suggested was that these Left communist thinkers differentiated their own understandings of communism from a strand of socialism that came to follow a largely electoral road in the West, pursuing a kind of social capitalism, and a path to socialism that predominated in the peripheral and semi- peripheral countries, which sought revolutionary conquest of power and led to something like state capitalism. Generally, the Left communist thinkers were to find these paths locked within the horizons of capitalism (the law of value, money, private property, class, the state), and they were to characterize these solutions as statist, substitutionist and authoritarian."

===Right-libertarianism===
{{Objectivist movement}}
{{Main|Right-libertarianism}}
Right-libertarianism or right libertarianism is a phrase used by some to describe either non-[[collectivist]] forms of libertarianism&lt;ref&gt;Serena Olsaretti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NZmGrPKu8BMC Liberty, Desert and the Market: A Philosophical Study], Cambridge University Press, 2004, 14, 88, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; or a variety of different libertarian views some label "right" of mainstream libertarianism including "[[libertarian conservatism]]".

Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy calls it "right libertarianism" but states: "Libertarianism is often thought of as 'right-wing' doctrine. This, however, is mistaken for at least two reasons. First, on social—rather than economic—issues, libertarianism tends to be 'left-wing'. It opposes laws that restrict consensual and private sexual relationships between adults (e.g., gay sex, non-marital sex, and deviant sex), laws that restrict drug use, laws that impose religious views or practices on individuals, and compulsory military service. Second, in addition to the better-known version of libertarianism—right-libertarianism—there is also a version known as '[[left-libertarianism]]'. Both endorse full self-ownership, but they differ with respect to the powers agents have to appropriate unappropriated natural resources (land, air, water, etc.)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] entry on [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism Libertarianism], [[Stanford University]], July 24, 2006 version.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As creative independent lifestyle==
[[File:Oscar Wilde portrait.jpg|upright=0.7|left|thumb|[[Oscar Wilde]], famous [[Irish people|Irish]] [[socialist]] writer of the [[decadent movement]] and famous [[dandy]]]]
The anarchist&lt;ref&gt;"The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde ''The Soul of Man under Socialism''. Wilde, as we have seen, declared himself an anarchist on at least one occasion during the 1890s, and he greatly admired [[Peter Kropotkin]], whom he had met. Later, in ''De Profundis'', he described Kropotkin's life as one "of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience" and talked of him as "a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia." But in ''The Soul of Man under Socialism'', which appeared in 1890, it is Godwin rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant." George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962. (p. 447)&lt;/ref&gt; writer and [[bohemianism|bohemian]] [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote in his famous essay ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' that "Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine."&lt;ref name="flag.blackened.net"/&gt; For anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] "Wilde's aim in ''The Soul of Man under Socialism'' is to seek the society most favorable to the artist...for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated...Wilde represents the anarchist as [[aesthete]]."&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962. p. 447"/&gt; The word individualism in this way has been used to denote a personality with a strong tendency towards self-creation and experimentation as opposed to tradition or popular mass opinions and behaviors.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bohemia: The Underworld of Art"/&gt;

Anarchist writer [[Murray Bookchin]] describes a lot of individualist anarchists as people who "expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior, and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de siècle New York, Paris, and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a bohemian lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom ('[[free love]]') and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing."&lt;ref name="bohemian individualism"/&gt;

In relation to this view of individuality, French Individualist anarchist [[Emile Armand]] advocates [[ethical egoism|egoistical]] denial of social conventions and dogmas to live in accord to one's own ways and desires in daily life since he emphasized anarchism as a way of life and practice. In this way he opines "So the anarchist individualist tends to reproduce himself, to perpetuate his spirit in other individuals who will share his views and who will make it possible for a state of affairs to be established from which authoritarianism has been banished. It is this desire, this will, not only to live, but also to reproduce oneself, which we shall call "activity".&lt;ref name="lifeactivity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/library/emile-armand/life-activity.html|title=Emil Armand "Anarchist Individualism as a Life and Activity"|first=|last=_wlo:dek|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Imperfect garden : the legacy of humanism'', humanist philosopher [[Tzvetan Todorov]] identifies individualism as an important current of socio-political thought within modernity and as examples of it he mentions [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|François de La Rochefoucauld]], [[Marquis de Sade]], and [[Charles Baudelaire]].&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"&gt;''Imperfect garden : the legacy of humanism''. Princeton University Press. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In La Rochefoucauld, he identifies a tendency similar to [[stoicism]] in which "the honest person works his being in the manner of a sculptor who searches the liberation of the forms which are inside a block of marble, to extract the truth of that matter."&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"/&gt; In Baudelaire he finds the [[dandy]] trait in which one searches to cultivate "the idea of beauty within oneself, of satisfying one's passions of feeling and thinking."&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"/&gt;

The [[Russian American|Russian-American]] poet [[Joseph Brodsky]] once wrote that "The surest defense against Evil is extreme individualism, originality of thinking, whimsicality, even—if you will—eccentricity. That is, something that can't be feigned, faked, imitated; something even a seasoned imposter couldn't be happy with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quotes.dictionary.com/The_surest_defense_against_Evil_is_extreme_individualism |title=Dictionary.com - The world's favorite online dictionary! |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119120030/http://quotes.dictionary.com/The_surest_defense_against_Evil_is_extreme_individualism |archivedate=2010-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] famously declared, "Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist"—a point of view developed at length in both the life and work of [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Equally memorable and influential on [[Walt Whitman]] is Emerson's idea that "a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines." Emerson opposes on principle the reliance on civil and religious social structures precisely because through them the individual approaches the divine second-hand, mediated by the once original experience of a genius from another age. "An institution," he explains, "is the lengthened shadow of one man." To achieve this original relation one must "Insist on one's self; never imitate" for if the relationship is secondary the connection is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/emerson/#H2|title=Emerson, Ralph Waldo - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The International Panel of Parliamentarians for Freedom of Religion or Belief (IPPFoRB)''' is a network of parliamentarians from around the world committed to combating religious persecution and advancing freedom of religion or belief, as defined by Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ippforb.com|title=The IPPFoRB's website|last=|first=|date=|website=ippforb.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
IPPFoRB was established on 8 November 2014 with the signing of the Oslo Charter for Freedom of Religion or Belief at the [[Nobel Peace Center]] in [[Oslo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldreligionnews.com/issues/30-parliamentarians-meet-oslo-sign-freedom-religion-charter|title=30 Parliamentarians Meet with USCIRF in Oslo to Sign a Freedom of Religion Charter|last=|first=|date=2014-11-13|work=World Religion News|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first steering committee of the IPPFoRB was composed of Baroness [[Elizabeth Berridge, Baroness Berridge|Elizabeth Berridge]] (UK [[House of Lords]]), [[David Anderson (Saskatchewan politician)|David Anderson]] ([[House of Commons of Canada]]), [[Abid Raja]] ([[Parliament of Norway]]), [[Aykan Erdemir]] ([[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]]), Leonardo Quintao ([[National Congress of Brazil]]).

== Activities ==

In September 2015, IPPFoRB convened&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2015/09/religious-freedom-network-should-be-as-outspoken-and-organized-as-the-extremists/|title=Religious freedom network should be as 'outspoken and organized' as the extremists|last=|first=|date=2015-09-22|work=World Watch Monitor|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 100 parliamentarians from 50 countries in [[New York City|New York]], alongside the [[United Nations General Assembly]], and issued the New York Resolution for Freedom of Religion or Belief to "enhance global cooperation by working across geographical, political, and religious lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ippforb.com/new-york-resolution/|title=New York Resolution for Freedom of Religion or Belief|last=|first=|date=|website=IPPFoRB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the New York meeting, IPPFoRB founder Aykan Erdemir stated that this global network is "idea for which the time is right," adding that people advocating rights should be as "outspoken, organised and transnational" as the violent extremists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2015/09/religious-freedom-network-should-be-as-outspoken-and-organized-as-the-extremists/|title=Religious freedom network should be as 'outspoken and organised' as the extremists|last=|first=|date=September 22, 2015|work=World Watch Monitor|access-date=December 15, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, IPPFoRB assembled 100 parliamentarians from 60 countries in [[Berlin]] with the attendance of German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2016/09/freedom-of-religion-or-belief-the-defining-issue-of-our-time/|title=Freedom of religion or belief 'the defining issue of our time'|last=|first=|date=|work=World Watch Monitor|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, IPPFoRB parliamentarians have written advocacy letters to heads of state of Burma, Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Sudan, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/religious-rights/305900-legislators-abroad-unite-for-religious-freedom|title=Legislators abroad unite for religious freedom|last=|first=|date=2016-11-14|work=The Hill|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intrinsic finality''' is the idea that there is a natural good for all beings, and that all beings have a natural tendency to pursue their own good.  It is an underlying principle of both [[teleology]] and [[moral universalism|moral objectivism.]] The concept of intrinsic finality was summarized by [[Thomas Aquinas]]&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ([[Summa contra Gentiles|''Contra Gentiles'']] IV, xix)&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

:''By the form which gives it its specific perfection, everything in nature has an inclination to its own operations and to its own end, which it reaches through these operations. Just as everything is, such also are its operations and its tendency to what is suitable to itself.''

The idea of intrinsic finality presumes an [[objective reality]] that obeys a natural order or [[natural law]] in the universe.  Things are "meant" to be and behave a certain way, and naturally tend to act that way.  For instance, animals have natural instincts for self-preservation, seeking food, and reproduction.  They do so because it is their ''nature'' to do so.  Theologians go further, to argue that they do so because they were ''created'' to do so.

The existence of such a finality is often challenged, particularly by philosophers ascribing to [[philosophical naturalism]].  They argue that it is unreasonable to say that all beings naturally pursue their own benefit, when some beings clearly do not.  They point to instances of [[perfection|imperfection]], [[disease]], and [[death]] as evidence that natural beings do not naturally move toward perfection. But proponents of intrinsic finalilty respond that the very recognition of such imperfection requires an ideal or standard of the perfect end from which the being in question falls short owing to a variety of factors including improper [[education]], [[sin]], or [[predestination]].

Intrinsic finality provides the basis for the [[teleological argument]] for the existence of God and its modern counterpart, [[intelligent design]]. Proponents of teleology argue that Darwinism does not resolve a fundamental defect in philosophical naturalism; that it focuses exclusively on the immediate causes and mechanisms of events and does not attend to the reason for their synthesis. For example, if we take a clock apart, we discover in it nothing but springs, wheels, pivots, levers and so on but does our having explained the mechanism which causes the revolutions of the hands on the dial make it reasonable to say that the clock was not made to keep time?

Naturalists respond that biology has been profoundly concerned with the ways function constrains structure since the time of Aristotle and that Darwin's own awareness of teleology is evident in his study  in functional constraints on the evolutionary development of the beaks of Galapagos finches, of which he wrote, "Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends." (''[[Origin of Species]]'', chapter 19)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2940">The '''''Ker''-''Frisbie'' doctrine''' is applied in the context of [[extradition]] and generally holds that criminal defendants may be prosecuted in [[United States]] courts regardless of whether their presence has been obtained through the use of applicable extradition treaties.

== History ==
In ''[[Ker v. Illinois]]'', {{ussc|119|436|1886}}, a messenger forcibly kidnapped the defendant from [[Peru]] and brought him back to the United States, even though he had been sent to Peru with a valid [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] and instructions to obtain the defendant with the cooperation of the local authorities. Addressing Ker's [[due process]] challenge, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that "such forcible abduction is no sufficient reason why the party should not answer when brought within the jurisdiction of the court which has the right to try him for such an offence, and presents no valid objection to his trial in such court".

''[[Frisbie v. Collins]]'', {{ussc|342|519|1952}}, presented a case in which the defendant was tried in [[Michigan]] after being abducted by Michigan authorities in [[Chicago]]. Applying its decision in ''Ker'', the Supreme Court upheld the conviction over challenges based on [[due process]] and federal [[kidnapping]] laws. 

More recently, the Supreme Court relied on the Ker–Frisbie doctrine in ''[[United States v. Alvarez-Machain]]'', {{ussc|504|655|1992}}. Álvarez Machaín, a [[Mexico|Mexican]] citizen, was abducted and brought to the United States at the direction of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]. The Court rejected the argument that such abductions undermine the usefulness of extradition treaties, and it refused to read general principles of [[international law]] weighing against such abductions into the Mexican extradition treaty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4526">'''Kyrkoplikt''' (literary: 'Church duty') was a historical form of punishment, practiced in [[Sweden-Finland]]. It was a form of [[Public humiliation]] in which the condemned was made to confess and repent their crime before being rehabilitated and spared further punishments. It could be sentenced by the church or by a secular court, and performed by the church.

==History==
The ''Kyrkoplikt'' originated from the [[Confession]] and repentance within the Catholic church during the [[middle ages]]: after having committed a graver crime, the criminal was cast out of their parish congregation, and was only rehabilitated after having repented their sin.

In the [[Swedish Church Ordinance 1571]], the ''Kyrkoplikt'' consisted of the corporal punishments meted out within the sphere of [[Public humiliation]], such as [[pillory]]ing, the [[Stocks]], [[Corporal Punishment]] and similar punishments, or fines. Finally, the condemned were made to stand upon the ''Pliktpallen'' (Duty Stool) also called ''Skampallen'' (Shame Stool) during church sermon, when their crime were described, after which they repented and were rehabilitated. The punishment could be meted out by both the church as well as by a secular court, who both had the right to handle criminals.

By the [[Swedish Church Law 1686]], the church was no longer allowed to handle court cases and judge criminals and the right to sentence criminals to 
''Kyrkoplikt'' was reserved for the legal courts of the state.

In 1741, a legal reform created two forms of ''Kyrkoplikt'': ''[[Uppenbar kyrkoplikt]]'' and ''[[Enskild kyrkoplikt]]''.

On 4 May 1855, ''Kyrkoplikt'' and all forms of [[Public humiliation]] was abolished in Sweden. In Finland, the same reform was introduced in 1864.

==Uppenbar kyrkoplikt==
The ''Uppenbar kyrkoplikt'' (literary: 'Obvious Church Duty') was the original form of ''kyrkoplikt''. As stated above, it consisted of the condemned being exposed on the ''Pliktpallen'' (Duty Stool) also called ''Skampallen'' (Shame Stool) during church sermon, when their crime were described, after which they repented and were rehabilitated, in many cases after having been subjected to other form of punishments before.

''Uppenbar kyrkoplikt'' was meted out for all forms of criminalized acts: theft, adultery, abuse, witchcraft and those pardoned from the death sentence.

By the reform of 1741, ''Uppenbar kyrkoplikt'' was abolished for sex outside of marriage. All sexual acts outside of marriage were formally illegal, but as an illegal sexual act was normally only exposed when it resulted in pregnancy, and the male party could deny having engaged in the act while the participation of the pregnant female in the act was undeniable, the ''Uppenbar kyrkoplikt'' was in practice mostly used upon unmarried mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlander, Ann-Sofie, Kärlek, död och frihet: historiska uppsatser om människovärde och livsvillkor i Sverige, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  This was viewed as a problem in the [[Riksdag of the Estates]], because the social stigma caused by the ''Uppenbar kyrkoplikt'' way of exposing the women, who felt themselves socially branded, was found to be a significant cause of [[infanticide]] performed by unmarried women desperate to do anything to avoid having their reputation ruined by the shame, and despite opposition from the clergy, ''Uppenbar kyrkoplikt'' was abolished for sexual crimes in an attempt to prevent infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlander, Ann-Sofie, Kärlek, död och frihet: historiska uppsatser om människovärde och livsvillkor i Sverige, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; This reform was followed by the ''[[Barnamordsplakatet]]'' in 1778.

==Enskild kyrkoplikt==
The ''Enskild kyrkoplikt'' (literary: 'Private Church Duty') meant that the criminal was made to confess and repent in the [[Sacristy]], before or after service, in private before the priest and only a handful of witnesses selected by the priest.

This was used for the crime of sex outside of marriage, as well as smaller crimes such as insignificant forms of theft.

'''Malaysia's Post General Election rally 2013''' or '''Himpunan Black Out 2013''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]) was a series of rallies held throughout Malaysia after the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 general election]] to express discontent with the election result. The first rally was in [[Kelana Jaya]], [[Malaysia]] on 8 May 2013. The rally was held by various Malaysian opposition-friendly non-governmental organisations and opposition parties claiming that there had been irregularities in the polling. The main venue chosen for the rally was Kelana Jaya Stadium. Web sites and blogs favourable to the opposition claimed that the rally was attended by 120,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Live Report. [http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/229564 "120,000 show of force at post-GE13 rally"], ''[[Malaysiakini]]'', Kelana Jaya, 8 May 2013. Retrieved 9 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that the stadium's normal capacity is about 25,000, other sources estimated the number of people in and around it to be between 64,000 and 69,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/thousands-pack-kelana-jaya-stadium-for-pakatan-rally |title=Thousands pack Kelana Jaya stadium for Pakatan rally |last1=Lyn |first1=Boo Su |last2=Ding |first2=Emily |date=9 May 2013 |website=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |access-date=10 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919012500/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/thousands-pack-kelana-jaya-stadium-for-pakatan-rally/ |archivedate=19 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusing the Election Commission of fraudulent conduct==
The rally was initiated by [[Anwar Ibrahim]], who claimed that the election was fraudulent. The opposition won 3 states ([[Selangor]], [[Kelantan]] and [[Penang]]), but [[Barisan Nasional]] won the elections despite losing the popular vote, thereby gaining the mandate to lead [[Malaysia]] for another 5 years. In the rally [[Anwar Ibrahim]] urged opposition supporters to wear black as a sign of protest.&lt;ref&gt;Razak Ahmad and Florence A. Samy.

Retrieved 9 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues raised==
[[Anwar Ibrahim]] and other [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) leaders present at the rally raised issues such as phantom voters, blackouts and the usage of indelible ink by the Malaysian Election Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/najib-denies-bn-link-to-phantom-voter-claims |title=Najib denies BN link to phantom voter claims |last1=Chooi |first1=Clara |date=5 May 2013 |website=The Malaysian Insider |access-date=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification |date=October 2015 |reason=source predates the rally, therefore does not describe discussion of these issues at the rally}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2304">As defined by the [[Austrian School|Austrian School of economics]] the '''marginal use''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.&lt;ref name="weiser_ein"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  The useful''ness'' of the marginal use thus corresponds to the [[marginal utility]] of the good or service.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch"&gt;Mc Culloch, James Huston; [http://www.mises.org/etexts/mcCulloch.pdf “The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use and of Ordinal Marginal Utility”,] ''[[Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie]]'' 37 (1977) #3&amp;amp;4 (September).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the assumption that an agent is [[Rational choice theory|economically rational]], each increase would be put to the specific, feasible, previously unrealized use of greatest priority, and each decrease would result in abandonment of the use of lowest priority amongst the uses to which the good or service had been put.&lt;ref name="weiser_ein" /&gt;  And, in the absence of a complementarity across uses, [[Law of diminishing marginal utility|the “law” of diminishing marginal utility]] will obtain.&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"&gt;[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen, Nicholas]]; “Utility”, ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

The Austrian School of economics explicitly arrives at its conception of marginal utility as the utility of the marginal use, and “Grenznutzen” (the Austrian School term from which “marginal utility” was originally derived in translation&lt;ref&gt;Streissler, E., “Wieser, Friedrich, Freiherr von”, [[The New Palgrave:  A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 4  (1987), p. 921.&lt;/ref&gt;) literally means ''border-use''; other schools usually do not make an explicit connection.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

In [[behavioral geography]], a '''mental map''' is a person's [[Perspective (cognitive)|point-of-view]] perception of their area of interaction. Although this kind of subject matter would seem most likely to be studied by fields in the [[social sciences]], this particular subject is most often studied by modern day [[geographers]]. They study it to determine [[Subjectivity|subjective]] qualities from the public such as personal preference and practical uses of geography like driving directions. [[Mass media]] also have a virtually direct effect on a person's mental map of the geographical world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mentalmaps.info Mental Maps Resource Site]&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived geographical dimensions of a foreign nation (relative to one's own nation) may often be heavily influenced by the amount of time and relative news coverage that the news media may spend covering news events from that foreign region. For instance, a person might perceive a small island to be nearly the size of a continent, merely based on the amount of news coverage that he or she is exposed to on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geography.about.com/cs/culturalgeography/a/mentalmaps.htm Mental Maps on About.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Experimental psychology|psychology]], the term names the information maintained in the mind of an organism by means of which it may plan activities, select routes over previously traveled territories, etc. The rapid traversal of a familiar [[maze]] depends on this kind of mental map if scents or other markers laid down by the subject are eliminated before the maze is re-run.

==Background==
Mental maps are an outcome of the field of behavioral geography. The imagined maps are considered one of the first studies that intersected geographical settings with human action.&lt;ref name="Gregory"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=Derek|title=Dictionary of Human Geography: Mental maps/Cognitive Maps|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Hoboken|edition=5th |author2=Johnston, Rom |author3=Pratt, Geraldine |page=455}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most prominent contribution and study of mental maps was in the writings of [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]]. In ''[[The Image of the City]]'', Lynch used simple sketches of maps created from memory of an urban area to reveal five elements of the city; nodes, edges, districts, paths and landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynch|first=Kevin|title=The Image of the City|year=1960|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lynch claimed that “Most often our perception of the city is not sustained, but rather partial, fragmentary, mixed with other concerns. Nearly every sense is in operation, and the image is the composite of them all.” (Lynch, 1960, p 2.) The creation of a mental map relies on memory as opposed to being copied from a preexisting map or image. In ''The Image of the City'', Lynch asks a participant to create a map as follows: “Make it just as if you were making a rapid description of the city to a stranger, covering all the main features. We don’t expect an accurate drawing- just a rough sketch.” (Lynch 1960, p 141) In the field of human geography mental maps have led to an emphasizing of social factors and the use of social methods versus quantitative or positivist methods.&lt;ref name="Gregory" /&gt; Mental maps have often led to revelations regarding social conditions of a particular space or area. Haken and Portugali (2003) developed an information view, which 
argued that the face of the city is its information &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haken|first=Herman|author2=Portugali, Juval|title=The face of the city is its information|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|date=August 2003|volume=23|pages=385–408|doi=10.1016/s0272-4944(03)00003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. Bin Jiang (2012) argued that the image of the city (or mental map) arises out of the scaling of city artifacts and locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Bin|title=The image of the city out of the underlying scaling of city artifacts or locations|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|year=2012|volume=103|pages= 1552–1566| doi = 10.1080/00045608.2013.779503 |arxiv=1209.1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed that why the image of city can be formed 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Bin|title=Why can the image of the city be formed| arxiv=1212.3703|bibcode=2012arXiv1212.3703J}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, and he even suggested ways of computing the image of the city, or more precisely the kind of collective image of the city, using increasingly available geographic information such as Flickr and Twitter
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Bin|title=Computing the image of the city| arxiv=1212.0940|bibcode=2012arXiv1212.0940J}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.

==Research applications==
Mental maps have been used in a collection of spatial research. Many studies have been performed that focus on the quality of an environment in terms of feelings such as fear, desire and stress. A study by Matei et al. in 2001 used mental maps to reveal the role of media in shaping urban space in Los Angeles. The study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to process 215 mental maps taken from seven neighborhoods across the city. The results showed that people’s fear perceptions in Los Angeles are not associated with high crime rates but are instead associated with a concentration of certain ethnicities in a given area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matei|first=Sorin |author2=Ball-Rokeach, Sandra |author3=Qiu Linchuan, Jack|title=Fear and Misperception of Los Angeles Urban Space: A Spatial-Statistical Study of Communication-Shaped Mental Maps|journal=Communication Research|date=August 2001|volume=28|issue=4|pages=429–463|accessdate=4 November 2012|url=http://mentalmap.org/files/matei_fear_CR.pdf|doi=10.1177/009365001028004004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mental maps recorded in the study draw attention to these areas of concentrated ethnicities as parts of the urban space to avoid or stay away from. 
	
Mental maps have also been used to describe the urban experience of children. In a 2008 study by Olga den Besten mental maps were used to map out the fears and dislikes of children in Berlin and Paris. The study looked into the absence of children in today’s cities and the urban environment from a child’s perspective of safety, stress and fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Den Besten|first=Olga den|title=Local belonging and ‘geographies of emotions’: Immigrant children’s experience of their neighbourhoods in Paris and Berlin|journal=Childhood|date=May 2010|volume=17|issue=2|pages=181–195|url=http://chd.sagepub.com/content/17/2/181|accessdate=4 November 2012|doi=10.1177/0907568210365649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Gould and Rodney White have performed prominent analyses in the book “Mental Maps.” This book is an investigation into people’s spatial desires. The book asks of its participants: “Suppose you were suddenly given the chance to choose where you would like to live- an entirely free choice that you could make quite independently of the usual constraints of income or job availability. Where would you choose to go?” (Gould, 1974, p 15) Gould and White use their findings to create a surface of desire for various areas of the world. The surface of desire is meant to show people’s environmental preferences and regional biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gould|first=Peter|title=Mental Maps|year=1993|publisher=Rutledge|location=New York|author2=White, Rodney|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an experiment done by [[Edward C. Tolman]], the development of a mental map was seen in rats.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, B. (2011). ''Cognitive Psychology: Connecting Mind, Research, and Everyday Experience--with coglab manual. (3rd ed.).'' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; A rat was placed in a cross shaped maze and allowed to explore it. After this initial exploration, the rat was placed at one arm of the cross and food was placed at the next arm to the immediate right. The rat was conditioned to this layout and learned to turn right at the intersection in order to get to the food. When placed at different arms of the cross maze however, the rat still went in the correct direction to obtain the food because of the initial mental map it had created of the maze. Rather than just deciding to turn right at the intersection no matter what, the rat was able to determine the correct way to the food no matter where in the maze it was placed.

The idea of mental maps is also used in strategic analysis. David Brewster, an Australian strategic analyst, has applied the concept to strategic conceptions of South Asia and Southeast Asia.  He argues that popular mental maps of where regions begin and end can have a significant impact on the strategic behaviour of states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Brewster|url=https:// www.academia.edu/7697999/Dividing_Lines_Evolving_Mental_Maps_of_the_Bay_of_Bengal|title=Dividing Lines: Evolving Mental Maps of the Bay of Bengal. Retrieved 21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A collection of essays, documenting current geographical and historical research in mental maps is published by the Journal of Cultural Geography in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Götz, [https://doi.org/10.1080/08873631.2018.1426953 Norbert and Janne Holmén. “Introduction to the Theme Issue: ‘Mental Maps: Geographical and Historical Perspectives’.” Journal of Cultural Geography 25 (2018) 2: 157–161.

=== Yield burning scandal ===
{{See also|Yield burning}}

In 1994, Lissack exposed a major yield burning scandal on [[Wall Street]].&lt;ref name="accuser"/&gt;  The issue was eventually settled by a number of firms for over $200 million,&lt;ref name=update&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E6DC123CF937A25757C0A9649C8B63 UPDATE/MICHAEL R. LISSACK; Wall Street Expatriate], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 14th, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; to which Lissack was entitled to at least 15% per federal whistleblower laws. Lissack used some of these funds for charitable purposes including endowing a professorship in social responsibility and personal ethics at his alma mater, [[Williams College]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.iberkshires.com/story/35532/Four-Professors-at-Williams-College-Receive-Named-Chairs.html | title=Four Professors at Williams College Receive Named Chairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1998, Lissack entered into a voluntary agreement with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] whereby he was banned from the securities industry for five years and paid a $30,000 fine,&lt;ref name=SEC&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/34-39687.htm | title=Michael Lissack: Admin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9133">In mathematics, '''Moufang polygons'''  are a generalization by [[Jacques Tits]] of the [[Moufang plane]]s studied by [[Ruth Moufang]], and are irreducible [[building (mathematics)|building]]s of rank two that admit the action of [[root group]]s.
In a book on the topic, Tits and Richard Weiss&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jacques |last1=Tits |authorlink1=Jacques Tits|first2=Richard |last2=Weiss |title=Moufang Polygons |location= |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2002 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; classify them all. An earlier theorem, proved independently by Tits and Weiss,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jacques |last1=Tits |authorlink1=Jacques Tits |title=Non-existence de certains, polygones généralisés, I, II |journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |year=1976 |pages=275–284 |doi=10.1007/BF01390013 }} '''51''' (3), (1979) 267–269 {{doi|10.1007/BF01389919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Weiss |title=The nonexistence of certain Moufang polygons |journal=Inventiones Mathematicae |volume=51 |issue=3 |year=1979 |pages=261–266 |doi=10.1007/BF01389918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a Moufang polygon must be a generalized 3-gon, 4-gon, 6-gon, or 8-gon, so the purpose of the aforementioned book was to analyze these four cases.

==Definitions==

*A generalized ''n''-gon is a bipartite graph of diameter ''n'' and girth 2''n''.
*A graph is called thick if all vertices have valence at least 3.
*A root of a generalized ''n''-gon is a path of length ''n''.
*An apartment of a generalized ''n''-gon is a cycle of length 2''n''.
*The root subgroup of a root is the subgroup of automorphisms of a graph that fix all vertices adjacent to one of the inner vertices of the root.
*A Moufang ''n''-gon is a thick generalized ''n''-gon (with ''n''&gt;2) such that the root subgroup of any root acts transitively on the apartments containing the root.

A Moufang 3-gon can be identified with the [[incidence graph]] of a Moufang [[projective plane]]. In this identification, the points and lines of the plane correspond to the vertices of the building.
Real forms of [[Lie groups]] give rise to examples which are the three main types of Moufang 3-gons. There are four real [[division algebras]]: the real numbers, the [[complex numbers]], the [[quaternions]], and the [[octonions]], of dimensions 1,2,4 and 8, respectively. The projective plane over such a division algebra then gives rise to a Moufang 3-gon.

These projective planes correspond to the building attached to SL&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), SL&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''C'''), a real form of A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and to a real form of E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

In the first diagram{{clarify|post-text=what diagram?|date=August 2012}} the circled nodes represent 1-spaces and 2-spaces in a three-dimensional vector space. In the second diagram{{clarify|post-text=what diagram?|date=August 2012}} the circled nodes represent 1-space and 2-spaces in a 3-dimensional vector space over the [[quaternions]], which in turn represent certain 2-spaces and 4-spaces in a 6-dimensional complex vector space, as expressed by the circled nodes in the A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; diagram. 
The fourth case — a form of E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; — is exceptional, and its analogue for Moufang 4-gons is a major feature of Weiss’s book.

Going from the real numbers to an arbitrary field, Moufang 3-gons can be divided into three cases as above. The split case in the first diagram exists over any field. The second case extends to all associative, non-commutative division algebras; over the reals these are limited to the algebra of quaternions, which has degree 2 (and dimension 4), but some fields admit central division algebras of other degrees. 
The third case involves ‘alternative’ division algebras (which satisfy a weakened form of the associative law), and a theorem of [[Richard Bruck]] and Erwin Kleinfeld&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard H. |last=Bruck |author1-link=Richard Bruck|first2=Erwin |last2=Kleinfeld |title=The structure of alternative division rings |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=2 |issue=6 |year=1951 |pages=878–890 |doi= 10.2307/2031702 |jstor=2031702|mr=0045099 |pmc=1063309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that these are Cayley-Dickson algebras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Erwin |last=Kleinfeld |title=Alternative division rings of characteristic 2 |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=37 |issue=12 |year=1951 |pages=818–820 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.37.12.818|pmc=1063478|mr=0041834 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concludes the discussion of Moufang 3-gons.

== Moufang 4-gons ==
Moufang 4-gons are also called Moufang quadrangles.
The classification of Moufang 4-gons was the hardest of all, and when Tits and Weiss started to write it up, a hitherto unnoticed type came into being, arising from groups of type F4. They can be divided into three classes:

*  (i) Those arising from classical groups.
* (ii) Those arising from “mixed groups” (in which there are two imperfect fields of characteristic 2, K and L, with K2 ⊂ L ⊂ K).
* (iii) Those arising from quadrangular algebras.

There is some overlap here, in the sense that some classical groups arising from pseudo-quadratic spaces can be obtained from quadrangular algebras (which Weiss calls special), but there are other, non-special ones. The most important of these arise from algebraic groups of types E6, E7, and E8. They are k-forms of algebraic groups belonging to the following diagrams:
E6
E7
E8. 
The E6 one exists over the real numbers, though the E7 and E8 ones do not. Weiss calls the quadrangular algebras in all these cases Weiss regular, but not special. 
There is a further type that he calls defective arising from groups of type F4. These are the most exotic of all—they involve purely inseparable field extensions in characteristic 2—and Weiss only discovered them during the joint work with Tits on the classification of Moufang 4-gons by investigating a strange lacuna that should not have existed but did.

The classification of Moufang 4-gons by Tits and Weiss is related to their intriguing monograph in two ways. One is that the use of quadrangular algebras short-cuts some of the methods known before. The other is that the concept is an analogue to the octonion algebras, and quadratic Jordan division algebras of degree 3, that give rise to Moufang 3-gons and 6-gons.

In fact all the exceptional Moufang planes, quadrangles, and hexagons that do not arise from "mixed groups" (of characteristic 2 for quadrangles or characteristic 3 for hexagons) come from octonions, quadrangular algebras, or Jordan algebras.

== Moufang 6-gons ==
Moufang 6-gons are also called Moufang hexagons. A classification of Moufang 6-gons was stated by Tits,&lt;ref&gt;J. Tits, Classification of buildings of spherical type and Moufang polygons: a survey, in
Coll. Internaz. Teorie Combinatorie, Atti dei Convegni Lincei 17, Rome 1976, pp. 229–246.&lt;/ref&gt; though the details remained unproven until the joint work with Weiss on Moufang Polygons.

== Moufang 8-gons ==
Moufang 8-gons are also called Moufang octagons. They were classified by Tits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Tits |title=Moufang octagons and Ree groups of type &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=[[American Journal of Mathematics|Amer. J. Math.]] |volume=105 |issue=2 |year=1983 |pages=539–594 |jstor=2374268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he showed that they all arise from [[Ree groups]] of type ²F₄.

==Quadrangular algebras==
A potential use for quadrangular algebras is to analyze two open questions. One is the Kneser-Tits conjecture&lt;ref&gt;J. Tits, Groupes de Whitehead de groupes algébriques simples sur un corps, Séminaire Bourbaki, 1976–77, no. 505; Lecture Notes in Mathematics 677, Springer-Verlag, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; that concerns the full group of '''linear transformations''' of a building (e.g. GL&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) factored out by the subgroup generated by root groups (e.g. SL&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

The conjecture is proved for all Moufang buildings except the 6-gons and 4-gons of type E8, in which case the group of linear transformations is conjectured to be equal to the subgroup generated by root groups. For the E8 hexagons this can be rephrased as a question on quadratic Jordan algebras, and for the E8 quadrangles it can now be rephrased in terms of quadrangular algebras.

Another open question about the E8 quadrangle concerns fields that are complete with respect to a discrete valuation: is there, in such cases, an affine building that yields the quadrangle as its structure at infinity?

The '''Multimedia Art Museum''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Мультимедиа Арт Музей}}), Moscow is a Russian state museum dedicated to the presentation and development of actual art related to new multimedia technologies. The museum was opened in October 2010 on the grounds of the [[Moscow House of Photography]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdf.ru/exhibitions/today/openewbuild_10/ Opening of Multimedia Art Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rg.ru/2010/10/12/muzey.html Поперек потока:В Москве открыл двери Мультимедиа Арт Музей], [[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]], 12 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
In 1996 the Moscow House of Photography was established. It was the first Russian state art institution focused on the art of photography. In 2001 it was transformed in the '''Multimedia Complex of Actual Arts'''. The Complex includes the ''[[Moscow House of Photography]]'' devoted to photography, ''The Alexander Rodchenko School of Photography and Multimedia'' opened in 2006 and named after Russian classic of photography [[Alexander Rodchenko]] and ''Multimedia Art Museum''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moscovery.com/multimedia-art-museum-moscow/|title=Interesting Information About The Multimedia Art Museum of Moscow [In English]|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Moscow (MAMM) intended to acquaint Russian audience with contemporary art and multimedia technologies. In 2005 the museum building on Ostozhenka street, 16 went under construction but the museum kept carrying on its exhibition and educational activities. In 2010 the Complex has returned to its renovated building numbering approximately {{convert|9000|sqm}} of space. 

Cumulative exhibition history of MAMM and Moscow House of Photography numbers more than 1300 exhibitions in Russia and abroad, average attendance of 30 to 35 thousands per month and more than 100 books issued.

[[File:Darwin's Pangenesis.svg|thumb|upright=2|[[Charles Darwin]]'s pangenesis theory postulated that every part of the body emits tiny particles called gemmules which migrate to the [[gonad]]s and are transferred to offspring. Gemmules were thought to develop into their associated body parts as offspring matures. The theory implied that changes to the body during an organism's life would be inherited, as proposed in [[Lamarckism]].]]

'''Pangenesis''' was [[Charles Darwin]]'s hypothetical mechanism for [[heredity]], in which he proposed that each part of the body continually emitted its own type of small organic particles called '''gemmules''' that aggregated in the [[gonad]]s, contributing heritable information to the [[gamete]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holterhoff, Kate |date=2014 |title=The History and Reception of Charles Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=47 |pages=661–695 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9377-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented this 'provisional hypothesis' in his 1868 work ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', intending it to fill what he perceived as a major gap in evolutionary theory at the time. The etymology of the word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''pan'' (a prefix meaning "whole", "encompassing") and ''genesis'' ("birth") or ''genos'' ("origin"). Pangenesis mirrored ideas originally formulated by [[Hippocrates]] and other pre-Darwinian scientists, but built off of new concepts such as [[cell theory]], explaining cell development as beginning with gemmules which were specified to be necessary for the occurrence of new growths in an organism, both in initial development and regeneration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|last=de Beer|first=Gavin|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|year=1965|isbn=|location=Garden City, New York|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also accounted for [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] and the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] concept of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, as a body part altered by the environment would produce altered gemmules. This made Pangenesis popular among the neo-Lamarckian school of evolutionary thought.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This hypothesis was made effectively obsolete after the 1900 rediscovery among [[biologist]]s of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theory of the [[Mendelian inheritance|particulate nature of inheritance]].

==Early history==

Pangenesis was similar to ideas put forth by [[Hippocrates]], [[Democritus]] and other pre-Darwinian scientists in proposing that the whole of parental organisms participate in heredity (thus the prefix ''pan'').&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zirkle | first1 = Conway | authorlink = Conway Zirkle | year = 1935 | title = The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis | url = | journal = [[The American Naturalist]] | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 417–445 | doi=10.1086/280617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin wrote that Hippocrates' pangenesis was "almost identical with mine—merely a change of terms—and an application of them to classes of facts necessarily unknown to the old philosopher."&lt;ref name="Deichmann 2010"&gt;Deichmann, Ute. (2010). ''Darwinism, Philosophy, and Experimental Biology''. Springer. pp. 41-42. {{ISBN|978-90-481-9901-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science historian [[Conway Zirkle]] wrote that:

{{quote|The hypothesis of pangenesis is as old as the belief in the inheritance of acquired characters. It was endorsed by [[Hippocrates]], [[Democritus]], [[Galen]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Lactantius]], [[St. Isidore of Seville]], [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]], [[St. Albert the Great]], [[St. Thomas of Aquinas]], [[Pietro de' Crescenzi|Peter of Crescentius]], [[Paracelsus]], [[Jerome Cardan]], [[Levinus Lemnius]], [[Nicolas Venette|Venette]], [[John Ray]], [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]], [[Charles Bonnet|Bonnet]], [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertius]], [[Albrecht von Haller|von Haller]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Zirkle demonstrated that the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics had become fully accepted by the 16th century and remained immensely popular through to the time of Lamarck's work, at which point it began to draw more criticism due to lack of hard evidence.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; He also stated that pangenesis was the only scientific explanation ever offered for this concept, developing from Hippocrates' belief that "the semen was derived from the whole body."&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; In the 13th century, pangenesis was commonly accepted on the principle that semen was a refined version of food unused by the body, which eventually translated to 15th and 16th century widespread use of pangenetic principles in medical literature, especially in gynecology.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; Later pre-Darwinian important applications of the idea included hypotheses about the origin of the differentiation of races.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt;

A theory put forth by [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] in 1745 called for particles from both parents governing the attributes of the child, although some historians have called his remarks on the subject cursory and vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |date=1981 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674364462 |pages=328, 646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|last=de Beer|first=Gavin|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|year=1965|isbn=|location=Garden City, New York|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749, French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] developed a hypothetical system of heredity much like Darwin's pangenesis, wherein 'organic molecules' were transferred to offspring during reproduction and stored in the body during development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hull, David L. (1988). ''Science as a Process: An Evolutionary Account of the Social and Conceptual Development of Science''. University of Chicago Press. p. 86. {{ISBN|0-226-36051-2}} "As Darwin was to discover many years later, Buffon had devised a system of heredity not all that different from his own theory of pangenesis."&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on Buffon's views, Darwin stated, "If Buffon had assumed that his organic molecules had been formed by each separate unit throughout the body, his view and mine would have been very closely similar."&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"/&gt;

In 1801, [[Erasmus Darwin]] advocated a hypothesis of pangenesis in the third edition of his book ''[[Zoonomia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Deichmann, Ute. (2010). ''Darwinism, Philosophy, and Experimental Biology''. Springer. p. 42. {{ISBN|978-90-481-9901-3}} "Among the other authors were Buffon, who proposes "organic molecules" with affinities to various organs, and, in particular, Erasmus Darwin, who in 1801 anticipated his grandson's concept of pangenesis, suggesting that small particles were given off by parts of the bodies of both parents; and that they are circulated in the blood, ending in the sexual organs from where they could be combined during reproduction in order to form the nucleus of an offspring."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1809, [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] in his ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'' put forth evidence for the idea that characteristics acquired during the lifetime of an organism, either from effects of the environment or  may be passed on to the offspring.  Charles Darwin first had significant contact with [[Lamarckism]] during his time at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] in the late 1820s, both through [[Robert Edmond Grant]], whom he assisted in research, and in Erasmus's journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=E. Janet|title=Charles Darwin: Vol. 1, Voyaging|date=1995|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|isbn=1-84413-314-1|pages=72–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's first known writings on the topic of Lamarckian ideas as they related to inheritance are found in a notebook he opened in 1837, also entitled ''Zoonomia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57383252|title=The Cambridge companion to Darwin|last=|first=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Hodge, M.

In 1861, Irish physician [[Henry Freke]] developed a variant of pangenesis in his book ''Origin of Species by Means of Organic Affinity''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Macalister|Macalister, Alexander]]. (1870). ''Reviews and Bibliographical Notices''. In ''[[Irish Journal of Medical Science|Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science]], Volume 50''. Fannin and Company. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Freke proposed that all life was developed from microscopic organic agents which he named ''granules'', which existed as 'distinct species of organizing matter' and would develop into different biological structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a944AAAAMAAJ&amp;rdid=book-a944AAAAMAAJ&amp;rdot=1|title=On the origin of species by means of organic affinity|last=Freke|first=Henry|date=1861|publisher=Longman and Co.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, four years before the publication of ''Variation'', [[Herbert Spencer]] in his book ''Principles of Biology'' proposed a theory of "physiological units" similar to Darwin's gemmules, which likewise were said to be related to specific body parts and responsible for the transmission of characteristics of those body parts to offspring.&lt;ref name="Deichmann 2010"/&gt; He also supported the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] idea of transmission of acquired characteristics.

Darwin had debated whether to publish a theory of heredity for an extended period of time due to its highly speculative nature. He decided to include pangenesis in ''Variation'' after sending a 30 page manuscript to his close friend and supporter [[Thomas Huxley]] in May 1865, which was met by significant criticism from Huxley that made Darwin even more hesitant.&lt;ref name="Geison69" /&gt; However, Huxley eventually advised Darwin to publish, writing: "Somebody rummaging among your papers half a century hence will find Pangenesis &amp; say 'See this wonderful anticipation of our modern Theories—and that stupid ass, Huxley, prevented his publishing them'"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-4875.html | title = Letter 4875 – Huxley, T. H. to Darwin, C. R., 16 July (1865) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's initial version of pangenesis appeared in the first edition of ''Variation'' in 1868, and was later reworked for the publication of a second edition in 1875.

==Theory==

=== Darwin ===
Darwin's pangenesis theory attempted to explain the process of [[sexual reproduction]], inheritance of traits, and complex [[developmental biology|developmental]] phenomena such as cellular [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] in a unified mechanistic structure.&lt;ref name="Geison69"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Geison | first1=G.

When passed on to offspring via the reproductive process, gemmules were thought to be responsible for developing into each part of an organism and expressing characteristics inherited from both parents.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Darwin thought this to occur in a literal sense: he explained cell proliferation to progress as gemmules to bind to more developed cells of their same character and mature. In this sense, the uniqueness of each individual would be due to their unique mixture of their parents’ gemmules, and therefore characters.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Similarity to one parent over the other could be explained by a quantitative superiority of one parent's gemmules.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|date=May 2008|title=A new perspective on Darwin’s Pangenesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2008.00036.x|journal=Biological Reviews|language=en|volume=83|issue=2|pages=141–149|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.2008.00036.x|issn=1464-7931|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yongshen Lu points out that Darwin knew of cells' ability to multiply by self-division, so it is unclear how Darwin supposed the two proliferation mechanisms to relate to each other.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He did clarify in a later statement that he had always supposed gemmules to only bind to and proliferate from developing cells, not mature ones.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-6442.xml;query=gemmule;brand=default|title=To Scientific Opinion|last=Darwin|first=Charles|date=October 20, 1869|work=Darwin Correspondence Project|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin hypothesized that gemmules might be able to survive and multiply outside of the body in a letter to J.

[[File:Gemmule cell proliferation (pangenesis).jpg|thumb|right|350px|Darwin's description of cell proliferation using pangenesis theory in ''The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication'']]

Some gemmules were thought to remain dormant for generations, whereas others were routinely expressed by all offspring. Every child was built up from selective expression of the mixture of the parents and grandparents' gemmules coming from either side. Darwin likened this to gardening: a flowerbed could be sprinkled with seeds "most of which soon germinate, some lie for a period dormant, whilst others perish."{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=276}} He did not claim gemmules were in the blood, although his theory was often interpreted in this way. Responding to [[Fleming Jenkin]]'s review of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', he argued that pangenesis would permit the preservation of some favourable variations in a population so that they wouldn't die out through blending.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=283}}

Darwin thought that environmental effects that caused altered characteristics would lead to altered gemmules for the affected body part. The altered gemmules would then have a chance of being transferred to offspring, since they were assumed to be produced throughout an organisms life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, pangenesis theory allowed for the Lamarckian idea of transmission of characteristics acquired through use and disuse. Accidental gemmule development in incorrect parts of the body could explain deformations and the 'monstrosities' Darwin cited in ''Variation''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== De Vries ===
[[Hugo de Vries]] characterized his own version of pangenesis theory in his 1889 book ''Intracellular Pangenesis'' with two propositions, of which he only accepted the first:

:I. In the cells there are numberless particles which differ from each other, and represent the individual cells, organs, functions and qualities of the whole individual. These particles are much larger than the chemical molecules and smaller than the smallest known organisms; yet they are for the most part comparable to the latter, because, like them, they can divide and multiply through nutrition and growth. They are transmitted, during cell-division, to the daughter-cells: this is the ordinary process of heredity.
:II. In addition to this, the cells of the organism, at every stage of development, throw off such particles, which are conducted to the germ-cells and transmit to them those characters which the respective cells may have acquired during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Vries|first=Hugo|title=Intracellular Pangenesis|url=http://www.esp.org/books/devries/pangenesis/facsimile/|accessdate=May 2, 2015|date=1910|origyear=1889|page=63|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vries also coined the term 'pangene' which 20 years later was shortened by [[Wilhelm Johannsen]] to [[gene]].

=== Other variants ===
Science historian [[E. Janet Browne|Janet Browne]] points out that while [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Carl von Nägeli]] also put forth ideas for systems of inheritance involving gemmules, their version of gemmules differed in that it contained "a complete microscopic blueprint for an entire creature."{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=281}} Spencer published his theory of "physiological units" three years prior to Darwin's publication of ''Variation''.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt;

She goes on to say that Darwin believed specifically in gemmules for each body part because they might explain how environmental effects could be passed on as characteristics to offspring.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=281}}

Interpretations and applications of pangenesis continued to appear frequently in medical literature up until [[August Weismann|Weismann's]] experiments and subsequent publication on germ-plasm theory in 1892.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; For instance, an address by Huxley spurred on substantial work by Dr. James Ross in linking ideas found in Darwin's pangenesis to the [[germ theory of disease]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Graft Theory of Disease: Being an Application of Mr. Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis to the Explanation of the Phenomena of the Zymotic Diseases|last=Ross|first=James|publisher=Lindsay and Blakiston|year=1872|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross cites the work of both Darwin and Spencer as key to his application of pangenetic theory.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Collapse ==

=== Galton's experiments on rabbits ===
Darwin's half-cousin [[Francis Galton]] conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to refute Charles Darwin's hypothetical theory of pangenesis. In consultation with Darwin, he set out to see if gemmules were transported in the blood.  In a long series of experiments from 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring. He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bulmer|2003|pp=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Galton|Galton]] was troubled because he began the work in good faith, intending to prove Darwin right, and having praised pangenesis in ''Hereditary Genius'' in 1869. Cautiously, he criticized his cousin’s theory, although qualifying his remarks by saying that Darwin's gemmules, which he called "pangenes," might be temporary inhabitants of the blood that his experiments had failed to pick up.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=291–292}}

Darwin challenged the validity of Galton's experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in ''Nature'' where he wrote:&lt;ref name=Darwin1871&gt;{{cite journal |author=Darwin, Charles R. |authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=27 April 1871 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1751&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=1 |title=Pangenesis |journal=Nature. A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Science |volume=3 |pages=502–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Now, in the chapter on Pangenesis in my ''Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,'' I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any circulating system. It is, indeed, obvious that the presence of gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood." He goes on to admit: "Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.&lt;ref name=Darwin1871/&gt;}}

After the circulation of Galton's results, the perception of pangenesis quickly changed to severe skepticism if not outright disbelief.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Weismann ===
[[File:Weismann's Germ Plasm.svg|thumb|[[August Weismann]]'s [[germ plasm]] theory. The hereditary material, the germ plasm, is confined to the gonads. Somatic cells (of the body) develop afresh in each generation from the germ plasm. The implied [[Weismann barrier]] between the germ line and the soma prevents Lamarckian inheritance.|270x270px]]

[[August Weismann]]'s idea, set out in his 1892 book ''Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung'' (The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/weismann_keimplasma_1892|title=Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung|author=Weismann, August|date=1892|publisher=Fischer|location=Jena|trans-title=The Germ Plasm: A theory of inheritance}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that the hereditary material, which he called the [[germ plasm]], and the rest of the body (the [[Somatic (biology)|soma]]) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. This distinction is commonly referred to as the [[Weismann barrier|Weismann Barrier]]. If correct, this made Darwin's pangenesis wrong and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails across multiple generations, was proposed as a proof of the non-existence of Lamarckian inheritance, although Peter Gauthier has argued that [[Weismann's experiment]] showed only that injury did not affect the germ plasm and neglected to test the effect of Lamarckian use and disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gauthier|first=Peter|date=March–May 1990|title=Does Weismann's Experiment Constitute a Refutation of the Lamarckian Hypothesis?|journal=BIOS|volume=61|pages=6–8|jstor=4608123|number=1/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weismann argued strongly and dogmatically for Darwinism and against neo-Lamarckism, polarising opinions among other scientists.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40193707|title=Neo-Lamarckism and the evolution controversy in France, 1870-1920|last=1940-|first=Persell, Stuart Michael,|date=1999|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=077348275X|location=Lewiston, NY|oclc=40193707}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to [[Eclipse of Darwinism|its eclipse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution: The History of an Idea|last=Bowler|first=Peter J.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-520-23693-6|edition=3rd completely rev. and expanded|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=253–256|authorlink=Peter J.

=== After pangenesis ===

Darwin's pangenesis theory was widely criticised, in part for its [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] premise that parents could [[inheritance of acquired characters|pass on traits acquired]] in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|last2=Li|first2=Xiuju|date=2014-09-23|title=Has Darwin's Pangenesis Been Rediscovered?|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/64/11/1037/2754242|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=64|issue=11|pages=1037–1041|doi=10.1093/biosci/biu151|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the neo-Lamarckians of the time seized upon pangenesis as evidence to support their case.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Italian Botanist Federico Delpino's objection that gemmules' ability to self-divide is contrary to their supposedly innate nature gained considerable traction; however, Darwin was dismissive of this criticism, remarking that the particulate agents of small pox and scarlet fever seem to have such characteristics.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lamarckism fell from favour after [[August Weismann]]'s research in the 1880s indicated that changes from use (such as lifting weights to increase muscle mass) and disuse (such as being lazy and becoming weak) were not heritable.&lt;ref name="ImaginaryLamarck"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.textbookleague.org/ |title=The Textbook Letter |last=Ghiselin |first=Michael T. |publisher=The Textbook League |publication-date=September–October 1994 |contribution=Nonsense in schoolbooks: 'The Imaginary Lamarck' |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin |accessdate=2008-01-23 |contribution-url=http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q |title=A History of the Life Sciences |last=Magner |first=Lois N. |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]], [[CRC Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-203-91100-6 |edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scientists continued to voice their support  in spite of Galton's and Weismann's results: notably, in 1900 Karl Pearson wrote that pangenesis "is no more disproved by the statement that ‘gemmules have not been found in the blood,’ than the atomic theory is disproved by the fact that no atoms have been found in the air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=PSwRAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=The+Grammar+of+Science&amp;ots=T5EHpFM1SO&amp;sig=1AasXoTNJ_snuqbDZwDknU7ilks#v=snippet&amp;q=atomic%20theory&amp;f=false|title=The Grammar of Science|last=Pearson|first=Karl|publisher=Adam and Charles Black|year=1900|isbn=9785877362529|location=London|pages=335|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the rediscovery of Mendel's Laws of Inheritance in 1900 led to pangenesis being fully set aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Beer|first1=Gavin|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|date=1965|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|location=Garden City, NY|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Huxley has observed that the later discovery of [[chromosome]]s and the research of [[T.

Some of Darwin's pangenesis principles do relate to heritable aspects of [[phenotypic plasticity]], although the status of gemmules as a distinct class of organic particles has been firmly rejected. However, starting in the 1950s, many research groups in revisiting Galton's experiments found that heritable characteristics could indeed arise in rabbits and chickens following DNA injection or blood transfusion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|date=2008|title=A new perspective on Darwin's Pangenesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2008.00036.x|journal=Biological Reviews|volume=83|issue=2|pages=141–149|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.2008.00036.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1940's in the work of Sopikov and others, and was later corroborated by researchers in Switzerland as it was being further developed by the Soviet scientists.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kosin, I.

Darwin himself had noted that "the existence of free gemmules is a gratuitous assumption"; by some accounts in modern interpretation, gemmules may be considered a prescient mix of DNA, RNA, proteins, prions, and other mobile elements that are heritable in a non-Mendelian manner at the molecular level.&lt;ref name="Geison69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="West=Eberhard08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West-Eberhard |first1=M.

'''Para Brahman''' ([[Sanskrit]]:परब्रह्मन्) ([[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Para Brahman}}'') is the "Highest [[Brahman]]" that which is beyond all descriptions and conceptualisations. It is described in Hindu texts as the formless (in the sense that it is devoid of [[Maya (religion)|Maya]]) spirit (soul) that eternally pervades everything, everywhere in the universe and whatever is beyond.&lt;ref name="PalHuyler2016p55"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pratapaditya Pal|author2=Stephen P.

Hindus conceptualize the Para Brahman in diverse ways. In the Advaita Vedanta tradition, ''Nirguna Brahman'' (Brahman without qualities) is Para Brahman. In other Vedanta traditions, it is ''[[Saguna brahman|Saguna Brahman]]'' (Brahman with qualities). In [[Vaishnavism]],[[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]],[[Vishnu]],  [[Shiva]] and [[Devi]] respectively, are Para Brahman.{{sfn|White|1970|p=156}}

Para Brahman means the "Highest Brahman". It is found in early Advaita Vedanta literature.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Comans (2002), The Method of Early Advaita Vedānta, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120817227}}, pages 129-130, 216-231&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advaita Vedanta - Nirguna Brahman==
''Nirguna Brahman'' ([[Devanagari]] निर्गुण ब्रह्मन्, ''Nirguṇa Brahman''), Brahman without form or qualities,{{sfn|Sullivan|2001|p=148}} is Para Brahman, the highest Brahman. According to [[Adi Shankara]], Nirguna Brahman is Para Brahman,{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=116}}{{sfn|Malkovsky|1997|p=541}} and is a state of complete knowledge of self as being identical with the transcendental Brahman, a state of mental-spiritual enlightenment (Jnana yoga).{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}} It contrasts with Saguna Brahman which is a state of loving awareness (Bhakti yoga).{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}} Advaita Vedanta non-dualistically holds that Brahman is divine, the Divine is Brahman, and this is identical to that which is [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (one's soul, innermost self) and nirguna (attribute-less), infinite, love, truth, knowledge, "being-consciousness-bliss".{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|pp=9-14}}

According to Eliot Deutsch, ''Nirguna Brahman'' is a "state of being"{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=12}} in which all dualistic distinctions between one's own soul and Brahman are obliterated and are overcome.{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}} In contrast, ''Saguna Brahman'' is where the distinctions are harmonized after duality between one's own soul and Brahman has been accepted.{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}}

Advaita describes the features of a nondualistic experience,{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}} in which a subjective experience also becomes an "object" of knowledge and a phenomenal reality. The Absolute Truth is both subject and object, so there is no qualitative difference:
* "Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavān." ([[Bhagavata Purana]] 1.2.11)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iskconpress.com/books/sb/1/2/11|title=Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 1.2.11|last=A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|''vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam, yaj jnanam advayam brahmeti paramatmeti, bhagavan iti sabdyate''}}
* "Whoever realizes the Supreme Brahma attains to supreme felicity. That Supreme Brahma is Eternal Truth (satyam), Omniscient (jnanam), Infinite (anantam)." ([[Taittiriya Upanishad]] 2.1.1){{refn|group=note|''brahma-vid apnoti param, tad eshabhyukta, satyam jnanam anantam brahma''}}

The Upanishads state that the Supreme Brahma is Eternal, Conscious, and Blissful [[Satcitananda|sat-chit-ânanda]]. The realisation of this truth is the same as ''being'' this truth:
* "The One is Bliss. Whoever perceives the Blissful One, the reservoir of pleasure, becomes blissful forever." ([[Taittiriya Upanishad]] 2.7.1-2){{refn|group=note|''raso vai sa, rasam hy evayam labdhvanandi bhavati''}}
* "Verily know the Supreme One to be Bliss." ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 2.9.28)

==Vaishnavism ==
In [[Vaishnavism]], [[Vishnu]] or [[Krishna]] (among other incarnations of Vishnu) is considered as Para Brahman.Vishnu in his Mahavishnu form is considered to be the supreme. According to Bhagavat Purana,when Arjuna asked the true reality about Krishna,he revealed his Mahavishnu form showing that he is the supreme form of souls,demons,deities and qualities,namely,Sattva,Rajas and Tamas.

==Shaivism==
In [[Shaivism]], [[Shiva]] is Para Brahman.Parashiva,the supreme form of Lord Shiva,is considered to the Para Brahman.According to mythology, Parashiva is not much significant in Vedas and Upanishads, but it is said that Lord Parashiva is the single incarnation of all souls and deities.He is also depicted as the only Adipurusha or Mahadeva.

==Shaktism==
In [[Shaktism]], Devi [[Kali|Mahakali]], the supreme form of Devi [[Adi parashakti]], is considered to the Para Brahman, ultimate reality, inseparably. According to Devi Suktam in [[Rigveda]] she is the womb of all creation. Thus Kali is epithets is Brahmamayi, meaning "She Whose Essence is Brahman". Her eternal abode is [[Manidvipa]].

== Sikhism ==
Parbrahm is regarded as the supreme reality in [[Sikhism]]. It is also known as "Akaal purakh" (immortal being) and is also known by mantra "[[Waheguru]]" . 

Sikh scripture and the last sikh guru, [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]] refers to Parbrahm with a variety of adjectives and nouns , such as Nirankar, Niranjan, Bhagat Vachhal , Kirpal , Dayal, Deen Dayal , Madho, Raam, Hari, Allah, Rahim, Karim, Rehman, Parvardigar, Sahib, Malik , etc.....

A '''person''' is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as [[reason]], [[morality]], [[consciousness]] or [[self-consciousness]], and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as [[kinship]], [[ownership]] of [[property]], or [[legal obligation|legal responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0169.xml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Craemer, Willy. “A Cross-Cultural Perspective on Personhood.” The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly. Health and Society, vol. 61, no. 1, 1983, pp. 19–34., www.jstor.org/stable/3349814.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Smith. 2003. Moral, Believing Animals: Human Personhood and Culture. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrithers, Michael, Steven Collins, and Steven Lukes, eds. 1985. The category of the person: Anthropology, philosophy, history. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The defining features of [[personhood]] and consequently what makes a person count as a person differ widely among cultures and contexts.

In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about [[personal identity]] and [[self]]: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.

The common plural of "person", "[[people]]", is often used to refer to an entire [[nation]] or [[ethnic group]] (as in "a people"). The plural "persons" is often used in [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[law|legal]] writing.

==Development of the concept==

In ancient Rome, the word ''[[persona]]'' (Latin) or ''[[prosopon]]'' (πρόσωπον; Greek) originally referred to the masks worn by actors on stage. The various masks represented the various "personae" in the stage play.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1911|title=Person|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm|accessdate=2011-03-09|last=Geddes|first=Leonard|volume=11|quote=The Latin word persona was originally used to denote the mask worn by an actor. From this, it was applied to the role he assumed, and, finally, to any character on the stage of life, to any individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of person was further developed during the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] and [[Christology|Christological]] debates of the 4th and 5th centuries in contrast to the word nature.&lt;ref&gt;Thisleton NIGNTC commentary on 1 Corinthians "Thinkers in ancient times had a difficulty in expressing the notion of personality"; Barfield in History of English Words “Take, for instance, the word person...Its present meaning of an individual human being is largely due to the theologians who hit upon it when they were looking for some term that would enable them to assert the trinity of Godhead without admitting more than one 'substance'"; John Zizioulas in ''Being as Communion'', 1985 New York:St Vladimirs Press p. 27 writes: "although the person and “personal identity” are widely discussed nowadays as a supreme ideal, nobody seems to recognize that historically as well as existentially the concept of the person is indissolubly bound up with theology."&lt;/ref&gt;  During the theological debates, some philosophical tools (concepts) were needed so that the debates could be held on common basis to all theological schools. The purpose of the debate was to establish the relation, similarities and differences between the Λóγος/''Verbum'' and God. The philosophical concept of person arose, taking the word "[[prosopon]]" (πρόσωπον) from the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. Therefore, Christus (the Λóγος/''Verbum'') and God were defined as different "persons". This concept was applied later to the Holy Ghost, the angels and to all human beings.

Since then, a number of important changes to the word's meaning and use have taken place, and attempts have been made to redefine the word with varying degrees of adoption and influence.

==Personhood==
[[File:Paul Klee WI (In Memoriam) 1938.jpg|thumb|An abstract painting of a person by [[Paul Klee]]. The concept of a person can be very challenging to define.]]
{{main article|Personhood}}

{{quotation|The criteria for being a person... are designed to capture those attributes which are the subject of our most humane concern with ourselves and the source of what we regard as most important and most problematical in our lives.|Harry G. Frankfurt|}}
Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in [[philosophy]] and [[law]], and is closely tied to legal and [[political]] concepts of [[citizenship]], [[equality before the law|equality]], and [[liberty]]. According to common worldwide general legal practice, only a [[natural person]] or [[legal personality]] has [[rights]], protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability]].
Personhood continues to be a topic of international debate, and has been questioned during the abolition of [[slavery]] and the fight for [[women's rights]], in debates about [[abortion]], [[fetal rights]], and in [[animal rights]] advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of non-human personhood, see Midgley, Mary. [http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/midgley01.htm "Persons and non-persons"], in Peter Singer (ed.) ''In Defense of Animals''. Basil Blackwell, 1985, pp. 52-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various debates have focused on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities. Historically, the personhood of animals, women, and slaves has been a catalyst of social upheaval. In most societies today, living adult humans are usually considered persons, but depending on the context, theory or definition, the category of "person" may be taken to include or not [[adultism|children]] or such [[Non human|non-human]] entities as [[animals]], [[artificial intelligences]], or [[extraterrestrial life]], as well as legal entities such as [[corporations]], [[sovereign states]] and other [[Polity|polities]], or [[estate (law)|estate]]s in [[probate]].&lt;ref&gt;For corporations, see [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html "Justices, 5-4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit"], ''The New York Times'', January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal identity==
[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|What does it take for individuals to persist from moment to moment – or in other words, for the same individual to exist at different moments?]]
{{main article|Personal identity}}

Personal identity is the [[Identity (philosophy)|unique identity]] of persons through time. That is to say, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the ''same'' person, persisting through time. In the modern [[philosophy of mind]], this concept of personal identity is sometimes referred to as the ''[[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]]'' problem of personal identity. The ''[[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]]'' problem is grounded in the question of what features or traits characterize a given person at one time.

Identity is an issue for both [[continental philosophy]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and [[analytic philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} A key question in continental philosophy is in what sense we can maintain the modern conception of identity, while realizing many of our prior assumptions about the world are incorrect.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Proposed solutions to the problem of personal identity include continuity of the physical body, continuity of an immaterial mind or soul, continuity of consciousness or memory,&lt;ref&gt;Stefaroi, P. (2015). Humanistic Personology: A Humanistic-Ontological Theory of the Person &amp; Personality. Applications in Therapy, Social Work, Education, Management and Art (Theatre).  Charleston SC, USA: CreateSpace.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[bundle theory]] of self,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} continuity of personality after the death of the physical body,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of post-mortal personhood, see Roth, S. (2013) ''Dying is only human. The case death makes for the immortality of the person''. Tamara Journal for Critical Organization Inquiry, Vol. 11, No. 2, pp. 35-39. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2260793]&lt;/ref&gt; and proposals that there are actually no persons or selves who persist over time at all.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

'''Polychotomous key''' refers to the number of alternatives which a decision point may have in a non-temporal hierarchy of independent variables. The number of alternatives are equivalent to the root or [[nth root]] of a mathematical or logical variable.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Decision points or independent variables with two states have a binary root that is referred to as a [[wiktionary:dichotomy|dichotomous]] key whereas, the term polychotomous key refers to roots which are greater than one or unitary and usually greater than two or binary. Polychotomous keys are used in [[troubleshooting]] to build troubleshooting charts and in classification/identification schemes with characteristics that have more than one attribute and the order of characteristics is not inherently based on the progression of time.

The '''presumption of innocence''' is the principle that one is considered innocent unless proven guilty. It was traditionally expressed by the [[List of legal Latin terms|Latin maxim]] ''ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat'' (“the burden of proof is on the one who declares, not on one who denies”).

In many [[State (polity)|states]], presumption of innocence is a [[legal right]] of the accused in a [[criminal trial]], and it is an international [[human right]] under the [[UN]]'s [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 11. Under the presumption of innocence, the [[legal burden of proof]] is thus on the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]], which must collect and present compelling evidence to the trier of fact. The trier of fact (a judge or a jury)  is thus restrained and ordered by law to consider only actual evidence and testimony presented in court. The prosecution must, in most cases prove that the accused is [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] beyond [[reasonable doubt]]. If reasonable doubt remains, the accused must be [[Acquittal|acquitted]].

Under the [[Justinian Codes]] and [[English common law]], the accused is presumed innocent in criminal proceedings, and in civil proceedings (like [[breach of contract]]) both sides must issue proof. 

== History ==

=== Roman law ===
The sixth century [[Digest_(Roman_law)|''Digest'']] of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (22.3.2) provides, as a general rule of evidence: ''Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Corpus/d-22.htm |title=Digesta seu Pandectae 22.3.2 |location=Grenoble |publisher=Université Pierre-Mendés-France |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdash}}"Proof lies on him who asserts, not on him  who denies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Alan |editor-last=Watson |editor-link=Alan Watson (legal scholar) |title=The Digest of Justinian |year=1998 |origyear=1985 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-8122-1636-9 |section=22.3.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is there attributed to the second and third century jurist [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paul]]. It was introduced in Roman criminal law by emperor [[Antoninus Pius]].&lt;ref name="Bury, pg. 527"&gt;See Bury, p. 527&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic law ===
Similar to that of Roman Law, Islamic law also holds the principle that the onus of proof is on the accuser or claimant based on a [[hadith]] documented by [[Al-Nawawi|Imam Nawawi]].&lt;ref&gt;Imam Nawawi. 1977. ''An-Nawawi’s Forty Hadith (Second Edition English Translation by Ezzedin Ibrahim)''. Damascus: Holy Koran Pub. House, Hadith No. 33&lt;/ref&gt; 'Suspicion' is also highly condemned, this also from a hadith documented by Imam Nawawi&lt;ref&gt;Riyaadus Shaaliheen, Hadith No. 1573&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Imam Bukhari]]&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Al-Bukhari (English Version), Vol. 8, Book 73, Hadith 90&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Imam Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim (English Version), Book 32, Hadith 6214&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages in Europe ===

After the fall of the Roman Empire, Europe fell back on [[Feudalism|feudal]] law. This included some [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] customs, including presumed guilt. The accused could prove his innocence by having, for example, twelve people swear that he could not have done what he was accused of. This tended to favor the nobility over the lower classes."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.thefinertimes.com/Middle-Ages/law-in-the-middle-ages.html |title=Law in the Middle Ages |publisher=The Finer Times |accessdate=January 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
[[File:William Garrow2.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[William Garrow]] coined the phrase "presumed innocent until proven guilty", insisting that defendants' accusers and their evidence be thoroughly tested in court]]

"Presumption of innocence" serves to emphasize that the prosecution has the obligation to prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt (or some other level of proof depending on the criminal justice system) and that the accused bears no burden of proof.&lt;ref name="Mueller"&gt;{{cite book
|author1=Mueller, Christopher B. |author2=Laird C. Kirkpatrick |title=Evidence; 4th ed. |year=2009 |publisher=Aspen (Wolters Kluwer) |isbn=978-0-7355-7968-2}} pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt; This is often expressed in the phrase ''innocent until proven guilty'', coined by the English lawyer [[William Garrow|Sir William Garrow]] (1760–1840).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Christopher|title=The Law Society of Upper Canada and Ontario's lawyers, 1797–1997|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1997|isbn=0-8020-4127-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrow insisted that accusers be robustly tested in court. An objective observer in the position of the juror must reasonably conclude that the defendant almost certainly committed the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Law of the Land |last=Rembar |first=Charles |year=1980 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn= |page=&lt;!-- needed --&gt; |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presumption of innocence was originally expressed by the French cardinal and jurist [[Jean Lemoine]] in the phrase "''item quilbet presumitur innocens nisi probetur nocens'' (a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty)", based on the legal inference that most people are not criminals.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;''Words and Phrases'' 1914, p. 1168&lt;/ref&gt; However, this referred not merely to the fact that the burden of proof rests on the prosecution in a criminal case, but the protections which a defendant should be given-prior [[notice]] of the accusation being made against them, the [[right of confrontation]], [[right to counsel]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarship.law.edu/scholar/172/ Innocent Until Proven Guilty: The Origins of a Legal Maxim] Kenneth Pennington A Ennio Cortese (3 Volumes. Roma: Il Cigno Galileo Galilei Edizioni, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
It is literally considered favorable evidence for the accused that automatically attaches at trial.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Coffin v. United States]]'', {{ussc|156|432|1895}} “the presumption of innocence is evidence in favor of the accused, introduced by the law in [their] behalf”&lt;/ref&gt; It requires that the [[trier of fact]], be it a juror or judge, begin with the presumption that the state is unable to support its assertion.&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt; To ensure this legal protection is maintained a set of three related rules govern the procedure of criminal trials.  The presumption means:&lt;ref name="Mueller"/&gt;

#With respect to the critical facts of the case—whether the crime charged was committed and whether the defendant was the person who committed the crime—the state has the entire burden of proof.
#With respect to the critical facts of the case, the defendant does not have any burden of proof whatsoever. The defendant does not have to testify, call witnesses or present any other evidence, and if the defendant elects not to testify or present evidence, this decision cannot be used against them.
#The jury or judge is not to draw any negative inferences from the fact the defendant has been charged with a crime and is present in court and represented by an attorney. They must decide the case solely on evidence presented during the trial.

This duty on the prosecution was famously referred to as the “golden thread” in the criminal law by [[John Sankey, 1st Viscount Sankey|Lord Sankey]] [[Lord Chancellor|LC]] in ''[[Woolmington v DPP]]'':
{{bquote|Throughout the web of the English criminal law one golden thread is always to be seen—that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt subject to what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception...}}

==The fundamental right==
This right is so important in modern [[democracy|democracies]], [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] and [[republic]]s that many have explicitly included it in their legal codes and constitutions:

* The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], article 11, states: "Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.".
* The [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] of the [[Council of Europe]] says (art. 6.2): "Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law". This convention has been adopted by [[treaty]] and is binding on all Council of Europe members. Currently (and in any foreseeable expansion of the EU) every country member of the [[European Union]] is also member to the Council of Europe, so this stands for EU members as a matter of course. Nevertheless, this assertion is iterated ''verbatim'' in Article 48 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]].
* In [[Canada]], [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11(d)]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] states: "Any person charged with an offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal".
* In the [[Constitution of Colombia|Colombian constitution]], Title II, Chapter 1, Article 29 states that "Every person is presumed innocent until proven guilty according to the law".
* In [[France]], article 9 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] 1789, which has force as [[constitution]]al law, begins:  "Any man being presumed innocent until he has been declared guilty ...".  The Code of Criminal Procedure states in its preliminary article that "any person suspected or prosecuted is presumed innocent for as long as their guilt has not been established"&lt;ref name="CPPprelim" /&gt; and the [[Jury|jurors']] oath repeats this assertion (article 304).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=323BC6F257637C73CC209B436A9FDD7D.tpdjo03v_1?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006167464&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20110106 Code de procédure pénale, article 304] {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exists a popular misconception that under French law, the accused is presumed guilty until proven innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Michael H.|title=French Law Presumes Accused Innocent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/23/opinion/l-french-law-presumes-accused-innocent-814392.html|accessdate=10 May 2017|work=[[New York Times]]|date=23 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Iran]], Article 37 of the [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] states: "Innocence is to be presumed, and no one is to be held guilty of a charge unless his or her guilt has been established by a competent court".
* In [[Italy]], the second paragraph of Article 27 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]] states: "A defendant shall be considered not guilty until a final sentence has been passed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Romania, article 23 of the [[Constitution of Romania|Constitution]] states that "any person shall be presumed innocent until found guilty by a final decision of the court."
* The [[Constitution of Russia]], in article 49, states that "Everyone charged with a crime shall be considered not guilty until his or her guilt has been proven in conformity with the federal law and has been established by the valid sentence of a court of law". It also states that "The defendant shall not be obliged to prove his or her innocence" and "Any reasonable doubt shall be interpreted in favor of the defendant".
* In the [[Constitution of the Republic of South Africa|South African Constitution]], section 35(3)''(h)'' of the [[Bill of Rights of South Africa|Bill of Rights]] states: "Every accused person has a right to a fair trial, which includes the right to be presumed innocent, to remain silent, and not to testify during the proceedings."
* Although the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] does not cite it explicitly, presumption of innocence is widely held to follow from the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]], [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|6th]], and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]] amendments. The case of ''[[Coffin v. United States]]'' (1895) established the presumption of innocence of persons accused of crimes. See also ''[[In re Winship]].''
* In [[New Zealand]], the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|New Zealand Bill of Rights 1990]] provides inter alia at section 25 (c) "Everyone who is charged with an offence has, in relation to the determination of the charge, the following minimum rights: (c) the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM225527.html New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 No 109 (as at 01 July 2013), Public Act 25 Minimum standards of criminal procedure – New Zealand Legislation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern practices==
[[File:07CFREU-Article48.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Article 48 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] affirms the right to the presumption of innocence]]
In the [[United Kingdom]] changes have been made affecting this principle. Defendants' previous convictions may in certain circumstances be revealed to juries. Although the suspect is not compelled to answer questions after formal arrest, failure to give information may now be prejudicial at trial. Statute law also exists which provides for criminal penalties for failing to decrypt data on request from the Police. If the suspect is unwilling to do so, it is an offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000023_en_1 |title=OPSI.gov.uk |publisher=OPSI.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens can therefore be convicted and imprisoned without any evidence that the encrypted material was unlawful. Furthermore, in sexual offence cases such as rape, where the sexual act has already been proved beyond reasonable doubt, there are a limited number of circumstances where the defendant has an obligation to adduce evidence that the complainant consented to the sexual act, or that the defendant reasonably believed that the complainant was consenting.  These circumstances include, for example, where the complainant was unconscious, unlawfully detained, or subjected to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/75 |title=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[statistics]], the '''principle of marginality''' is the fact that the average (or [[main effect|main]]) effects, of variables in an analysis are [[marginal distribution|marginal]] to their [[interaction effect]]—that is, the main effect of one [[explanatory variable]] captures the effect of that variable averaged over all values of a second explanatory variable whose value influences the first variable's effect. The principle of marginality implies that, in general, it is wrong to test, estimate, or interpret main effects of [[dependent and independent variables|explanatory variables]] where the variables interact or, similarly, to model interaction effects but delete main effects that are marginal to
them.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;Fox, J. [http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Courses/SPIDA/dummy-regression-notes.pdf Regression Notes].&lt;/ref&gt; While such models are interpretable, they lack applicability, as they ignore the dependence of a variable’s effect upon another variable’s value.

[[John Nelder|Nelder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nelder | first1 = J. A. |authorlink = John Nelder| title = A Reformulation of Linear Models | journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society | volume = 140 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–77 | doi = 10.2307/2344517 | year = 1977 | pmid =  | pmc = }} (Section 2.1: ''The Neglect of Marginality'')&lt;/ref&gt; and Venables&lt;ref name="venable"&gt;Venables, W.N. (1998). [http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS3/Exegeses.pdf "Exegeses on Linear Models"]. Paper presented to the S-PLUS User’s Conference Washington, DC, 8–9 October 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued strongly for the importance of this principle in [[regression analysis]].

== Regression form ==

If two independent continuous variables, say ''x'' and ''z'', both influence a [[dependent variable]] ''y'', and if the extent of the effect of each independent variable depends on the level of the other independent variable then the regression equation can be written as: 

:&lt;math&gt;y_i=a+bx_i+cz_i+d(x_iz_i)+ e_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' indexes observations, ''a'' is the intercept term, ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' are effect size parameters to be estimated, and ''e'' is the [[errors and residuals|error]] term. 

If this is the correct model, then the omission of any of the right-side terms would be incorrect, resulting in misleading interpretation of the regression results. 

With this model, the effect of ''x'' upon ''y'' is given by the [[partial derivative]] of ''y'' with respect to ''x''; this is &lt;math&gt;b+dz_i&lt;/math&gt;, which depends on the specific value &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; at which the partial derivative is being evaluated. Hence, the main effect of ''x'' – the effect averaged over all values of ''z'' – is meaningless as it depends on the design of the experiment (specifically on the relative frequencies of the various values of ''z'') and not just on the underlying relationships. Hence:

* In the case of interaction, it is wrong to try to test, estimate, or interpret a "main effect" coefficient ''b'' or ''c'', omitting the interaction term.&lt;ref&gt;See Venables, p.13: "... testing main effects in the presence of an interaction is a violation of the marginality principle".&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition:

* In the case of interaction, it is wrong not to include ''b'' or ''c'', because this will give incorrect estimates of the interaction. &lt;ref&gt;See Venables, p.14/15, about the S-Plus command &lt;code&gt;drop1&lt;/code&gt;, which does not drop the main effect terms from a model with interaction: "To my delight I see that marginality constraints between factor terms are by default honoured". In R, the marginality requirement of the &lt;code&gt;dropterm&lt;/code&gt; function (in package MASS) is stated in the Reference Manual.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The above regression model, with two independent continuous variables, is presented with a numerical example, in Stata, as Case 3 in [http://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stata/faq/what-happens-if-you-omit-the-main-effect-in-a-regression-model-with-an-interaction  What happens if you omit the main effect in a regression model with an interaction?].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The changing concept of family requires a subjective definition of what family entails. There is no contest that the relationship between husband and wife,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cvetic|first1=Goran|title=Immigration Cases in Strasbourg: The Right to Family Life Under Article 8 of the European Convention|journal=International and Comparative Law Quarterly|date=1987|volume=36|issue=3|page=650|doi=10.1093/iclqaj/36.3.647}}&lt;/ref&gt; unmarried (de facto) partners,&lt;ref&gt;''Johnston v Ireland'' (9697/82) ECHR 18 December 1986&lt;/ref&gt; parents and children,&lt;ref&gt;''Berrehab v the Netherlands'' (3/1987/126/177; 10730/84) ECHR 28 May 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; siblings,&lt;ref&gt;''Olsson v Sweden'' (10465/83) ECHR 24 March 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and ‘near relatives’ such as between grandparents and grandchildren&lt;ref&gt;''Marckx v Belgium'' 2 EHRR 330.&lt;/ref&gt; represents family as required under the right to family life. Challenge exists where modern forms of family relationships have developed that the law has not yet explicitly recognised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Donnell|first1=Kath|title=The Unmarried Father and the Right to Family Life: ''Keegan v. Ireland''|journal=Maastricht Journal of European and Comparative Law|date=1995|volume=2|issue=1|page=85|doi=10.1177/1023263X9500200107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “existence… of family life is a question of fact” and is decided subjectively under each factual scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Nadia|last1=Melehi |title=The right to family life free from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation: the European and Inter-American perspectives|date=2014|journal= American University International Law Review |volume=29|page= 954}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has stated that when considering what constitutes family relationships the Court “must necessarily take into account developments in society and changes in the perception of social, civil-status and relational issues, including the fact that there is not just one way or one choice in the sphere of leading and living one’s family or private life”.&lt;ref&gt;''Villianatos and Others v Greece'' (29381/09 &amp; 32684/09) [2013] ECHR (7 November 2013), at [84].&lt;/ref&gt; Established family ties can be broken.&lt;ref&gt;Ivana Roagna “Protecting the right to respect for private and family life under the European Convention on Human Rights” (2012) Council of Europe Human Rights Handbooks, at 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the right to marry==
The right to marry is closely related to the right to family life, however the two rights are not identical. The right to marry is explicitly provided for in all human rights instruments,&lt;ref&gt;European Convention on Human Rights, Article 12; American Convention on Human Rights, Article 17; International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 23(1); African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, Article 18; Universal Declaration on Human Rights, Article 16; European Social Charter, Article 16; International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 10.&lt;/ref&gt; essentially providing that all people have the right to marry and found a family. The right to family life predominantly refers to an individual's right to create and maintain their family relationships. It was clarified in ''X, Y and Z v United Kingdom'' that in the situation where a spouse has been deported from their partner's State due to their nationality, there is no infringement on the right to marry as the individuals are already married, and so the right to family life must be considered.&lt;ref&gt;''X, Y &amp; Z v United Kingdom'' (GC) 22 April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
The main area of conflict arises between the ability of States to control entry and residence within its borders and the impact this control has over an individual’s right to family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burchill|first1=Richard|title=The Right to Live Wherever You Want? The Right to Family Life following the UN Human Rights Committee's Decision in ''Winata''|journal=Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights|date=2003|volume=21|issue=2|doi=10.1177/016934410302100204|ref=harv|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[International Law|international law]] the general principle holds that a State has the right to regulate entry and residence within its own territory.&lt;ref&gt;''Chahal v United Kingdom'' (22414/93) [1996] ECHR 54 (15 November 1996), at [73].&lt;/ref&gt; When this power of control results in the deportation of an individual, this may cause a breach of an individual's right to stay with their family. This conflict occurs where the immigrant is the spouse, parent or relative of a State's citizen, and the State wishes to remove or refuse entry to the immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;Emmet Whelan “The right to family live v immigration control: the application of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in Ireland” (2006) Hibernian Law Journal 6, at 93.&lt;/ref&gt; When a challenge is brought forward to the Courts or monitoring bodies, a balance must be struck between the rights of the State to enforce immigration laws and maintain public order, and the impact the enforcement of said laws will have on an individual's right to family life.{{sfn|Burchill|2003|p=234}} It has been emphasised that it is not the task of monitoring bodies to “supervise the government's immigration policy, but to examine whether the applicant’s right to respect for family life had been ensured without discrimination”.&lt;ref&gt;''Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v United Kingdom'' (1985) 7 EHRR 471.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International instruments==
Both Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide basis for the right to family life as a fundamental human right.

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 10 December 1948, clarifying universal rights held by all individuals regardless of subjective factors.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moeckli, Sangeeta Shah and Sandesh Sivakumaran International Human Rights Law (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, 2014) at 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the UDHR now represents customary international law, and as such has legally binding force over States.

The pertinent provision relating to the right to family lies in Article 16(3) of the UDHR:

{{Quote|text=3. The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration on Human Rights, Article 16(3) accessed at &lt;http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights===
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on the 16 December 1966, and came into force on the 23 March 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Adam McBeth, Justine Nolan and Simon Rice The International Law of Human Rights (Oxford University Press, Australia, 2011) at 251.&lt;/ref&gt; As at May 2016 there are 168 State parties to the ICCPR, giving effect to the civil and political rights of individuals within their borders.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, accessed at &lt; https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-4&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Articles 17 and 23(1) ICCPR refer to the right to family:

Article 17:
{{Quote|text=1.	No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.
2.	Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.}}

Article 23(1):
{{Quote|text=1. The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.}}

The Human Rights Committee has noted that the protection of the family and its members is also directly and indirectly guaranteed by other Articles within the Covenant in addition to Articles 17 and 23, such as protection of the child under Article 24.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Committee “General Comment No 19 of 1990, Article 23” (1994) UN Doc HRI/GEN/1/Rev.1 at 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case Law====
''Winata v Australia'' &lt;ref&gt;''Winata v Australia'' Communication No. 930/2000 (16 August 2001) UN Doc. CCPR/C/72/D/930/2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

This case was based on applications made by Hendrick Winata and So Lan Li under Articles 17, 23(1) and 24(1) of the ICCPR alleging that the removal of Winata and Li from Australia, where their adolescent son held residency, would amount a violation of their fundamental human rights, specifically that of their right to family.{{sfn|Burchill|2003|p=227}} Both Winata and Li were living illegally in Australia, and were facing deportation by the State. It was claimed that through either the separation of Winata and Li from their son through deportation, or the forced removal of the whole family unit to Indonesia, there would be interference with the fundamental family unit that was not compatible with the State's protection obligations to the right to family under the ICCPR. Australia argued that the application was inadmissible and incompatible with the provisions of the ICCPR, emphasising the ICCPR provides protection “only [to] a right to family life, not a right to family life in a particular country.”{{sfn|Burchill|2003|p=229}} The majority view of the [[Human Rights Committee]] found in favour of Winata and Li, holding that while individuals may not have the right to decide where they reside, States are obligated to protect all of the rights within the ICCPR. The Committee recognised the importance of State's control over immigration within their territory, however this discretion is “not unlimited”.&lt;ref&gt;''Winata v Australia'' Communication No. 930/2000 (16 August 2001) UN Doc. CCPR/C/72/D/930/2000 at 7.3.&lt;/ref&gt; It was held that deportation of Winata and Li would constitute a violation of Article 17 and 23(1) ICCPR.

Prior to this case international practice indicated that it was for States to determine who could reside in their territory, even where an infringement of Article 23 would arguably occur.{{sfn|Burchill|2003|p=226}} The Committee’s decision in this instance challenges this assumption, indicating that an individual's right to family life receives precedence over States’ ability to control residence within their territory.

===International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights===
The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) was also adopted by the General Assembly on 16 December 1966, however it did not enter into force till nine years after it opened for signature on 3 January 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Adam McBeth, Justine Nolan and Simon Rice The International Law of Human Rights (Oxford University Press, Australia, 2011) at 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 10(1) provides for the right to family:

{{Quote|text=1. The widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family, which is the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly for its establishment and while it is responsible for the care and education of dependant children.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 10 accessed at &lt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Europe==
Within Europe the European Convention on Human Rights and the [[European Social Charter]] stand as foundational human rights instruments.

===European Convention on Human Rights===
Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) states:

{{Quote|text=1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.
2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&lt;ref&gt;European Convention on Human Rights, Article 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Article imposes both positive and negative obligations on States; not only is the State required to protect its constituents from arbitrary interference in family life by public authorities,&lt;ref&gt;''Belgian Linguistics case (No. 2)'' (1968) 1 EHRR 252, at 33[7].&lt;/ref&gt; it must also provide within its domestic legal system safeguards that allow the development of a “normal family life”.&lt;ref&gt;''Marckx v Belgium'' 2 EHRR. 330, at [31].&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Article 8 applies to both “legitimate” and “illegitimate” family, with no distinction between the two qualifications within the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;''Marckx v Belgium'' 2 EHRR. 330, at [31].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case Law====
''EM (Lebanon) (FC) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department''&lt;ref&gt;''EM (Lebanon) (FC) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department'' [2008] UKHL 64, [2008] 3 W.L.R. 931.&lt;/ref&gt;

This case involved a second appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State for the Home Department that EM and her son (AF) must return to Lebanon, the appellant’s country of origin. EM had fled from Lebanon with AF following a violent marriage and resulting divorce. Under Lebanese Shari’a law, the physical custody of the child must be transferred to the father or a male family member once the child reaches seven years of age. AF was over the age of seven, and so would have all custodial rights transferred to his paternal father upon return to Lebanon. EM argued that the forced removal to Lebanon by the United Kingdom would result in a direct breach of both her and AF’s right to family life under Article 8 of the ECHR. The Court held that removal of the appellant and her son to Lebanon would violate both EM and AF’s Article 8 rights, and granted the appeal. This decision is significant, representing the first successful Article 8 claim in a foreign case.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Palmer and A. T. H Smith “Protecting the Right to Respect for Family Life in “Foreign” Cases” (2009) The Cambridge Law Journal 68(3) at 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Social Charter===
The European Social Charter (the Charter) is the counterpart to the European Convention on Human Rights, providing for fundamental social and economic rights under a [[Council of Europe]] treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe “The European Social Charter” (2016) accessed at &lt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/turin-european-social-charter&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter also provides for the right to family under Article 16, reaffirming European parties commitment to the right:

{{Quote|text=With a view to ensuring the necessary conditions for the full development of the family, which is a fundamental unit of society, the Contracting Parties undertake to promote the economic, legal and social protection of family life by such means as social and family benefits, fiscal arrangements, provision of family housing, benefits for the newly married, and other appropriate means.&lt;ref&gt;The European Social Charter, Article 16 accessed at &lt;https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168007cf93&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other international instruments==

===Americas===
The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] is a regional human rights treaty that similarly provides for the right to family life under Article 17(1):
{{Quote|text=1. The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state.&lt;ref&gt;American Convention on Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Africa===
The protection of the family and vulnerable groups is specified under the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights in Article 18, stating:
{{Quote|text=1. The family shall be the natural unit and basis of society. It shall be protected by the State which shall take care of its physical health and moral.
2. The State shall have the duty to assist the family which is the custodian of morals and traditional values recognized by the community.}}

The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights was adopted by the Organisation of African Unity in 1981 and entered into force on 21 October 1986.

===United Kingdom===
Within the United Kingdom the right to family life is a ‘qualified right’ under the Human Rights Act 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Citizens Advice “When can a public authority interfere with your human rights?” (2016) accessed at &lt;https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-rights/civil-rights/human-rights/when-can-a-public-authority-interfere-with-your-human-rights/&gt;; Human Rights Act (UK) 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; This qualification allows a public authority to interfere with the right to family life if it is in protection of others' rights or in the interest of the wider community. On 9 July 2012 new Immigration Rules came into effect within the United Kingdom, affording greater weight to the States' ability to control entry and residence as compared to the individual right to family life.&lt;ref&gt;The London School of Economics and Political Science “Deportation and the right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 HRA” February 2013, accessed from &lt; http://www.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/documents/2011/KlugDeportation.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a presumption that decisions made under the Immigration Rules will breach Article 8 of the ECHR only in “genuinely exceptional circumstances”.&lt;ref&gt;The London School of Economics and Political Science “Deportation and the right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 HRA” February 2013, accessed from &lt; http://www.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/documents/2011/KlugDeportation.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  This presumption significantly limits individual’s ability to successfully challenge decisions they believe have breached their fundamental right to family life.

{{Use British English|date=October 2016}}
[[File:French-roundel.svg|thumb|right|The [[Flag of France|''Tricolore'']] cockade of the [[French Air Force]] was first used on military aircraft before the First World War&lt;ref name="rafmu"/&gt;]]

A '''roundel''' is a circular disc used as a symbol. The term is used in [[heraldry]], but also commonly used to refer to a type of [[nation]]al insignia used on [[military aircraft]], generally circular in shape and usually comprising concentric rings of different colours. Other symbols also often use round shapes.

==Heraldry==
{{Main|Roundel (heraldry)}}
In [[heraldry]], a ''roundel'' is a circular [[charge (heraldry)|charge]].  ''Roundels'' are among the oldest charges used in [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], dating from at least the twelfth century. Roundels in British heraldry have different names depending on their [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Fox-Davies | first= Arthur Charles | year=1909 | title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry | page=151 |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41617/41617-h/41617-h.htm#page151|publisher = Gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while a roundel may be [[blazon]]ed by its tincture, e.g., ''a roundel vert'' (literally "a roundel green"), it is more often described by a single word, in this case ''pomme'' (literally "apple", from the French) or, from the same origins, ''pomeis''—as in "Vert; on a cross Or five pomeis".&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Public Register vol. 32, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

One special example of a named roundel is the [[fountain (heraldry)|fountain]], depicted as ''a roundel barry wavy argent and azure'', that is, containing alternating horizontal wavy bands of blue and silver (or white).

==Military aircraft==
{{Main|Military aircraft insignia}}
[[File:Hurricane.r4118.ground.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Hawker Hurricane]] showing a [[Second World War]]-era [[Royal Air Force roundels|Royal Air Force roundel]]]]

The [[History of the Armée de l'Air (1909–1942)|French Air Service]] originated the use of roundels on military aircraft during the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref name="rafmu"/&gt; The chosen design was the French national [[Cockade#Cockades of the European military|cockade]], whose colours are the blue-white-red of the [[flag of France]]. Similar national cockades, with different ordering of colours, were designed and adopted as aircraft roundels by their allies, including the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] and the [[United States Army Air Service]]. After the First World War, many other [[air force]]s adopted roundel insignia, distinguished by different colours or numbers of concentric rings.

The term "roundel" is often used even for those military aircraft insignia that are not round, like the [[Cross pattee|Iron Cross]]-[[Balkenkreuz]] symbol of the [[German Air Force|Luftwaffe]] or the [[red star]] of the [[Russian Air Force]].{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Flags==
Among flags which display a roundel are the [[flag of Bangladesh]] and the [[flag of Japan]].

Flags for British overseas dependencies are often a British [[Blue Ensign]] [[defacement (flag)|defaced]] with a white roundel displaying the [[coat of arms|arms]] or [[heraldic badge|badge]] of the dependency. The same pattern is used for all the states of Australia except [[Flag of Victoria|Victoria]].

==In popular culture==
[[File:Mod symbol.svg|thumbnail|right|140px|[[The Who]] logo incorporates the roundel symbol used by [[Mod (subculture)|mods]]]]

* The roundel, especially that used by the [[Royal Air Force]], has been associated with [[pop art]] of the 1960s, appearing in paintings by [[Jasper Johns]]. It became part of the pop consciousness when British rock group [[The Who]] wore [[Royal Air Force roundels|RAF roundels]] (and [[Union Flag]]s) as part of their stage apparel at the start of their career. Subsequently it came to symbolise [[Mod (subculture)|Mods]] and the [[Mod revival]].
* Some of [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]]'s material involves the use of a roundel in psychedelic colours.
* [[Ben Harper]]'s album ''[[Fight For Your Mind]]'' uses roundels from several air forces as graphics in the liner notes.
* In the British television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the circular decorations on the interior walls of the [[TARDIS]] control room are known as roundels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Russell | first=Gary | year=2006 | title=Doctor Who: The Inside Story | location=London | publisher=BBC Books | page=86 |isbn=0-563-48649-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8433">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Royal ''we''}}
{{for|the song by Silversun Pickups|The Royal We}}
{{Refimprove|date=May 2011}}

The '''royal ''we''''', or '''majestic plural''' ({{lang|la|pluralis maiestatis}}), is the use of a [[plural]] [[pronoun]] (or corresponding plural-inflected verb forms) to refer to a single person who is a [[monarch]]. The more general word for the use of a ''we'', ''us'', or ''our'' to refer to oneself is ''[[nosism]]''.

Speakers employing the royal we refer to themselves using a [[grammatical number]] other than the singular (i.e., in plural or [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form). For example, in his manifesto confirming the abdication of Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] begins: "By the Grace of God, We, Alexander I, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias ....".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperialhouse.ru/en/dynastyhistory/dinzak3/1097.html|title=Russian Imperial House - Manifesto of Emperor Alexander I, Confirming the Abdication of Tsesarevich and Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich and Designating Grand Duke Nicholas Pavlovich as Heir, 16 August 1823|author=|date=|website=www.imperialhouse.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Western usage ==
It is commonly employed by a person of high office, such as a monarch, earl, or [[pope]]. It is also used in certain formal contexts by [[bishop]]s and university [[Rector (academia)|rectors]]. [[William Longchamp]] is credited with its introduction to England in the late 12th century, following the practice of the [[Chancery of Apostolic Briefs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Longchamp, William de (''d''. 1197) |url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16980 |last=Turner |first=Ralph V. |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=May 2007 |doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/16980 |accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the public situations in which it is used, the monarch or other dignitary is typically speaking not only in his or her personal capacity but also in an official capacity as leader of a nation or institution. In the grammar of several languages, plural forms tend to be perceived as deferential and more polite than singular forms. This grammatical feature is common in languages that have the [[T-V distinction]].  English used to have this feature but lost it over time, largely by the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="UofAriz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Politeness in Early Modern English: the second person pronouns|url=http://www2.nau.edu/~eng121-c/politenessin%20AME.htm|website=Northern Arizona University|publisher=Arizona Board of Regents|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In diplomatic letters, such as [[Letter of credence|letters of credence]], it is customary for monarchs to use the singular first-person (''[[I (pronoun)|I]]'', ''me'', ''my'') when writing to other monarchs, while the majestic plural is used in royal letters to a president of a republic.&lt;ref name="satow1932"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Satow|first1=Ernest Mason|title=A Guide to Diplomatic Practice|date=1932|publisher=Longmans|location=London|page=37|quote=In these letters the plural "We" and "Our" are employed instead of "I" and "My," and the letters terminate thus: "Your Good Friend." This form is used mainly for Royal letters to Presidents of Republics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Commonwealth realms]], the sovereign discharges his/her [[Commission (document)#Examples of military and naval commissions|commissions to ranked military officers]] in the capacity of ''we''.  Many official documents published in the name of the monarch are also presented with royal ''we'', such as [[letters patent]], [[proclamation]], etc.

Popes have historically used the ''we'' as part of their formal speech, for example as used in ''[[Notre charge apostolique]]'', ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'', and ''[[Non abbiamo bisogno]]''.  
Since [[Pope John Paul II]], however, the royal ''we'' has been dropped by popes in public speech, although formal documents may have retained it.  Recent papal documents dispensed with the majestic plural in the original Latin are given with the singular ''I'' in their official English translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430185550/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/ |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=November 2012}}

In 1989, [[Margaret Thatcher]], then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], was met with disdain by some in the press for using the royal ''we'' when announcing news that she had become a grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phrase Finder''. [http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/401700.html "We are a grandmother"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-Western usage ==
Several prominent [[Names of God in Judaism|epithets]] of the [[Tanakh|Bible]] describe the [[Jewish God]] in plural terms: ''[[Elohim]]'', ''[[Adonai]]'', and ''[[El Shaddai]]''. Many Christian scholars, including the post-apostolic leaders and  [[Augustine of Hippo]], have seen the use of the plural and grammatically singular verb forms as support for the doctrine of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=On the Trinity |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1301.htm |publisher=New Advent |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of this poetic device is somewhere in the 4th century AD, during the Byzantine period. Therefore, none of the authors of the books of the Bible understood the unusual grammar as a "royal we".

In the Quran, God sometimes refers to Himself as "We". Muslim exegits and theologians teach that this is specifically when referring to His great power and majesty. They understood it similar to modern Rabbinical understanding of the majestic plural. 

In [[Imperial China]] and every monarchy within its [[East Asian cultural sphere|cultural orbit]] (including [[Japanese Empire|Japan]], [[Korean Empire|Korea]], and [[Vietnamese Empire|Vietnam]]), the majestic imperial pronoun was expressed by the [[Chinese character|character]] ''zhèn'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|朕}}}}) ([[Old Chinese]]: ''*lrəmʔ''). This was in fact the former Chinese first-person {{em|singular}} pronoun (that is, 'I'). However, following his [[Qin's wars of unification|unification of China]], the [[List of rulers of China|emperor]] [[Shi Huangdi]] arrogated it entirely for his personal use. All other speakers and writers were obliged to choose some [[Chinese honorifics|deferential epithet]] (such as ''yú'' ({{lang|zh|愚}}), 'this foolish one') instead of using the former pronoun. While this practice did not affect the non-Chinese countries as much since their variants of ''zhèn'' ({{lang|zh|朕}}) were generally imported loanwords, it nevertheless led to a polite avoidance of pronouns throughout East Asia. {{Crossreference|(For more information, see: [[Japanese pronouns]], [[Korean pronouns]], and [[Vietnamese pronouns]])}}. This still persists, except in [[China]], following the [[May Fourth Movement]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. In [[Modern Standard Mandarin]], the first-person singular is ''wǒ'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|我}}}}), which gradually emerged from a common epithet expressing 'this [worthless] body'.&lt;ref&gt;''ZDic'', {{lang|zh|《漢典》}} [''Chinese Dictionary'']. [http://www.zdic.net/z/1a/js/6211.htm "我"]. Accessed 22 August 2013. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{contradict inline|wikt:我#Etymology|date=September 2018}}. {{Crossreference|(See also [[Chinese Pronouns]].)}} 

In [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and other [[Indo-Aryan languages]], the majestic plural is a common way for elder speakers to refer to themselves when addressing those younger than them, and also for persons of higher social rank or [[Indian caste system|caste]] to refer to themselves when speaking to those of a perceived inferior rank or caste. In certain communities, the singular plural (मैं, 'I') may be dispensed with altogether for self-reference, and the plural [[nosism]] used uniformly while speaking to a social inferior or superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sante Monachesi''' (1910-1991), was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Painting|painter]] belonging to the modern movement of the ''[[Scuola romana]] (Roman School)'' and founder in 1932 of the ''Movimento Futurista nelle Marche ([[Futurism|Futurist]] Movement of [[Marche]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[:it:Emilio Villa|E. Villa]] ed., ''Sante Monachesi'', [[Rome]], 1970, Intro.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Monachesi studied at the ''[[Centro sperimentale di cinematografia|Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia]]'' (Experimental film centre or Italian National film school) in [[Rome]]. In the 1930s he embraced Futurism with spiralist and diagonal shapes both in painting and in sculpture, experimenting with [[aluminium]] in a mobile light.

An important representative of ''[[Aeropittura]]'' (Aeropainting), in 1936 he exhibited at [[Biennale di Venezia]] and in 1937 at the [[World Expo]] of [[Paris]].

Immediately after [[World War II]], Monachesi did [[expressionism|expressionist]] and [[fauve art|fauve]] painting, also as a member of the ''[[Scuola Romana]]'', becoming part of the group of "Balduina" with David Grazioso and Ferdinando Bellorini, but it was especially in [[plastic arts|plastic]] [[sculpture]] that his research became innovative. He explored new materials and compositions, and on the occasion of the [[Moon landing]], he founded the ''Agrà Movement'', a [[futurism|futurist]] current looking at these exalting successes of technology and thus expresses in artwork the absence of gravity, the [[Zero-G]] that by subtracting from bodies their terrestrial weight, proposes to free man and art from all conditioning.

Monachesi's pieces in coloured [[methacrylate]] are truly dynamic action-sculptures: "... the artist moulds the transparent and fluorescent perpex sheet, and succeeds in capturing and freeing the void of the full figure it circumscribes," (Floriano de Santis, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. S. Papetti, ed., ''Monachesi. Gli anni Quaranta e Cinquanta'' (Monachesi. The 1940s and 1950s), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Perspex and ''evelpiume'' introduce two new materials into Art: [[rubber foam]] and [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|polymethacrylate]], neglected by the contemporary [[Figurative art|figurative]] language until 1959.

Monachesi introduced "nomadic sculptures", where the artist ties and melts the foam sheet, continuously creating new forms and shapes. They were defined "primary forms of matter and cosmos" by art critic Franco Passoni,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. F. Passoni, [http://openlibrary.org/works/OL4565352W/Art_and_plastics ''Art and plastics''], 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; well qualifies the [[Jesolo]] Exhibition of 1978, which Monachesi entitled ''To Tie &amp; To Dissolve''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8662">While [[epidemiology]] is "the study of the distribution and determinants of states of health in populations", social epidemiology is "that branch of epidemiology concerned with the way that social structures, institutions, and relationships influence health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Lisa F. |last1=Berkman |first2=Ichiro |last2=Kawachi |chapter=A Historical Framework for Social Epidemiology: Social Determinants of Population Health |pages=1–16 |chapterurl={{Google books|ReTRAwAAQBAJ|page=1|plainurl=yes}} |year=2014 |editor1-first=Lisa F. |editor1-last=Berkman |editor2-first=Ichirō |editor2-last=Kawachi |editor3-first=M.

Although health research is often organized by disease categories or organ systems, theoretical development in social epidemiology is typically organized around factors that influence health (i.e., health determinants rather than health outcomes). Many social factors are thought to be relevant for a wide range of health domains. Social epidemiology can therefore address any health outcome, including chronic disease, infectious disease, mental health, and clinical outcomes or disease prognosis. Exposures of interest to social epidemiologists include individual-level measures (e.g., poverty, education, social isolation), contextual factors (e.g., residential segregation or income inequality), and social policies (e.g., policies creating income security or promoting educational access). Analyses that address the independent or synergistic effects of individual or contextual risk factors are often of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9491010 |pmc=1508189 |year=1998 |author1=Diez-Roux |first1=A.

Major research challenges in social epidemiology include tools to strengthen causal inference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.07.045 |pmid=27575286 |title=Causal inference challenges in social epidemiology: Bias, specificity, and imagination |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=166 |pages=258–265 |year=2016 |last1=Glymour |first1=M.

For example, questions of interest to epidemiologists include:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* Why have racial and economic inequalities in premature mortality persisted for generations even as the specific diseases causing premature death have completely changed?
* Do changes in social policies regulating social safety nets, human capital development, employment, occupational conditions, housing, or residential segregation influence the health of individuals? 
* Do social conditions at specific periods of life, for example early life developmental periods, disproportionately influence later health outcomes compared to exposures at later ages?
* Do adverse experiences such as chronic psychological stress, trauma, racism, or shame influence health and if so, what are the biological mechanisms of these effects?

Social epidemiology draws on methodologies and theoretical frameworks from many disciplines, and research overlaps with several social science fields, most notably [[economics]], [[medical anthropology]], [[medical sociology]], [[health psychology]] and [[medical geography]], as well as many domains of epidemiology.  However, intersecting social science fields often use health and disease in order to explain specifically social phenomenon (such as the growth of lay [[health advocacy]] movements),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7560848 |jstor=2626956 |year=1995 |author1=Brown |first1=P |title=Naming and framing: The social construction of diagnosis and illness |journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior |volume=Spec No |pages=34–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while social epidemiologists generally use social concepts in order to explain patterns of health in the population.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

More recently, the discipline is moving from identifying health inequalities along the social gradient to identifying the policies, programmes and interventions that effectively tackle the observed socioeconomic inequalities in health. Researchers Frank Pega and Ichiro Kawachi from Harvard University have suggested that this may lead to the new discipline of Political Epidemiology, which is more policy-applied in that it identifies effective and cost-effecfive social interventions for government action to improve health equity.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.06.007"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Politics, policies and population health: a commentary on Mackenbach, Hu and Looman (2013) |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=93 |pages=176–9 |year=2013 |doi= 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.06.007 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Kawachi |first2=Ichiro |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan  |last4=Lundberg |first4=Olle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical logic]], with its intended semantics, the truth values are ''[[logical truth|true]]''&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;T), and ''[[false (logic)|untrue]]'' or ''[[false (logic)|false]]''&amp;nbsp;(0&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;⊥); that is, classical logic is a [[two-valued logic]]. This set of two values is also called the [[Boolean domain]]. Corresponding semantics of [[logical connective]]s are [[truth function]]s, whose values are expressed in the form of [[truth table]]s. [[Logical biconditional]] becomes the [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] binary relation, and [[negation]] becomes a [[bijection]] which [[permutation|permutes]] true and false. Conjunction and disjunction are [[Dual (mathematics)#Duality in logic and set theory|dual]] with respect to negation, which is expressed by [[De Morgan's laws]]:
: ¬({{math|{{mvar|p}}∧{{mvar|q}}) ⇔ ¬{{mvar|p}} ∨ ¬{{mvar|q}}}}
: ¬({{math|{{mvar|p}}∨{{mvar|q}}) ⇔ ¬{{mvar|p}} ∧ ¬{{mvar|q}}}}

[[Propositional variable]]s become [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] in the Boolean domain. Assigning values for propositional variables is referred to as [[valuation (logic)|valuation]].
&lt;!-- Also something should be written about first-order logics --&gt;

== Intuitionistic and constructive logic ==
{{main|Constructivism (mathematics)}}
In [[intuitionistic logic]], and more generally, [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]], statements are assigned a truth value only if they can be given a constructive proof. It starts with a set of axioms, and a statement is true if one can build a proof of the statement from those axioms. A statement is false if one can deduce a contradiction from it. This leaves open the possibility of statements that have not yet been assigned a truth value.
Unproven statements in intuitionistic logic are not given an intermediate truth value (as is sometimes mistakenly asserted). Indeed, one can prove that they have no third truth value, a result dating back to Glivenko in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionistic-logic-development/#4.3 Proof that intuitionistic logic has no third truth value, Glivenko 1928]&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, statements simply remain of unknown truth value, until they are either proven or disproven.

There are various ways of interpreting intuitionistic logic, including the [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]]. See also [[Intuitionistic logic#Semantics]].

== Multi-valued logic ==
[[Multi-valued logic]]s (such as [[fuzzy logic]] and [[relevance logic]]) allow for more than two truth values, possibly containing some internal structure. For example, on the [[unit interval]] {{closed-closed|0,1}} such structure is a [[total order]]; this may be expressed as the existence of various [[degrees of truth]].

== Algebraic semantics ==
{{main|Algebraic logic}}
Not all [[logical system]]s are truth-valuational in the sense that logical connectives may be interpreted as truth functions. For example, [[intuitionistic logic]] lacks a complete set of truth values because its semantics, the [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]], is specified in terms of [[proof theory|provability]] conditions, and not directly in terms of the [[necessarily true|necessary truth]] of formulae.

But even non-truth-valuational logics can associate values with logical formulae, as is done in [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]]&lt;!-- if this becomes a dab page linking to [[Algebraic logic]], just remove the link --&gt;. The algebraic semantics of intuitionistic logic is given in terms of [[Heyting algebra]]s, compared to [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] semantics of classical propositional calculus.
&lt;!-- This also has an analogy to vector spaces instead of scalars. But is it encyclopedic enough? --&gt;

== In other theories ==
[[Intuitionistic type theory]] uses [[Type theory|types]] in the place of truth values.

[[Topos]] theory uses truth values in a special sense: the truth values of a topos are the [[global element]]s of the [[subobject classifier]].  Having truth values in this sense does not make a logic truth valuational.

The '''Albany''' '''Tulip Queen and Court''' is a symbolic monarchy with a yearly coronation at the [[Albany, NY's Tulip Festival|Tulip Festival]], which takes place in May at [[Washington Park (Albany, New York)|Washington Park]] in [[Albany, New York]] annually.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.albany.com/broadcast/2009/04/29/tulip-queen-finalists/&lt;/ref&gt; The Tulip Queen and her court serve as ambassadors of the city and engage in [[community service]] projects during their one-year term.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.albanytulipqueen.com/. Retrieved August 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Tulip Queen is selected through a process involving letters of recommendation and [[interview]]s by a selection committee. Women aged 18 to 24 are eligible for nomination. The selection of the Tulip Queen began as a beauty pageant, but for many years now the Queen and her court have been selected solely based on their community awareness, history of serving the community, and dedication to Albany. Along with the queen, four court members are selected to work throughout the City of Albany during the year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albanytulipqueen.com/nominate/selection_process.php Albany Tulip Queen: The Selection Process]. Retrieved August 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;. Each year the Queen and her court select a literacy project to implement in the City of Albany. 

The crowning of the Tulip Queen starts with a short processional.  First come the police, then the Albany Police Band playing [[bagpipes]] and drums, then a car containing last year's Tulip Queen and the current [[Mayor of Albany, New York|mayor]].  Next come a series of five cars each containing the five Tulip Queen finalists. After the processional, the mayor, each finalist, and few other people give speeches.  The mayor reads a note that says who has won the Tulip Queen title.  Finally, last year's Tulip Queen takes off her crown and puts it on the head of the new queen. The four finalist not crowned then become the court members. The Tulip Queen and her court serve their year of service until the next Tulip Festival takes place and a new queen is crowned.

The Albany Tulip Queen and Court are an asset to the city of  Albany contributing thousands of hours each year in volunteer service.

'''Universal jurisdiction''' allows [[Sovereign state|state]]s or [[international organization]]s to claim criminal [[jurisdiction]] over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed, and regardless of the accused's nationality, country of [[Residency (domicile)|residence]], or any other relation with the prosecuting entity. Crimes prosecuted under universal jurisdiction are considered crimes against all, too serious to tolerate [[jurisdictional arbitrage]]. &lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;

The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that some international norms are ''[[erga omnes]]'', or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of ''[[jus cogens]]'' – that certain international law obligations are binding on all states.&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lyal S. Sunga]] Individual Responsibility in International Law for Serious Human Rights Violations, Nijhoff (1992) 252 p. {{ISBN|978-0-7923-1453-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], a proponent of universal jurisdiction, certain crimes pose so serious a threat to the international community as a whole that states have a logical and moral duty to prosecute an individual responsible; therefore, no place should be a safe haven for those who have committed [[genocide]],&lt;ref&gt;The Program for Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research, "Brief Primer on Genocide" Accessed at {{cite web|url=http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction%3Dpage.viewpage%26pageid%3D1638 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619091806/http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=1638 |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]], [[extrajudicial execution]]s, [[war crime]]s, [[torture]] and [[forced disappearance]]s.&lt;ref name="AI-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/020/2001/en/|title=UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION: Questions and answers|access-date=6 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:381px-Grotius de jure 1631.jpg|thumb|Title page from the second edition (Amsterdam 1631) of ''De jure belli ac pacis''. First published in 1625, Grotius advances a system of principles of [[natural law]], which are held to be binding on all people and nations regardless of local custom.]]

The ''[[Institutes of Justinian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Institutes of Justinian'', Book I, Title II, "Concerning Natural Law, the Law of Nations, and the Civil Law".&lt;/ref&gt; echoing the ''Commentaries'' of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]],&lt;ref&gt;Gaius. ''Commentaries on the Roman Law'', Book I, Chapter I, "De Jure Gentium et Civili".&lt;/ref&gt; says that "All nations ... are governed partly by their own particular laws, and partly by those laws which are common to all, [those that] natural Reason appoints for all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Maine| first =Sir Henry Sumner| title =Ancient Law: Its Connection With the Early History of Society and Relation to Modern Ideas| publisher =John Murray| publication-place = London | edition = 1861 first| date =| page = 46| language = | isbn =| url = https://archive.org/stream/ancientlawitsco18maingoog#page/n58/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on the classical understanding of universal law accessible by reason, in the seventeenth century, the Dutch jurist [[Grotius]] laid the foundations for universal jurisdiction in modern international law, promulgating in his ''De Jure Pradae'' (''Of the Law of Captures'') and later ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (''Of the Law of War and Peace'') the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view that there are universal principles of right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grotius|authorlink=Grotius |title=[[De Jure Pradae (book)|De Jure Pradæ: (Of the Law of Captures)]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=London |year=1604 |pages=xviii |isbn=}} (discussing in introductory notes Grotius' account of universal principles of right and wrong derived from reason and divine Will, the underpinning of much modern international law).&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, international law came to recognize the analogous concept of ''[[hostes humani generis]]'' ("enemies of the human race"): pirates, hijackers, and similar outlaws whose crimes were typically committed outside the territory of any state. The notion that heads of state and senior public officials should be treated like pirates or outlaws before the global bar of justice is, according to Henry Kissinger, a new gloss on this old concept.&lt;ref name=HK-2001/&gt; From these premises, representing the Enlightenment belief in trans-territorial, trans-cultural standards of right and wrong, derives universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Anthony Pagden|title=The Enlightenment, and Why It Still Matters |year=2013 |publisher=Random House |quote= [I]f there does exist some concept of universal justice, if even the most powerful states on occasion feel compelled to abide by the demands of international law, that we owe to the Enlightenment. | url= |isbn=978-1-4000-6068-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notable and influential precedent for universal jurisdiction were the mid-20th century [[Nuremberg Trials]]. U.S. Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] then chief prosecutor, famously stated that an [[International Military Tribunal]] enforcing universal principles of right and wrong could prosecute acts without a particular geographic location, Nazi "crimes against the peace of the world"—even if the acts were perfectly legal at the time in Fascist Germany. Indeed, one charge was Nazi law itself became a crime, law distorted into a bludgeon of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/jackson.html |title=Justice Jackson's Opening statement for the Prosecution |author=Jackson, Robert, U.S. Supreme Court Justice  |date=21 November 1945 |work= Proceedings, Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal|publisher=International Military Tribunal |accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nuremberg trials supposed universal standards by which one nation's laws, and acts of its officials, can be judged; an international rule of law unbound by national borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jack Goldsmith |title=The Shadow of Nuremberg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/justice-and-the-enemy-nuremberg-9-11-and-the-trial-of-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-by-william-shawcross-book-review.html |quote=The compromises of 1945 came to be seen as imperfect but essential progress toward international rule of law and the foundation for modern international criminal tribunals. |work=[[New York Times]] |date= January 20, 2012|accessdate=2016-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, even at the time the Nuremberg trials appeared to be victor's justice, revenge papered over with legal simulcra. US Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Harlan F. Stone|Harlan Fiske Stone]] remarked that his colleague Justice Jackson acting as Nuremberg Chief prosecutor was "conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg. I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Alpheus T. Mason, Harlan Fiske Stone: Pillar of the Law (New York: Viking, 1956), p. 716.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Roth]], the executive director of [[Human Rights Watch]], argues that universal jurisdiction allowed Israel to try [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Jerusalem in 1961. Roth also argues that clauses in treaties such as the [[Geneva Convention]]s of 1949 and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] of 1984, which requires signatory states to pass [[municipal law]]s that are based on the concept of universal jurisdiction, indicate widespread international acceptance of the concept.&lt;ref name=KR-2001/&gt;

==Universal distinct from extraterritorial jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction differs from a state's prosecuting crimes under its own laws, whether on its own territory ([[territorial jurisdiction]]) or  abroad ([[extraterritorial jurisdiction]]). As an example, the United States asserts jurisdiction over stateless vessels carrying illicit drugs on international waters—but here the US reaches across national borders to enforce its own law, rather than invoking universal jurisdiction and trans-national standards of right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Neil Boister |title=An Introduction to Transnational Criminal Law |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=   | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kElWbHK0JF8C&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=us+transnational+criminal+jurisdiction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ohc-p-b-Tm&amp;sig=BSde-49gTF84cpZEEwvpzCvEX5U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzt_XlsjLAhWHVh4KHYfrDyAQ6AEIZzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=us%20transnational%20criminal%20jurisdiction&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-19-960538-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

States attempting to police acts committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory tends to be more controversial than a state prosecuting its own citizens wherever they may be found. Bases on which a state might exercise jurisdiction in this way include the following:

*The least controversial basis is that under which a state can exercise jurisdiction over acts that affect the fundamental interests of the state, such as [[espionage|spying]], even if the act was committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory. For example, the Indian [[Information Technology Act 2000]] largely supports the extraterritoriality of the said Act. The law states that a contravention of the Act that affects any computer or computer network situated in India will be punishable by India irrespective of the culprit's location and nationality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;
*Also relatively non-controversial is the ability of a state to try its own nationals for crimes committed abroad. France and some other nations will refuse to [[extradition|extradite]] their own citizens as a matter of law, but will instead try them on their own territory for crimes committed abroad.
*More controversial is the exercise of jurisdiction where the victim of the crime is a national of the state exercising jurisdiction. In the past some states have claimed this jurisdiction (e.g., Mexico, ''Cutting Case'' (1887)), while others have been strongly opposed to it (e.g., the United States, except in cases in which an American citizen is a victim: ''US v Yunis'' (1988)). In more recent years, however, a broad global consensus has emerged in permitting its use in the case of torture, "forced disappearances" or terrorist offences (due in part to it being permitted by the various United Nations conventions on terrorism); but its application in other areas is still highly controversial. For example, former dictator of Chile [[Augusto Pinochet]] was arrested in London in 1998, on Spanish judge [[Baltazar Garzon]]'s demand, on charges of human rights abuses, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction but rather on the grounds that some of the victims of the abuses committed in Chile were Spanish citizens. Spain then sought his [[extradition]] from Britain, again, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction, but by invoking the law of the [[European Union]] regarding extradition; and he was finally released on grounds of health. Argentinian [[Alfredo Astiz]]'s sentence is part of this juridical frame.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph and specifically for the quote--&gt;

==International tribunals invoking universal jurisdiction==
[[File:ICC member states world map.png|thumb|States parties to the Statute of the [[International Criminal Court]] (light green means ratification or accession deposited but not yet in force, brown means signed but not yet ratified).]]
Established in [[The Hague]] in 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is an international tribunal of general jurisdiction (defined by treaty) to prosecute state-members' citizens for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, as specified by several international agreements, most prominently the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] signed in 1998.  Universal jurisdiction over the crimes enumerated in the Rome Statute was rejected by the signing parties, however universal jurisdiction is what allows the United Nations Security Council to refer specific situations to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1317&amp;context=bjil&lt;/ref&gt;  This has only happened with Darfur (2005) and Libya (2011).

In addition the United Nations has set up geographically specific courts to investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity under a theory of universal jurisdiction, such as the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (1994), and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (1993).

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia investigates war crimes that took place in the Balkans in the 1990s.  It convicted former Bosnian Serb leader [[Radovan Karadžić]] on 10 charges relating to directing murders, purges and other abuses against civilians, including genocide in connection with the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica; he was sentenced to 40 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brian Murphy  |title=U.N. tribunal finds former Bosnia Serb leader guilty of genocide |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/un-tribunal-finds-former-bosnia-serb-leader-guilty-of-genocide/2016/03/24/1a9f1066-f1c9-11e5-85a6-2132cf446d0a_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_karadzic_11am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory |quote= |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=March 24, 2016 |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular states invoking universal jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction may be asserted by a particular nation as well as by an international tribunal. The result is the same: individuals become answerable for crimes defined and prosecuted regardless of where they live, or where the conduct occurred; crimes said to be so grievous as to be universally condemned.

Amnesty International argues that since the end of the Second World War over fifteen states have conducted investigations, commenced prosecutions and completed trials based on universal jurisdiction for the crimes or arrested people with a view to extraditing the persons to a state seeking to prosecute them. These states include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, [[Israel]], Mexico, Netherlands, [[Senegal]], Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref name="AI-FAQ"/&gt;  Amnesty writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt; All states parties to the [[UN Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]] and the [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture|Inter-American Convention]] are obliged whenever a person suspected of torture is found in their territory to submit the case to their prosecuting authorities for the purposes of prosecution, or to extradite that person. In addition, it is now widely recognized that states, even those that are not states parties to these treaties, may exercise universal jurisdiction over torture under customary international law.&lt;ref name=AI-UJ&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/012/2001/en/?OpenDocument Universal Jurisdiction: The duty of states to enact and implement legislation – Chapter Nine (Torture: The legal basis for universal jurisdiction)], [[Amnesty International]] 1 September 2001. Section II. Universal Jurisdiction over torture &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples of particular states invoking universal jurisdiction are Israel's prosecution of Eichmann in 1961 (see {{section link||Israel}} below) and Spain's prosecution of South American dictators and torturers (see {{section link||Spain}} below).  More recently, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] tried first in Switzerland and then in Canada to prosecute former US President [[George W. Bush]] on behalf of persons tortured in US detention camps, invoking the universal jurisdiction doctrine. Bush cancelled his trip to Switzerland after news of the planned prosecution came to light. Bush has traveled to Canada but the Canadian government shut down the prosecution in advance of his arrest.&lt;ref name = "Center Prosecution"&gt;{{cite news |author=Matt Eisenbrandt |author2=Katherine Gallagher |title=Halting Canadian Bush Prosecution Violated International Obligations|url=http://jurist.org/hotline/2012/01/eisenbrandt-gallagher-bush.php |work=[[Jurist]] | quote=Canada disregarded an opportunity to shatter the global impunity Bush enjoys and in so doing violated international law. |date=January 17, 2012  |accessdate=2016-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center has filed a grievance with the United Nations for Canada's failure to invoke universal jurisdiction to enforce the [[Convention Against Torture]], a petition on which action is pending.&lt;ref name = "Center Prosecution"/&gt;

==Immunity for state officials==
On 14 February 2002, the International Court of Justice in the [[Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)|''ICJ Arrest Warrant Case'']] concluded that state officials may have immunity under international law while serving in office. The court stated that immunity was not granted to state officials for their own benefit, but instead to ensure the effective performance of their functions on behalf of their respective states. The court also stated that when abroad, state officials may enjoy immunity from arrest in another state on criminal charges, including charges of war crimes or crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name=ICJ-PR-020214&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2002/afr379.html|title=ICJ rejects Belgian arrest warrant for foreign ministers of Democratic Republic of Congo|publisher=United Nations Information Service|date=14 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the ICJ qualified its conclusions, saying that state officers "may be subject to criminal proceedings before certain international criminal courts, where they have jurisdiction. Examples include the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda&amp;nbsp;..., and the future International Criminal Court."&lt;ref name=CRAN-2003-fn6&gt;Cesare P.R. Romano and André Nollkaemper. ''[http://www.asil.org/insights/insigh110.htm#_ednref6 The Arrest Warrant Against The Liberian President, Charles Taylor]'', on the website of the [[American Society of International Law]], June 2003. Cites in footnote 6: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium), Judgment, Merits, para. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]], the former president of [[Liberia]], was served with an arrest warrant by the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] (SCSL) that was set up under the auspices of a treaty that binds only the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=CRAN-2003&gt;Cesare P.R. Romano and André Nollkaemper. ''[http://www.asil.org/insights/insigh110.htm The Arrest Warrant Against The Liberian President, Charles Taylor]'', on the website of the [[American Society of International Law]], June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor contested the Special Court's jurisdiction, claiming immunity, but the Special Court for Sierra Leone concluded in 2004 that "the sovereign equality of states does not prevent a head of state from being prosecuted before an international criminal tribunal or court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/ProsecutorvsCharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspx&lt; |title=Prosecutor v.

David |lastauthoramp=yes |date=31 May 2004 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, the question whether a former head of state might have immunity depends on which international court or tribunal endeavors to try him, how the court is constituted, and how it interprets its own mandate.

===Australia===

The High Court of Australia confirmed the authority of the Australian Parliament, under the Australian Constitution, to exercise universal jurisdiction over war crimes in the ''[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]]'' case of 1991.

===Belgium===
In 1993, Belgium's Parliament passed a "law of universal jurisdiction" (sometimes referred to as "Belgium's genocide law"), allowing it to judge people accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. In 2001, four Rwandan citizens were convicted and given sentences from 12 to 20 years' imprisonment for their involvement in 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/french/press/2003/justice02.htm |title=Belgique : Questions et Réponses sur la loi de Compétence Universelle |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a rapid succession of cases:
*Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] was accused of involvement in the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] in Lebanon, conducted by a Christian militia;
*Israelis filed a case against [[Yasser Arafat]] on grounds of responsibility for terrorist activity;
*In 2003, Iraqi victims of a [[Gulf War|1991 Bagdad bombing]] pressed charges against [[George Herbert Walker Bush|George H.W. Bush]], [[Colin Powell]] and [[Dick Cheney]].

Confronted with this sharp increase in cases, Belgium established the condition that the accused person must be Belgian or present in Belgium. An arrest warrant issued in 2000 under this law, against the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was challenged before the [[International Court of Justice]] in the case entitled ''[[Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)|ICJ Arrest Warrant Case]]''. The ICJ's decision issued on 14 February 2002 found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the question of universal jurisdiction, instead deciding the question on the basis of immunity of high-ranking state officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061002112703/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/icobejudgment/icobe_ijudgment_20020214.PDF ICJ's decision] See paragraph 43&lt;/ref&gt; However, the matter was addressed in separate and dissenting opinions,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313044438/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/iCOBEframe.htm separate and dissenting opinions]&lt;/ref&gt; such as that of President Guillaume who concluded that universal jurisdiction exists only in relation to piracy;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/121/8128.pdf separate opinion of President Guillaume] at paragraph 12&lt;/ref&gt; and the dissenting opinion of Judge Oda who recognised piracy, hijacking, terrorism and genocide as crimes subject to universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020312003750/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/icobejudgment/icobe_ijudgment_20020214_oda.PDF dissenting opinion of Judge Oda], paragraph 12&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2003, Belgium repealed the law on universal jurisdiction, and introduced a new law on [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] similar to or more restrictive than that of most other European countries. However, some cases that had already started continued. These included those concerning the Rwandan genocide, and complaints filed against the Chadian ex-President [[Hissène Habré]] (dubbed the "African [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/press/2003/08/belgium080103.htm|title=Belgium: Universal Jurisdiction Law Repealed|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=1 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2005, Habré was indicted for crimes against humanity, torture, war crimes and other human rights violations by a Belgian court. Arrested in [[Senegal]] following requests from Senegalese courts, he was tried and convicted for war crimes by the Special Tribunal in Senegal in 2016 and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trial-ch.org/fr/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/hissene_habre_87.html Trial Watch : Hissène Habré] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413081352/http://www.trial-ch.org/fr/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/hissene_habre_87.html |date=13 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

To implement the Rome Statute, Canada passed the [[Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act]]. [[Michael Byers (Canadian author)|Michael Byers]], a [[University of British Columbia]] law professor, has argued that these laws go further than the Rome Statute, providing Canadian courts with jurisdiction over acts pre-dating the ICC and occurring in territories outside of ICC member-states; "as a result, anyone who is present in Canada and alleged to have committed genocide, torture ... anywhere, at any time, can be prosecuted [in Canada]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Byers|title=Intent for a Nation|year=2007 |publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-1-55365-250-2|page=111 |authorlink=Michael Byers (Canadian author)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===

A Finnish high court sentenced a Rwandan preacher to life in jail in 2010 for his participation in Rwanda's genocide in 1994. Francois Bazaramba, 59, moved in 2003 to Finland seeking asylum. Finland allows prosecutions for crimes against humanity wherever they are committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10294529 | work=BBC News | title=Finland sentences Rwanda preacher to life for genocide | date=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the genocide, he was a pastor in the Baptist church in Nyakizu in southern Rwanda. According to Finnish newspaper ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', the court found him guilty of orchestrating deadly attacks, and organising the torching of Tutsi homes. In a statement the court said he had spread anti-Tutsi propaganda and incited "killings through fomenting anger and contempt towards Tutsis". It stated that "The court has found Bazaramba guilty of an offence which without a genocidal intent would be judged as a murder or incitement to murder ... For those crimes, the only possible punishment is life imprisonment." ''Helsingin Sanomat'' reported that he was acquitted of 10 counts of murder and of providing training and acquiring weapons. During the trial, the court heard from 68 witnesses, travelling to Rwanda and Tanzania to hear some testimonies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The following infractions may be prosecuted:
* Torture
* Terrorism
* Nuclear smuggling
* Naval piracy
* Airplane hijacking

===Germany===
{{Main|Völkerstrafgesetzbuch}}

Germany has implemented the principle of universal jurisdiction for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes into its criminal law through the "'''''Völkerstrafgesetzbuch"''''' or '''''VStGB''''' ("international criminal code", literally "book of the criminal law of peoples"), which implemented the treaty creating the [[International Criminal Court]] into domestic law. The law was passed in 2002 and up to 2014 it has been used once, in the trial of [[Rwanda]]n rebel leader [[Ignace Murwanashyaka]]. In 2015 he was found guilty and sentenced to 13 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://armedgroups-internationallaw.org/2015/09/28/conviction-of-fdlr-leaders-by-german-court/ | title=Conviction of FDLR leaders by German Court | work= Armed Groups and International Law | date=28 September 2015 | accessdate=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/us-tells-armed-group-drc-surrender-military-option|title = US tells armed group in DRC to surrender or face 'military option'|date = 5 Aug 2014|work = |accessdate = 19 Nov 2014|publisher = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===

{{Main|Adolf Eichmann}}
The [[moral philosophy|moral philosopher]] [[Peter Singer]], along with Kenneth Roth,&lt;ref name=KR-2001/&gt; has cited [[Israel]]'s prosecution of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1961 as an assertion of universal jurisdiction. He claims that while Israel did invoke a statute specific to [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] crimes against Jews, its [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] claimed universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |title=One World |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=114 |isbn=0-300-09686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eichmann's defense lawyer argued that Israel did not have jurisdiction on account of Israel not having come into existence until 1948. The Genocide Convention also did not come into effect until 1951, and the Genocide Convention does not automatically provide for universal jurisdiction. It is also argued that Israeli agents obtained Eichmann illegally, violating international law when they seized and kidnapped Eichmann, and brought him to Israel to stand trial. The Argentinian government settled the dispute diplomatically with Israel.&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Attorney General of Israel v. Eichmann |vol=Criminal Case 40/61 |reporter= |court=District Court of Jerusalem |date=1961 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ }} {{citation|title=Transcripts |accessdate=6 February 2013 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |  archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061001235018/http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |archivedate = 1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel argued universal jurisdiction based on the "universal character of the crimes in question" and that the crimes committed by Eichmann were not only in violation of Israel law, but were considered "grave offenses against the law of nations itself".&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt; It also asserted that the crime of genocide is covered under international customary law. As a supplemental form of jurisdiction, a further argument is made on the basis of protective jurisdiction. Protective jurisdiction is a principle that "provides that states may exercise jurisdiction over aliens who have committed an act abroad which is deemed prejudicial to the security of the particular state concerned".&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt;

===Senegal===

In July 2015, the first trial in Africa of a universal jurisdiction case relating to crimes committed abroad by a foreigner with foreign victims was held in a Senegalese courtroom. The former dictator of [[Chad]], [[Hissène Habré]], denied the legitimacy of the special court set up to try him in Senegal for the deaths of thousands during his rule, but the head of the tribunal, [[Gberdao Gustave Kam]], said he would be compelled to participate.  Mr. Habré's lawyers said he was forced to attend the first day of his trial for crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture. The case was lauded by [[Human Rights Watch]]. It was also the first time the courts of one country are prosecuting the former ruler of another for alleged human rights crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ex-dictator-of-chad-denies-legitimacy-of-torture-crimes-trial-in-senegal/article25599568/ theglobeandmail.com: "Ex-dictator of Chad denies legitimacy of torture crimes trial in Senegal"], 20 Jul 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

Spanish law recognizes the principle of universal jurisdiction. Article 23.4 of the Judicial Power Organization Act (LOPJ), enacted on 1 July 1985, establishes that Spanish courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by Spaniards or foreign citizens outside Spain when such crimes can be described according to Spanish criminal law as genocide, terrorism, or some other, as well as any other crime that, according to international treaties or conventions, must be prosecuted in Spain. On 25 July 2009, the Spanish Congress passed a law that limits the competence of the [[Audiencia Nacional of Spain|Audiencia Nacional]] under Article 23.4 to cases in which Spaniards are victims, there is a relevant link to Spain, or the alleged perpetrators are in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain reins in crusading judges |publisher=BBC News | date=25 June 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8119920.stm |first=Steve |last=Kingstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law still has to pass the Senate, the high chamber, but passage is expected because it is supported by both major parties.&lt;ref name="The Associated Press"&gt;{{cite news | title=Spanish court ends Israel bombing probe | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g7nVX6JkK9c3ofnkBpgD_5eFF84AD9950VPO0 | agency=Associated Press | date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six officials, among them [[Efraín Ríos Montt]] and [[Óscar Humberto Mejía]], were formally charged on 7 July 2006 to appear in the Spanish National Court after Spain's Constitutional Court ruled in September 2005, the Spanish Constitutional Court declaration that the "principle of universal jurisdiction prevails over the existence of national interests", following the Menchu suit brought against the officials for atrocities committed in the [[Guatemalan Civil War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/07/spain-judge-charges-ex-generals-in.php|title=Spain judge charges ex-generals in Guatemala genocide case|publisher=Jurist|date=8 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Spanish Supreme Court: Guatemala Genocide Case | publisher=Nizkor Project | date=25 February 2003 | url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/guatemala/doc/stsgtm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003, Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] jailed [[Ricardo Miguel Cavallo]], a former [[Argentina|Argentine]] naval officer, who was extradited from Mexico to Spain pending his trial on charges of genocide and terrorism relating to the years of Argentina's military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20A13FD3F5E0C738FDDAF0894DB404482|title=Spanish Judge Sends Argentine to Prison on Genocide Charge|first=Emma|last=Daly|work=The New York Times|date=30 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3085482.stm|title=Profile: Judge Baltasar Garzon|publisher=BBC|date=36 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2006, the [[Audiencia Nacional|Spanish High Court]] agreed to investigate a case in which seven former Chinese officials, including the former [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party General Secretary]] [[Jiang Zemin]] and former [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Li Peng]] were alleged to have participated in a genocide in [[Tibet]].

In December 2009 a court in London issued an arrest warrant for [[Tzipi Livni]]  in connection with accusations of [[war crimes]] in the Gaza Strip during [[Operation Cast Lead]] (2008–2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/14/tzipi-livni-israel-gaza-arrest |work=The Guardian | location=London | title=British court issued Gaza arrest warrant for former Israeli minister Tzipi Livni | first=Ian | last=Black | date=14 December 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrant was issued on 12 December and revoked on 14 December 2009 after it was revealed that Livni had not entered British territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1134978.html |title=Foreign Ministry outraged over U.K. arrest warrant against Livni |newspaper=Haaretz |date=14 December 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrant was later denounced as "cynical" by the Israeli foreign ministry, while Livni's office said she was "proud of all her decisions in Operation Cast Lead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8413234.stm |publisher=BBC News | title = Israel condemns attempt in a UK court to arrest Livni|date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livni herself called the arrest warrant "an abuse of the British legal system".&lt;ref name="UK warrant"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8415123.stm |date=14 December 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=14 December 2009 |title=Tzipi Livni: UK warrant a legal 'abuse'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly a January visit to Britain by a team of [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) was cancelled over concerns that arrest warrants would be sought by pro-Palestinian advocates in connection with allegations of [[war crimes]] under laws of universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/14/tzipi-livni-israel-gaza-arrest| title= Israeli military cancels UK visit over arrest fears |work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Ian | last=Black | date=14 December 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
While the United States has no formal statute authorizing it, in some cases the Federal government has exercised [[self-help (law)|self-help]] in apprehending or killing persons suspected of conspiring to commit crimes within the United States from outside of the country, or committing crimes against U.S officials outside of the United States. This has occurred even when the suspect is not a U.S. person, has never been in the United States, and even when the person has never conspired or assisted in the commission of a crime within the United States, there is a functioning government which could try the person for the crime committed there, and notwithstanding the existence of a proper extradition treaty between that country and the United States, ignoring the provisions of the treaty and capturing or killing the person directly.

In 1985, Dr. Humberto Alvarez-Machain, a [[Mexico|Mexican]] national, allegedly assisted in the torture and murder of a U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent in Mexico. Notwithstanding that the U.S had an extradition treaty with Mexico (and because the Mexican government declined to extradite a Mexican national to the U.S. for a crime allegedly committed in Mexico), the U.S. Government hired a private citizen and some Mexican nationals to essentially act as mercenaries, who then went into Mexico, kidnapped Dr. Alvarez-Machain, and brought him back to the U.S. for trial for the crime committed in Mexico. The trial court ruled that since Alvarez-Machain had been brought to the U.S. in violation of the treaty, his arrest was unlawful. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], in ''[[United States v. Alvarez-Machain]]'', ruled that notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty with Mexico, it was still legal for the U.S. government to exercise self-help and essentially grab him off the street in Mexico ("forcible abduction") to bring him back to the U.S. for trial. In Alvarez-Machain's subsequent criminal trial, he was acquitted, and he lost a civil suit he filed for false arrest against the government.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer programming]], a '''variable''' or '''scalar''' is a storage location (identified by a [[Memory address|memory address]]) paired with an associated [[symbol|symbolic name]] (an ''[[Identifier (computer programming)|identifier]]''), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a ''[[value (computer science)|value]]''. The variable name is the usual way to [[Reference (computer science)|reference]] the stored value, in addition to referring to the variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer [[source code]] can be [[Name binding|bound]] to a [[Value (computer science)|value]] during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of [[Execution (computing)|program execution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=[[Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools]] | pages=26-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knuth |first=Donald |date=1997 |title=The Art of Computer Programming |volume=1 |edition=3rd |location=Reading, Massachusetts |publisher=Addison-Wesley |page=3-4 |isbn=0-201-89683-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variables in programming may not directly correspond to the concept of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables in mathematics]]. The latter is [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]], having no reference to a physical object such as storage location. The value of a computing variable is not necessarily part of an [[equation]] or [[formula]] as in mathematics. Variables in computer programming are frequently given long names to make them relatively descriptive of their use, whereas variables in mathematics often have terse, one- or two-character names for brevity in transcription and manipulation.

A variable's storage location may be referred by several different identifiers, a situation known as [[Aliasing_(computing)|aliasing]]. Assigning a value to the variable using one of the identifiers will change the value that can be accessed through the other identifiers.

[[compiler (computing)|Compilers]] have to replace variables' symbolic names with the actual locations of the data. While a variable's name, type, and location often remain fixed, the data stored in the location may be changed during program execution.

==Actions on a variable==
In [[imperative programming|imperative]] [[programming language]]s, values can generally be [[Dereference|accessed]] or [[Assignment (computer science)|changed]] at any time. In [[Pure function|pure]] [[functional programming|functional]] and [[logic programming|logic language]]s, variables are [[Free variables and bound variables|bound]] to expressions and keep a single value during their entire [[Scope (programming)|lifetime]] due to the requirements of [[referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]]. In imperative languages, the same behavior is exhibited by (named) [[constant (programming)|constant]]s (symbolic constants), which are typically contrasted with (normal) variables.

Depending on the [[type system]] of a programming language, variables may only be able to store a specified [[datatype]] (e.g. [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] or [[string (computer science)|string]]). Alternatively, a datatype may be associated only with the current value, allowing a single variable to store anything supported by the programming language.

Variables and scope:-
(A)	Automatic variables: - Each local variable in a function comes into existence only when the function is called, and disappears when the function is exited. Such variables are known as automatic variables. 
(B)	External variables: - These are variables that are external to a function on and can be accessed by name by any function. These variables remain in existence permanently; rather that appearing and disappearing as functions are called and exited, retain their values even after the functions that set them have returned.

==Identifiers referencing a variable==

An identifier referencing a variable can be used to access the variable in order to read out the value, or alter the value, or edit other [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] of the variable, such as access permission, [[Lock (computer science)|locks]], [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], etc.

For instance, a variable might be referenced by the identifier "&lt;code&gt;totalcows&lt;/code&gt;" and the variable can contain the number 1956.  If the same variable is referenced by the identifier "&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;" as well, and if using this identifier "&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;", the value of the variable is altered to 2009, then reading the value using the identifier "&lt;code&gt;total_count&lt;/code&gt;" will yield a result of 2009 and not 1956.

If a variable is only referenced by a single identifier that can simply be called ''the name of the variable''. Otherwise, we can speak of ''one of the names of the variable''.  For instance, in the previous example, the "&lt;code&gt;total cows&lt;/code&gt;" is a name of the variable in question, and "&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;" is another name of the same variable.

== {{Anchor|Scope and extent|SCOPE-AND-EXTENT}}Scope and extent ==
{{See also|Free variables and bound variables}}

The ''[[scope (programming)|scope]]'' of a variable describes where in a program's text the variable may be used, while the ''extent'' (or ''lifetime'') describes when in a program's execution a variable has a (meaningful) value. The scope of a variable is actually a property of the name of the variable, and the extent is a property of the variable itself. These should not be confused with ''context'' (also called ''environment''), which is a property of the program, and varies by point in the source code or execution – see [[Scope (computer science)#Overview|scope: overview]]. Further, [[object lifetime]] may coincide with variable lifetime, but in many cases is not tied to variable lifetime.

A variable name's ''scope'' affects its ''extent''.

''Scope'' is an important part of the [[Name resolution (programming languages)|name resolution]] of a variable. Most languages define a specific ''scope'' for each variable (as well as any other named entity), which may differ within a given program. The scope of a variable is the portion of the program code for which the variable's name has meaning and for which the variable is said to be "visible". Entrance into that scope typically begins a variable's lifetime (as it comes into context) and exit from that scope typically ends its lifetime (as it goes out of context). For instance, a variable with "[[lexical scope]]" is meaningful only within a certain function/[[subroutine]], or more finely within a block of expressions/statements (accordingly with [[function scope]] or [[block scope]]); this is static resolution, performable at parse-time or compile-time. Alternatively, a variable with [[dynamic scope]] is resolved at run-time, based on a global binding stack that depends on the specific control flow. Variables only accessible within a certain functions are termed "[[local variable]]s". A "[[global variable]]", or one with indefinite scope, may be referred to anywhere in the program.

''Extent'', on the other hand, is a runtime ([[Dynamic variable scoping#Dynamic scoping|dynamic]]) aspect of a variable. Each [[name binding|binding]] of a variable to a value can have its own ''extent'' at runtime. The extent of the binding is the portion of the program's execution time during which the variable continues to refer to the same value or memory location. A running program may enter and leave a given extent many times, as in the case of a [[closure (computer science)|closure]].

Unless the programming language features [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], a variable whose extent permanently outlasts its scope can result in a [[memory leak]], whereby the memory allocated for the variable can never be freed since the variable which would be used to reference it for deallocation purposes is no longer accessible. However, it can be permissible for a variable binding to extend beyond its scope, as occurs in Lisp [[closure (computer science)|closures]] and C [[static local variable]]s; when execution passes back into the variable's scope, the variable may once again be used. A variable whose scope begins before its extent does is said to be ''[[uninitialized variable|uninitialized]]'' and often has an undefined, arbitrary value if accessed (see [[wild pointer]]), since it has yet to be explicitly given a particular value. A variable whose extent ends before its scope may become a [[dangling pointer]] and deemed uninitialized once more since its value has been destroyed. Variables described by the previous two cases may be said to be ''out of extent'' or ''unbound''. In many languages, it is an error to try to use the value of a variable when it is out of extent. In other languages, doing so may yield [[undefined behavior|unpredictable results]]. Such a variable may, however, be assigned a new value, which gives it a new extent.

For space efficiency, a memory space needed for a variable may be allocated only when the variable is first used and freed when it is no longer needed. A variable is only needed when it is in scope, thus beginning each variable's lifetime when it enters scope may give space to unused variables. To avoid wasting such space, compilers often warn programmers if a variable is declared but not used.

It is considered good programming practice to make the scope of variables as narrow as feasible so that different parts of a program do not accidentally interact with each other by modifying each other's variables. Doing so also prevents [[action at distance (computer science)|action at a distance]].  Common techniques for doing so are to have different sections of a program use different [[namespace (programming)|name space]]s, or to make individual variables "private" through either [[Dynamic variable scoping#Dynamic scoping|dynamic variable scoping]] or [[Lexical variable scoping#Static scoping|lexical variable scoping]].

Many programming languages employ a reserved value (often named ''[[null pointer|null]]'' or ''nil'') to indicate an invalid or uninitialized variable.

In [[static typing|statically typed]] languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[ML programming language|ML]], a variable also has a ''type'', meaning that only certain kinds of values can be stored in it. For example, a variable of type "[[integer (computer science)|integer]]" is prohibited from storing text values.

In [[dynamic typing|dynamically typed]] languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], it is values, not variables, which carry type. In [[Common Lisp]], both situations exist simultaneously: A variable is given a type (if undeclared, it is assumed to be &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, the universal [[Subtype|supertype]]) which exists at compile time. Values also have types, which can be checked and queried at runtime.

Typing of variables also allows [[type polymorphism|polymorphisms]] to be resolved at compile time. However, this is different from the polymorphism used in object-oriented function calls (referred to as ''[[virtual functions]]'' in [[C++]]) which resolves the call based on the value type as opposed to the supertypes the variable is allowed to have.

Variables often store simple data, like integers and literal strings, but some programming languages allow a variable to store values of other [[datatype]]s as well. Such languages may also enable functions to be [[Parametric polymorphism#Parametric polymorphism|parametric polymorphic]]. These functions operate like variables to represent data of multiple types. For example, a function named &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; may determine the length of a list. Such a &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; function may be parametric polymorphic by including a type variable in its [[type signature]], since the amount of elements in the list is independent of the elements' types.

==Parameters==
The ''formal parameters'' (or ''formal arguments'') of functions are also referred to as variables. For instance, in this [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code segment,

&lt;source lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def addtwo(x):
...     return x + 2
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; addtwo(5)
7
&lt;/source&gt;

the variable named &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a ''[[Parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]'' because it is given a value when the function is called.  The integer 5 is the ''argument'' which gives &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; its value. In most languages, function parameters have local scope. This specific variable named &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; can only be referred to within the &lt;code&gt;addtwo&lt;/code&gt; function (though of course other functions can also have variables called &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;).

==Memory allocation==
The specifics of variable allocation and the representation of their values vary widely, both among programming languages and among implementations of a given language. Many language implementations allocate space for ''[[local variable]]s'', whose extent lasts for a single function call on the ''[[call stack]]'', and whose memory is automatically reclaimed when the function returns. More generally, in ''[[name binding]]'', the name of a variable is bound to the address of some particular block (contiguous sequence) of bytes in memory, and operations on the variable manipulate that block. [[reference (computer science)|Referencing]] is more common for variables whose values have large or unknown sizes when the code is compiled. Such variables reference the location of the value instead of storing the value itself, which is allocated from a pool of memory called the ''[[Dynamic memory allocation#Heap-based memory allocation|heap]]''.

Bound variables have values. A value, however, is an abstraction, an idea; in implementation, a value is represented by some ''[[Object (computer science)|data object]]'', which is stored somewhere in computer memory. The program, or the [[runtime environment]], must set aside memory for each data object and, since memory is finite, ensure that this memory is yielded for reuse when the object is no longer needed to represent some variable's value.

Objects allocated from the heap must be reclaimed&amp;mdash;especially when the objects are no longer needed. In a [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage-collected]] language (such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], Python, Golang and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]), the runtime environment automatically reclaims objects when extant variables can no longer refer to them. In non-garbage-collected languages, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], the program (and the programmer) must explicitly [[malloc|allocate]] memory, and then later free it, to reclaim its memory. Failure to do so leads to [[memory leak]]s, in which the heap is depleted as the program runs, risks eventual failure from exhausting available memory.

When a variable refers to a [[data structure]] created dynamically, some of its components may be only indirectly accessed through the variable. In such circumstances, garbage collectors (or analogous program features in languages that lack garbage collectors) must deal with a case where only a portion of the memory reachable from the variable needs to be reclaimed.

==Naming conventions==
{{Main|Naming conventions (programming)}}
{{See also|Identifier|Namespace}}

Unlike their mathematical counterparts, programming variables and constants commonly take multiple-character names, e.g. &lt;code&gt;COST&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt;. Single-character names are most commonly used only for auxiliary variables; for instance, &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; for [[array index]] variables.

Some naming conventions are enforced at the language level as part of the language syntax which involves the format of valid identifiers. In almost all languages, variable names cannot start with a digit (0–9) and cannot contain whitespace characters. Whether or not punctuation marks are permitted in variable names varies from language to language; many languages only permit the [[underscore]] ("_") in variable names and forbid all other punctuation. In some programming languages, [[sigil (computer programming)|sigil]]s (symbols or punctuation) are affixed to variable identifiers to indicate the variable's datatype or scope.

[[Case-sensitivity]] of variable names also varies between languages and some languages require the use of a certain case in naming certain entities;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] requires that names of types start with a capital letter.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most modern languages are case-sensitive; some older languages are not. Some languages reserve certain forms of variable names for their own internal use; in many languages, names beginning with two underscores ("__") often fall under this category.

However, beyond the basic restrictions imposed by a language, the naming of variables is largely a matter of style. At the [[machine code]] level, variable names are not used, so the exact names chosen do not matter to the computer. Thus names of variables identify them, for the rest they are just a tool for programmers to make programs easier to write and understand. Using poorly chosen variable names can make code more difficult to review than non-descriptive names, so names which are clear are often encouraged.&lt;ref name="Choosing good variable names"&gt;[http://www.dotcadot.ca/articles/how-not-pick-variables How Not To Pick Variables], Retrieved July 11, 2012 [DEAD LINK]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EWD1044"&gt;{{citation | author=[[Edsger Dijkstra]] | title = To hell with “meaningful identifiers”! | url = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1044.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programmers often create and adhere to code style guidelines which offer guidance on naming variables or impose a precise naming scheme. Shorter names are faster to type but are less descriptive; longer names often make programs easier to read and the purpose of variables easier to understand. However, extreme verbosity in variable names can also lead to less comprehensible code.

==Variable types(based on lifetime)==
In terms of the classifications of variables, we can classify variables based on the lifetime of them. The different types of variables are static, stack-dynamic, explicit heap-dynamic, and implicit heap-dynamic. A static variable is also known as global variable, it is bound to a memory cell before execution begins and remains to the same memory cell until termination. A typical example is the static variables in C and C++. A Stack-dynamic variable is known as local variable, which is bound when the declaration statement is executed, and it is deallocated when the procedure returns. The main examples are local variables in C subprograms and Java methods. Explicit Heap-Dynamic variables are nameless (abstract) memory cells that are allocated and deallocated by explicit run-time instructions specified by the programmer. The main examples are dynamic objects in C++ (via new and delete) and all objects in Java. Implicit Heap-Dynamic variables are bound to heap storage only when they are assigned values. Allocation and release occur when values are reassigned to variables. As a result, Implicit heap-dynamic variables have the highest degree of flexibility. The main examples are some variables in JavaScript, PHP and all variables in APL.

'''Violence against women''' ('''VAW'''), also known as '''gender-based violence'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Russo | first1 = Nancy Felipe | last2 = Pirlott | first2 = Angela | title = Gender-based violence: concepts, methods, and findings | journal = [[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |issue=Violence and Exploitation Against Women and Girls | volume = 1087 | pages = 178&amp;ndash;205 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] and [[Oxfam]] | doi = 10.1196/annals.1385.024 | date = November 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1385.024 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''sexual and gender-based violence''' ('''SGBV''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/SGBV/en/ Sexual and Gender-based Violence] (WHO)&lt;/ref&gt; is, collectively, violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against [[woman|women]] and girls.

The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] states, "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women" and "violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm |title=A/RES/48/104 - Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kofi Annan]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], declared in a 2006 report posted on the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) website:&lt;blockquote&gt;Violence against women and girls is a problem of [[pandemic]] proportions. At least one out of every three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime with the abuser usually someone known to her.&lt;ref name="Moradian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.tolerancy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=176:2009-09-15-08-37-55&amp;catid=43:events-a-reports&amp;Itemid=90 |title=Domestic Violence against Single and Married Women in Iranian Society |last=Moradian |first=Azad |work=Tolerancy.org |publisher=[[The Chicago School of Professional Psychology]] |date=10 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425230632/http://en.tolerancy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=176%3A2009-09-15-08-37-55&amp;catid=43%3Aevents-a-reports&amp;Itemid=90 |archivedate=25 April 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Violence against women can fit into several broad categories. These include violence carried out by "individuals" as well as "states". Some of the forms of violence perpetrated by individuals are: [[rape]], [[domestic violence]], [[sexual harassment]], [[reproductive coercion]], [[female infanticide]], [[sex selective abortion|prenatal sex selection]], [[obstetric violence]], and [[mob violence]]; as well as harmful customary or traditional practices such as [[honor killings]], [[dowry death|dowry violence]], [[female genital mutilation]], [[marriage by abduction]] and [[forced marriage]]. Some forms of violence are perpetrated or condoned by the state such as [[war rape]]; [[sexual violence]] and [[sexual slavery]] during conflict; [[forced sterilization]]; [[forced abortion]]; violence by the police and authoritative personnel; [[stoning]] and [[flogging]]. Many forms of VAW, such as [[trafficking in women]] and [[forced prostitution]] are often perpetrated by organized criminal networks.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. 2013"&gt;{{cite book | last = Prügl | first = Elisabeth (Director) | title = Violence Against Women. Gender and International Affairs Class 2013. Lecture conducted from [[The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] (IHEID) | location = Geneva, Switzerland | date = 25 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), in its research on VAW, has analyzed and categorized the different forms of VAW occurring through all stages of life from before birth to old age.&lt;ref name="WHO_VAW"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Violence against women: Definition and scope of the problem, 1, 1-3 | url = http://www.who.int/gender/violence/v4.pdf | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | date = July 1997 | access-date = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been a trend of approaching VAW at an international level, through instruments such as conventions; or, in the [[European Union]], through [[Directive (European Union)|directive]]s, such as the directive against [[sexual harassment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Directive 2002/73/EC - equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF |format=pdf | date = September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the directive against [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF |format=pdf |title= Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JH |work=Official Journal of the European Union |accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, provides the following definition of violence against women:&lt;ref name="COE 210"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/210 |title=Details of Treaty No.210: Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence |publisher=Council of Europe |date= |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|"violence against women" is understood as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women and shall mean all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life}}

Although the 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) includes VAW in its General Recommendations 12 and 19,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/ |title=General recommendations adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |publisher=United Nations |date=31 December 2003 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] mentions VAW at paragraph 18,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=12 July 1993 |url=http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=topic&amp;tocid=459d17822&amp;toid=459b17a82&amp;docid=3ae6b39ec&amp;skip=O |title=Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action |publisher=UN General Assembly |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the 1993 [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution on the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]], which became the first international instrument to explicitly define VAW and elaborate on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/global-norms-and-standards |title=What We Do: Ending Violence against Women: Global Norms and Standards |publisher=UN Women |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions of VAW are provided by the 1994 ''Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html |title=Inter-American Convention On The Prevention, Punishment And Eradication Of Violence Against Women "Convention Of Belem Do Para" |publisher=Organization of American States |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 2003 [[Maputo Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/files/instruments/women-protocol/achpr_instr_proto_women_eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa |publisher=African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the term ''gender-based violence'' refers to "any acts or threats of acts intended to hurt or make women suffer physically, sexually or psychologically, and which affect women because they are women or affect women disproportionately".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Richters | first = J.M. Annemiek | title = Women, culture and violence: a development, health and human rights issue | publisher = Women and Autonomy Centre (VENA), Leiden University | location = Leiden, The Netherlands | year = 1994 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KvbtAAAAMAAJ | oclc = 905570045 | isbn = 9789072631374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of gender-based violence is most often "used interchangeably with violence against women",&lt;ref name="Krantz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krantz | first1 = Gunilla | last2 = Garcia-Moreno | first2 = Claudia | title = Violence against women | journal = [[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]] | volume = 59 | issue = 10 | pages = 818&amp;ndash;821 | publisher = [[BMJ Group]] | doi = 10.1136/jech.2004.022756 | jstor = 25570854 | pmid = 16166351 | pmc = 1732916 | date = October 2005 | url = https://doi.org/10.1136/jech.2004.022756 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some articles on VAW reiterate these conceptions by suggesting that men are the main perpetrators of this violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sen | first = Purna | title = Development practice and violence against women | journal = [[Gender &amp; Development]], special issue: Violence Against Women | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 7&amp;ndash;16 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] and [[Oxfam]] | doi = 10.1080/741922827 | jstor = 4030497 | date = November 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/741922827 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the definition stated by the 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women also supported the notion that violence is rooted in the inequality between men and women when the term violence is used together with the term 'gender-based.'&lt;ref name="Krantz"/&gt;

In ''Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence'', the Council of Europe stipulated that VAW "includes, but is not limited to, the following":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=30 April 2002 |url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383 |format=PDF |title=Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence |publisher=Council of Europe Committee of Ministers |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:a. violence occurring in the family or domestic unit, including, ''inter alia'', physical and mental aggression, emotional and psychological abuse, rape and sexual abuse, incest, rape between spouses, regular or occasional partners and cohabitants, crimes committed in the name of honour, female genital and sexual mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, such as forced marriages;

:b. violence occurring within the general community, including, ''inter alia'', rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in institutions or elsewhere trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation and economic exploitation and sex tourism;

:c. violence perpetrated or condoned by the state or its officials;

:d. violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict, in particular the taking of hostages, forced displacement, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and economic exploitation.

These definitions of VAW as being gender-based are seen by some to be unsatisfactory and problematic. These definitions are conceptualized in an understanding of society as patriarchal, signifying unequal relations between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ertürk | first = Yakin | title = Towards a post-patriarchal gender order: confronting the universality and the particularity of violence against women | journal = Sociologisk Forskning | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 61&amp;ndash;70 | publisher = Sveriges Sociologförbund [Swedish Sociological Association] | jstor = 20853687 | date = 2009 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of such definitions argue that the definitions disregard violence against men and that the term ''[[gender]]'', as used in ''gender based violence'', only refers to women. Other critics argue that employing the term ''gender'' in this particular way may introduce notions of inferiority and subordination for femininity and superiority for masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Visaria | first = Leela | title = Violence against women: a field study | journal = [[Economic and Political Weekly]] | volume = 35 | issue = 20 | pages = 1742&amp;ndash;1751 | publisher = Sameeksha Trust, Mumbai, India | jstor = 4409296 | date = 13 May 2000 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Michau | first = Lori | title = Approaching old problems in new ways: community mobilisation as a primary prevention strategy to combat violence against women | journal = [[Gender &amp; Development]], special issue: Gender-based Violence | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 95&amp;ndash;109 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] and [[Oxfam]] | doi = 10.1080/13552070601179144 | jstor = 20461184 | date = March 2007 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/13552070601179144 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no widely accepted current definition that covers all the dimensions of gender-based violence rather than the one for women that tends to reproduce the concept of binary oppositions: masculinity versus femininity.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. 2013"/&gt;

The history of violence against women remains vague in scientific literature. This is in part because many kinds of violence against women (specifically rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence) are under-reported, often due to societal norms, taboos, stigma, and the sensitive nature of the subject.&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watts | first1 = Charlotte | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Cathy | title = Violence against women: global scope and magnitude | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 359 | issue = 9313 | pages = 1232&amp;ndash;1237 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | pmid = 11955557 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08221-1 | date = 6 April 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08221-1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely recognized that even today, a lack of reliable and continuous data is an obstacle to forming a clear picture of violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women"&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations |title=In-depth study on all forms of violence against women.

According to the UN, "there is no region of the world, no country and no culture in which women's freedom from violence has been secured."&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; Several forms of violence are more prevalent in certain parts of the world, often in [[developing countries]]. For example, [[dowry death|dowry violence]] and [[bride burning]] is associated with [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Nepal]]. [[Acid throwing]] is also associated with these countries, as well as in [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Cambodia]]. [[Honor killing]] is associated with the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]]. [[Female genital mutilation]] is found mostly in [[Africa]], and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and some other parts of Asia. [[Marriage by abduction]] is found in [[Ethiopia]], [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]]. Abuse related to payment of [[bride price]] (such as violence, trafficking and forced marriage) is linked to parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania.

Certain regions are no longer associated with a specific form of violence, but such violence was common until quite recently in those places; this is true of honor-based crimes in Southern/Mediterranean Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirti | first1 = Anand | last2 = Kumar | first2 = Prateek | last3 = Yadav | first3 = Rachana | title = The face of honour based crimes: global concerns and solutions | journal = International Journal of Criminal Justice Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 343&amp;ndash;357 | publisher = South Asian Society of Criminology &amp; Victimology (SASCV) | date = 2011 | url = http://www.sascv.org/ijcjs/pdfs/kirtietalicjs2011i&amp;iind.pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[Italy]], before 1981, the Criminal Code provided for mitigating circumstances in case of a killing of a woman or her sexual partner for reasons related to honor, providing for a reduced sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Barazzetti | first1 = Donatella | last2 = Garreffa | first2 = Franca | last3 = Marsico | first3 = Rosaria | title = Daphne Project "Proposing new indicators: measuring violence's effects, GVEI (Gender Violence Effects Indicators)" | url = http://www.surt.org/gvei/docs/national_report_italy.pdf | publisher = Centre Women’s Studies “Milly Villa”, [[University of Calabria]] | location = Rende, Italy | date = July 2007 | quote = Before 1981, Art. 587 read: He who causes the death of a spouse, daughter, or sister upon discovering her in illegitimate carnal relations and in the heat of passion caused by the offence to his honour or that of his family will be sentenced to three to seven years. The same sentence shall apply to whom, in the above circumstances, causes the death of the person involved in illegitimate carnal relations with his spouse, daughter, or sister.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invoking culture to explain particular forms of violence against women risks appearing to legitimize them. There is also debate and controversy about the ways in which cultural traditions, local customs and social expectations, as well as various interpretations of religion, interact with abusive practices.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Narayan | first = Uma | chapter = Cross‐cultural connections, border‐crossings, and "Death by Culture": thinking about dowry-murders in India and domestic‐violence murders in the United States | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lzQ49LnmL_cC&amp;pg=PA81 | editor-last = Narayan | editor-first = Uma | title = Dislocating cultures: identities, traditions, and Third-World feminism | pages = 81&amp;ndash;118 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780415914192 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, cultural justifications for certain violent acts against women are asserted by some states and social groups within many countries claiming to defend their traditions. These justifications are questionable precisely because the defenses are generally voiced by political leaders or traditional authorities, not by those actually affected.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; The need for sensitivity and respect of culture is an element that cannot be ignored either; thus a sensitive debate has ensued and is ongoing.

There has also been a history of recognizing the harmful effects of this violence. In the 1870s, courts in the United States stopped recognizing the common-law principle that a husband had the right to "physically chastise an errant wife".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Calvert | first = Robert | chapter = Criminal and civil liability in husband-wife assaults | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fCpHAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Steinmetz | editor-first1 = Suzanne | editor-last2 = Straus | editor-first2 = Murray A. | author-link2 = Murray A.

Jackson [1891]. 1 Q.B. 671&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Corporal punishment | title = [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] | edition = 11th | year = 1911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th and 21st centuries, and in particular since the 1990s, there has been increased activity on both the national and international levels to research, raise awareness and advocate for the prevention of all kinds of violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; Most often, violence against women has been framed as a health issue, and also as a violation of human rights. A study in 2002 estimated that at least one in five women in the world had been physically or sexually abused by a man sometime in their lives, and "gender-based violence accounts for as much death and ill-health in women aged 15–44 years as cancer, and is a greater cause of ill-health than malaria and traffic accidents combined."&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt;

Certain characteristics of violence against women have emerged from the research. For example, acts of violence against women are often not unique episodes, but are ongoing over time. More often than not, the violence is perpetrated by someone the woman knows, not by a stranger.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt; The research seems to provide convincing evidence that violence against women is a severe and pervasive problem the world over, with devastating effects on the health and well-being of women and children.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;

===Milestones===
Some of the most important milestones on the international level for the prevention of violence against women include:

*The 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), which recognizes violence as a part of discrimination against women in recommendations 12 and 19.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global norms and standards: Ending violence against women|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/global-norms-and-standards|publisher=[[UN Women]]|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1993 [[World Conference on Human Rights]], which recognized violence against women as a human rights violation, and which contributed to the following UN declaration.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards" /&gt;
*The 1993 UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] was the first international instrument explicitly defining and addressing violence against women. This document specifically refers to the historically forever-present nature of gender inequalities in understanding violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"/&gt; (Include current 2nd paragraph here). This Declaration, as well as the World Conference of the same year, is often viewed as a "turning point" at which the consideration of violence against women by the international community began to be taken much more seriously, and after which more countries mobilized around this problem.&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Venis | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Horton | first2 = Richard | title = Violence against women: a global burden | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 359 | issue = 9313 | page = 1172 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | pmid = 11955533 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08251-X | date = 6 April 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08251-X | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO Multicountry Study"&gt;{{cite book | last = Garcia-Moreno | first = Claudia | title = WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women: initial results on prevalence, health outcomes and women's responses | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2005 | url = http://cdrwww.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/Introduction-Chapter1-Chapter2.pdf | isbn = 9789241593588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]], linking violence against women to reproductive health and rights, and also providing recommendations to governments on how to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"/&gt;
*In 1996, the [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) declared violence a major public health issue, and included in the subtypes recognized were intimate partner violence and sexual violence, two kinds of violence often perpetrated as violence against women. This was followed by a WHO report in 2002 (see below).&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Krug | first1 = Etienne G. | last2 = Dahlberg | first2 = Linda L. | last3 = Mercy | first3 = James A. | last4 = Zwi | first4 = Anthony B. | last5 = Lozano | first5 = Rafael | title = World report on violence and health | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2002 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=db9OHpk-TksC&amp;printsec=frontcover | isbn = 9789241545617 }}

*In 1999, the UN adopted the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] and designated [[November 25]] as the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt; 
*In 2002, as a follow-up of the WHA declaration in 1996 of violence as a major public health issue, the [[World Health Organization]] published the first World Report on Violence and Health, which addressed many types of violence and their effect on public health, including forms of violence affecting women particularly strongly. The report specifically noted the sharp rise in civil society organizations and activities directed at responding to gender-based violence against women from the 1970s to the 1990s.&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health" /&gt; 
*In 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] published its "Multi-country study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women", a study of women's health and [[domestic violence]] by surveying over 24,000 women in 10 countries from all regions of the world, which assessed the prevalence and extent of violence against women, particularly violence by intimate partners, and linked this with health outcomes to women as well as documenting strategies and services that women use to cope with intimate-partner violence.&lt;ref name="WHO Multicountry Study" /&gt;
*The 2006 UN Secretary General's "In-depth study on all forms of violence against women", the first comprehensive international document on the issue.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;
*The 2011 Council of Europe [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], which is the second regional legally-binding instrument on violence against women and girls.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"/&gt; 
*In 2013, the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] (CSW) adopted, by consensus, Agreed Conclusions on the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls (formerly, there were no agreed-upon conclusions).&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"/&gt;

Additionally, on the national level, individual countries have also organized efforts (legally, politically, socially) to prevent, reduce and punish violence against women. As a particular case study, here are some developments since the 1960s in the United States to oppose and treat violence against women:&lt;ref name="USDOJ-History of VAWA"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Violence Against Women (OVM)|title=The History of the Violence Against Women Act|url=http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/history-vawa.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=2 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017204719/http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/history-vawa.pdf|archivedate=17 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*1967: One of the country's first domestic violence shelters opened in Maine.
*1972: The country's first rape help hotline opened in Washington, D.C.
*1978: Two national coalitions, the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault and the [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]], were formed, to raise awareness of these two forms of violence against women.
*1984: The U.S. Attorney General created the Department of Justice Task Force on Family Violence, to address ways in which the criminal justice system and community response to domestic violence should be improved.
*1994: Passage of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] or VAWA, legislation included in the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] of 1994, sponsored by then-Senator Joseph Biden, which required a strengthened community response to crimes of domestic violence and sexual assault, strengthened federal penalties for repeat sex offenders and strengthened legislative protection of victims, among many other provisions.
*2000: President Clinton signed into law the VAWA of 2000, further strengthening federal laws, and emphasizing assistance of immigrant victims, elderly victims, victims with disabilities, and victims of dating violence.
*2006: President Bush signed into law the VAWA of 2006, with an emphasis on programs to address violence against youth victims, and establishing programs for Engaging Men and Youth, and Culturally and Linguistically Specific Services.
*2007: The National Teen Dating Abuse Hotline opened.
*2009: President Obama declared April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
*2013: President Obama signed into law the VAWA of 2015, which granted Native American tribes the ability to prosecute non-Native offenders, and regulated reports of sexual assault on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kohlman | first = Cindy | title = Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) New Reporting Requirements Effective July 1, 2015 – Are You Ready? | url = https://www.inceptia.org | publisher = Inceptia Institute | date = 9 June 2015 }}

Other countries have also enacted comparable legislative, political and social instruments to address violence against women. Experts in the international community generally believe, however, that solely enacting punitive legislation for prevention and punishment of violence against women is not sufficient to address the problem. For example, although much stricter laws on violence against women have been passed in Bangladesh, violence against women is still rising.&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt; Instead, it is thought that wide societal changes to address gender inequalities and women's empowerment will be the way to reduce violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigeria-Female Hawkers-Interventions"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fawole | first1 = Olufunmilayo I. | last2 = Ajuwon | first2 = Ademola J. | last3 = Osungbade | first3 = Kayode O. | last4 = Faweya | first4 = Olufemi C. | title = Interventions for violence prevention among young female hawkers in motor parks in South-Western Nigeria: a review of effectiveness | journal = [[African Journal of Reproductive Health]] [La Revue Africaine de la Santé Reproductive] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 71&amp;ndash;82 | publisher = Women's Health and Action Research Centre (WHARC) | doi = 10.2307/3583347 | jstor = 3583347 | date = April 2003 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO VAM Factsheet"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization |title=Violence against women|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]| date = 1 September 2011|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article in the [[Health and Human Rights (journal)|Health and Human Rights Journal]],&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt; regardless of many years of advocacy and involvement of many feminist activist organizations, the issue of violence against women still "remains one of the most pervasive forms of human rights violations worldwide".&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|91}} The violence against women can occur in both public and private spheres of life and at any time of their life span. Violence against women often keeps women from wholly contributing to social, economic, and political development of their communities.&lt;ref name="Fried"/&gt; Many women are terrified by these threats of violence and this essentially influences their lives so that they are impeded to exercise their human rights; for instance, they fear contributing to the development of their communities socially, economically and politically. Apart from that, the causes that trigger VAW or gender-based violence can go beyond just the issue of gender and into the issues of age, class, culture, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and specific geographical area of their origins.

Importantly, other than the issue of social divisions, violence can also extend into the realm of health issues and become a direct concern of the public health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Colarossi | first = Lisa | title = A response to Danis &amp; Lockhart: What guides social work knowledge about violence against women? | journal = Journal of Social Work Education | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 147&amp;ndash;159 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] on behalf of the [[Council on Social Work Education]] (CSWE) | doi = 10.517/FJSWE.2005.200400418 | jstor = 23044038 | date = Winter 2005 | ref = harv | postscript = .| doi-broken-date = 2018-06-01 }}

Significant progress towards the protection of women from violence has been made on international level as a product of collective effort of lobbying by many women's rights movements; international organizations to civil society groups. As a result, worldwide governments and international as well as civil society organizations actively work to combat violence against women through a variety of programs. Among the major achievements of the women's rights movements against violence on girls and women, the landmark accomplishments are the "[[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]]" that implies "political will towards addressing VAW " and the legal binding agreement, "the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[CEDAW]])".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rosche | first1 = Daniela | last2 = Dawe | first2 = Alexandra | title = Oxfam Briefing Note: Ending violence against women the case for a comprehensive international action plan |page=2 | publisher = [[Oxfam|Oxfam GB]] | location = Oxford | year = 2013 | url = http://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/bn-ending-violence-against-women-action-plan-220213-en.pdf | isbn = 9781780772639 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the UN General Assembly resolution also designated 25 November as [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations | title = International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women | url = https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/news/vawd.html | website = un.org | publisher = [[United Nations]] |date= 17 December 1999|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Another typology: over time ===
[[File:Typology of Violence Against Women over Time.png|thumbnail|300 px|A diagram of typology of violence against women over time, as conceived by authors Charlotte Watts &amp; Cathy Zimmerman.]]

This similar typology from an academic journal article on violence against women shows similarly the different types of violence perpetrated against women according to what time period in a women's life the violence takes place.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt; However, it also classifies the types of violence according to the perpetrator. One important point to note is that more of the types of violence inflicted on women are perpetrated by someone the woman knows, either a family member or intimate partner, rather than a stranger.

==Types==
Violence against women can take a number of forms:

===Rape===
{{main|Rape}}
Rape is a type of [[sexual assault]], usually involving [[sexual intercourse]]. Rape is usually perpetrated by men against boys, women, and girls; women are usually assaulted more often than boys and girls and usually all by someone they know.

Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 varied between 0.1 in [[Egypt]] per 100,000 people and 91.6 per 100,000 people in [[Lesotho]] with 4.9 per 100,000 people in [[Lithuania]] as the [[median]].&lt;ref name="unodc1"&gt;{{cite book | last = UNODC | author-link = United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | title = Rape at the National Level, number of police recorded offenses | url = http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Crime-statistics/Sexual_violence_sv_against_children_and_rape.xls | format = spreadsheet | publisher = [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Medical Association]] (1995), sexual violence, and rape in particular, is considered the most underreported violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = AMA | author-link = American Medical Association | title = Strategies for the treatment and prevention of sexual assault | publisher = [[American Medical Association]] | location = Chicago, Illinois | year = 1995 | oclc = 33901581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rds.homeoffice.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kelly | first1 = Liz | last2 = Regan | first2 = Linda | last3 = Lovett | first3 = Jo | author-link = Liz Kelly | title = A gap or a chasm?: Attrition in reported rape cases | publisher = Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate | location = London | id = 293 | year = 2005 | isbn = 9781844735556 | archiveurl = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf | archivedate = 18 February 2011 | url = http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf | format = pdf | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all | accessdate = 31 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of reporting, prosecution and convictions for rape varies considerably in different jurisdictions. Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by persons the victim knows.&lt;ref&gt;''Relevant citations'':

====Violence against victims====
Following a rape, a victim may face violence or threats of violence from the rapist, and, in many cultures, from the victim's own family and relatives. Violence or intimidation of the victim may be perpetrated by the rapist or by friends and relatives of the rapist, as a way of preventing the victims from reporting the rape, of punishing them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint; or it may be perpetrated by the relatives of the victim as a punishment for "bringing shame" to the family. This is especially the case in cultures where female [[virginity]] is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in [[honor killings]]. Victims may also be forced by their families to marry the rapist in order to restore the family's "honor".&lt;ref&gt;''Relevant articles'':

===Marital rape===
{{Main|Marital rape}}
Marital rape, also known as spousal rape, is non-consensual sex perpetrated by the victim's spouse. Once widely condoned or ignored by law, spousal rape is now repudiated by international conventions and increasingly criminalized. Still, in many countries, spousal rape either remains legal, or is illegal but widely tolerated and accepted as a husband's prerogative. The criminalization of marital rape is recent, having occurred during the past few decades. Traditional understanding and views of [[marriage]], [[rape]], [[sexuality]], [[gender roles]] and [[self determination]] have started to be challenged in most Western countries during the 1960s and 1970s, which has led to the subsequent criminalization of marital rape during the following decades. With a few notable exceptions, it was during the past 30 years when most laws against marital rape have been enacted. Some countries in Scandinavia and in the former Communist Bloc of Europe made spousal rape illegal before 1970, but most Western countries criminalized it only in the 1980s and 1990s. In many parts of the world the laws against marital rape are very new, having been enacted in the 2000s.

In [[Canada]], marital rape was made illegal in 1983, when several legal changes were made, including changing the rape statute to ''sexual assault'', and making the laws gender neutral.&lt;ref name=grady&gt;{{cite book | last = Grady | first = William | title = Crime in Canadian context: debates and controversies | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780195433784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brennan | first1 = Shannon| last2 = Taylor-Butts | first2 = Andrea | title = Sexual assault in Canada, 2004 | publisher = Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics | location = Ottawa | year = 2008 |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85f0033m/85f0033m2008019-eng.pdf | format = pdf | isbn = 9781100111636 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = SIECCAN |title=Sexual assault in Canada: what do we know? |publisher=The Sex Information and Education Council of Canada (SIECCAN) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140722071229/http://sexualityandu.ca/uploads/files/SexualAssault-OCT2011-ENG.pdf | archive-date = 22 July 2014 |url=http://sexualityandu.ca/uploads/files/SexualAssault-OCT2011-ENG.pdf | date = October 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] spousal rape was outlawed in 1990.&lt;ref name="Temkin86"&gt;{{cite book | last = Temkin | first = Jennifer | chapter = Defining and redefining rape | editor-last = Temkin | editor-first = Jennifer | title = Rape and the legal process | page = 86 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2002 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780198763543 }}

In [[England and Wales]], marital rape was made illegal in 1991. The views of Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century jurist, published in ''The History of the Pleas of the Crown'' (1736), stated that a husband cannot be guilty of the rape of his wife because the wife "hath given up herself in this kind to her husband, which she cannot retract"; in England and Wales this would remain law for more than 250 years, until it was abolished by the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]], in the case of ''R v R'' in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html |title=R v R [1991&amp;#93; UKHL 12 (23 October 1991) |publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Netherlands]] marital rape was also made illegal in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zeegers | first = Nicolle | title = What epistemology would serve criminal law best in finding the truth about rape? | journal = Law and Method | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 60&amp;ndash;71 | date = January 2012 | url = http://www.lawandmethod.nl/tijdschrift/lawandmethod/2012/1/ReM_2212-2508_2012_002_001_005 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.bjutijdschriften.nl/tijdschrift/lawandmethod/2012/1/ReM_2212-2508_2012_002_001_005.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the last Western countries to criminalize marital rape was [[Germany]], in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Kieler |first=Marita|date=2003|title=Tatbestandsprobleme der sexuellen Nötigung, Vergewaltigung sowie des sexuellen Mißbrauchs widerstandsunfähiger Personen|publisher=[[University of Osnabrück]] via Tenea | url = http://www.jurawelt.com/dissertationen/werke/8821|oclc=758907108}} [http://www.jurawelt.com/sunrise/media/mediafiles/13792/tenea_juraweltbd52_kieler.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between some religions ([[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]) and marital rape is controversial. The [[Bible]] at 1 Corinthians 7:3-5 explains that one has a "conjugal duty" to have sexual relations with one's spouse (in sharp opposition to [[sex outside marriage]], which is considered a [[sin]]) and states, "The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does.

{{main|Domestic violence}}
Women are more likely to be [[victimized]] by someone that they are intimate with, commonly called "[[intimate partner violence]]" or (IPV). Instances of IPV tend not to be reported to police and thus many experts believe that the true magnitude of the problem is hard to estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Intimate partner violence: fact sheet | url = https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/ipvfacts.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211183916/http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/ipvfacts.htm | archive-date = 11 February 2007 | website = cdc.gov/ncipc | publisher = National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = 2006 | accessdate = 4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are much more likely than men to be [[murdered]] by an intimate partner.

In Western Europe, a country that has received major international criticism for the way it has dealt legally with the issue of violence against women is [[Finland]]; with authors pointing that a high level of equality for women in the public sphere (as in Finland) should never be equated with equality in all other aspects of women's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Clarke | first = Kris | title = The paradoxical approach to intimate partner violence in Finland | journal = [[Tokiwa University#Publications|International Perspectives in Victimology]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–19 | publisher = [[Tokiwa University]] via [[California State University|The Press at California State University]] | doi = 10.5364/ipiv.6.1.19 | date = August 2011 | ref = harv | doi-broken-date = 2018-06-01 }} [https://www.academia.edu/992154/The_Paradoxical_Approach_to_Intimate_Partner_Violence_in_Finland Available through academia.edu.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McKie |first1=Linda |last2=Hearn |first2=Jeff |title=Gender-neutrality and gender equality: comparing and contrasting policy responses to 'domestic violence' in Finland and Scotland |journal=[[Scottish Affairs]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=85–107 |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |doi=10.3366/scot.2004.0043 |date=August 2004 |ref=harv }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20131021023708/http://www.scottishaffairs.org/backiss/pdfs/sa48/sa48_McKie_and_Hearn.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 2008 |title=Case Closed: Rape and Human Rights in the Nordic Countries |publisher=Amnesty International |url=https://amnesty.dk/media/1557/case-closed.pdf | pages = 89–91 | quote = Finland is repeatedly reminded of its widespread problem of violence against women and recommended to take more efficient measures to deal with the situation. International criticism concentrates on the lack of measures to combat violence against women in general and in particular on the lack of a national action plan to combat such violence and on the lack of legislation on domestic violence. (...) Compared to Sweden, Finland has been slower to reform legislation on violence against women. In Sweden, domestic violence was already illegal in 1864, while in Finland such violence was not outlawed until 1970, over a hundred years later. In Sweden the punishment of victims of incest was abolished in 1937, but not until 1971 in Finland. Rape within marriage was criminalised in Sweden in 1962, but the equivalent Finnish legislation only came into force in 1994 – making Finland one of the last European countries to criminalise marital rape. In addition, assaults taking place on private property did not become impeachable offences in Finland until 1995. Only in 1997 did victims of sexual offences and domestic violence in Finland become entitled to government-funded counselling and support services for the duration of their court cases. | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Diagnosis planning====
The [[American Psychiatric Association]] planning and research committees for the forthcoming [[DSM-5]] (2013) have canvassed a series of new [[Relational disorder]]s, which include ''Marital Conflict Disorder Without Violence'' or ''Marital Abuse Disorder (Marital Conflict Disorder With Violence)''.&lt;ref name="Personality"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = First | first1 = Michael B. | last2 = Bell | first2 = Carl C. | last3 = Cuthbert | first3 = Bruce | last4 = Krystal | first4 = John H. | last5 = Malison | first5 = Robert | last6 = Offord | first6 = David R. | last7 = Reiss | first7 = David | last8 = Shea | first8 = M.

Secondly, there is serious violence in the marriage that is -"usually the husband battering the wife".&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|163}} In these cases the emergency room or a legal authority often is the first to notify the [[clinician]]. Most importantly, marital violence "is a major risk factor for serious injury and even death and women in violent marriages are at much greater risk of being seriously injured or killed ([[National Advisory Council on Violence Against Women]] 2000)".&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|166}} The authors of this study add, "There is current considerable controversy over whether male-to-female marital violence is best regarded as a reflection of male [[psychopathology]] and control or whether there is an empirical base and clinical utility for conceptualizing these patterns as relational."&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|166}}

Recommendations for clinicians making a diagnosis of ''Marital Relational Disorder'' should include the assessment of actual or "potential" male violence as regularly as they assess the potential for suicide in depressed patients. Further, "clinicians should not relax their vigilance after a battered wife leaves her husband, because some data suggest that the period immediately following a marital separation is the period of greatest risk for the women. Many men will [[stalking|stalk]] and [[battery (crime)|batter]] their wives in an effort to get them to return or punish them for leaving. Initial assessments of the potential for violence in a marriage can be supplemented by standardized interviews and questionnaires, which have been reliable and valid aids in exploring marital violence more systematically."&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|166}}
 
The authors conclude with what they call "very recent information"&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}} on the course of violent marriages, which suggests that "over time a husband's battering may abate somewhat, but perhaps because he has successfully [[intimidate]]d his wife. The risk of violence remains strong in a marriage in which it has been a feature in the past. Thus, treatment is essential here; the clinician cannot just wait and watch."&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}} The most urgent clinical priority is the protection of the wife because she is the one most frequently at risk, and clinicians must be aware that supporting assertiveness by a battered wife may lead to more beatings or even death.&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}}

====Honor killings====
[[Honor killings]] are a common form of violence against women in certain parts of the world. In honor killings, women and girls are killed by family members (usually husbands, fathers, uncles or brothers) because the women are believed to have brought shame or dishonor upon the family. These killings are a traditional practice, believed to have originated from tribal customs where an allegation against a woman can be enough to defile a family's reputation.&lt;ref name="BBC_ethics"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Ethics guide – Honour crimes | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml | work = [[BBC]] | date = | access-date = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Definition of honor killing | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honor%20killing | website = merriam-webster.com | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | access-date = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are killed for reasons such as refusing to enter an [[arranged marriage]], being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives, attempting to leave a marriage, having sex outside marriage, becoming the victim of rape, dressing in ways that are deemed inappropriate.&lt;ref name="BBC_ethics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | last = Harter | first = Pascale | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895 | publisher= [[BBC News]] | title=Libya rape victims 'face honour killings' | date=14 June 2011| access-date = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dowry violence====
[[Image:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|upright|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]

The custom of [[dowry]], which is common in South Asia, especially in India, is the trigger of many forms of violence against women. [[Bride burning]] is a form of violence against women in which a bride is killed at home by her husband or husband's family due to his dissatisfaction over the dowry provided by her family. [[Dowry death]] refers to the phenomenon of women and girls being killed or committing [[suicide]] due to disputes regarding dowry. Dowry violence is common in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. In India, in 2011 alone, the National Crime Records Bureau reported 8,618 dowry deaths, while unofficial figures suggest the numbers to be at least three times higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Confronting dowry-related violence in India: women at the center of justice | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2012/12/confronting-dowry-related-violence-in-india-women-at-the-center-of-justice | publisher = [[UN Women]] | date = 24 December 2012 | access-date = 18 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[forced marriage]] is a marriage in which one or both of the parties is married against their will. Forced marriages are common in South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The customs of [[bride price]] and [[dowry]], that exist in many parts of the world, contribute to this practice. A forced marriage is also often the result of a dispute between families, where the dispute is 'resolved' by giving a female from one family to the other.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

The custom of [[bride kidnapping]] continues to exist in some Central Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and the Caucasus, or parts of Africa, especially Ethiopia. A girl or a woman is abducted by the would be groom, who is often helped by his friends. The victim is often raped by the would be groom, after which he may try to negotiate a bride price with the village elders to legitimize the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''News articles'':

====Force-feeding====
In some countries, notably Mauritania, young girls are forcibly fattened to prepare them for marriage, because obesity is seen as desirable. This practice of [[force-feeding]] is known as ''[[leblouh]]'' or ''gavage''.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

====Abuse related to son-preference====

[[File:Chinese anti infanticide tract from 1800.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chinese anti-infanticide tract circa 1800. China has a long history of son preference, which was aggravated after the enforcement of the [[one child policy]].]]
''Son preference'' is a custom rooted in gender inequality that is prevalent in many countries and found across religions and classes.&lt;ref name="StopVAW_son"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Son preference | url =http://www.stopvaw.org/harmful_practices_son_preference | website = stopvaw.org | publisher = Stop Violence Against Women | date = June 2010 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although preference for a specific sex of the child may be common in an abstract way in many cultures, when such preference is so strong as to lead to the rejection of the child or to violence against the mother, this crosses the line into [[domestic violence]], [[child abuse]] and violence against women. Such forms of son preference are common especially in parts of [[South Asia]], [[East Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]]. Manifestations of such practices include [[sex selective abortion]], [[female infanticide]], [[child abandonment|female child abandonment]], as well as favoring sons with regard to allocating of family resources.&lt;ref name="StopVAW_son" /&gt;

[[China]] and [[India]] have a very strong son preference. In China, the [[one child policy]] was largely responsible for an unbalanced sex ratio. Sex-selective abortion, as well as rejection of girl children is common. [[The Dying Rooms]] is a 1995 [[television]] [[documentary film]] about Chinese state orphanages, which documented how parents abandoned their newborn girls into [[orphanages]], where the staff would leave the children in rooms to die of thirst, or starvation.
Another manifestation of son preference is the violence inflicted against mothers who give birth to girls.&lt;ref&gt;''News articles'':

===Reproductive coercion===
[[File:Mauricio rugendas - el malon.jpg|thumb|The painting depicts a Chilean woman being kidnapped during a [[malón]]. [[Bride kidnapping]] for the purpose of [[forced marriage]] and [[forced pregnancy]] was common through the history in many countries.]]
{{Main|Reproductive coercion|Forced pregnancy|Bride kidnapping}}
Reproductive coercion is violent, manipulative or deceptive behavior against [[reproductive health]] or [[reproductive rights]] within an intimate relation and includes a collection of behaviors intended to lead to [[forced pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="ACOG"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Committee on Health Care for Underserved Women | title = Committee Opinion No. 554: Reproductive and Sexual Coercion | journal = [[Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (journal)|Obstetrics and Gynecology]] | volume = 121 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 411&amp;ndash;415 | publisher = [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|LWW]] | pmid = 23344307 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000426427.79586.3b | date = February 2013 | url = https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Health-Care-for-Underserved-Women/Reproductive-and-Sexual-Coercion | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive coercion is a form of [[domestic violence]], also known as [[intimate partner violence]], where behavior concerning reproductive health is used to maintain power, control, and domination within a relationship and over a partner through an unwanted pregnancy. It is considered a serious public health issue.&lt;ref name="ACOG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chamberlain | first1 = Linda | last2 = Levenson | first2 = Rebecca | title = Reproductive health and partner violence guidelines: an integrated response to intimate partner Violence and reproductive coercion | url = http://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/userfiles/file/HealthCare/Repro_Guide.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = Family Violence Prevention Fund | location = San Francisco | date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reproductive control is highly correlated to [[unintended pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coker | first = Ann L. | title = Does physical intimate partner violence affect sexual health?

Forced pregnancy is the practice of forcing a woman or girl to become [[pregnant]], often as part of a [[forced marriage]], including by means of [[bride kidnapping]], through rape (including [[marital rape]], [[war rape]] and [[genocidal rape]]) or as part of a program of breeding [[slave]]s (see [[Slave breeding in the United States]]). In the 20th century, state mandated forced marriage with the aim of increasing the population was practiced by some authoritarian governments, notably during the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]], which systematically forced people into marriages ordering them to have children, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Natalae | title = Memorandum: Charging forced marriage as a crime against humanity | url =http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = Documentation Center of Cambodia | date = 22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced pregnancy is strongly connected to the custom of [[bride price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women’s fears and men’s anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.1999.00054.x}} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the discourse on reproductive rights, the issue of [[abortion]] is often debated. [[Abortion law]] falls within the jurisdiction of each country, although [[forced abortion]] is prohibited by international law. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits forced abortion and [[forced sterilization]] (Article 39).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = CoE | author-link = Council of Europe | title = Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence | url = https://rm.coe.int/168046031c | publisher = [[Council of Europe]] | date = 12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of ''forced continuation of pregnancy'' (i.e. denying a woman safe and legal abortion) is also seen by some organizations as a violation of women's rights, although there are no binding international obligations on this issue. However, the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women's sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states, "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, ''criminalisation of abortion'', ''denial or delay of safe abortion and post abortion care'', ''forced continuation of pregnancy'', abuse and mistreatment of women and girls seeking sexual and reproductive health information, goods and services, are forms of gender based violence that, depending on the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women | author-link = Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women#Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women | title = General recommendation No. 35 on gender-based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19 | url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf | publisher = [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) | id = CEDAW/C/GC/35 | date = 14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mob violence===
In 2010 [[Amnesty International]] reported that [[Hassi Messaoud mob attacks against women|mob attacks]] against single women were taking place in [[Hassi Messaoud]], Algeria.&lt;ref name="Amnesty"&gt;{{cite web|title=Algerian authorities must investigate and stop attacks against women|url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/22931/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=13 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903140432/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/22931/|archivedate=3 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amnesty International, "some women have been sexually abused" and were targeted "not just because they are women, but because they are living alone and are economically independent".&lt;ref name="Amnesty" /&gt;

===Dating abuse===
{{See|Dating abuse|Teen dating violence}}
Dating abuse or dating violence is the perpetration of coercion, intimidation or assault in the context of [[dating]] or [[courtship]]. It is also when one partner tries to maintain [[abusive power and control]]. Dating violence is defined by the CDC as "the physical, sexual, psychological, or emotional violence within a dating relationship, including stalking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Intimate partner violence: teen dating violence | url = https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/teen_dating_violence.html | website = cdc.gov | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = 2016 | accessdate = 21 October 2017}} [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/teen-dating-violence-factsheet-a.pdf Fact sheet pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries it is common for older men to engage in "compensated dating" with underage girls. Such relationships are called [[enjo kōsai]] in Japan, and are also common in Asian countries such as Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong. The WHO condemned "economically coerced sex (e.g. school girls having sex with “sugar daddies” in return for school fees)" as a form of violence against women.&lt;ref name="WHO_VAW" /&gt;

===Sexual violence on college campuses===

===Restrictions on freedom of movement===
Women are, in many parts of the world, severely restricted in their [[freedom of movement]].
Freedom of movement is an essential right, recognized by international instruments, including Article 15 (4) of [[CEDAW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  UN General Assembly | author-link =  UN General Assembly | title = The convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (CEDAW) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140326154350/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm | archive-date = 26 March 2014 | url = http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm | publisher = [[UN Women|UN Women, Division for the Advancement of Women]] | date = 1979 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in some countries, women are not legally allowed to leave home without a [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|male guardian]] (male relative or husband).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lee | first = Dave | title = Saudi Arabian woman challenges male guardianship laws | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13932287 | work = [[BBC World Service]] | date = 29 June 2011 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in countries where there are no laws against women traveling alone, there are strong social norms, such as [[purdah]] - a religious and social practice of female [[seclusion]] prevalent especially among some [[Muslim]] and [[Hindu]] communities in [[South Asia]]. Many countries have laws on what type of clothing women may or may not wear in public (see [[Hijab by country]]). Women in some cultures are forced into [[social isolation]] during their [[menstruation|menstrual period]]s. In parts of Nepal for instance, they are forced to live in sheds, are forbidden to touch men or even to enter the courtyard of their own homes, and are barred from consuming milk, yogurt, butter, meat, and various other foods, for fear they will contaminate those goods. (see [[Chhaupadi]]). Women have died during this period because of starvation, bad weather, or bites by snakes.&lt;ref&gt;''Articles'':

===Denial of medical care===
[[File:Maternal mortality rate worldwide.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Maternal Mortality Rate]] worldwide, as defined by the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management, excluding accidental or incidental causes.&lt;ref name=CIA2010&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html?countryName=Australia&amp;countryCode=as&amp;regionCode=aus&amp;rank=156#as Country Comparison: Maternal Mortality Rate] in [[:en:The World Factbook|The CIA World Factbook]]. Date of Information: 2010&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Women in many parts of the world are often denied medical care. Denial of access to 
health assistance, along with denial of access to other services, is a form of socioeconomic violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.womensrefugeecommission.org/images/zdocs/gl_sgbv03_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the WHO, "Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/discrimination-in-health-care/en/|title=Joint United Nations statement on ending discrimination in health care settings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women may be denied medical care for numerous reasons, including lack of necessary [[freedom of movement]] allowing women to leave home so they can go to a medical facility, lack of financial resources, the need (in law or in practice) for a male relative or husband to consent to the medical care of the woman. A common consequence of denial of women's medical care is [[maternal mortality]]. Globally, there are more than 300.000 cases of maternal mortality yearly, with 99% of all maternal deaths occurring in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|title=Maternal mortality|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denial of medical care often occurs with regard to reproductive and sexual health. Sometimes women themselves avoid the medical system  for fear of being reported to the police or facing family violence due to having [[premarital sex]] or being the victims of [[sexual violence]]. In some parts of Latin America, with very strict anti-abortion laws, pregnant women avoid the medical system due to fear of being investigated by the authorities if they have a miscarriage, or a stillbirth, or other problems with the pregnancy. Prosecuting such women is quite common in places such as [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/07/el-salvador-rape-survivor-sentenced-to-30-years-in-jail-under-extreme-anti-abortion-law/|title=El Salvador: Rape survivor sentenced to 30 years in jail under extreme anti-abortion law|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-latin-america-32491838/el-salvador-women-jailed-for-miscarriages|title=Jailed for a miscarriage|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Prügl, E.

===Stalking===
{{Main|Stalking}}
Stalking is unwanted or obsessive attention by an individual or group toward another person, often manifested through persistent [[harassment]], [[intimidation]], or following/monitoring of the victim. Stalking is often understood as "course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/stalking-resource-center/stalking-information |title=Stalking information |website =victimsofcrime.org | publisher = Stalking Resource Center |date= |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although stalkers are frequently portrayed as being strangers, they are most often known people, such as former or current partners, friends, colleagues or acquaintances.

===Sexual harassment===
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is abusive, uninvited and unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature, typically in the work/studying place, which may include [[intimidation]], [[bullying]] or [[coercion]] of a sexual nature, or the inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors. It can be verbal or physical, and it is often perpetrated by a person in a position of authority against a subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/whatissh.pdf |format=pdf |title=What is sexual harassment |publisher=[[UN Women]] |accessdate=3 April 2016}}

The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] defines sexual harassment as: "any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment".&lt;ref name="COE 210" /&gt;

===Human trafficking and forced prostitution===
[[File:Map3.3Trafficking compressed.jpg|thumb|230px|right|A world map showing countries by prevalence of female trafficking]]

Human trafficking refers to the acquisition of persons by improper means such as force, fraud or deception, with the aim of [[Exploitation of labour|exploiting]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = UNODC| author-link =United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/human-trafficking/index.html?ref=menuside |title=UNODC on human trafficking and migrant smuggling (index) |publisher=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] |date= |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = OSCE | author-link = OSCE|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/19223 |title=U.N. protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, supplementing the United Nations convention against transnational organized crime |publisher=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] |date=15 November 2000 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: "Trafficking in persons" shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.

A widow is a woman whose spouse has died. In some parts of the world, widows are subjected to serious forms of abuse, often fueled by traditional practices such as [[widow inheritance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Owen | first = Margaret | chapter = Human rights, equality and legal protection | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bh8sGfNKUTEC&amp;pg=PA181 | editor-last = Owen | editor-first = Margaret | title = A world of widows | publisher = Zed Books | location = London Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey | year = 1996 | isbn = 9781856494205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifice of widows (such as [[Sati (practice)|sati]]) has been prevalent historically in various cultures (especially in [[India]]). Although sati in India is today an almost defunct practice, isolated incidents have occurred in recent years, such as the 1987 sati of [[Roop Kanwar]], as well as several incidents in rural areas in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2178102.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Arrests in Indian ritual burning | date=7 August 2002 | access-date = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5366506.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Sons arrested in sati death probe | date=21 September 2006 | access-date = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those likely to be accused and killed as [[Modern witch-hunts|witche]]s are often widows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21725040-law-criminalising-sorcery-was-only-repealed-2013-gruesome-fate-witches-papua-new|title=The gruesome fate of “witches” in Papua New Guinea|publisher=economist.com |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of Africa, such as in Kenya, widows are viewed as impure and need to be 'cleansed'. This often requires having sex with someone. Those refusing to be cleansed risk getting beaten by superstitious villagers, who may also harm the woman's children. It is argued that this notion arose from the idea that if a husband dies, the woman may have performed witchcraft against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-10-23/these-kenyan-widows-are-fighting-against-sexual-cleansing|title=These Kenyan widows are fighting against sexual 'cleansing'|publisher=pri.org|accessdate=7 November 2018|date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widow inheritance (also known as bride inheritance) is a cultural and social practice whereby a widow is required to marry a male relative of her late husband, often his brother.

[[Witch trials in the early modern period]] (between the 15th and 18th centuries) were common in Europe and in the European colonies in North America. Today, there remain regions of the world (such as parts of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], rural [[North India]], and [[Papua New Guinea]]) where belief in [[witchcraft]] is held by many people, and women accused of being witches are subjected to serious violence.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

War rapes are rapes committed by soldiers, other combatants or civilians during armed conflict or war, or during military occupation, distinguished from sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service. It also covers the situation where women are forced into prostitution or [[sexual slavery]] by an occupying power. During World War II the Japanese military established brothels filled with "[[comfort women]]", girls and women who were forced into sexual slavery for soldiers, exploiting women for the purpose of creating access and entitlement for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benedict |first=Helen |url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3848/ |title=Why soldiers rape |work=[[In These Times]] |date=14 August 2008 | access-date = 10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Morris-Suzuki | first = Tessa | title = Japan's 'Comfort Women': It's time for the truth (in the ordinary, everyday sense of the word) | journal = Japan Focus (The Asia-Pacific Journal) | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | date = 1 March 2007 | url = http://www.japanfocus.org/-Tessa-Morris_Suzuki/2373  |accessdate=4 August 2011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape was committed during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] by members of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistani military]] and the [[militia]]s that supported them. Over a period of nine months, hundreds of thousands of women were raped. [[Susan Brownmiller]], in her report on the [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|atrocities]], said that girls from the age of eight to grandmothers of seventy-five suffered attacks. {{See also|Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War}}

Rape used as a weapon of war was practiced during the [[Bosnian War]] where rape was used as a highly systematized instrument of war by Serb armed forces predominantly targeting women and girls of the Bosniak ethnic group for physical and moral destruction. Estimates of the number of women raped during the war range from 50,000 to 60,000; as of 2010 only 12 cases have been prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UNSC | author-link = United Nations Security Council | title = Report of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia Since 1991 | id = A/52/375{{spaces|2}}S/1997/729 | publisher = [[United Nations Security Council]] |url=http://www.icty.org/x/file/About/Reports%20and%20Publications/AnnualReports/annual_report_1997_en.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804004034/http://www.icty.org/x/file/About/Reports%20and%20Publications/AnnualReports/annual_report_1997_en.pdf |archivedate=4 August 2012 | date = 18 September 1997 | access-date = 10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{See also|Rape during the Bosnian War}}

[[Stoning]], or lapidation, refers to a form of [[capital punishment]] whereby an organized group throws stones at an individual until the person dies. Stoning is a punishment that is included in the laws of several countries, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Pakistan, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and some states in Nigeria, as punishment for [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Batha | first = Emma | title = FACTBOX: Stoning - where does it happen? | work = [[Thomson Reuters Foundation News]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160125051613/http://news.trust.org//item/20130927165059-w9g0i | archive-date = 25 January 2016 | url = http://news.trust.org//item/20130927165059-w9g0i | publisher = [[Thomson Reuters Foundation]] | date = 29 September 2013 | access-date = 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flogging]] or flagellation is the act of methodically beating or whipping the human body. It is a judicial punishment in various countries for specific crimes, including [[sex outside marriage]]. These punishments employed for sexual relations outside marriage, apart from constituting a form of violence in themselves, can also deter victims of [[sexual violence]] from reporting the crime, because the victims may themselves be punished (if they cannot prove their case, if they are deemed to have been in the company of an unrelated male, or if they were unmarried and not virgins at the time of the rape).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lang | first = Olivia | title=Maldives girl to get 100 lashes for pre-marital sex | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21595814 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=26 February 2013 | access-date = 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jamali |first=Hasan |url=http://www.today.com/id/15836746/ns/today-today_news/t/rape-case-calls-saudi-legal-system-question/#.UolafidedO6 |title=Rape case brings Saudi laws into focus |work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] |publisher=[[NBC]] |date= |accessdate=19 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JdMstMvl?url=http://www.today.com/id/15836746/ns/today-today_news/t/rape-case-calls-saudi-legal-system-question/ |archivedate=14 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female genital mutilation (FGM) is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons".&lt;ref name="WHO FGM"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization |title=Female genital mutilation (factsheet) |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date= June 2000 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2013 UNICEF report, 125 million women and girls in Africa and the Middle East have experienced FGM.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;{{cite book | last = UNICEF | author-link = UNICEF | title = Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change | url = http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[UNICEF]] | date = 22 July 2013 | accessdate = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO states: "The procedure has no health benefits for girls and women" and "Procedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth increased risk of newborn deaths" and "FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women."&lt;ref name="WHO FGM"/&gt; According to a UNICEF report, the top rates for FGM are in Somalia (with 98 percent of women affected), Guinea (96 percent), Djibouti (93 percent), Egypt (91 percent), Eritrea (89 percent), Mali (89 percent), Sierra Leone (88 percent), Sudan (88 percent), Gambia (76 percent), Burkina Faso (76 percent), Ethiopia (74 percent), Mauritania (69 percent), Liberia (66 percent), and Guinea-Bissau (50 percent).&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

According to some local practitioners, it is believed that FGM is linked to cultural rites and customs. It is considered to be a traditional practice that continues to take place in different communities/countries of Africa and Middle East, including in places where it is banned by national legislation. FGM is defined as a "harmful traditional practice"&lt;ref name="Shell-Duncan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shell-Duncan | first = Bettina | title = From health to human rights: female genital cutting and the politics of intervention | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 110 | issue = 2 | pages = 225&amp;ndash;236 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2008.00028.x | date = June 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1548-1433.2008.00028.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance to the Inter-African Committee.

Due to globalization and immigration, FGM is spreading beyond the borders of Africa and Middle East, to countries such as Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, New Zealand, the U.S., and UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | chapter = Judging other cultures: the case of genital mutilation |chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=43U8DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120  | editor-last = Nussbaum | editor-first = Martha | editor-link = Martha Nussbaum| title = Sex &amp; social justice |pages=120–121 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 0195110323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits female genital mutilation (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence | url = https://rm.coe.int/168046031c | date = 12 April 2011 | access-date = 8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, in [[Africa]], FGM has been legally banned in Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

There exist several approaches that were set up by international health organizations and civil societies (for example, [[Tostan]]) aimed at eliminating the practice of FGM in implemented countries: 
# FGM as a Health issue (also known as health risks approach)
# FGM as a Human Rights issue (also known as Human Rights-based approach)

Some scholars suggests that, when dealing with FGM, it is necessary to take lessons from history, particularly 19th-century campaign against [[foot-binding]] in China,&lt;ref name="Kwame Appiah"&gt;{{cite news | last = Appiah | first = Kwame Anthony | author-link = Kwame Anthony Appiah | title = The art of social change | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/magazine/24FOB-Footbinding-t.html?pagewanted=all |work = [[The New York Times]] |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was successful.

Breast ironing (also known as "breast flattening") is the practice of pounding and massaging the [[breasts]] of a [[puberty|pubescent girl]], using hard or heated objects, in an attempt to try to make them stop developing or disappear.&lt;ref name="west-info.eu"&gt;{{cite book | last = Tapscott | first = Rebecca |title=Understanding breast "ironing": a study of the methods, motivations, and outcomes of breast flattening practices in Cameroon | url = http://www.west-info.eu/files/Feinstein-International-Center-Understanding-breast-ironing-a-study-of-the-methods-motivations-and-outcomes-of-breast-flattening-practices-in-Cameroon-20121.pdf |format=pdf | publisher= [[Feinstein International Center]] | date = 14 May 2012 | access-date = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Cameroon Breast Ironing"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sa'ah | first = Randy Joe | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5107360.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Cameroon girls battle 'breast ironing' | date=23 June 2006 | access-date = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Penney | first = Joe | url= https://widerimage.reuters.com/story/breast-ironing | work=[[Reuters]] |title= Breast ironing | date = 27 January 2014 | access-date = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically carried out by the girl's mother, with the aim of making the girl less sexually attractive to men and boys, so that her virginity is preserved and she can continue her education.&lt;ref name="BBC Cameroon Breast Ironing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ngunshi | first = Rosaline | title = Breast ironing: a harmful practice that has been silenced for too long | url = http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/cedaw_crc_contributions/GenderEmpowermentandDevelopment.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = Gender Empowerment and Development (GeED) | date = 24 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is practiced primarily in [[Cameroon]], but has also been reported across other areas in [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref name="west-info.eu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Cameroon Breast Ironing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Mabuse | first = Nkepile | title = Breast ironing tradition targeted in Cameroon | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/07/27/cameroon.breast.ironing/ | work=[[CNN]] | date=28 July 2011 | access-date = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breast ironing is very painful and can have negative emotional and physical consequences.&lt;ref name="west-info.eu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Cameroon Breast Ironing"/&gt;

===Obstetric violence===
{{See|Abuse during childbirth}}
"Obstetric violence" refers to acts categorized as physically or psychologically violent in the context of labor and birth. In most developed and many [[developing countries]], birth takes place in an increasingly medicalized environment; with numerous surgical interventions that the pregnant woman can sometimes be coerced into accepting, or which are done without her consent, or which are unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Habek | first1 = Dubravko | last2 = Vuković Bobić | first2 = Mirna | last3 = Hrgović | first3 = Zlatko | title = Possible feto-maternal clinical risk of the Kristeller’s expression | journal = [[Central European Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 3&amp;ndash;6 | publisher = [[Walter de Gruyter]] | doi = 10.2478/s11536-008-0008-z | date = 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.2478/s11536-008-0008-z | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO_Normal"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Care in normal birth: a practical guide | id = WHO/FRH/MSM/96.24 | url = http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/who_frh_msm_9624/en/ | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | series = Safe Motherhood Practical Guide | year = 1996 | access-date = 2 December 2013}} [http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/63167/1/WHO_FRH_MSM_96.24.pdf Pdf.]

Many such practices originate in patriarchal ideologies. The WHO stated: "in normal birth, there should be a valid reason to interfere with the natural process. The aim of care is to achieve a healthy mother and child with the least possible level of intervention compatible with safety."&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dobbeleir | first1 = Julie M.L.C.L. | last2 = Landuyt | first2 = Koenraad Van | last3 = Monstrey | first3 = Stan J. | title = Aesthetic surgery of the female genitalia | journal = Seminars in Plastic Surgery | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 130&amp;ndash;141 | publisher = [[Thieme Medical Publishers|Thieme]] | doi = 10.1055/s-0031-1281482 | pmc = 3312147 | date = May 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0031-1281482 | ref = harv | postscript = . | pmid=22547970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO_Normal" /&gt;

=== Violence against indigenous women ===
Indigenous women around the world are often targets of sexual assault or physical violence. Many indigenous communities are rural, with few resources and little help from the government or non-state actors. These groups also often have strained relationships with law enforcement, making prosecution difficult. Many indigenous societies also find themselves at the center of land disputes between nations and ethnic groups, often resulting in these communities bearing the brunt of national and ethnic conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = UNFPA | last2 = UNICEF | last3 = UN Women | last4 = ILO | last5 = Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children (OSRSG/VAC) | author-link1 = United Nations Population Fund | author-link2 = UNICEF | author-link3 = UN Women | author-link4 = International Labour Organization | title = Breaking the silence on violence against indigenous girls, adolescents and young women: A call to action based on an overview of existing evidence from Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America | url = http://www.unfpa.org/resources/breaking-silence-violence-against-indigenous-girls-adolescents-and-young-women | publisher = [[UNICEF]] | date = May 2013 | access-date = 10 May 2016}} [https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/resource-pdf/VAIWG_FINAL.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence against indigenous women is often perpetrated by the state, such as in [[Peru]], in the 1990s. President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a [[forced sterilization]] program put in place by his administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Mass sterilization scandal shocks Peru | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 24 July 2002 | access-date = 30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]), in the name of a "[[public health]] plan", presented 28 July 1995.

[[Guatemala]]n indigenous women have also faced extensive violence. Throughout over three decades of conflict, [[Maya civilization|Maya]] women and girls have continued to be targeted. The Commission for Historical Clarification found that 88% of women affected by state-sponsored rape and sexual violence against women were indigenous.

The concept of white dominion over indigenous women's bodies has been rooted in American history since the beginning of colonization. The theory of manifest destiny went beyond simple land extension and into the belief that European settlers had the right to exploit Native women's bodies as a method of taming and "humanizing" them.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roe | first1 = Bubar | last2 = Jumper Thurman | first2 = Pamela | title = Violence against native women | journal = [[Social Justice (journal)|Social Justice]], special issue: Native Women and State Violence | volume = 31 | issue = 4 [98] | pages = 70&amp;ndash;86 | publisher = Social Justice | jstor = 29768276 | date = 2004 | url = http://www.socialjusticejournal.org/?product=roe-bubar-and-pamela-jumper-thurman-2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ramirez | first = Renya | title = Healing, violence, and Native American women | journal = [[Social Justice (journal)|Social Justice]], special issue: Native Women and State Violence | volume = 31 | issue = 4 [98] | pages = 103&amp;ndash;116 | publisher = Social Justice | jstor = 29768279 | date = 2004 | url = http://www.socialjusticejournal.org/?product=renya-ramirez-2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canada]] has an extensive problem with violence against indigenous women, by both indigenous men and non-aboriginals.

The history of [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]] and economic inequality of indigenous Canadians has resulted in communities facing violence, unemployment, drug use, alcoholism, political corruption, and high rates of suicide.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"/&gt; In addition, there has been clear and admitted racism towards indigenous people by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], making victims less likely to report cases of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jackson |first=Kenneth |title=Top Mountie Admits Racism in Ranks towards Indigenous People |work=[[Aboriginal People's Television Network]] |date=9 December 2015 |url=http://aptn.ca/news/2015/12/09/top-mountie-admits-racism-in-ranks-towards-indigenous-people/ | access-date = 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the issues facing indigenous women in Canada have been addressed via the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women (MMIW) initiatives. Thousands of Native Canadian women have gone missing or been killed in the past 30 years, with little representation or attention from the government. Efforts to make the Canadian public aware of these women's disappearances have mostly been led by Aboriginal communities, who often reached across provinces to support one another. In 2015, prime minister [[Stephen Harper]] commented that the issue of murdered and missing indigenous women was "not high on our radar",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Full Text of Peter Mansbridge's interview with Stephen Harper | work = [[CBC News]] | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2105-full-text-of-peter-mansbridge-s-interview-with-stephen-harper-1.3218399 | date = 7 September 2015 | access-date = 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting outrage in already frustrated indigenous communities. A few months later, Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] launched an official inquiry into the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women.

In the United States, Native American women are more than twice as likely to experience violence than any other demographic.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"/&gt; One in three Native women is sexually assaulted during her life, and over 85% of these assaults are perpetrated by non-Natives.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chekuru | first = Kavitha | title = Sexual violence scars Native American Women | url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/03/201334111633172507.html | work = [[Al Jazeera]] | date = 6 March 2013 | access-date = 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disproportionate rate of assault to indigenous women is due to a variety of causes, including but not limited to the legal inability of tribes to prosecute perpetrators who are not tribal members. Tribes currently cannot exercise criminal jurisdiction over non-Natives. In theory, tribes can send cases to the federal level in order to prosecute non-Natives, but the majority of these cases are thrown out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Bachman | first1 = Ronet | last2 = Zaykowski| first2 = Heather | last3 = Kallmyer | first3 = Rachel | last4 = Poteyeva | first4 = Margarita | last5 = Lanier | first5 = Christina | title = Violence against American Indian and Alaska native women and the criminal justice response: what is known | publisher = [[National Institute of Justice]] | url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=245615 | date = August 2008 | access-date = 10 May 2016}} {{NCJ|245615}} [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/223691.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, many reservations have become popular destinations for rapists and serial killers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gettys | first = Travis | title = Outsiders have been raping Native American women with ‘impunity’ — but legal loophole may finally close | url = https://www.rawstory.com/2015/04/outsiders-have-been-raping-native-american-women-with-impunity-but-legal-loophole-may-finally-close/ | work = [[The Raw Story]] | date = 6 April 2015 | access-date = 10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple versions of the Violence Against Women Act have attempted to address this issue, but these sections have often been removed from official versions of the act.

===Violence against immigrant and refugee women===
Immigrant and refugee women often face violence, both in the private sphere (by partners and other family members) and in the public sphere (by the police and other authorities). These women are often in a vulnerable position: they do not speak the language of the country they are in, they do not know its laws, and sometimes they are in a legal position where they may be deported if they make contact with the authorities. Women who seek protection from armed conflict in their countries of origin often face more violence while travelling to the destination country or when they arrive there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Freedman | first = Jane | title = Sexual and gender-based violence against refugee women: a hidden aspect of the refugee "crisis" | journal = [[Reproductive Health Matters]], special issue – Violence: A Barrier to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights | volume = 24 | issue = 47 | pages = 18&amp;ndash;26 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1016/j.rhm.2016.05.003 | pmid = 27578335 | date = 2017 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rhm.2016.05.003 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robbers | first1 = Gianna | last2 = Gunta | first2 = Lazdane | last3 = Dinesh | first3 = Sethi | title = Sexual violence against refugee women on the move to and within Europe | journal = [[Entre Nous (journal)|Entre Nous]], special issue: Together for a Better Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health | volume = 84 | pages = 26&amp;ndash;29 | publisher = [[WHO]]/Europe | date = 2016 | url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous/together-for-a-better-sexual-and-reproductive-health.-entre-nous-no-84,-2016 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/319301/Entre-Nous-84-full-book.pdf?ua=1 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport-related===

Sport-related violence against women refers to any physical, sexual, mental acts that are "perpetrated by both male athletes and by male fans or consumers of sport and sporting events, as well as by coaches of female athletes".&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Catherine|title=Violence against women and sport: Literature review|year=2011|publisher=Durham University|location=London|pages=2–5|url=http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/resources/22/violence-against-women-and-sport-a-literature-review-by-dr-catherine-palmer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106162130/http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/resources/22/violence-against-women-and-sport-a-literature-review-by-dr-catherine-palmer|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documenting reports and literature suggest that there are obvious connections between contemporary sport and violence against women. Such events as the [[2010 World Cup]], the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Commonwealth Games]] "have highlighted the connections between sports spectatorship and intimate partner violence, and the need for police, authorities and services to be aware of this when planning sporting events".&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer" /&gt;

Sport-related violence can occur in various contexts and places, including homes, pubs, clubs, hotel rooms, the streets.&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer" /&gt;

====Sport-related violence by male college athletes====

Violence against women is a topic of concern in the United States' collegiate athletic community.

====Controversy over contributing factors====

Sociologist Timothy Curry, after conducting an observational analysis of two big time sports' locker room conversations, deduced that the high risk of male student athletes for gender abuse is a result of the team's subculture.&lt;ref name=Curry1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=Timothy Jon|title=Fraternal Bonding in the Locker Room: A Profeminist Analysis Of Talk About Competition And Women|journal=Sociology of Sport Journal|year=1991|volume=8|issue=2|pages=119–135 |url=http://www.umt.edu/sociology/faculty_staff/ellestad/documents/275_Curry1991fraternalbondinginthelockerroom_s10.pdf |accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states, "Their locker room talk generally treated women as objects, encouraged sexist attitudes toward women and, in its extreme, promoted rape culture."&lt;ref name=Curry1991/&gt; He proposes that this objectification is a way for the male to reaffirm his heterosexual status and hyper-masculinity. Claims have been made that the atmosphere changes when an outsider (especially women) intrude in the locker room. In the wake of the reporter [[Lisa Olson]] being harassed by a Patriots player in the locker room in 1990, she reflected, "We are taught to think we must have done something wrong and it took me a while to realize I hadn't done anything wrong."&lt;ref name="Disch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Disch|first=Lisa|author2=Kane, Mary Jo |title=When a Looker is Really a Bitch: Lisa Olson, Sport, and the Heterosexual Matrix|journal=Signs|date=Winter 1996|volume=21|issue=2|pages=278–308|jstor=3175065|doi=10.1086/495067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other female sports reporters (college and professional) have claimed that they often brush off the players' comments, which leads to further objectification.&lt;ref name="Disch" /&gt; Other sociologists challenge this claim. Steve Chandler notes that because of their celebrity status on campus, "athletes are more likely to be scrutinized or falsely accused than non-athletes."&lt;ref name="chandler1999"/&gt; Another contender, Stephanie Mak, notes that, "if one considers the 1998 estimates that about three million women were battered and almost one million raped, the proportion of incidences that involve athletes in comparison to the regular population is relatively small."&lt;ref name="johnshopkins1"/&gt;

====Response to violence by male college athletes====

In response to the proposed link between college athletes and gender-based violence, and media coverage holding Universities as responsible for these scandals more universities are requiring athletes to attend workshops that promote awareness. For example, St. John's University holds sexual assault awareness classes in the fall for its incoming student athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newsom|first=John|title=Share on emailShare on redditMore Sharing Services Few Colleges Tackle Issue of Athlete Sex Assaults|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-22/news/mn-7249_1_sexual-assault|publisher=Los Angeles Times Online |date=22 March 1992 |accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups, such as the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes, have formed to provide support for the victims as their mission statement reads, "The NCAVA works to eliminate off the field violence by athletes through the implementation of prevention methods that recognize and promote the positive leadership potential of athletes within their communities.

===Cyberbullying===
[[Cyberbullying]] is a form of intimidation using electronic forms of contact. In the 21st century, cyberbullying has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers in Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Peter K. |last2=Mahdavi |first2=Jess |last3=Carvalho |first3=Manuel |last4=Fisher |first4=Sonja |last5=Russell |first5=Shanette |last6=Tippett |first6=Neil | title = Cyberbullying: its nature and impact in secondary school pupils | journal = [[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 376&amp;ndash;385 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01846.x | date = 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01846.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 2015, the [[United Nations Broadband Commission]] released a report that claimed that almost 75% percent of women [[online]] have encountered harassment and threats of violence, otherwise known as [[cyber violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2015/9/cyber-violence-report-press-release |title=cyber violence report press release |publisher=UN Women |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misogynistic rhetoric is prevalent online, and the public debate over gender-based attacks has increased significantly, leading to calls for policy interventions and better responses by social networks like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Jane |first= Emma Alice | title = 'Back to the kitchen, cunt': speaking the unspeakable about online misogyny  | journal = [[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]] | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 558&amp;ndash;570 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/10304312.2014.924479 | date = 2014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/10304312.2014.924479 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Filipovic |first= Jill | title = Blogging while female: how internet misogyny parallels real-world harassment | journal = [[Yale Journal of Law and Feminism]] | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 295&amp;ndash;303 | publisher = [[Yale Law School]] | date = 2007 | url = http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yjlf/vol19/iss1/10/ | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1268&amp;context=yjlf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background and history===
Activism refers to "a doctrine or practice that emphasizes direct vigorous action especially in support of or opposition to one side of a controversial issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/activism |title=Activism (definition) | website = merriam-webster.com |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |date= |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the activism for violence against women, the objectives are to address and draw public attention on the issues of VAW as well as seek and recommend measures to prevent and eliminate this violence.&lt;ref name="Youngs_368325"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Youngs | first = Gillian | title = Private pain/public peace: women’s rights as human rights and Amnesty International’s report on violence against women | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs]] | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 1209&amp;ndash;1229 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | doi = 10.1086/368325 | jstor = 10.1086/368325 | date = Summer 2003 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/368325 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholarly articles suggest that the VAW is considered as a violation of human rights&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Htun | first1 = Mala | last2 = Weldon | first2 = S.

In order to better comprehend the anti-violence movements against VAW, there is a need to also understand the generic historical background of [[feminist movements]] in a holistic manner. Talking about the international women's movement, many feminist scholars have categorized these movements into three waves&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kroløkke | first1 = Charlotte | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = Ann Scott | chapter = Three waves of feminism: from suffragettes to grrls | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IEhqiWR1Rt0C&amp;pg=PA1 | editor-last1 = Kroløkke | editor-first1 = Charlotte | editor-last2 = Sørensen | editor-first2 = Ann Scott | title = Gender communication theories &amp; analyses: from silence to performance | pages = 1&amp;ndash;23 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780761929185 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to their different beliefs, strategies and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rupp | first1 = Leila J. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Verta | title = Forging feminist identity in an international movement: a collective identity approach to twentieth-century feminism | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs]] | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 363&amp;ndash;386 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | doi = 10.1086/495344 | jstor = 3175646 | date = Winter 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/495344 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the first women's movements, or so called the [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] of feminism, dated back in the years the late 19th Century and early 20th Century in the United States and Europe. During this period, feminist movements developed from the context of industrialization and liberal politics that triggered the rise of feminist groups concerned with gaining equal access and opportunity for women.&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|1}} This wave marks a period of "[[Women's suffrage|suffrage]], independence, rights to nationality, work and [[Gender pay gap|equal pay]]" for women.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013"&gt;{{cite book | last = Prügl | first = Elisabeth (Lecturer) | title = Violence Against Women. Gender and International Affairs Class 2013 | url = http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/study/courses/courses-2017-2018/masters-interdisciplinaires/mia/ia039---gender-and-international.html | location = Geneva, Switzerland | publisher = Lecture conducted from [[The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] (IHEID) | date = 2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] of feminist movements was the series of movements from the period of the late 1960s to early 1970s. It was noted by feminist scholars that this wave could be characterized as a period of [[Women's liberation movement|women's liberation]] and the rise of a branch of feminism known as [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|7–8}} This wave of feminism emerged in the context of the postwar period&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|8}} in society where other mainstream movements also played a large role; for instance, the [[civil rights movements]],&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013" /&gt; which meant to condemn [[capitalism]], [[imperialism]] and the oppression of people based on the notions of [[Racism|race]], ethnicity, [[gender identity]] and [[LGBT social movements|sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|9}} This wave marks a period of equal rights at home and workplace as well as rights to development&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013" /&gt; for the purposes of people of different races, ethnicities, economic statuses and gender identities.

The [[Third-wave feminism|third wave]] of feminism is the newest wave of feminism led by young feminists whose understanding and context are of the [[Globalization|globalized]] world order and the technological advances that have come with it. Also, this wave is a transition of the fall communism&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|17}} to more complex issues of new kinds of 'warfare'{{Clarify|reason=What does this mean by "warfare"?  Also, this whole sentence is oddly worded but I don't understand what it's trying to say well enough to rewrite it.|date=November 2018}}, threats and violence. This new wave also "embraces ambiguity"&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|16}} and introduced a feminist approach of '[[intersectionality]]' that includes the issues of race, gender, age, and class.&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|17}} Other than that, the third wave marks a period of feminism dealing with [[identity politics]], body politics as well as the issues of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lind | first = Amy (Lecturer) | title = Gender and International Affairs 2013: International Feminist Movements | url = http://graduateinstitute.ch/directory?detail=people/faculty/lind | location = Geneva, Switzerland | publisher = Lecture conducted from [[The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] (IHEID) | date = 2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, the VAW movement was initiated in the 1970s where some feminist movements started to bring the discussion on the issue of violence into the feminist discourse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Eng | first = Phoebe | author-link = Phoebe Eng | title = Stopping the violence against women: the movement from intervention to prevention | url = http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Ms_StoppingVAWTheMovementFromInterventionToPrevention_Aug2005.pdf | format = pdf | page = 2 | publisher = [[Ms. Foundation for Women]] | location = New York | date = August 2005 | series = A Safety Program Report | access-date = 3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that many other groups, on the national as well as international levels, had attempted to push for the betterment of women through lobbying of the state officials and delegates, demanding the conferences on 'gender issues'&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013" /&gt; and thus made the VAW known to a wider range of population. Therefore, to put this into the theoretical context, VAW can be categorized along with the second and third waves of feminism which share a focus on violence.

VAW activist movements come in many forms, operating at international, national, and local levels&lt;ref name="Youngs_368325" /&gt; and utilizing different approaches based on health and human rights frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Alice M. | title = Sexuality, violence against women, and human rights: women make demands and ladies get protection | journal = [[Health and Human Rights]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 16&amp;ndash;47 | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/4065347 | jstor = 4065347 | date = 2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/4065347 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movements stemmed mostly from social movements and groups of women who see the need to create organizations to 'lobby' their governments to establish "sanctuaries, shelters" and provision of services that help protecting these victims, also called "battered women", from acts of violence. The term "battered women" was used in a number of VAW movements and had its root in the early stage of organizing efforts to tackle the problem of violence against women in many regions of the world such as Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin American and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|94}} The activist organizations against VAW, some with and the others without the support of their governments, attempted to develop "innovative efforts" to assist battered women by providing them services such as shelters and centers; drafting and lobbying governments to include the recognition and language of VAW into national legislations and [[international human rights instruments]]; advocating to raise the awareness of people via education and training sessions; forming national, regional as well as international networks to empower the movements; organizing demonstrations and gathering more efforts to end violent acts against women.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|88–89}} In addition, many women's rights activist groups see the issue of violence against women as a central focus of their movements. Many of these groups take a human rights approach as the integral framework of their activism. These VAW movements also employ the idea that "women's rights are human rights", transform the concepts and ideas of human rights, which are mostly reckoned to be "[[Western world|Western]] concepts" and '[[Vernacularization|vernacularize]] them into the concepts that can be understood in their local institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Merry | first = Sally Engle | title = Transnational human rights and local activism: mapping the middle | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 108 | issue = 1 | pages = 38&amp;ndash;51 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1525/aa.2006.108.1.38 | date = March 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1525/aa.2006.108.1.38 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}}

=== Levels of activist movements ===

On the local or national level, the VAW movements are diverse and differ in their strategic program of intervention. The strategies used in a number of the movements focus on the individual level with the emphases on individuals, relationships and family. Also, many of them take the 'preventive' as an approach to tackle the issues on the ground by encouraging people to "reexamine their attitudes and beliefs" in order to trigger and create fundamental changes in these "deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors".&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 95–109"/&gt; Despite the fact that these strategies can be life changing, helpful to those who participate and feasible over a long time frame, the effects on societal level seem to be restricted and of minimal effects. In order to achieve the objectives of the movement, many activists and scholars argue that they have to initiate changes in cultural attitudes and norms on a communal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heise | first1 = L. | last2 = Gottemoeller | first2 = M. | title = Ending violence against women | journal = Population Reports | volume = L | issue = 11 | page = 38 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Population and Information Program | url = https://vawnet.org/sites/default/files/assets/files/2016-10/PopulationReports.pdf | date = December 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of activism on the local level can be seen in South Africa. The movements of VAW in this context employ a strategy that is based on the 'prevention' approach, which is applicable on individual and societal levels: in families and communities. This movement encourages the individuals and small populations to rethink their attitudes and beliefs in order to create a possibility to alter these deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors, which lead to the acts of violence against women.&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"/&gt; Another example is the local level movement in East Africa that employs the prevention approach, which is applicable on a communal level. They call this a "raising voices" approach. This approach employs an 'ad hoc' framework that can be used alongside the individual approach where the strategy is to aggravate the status quo issues onto the individuals' and communities' perception and establish a common ground of interests for them to push for the movement, all in a short time period.&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"/&gt; In addition, on the domestic level, there seems to be many 'autonomous movements.'&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt; feminist movements (for VAW) can be understood as "a form of women's mobilization that is devoted to promoting women's status and well-being independently of political parties and other associations that do not have the status of women as their main concern".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;

A number of regions of the world have come together to address violence against women. In South America, the Southern Cone Network Against Domestic Violence has worked extensively to address sexual and domestic violence since 1989. The Latin American and Caribbean Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, formed in 1990, includes representation from twenty-one different countries and has been instrumental in increasing the visibility of VAW.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|88}} In September 1999, the Heads of States of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) met and drafted the "Prevention and Eradication of Violence Against Women and Children", a document condemning violence against women and children, and resolved a set of 13 methods of addressing it, reaching into the legal; social, economic, cultural, and political; social service; and education, training, and awareness building sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = SADC| title = The prevention and eradication of violence against women and children | journal = [[Review of African Political Economy]], special issue: Violence and Conflict Resolution in Africa | volume = 26 | issue = 81 | pages = 415&amp;ndash;417 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/03056249908704404 | jstor = 4006468 | date = September 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/03056249908704404 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the transnational or regional level, the anti-violence movements also deploy different strategies based on the specificities of their cultures and beliefs in their particular regions. On this level, the activist movements are known as "transnational feminist networks" or TFNs.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|556}} The TFNs have a significant effect, like the autonomous movements on the national level, in shaping sets of policies as well pushing for the recognition and inclusion of language of VAW in the United Nations human rights mechanisms: the international human rights agreements.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt; Their activities are ranging from lobbying the policy makers; organizing demonstrations on the local and regional levels; to creating institutional pressure that could push for changes in the international institutional measures.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;

On an international level, the movements that advocate for women's rights and against VAW are the mixture of (civil society) actors from domestic and regional levels. The objectives of these VAW movements focus on "creating shared expectations" within the domestic and regional levels as well as "mobilizing numbers of domestic civil society" to create "standards in global civil society".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|556}} The global women's movement works to transform numbers of international conventions and conferences to "a conference on women's rights" by pushing for a "stronger language and clearer recognition" of the VAW issues. In addition, the United Nations also plays a vital role in promoting and campaigning for the VAW movements on the international level. For instance, in 2008 UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-Moon]] initiated and launched a campaign called "[[UNiTE to End Violence against Women]]". This campaign "calls on governments, civil society, women's organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire UN system to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls".&lt;ref name="UNiTE_Orange"&gt;{{cite web | last = UNiTE | author-link = UNiTE to End Violence against Women | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131220093826/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action | archive-date = 20 December 2013 |url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action |title=Take action to Orange your day |publisher=[[UN Women]] |date= 2013 | accessdate = 20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this campaign also announces every 25th of the month to be "Orange Day" or "a day to take action to raise awareness and prevent violence against women and girls".&lt;ref name="UNiTE_Orange" /&gt;

In conclusion, each level of activism is intertwined and has the common purpose to end violence against women. Activism on local levels can significantly affect national, transnational, and international levels as well. In a scholarly article on ''Combating Violence Against Women'', the authors illustrated from their research analysis on how the norms of international society can shape and influence policy making on the domestic or national level and vice versa. They argue that there are three mechanisms which have effects on the making of national policies as well as global agreements and conventions: "1) the influence of global treaties and documents such as [[CEDAW]] on women's rights" - on the national policies "2) the influence of regional agreements on VAW (particularly after certain tipping points are reached)" - on both domestic policies and international conventions and "3) regional demonstration effects or pressure for conformity captured as diffusion within regions" - on the international norms and agreements.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;

** The [[Council of Europe]] also developed "a series of initiatives" related to the issue of VAW: "the 2000 resolution on trafficking, the 2003 resolution on domestic violence, and the 2004 resolution on honor crimes" as well as promoted "the 2002 recommendation on the protection of women against violence and established its monitoring framework".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|557}}

==Access to justice for female victims of violence==

===International and regional instruments===
Efforts to fight violence against women can take many forms and access to justice, or lack thereof, for such violence varies greatly depending on the justice system. International and regional instruments are increasingly used as the basis for national legislation and policies to eradicate violence against women.

The Inter-American Convention to Prevent, Eradicate and Punish Violence Against Women – also known as the Belém do Parà Convention, for instance, has been applied by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in its first case of domestic violence to condemn Brazil in the Maria da Penha case. This led the Brazilian government to enact in 2006 the Maria da Penha Law, the country's first law against domestic violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spieler | first = Paula | title = The Maria da Penha Case and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights: contributions to the debate on domestic violence against women in Brazil | journal = [[Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 121&amp;ndash;143 | publisher = [[Indiana University Maurer School of Law]] | date = Winter 2011 | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/445824 | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also, for instance, the South Asian Agreement on Regional Cooperation's (SAARC) Protocol to End Trafficking in Women and Children.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

===Examples of measures put in place===
As violence is often committed by a family member, women first started by lobbying their governments to set up shelters for domestic violence survivors. The Julia Burgos Protected House established in Puerto Rico in 1979 was the first shelter in Latin America and the Caribbean for "battered women". In 2003, 18 out of the 20 countries in the region had legislation on domestic or family violence, and 11 countries addressed sexual violence in their laws. Legislative measures to protect victims can include restraining orders, which can be found in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Venezuela, Turkey, the United States and many western European countries for instance.

Courts can also be allowed by law (Germany, 2001) to order the perpetrator to leave the home so that victims do not have to seek shelter. Countries were urged to repeal discriminatory legislation by 2005 following the review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 2000. Egypt, for instance, abolished a law that exempted men from rape charges when marrying their victims. However, the goal of antiviolence legislation is often to keep the families together, regardless of the best interests of women, which perpetuate domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

Innovative measures have been pioneered in a number of countries to end violence against women. In Brazil and Jordan, [[women's police stations]] have been introduced, and one-stop [[women's shelter]]s were created in Malaysia and Nicaragua.

[[Marital rape]] has been illegal in every American state and the District of Columbia since 1993, but is rarely prosecuted in America.&lt;ref name="rainn.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Marital rape | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131201082952/http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape | archive-date = 1 December 2013 |url=http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape |website=rainn.org | publisher = [[Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network]] (RAINN) |date= |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[UN General Assembly]] passed its first resolution calling for the protection of defenders of women's human rights.&lt;ref name="Norway Post" /&gt; The resolution urges states to put in place gender-specific laws and policies for the protection of women's human rights defenders and to ensure that defenders themselves are involved in the design and implementation of these measures, and calls on states to protect women's human rights defenders from reprisals for cooperating with the UN and to ensure their unhindered access to and communication with international human rights bodies and mechanisms.&lt;ref name="awid.org"/&gt;

=== Challenges faced by women in accessing justice and limitations of measures ===
There can be a de jure or de facto acceptance of violent behaviors and lack of remedies for victims.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

*'''Lack of criminalization:''' in many places, acts of abuse, especially acts such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[marital rape]], [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]], are not criminalized, or are illegal but widely tolerated, with the laws against them being rarely enforced. There are instances where crimes against women are also categorized as minor offenses.

*'''Lack of awareness of the existing laws:''' in many places, although there are laws against violence on the books, many women do not know of their existence. This is especially the case with marital rape - its criminalization being very recent in most countries.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

*'''Challenges in making a case in court:''' the burden of proof can be placed on the victim. For instance in the Philippines, before a change in law in 1997, rape used to be described as a crime against chastity; and virginity played an important role in court. In various countries, such as [[Bangladesh]], a woman's past sexual experience continues to be very important in a case of rape. Bangladesh has received criticism for its employment of the "two-finger test" in rape investigations. This test consists in a physical examination of women who report rape during which a doctor inserts two fingers in the woman's vagina to determine whether the woman is "habituated to sex". This examination has its origin in the country's British colonial-era laws dating back to 1872. This deters many women from reporting rape. More than 100 experts, including doctors, lawyers, police, and women's rights activists had signed a joint statement in 2013 asking for the test, which they called "demeaning", to be abolished, as it "does not provide any evidence that is relevant to proving the offence". This test is also performed in several other countries in the region, including India.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

On the other hand, there are measures, such as the 2012 law in Brazil, that allow for cases to be filed even without the representation of the victim.

*'''Existing laws are insufficient, conflicting, and have no effect in practice:''' some laws on domestic violence, for instance, conflict with other provisions and ultimately contradict their goals. Legal frameworks can also be flawed when laws that integrate protection do so in isolation, notably in relation to immigration laws. Undocumented women in countries where they would have, in theory, access to justice, don't in practice for fear of being denounced and deported. The CEDAW Committee recommends that a State authority's obligation to report undocumented persons be repealed in national legislation.

*'''The attitude of the police:''' women who report acts of violence most often come into contact first with police workers. Therefore, police attitudes are crucial in facilitating a sense of safety and comfort for women who have been victimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Logan | first1 = T.

Measures to address violence against women range from access to legal-aid to the provision of shelters and hotlines for victims. Despite advances in legislation and policies, the lack of implementation of the measures put in place prevents significant progress in eradicating violence against women globally. This failure to apply existing laws and procedures is often due to the persisting issue of gender stereotyping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = CEDAW | author-link = CEDAW | title = General discussion on women and access to justice | url = http://wilpf.org/cedaw-general-discussion-on-women-and-access-to-justice/ | publisher = [[United Nations]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | date = 18 February 2013 | accessdate = 12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The legal rights of access that married partners have to each other's persons, property, and lives makes it all but impossible for a spouse to defend herself (or himself), or to be protected against torture, rape, battery, stalking, mayhem, or murder by the other spouse...

==Istanbul Convention==
The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, is the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of domestic violence and violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bureau des Traités |url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG |title=Liste complète |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Countries which ratify it must ensure that the forms of violence defined in its text are outlawed. In its Preamble, the Convention states that "the realisation of ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' equality between women and men is a key element in the prevention of violence against women". The Convention also provides a definition of [[domestic violence]] as "all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence that occur within the family or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or partners, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim".&lt;ref name="Istanbul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Council of Europe – Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|work=coe.int|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is a Convention of the [[Council of Europe]], it is open to accession by any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221131635/http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21586">A '''wildland–urban interface''' (or WUI) is a zone of transition between unoccupied land and human development. Communities that are within {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} of the zone may also be included.  These lands and communities adjacent to and surrounded by [[wildland]]s are at risk of [[wildfire]]s.

==Definitions==
[[File:Wildland Urban Interface Catalonia.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the wildland-urban interface in Catalonia featuring intermix and interface zones.]]
The [[US Forest Service]] defines the wildland-urban interface as the place where "homes and wildlands meet or intermingle", or more specifically, where "humans and their development meet or intermix with wildland fuel".&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Susan M.|last2=Comas|first2=Sara J.|last3=Menakis|first3=James P.|last4=Steward|first4=Susan I.|last5=Cleveland|first5=Helene|last6=Bramwell|first6=Lincoln|last7=Radeloff|first7=Volker|title=Wildfire, Wildlands, and People: Understanding and Preparing for Wildfire in the Wildland-Urban Interface|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/openspace/fote/reports/GTR-299.pdf|website=USDA Forest Service|publisher=USDA|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more quantitative definition is provided by the [[Federal Register]], which defines WUI areas as those containing at least one housing unit per 40 acres. Federal Register definitions can be combined with quantitative criteria to classify the WUI into two categories:

* Intermix WUI, or lands that contain at least one housing unit per 40 acres in which vegetation occupies at least 50% of terrestrial area, and
* Interface WUI, or lands that contain at least one housing unit per 40 acres, contain less than 50% vegetation, and lie within 2.4 km of a heavily vegetated area.
** A "heavily vegetated area" is defined as an area containing over 75% wildlife vegetation and occupies at least 5 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of terrestrial area.

The main difference between these types of WUI are that homes in intermix WUI are interspersed with vegetation, whereas homes in interface WUI are adjacent to heavy vegetation.&lt;ref name="Radeloff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radeloff|first1=V.

==WUI growth and causes==

From 1990 to 2000, WUI area in the United States increased by 18 percent, covering 6 million additional homes. As of 2013, it was reported that the number of wildfires in the United States exceeding 50,000 acres had been steadily increasing since 1983, with the bulk of the change occurring from 2003 to 2013. The intensity of these fires was found to be increasing as well, contributing to an observed increase in costs related to reducing fire risks, fighting wildfires, and protecting property.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; WUI growth has also been noted in other places throughout the world, including Argentina, France, South Africa, Australia, and Mediterranean regions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SYPHARD|first=ALEXANDRA D.|last2=RADELOFF|first2=VOLKER C.|last3=HAWBAKER|first3=TODD J.|last4=STEWART|first4=SUSAN I.|date=January 16, 2009|title=Conservation Threats Due to Human-Caused Increases in Fire Frequency in Mediterranean-Climate Ecosystems|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01223.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=758–769|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01223.x|issn=0888-8892|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radeloff|first=Volker C.|last2=Helmers|first2=David P.|last3=Kramer|first3=H.

===Population shifts===
Factors behind WUI growth include population growth, housing growth in wildland areas, population shifts, and the expansion of cities into wildlands. In the United States, WUI growth is partially attributed to population shifts towards the West and South. Additionally, as of 2013, the migration of retiring [[baby-boomers]] to smaller communities closer to scenic natural resources (“amenity migration”) is expected to contribute to WUI growth as well.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 2010, the WUI was the fastest-growing land use type in the United States, and 97% of new WUI areas were the result of new housing rather than increases in wildlife vegetation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Ecological factors===

Keane, et al. attribute the increase in WUI area to ecological factors such as climate change, insect pests, and diseases, which have resulted in more arid and flammable landscapes.&lt;ref name="Keane Eco"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keane|first1=Robert E.|last2=Agee|first2=James K.|last3=Fulé|first3=Peter|last4=Keeley|first4=Jon E.|last5=Key|first5=Carl|last6=Kitchen|first6=Stanley G.|last7=Miller|first7=Richard|last8=Schulte|first8=Lisa A.|title=Ecological effects of large fires on US landscapes: benefit or catastrophe?|journal=International Journal of Wildland Fire|date=2008|volume=17|pages=696-712|url=http://oregonstate.edu/dept/eoarc/sites/default/files/publication/617.pdf|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change can result in significant shifts in wildlife composition due to changes in temperature and precipitation.&lt;ref name="Keane Climate"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keane|first1=Robert E.|last2=Holsinger|first2=Lisa M.|last3=Parsons|first3=Russell A.|last4=Gray|first4=Kathy|date=2008|title=Climate change effects on historical range and variability of two large landscapes in western Montana, USA|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2008_keane_r001.pdf|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=254|pages=375-389|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population shifts can result in unintended ecological consequences resulting in higher landscape flammability. For example, flammable materials present in housing serve as a direct means of wildfire spread, while landscaping can cause non-native species to spread.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To a small degree, vegetation growth into or near settled areas can lead to WUI growth. Between 1990 and 2010, vegetation growth accounted for 3% of all WUI growth in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Impact on environment ===
Environmental issues related to WUI growth extend beyond the increased risk of wildfire damage to human settlements. For example, housing growth in WUI regions can displace and fragment native vegetation. Additionally, the introduction of non-native species by humans through landscaping can change the wildlife composition of interface regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other factors can also have impacts on the environment, including pets which can kill large quantities of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loss|first=Scott R.|last2=Will|first2=Tom|last3=Marra|first3=Peter P.|date=2013-01-29|title=The impact of free-ranging domestic cats on wildlife of the United States|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2380|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.1038/ncomms2380|issn=2041-1723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest fragmentation is another impact of WUI growth, which can lead to unintended ecological consequences. For instance, increased forest fragmentation can lead to an increase in the prevalence of Lyme disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownstein|first=John S.|last2=Skelly|first2=David K.|last3=Holford|first3=Theodore R.|last4=Fish|first4=Durland|date=2005-09-27|title=Forest fragmentation predicts local scale heterogeneity of Lyme disease risk|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00442-005-0251-9|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=146|issue=3|pages=469–475|doi=10.1007/s00442-005-0251-9|issn=0029-8549}}&lt;/ref&gt; One possible reason for this effect is the production of high-density isolated populations of transmission vectors such as ticks and mice. Isolated forest patches in fragmented environments tend to be surrounded by unfavorable habitats, which hinders the dispersal of infected species and increases their local density. Additionally, disease vectors in isolated patches can undergo genetic differentiation, increasing their survivability as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Julie A.|last2=Marrotte|first2=Robby R.|last3=Desrosiers|first3=Nathalie|last4=Fiset|first4=Jessica|last5=Gaitan|first5=Jorge|last6=Gonzalez|first6=Andrew|last7=Koffi|first7=Jules K.|last8=Lapointe|first8=Francois-Joseph|last9=Leighton|first9=Patrick A.|date=2014-05-07|title=Climate change and habitat fragmentation drive the occurrence ofBorrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, at the northeastern limit of its distribution|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/eva.12165|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=7|issue=7|pages=750–764|doi=10.1111/eva.12165|issn=1752-4571|pmc=4227856|pmid=25469157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increases in wildfire risk pose a threat to conservation in WUI growth regions. Between 1985-94 and 2005-14, the area burned by wildfires in the United States nearly doubled from 18,000 to 33,000 square kilometers, and this increase can partly be attributed to WUI growth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In North America, Chile, and Australia, unnaturally high fire frequencies have resulted in incidences of exotic annual grasses replacing native shrublands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Wildfire Risk Assessment==

As of 2013, 32 percent of homes, apartments, and other human dwellings in the United States are contained within the WUI, and this figure is expected to grow over time. Wildfires can pose a risk to any area containing vegetation, as embers transported by wind can ignite fires a mile or more away from a flame front.&lt;ref name="USDAFS" /&gt; The increase in wildfire prevalence in the United States between 1985-94 and 2005-14 resulted in a tripling of federal wildfire suppression expenditures from $0.4 billion per year to $1.4 billion per year, indicating that wildfires pose a potent economic risk to communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Identification of high-risk areas===
Geospatial quantification of wildfire risk can highlight key areas for policy and emergency response planning. Several factors are used to assess the threat wildfires pose to human settlements. These factors can mainly be divided into ecological factors (e.g. climate, seasonal weather patterns, and vegetation) and human factors (e.g. arrangement and density of housing). Quantitative risk assessments can be produced by combining data such as the probability of large wildfires, estimated wildfire intensity, population density, and the proximity of human settlements to roads. One approach, used by Haas et al., combines geographical data on population density and probability of exposure to a large wildfire to produce maps that highlight spatial variability in wildfire risk. The highest-risk areas identified by this method are those where moderate population levels overlap with or are adjacent to wildlands with high chances of wildfire exposure.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=Jessica R.|last2=Calkin|first2=David E.|last3=Thompson|first3=Matthew P.|date=2013|title=A national approach for integrating wildfire simulation modeling into Wildland Urban Interface risk assessments within the United States|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2013_haas_j001.pdf|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|volume=119|pages=44-53|doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.06.011|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effect of population density on wildfire risk ====
Population density correlates with wildfire risk for two main reasons. First, people can cause fires; from 2001 to 2011, 85% of wildfires recorded by National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) were caused by people. Second, housing can intensify wildfires because they can potentially contain highly flammable material such wood shakes, and can be a source for mobile embers which can cause wildfires to spread.&lt;ref name="USDAFS" /&gt;

The relationship between population density and wildfire risk is non-linear. At low population densities, human ignitions are low, and ignitions increase with population density. However, in a range of environments sampled from North America, the Mediterranean Basin, Chile, and South Africa, a threshold of population density was observed at which fire occurrence decreased. Possible reasons for this decrease include decreases in open space for ember transmission, fuel fragmentation due to urban development, and higher availability of fire-suppression resources. For this reason, areas with moderate population densities tend to exhibit higher wildfire risk than areas with low or high population densities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Wildfire simulation modeling===
Some factors typically used in wildfire simulations include historical spatial wildfire data, geographic features, geographical distributions of vegetation, and climate.&lt;ref name="Keane Climate" /&gt; One algorithm commonly used to simulate wildfire spread are Minimum Travel Time (MTT) algorithms.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to MTT algorithms, fire boundaries were primarily modeled through the application of [[Huygens–Fresnel principle|Huygens' principle]] by treating boundaries as wave fronts on a two-dimensional surface. MTT algorithms are capable of calculating fire perimeters in a nearly-equivalent way finding the minimum time it takes for a fire to travel between two points, and are advantageous due to their speed and scalability. However, MTT methods come at the cost of assuming nearly-constant environmental conditions such as wind direction and fuel moisture dynamics, and thus tend to be more apt for short-timescale simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finney|first=Mark A|date=August 2002|title=Fire growth using minimum travel time methods|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/x02-068|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=32|issue=8|pages=1420–1424|doi=10.1139/x02-068|issn=0045-5067|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk Management==
The vulnerability of a community to wildfires is partly determined by its decisions regarding land use, building standards, and landscaping choices. Community-focused risk management efforts often focused on reducing the flammability of dwellings and wildland vegetation in and around high-risk areas.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution of responsibilities ===
[[File:Fire Adapted Communities infographic.jpg|thumb|287x287px|By distributing wildfire management responsibilities, communities can mitigate risks.]]
Calkin, et al. present a conceptual framework for risk mitigation in the WUI. In this model, two major objectives that lead to decreased home loss are (a) reducing the probability of home exposure to wildfires and (b) reducing the susceptibility of houses to wildfire loss. The former can be split into three actionable objectives: reducing wildfire occurrence, reducing wildfire size and intensity, and reducing human development in fire-prone areas. The latter can be converted into a single actionable objective, i.e. increasing home resistance to ignition. In the framework, responsibility for actions is attributed to three major groups: land management agencies, local governments, and homeowners. Land management agencies can help reduce wildfire occurrence through ignition prevention, and can help reduce wildfire size and intensity through fuel and vegetation management, building community preparedness, and responding to wildfires with suppression efforts. Local governments can help reduce human development in fire-proof areas through proper land use management and zoning. Individual homeowners can also reduce the risk of home loss by taking action to manage the flammability of their homes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calkin|first=David E.|last2=Cohen|first2=Jack D.|last3=Finney|first3=Mark A.|last4=Thompson|first4=Matthew P.|date=2014-01-14|title=How risk management can prevent future wildfire disasters in the wildland-urban interface|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1315088111|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=2|pages=746–751|doi=10.1073/pnas.1315088111|pmc=3896199|pmid=24344292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Community response ====
{{See also|Fire-adapted communities}}
One approach to mitigating fire risk is adapting communities to adapt to fire risks rather than escalate prevention efforts. Fire-adapted communities are defined by the United States Forest Service as "a knowledgeable and engaged community in which the awareness and actions of residents regarding infrastructure, buildings, landscaping, and the surrounding ecosystem lessens the need for extensive protection actions and enables the community to safely accept fire as a part of the surrounding landscape." Fostering the development of a fire-adapted community can help save resources for local and federal governments by reducing the amount of resources needed for fire mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/fire/prev_ed/fac/faqs.pdf|title=Frequently Asked Questions – Fire Adapted Communities|last=|first=|date=July 10, 2014|website=USDA Forest Service Fire and Aviation Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001135211/https://www.fs.fed.us/fire/prev_ed/fac/faqs.pdf|archive-date=October 1, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ways homeowners can reduce risk ===
The susceptibility of a home to ignition is determined by its home ignition zone (HIZ), or the home and its surrounding area up to 100-200 feet. Individual homeowners can use the following guidelines to determine what areas of their home can be improved to mitigate fire risk:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dnr.wi.gov/files/pdf/pubs/fr/fr0474.pdf|title=Home Ignition Zone Self Assessment for Homeowners|last=|first=|date=2011|website=Firewise Wisconsin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430183553/https://dnr.wi.gov/files/pdf/pubs/fr/fr0474.pdf|archive-date=April 30, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** Enclose eaves and vents with wire mesh.
** Ensure that decks and porches are made of fire-resistant materials.
* Guidelines for landscaping:
** Keep vegetation away from windows, as windows can break during a fire and let in embers.
** Ensure plants within 3-5 feet of the home are low-growing, well-maintained and [[deciduous]].
** Keep bare dirt, mowed grass, or non-combustible mulch in a "no-grow" zone within 3-5 feet of the home.
** Limit the presence of evergreens (which are highly flammable) within 30 feet of the home.
** Keep vegetation thin within 30 to 100 feet of the home.
* Guidelines for outdoor maintenance:
** Trim back tree limbs at least 10 feet from roof.
** Ensure power lines are away from tree branches and nearby dead or dying trees.
** Clean off fallen leaves, pine needles, and other debris from roof, gutters, window wells, and underneath decks.
** Prune tree branches 6 feet up from ground (especially [[Evergreen|evergreens]]).
** Keep lawn mowed, green, and free of leaf litter and needles.
** Ensure yard is free of dead trees and shrubs.
* Ways to keep flammables at a safe distance:
** Ensure outbuildings within 30 feet of homes or other buildings are clear of flammables.
** Store firewood and other flammable materials at least 30 feet from buildings.
** Clear the area 10 feet surrounding propane tanks or fuel oil tanks.

=== Challenges to risk management ===
Wildfires are an ecological process that naturally contribute to the development of ecosystems, and many wildlands are historically predisposed to periodic fire. Because of this, complete eradication of fires in WUI regions is typically not feasible. Additionally, wildfires are capable of spreading through far distances, presenting logistical challenges to wildfire management efforts. At a governmental level, communities that have developed within or near fire-prone areas typically vary widely in terms of wildfire risk and preparedness, which can confound coordination efforts. Lastly, a mismatch between the reality of wildfire risk and sociopolitical expectations of wildland fire management services may lead to challenges to strategic risk management.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1928">'''Yi''', ({{zh|c=義|s=义|t=義|p=yì|tp=|j=Ji6|zhu=ㄧˋ|links=No|Phonetic=ㄧˋ}}), literally "[[justice]], [[righteousness]]; [[meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]]," is an important concept in [[Confucianism]]. It involves a moral disposition to do [[good]], and also the intuition and sensibility to do so competently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/oriental/main.html |title=The Main Concepts of Confucianism |publisher=Philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Cheng)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yi'' resonates with Confucian philosophy's orientation towards the cultivation of benevolence (''ren'') and skillful practice (''li'').

''Yi'' represents moral acumen which goes beyond simple rule following, and involves a balanced understanding of a situation, and the "creative insights" necessary to apply [[virtue|virtues]] "with no loss of sight of the total good. ''Yi'' represents this ideal of totality as well as a decision-generating ability to apply a virtue properly and appropriately in a situation." &lt;ref&gt;(Cheng p. 271)&lt;/ref&gt;

In application, ''yi'' is a "complex principle" which includes:

# skill in crafting actions which have moral fitness according to a given concrete situation
# the wise recognition of such fitness
# the intrinsic satisfaction that comes from that recognition.&lt;ref&gt;(Cheng)&lt;/ref&gt;
