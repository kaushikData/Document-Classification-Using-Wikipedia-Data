== Regulations ==

Germany's Animal Welfare Act creates an offence of willfully or negligently inflicting substantial pain, suffering, or injury to an animal without reasonable cause.  The Act specifies a list of prohibited acts, including overloading, training using significant pain, suffering or damage, abandonment, and force-feeding other than for health reasons.  "Animal" is not defined in the Act, but the Act references vertebrates, warm-blooded animals, fish, cold-blooded animals, amphibians, reptiles, and [[cephalopod]]s.&lt;ref name="wap" /&gt;

The Act's duty of care and anti-cruelty requirements apply to farmed animals.  Particularly relevant are the prohibitions on force-feeding and the use of devices which significantly limit the species-specific behavior of an animal.  The Act requires stunning of warm-blooded animals before slaughter, with an exemption for religious slaughter.  The Act gives powers to the Ministry of Food and Agriculture to make secondary regulations on issues such as accommodation, training, [[Livestock transportation|transport]], and slaughter.  Secondary regulations also include the incorporation of European Union legislation on farm animal welfare.&lt;ref name="wap" /&gt;

Regarding the use of animals in science, the Act encompasses elements of [[The Three Rs (animals)|The Three Rs]] principles (''replace'' the use of animals in research where possible, ''reduce'' the number of animals used, and ''refine'' methods to minimize pain, suffering, or distress).  Facilities which test on vertebrates and cephalopods are required to have an Animal Welfare Officer.&lt;ref name="wap" /&gt;

In 2002 the German Constitution was amended to include the protection of animals as a state goal.&lt;ref name="wap" /&gt;

In 2014 Germany received a B out of possible grades A,B,C,D,E,F,G on [[World Animal Protection]]'s Animal Protection Index.&lt;ref name="wap" /&gt;

== Animals used for food ==
=== Animal agriculture ===

The German poultry industry consists of approximately 34 million laying hens, 60 million [[broiler]]s, and 11 million turkeys.  There are around 12.9 million head of cattle in total, including dairy cows and suckler cows.&lt;ref name="livestock"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.germanlivestock.de/ |title=German Livestock |accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 Germany had Europe's largest pig population at over 27.4 million.&lt;ref name="pigpop"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/3951/eu-pig-population-2011/ |title=EU Pig Population - 2011 |date=May 11, 2012 |accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a German court ruled that [[chick culling]], in which male chicks are killed by being gassed or ground alive, does not violate animal protection laws.  Several million chicks are killed by these methods in Germany each year.&lt;ref name="henderson"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/german-court-rules-killing-day-old-live-male-chicks-does-not-contravene-their-animal-rights-a7047591.html |title=German court rules killing day-old live male chicks does not contravene their animal rights |author=Emma Henderson |date=May 25, 2016 |accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Veganism ===

A 2009 survey found that 9% of German respondents identified as [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]].&lt;ref name=EuroVegGermany&gt;{{cite web|title=How many Veggies ... ? |publisher=[[European Vegetarian Union]] |url=http://www.euroveg.eu/lang/en/info/howmany.php |accessdate=17 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301212618/http://www.euroveg.eu/lang/en/info/howmany.php |archivedate=1 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Data on the prevalence of [[veganism]] is not available.

== Animals used in research ==
In 2016, 2.19 million procedures were performed on animals in research.  When animals killed for tissues or organs (but not undergoing any prior procedure) are included the number of animals is just under 2.80 million. The number of animals rose steadily from around 1.8 million in 2000 to over 3 million in 2014, before coming back down below 3 million.  In 2016, 61% of procedures were classified as mild, 23% as moderate, 5% as severe, and 11% as non-recovery (in which the animal is anaesthetised and never woken up).&lt;ref name="research"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://speakingofresearch.com/facts/animal-research-statistics/german-animal-research-statistics/ |title=German Animal Research Statistics |author=Speaking of Research |accessdate=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, animal activists released graphic undercover footage of monkeys being used for brain research in Germany, provoking a public outcry.  The monkeys in the video were bloodied, obviously distressed, and some were left in cages without food or water to make them compliant with the experimental procedures.&lt;ref name="Harress"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/animal-rights-undercover-footage-shows-monkey-brain-experiments-germany-1687754 |title=Animal Rights: Undercover Footage Shows Monkey Brain Experiments In Germany |author=Christopher Harress |date=September 12, 2014 |accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 German opinion poll found that 89% of Germans agreed that the European Union protection laws should forbid all animal testing that causes pain and suffering.&lt;ref name="Dillon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.com/en/animal-testing-at-odds-with-german-public-opinion/a-18431227 |title=Animal testing at odds with German public opinion |date=June 5, 2015 |author=Conor Dillon |accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animal activism ==

The [[Albert Schweitzer Foundation for Our Contemporaries|Albert Schweitzer Foundation for Our Contemporaries (ASF)]] is a German animal non-profit focused on helping farmed animals through corporate outreach campaigns to adopt higher-welfare policies (e.g. cage-free eggs), vegan outreach, and other activities.  As of 2016 it is one of Animal Charity Evaluators' Standout Charities.&lt;ref name="asf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/organizations/albert-schweitzer-foundation-review/ |title=Albert Schweitzer Foundation Review |author=Animal Charity Evaluators |date=May 4, 2016 |accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOKO Tierschutz is a German animal rights organization which conducts undercover investigations of farms and animal research laboratories.  In December 2014, SOKO Tierschutz organized around 800 people to protest against research on non-human primates in Germany.&lt;ref name="abbott"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/animal-rights-activists-ramp-up-campaigns-in-europe-1.16637 |title=Animal-rights activists ramp up campaigns in Europe |author=Alison Abbott |date=December 22, 2014 |accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anonymous works''' are works, such as [[art]] or [[literature]], that have an [[Anonymity|anonymous]], undisclosed, or unknown creator or author. In the case of very old works, the author's name may simply be lost over the course of history and time. There are a number of reasons anonymous works arise.

== Description ==
In the [[United States]], anonymous work is legally defined as "a work on the copies or [[phonorecord]]s of which no [[natural person]] is identified as [[author]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property/library/copyrightact.html|title=Selected Sections of the Copyright Act|date=1997-12-17|accessdate=2008-06-22|work=UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511185159/http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property/library/copyrightact.html|archivedate=11 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations ==
In the case of very old works, the author's name may simply be lost over the course of history and time. In such cases the author is often referred to as [[Wikt:anonymus|Anonymus]], the [[Latin]]  form of "anonymous". In other cases, the creator's name is intentionally kept secret. The author's reasons may vary from fear of [[persecution]] to protection of his or her reputation.  Legal reasons may also bar an author from self-identifying, as in 2007, when ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published an article by an anonymous author—who would have preferred to be named—describing the use of [[national security letters]] by the [[FBI]].{{cn|date=August 2013}}

'''Arthur Linton Corbin''' (October 17, 1874 – May 1, 1967) was a professor at [[Yale Law School]] and a scholar of [[contract]] law.  He helped to develop the [[Jurisprudence|philosophy of law]] known as [[legal realism]],&lt;ref name="Yalecorbin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.yale.edu/cbl/3075.htm |title=Early Years, 1869-1916: Arthur L.

==Early life==
Corbin was born in [[Linn County, Kansas]], on October 17, 1874.&lt;ref name="Corbin68"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Arthur Linton |last1=Corbin  |volume=13 |journal=[[Kansas Law Review]] |page=183 |title=Sixty-Eight Years at Law {{mdash}} Faculty Scholarship Series.

Following graduation from Yale, he practiced law in [[Cripple Creek, Colorado]]. Corbin returned to [[Yale Law School]] in 1903 to serve as an instructor in contract law.

==Career at Yale==
Corbin became a full professor at Yale Law School in 1909, a position he would hold until his retirement from teaching in 1943.&lt;ref name="Yalecorbin"/&gt;  During his time at Yale, he was strongly influential in turning the law school into the center of legal scholarship it is known for today.  He convinced the administration to hire more full-time professors and enact more selective admission criteria, and helped to implement and popularize the [[casebook method]] of legal study created by [[Christopher Columbus Langdell]] at [[Harvard Law School]].

He was a founder of the [[American Law Institute]] and the first reporter of the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]].&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;

==Scholarship and writings==
Corbin wrote extensively in the field of contract law.  His most famous work was the treatise ''Corbin on Contracts: A Comprehensive Treatise on the Working Rules of Contracts Law,'' the original version of which was eight volumes long and appeared in 1950 (though it has since been expanded).&lt;ref name="jrank"&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/5747/Corbin-Arthur-Linton.html Entry on Corbin from Thompson-Gale legal encyclopedia, courtesy of Jrank]&lt;/ref&gt;  This treatise is still used today in [[Law school in the United States|American law schools]] and cited in [[law journals]] and [[judicial opinion]]s.&lt;ref name="Yalecorbin"/&gt;

Corbin subscribed to the philosophy of [[legal realism]], the idea that law was the product of human efforts and society.  He believed that in resolving contract disputes, [[judge]]s should examine not just the "four corners" of the legal document itself, but the intention of the [[Party (law)|parties]], as evidenced by the [[course of dealing]] and [[course of performance]] between the parties, as well as the customs of the trade and business community.  Corbin felt that the main purpose of a contract was to protect the reasonable expectations of each party.

Corbin's views are frequently contrasted with those of Harvard contracts scholar [[Samuel Williston]], who was more of a [[Legal formalism|formalist]] in his thinking.&lt;ref name="Linzer"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Peter |last1=Linzer |title=The Comfort of Certainty: Plain Meaning and the Parole Evidence Rule |volume=71 |journal=[[Fordham Law Review]] |page=799 |year=2002 |url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol71/iss3/8 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Williston served as the reporter for the [[Restatement of the Law|First Restatement of Contracts]], but Corbin's contributions were more evident in the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]],&lt;ref name="Yalecorbin"/&gt; which he worked on until his retirement from legal study at age 90, due to failing eyesight.  Corbin died at age 92, in 1967.

Corbin's scholarship heavily influenced the drafters of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], particularly the work of [[Karl Llewellyn]], who had previously studied under Corbin.

His portrait is in the Yale Law School collection.&lt;ref name="Yalecorbin"/&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union}}
'''Article 7 of the [[Treaty on European Union]]''' is a procedure in the [[treaties of the European Union|treaties]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) to suspend certain rights from a [[member state of the European Union|member state]]. While rights can be suspended, there is no mechanism to expel a member.

The procedure is covered by [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions#Article 7|TEU Article 7]]. It would be enacted where the EU identifies a member persistently breaching the EU's founding values (respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities), as outlined in [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions#Article 2|TEU Article 2]].

The [[European Council]] can vote to suspend any rights of membership, such as voting and representation as outlined above. Identifying the breach requires [[unanimity]] (excluding the state concerned), but sanctions require only a qualified majority.&lt;ref name="suspend"&gt;[http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/suspension_clause_en.htm Suspension clause], Europa glossary, accessed 1 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The state in question would still be bound by the obligations treaties, and the Council acting by majority may alter or lift such sanctions.

==Background==

|title = Article 7
|quote=
1. On a reasoned proposal by one third of the Member States, by the European Parliament or by the European Commission, the Council, acting by a majority of four fifths of its members after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of the values referred to in Article 2. Before making such a determination, the Council shall hear the Member State in question and may address recommendations to it, acting in accordance with the same procedure.

The Council shall regularly verify that the grounds on which such a determination was made continue to apply.

2. The European Council, acting by unanimity on a proposal by one third of the Member States or by the Commission and after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the values referred to in Article 2, after inviting the Member State in question to submit its observations.

3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 has been made, the Council, acting by a qualified majority, may decide to suspend certain of the rights deriving from the application of the Treaties to the Member State in question, including the voting rights of the representative of the government of that Member State in the Council. In doing so, the Council shall take into account the possible consequences of such a suspension on the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons.

The obligations of the Member State in question under this Treaty shall in any case continue to be binding on that State.

4. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, may decide subsequently to vary or revoke measures taken under paragraph 3 in response to changes in the situation which led to their being imposed.

5. The voting arrangements applying to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council for the purposes of this Article are laid down in Article 354 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.

Following the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] the EU began to consider [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] to the former [[Eastern Bloc]] states. With concerns over the EU's ability to intervene where its core principles and values were violated, there was a desire to introduce some mechanism before [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|enlargement to those states took place]]. This came to be via the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] which allowed the suspension of rights of a member state which breached the EU's values under Article 2.&lt;ref name="expertexplains"&gt;[http://theconversation.com/article-7-sanctions-a-legal-expert-explains-the-eus-nuclear-option-81724 Article 7 sanctions: a legal expert explains the EU’s ‘nuclear option], the conversation 28 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2000, Austria formed a government which included the [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]]&lt;ref name="DolezalHutterWüest"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Dolezal|author2=Swen Hutter|author3=Bruno Wüest|chapter=Exploring the new cleavage in across arenas and public debates: designs and methods|editor1=Edgar Grande|editor2=Martin Dolezal|editor3=Marc Helbling|display-editors = 3 |editor4=Dominic Höglinger|title=Political Conflict in Western Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_zivrfDd3AC&amp;pg=PA52 |accessdate=19 July 2013|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02438-0|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bieling2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans-Jürgen Bieling|chapter=Uneven development and 'European crisis constitutionalism', or the reasons for and conditions of a 'passive revolution in trouble'|editor1=Johannes Jäger|editor2=Elisabeth Springler|title=Asymmetric Crisis in Europe and Possible Futures: Critical Political Economy and Post-Keynesian Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJsGCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-65298-4|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]]. Invoking Article 7 was deemed excessive so other member states threatened to cut off diplomatic contacts instead. This event led to a desire for an intermediate step to provide a warning sign without full suspension.&lt;ref name="pol11012016"&gt;[http://www.politico.eu/article/eu-can-still-block-hungarys-orban-veto-on-polish-pis-sanctions/ EU can still block Hungary’s veto on Polish sanctions] Politico 11 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eura04012016"&gt;[https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-europe/news/eu-takes-unprecedented-step-against-poland-over-rule-of-law/ EU takes unprecedented step against Poland over rule of law] Euractiv 4 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Treaty of Nice]] provided this (in Article 7.1) whereby the Council, acting by majority, may identify a potential breach and make recommendations to the state to rectify it before action is taken against it as outlined above.&lt;ref name="suspend"/&gt; In 2014 the European Commission introduced a three step mechanism to identify "systemic threats" to EU values. The mechanism must be complete before Article 7 is discussed.&lt;ref name="pol13012016"&gt;[http://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-eu-news-article-7-vote-poland-rule-of-law/ What is Article 7?] Politico 13 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
'''Article 7.1''': The mechanism begins with a proposal to find a "Clear Risk of Serious Breach" of EU values either by the Commission, the Parliament or one-third of member states. This is then approved by a two-thirds majority in Parliament. The accused country is then called to answer to the European Council, which may then issue recommendations and vote by four-fifths to identify a breach. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Running the Rule over Article 7 Explainer |url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/video/running-the-rule-over-article-7/ |accessdate=17 September 2018 |work=EURACTIV.com |publisher=EURACTIV.com |date=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 7.2''': In the event of a "serious and persistent breach" (i.e. the country does not heed the Council's guidance) then the Commission or one-third of countries, approved by a two-thirds majority in Parliament, calls the country to answer to the European Council again. The European Council must then decide unanimously to proceed to Article 7.3.

'''Article 7.3''': Once the European Council has unanimously decided that the breach is still occurring, they then vote by qualified majority to suspend rights of the accused country, including voting rights, until all duties are fulfilled.

==Usage==
In its early history, from about 2000 to 2012, the possibility of activating Article 7 was debated but official recommendations were not made. Events for which activation of Article 7 was debated include the aforementioned Austrian coalition with the far right in 2000, the French government expulsion of thousands of [[Romani people|Roma]] in 2009 and a political struggle in Romania between [[Traian Băsescu]] and [[Victor Ponta]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="expertexplains"/&gt;

In June 2015, the European Parliament asked the Commission to present a proposal for starting the mechanism against Hungary over rule of law concerns in the country; but in October voted down a similar proposal to begin procedures against Hungary over its treatment of migrants.&lt;ref name="pol13012016"/&gt; At the same time, a [[European Citizens' Initiative]] called for the start of Article 7 mechanisms against Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://euobserver.com/political/131313 Commission registers call for EU sanctions on Hungary], EU Observer 30 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the end of 2015, the Polish government [[Polish Constitutional Court crisis, 2015#International reaction|became subject to international criticism]] over its media and judiciary changes and the European Commission began action against Poland in January 2016.&lt;ref name="eura04012016"/&gt; On 20 December 2017, the European Commission triggered Article 7 for the first time in relation to Polish judicial reforms because, in the view of the Commission, they remove the [[separation of powers]] between the executive and the judiciary. "After two years, the Commission can only conclude that there is now a clear risk of a serious breach of the [[rule of law]]," Vice President [[Frans Timmermans]] added. Any action to deprive Poland of its voting rights would require a unanimous vote of its fellow member states. {{asof|2017|12}}, Hungary would be expected to exercise its veto in Poland's favour. Romania expressed concerns that it could face similar sanctions in the future if the action succeeded against Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.politico.eu/article/klaus-iohannis-warns-romania-could-be-in-line-after-poland-article-7/ President warns Romania could be next in line after Poland], politico.eu 20/12/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2018, the European Parliament voted for action against Hungary, alleging breaches of core EU values&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20180906IPR12104/rule-of-law-in-hungary-parliament-calls-on-the-eu-to-act European Parliament to trigger article 7 procedure against a member state]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45498514 The European Parliament has voted to pursue unprecedented disciplinary action against Hungary]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UK Conservative Party|UK Conservative]] MEPs supported the right wing Hungarian leader, [[Viktor Orbán]], against a motion to censure him in the [[European Parliament]].{{sfn|Watts|2018}} 

[[Pablo Casado]] leader of the [[People's Party (Spain)|Spain's People's Party]] directly ordered the PP members of the [[European Parliament]] to abstain in the voting of the [[Judith Sargentini|Sargentini]] report calling for triggering [[Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 7]] proceedings against the Hungarian government of [[Viktor Orbán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Carmen|last=Riego|journal=[[La Vanguardia]]|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/edicion-impresa/20180912/451783325778/el-lider-del-pp-ordena-abstenerse-en-la-sancion-europea-a-hungria.html|title=El líder del PP ordena abstenerse en la sanción europea a Hungría|date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expulsion==
While a state can be suspended, there is no provision to expel a member state outright. The idea appeared in the drafting of the [[European Constitution]] and the [[Lisbon Treaty]] but failed to be included. There are a number of considerations which make such a provision impractical. Firstly, a member state leaving would require [[amendments]] to the treaties, and amendments require unanimity. Unanimity would be impossible to achieve if the state did not want to leave of its own free will. Secondly it is legally complicated, particularly with all the rights and privileges being withdrawn for both sides that would not be resolved by an orderly and voluntary withdrawal. Third, the concept of expulsion goes against the spirit of the treaties. Most available sanctions are conciliatory, not punitive; they do not punish a state for failing to live up to fellow states' demands, but encourage a state to fulfill its treaty obligations; expulsion would certainly not achieve that.&lt;ref name="expel"&gt;Athanassiou, Phoebus (December 2009) [http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp10.pdf Withdrawal and Expulsion from the EU and EMU, Some Reflections] (PDF), European Central Bank.

'''Black jails''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|黑監獄}}|p={{linktext|hēijiānyù}}}}) are a network of extralegal detention centers established by Chinese security forces and [[Private security company|private security companies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinavalue.net/Finance/Blog/2010-9-29/482946.aspx|title=安元鼎：北京截访"黑监狱"调查 |date= 24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; across the People's Republic of China in recent years. They are used mainly to detain, without trial, [[Petitioning (China)|petitioners]] (上访者, ''shangfangzhe''), who travel to seek redress for grievances unresolved at the local level. The right to petition was available in ancient China, and was later revived by the communists, with important differences.

Black jails have no official or legal status, differentiating them from detention centers, the criminal arrest process, or formal sentencing to jail or prison. They are in wide use in Beijing, in particular, and serve as holding locations for the many petitioners who travel to the central Office of Letters and Calls to petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/petitioner-11202008094643.html|title='Black Jail' Plea from Hospital |date= 20 November 2008|publisher=Radio Free Asia|accessdate = 7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=9308343 Black jail guard convicted of rape], [[Associated Press]], 12 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The jails were introduced to replace the [[Custody and repatriation|Custody and Repatriation]] system after it was abolished in 2003 following the notorious [[Custody and repatriation#Sun Zhigang|Sun Zhigang]] incident. The existence of such jails is acknowledged by at least part of the [[Communist Party of China|CCP]] officialdom, following a [[police raid]] of one of them and criminal trial of the company running it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=北京昌平区政府承认"黑监狱"属实 拒透露细节|url=http://news.china.com/zh_cn/social/1007/20110803/16684230.html|date = 3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to human rights groups, black jails are a growing industry. The system includes so-called "interceptors",&lt;ref&gt;({{zh|c={{linktext|截|访|者}}}})&lt;/ref&gt; or "black guards",&lt;ref name=Caixin4213&gt;{{cite news|title=A Day in the Life of a Beijing 'Black Guard': A Henan native collected his pay and quit his job stopping petitioners from airing their grievances in Beijing.

The facilities may be located in state-owned hotels, hostels, hospitals, psychiatric facilities, residential buildings, or government ministry buildings, among others.

== Background ==
The appearance of black jails was the authorities' response to the use of the "letters and calls" system (also known as "petitioning"), which attempts to resolve disputes at the local level.&lt;ref name="hrw-alley"&gt;Human Rights Watch, [https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/11/12/alleyway-hell-0 "An Alleyway in Hell"], 12 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As a modern version of the imperial tradition, reinstated by the communists after 1949, the petitioning system permits citizens to report local abuse of power to higher levels of government. Because local courts are beholden to local officials, however, and since pursuing redress through the legal system is too expensive for rural Chinese, petitioning in modern China has become the only channel for seeking redress.&lt;ref name="hrw-alley"/&gt;

Petitioners may begin their attempts for redress at the at local-level letters and calls office, which are located in courthouses or in township-level government offices. If unsatisfied, they can move up the hierarchy to provincial level offices and, at the highest level, the State Bureau for Letters and Visits in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;HRW's "Alleyway" citing Li Li, "Life in a Struggle," Beijing Review, 4 May 2005, http://www.bjreview.cn/EN/En-2005/05-45-e/china-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HRW's "Alleyway" citing Jonathan K. Ocko, "I'll take it all the way to Beijing: Capital appeals in the Qing," Journal of Asian Studies, vol. 47.2 (May 1988), p.294&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of people using the petitioning system has increased since 1993, to the extent that the system has been strained for years. Official statistics indicate that petition offices annually handled around 10 million inquiries and complaints from petitioners from 2003 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;HRW's "Alleyway" citing Li Huizi and Zhou Erjie, "China's public complaint department busiest office in Beijing," Xinhua News Agency, 2 September 2007, http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-09/02/content_6142475.htm (accessed 11 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its enduring nature and political support, the system has never been an effective mechanism for dealing with the complaints brought to it – largely because it is chronically overwhelmed by the number of people seeking redress.&lt;ref&gt;HRW's "Alleyway" citing Carl F. Minzner, "Xinfang: An Alternative to the Formal Chinese Legal System," Stanford Journal of International Law, vol. 42:1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegedly, local officials, with the tolerance of public security authorities, establish the black jails as a way to ensure that complainants are detained, punished, and sent home so that these officials will not suffer demerits under rules that impose bureaucratic penalties when there is a large flow of petitioners from their areas. Black jails are used to protect government officials at the county, municipal, and provincial levels from financial and career advancement penalties. Unpublished local government documents describe penalties levied against local officials who fail to take decisive action when petitioners from their geographical area seek legal redress in provincial capitals and Beijing. The operators of black jails allegedly receive from those local-level governments daily cash payments of 150 yuan (US$22) to 200 yuan (US$29) per person.&lt;ref name="hrw-secret"&gt;Human Rights Watch, [https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/11/02/china-secret-black-jails-hide-severe-rights-abuses "China: Secret “Black Jails” Hide Severe Rights Abuses"], 12 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment of detainees ==
Human Rights Watch published the report ''An Alleyway in Hell'' dedicated to exploring the issue. It documents how government officials, security forces, and their agents routinely abduct people, usually petitioners, off the streets of Beijing and other Chinese cities, "strip them of their possessions, and imprison them."&lt;ref name="hrw-secret"/&gt;

According to reporters visiting the jails, those detained inside them are beaten, starved, and sometimes hosed down with water.&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, Aidan. "[http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/247856/the-terrible-secrets-of-beijings-black-jails.thtml The terrible secrets of Beijing’s "black jails"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415230956/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/247856/the-terrible-secrets-of-beijings-black-jails.thtml |date=15 April 2009 }}" ''[[The Spectator]]''. 13 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 20 or 30 people may be forced to inhabit a single room, including those suffering from disabilities. Many are deprived of food, sleep, and medical care, and are subject to theft and extortion by their guards. They have no access to family members or to legal counsel or courts. Thousands of people are abducted off the streets of Chinese cities and held incommunicado for weeks or months in these conditions. The makeshift jails are found in state-owned hostels, hotels, nursing homes, and mental hospitals, among other locations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]], [https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/11/12/alleyway-hell-0 "An Alleyway in Hell"], 12 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accounts ===
Numerous accounts of conditions inside the institutions have made their way into Western media and human rights groups reports. For example, one 46-year-old former detainee from Jiangsu province, who spent more than a month in a black jail, "cried with fear and frustration as she recalled her abduction. [The abductors] are inhuman...two people dragged me by the hair and put me into the car. My two hands were tied up and I couldn't move. Then [after arriving back in Jiangsu] they put me inside a room where there were two women who stripped me of my clothes...[and] beat my head [and] used their feet to stomp my body," the former detainee said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/11/02/china-secret-black-jails-hide-severe-rights-abuses |title=China Secret Blak Jails Hide Severe Rights Abuses |date=November 2, 2009 |accessdate=March 21, 2014 |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Official stance ==
{{see also|Human Rights in China#Counterarguments by the PRC government}}
The authorities have repeatedly denied the existence of black jails. In an April 2009 Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) press conference, an official responded to an [[Al Jazeera]] correspondent's query about black jails by stating categorically that, "Things like this do not exist in China." In June 2009, the Chinese government asserted in the Outcome Report of the United Nations Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review of China's human rights record that, "There are no black jails in the country."&lt;ref name="hrw-secret"/&gt;

However, in September 2010, it was reported that Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau officials have detained Zhang Jun, chairman of "Anyuanding Security Service Company", and Zhang Jie, general manager of this company, for "illegally detaining people and illegal business operation". The company started business in 2004. In 2008, it began to help Beijing liaison offices of local governments to stop petitioners from their regions from petitioning in Beijing. The company employees first lied to the petitioners, telling them that their lodging has been provided. Then, the company employees took them to abandoned hotels or rented houses in suburban Beijing, seized their IDs and phones, and locked them up until the liaison offices told the company to help send the petitioners back to their hometowns. Later, the company expanded its business and got more clients including even remote village governments to help the local governments "maintain stability".

On 15 May 2010, a guard of a black jail located in a Beijing hotel received his final judgment of 8 years of imprisonment for raping a female petitioner who had been illegally held in custody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/usa/2010-09/27/content_11354625.htm China Daily.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Cameroon]] on 20 May 1972. The new constitution would make the country a unitary state, as opposed to the previous federal system, as well as giving more powers to President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/cm.html Elections in Cameroon] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed by 99.99% of voters with a 98.2% turnout.

A '''charitable for-profit entity''' is an organization that exists to serve a [[Charity (practice)|charitable mission]] but is legally organized as a [[for-profit corporation]]. Both [[benefit corporation]]s and [[Low-profit limited liability company|Low-profit limited liability companies]] (L3C) fall under this category. As well as generating a profit, a charitable for-profit entity concentrates on setting a social objective. The business must achieve its social purpose as well as having a profit income if it is to be successful.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news |last=Gomez |first=Evangeline |title=The rise of the charitable for-profit entity |newspaper=[[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangelinegomez/2012/01/13/the-rise-of-the-charitable-for-profit-entity/ |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of organizing charitable work under for-profit rules rather than as a traditional [[Charitable organization|charity]] such as a [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] gained prominency, when [[Google]] announced its [[Google.org]] branch in 2006.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Hafner|first=Katie|title=Philanthropy Google’s Way: Not the Usual|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/technology/14google.html|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the subject has been under both academic and public debate with U.S. law professor [[Eric Posner]] arguing in favor of expanding [[Charity law]] to include for-profit charities,&lt;ref name=Posner&gt;{{cite journal |author1=[[Eric A. Posner]] |author2=Anup Malani |year=2007 |title=The Case for For-Profit Charities |journal=[[Virginia Law Review]] |pages=2017–2067 |ssrn=928976 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Brian Galle considered the legislative popularity of [[social enterprise]]s a "race to the bottom among states competing to siphon away federal tax dollars for local businesses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brian Galle |year=2013 |title=Social Enterprise: Who Needs It. |journal=[[Boston College Law Review]] |issue=54 |pages=2025 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal forms==

=== Benefit corporations ===
When a company is created under corporate law it is called [[Benefit corporation]]. This differs from a ‘B Corp’ which is qualified by B Lab to meet detailed standards for social and environmental performance.{{dubious|date=January 2016}}

Being a benefit corporation can be very beneficial for the company as it allows them to legally protect their social goals by concentrating on other sectors rather than only considering profit. This allows the business to instead of only concentrating on the shareholders that designated them in the first place, they are able to concentrate on all stakeholders and take into consideration of their interests which can help them solve social and environmental challenges. The demand for corporate accountability is increasing rapidly and is at the highest it has ever been and therefore benefit corporations can differentiate their company from other leading company’s and concentrate on these customers.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bend|first1=Doug|last2=King|first2=Alex|title=Why Consider A Benefit Corporation?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2014/05/30/why-consider-a-benefit-corporation/|website=Forbes|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be many drawbacks of a benefit corporation such as expanded reporting requirements. This provides shareholders of the business with sufficient information to determine whether your business is achieving its purpose and goals. A benefit corporation must produce an annual report for each of its shareholders so that the company can be assessed by a third party. The report will have to include the efforts that have been made in order to achieve a general public benefit and will all have to be stated on the annual report that should be available on the company website.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

=== Low-profit limited liability company ===
A [[Low-profit limited liability company]] (L3C) is a low limited liability company that has a set mission of being socially beneficial similarly to the way a non-profit company has also. However a non-profit company will not distribute its profits the way a for-profit company does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parekh |first1=Neetal |title=What is an L3C? |url=http://www.innov8social.com/2011/10/what-is-l3c-low-profit-limited.html |website=innov8social |accessdate=29 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029233117/http://www.innov8social.com/2011/10/what-is-l3c-low-profit-limited.html |archivedate=29 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
A limited liability company takes advantage of both non-profit and for profit sources of capital. An L3C can attract a diverse group of creditors to finance its operations, including private foundations and socially conscious for-profit entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Low Profit Limited Liability Company|url=http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/low-profit-limited-liability-company|website=Digital Media Law Project|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between charitable for-profit entity and not-for-profit charities ==
Charities are organizations that are set up to provide help and raise money for those in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Charity in English|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/charity|website=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional charities aim to provide a service to the needy with no profits earned for the owners of the organisation. All the money that is donated to the organization is used for the purpose of the business and is used to pursue their objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not For Profit|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/not-for-profit.asp|website=Investopedia|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A charity is founded to serve a humanitarian or environmental need to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingram|first1=David|title=Non Profit Organization Vs. Profit Organization|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/non-profit-organization-vs-profit-organization-4150.html|website=Chron|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A charitable for-profit entity however differs from this as the organization will aim for a profit whilst still providing similar services as a charity. The for-profit entity may also be directed by a sole proprietor, while a non-profit organization needs a board of directors. Like any other for-profit organization it will base its accounting on the quarterly income, whereas a non-profit charity will purely focus on the activities carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=James|title=The Major Accounting Differences Between Profit &amp; Non Profit Organizations|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/major-accounting-differences-between-profit-non-profit-organizations-26257.html|website=Chron|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large majority of businesses will usually concentrate on the financial benefits of its owners and shareholders when setting up a business. The main aim of most businesses, including Charitable for-profit entities, are to generate some sort of profit for the business. By producing profit, the charitable for-profit entity is able to continue its work to a high standard and also pay the stakeholders of the company. Charitable for-profit entities will however have to pay taxes on the profit that is made. This differs from a traditional (non-profit) charity because they do not have to pay taxes as no profit is generated for themselves.

If a charitable for-profit entity was to go out of business, its assets can be liquidated and the proceedings will be distributed to the shareholders of the business. However, if a charity was to go out of business they would have to distribute their assets to another non-profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fritz|first1=Joanne|title=How is a non-profit different from a for-profit business?|url=http://nonprofit.about.com/od/qathebasics/f/nopvspro.htm|website=About Money|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similarities between charitable for-profit entity and not-for-profit charities ==
Although there are many differences between charitable for-profit entities and traditional charities, they do hold some similarities that can be said to be quite major. Both will have a strong vision in what they want from the business overall. Both will therefore have similar strategic plans in order to get the best out of the business regardless of their aims and objectives being different to an extent. For-profit entities and non-profit charities will both strive to meet their objectives that are laid out on their mission statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goessl|first1=Leigh|title=Nonprofits and for-profits often share similar tactics to reach goals|url=http://www.insidebusiness360.com/index.php/nonprofits-and-for-profits-often-share-similar-tactics-to-reach-goals-25311/|website=Inside Business|accessdate=29 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009180016/http://www.insidebusiness360.com/index.php/nonprofits-and-for-profits-often-share-similar-tactics-to-reach-goals-25311/|archivedate=9 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are both given limited funds, so will therefore have to aim to meet their goals with the funds provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=B.Bennett|first1=Adrian|title=Similarities &amp; Differences between Non Profits &amp; For-Profits|url=http://www.startnonprofitorganization.com/nonprofits-versus-business|website=Nonprofit Central|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Computer Misuse Act 1990''' is an Act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], introduced partly in response to the decision in ''R v Gold &amp; Schifreen'' (1988) 1 AC 1063 (see below). Critics of the bill complained that it was introduced hastily and was poorly thought out.{{who|date=January 2013}} [[Intention (criminal law)|Intention]], they said, was often difficult to prove, and that the bill inadequately differentiated "joyriding" [[Hacker (term)|hackers]] like [[Stephen Gold|Gold]] and [[Robert Schifreen|Schifreen]] from serious computer criminals. The Act has nonetheless become a model from which several other countries, including [[Canada]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], have drawn inspiration when subsequently drafting their own information security laws, as it is seen "as a robust and flexible piece of legislation in terms of dealing with cybercrime”.&lt;ref&gt;IISS Global Perspectives – Power in Cyberspace. Q&amp;A with Nigel Inkster, Director, Transnational Threats and Political Risk, IISS. 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Several amendments have been passed to keep the Act up to date.

==''R v Gold &amp; Schifreen''==
[[Robert Schifreen]] and [[Stephen Gold]], using conventional [[home computer]]s and [[modem]]s in late 1984 and early 1985, gained unauthorised access to [[BT Group plc|British Telecom]]'s [[Prestel]] interactive [[viewdata]] service. While at a trade show, Schifreen, by doing what latterly became known as [[Shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]], had observed the password of a Prestel engineer:{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} the username was 22222222 and the password was 1234.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mgl/profcomp/lectures/lecture2.pdf |title=Lecture 2: Legal Perspectives |series=Professional Computing |first=Mark |last=Lee |department=School of Computer Science |publisher=[[University of Birmingham]] |date=Autumn 2014 |access-date=19 May 2017 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Andrew|title=Information Technology Law: The Law and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C37ADAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA358|accessdate=19 May 2017|edition=3rd|year=2016|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-873246-4|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later gave rise to subsequent accusations that BT had not taken security seriously. Armed with this information, the pair explored the system, even gaining access to the personal message box of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]].

Prestel installed monitors on the suspect accounts and passed information thus obtained to the police. The pair were charged under section 1 of the [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]] with defrauding BT by manufacturing a "false instrument", namely the internal condition of BT's equipment after it had processed Gold's eavesdropped password. Tried at [[Southwark]] [[Crown Court]], they were convicted on [[specimen charges]] (five against Schifreen, four against Gold) and fined, respectively, £750 and £600.

Although the fines imposed were modest, they elected to appeal to the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal. Their counsel cited the lack of  evidence showing the two had attempted to obtain material gain from their exploits, and claimed the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act had been misapplied to their conduct. They were acquitted by the Lord Justice Lane, but the prosecution appealed to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]. In 1988, the Lords upheld the acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;HL 21 April 1988, [1988] AC 1063 summary at [http://swarb.co.uk/regina-v-gold-and-schifreen-hl-21-apr-1988/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Brandon, Baron Brandon of Oakbrook|Lord Justice Brandon]] said:

:We have accordingly come to the conclusion that the language of the Act was not intended to apply to the situation which was shown to exist in this case. The submissions at the close of the prosecution case should have succeeded. It is a conclusion which we reach without regret. The Procrustean attempt&lt;ref&gt;Here Lord Brandon alludes to the classical myth of [[Procrustes]], who would stretch his victims (or cut off their legs) in order to fit a bed for which they were ill suited.&lt;/ref&gt; to force these facts into the language of an Act not designed to fit them produced grave difficulties for both judge and jury which we would not wish to see repeated. The appellants' conduct amounted in essence, as already stated, to dishonestly gaining access to the relevant Prestel data bank by a trick. That is not a criminal offence. If it is thought desirable to make it so, that is a matter for the legislature rather than the courts.

The Law Lords' ruling led many legal scholars to believe that hacking was not unlawful as the law then stood. The [[English Law Commission]] (ELC) and its counterpart in Scotland both considered the matter. The [[Scottish Law Commission]] (SLC) concluded that intrusion was adequately covered in Scotland under the [[Scots law|common law]] related to deception, but the ELC believed a new law was necessary.

Since the case, both defendants have written extensively about IT matters. Gold, who detailed the entire case at some length in the ''Hacker's Handbook'', has presented at conferences alongside the arresting officers in the case.&lt;ref name="thereg-20150113"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/01/13/steve_gold_obit/ |title='80s hacker turned journo, IT crime ace Steve Gold logs off |author=John Leyden |newspaper=The Register |date=13 January 2015 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Computer Misuse Act==
Based on the ELC's recommendations, a [[private member's bill]] was introduced by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Michael Colvin]]. The bill, supported by the government, came into effect in 1990. Sections 1-3 of the Act introduced three criminal offences:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/UKpga_19900018_en_1.htm Computer Misuse Act 1990], s1 - s3&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Hacker (computer security)|unauthorised access]] to computer material, punishable by 12 months' imprisonment (or 6 months in Scotland) and/or a fine "not exceeding level 5 on the [[standard scale]]" (since 2015, unlimited);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/section/1&lt;/ref&gt;
# unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offences, punishable by 12 months/maximum fine (or 6 months in Scotland) on [[summary conviction]] and/or 5 years/fine on [[indictment]];&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/section/2&lt;/ref&gt;
# unauthorised modification of computer material, punishable by 12 months/maximum fine (or 6 months in Scotland) on summary conviction and/or 10 years/fine on indictment;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/section/3&lt;/ref&gt;

§§2–3 They intended to deter the more serious criminals from using a computer to assist in the commission of a criminal offence or from impairing or hindering access to data stored in a computer. The basic offence is to attempt or achieve access to a computer or the data it stores, by inducing a computer to perform any function with intent to secure access. [[Hacker (computer security)|Hackers]] who program their computers to search through password permutations are therefore liable, even if their attempts to log on are rejected by the target computer. The only precondition to liability is that the hacker should be aware that the access attempted is unauthorised. Thus, using another person's [[username]] or [[identifier]] (ID) and [[password]] without proper authority to access data or a program, or to alter, delete, copy or move a program or data, or simply to output a program or data to a screen or printer, or to impersonate that other person using [[e-mail]], [[online chat]], web or other services, constitute the offence. Even if the initial access is authorised, subsequent exploration, if there is a hierarchy of privileges in the system, may lead to entry to parts of the system for which the requisite privileges are lacking and the offence will be committed. Looking over a user's shoulder or using sophisticated electronic equipment to monitor the [[electromagnetic radiation]] emitted by [[Visual display unit|VDUs]] ("electronic eavesdropping") is outside the scope of this offence.

The §§2–3 offences are aggravated offences, requiring a specific intent to commit another offence (for these purposes, the other offences are to be [[arrest]]able, and so include all the major [[common law]] and [[statutory]] offences of [[fraud]] and [[dishonesty]]). So a hacker who obtains access to a system intending to transfer money or shares, intends to commit [[theft]], or to obtain confidential information for [[blackmail]] or [[extortion]]. Thus, the §1 offence is committed as soon as the unauthorised access is attempted, and the §2 offence overtakes liability as soon as specific access is made for the criminal purpose. The §3 offence is specifically aimed at those who write and circulate a [[computer virus]] or [[computer worm|worm]], whether on a [[Local area network|LAN]] or across [[computer network|networks]]. Similarly, using [[phishing]] techniques or a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] to obtain identity data or to acquire any other data from an unauthorised source, or modifying the operating system files or some aspect of the computer's functions to interfere with its operation or prevent access to any data, including the destruction of files, or deliberately generating code to cause a complete system malfunction, are all criminal "modifications". In 2004, John Thornley pleaded guilty to four offences under §3, having mounted an attack on a rival site, and introduced a Trojan horse to bring it down on several occasions, but it was recognised that the wording of the offence needed to be clarified to confirm that all forms of [[denial of service]] attack are included.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Implications for industry practices==
Although the Act ostensibly targets those who wish to gain unauthorised access to computer systems for various purposes, its implications on previously relatively widespread or well-known industry practices such as the "time-locking" of software have been described in various computing industry publications.&lt;ref name="Naylor 1994"&gt;{{cite news | last=Naylor | first=Chris | title=Locked up | work=Personal Computer World | date=July 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Time-locking is the practice of disabling functionality or whole programs in order to ensure that software, potentially delivered on condition of further payment, will "expire" and thus no longer function.

==Latest situation==
&lt;!-- need a paragraph here about notable convictions under the act --&gt;
The Schedule 1 Part II 'Conspiracy' of the [[Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998]] amended Section 8 (relevance of external law), Section 9(2)(b) (British citizenship immaterial: conspiracy) and Section 16 (application to Northern Ireland). For text see reference.&lt;ref name=Justice_Act_1988&gt;{{cite web |title=Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 Schedule 1 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/40/schedule/1 |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=24 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the All-Party Internet Group published its review of the law and highlighted areas for development. Their recommendations led to the drafting of the ''Computer Misuse Act 1990 (Amendment) Bill'' which sought to amend the CMA to comply with the European Convention on Cyber Crime.&lt;ref&gt;http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Under its terms, the maximum sentence of imprisonment for breaching the Act changed from six months to two years. It also sought to explicitly criminalise [[denial-of-service attack]]s and other crimes facilitated by denial-of-service. The Bill did not receive [[Royal Assent]] because Parliament was [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]].

Sections 35 to 38 of the [[Police and Justice Act 2006]] contain amendments to the Computer Misuse Act 1990.

Section 37 (''Making, supplying or obtaining articles for use in computer misuse offences'') inserts a new section 3A into the 1990 Act and has drawn considerable criticism from IT professionals, as many of their tools can be used by criminals in addition to their legitimate purposes, and thus fall under section 3A.

After the [[News International phone hacking scandal]] in 2011, there are ongoing discussions about amending the law to define "smart" phones (i.e. those with Internet browsers and other connectivity features) as computers under the Act. This amendment may also introduce a new offence of ''making information available with intent'', i.e. publicly disclosing a password for someone's phone or computer so that others can access it illegally.&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmstnprv/628/62805.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Act was further amended by Part 2 sections 41 to 44 (plus others) of the [[Serious Crime Bill 2014|Serious Crime Act 2015]]&lt;ref name=Serious_2015&gt;{{cite web |title=Serious Crime Act of 2015 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/9/pdfs/ukpga_20150009_en.pdf |publisher=UK Government |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Digest of the Laws of England''''', also known as '''''Comyns' Digest''''', is a book by [[John Comyns|Sir John Comyns]].&lt;ref&gt;Marvin, J.G. [[Marvin's Legal Bibliography|Legal Bibliography, or a thesaurus of American, English, Irish and Scotch law books:together with some continental treatises]]. T &amp; J W Johnson. 1847. Page 218. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DSNEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Digitised copy] from [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; The latest English edition was published in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]. 1999. Page xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1847, [[John Gage Marvin]] said:

{{Blockquote|The most esteemed editions are the first and fifth English, and the first American. Judge Story says "the first is far superior to all the late editions. The modern editions have the addition of the modern Cases, it is true, but they consist of the marginal notes of the reporters, thrust into the text without order or propriety, and destroy the symmetry and conexion." The method and style of Comyns' Digest, differs considerably from any similar production, being based on a systematic and scientific distribution and subdivision of the titles of the law. The author first lays down a general proposition, which he supports and illustrates by examples and authorities, and these are branched out and divided into consequential positions illustrated and supported in the same manner, and finally the doctrines are qualified or restrained by exceptions; "all which is done with remarkable clearness and conciseness of expression, and the information desired is seldom long sought after in vain." It has the honour of being cited and received as an authority in Courts of Justice, which reputation few text books and no other Digest enjoys. Even Comyns' opinions or ''[[dicta]]'', have been regarded with all the consideration that is due to decisions of the highest judicial tribunals. [[Lord Kenyon]], in alluding to a position in the Digest, says - Comyns "has not indeed cited any authority for this opinion, but his opinion alone is of great authority, since he was considered by his contemporaries as the most able lawyer in [[Westminster Hall]]." Chief Justice Best also remarks, upon citing Comyns: "This he lays down on his own authority, without referring to any case; and I am warranted in saying, we cannot have a better authority than that learned writer." For its exact and methodical analysis, for the succinct, perspicuous, and compressed form in which the Cases are stated, Comyns' Digest stands unrivalled in the annals of the law. Its extreme condensation of authorities, renders it chiefly valuable as a book of reference to the Reports, and by its wonderful accuracy rarely leads the consulter astray. The author seems to have particularly exerted himself in elaborating the title ''Pleader'', which is "a more systematic compilation upon Pleading than had previously appeared; comprising the substance not only of the authorities collected in the ''Doctrina Placitandi'', but also of the Cases subsequently decided, and reducing the whole under different heads upon a plan peculiarly scientific and masterly."

''Comyns' Digest'' was originally composed in [[law French]], and the headings of the titles, still retaining this ''venerable jargon'', may give the novice a little trouble in finding the desired object of pursuit. Some mistakes of Comyns will be found noticed in 5 Taunt. 707, 709; 1 Maul. &amp; Sel. 363; 1 Barn. &amp; Ald. 712; (3) 586; (4) 442; 3 Mason, 283.

The American edition of ''Comyns'' is ably edited.

'''Donald Bruce Mackay''' (13 September 1933 – 15 July 1977) was an [[Australian]] [[businessman]]. He was also a prominent [[substance abuse]] campaigner who came to media attention and fame in 1977 through the circumstances of his murder, which has never been solved.

==Personal life and background ==
Mackay was born in [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] and raised in Sydney. He and his family ran a furniture business in Griffith called Mackay's Furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://download.e-bookshelf.de/download/0000/8425/12/L-X-0000842512-0002919282.XHTML/index.xhtml |title=Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities |first1=John |last1=Silvester |first2=Andrew |last2=Rule |publisher=Floradale Productions &amp; Sly Ink |date=9 May 2010 |chapter=Biographies |isbn=978-0977544097 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife Barbara (1935–2001) was an active member of the [[Uniting Church]] in Griffith and was a part-time [[Physical therapy|physiotherapist]]. Today, the Mackay family still has a property in Griffith,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/organised-crime-thrives-40-years-after-the-donald-mackay-murder-20170709-gx7sg4.html |title=Forty years after Donald Mackay's murder, the Calabrian mafia still thrives |last=Hicks |first=Lesley |date=14 July 2017 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=13 July 2018 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Donald Mackay's son, Paul, now runs the family furniture store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.9news.com.au/9stories/2017/07/14/13/03/police-appeal-for-help-in-finding-donald-mackay-body |title=Still no body found after infamous political assassination 40 years ago |last=Wood |first=Richard |date=14 July 2017 |work=[[Nine News]] |access-date=13 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Mackay stood as a [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] candidate for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] against [[Al Grassby]] in the electorate of [[Division of Riverina|Riverina]]. His preferences went to the [[Australian Country Party (1920)|Country Party]] candidate [[John Sullivan (Australian politician)|John Sullivan]], allowing Sullivan to unseat Grassby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poprzeczny|first=Joseph|title=BOOKS: SMACK EXPRESS: How Organised Crime Got Hooked on Drugs, by Clive Small and Tom Gilling|url=http://www.newsweekly.com.au/articles/2009apr04_b1.html|accessdate=19 May 2011|work=News Weekly|date=4 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014131212/http://www.newsweekly.com.au/articles/2009apr04_b1.html|archivedate=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKay also stood for the Liberal Party in the state seat of [[Electoral district of Murrumbidgee|Murrumbidgee]] at the [[New South Wales state election, 1973|1973]] and [[New South Wales state election, 1976|1976]] New South Wales state elections, but was unsuccessful.

== Lead-up to murder ==

Concerned about the growing drug trade in his local area, and learning of a large crop of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in nearby [[Coleambally, New South Wales|Coleambally]], Mackay informed Sydney drug squad detectives, resulting in several arrests and the conviction of four men of Italian descent. At the trial of the arrested men, Mackay was identified as the [[whistleblower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Tony|title=Heartache has no end for family of Donald Mackay|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/heartache-has-no-end-for-family-of-donald-mackay-20110429-1e0if.html|accessdate=19 May 2011|newspaper=The Age|date=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt was made to lure Mackay to [[Jerilderie, New South Wales|Jerilderie]] by a "Mr Adams" who wished to make a large order of furniture from Mackay's family business. Mackay, busy with other matters, sent employee Bruce Pursehouse to meet "Adams", who did not approach Pursehouse. This is believed to have been an attempt to assassinate Mackay. Pursehouse later identified a man he had seen at Jerilderie as a suspect in the Mackay killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=4 July 1986|author=Jenny Cooke|title=Witness still sees the face of a killer|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OzZWAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2378%2C1759686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evening of Mackay's murder ==

On 15 July 1977, Mackay disappeared from a hotel car park after having drinks with friends and has never been found. Stains from his blood group were evident on his van&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=28 July 1982|title=Mackay inquest December 6|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZNNYAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3491%2C9328728|quote=Blood of the same group as Mr Mackay's was found spattered over the off-side bonnet and front tyre of his abandoned Minivan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ground nearby, and his car keys were underneath the van.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 March 1984|title=Mackay killed for $10,000, inquest told|page=1|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AK9WAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5377%2C6892493|quote=Underneath were his car keys and nearby there were bloodstains...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby were drag marks, hair, and three spent [[.22]] calibre cases.&lt;ref name="twistingtrail"&gt;{{cite news|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=17 April 1986|title=Twisting trail that led to Mackay's murderer|author=Jenny Cooke|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xrcyAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4704%2C607758|quote=While Mr Mackay's body has never been found, drag marks, hair and three spent .22 cartridge cases were found near his minivan in the hotel carpark the next day.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking|Woodward Royal Commission]] found that the six prime suspects to the murder all had convenient alibis.&lt;ref name="bottom29"&gt;Bottom, ''Shadow of Shame'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of the murder, Tony and Domenic Sergi, nominated as principal suspects by the Commission, were on a "pub crawl" in Griffith with a number of police officers;&lt;ref name="bottom29" /&gt; Giuseppe and Rocco Barbaro went to Sydney and, then, the Gold Coast, not returning to Griffith until 20 July;&lt;ref name="bottom29" /&gt; Francesco Barbaro, brother-in-law of Tony Sergi and cousin of Saverio Barbaro (who had been arrested three months earlier for marijuana production), stayed at the Griffith Ex-Servicemen's Club;&lt;ref name="bottom29" /&gt; and [[Robert Trimbole]] was at Randwick, Sydney, at a restaurant.&lt;ref name="bottom29" /&gt;

Mackay's disappearance made headlines around the nation and many, such as Griffith supervisor of detectives James Bindon, drew the conclusion that gangland figure Robert Trimbole was responsible for the apparent [[Hit man|contract-style killing]].&lt;ref name="inq74threat" /&gt; Trimbole had previously made death threats against Mackay.&lt;ref name="inq74threat"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=16 June 1986|title=Inquiry told of Trimbole's 1974 threat to kill Mackay|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8JgRAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1704,47971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killing fuelled the perception of Griffith as full of mobsters and "Australia's marijuana capital".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Age|date=16 June 1983|author=Tony Harrington|page=10|title=Aussie Bob, the panel beater who became a millionaire|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LCBVAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2168%2C91949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Woodward Royal Commission ==

The Mackay case led to the then-[[Premier of New South Wales|premier]] [[Neville Wran]] appointing Justice [[Philip Woodward (judge)|Philip Woodward]] to lead the [[Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking|Woodward Royal Commission]] into the [[illegal drug trade]] in [[New South Wales]]. In 1979, Woodward found that Mackay had been murdered by a hitman acting on instructions from the "[[Honoured Society (Australia)|Honoured Society]]", a Griffith-based cell of the [['Ndrangheta]], a [[Calabria]]n criminal organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Age|date=8 November 1979|page=1|title=Secret crime report; State warned 15 years ago on Calabrians|author=David Elias|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EudUAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5123%2C3458528|quote=Mr. Justice Woodward linked the Honored Society with the control of drugs around Griffith, the murder of anti-drug campaigner Mr. Donald Mackay and the 1963 Victoria Market murders.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=7 November 1979|page=1|title=Mackay killed by Griffith drug group, judge finds|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wKhWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=i-YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3621%2C2453964|quote=Mr Donald Bruce Mackay was murdered and disposed of by a Griffith-based organisation, Mr Justice Woodward found in his report.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Woodward, in his final report, concluded that the members of this organisation involved in Mackay's murder were Francesco Sergi (born 24 January 1935), Domenic Sergi (born 3 March 1939), Antonio Sergi (born 4 February 1950), Antonio Sergi (born 29 October 1935), Francesco Barbaro (born 8 September 1937) and Robert Trimbole (born 19 March 1931).&lt;ref name="bottom46"&gt;Bottom, ''Shadow of Shame'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Woodward requested for police to search Griffith's "grass castles" but this was denied.&lt;ref name="bottom"&gt;Bottom, ''Shadow of Shame'', p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath of Mackay's murder ==

In 1980, [[Al Grassby]] was charged with criminal [[defamation]] when it was alleged that he had asked New South Wales state politician [[Michael Maher (Australian politician)|Michael Maher]] to read in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] a document that imputed Mackay's wife Barbara and her family solicitor were responsible for Mackay's disappearance. An inquiry by John Nagle Q.C. found that "no decent man" could have spread the "scurrilous lies" that Grassby had.&lt;ref name="smh2009"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/monuments-to-honesty-and-deceit-20090215-881s.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Monuments to honesty and deceit | first=Paul | last=Sheehan | date=16 February 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grassby maintained his innocence and fought a 12-year battle in the courts before he was eventually acquitted on appeal in August 1992 and was awarded [[A$]]180,000 in costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heinrichs|first=Paul|title=Al Grassby, father of multiculturalism, dies|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Al-Grassby-father-of-multiculturalism-dies/2005/04/23/1114152363110.html|accessdate=19 May 2011|newspaper=The Age|date=24 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grassby had already lost a civil suit filed by Barbara Mackay, forcing him to unconditionally apologise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 June 1988|author=Jenny Cooke|page=11|title=Prosection appeals over Grassby decisions| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eK8yAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1440%2C81535|quote=Mr Williams – partly due to the lengthy delay in bringing the charge and the fact that Mrs Mackay already had won a civil suit with an unconditional apology from Mr Grassby – permanently stayed the criminal defamation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the coroner ruled Mackay had died of "wilfully inflicted gunshot wounds".&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last= Gregory |first= C. A. |year= 2000 |id= A150274b |title= Mackay, Donald Bruce (1933–1977) |accessdate= 19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 hitman James Frederick Bazley was charged over the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Malcolm|title=Dramatic Underbelly upsets those who were there|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/news/entertainment/tv--radio/dramatic-underbelly-upsets-those-who-were-there/2009/02/15/1234632646601.html|accessdate=19 May 2011|newspaper=WAtoday.com.au|date=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bazley claimed he was innocent, blaming allegedly corrupt former Sydney detective [[Fred Krahe]] as the killer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bellamy|first=Patrick|title=The Fixer: The Rise and Fall of Australian Drug Lord Robert Trimbole|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/robert_trimbole/5.html|accessdate=19 May 2011|work=truTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was convicted of conspiring with Gianfranco Tizzone, Robert Trimbole, George Joseph and unknown other persons to murder Mackay, as well as the murders of drug couriers Douglas and Isabel Wilson.&lt;ref name="twistingtrail" /&gt; He was sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

Gianfranco Tizzoni, who turned informer in 1983, admitted to his 'complicity' in Mackay's murder.&lt;ref name="bottom80"&gt;Bottom, ''Shadow of Shame'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Tizzoni admitted that he arranged for a hitman he knew as 'Fred' to undertake the contract.&lt;ref name="bottom85"&gt;Bottom, ''Shadow of Shame'', pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; When shown photographs of possible suspects, Tizzone fingered Bazley as the trigger man.&lt;ref name="bottom85" /&gt;

In July 2012, 35 years after his disappearance, the New South Wales police offered a $200,000 reward for information on the whereabouts of Mackay. The reward was considered a last-ditch attempt to gain evidence from reluctant witnesses. In particular those of Bazley, who is 86 and unwell. However, in the rare moments he has broken his silence, Bazley denied he was the killer.&lt;ref name="age140712"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/national/police-hope-200000-may-prise-open-the-secret-of-donald-mackays-grave-20120713-221ke.html Police hope $200,000 may prise open the secret of Donald Mackay's grave], The Age, 14 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008, the [[Rotary Club]] of Griffith erected a memorial in Banna Avenue, the main street of Griffith, to honour the 30th anniversary of Donald Mackay's murder.&lt;ref name="smh2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mackay's son pushes for bigger crime crackdown|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/10/13/2389532.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=19 May 2011|newspaper=ABC News|date=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue of Donald Mackay itself is a white [[bust (sculpture)|marble bust]] with a plaque inscribed with "All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.

The '''Elizabeth Morgan Act''' is an [[Act of Congress|act]] of the [[104th United States Congress]]. It was originally introduced as {{USBill|104|HR|1855}}, by Rep. [[Thomas M. Davis]]. It was passed as part of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 ({{USBill|104|HR|3675}}), {{USPL|104|205}}. The Elizabeth Morgan Act was declared unconstitutional as a [[bill of attainder]] in 2003&lt;ref&gt;''Doris R. Foretich, et al. v. United States'', 351 F.3d 1198 (D.C.App. 2003); Leonning, Carol D. "Appeals Court Rules Against Morgan Law," ''Washington Post'' 17 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Background==
In 1989, [[Frank Wolf (politician)|Rep. Frank Wolf]] introduced the bill that became the ''District of Columbia Civil Contempt Imprisonment Limitation Act'', {{USBill|101|HR|2136}}. That legislation was proposed to change a feature of District of Columbia law that permitted indefinite detention for civil contempt, such as had been experienced by Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, who was in contempt for refusing to allow her daughter unsupervised visitation with the child's father.&lt;ref&gt;H. Rpt. 101-98, Report to Accompany H.R. 2136, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; He again involved himself in the Elizabeth Morgan case when he co-sponsored the bill that became the Elizabeth Morgan Act.&lt;ref name="Associated Press"&gt;{{cite news|title=Court strikes down law passed for mother who hid daughter|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/12/16/jailed.mother.ap/|work=[[CNN]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=December 16, 2003 |accessdate=Jun 4, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203173505/http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/12/16/jailed.mother.ap/|archivedate=December 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passed in 1996, the Elizabeth Morgan Act permitted Hilary Foretich, who by then called herself Ellen Morgan, to decide whether or not to see her father.  The 14-year-old returned with her mother to the United States, but declined to see her father.  The father, Eric Foretich, sued in 1997, and the law was overturned as a [[bill of attainder]] by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] in 2003. This had no practical effect on Hilary, who was by then 21 and could choose for herself whether or not to see her father.&lt;ref name="Associated Press"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LAWEEKLY"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henry|first1=Emily|title=Morgan vs. Foretich Twenty Years Later|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-02-05/news/morgan-vs-foretich-twenty-years-later/|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=February 4, 2009|location=[[Los Angeles]] |accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=983770 |title=Family Law Armageddon: The Story of Morgan v.

"In particular, I remarked to Mike that Wikipedia inevitably will be overtaken by the gamers and the marketers to the point where it will lose all credibility....

'''Failure of consideration''' is a technical [[legal]] term referring to situations in which one person confers a benefit upon another upon some condition or basis ("[[consideration]]") which fails to materialise or subsist. It is also referred to as "failure of basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1479&amp;context=blr |author=Camp T |title=Restitution on a Partial Failure of Basis}} (2016) 28 Bond Law Review 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an '[[English unjust enrichment law|unjust factor]]' for the purposes of the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment]]. Where there is a "total failure of consideration" the claimant can seek restitution of the benefit by bringing an action in unjust enrichment against the defendant. Historically speaking, this was as a [[Quasi-contract|quasi-contractual]] claim known as an [[Money had and received|action for money had and received to the plaintiff's use]] for a consideration that wholly failed. The orthodox view is that it is necessary for any relevant contract to be ineffective, for example because it is discharged for [[Breach of contract|breach]], [[Void (law)|void]] ''ab initio'' (from the beginning) or [[Frustration in English law|frustrated]]. However, it will be available on a subsisting contract where it does not undermine the contractual allocation of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|153|2007|litigants=Coshott v Lenin |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure of consideration is a highly technical area of law. Particular areas of controversy include:
*Whether the failure of the consideration must be 'total',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UWALawRw/2006/6.pdf |last=Tarrant |first=J |title=Total Failure of Consideration}} (2006) 33(1) University of Western Australia Law Review 132.&lt;/ref&gt; and the scope and meaning of such a requirement;
*Whether 'consideration' refers not only to bargained-for counter-performance by the defendant, but also a legal or factual state of affairs;
*Whether this ground of restitution only applies to money claims or also extends to non-money benefits (e.g., [[Personal property|chattels]], services);  
*Whether this ground of restitution can be relied upon by a contract-breaker;
*Whether the (now ineffective) contract has any impact upon (a) the availability of a claim; or (b) the valuation of any such claim;  
*Whether a failure of consideration can also generate [[Unjust enrichment#Remedies for unjust enrichment: personal and proprietary restitution|proprietary remedies]] (e.g., a resulting trust);  
*Whether a claimant can elect to terminate a contract for breach and escape a 'bad bargain' by suing in unjust enrichment on the ground of total failure of consideration.

'''Fair chase''' is a term used by hunters to describe an ethical approach to hunting big game animals. North America's oldest wildlife conservation group, the [[Boone and Crockett Club]], defines "fair chase" as requiring hunted big game animals to be wild and free-ranging.&lt;ref name="Boone and Crockett Club"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Chase Statement|url=https://www.boone-crockett.org/huntingEthics/ethics_fairchase.asp?area=huntingEthics|website=Boone and Crockett Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Wild" refers to an animal that is naturally bred and lives in nature. "Free-ranging" means an animal that is not confined by artificial barriers.

Fair chase has been the honor code of North American hunters for over a century and the principle underlying many of North American hunting laws, and is taught to new hunters in hunter certification courses.

Fair Chase is also a registered trademark of the [[Boone and Crockett Club]].

==History==

The concept and the popularization of the term "fair chase" is credited to [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and perpetuated by the Boone and Crockett Club, a conservation organization of Roosevelt's creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes from first meeting of the Boone and Crockett Club|url=http://cdm103401.cdmhost.com/cdm/singleitem/collection/p16013coll13/id/51/rec/10|website=Montana Memory Project - University of Montana Mansfield Library|publisher=Boone and Crockett Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mauro|first1=Anthony|title=The New Age Hunter|date=2004|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|isbn=0-595-32316-2|page=35}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===European aristocratic roots===

Ethics, or a code of conduct, in hunting first emerged centuries ago among European hunters who were primarily the wealthy landowners and royalty. While the commoner hunted to stay alive, the aristocrat [[Sport hunting|hunted for sport]], and it was this sporting approach that separated the two. These ethics did not transfer to the majority of immigrants that settled in the [[New World]]. Basic human survival and commercial enterprises had no room for a hunting ethic. After two hundred years of the unregulated taking of wildlife by subsistence, recreational, and commercial market hunters, the negative effects were inescapable. By the end of this "era of extermination", wildlife and especially big game populations were in dismal condition. Some species had already been lost to extinction and many others were on the brink.

In the early part of the 20th century, a sense of pride and accomplishment began to emerge among sportsmen that came with their newly accepted responsibility to conserve. Doing right by the game being hunted meant working with conservation and population recovery efforts, including the creation of the [[National Wildlife Refuge System]]. As for the hunt itself, using restraint shifted the emphasis of measuring success from the quantity of game taken to the quality of the chase. The hunting experience became more important than the number killed, and success was now more memorable because the hunting experience became sustainable in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richard J. Ladle|first1=Robert J. Whittaker|title=Conservation Biogeography|date=2011|publisher=Blackwell Publishing LTD|location=West Sussex, UK|isbn=978-1-4443-3503-3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development and definition===

The earliest recorded North American usage of the term "fair chase" is in the fifth article of the Boone and Crockett Club constitution, adopted in February 1888. At this time in American history, there were no laws governing the talking of game for food or for sport. Water-killing deer (driving deer with hounds or pushers into lakes where hunters waited in boats to either shoot, club, or cut the throats of deer) was also a widespread practice, especially in the [[Adirondack Mountains]].

Article X of the club’s constitution declared that the killing of game while swimming was an "offense" for which a member may be suspended or expelled from the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boone and Crockett Archive|url=http://cdm103401.cdmhost.com/cdm/singleitem/collection/p16013coll13/id/96/rec/1|website=Montana Memory Project - University of Montana Mansfield Library|publisher=Boone and Crockett Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later writings by club members Roosevelt, [[George Bird Grinnell]], and [[Aldo Leopold]] articulated the term "fair chase" to the public through books and magazine articles. Most notable of these where the club’s Acorn book series on hunting (1893 – 1933), Leopold's ''[[Sand County Almanac]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leopold|first1=Aldo|title=Sand County Almanac|date=1942|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Grinnell’s ''[[Forest and Stream]]'' magazine (now ''[[Field &amp; Stream]]'').

In 1893, Roosevelt wrote about hunting and fair chase in his book titled ''The Wilderness Hunter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roosevelt|first1=Theodore|title=The Wilderness hunter|date=1893|publisher=G.P Putnam's Sons|location=New York, New York|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The teddy bear's connection===

The history of the [[teddy bear]] has a close connection to fair chase. During his presidency in 1902, Roosevelt was in Mississippi to settle a border dispute. His hosts knew Roosevelt was an avid hunter and arranged for a black bear hunt for the president. In the thick brush swamps of Mississippi it was a common practice of the day to hunt bears with hounds. Out of concern for the president's safety, the guides insisted that he stay in camp until a bear was brought to bay by the hounds, and subsequently a small bear was caught and tied to a tree. When Roosevelt arrived at the scene he refused to shoot the defenseless animal.&lt;ref name="Real Teddy Bear Story"/&gt;

Being omitted from the chase was unsettling to Roosevelt, who prided himself in living the hardy life of an [[outdoorsman]]—the harder the hunt the better—and he did not earn this bear though a fair pursuit. Political cartoonist [[Clifford Berryman]] immediately drew a cartoon depicting Roosevelt refusing to shoot the restrained bear. The story made national headlines and a shopkeeper, Morris Michtom in Brooklyn, New York, had his wife sew a stuffed bear to sell in his store. He wrote Roosevelt asking permission to call the child's toy, Teddy's Bear. Roosevelt gave his permission, and history was made.&lt;ref name="Real Teddy Bear Story"&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Teddy Bear Story|url=http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/site/c.elKSIdOWIiJ8H/b.8684621/k.6632/Real_Teddy_Bear_Story.htm|website=Theodore Roosevelt Association|publisher=Theodore Roosevelt Association|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fair chase today==

When in the field, the initial question for every fair chase hunter is whether the animal has a reasonable opportunity to elude the hunter. If the animal does not, the hunt can never be "fair chase". For example, a fair chase hunter does not shoot an animal hampered by deep snow or entangled in a barbed-wire fence.

There are also laws that regulate hunting. Ethical, fair chase hunting therefore begins with obeying game laws. A fair chase hunter must acquaint themselves with the laws that govern hunting, as they reflect considerations for safety, the sustainable use of the wildlife resources, and the minimum level of conduct that the public will tolerate in a particular state, province, region, or country. If something is illegal it cannot, by definition, be fair chase. On the other hand, just because something is legal does not make it fair chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posewitz|first1=James|title=Beyond Fair Chase|date=1994|publisher=Falcon Press Publishing|location=Helena, Montana|isbn=1-56044-302-2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are certain aspects of fair chase hunting that extend beyond written laws. For example, shooting at a running deer is not illegal, nor are there any laws regarding shooting at extremely long ranges with a firearm or bow. To those who believe in the responsibility to kill quickly and cleanly, taking such risky shots would be unethical. A large part of the time-honored tradition of hunting has to do with the fact that sportsmen police themselves and others both within and beyond the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posewitz|first1=James|title=Beyond Fair Chase|date=1994|publisher=Falcon Press Publishing|location=Helena, Montana|isbn=1-56044-302-2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

"Canned shoots", also known as "[[canned hunting]]", may be legal in some North American states and provinces, but they are not representative of fair chase. Canned shoots involve the "pursuit" and killing of a big game animal kept in or released from captivity to be shot in an artificial hunting situation where a kill is virtually guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeMello|first1=Margo|title=Animals and Society: An Introduction to Human-Animal Studies|date=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15294-5|page=74}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Internet hunting]] was introduced in 2005, allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns, the practice was widely criticized by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase. As a representative of the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) explained, "The NRA has always maintained that fair chase, being in the field with your firearm or bow, is an important element of hunting tradition. Sitting at your desk in front of your computer, clicking at a mouse, has nothing to do with hunting."&lt;ref name=HSUS-FactSheet&gt;Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, [http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/internet_hunting/facts/internet_hunting_fact_sheet.html#.UzjiW61dW9Y Fact Sheet on Internet Hunting]&lt;/ref&gt;

One hunting club declares that a fair chase shall not involve the taking of animals under the following conditions:
* Helpless in a trap, deep snow or water, or on ice.
* From any power vehicle or power boat.
* By "[[spotlighting|jacklighting]]" or shining at night.
* By the use of any tranquilizers or poisons.
* While inside escape-proof fenced enclosures.
* By the use of any power vehicle or power boat for herding or driving animals, including use of aircraft to land alongside or to communicate with or direct a hunter on the ground.
* By the use of electronic devices for attracting, locating or pursuing game or guiding the hunter to such game, or by the use of a bow or arrow to which any electronic device is attached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pope-young.org/bowhunting_fairchase.asp |title=The Rules of Fair Chase |publisher=[[Pope and Young Club]] |location=[[Chatfield, Minnesota]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67uAifKEP?url=http://www.pope-young.org/bowhunting_fairchase.asp |archivedate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 May 2012 |quote=While inside escape-proof fenced enclosures |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8232">'''False self-employment''' is a situation in which somebody registered as [[self-employed]], a [[freelancer]], or a [[Temporary work|temp]] is de facto an [[employee]] carrying out a professional activity under the authority and subordination of another company.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Beyens and Valery Vermeulen, [http://www.droitbelge.be/fiches_detail.asp?idcat=25&amp;id=211 Le faux indépendant], DroitBelge.net, accessed 15 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Such false self-employment is often a way to circumvent social welfare and employment legislation, for example by avoiding employer's social security and income tax contributions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hudsoncontract.co.uk/news-resources/2016/jan/what-is-false-self-employment/&lt;/ref&gt; While a modern "gig economy" encourages more casual employment practices in the interests of labour flexibility, the extent to which this disguises precarious employment and denial of rights is of growing concern to authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Booth, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/hmrc-launch-crackdown-gig-economy-firms-agency-self-employed-staff Ministers order HMRC crackdown on ‘gig economy’ firms], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Oct. 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Houlder and Sarah O’Connor, [https://www.ft.com/content/9228e40a-976d-11e6-a80e-bcd69f323a8b Revenue cracks down on ‘false self-employment’], ''[[Financial Times]]'', Oct. 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a grey area of self-employed persons who rely heavily on a single customer while legitimately being independent.&lt;ref&gt;U. Muehlberger, ''Dependent Self-Employment: Workers on the Border between Employment and Self-Employment'' (Palgrave, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==
A salaried-work relation hidden behind a false pretense of self-employment is in some jurisdictions a violation of and a non‑compliance with labour law.

For social security, the falsely self-employed is declared not to be subject to employment law, but actually works under an employer’s authority in a [[:fr:Lien de subordination en droit du travail français|subordinate relationship]], with the same conditions as his salaried colleagues but without any [[employment contract]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.droitbelge.be/fiches_detail.asp?idcat=25&amp;id=211 Pierre Beyens, avocat au barreau de Bruxelles auprès de van Cutsem Wittamer Marnef &amp; Partners]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a salaried-work relation is hidden under such a false pretense, there is a violation of law and both parties expose themselves to sanctions.

The constitutive elements of an employment contract typically are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.droitbelge.be/fiches_detail.asp?idcat=25&amp;id=211 Pierre Beyens, avocat au barreau de Bruxelles auprès de van Cutsem Wittamer Marnef &amp; Partners]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Work performed;
* for [[remuneration]];
* in a subordinate relationship.

== In Belgium ==
The (Belgian) legislator considers the following elements to define a subordinate relationship:
# No worker’s participation in the company’s profits or losses;
# No proper capital investments in the company;
# No responsibility or decision‑taking power in the company;
# The certainty of getting a regular payment;
# The fact of having just a single and unique customer company;
# The fact of having no personal workers/the fact of not being an employer;
# The fact of not being able to organise one’s working period;
# The existence of in-house control procedures, with related sanctions;
# No decision‑taking power concerning customers’ invoicing.
[[Labour law]] tends in a jurisprudential way to view self-employment as false when many of the above elements are present.

The ministers’ council (the Belgian Cabinet) on 5 May 2006 examined a legislative proposal (a bill) which no longer refers to a “faux indépedant” (read: falsely self-employed person), but to "qualification adequate de la nature des relations de travail" ("appropriate qualification about the nature of relationships at work"), whether salaried or independent. The bill came from the minister of small business, [[Sabine Laruelle]] (MR political party – liberal), and the minister of social affairs, [[Rudy Demotte]] (PS political party – socialist). The governmental declaration of July 2004 already planned such a bill.

The legislative proposal confirms the general principles stated by the jurisprudence and the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]]: to have an employment contract, there must be a relationship of authority and subordination; (and) to have a contract between independent actors, there must be no such relationship. This reflects the party’s intention as expressed in their programme. Elements such as freedom to organise one’s working time/period, freedom to organise one's work and the possibility to have a hierarchical control allow to evaluate the existence or not of any hierarchical relationship.

Moreover, this establishes legal certainty: the current system of freedom of contract between parties is confirmed, the potential problems are framed either in specific sectors, or in individual situations.

==In Britain==
===Construction industry===
A British trade union [[UCATT]] which specialized in the construction industry has expressed concern that false self-employment was being used by many British employers to evade taxes and engage workers without having to respect employment rights and entitlements such as holiday pay, sick pay and pensions. In their opinion, whilst the practice was immoral, it was not, in their view, necessarily illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucatt.org.uk/false-self-employment|title=False Self Employment|publisher=UCATT/Unite union UK|accessdate =2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The UK taxation arrangement known as the  Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)  allowed registered companies to deduct tax at source and thus avoid employing workers directly as their regular or casual employee who would thus have acquired legal employee rights.

Instead casual staff could be assumed to be sub-contractors who were falsely supposed to be self-employed, and thus responsible for paying their own tax and social security contributions.

If such persons were not registered as self-employed, they would thereby be liable for unlawfully evading their legal obligations.

===Offshore Oil===
The British Government’s [[HM Revenue and Customs]] service found in 2013  evidence that some companies and employment businesses connected with the [[North Sea oil|offshore oil industry]] were using [[Employment Agencies Act 1973|employment intermediaries]] to disguise the employment of their workers as self-employment, primarily to avoid paying employers [[National Insurance]] contributions  and to reduce the costs associated with [[Employment Rights Act 1996|workers’ employment rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/onshore-employment-intermediaries-false-self-employment HM Revenue and Customs:Onshore employment intermediaries: false self-employment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
The Spanish Ministry of Employment is trying (as of mid August 2017) to address commercial accounting agencies who invoice employers on behalf of regular employees falsely presented self-employed persons to evade or minimise their tax and social security obligations (Self employed people are known as autónomos in Spanish, and usually raise their own invoices for irregular work assignments themselves). Fidelis Factu Sociedad Cooperativa, better known as Factoo, has been obliged to close its operation following a sanction imposed by the Ministry. There are known to be several other cooperatives of this type, although Factoo is the largest so far identified and the first to be shut down.&lt;ref&gt;[https://economia.elpais.com/economia/2017/08/17/actualidad/1502980859_019100.html#?ref=rss&amp;format=simple&amp;link=link El País Spanish newspaper:Empleo pone coto a las falsas cooperativas de autónomos y obliga a cerrar Factoo]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formularies''' (singular '''formulary'''; Latin ''littera(e) formularis, -ares'') are medieval collections of models for the execution of documents (acta), public or private; a space being left for the insertion of names, dates, and circumstances peculiar to each case. Their modern equivalent are [[form (document)|forms]].

==Rationale==
It is practically inevitable that documents of the same nature, issued from the same office, or even from distinct offices, will bear a close resemblance to one another. Those charged with the execution and expedition of such documents come naturally to employ the same formulæ in similar cases; moreover, the use of such formulæ permits the drafting of important documents to be entrusted to minor officials, since all they have to do is to insert in the allotted space the particular information previously supplied them. Finally, in this way every document is clothed with all possible efficiency, since each of its clauses, and almost every word, has a meaning clearly and definitely intended. Uncertainties and difficulties of interpretation are thus avoided, and not infrequently lawsuits. This legal formalism is usually known as the "style" or habitual diction of chanceries and the documents that issue therefrom. It represents long efforts to bring into the document all necessary and useful elements in their most appropriate order, and to use technical expressions suited to the case, some of them more or less essential, others merely as a matter of tradition. In this way arose a true art of drafting public documents or private acta, which became the monopoly of chanceries and notaries, which the mere layman could only imperfectly imitate, and which in time developed to such a point that the mere "style" of a supposititious deed has often been sufficient to enable a skilful critic to detect the forgery.

==Early history==
The earlier Roman notaries (''tabelliones'') had their own traditional formulæ, and the drafting of their acta was subject to an infinity of detail;&lt;ref&gt;See "Novels" of [[Justinian]], xliv, lxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; the imperial chanceries of Rome and Byzantium were more remarkable still for their formulæ. The chanceries of the barbarian kingdoms and that of the papacy followed in their footsteps. Nevertheless it is usually not directly from the chanceries that the formularies drawn up in the Middle Ages have come down to us, but rather from the monastic and ecclesiastical schools. Therein was taught, as pertaining to the study of law, the art of drafting public and private documents.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Du Cange]], "Glossarium med. et infimæ Latinitatis", s. v. "Dictare"&lt;/ref&gt; It was called ''dictare'' as opposed to ''scribere'', i. e. the mere material execution of such documents.

To train the ''dictatores'', as they were known, specimens of public and private acta were placed before them, and they had to listen to commentaries thereon. Thus arose the yet extant formularies, between the 5th and the 9th centuries. These models were sometimes of a purely academic nature, but their number is small; in almost every case they are taken from real documents, in the transcription of which the individualizing references were suppressed so as to make them take on the appearance of general formulæ; in many instances nothing was suppressed.
 
The formulæ deal with public documents: royal decrees on civil matters, ordinances etc.; with documents relative to legal processes and the administration of justice; or with private deeds drawn up by a notary: sales, exchanges, gifts to churches and monasteries, transference of ecclesiastical property, the manumission of slaves, the settlement of matrimonial dowries, the execution of wills etc. Finally, there are deeds which refer solely to ecclesiastical concerns: consecrations of churches, blessings of various kinds, excommunications, etc.
 
The study of the medieval formularies is of importance for the history of legislation, the rise of institutions, the development of manners and customs, of civil history, above all for the criticism of charters and diplomas, and for researches in medieval philology. In those times the ecclesiastical and civil orders were closely related. Many civil functions and some of the highest state offices were held by ecclesiastics and monks. The ''[[ars dictandi]]'' was taught in the schools connected with the monasteries and those under ecclesiastical control. For quite a long time all acta were drawn up only in [[Latin]], and as the [[vernacular]] languages, in Romance lands, gradually fell away from classical Latin, recourse to ecclesiastics and monks became a matter of necessity. The formularies are of course anything but models of good Latinity; with the exception of the Letters (Variæ) of [[Cassiodorus]], and the St. Gall collection "Sub Salomone", they are written in careless or even barbarous Latin, though it is possible that their wretched "style" is intentional, so as to render them intelligible to the multitude.

The formularies of the Middle Ages date from the 6th to the 9th or 10th century, and we still possess many once used in one or other of the barbarian kingdoms. Many were edited in the 17th century by [[Jérôme Bignon]], [[Baluze]], [[Mabillon]] and others; and many more in the 19th century, especially by two savants who compiled collections of them: 
*[[Eugène de Rozière]], "Recueil général des formules usitées dans l'empire des Francs du cinquième au dixième siècle" (3 vols., Paris, 1859–71). He groups these early medieval formulæ under five principal heads: "Formulæ ad jus publicum, ad jus privatum, ad judiciorum ordinem, ad jus canonicum, et ad ritus ecclesiasticos spectantes". And he follows up this arrangement by a very complete set of tables of concordance.
*[[Karl Zeumer]], "Formulæ Merovingici et Karolini ævi" (Hanover, 1886) in ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'': Leg.", V; he reproduces the formulæ in the work and gives a more complete study than de Rozière. In his pages will be found a complete bibliography of all written on the subject before that time; or [[knight|Chevalier]], "Topo-Bibl.", may be consulted under the word "Formules".

==Various post-Roman traditions==
Some brief observations will here suffice on the formulæ used between the 6th and the 9th centuries in the various barbarian kingdoms.

# The [[Ostrogoths]] - Cassiodorus, secretary and afterwards prime minister of King [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]], included in his "Variarum (epistolarum) libri XII", particularly in books six and seven, and, as he says, for the guidance of his successors, a great number of acta and letters drawn up by him for his royal master. It is a genuine formulary, though standing apart by itself. This collection dates from before 538 (P. L., LXIX). The Servite Canciani took ninety-two of these formulæ of Cassiodorus and included them in his "Barbarorum leges antiquæ" (Venice, 1781, I, 19-56).
# The [[Visigoths]] - " Formulæ Visigothicæ", a collection of the forty-Six formulæ made under King [[Sisebut]] (612-621). The king's name occurs twice in the curious formula xx, a dowry settlement in hexameter verse. Roman and Gothic law are followed either separately or together, according to the nationality of the covenanters. This collection was published in 1854 by de Rozière from a Madrid Manuscript, which was copied in turn from an Oviedo Manuscript of the 12th century, now lost.
# The Franks' formularies are numerous:
## "Formulæ Andecavenses", a collection made at Angers, consisting of sixty formulæ for private acta, some of them dating from the 6th century, but the greater number from the early part of the seventh; the last three of the collection belong to the end of the 7th century. They were first edited in 1685 by Mabillon from an 8th-century manuscript preserved at Fulda.
## "Formulæ Arvernenses" (also known as "Baluzianæ",from Baluze, their first editor, who issued the works in 1713), a collection of eight formulæ of private acta made at Clermont in Auvergne during the 8th century. The first of them is dated from the consulate of Honorius and Theodosius (407- 422).
## "Marculfi monachi formularum libri duo", the most important of these collections, and dedicated by the author, [[Marculf]], to a Bishop Landri, doubtless identical with [[Landry of Paris|Landericus]], the [[Bishop of Paris]] (650-656). The first book contains thirty-seven formulæ of royal documents; the second, cartœ pagenses, or private acta, to the number of fifty-two. The work, which was well done, was very favourably received, and became popular as an official textbook, if not in the time of the mayors of the palace, at least under the early Carolingians. During the reign of Charlemagne it received a few additions, and was re-arranged under the title" Formulæ Marculfinæ ævi Karolini". Zeumer edited six formulæ closely related to this collection.
## "Formulæ Turonenses", also known as "Sirmondicæ"&lt;ref&gt;Baluze edited them under this title because they had been discovered by Père Sirmond in a Langres manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; This collection, made at Tours, contains forty-five formulæ, two of which are royal documents, many being judicial decisions, and the remainder private acta. It seems to belong to the middle of the 8th century. Zeumer added to the list twelve other formulæ taken from various manuscripts.
## "Formulæ Bituricenses", a name given to nineteen formulæ taken from different collections, but all drafted at Bourges; they date from 720 to the close of the 8th century. [[Zeumer]] added to them twelve formulæ taken from the Abbey of Saint-Pierre de Vierzon.
## "Formulæ Senonenses", two distinct collections, both of which were made at Sens, and preserved in the same 9th-century manuscript. The first, "Cartæ Senonicæ", dates from before 775, and contains fifty-one formulæ, of which seven are for royal documents, two are letters to the king, and forty-two are private charters. Zeumer added six Merovingian formulæ. The second collection, "Formulæ Senonenses recentiores", dates from the reign of Louis the Pious, and contains eighteen formulæ, of which seven deal with judicial acts. Zeumer added five metrical formulæ, and two Merovingian formulæ written in [[Tironian notes]].
## "Formulæ Pithoei" In a manuscript loaned by Pithou to Du Cange for his "Glossarium" of medieval Latin there was a rich collection of at least one hundred and eight formulæ, drawn up originally in territory governed by Salic law. This manuscript has disappeared. Under the above heading Zeumer has collected the various quotations made by Du Cange from this formulary.
## "Formulæ Salicæ Bignonianæ", so called from the name of their first editor, Bignon. It contains twenty-seven formulæ, one of which is for a royal decree; they were collected in a country subject to Salic law, about the year 770.
## "Formulæ Salicæ Merkelianæ", so called from the name of their editor, Merkel (about 1850), a collection of sixty-six formulæ taken from a Vatican manuscript; they were not brought to completion until after 817. The first part (1-30) consists of formulæ for private acta, modelled on "Marculf" and the "Formulæ Turonenses"; the second part (31-42) follows the "Formulæ Bignonianæ", the third (43-45) contains three formulæ drawn up in some abbey; the fourth (46-66) has formulæ dating from the close of the 8th century and probably compiled in some episcopal town. Two formulæ of decrees of the bishops of Paris were discovered by Zeumer in the same manuscript.
## "Formulæ Salicæ Lindenbrogianæ", so called from the name of their first editor, Friedrich Lindenbrog, a Frankfort lawyer (1613) who edited them together with other documents. The collection contains twenty-one formulæ of private acta, drawn up in Salic law territory. Four others were added by Zeumer.
## "Formulæ Imperiales e curia Ludovici Pii", also known as "Carpenterianæ" from [[Pierre Carpentier]] who first edited them in his "Alphabetum Tironianum" (Paris, 1747). This is an important collection of fifty-five formulæ, drawn up after the fashion of the charters of Louis the Pious at the Abbey of St. Martin of Tours, between 828 and 832, The manuscript is written mainly in Tironian notes. This collection was used by the Carolingian [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] of the 9th century. Zeumer has added to the list two formulæ.
## "Collectio Flaviniensis", one hundred and seventeen formulæ compiled at the Abbey of Flavigny in the 9th century; of these, ten only are not to be met with elsewhere.
## "Formulæ collectionis Sancti Dionysii", a collection of twenty-five formulæ made at the [[Abbey of St-Denys]] under [[Charlemagne]]; for the most part it is taken from the archives of the abbey.
## "Formulæ codicis Laudunensis", a [[Laon]] (Picardy) manuscript containing seventeen formulæ, of which the first five were drawn up at the Abbey of St-Bavon in Ghent, and the remainder at Laon.
# The most important of the [[Alamanni]] formulæ are:
## "Formulæ Alsaticæ", under which name we have two collections, one made at the [[Abbey of Murbach]] (Formulæ Morbacenses) at the end of the 8th century and preserved in a manuscript of St.Gall, containing twenty-seven formulæ, one of which is for a royal decree; the other embodies three formulæ made at Strasburg (Formulæ Argentinenses) and preserved in a Berne manuscript.
## "Formulæ Augienses", from the [[Abbey of Reichenau]], consisting of three distinct collections: one from the end of the 8th century containing twenty-three formulæ of private acta; another belonging to the 8th and 9th centuries contains forty-three formulæ of private documents; the third, "Formulæ epistolares Augienses", is a "correct letter-writer" with twenty-six formulæ.
## "Formulæ Sangallenses" (from the [[Abbey of St. Gall]]), in two collections of this name. The "Formulæ Sangallenses miscellaneæ" consists of twenty-five formulæ, many of which are accompanied by directions for their use. They date from the middle of the eighth to the end of the 9th century. The important "Collectio Sangallensis Salomonis III tempore conscripta" is so called because it seems to have been compiled by the monk [[Notker of St. Gall]], under Abbot Salomon III (890-920), who was also [[Bishop of Constance]]. Notker died in 912. It contains in forty-seven formulæ models of royal decrees, private documents, litterae formatae and other episcopal documents. Zeumer added six formulæ taken from the same manuscript.
# Among the Bavarian formulæ are:
## "Formulæ Salisburgenses", a very fine collection of one hundred and twenty-six models of documents and letters, published in 1858 by Rockinger, and drawn up at [[Salzburg]] in the early part of the 9th century.
## "Collectio Pataviensis" (of [[Passau]]), containing seven formulæ, five of which are of royal decrees, executed at Passau under [[Louis the German]].
## "Formulæ codicis S. Emmerami", fragments of a large collection made at [[St. Emmeram]]'s at [[Regensburg]] (Ratisbon).
# In Rome the most important of all ancient formularies is certainly the ''[[Liber diurnus romanorum pontificum]]'', a collection of one hundred and seven formularies long used by the [[Apostolic chancery]]. If it was not drawn up for the papal chancery but copies its documents and is largely compiled from the "Registrum" or letter-book of [[St. Gregory the Great]] (590-604). It was certainly in official use by the Roman chancery from the ninth to the end of the 11th century. This collection was known to the medieval canonists, and is often quoted by Cardinal Deusdedit and [[St. Yves of Chartres]]; four of its documents were incorporated into the "Decretum" of Gratian. The best manuscript of the "Liber diurnus", written at the beginning of the 9th century, comes from the Roman monastery of [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] and was discovered in the Vatican Library. About the middle of the 17th century, the learned [[Lucas Holstenius]] used it when preparing an edition of the work which was officially stopped and suppressed on the eve of its appearance, because it contained an ancient profession of faith in which the popes anathematized their predecessor Honorius. In 1680 the Jesuit [[Jean Garnier]], using another manuscript of the College of Clermont (Paris), brought out an edition of the "Liber diurnus" not approved by Rome (P. L., CV).

In the 19th century the Vatican manuscript was utilized for two editions, one by [[de Rozière]] (Paris, 1869), the other by [[von Sickel]] (Vienna, 1889). In 1891 the [[Abbate Ceriani]] discovered at the Ambrosiana (Milan) a third manuscript as yet unused. For a full bibliography of recent researches concerning the "Liber diurnus" see the "Topo-Bibl." of Chevalier, s. v. While, in its complete form, the "Liberdiurnus" cannot date back further than 786, the earliest forms of it go back to the end of the 7th century. Von Sickel holds that its opening formulæ (1-63) are even fifty years earlier than that date. It is badly arranged as a collection, but wonderfully complete. After a series of addresses and conclusions for papal letters, varied according to the addressees, there are formulæ concerning the installation of bishops, the consecration of churches, the administration of church property, the grant of the pallium and various other privileges. Then follow models for the official correspondence on the occasion of a vacancy of the Holy See and the election of a pope, also directions for the consecration and the profession of faith of the pope-elect; finally a group of formulæ affecting various matters of ecclesiastical administration.

==Later history==
In the 10th century these formularies cease to be in universal use; in the eleventh, recourse is had to them still more rarely; other methods of training notaries are introduced. Copies of letters are no longer placed before them. In their stead, special treatises of instruction are prepared for these officials, and manuals of epistolary rhetoric appear, with examples scattered here and there throughout the text, or collected in separate books. Such treatises on composition, ''[[ars dictaminis|artes dictaminis]]'', have hitherto been only partially studied and classified, notably by [[Ludwig Rockinger]] in "Briefsteller und Formelbücher des XI. bis XIV. Jahrhunderts" (Munich, 1863). The most ancient of these manuals known to us is the "Breviarium de dictamine" of [[Alberic of Monte Cassino]], about 1075; in the 12th century treatises of this kind become more frequent, first in Italy, then in France, especially along the Loire at [[Orléans]] and at [[Tours]].
 
Side by side with these works of epistolary rhetoric we meet special treatises for the use of clerks in different chanceries, and formularies to guide notaries public. Such are the "Formularium tabellionum" of [[Irnerius of Bologna]] in the 12th century, and the "Summa artis notariæ" of [[Ranieri of Perugia]] in the thirteenth; that of [[Salathiel of Bologna]] printed at Strasburg, in 1516, and the very popular one of Rolandino that went through many editions, beginning with the Turin edition of 1479.

At the [[papal chancery]], in general very faithful to its customs and its "style", after the reform of [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] many formularies and practical treatises appeared, none of them possessing an official value. The writings of [[Dietrich of Nieheim]] (an employee of the chancery in 1380), "De Stilo" and "Liber Cancellariæ", have been the subject of critical studies. At a more recent date we meet many treatises on the Roman chancery and on pontifical letters, but they are not formularies, though their text often contains many models.

However there has appeared an official publication of certain formulæ of the Roman Curia, i. e. the collection of formulæ for matrimonial dispensations granted by the ''[[Dataria Apostolica]]'', published in 1901 as "Formulæ Apostolicæ Datariæ pro matrimonialibus dispensationibus, jussu Emi. Card. Pro Datarii Cajetani Aloisi-Masella reformatæ".

Lastly, in a different order of ideas it may be well to mention a collection of formulæ for use in episcopal courts, the "Formularium legalepracticum" of Francesco Monacelli (Venice, 1737), re-edited by the Camera Apostolica (3 vols. fol., Rome, 1834).

From the 12th century onward the formularies of the [[papal Curia]] become more numerous but less interesting, since it is no longer necessary to have recourse to them to supplement the documents.

The formularies of the [[Cancellaria Apostolica]] are collections drawn up by its clerks, almost exclusively for their own guidance; they interest us only through their relation to the "Rules of the Chancery". The formularies of the [[Poenitentiaria]] have a higher interest for us; they appear during the 12th century when that department of Roman administration was not yet restricted to questions of conscience and the forum internum, but served as a sort of clearing-house for lesser favours granted by the Holy See, especially for [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]]s. These interesting documents, including the formularies, have been collected and edited by Göller in "Die papstliche Poenitentiarie bis Eugen IV." (Rome, 1907).

Previously, Lea had published "A Formulary of the Papal Penitentiary in the Thirteenth Century" (Philadelphia, 1892), probably the work of [[Cardinal Thomasius of Capua]] (died 1243). The "Summa de absolutionibus et dispensationibus" of [[Pope Nicholas IV|Nicholas IV]] is also important; of particular value also is the formulary of [[Benedict XII]] (1336 at the latest), made by order of that pope and long in use. It contains five hundred and seventy letters of which more than two hundred are taken from the collection of Thomasius. Attention is also directed to the list of "faculties" conferred, in 1357, on [[Cardinal Albornoz]], first edited by [[Lecacheux]] in "Mélanges d'Archéologie et d'Histoire des écoles françaises de Rome et d'Athènes", in 1898; and to later texts in [[Göller]]. We make a bare mention of the taxœ or "taxes" in use at the [[Poenitentiaria]], to which were occasionally joined those imposed by the Cancellaria; presumably they are not in any way related to the formularies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6909">A '''gold cyanidation ban''' refers to the legislation that bans [[gold mining|mining gold]] through the [[gold cyanidation]] technique. 

Germany, Czech Republic, Hungary and Costa Rica have such bans, as well as the US states of Montana and Wisconsin and several Argentine provinces.

==Americas==
===Argentina===
A number of Argentine provinces banned cyanide mining, but there is no ban at the federal level.

* [[Chubut Province]] banned both the cyanide mining as well as open-pit mining to extract metals (law 5001/August 5, 2003)&lt;ref name="Rodriguez245"&gt;Rodriguez et al., p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Río Negro Province]] banned the usage of cyanides in the extraction, development and industrialization of metals (law 3981/July 21, 2005)&lt;ref name="Rodriguez245"/&gt;
* [[Tucumán Province]] banned both the cyanide mining as well as open-pit mining to extract metals (law 7879/April 20, 2007)&lt;ref name="Rodriguez245"/&gt;
* [[Mendoza Province]] banned the usage of cyanides in the exploration, prospecting, development and industrialization of metals (law 7722/June 20, 2007)&lt;ref name="Rodriguez245"/&gt;
* [[La Pampa Province]] banned open-pit mining to extract metals, as well as the usage of cyanides for prospecting, exploring, developing, extracting, storing and industrializing metals obtained through any extraction method, (law 2349/August 16, 2007)&lt;ref name="Rodriguez245"/&gt;
* [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Cordoba Province]] banned open-pit mining to extract metals, as well as using cyanides for prospecting, exploring, developing, extracting, storing and industrializing metals (law 9526/September 24, 2008)&lt;ref name="Rodriguez245"/&gt;
* [[San Luis Province]] banned the usage of cyanides in prospecting, exploration, developing and industrializing metals (law 634/January 10, 2008)&lt;ref name="Rodriguez245"/&gt;
* [[La Rioja Province, Argentina|La Rioja Province]] banned the usage of cyanides to extract metals (law 8137/August 3, 2007), however the ban was repealed (law 8355/September 26, 2008)&lt;ref name="Rodriguez245"/&gt;

===Costa Rica===
In 2002, [[Costa Rica]] passed a moratorium on open-pit cyanide-leach mining.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez243"&gt;Rodriguez et al., p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The US state of [[Montana]] banned open pit heap leaching and vat leaching using cyanide for gold mining following a citizen's initiative, Initiative 137, proposed by the Montana Environmental Information Center that was approved through a referendum on November 6, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://meic.org/issues/mining-in-montana/hardrock-and-cyanide-mining-in-montana/ban-on-cyanide-mining-in-montana-with-initiative-137/ |title=Ban on Cyanide Mining in Montana with Initiative 137 |date= |website=Montana Environmental Information Center |publisher= |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was codified in MCA 82-4-390. In the ''Seven Up Pete Venture v. State'' case, the Supreme Court of Montana found that the ban does not constitute a violation of the [[Contract Clause]] of the [[US Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Rodriguez241"&gt;Rodriguez et al., p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

The US state of [[Wisconsin]] banned in 2001 the usage of cyanides for mining or ore processing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2001/related/proposals/ab95 2001 Assembly BILL 95], [[Wisconsin State Assembly]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Summit, Colorado|Summit]], [[Costilla County, Colorado|Costilla]], [[Gunnison, Colorado|Gunnison]], [[Conejos, Colorado|Conejos]] and [[Gilpin County, Colorado|Gilpin]] counties in [[Colorado]] banned cyanide mining.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez241"/&gt; However, the [[Colorado Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Colorado Mining Association v. Board of Commissioners of Summit County'' that the counties, as subdivisions of the state, may not ban chemicals allowed by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Act.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez241"/&gt;

The voters of [[Lawrence County, South Dakota|Lawrence County]], [[South Dakota]] voted for a local ordinance banning new permits for surface mining on public land in a national forest. This was meant to ban extraction of gold and silver in the [[Spearfish Canyon]] area of the [[Black Hills National Forest]]. The courts decided in the ''South Dakota Mining Association Inc. v. Lawrence County'' that the federal law (which encourages exploration, mining and extraction of valuable minerals) overrides county regulations.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez242"&gt;Rodriguez et al., p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
===European Union===
The [[European Parliament]] voted in 2010 a [[Resolution (law)|motion for a resolution]] urging the [[European Commission]] to initiate a complete ban of cyanide mining,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION&amp;reference=B7-2010-0240&amp;language=EN Motion For A Resolution: B7-0240/2010], [[European Parliament]]&lt;/ref&gt; however the European Commission refused to propose legislation to implement such a ban. [[Janez Potočnik]], European Commissioner for Environment, argued that a ban would not be "justified from environmental and health point of views" and that closing down gold mines using cyanides in Europe would be "detrimental to employment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=P-2010-3589&amp;language=EN Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission], [[European Parliament]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===
In 2002, the Czech Parliament decided to ban gold cyanide leaching.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez242"&gt;Rodriguez et al., p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In 2006, Germany established a gradual reduction of allowed cyanides in mining.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez242"/&gt;

===Hungary===
In December 2009, the [[Hungarian Parliament]] voted for a complete ban of cyanide mining in the country following a campaign organized by the "Cyanide-Free Hungary!" coalition which was organized following the [[2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill]] which affected Hungary's rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Great victory against cyanide for gold mining |first=Stephanie |last=Roth |url=http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/other_comments/394395/great_victory_against_cyanide_for_gold_mining.html |newspaper=[[The Ecologist]] |date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
In 2007, the [[Turkish Council of State]] decided not to allow cyanide mining due to the article 56 of the [[Turkish Constitution]] that guarantees the right of people to live in a healthy environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2478">'''The Japan–Korea Treaty of 1885''', also known as the {{nihongo|'''Treaty of Hanseong'''|漢城条約|Kanjō Jōyaku|lead=yes}} with Hanseong ({{korean|hangul=한성|hanja=漢城}}) being a historical name for [[Seoul]], was negotiated between Japan and Korea following an unsuccessful [[coup d'état]] in the Korean capital in December 1884.

==Background==
A coup d'état, also known as the [[Gapsin Coup]], was attempted on December 4, 1884.&lt;ref&gt;The Gapsin Coup takes its name from the traditional Korean [[sexagenary cycle]] of dating. "Gapsin" is a counterpart to the year 1884 in the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The timing of the coup took advantage of the fact that the Chinese withdrew half of its garrison troops from Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Chun-gil. (2005). {{Google books|hauDIGtLbnsC|''The History of Korea,'' p. 109.|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After only three days, the revolt was suppressed by Chinese military forces which were garrisoned in the Korean capital city of [[Seoul|Hanseong]] ([[Seoul]]).  During the conflict, the Japanese legation building was burned down, and forty Japanese were killed.

[[Inoue Kaoru]] was the chief Japanese diplomat in dealings with Korea.  Diplomatic negotiations were concluded in January 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Duus, Peter. (1995). {{Google books|DZaizVa8oAAC|''The Abacus and the Sword: The Japanese Penetration of Korea, 1895-1910,'' p. 84.|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty provisions==
The Japanese government demanded and received an apology and reparations.

==Aftermath==
In an effort to defuse tensions over Korea, both Japan and China agreed to withdraw their troops from Korea in the [[Convention of Tientsin]] of April 1885.

'''''Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission''''' (2008) C-402/05 is an [[EU law]] case, concerning the hierarchy between international law and general principles of EU law.

==Facts==
[[Mr Kadi]], a [[Saudi]] resident with assets in [[Sweden]], and Al Barakaat, a charity for Somali refugees, claimed that his assets being frozen was unlawful. Their property was seized without any court hearing or right of redress or allegation of wrongdoing. The [[UN Security Council]] adopted resolutions under Chapter VII to freeze assets of people and groups associated with the Taliban and [[Osama Bin Laden]]. The EU adopted Regulations to give effect. Sweden had given effect to the Regulation. The claimants were named in the Resolution and Regulation. They claimed the Regulation should be annulled under [[TFEU]] article 263 and it was a breach of human rights.

==Judgment==

===Advocate General Opinion===
In the Opinion of [[Advocate General Maduro]], EU law did not need to unconditionally bow to international law, if the consequence could be a violation of basic constitutional principles.

{{Cquote|21. This brings us to the question of how the relationship between the International legal order and the Community legal order must be described. The logical starting point of our discussion should, of course, be the landmark ruling in ''[[Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen|Van Gend en Loos]]'', in which the Court affirmed the autonomy of the Community legal order. The Court held that the Treaty is not merely an agreement between States, but an agreement between the peoples of Europe. It considered that the Treaty had established a 'new legal order', beholden to, but distinct from the existing legal order of [[public international law]]. In other words, the Treaty has created a municipal legal order of trans-national dimensions, of which it forms the 'basic constitutional charter'.

[...]

24. All these cases have in common that, although the Court takes great care to respect the obligations that are incumbent on the Community by virtue of international law, it seeks, first and foremost, to preserve the constitutional framework created by the Treaty. Thus, it would be wrong to conclude that, once the Community is bound by a rule of international law, the Community Courts must bow to that rule with complete acquiescence and apply it unconditionally in the Community legal order. The relationship between international law and the Community legal order is governed by the Community legal order itself, and international law can permeate that legal order only under the conditions set by the constitutional principles of the Community.

[...]

43. I disagree with the respondents. They advocate a type of judicial review that at heart is very similar to the approach taken by the Court of First Instance under the heading of jus cogens. In a sense, their argument is yet another expression of the belief that the present case concerns a 'political question' and that the Court, unlike the political institutions, is not in a position to deal adequately with such questions. The reason would be that the matters at issue are of international significance and any intervention of the Court might upset globally-coordinated efforts to combat terrorism. The argument is also closely connected with the view that courts are ill equipped to determine which measures are appropriate to prevent international terrorism. The Security Council, in contrast, presumably has the expertise to make that determination. For these reasons, the respondents conclude that the Court should treat assessments made by the Security Council with the utmost deference and, if it does anything at all, should exercise a minimal review in respect of Community acts based on those assessments.

44. It is true that courts ought not to be institutionally blind. Thus, the Court should be mindful of the international context in which it operates and conscious of its limitations. It should be aware of the impact its rulings may have outside the confines of the Community. In an increasingly interdependent world, different legal orders will have to endeavour to accommodate each other's jurisdictional claims. As a result, the Court cannot always assert a monopoly on determining how certain fundamental interests ought to be reconciled. It must, where possible, recognise the authority of institutions, such as the Security Council, that are established under a different legal order than its own and that are sometimes better placed to weigh those fundamental interests. However, the Court cannot, in deference to the views of those institutions, turn its back on the fundamental values that lie at the basis of the Community legal order and which it has the duty to protect. Respect for other institutions is meaningful only if it can be built on a shared understanding of these values and on a mutual commitment to protect them. Consequently, in situations where the Community's fundamental values are in the balance, the Court may be required to reassess, and possibly annul, measures adopted by the Community institutions, even when those measures reflect the wishes of the Security Council.

45. The fact that the measures at issue are intended to suppress [[international terrorism]] should not inhibit the Court from fulfilling its duty to preserve the rule of law. In doing so, rather than trespassing into the domain of politics, the Court is reaffirming the limits that the law imposes on certain political decisions. This is never an easy task, and, indeed, it is a great challenge for a court to apply wisdom in matters relating to the threat of terrorism. Yet, the same holds true for the political institutions. Especially in matters of public security, the political process is liable to become overly responsive to immediate popular concerns, leading the authorities to allay the anxieties of the many at the expense of the rights of a few. This is precisely when courts ought to get involved, in order to ensure that the political necessities of today do not become the legal realities of tomorrow. Their responsibility is to guarantee that what may be politically expedient at a particular moment also complies with the rule of law without which, in the long run, no democratic society can truly prosper. In the words of [[Aharon Barak]], the former President on the [[Supreme Court of Israel]]:

‘It is when the cannons roar that we especially need the laws … Every struggle of the state – against terrorism or any other enemy – is conducted according to rules and law. There is always law which the state must comply with. There are no "black holes". … The reason at the foundation of this approach is not only the pragmatic consequence of the political and normative reality. Its roots lie much deeper. It is an expression of the difference between a democratic state fighting for its life and the fighting of terrorists rising up against it. The state fights in the name of the law and in the name of upholding the law. The terrorists fight against the law, while violating it. The war against terrorism is also law's war against those who rise up against it.'&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court of Israel, HCJ 769/02 [2006] The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel et. al. v. The Government of Israel et. al., paragraphs 61 and 62 (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

46. There is no reason, therefore, for the Court to depart, in the present case, from its usual interpretation of the fundamental rights that have been invoked by the appellant. The only novel question is whether the concrete needs raised by the prevention of international terrorism justify restrictions on the fundamental rights of the appellant that would otherwise not be acceptable. This does not entail a different conception of those fundamental rights and the applicable standard of review. It simply means that the weight to be given to the different interests which are always to be balanced in the application of the fundamental rights at issue may be different as a consequence of the specific needs arising from the prevention of international terrorism. But this is to be assessed in a normal exercise of judicial review by this Court. The present circumstances may result in a different balance being struck among the values involved in the protection of fundamental rights but the standard of protection afforded by them ought not to change.}}

===General Court===
The General Court held that the Regulation was valid. Although agreements with a non-member state ordinarily prevails, it cannot prevail over provisions forming a core part of the constitutional foundations of the EU system. 
233–259, Security Council resolution was binding on all UN members (UN Charter art 25) and prevailed over all treaties (art 103). It had to be carried out even if it conflicted with the EU Treaties. 
EU MSs were parties to the UN Charter before the EU Treaties, so TFEU art 351(1) required fulfilment of those obligations. This meant the Resolution prevailed over EU law. The EU was not bound under international law, but it was bound in EU law, following from International Fruit Company (1972) Case 21-4/72, [1972] ECHR 1219. 
There was, also, no infringement of a jus cogens norm by the Resolution.

===Court of Justice===
The Court of Justice held the resolution was invalid in EU law. The court had no jurisdiction to review the legality of Security Council Resolutions, but it could review EU regulations. The regulation was adopted to give effect to Member State obligations. Although under international law Security Council Resolutions prevail, under EU law the hierarchy of norms differs. It rejected that TFEU art 351 protected the Regulation from challenge. The Regulation was annulled in relation to Kadi, but effect maintained for a limited period.

{{Cquote|281. In this connection it is to be borne in mind that the Community is based on the rule of law, inasmuch as neither its Member States nor its institutions can avoid review of the conformity of their acts with the basic constitutional charter, the EC Treaty, which established a complete system of legal remedies and procedures designed to enable the Court of Justice to review the legality of acts of the institutions (Case 294/83 ''[[Les Verts v Parliament]]'' [1986] ECR 1339, paragraph 23).

282. At 'the very foundations of the Community' are certain norms.

285. It follows from all those considerations that the obligations imposed by an international agreement cannot have the effect of prejudicing the constitutional principles of the EC Treaty, which include the principle that all Community acts must respect fundamental rights, that respect constituting a condition of their lawfulness which it is for the Court to review in the framework of the complete system of legal remedies established by the Treaty.

300. A treaty can never enjoy primacy over provisions (including protection of fundamental human rights) that form part of the constitutional foundations of the union.

303. 'the principles enshrined... as a foundation of the Union’

304. 'the principles that form part of the very community legal order’

305-9. Even if the UN Charter were binding on the EU, it would not take primacy over the constitutive treaties, or the constitutional foundations of the EU system.}}

'''Karl Sack''' (born 9 June 1896 in Bosenheim (now [[Bad Kreuznach]]), executed 9 April 1945 in [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[jurist]] and member of the [[Widerstand|resistance movement]] during [[World War II]].
[[Image:Flossenbürg April 9 1945 Memorial.JPG|thumb|right]]
==Life==
Karl Sack studied law in [[Heidelberg, Germany|Heidelberg]] where he joined a [[Burschenschaft]] ([[:de:Burschenschaft Vineta|Burschenschaft Vineta]]) and after a time in legal practice became a [[judge]] in [[Hesse]]. He married Wilhelmine Weber and had two sons. In 1934, Sack joined the newly established Reichskriegsgericht (Reich Military Court) where he quickly rose to a senior position. He was able to delay proceedings against Army Commander-in-Chief [[Werner von Fritsch]] who had been falsely accused of [[homosexuality]] by the [[Gestapo]] in an attempt to discredit him for his opposition to [[Hitler|Hitler's]] attempts to subjugate the German armed forces. In the autumn of 1942, Karl Sack became Judge Advocate General of the Army.

[[Image:Gedenktafel Karl Sack.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque to Karl Sack at the former [[Reichskriegsgericht]] in Berlin]]
During the Second World War, Sack maintained contacts within the resistance circles in the [[military]], including Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]], Major General [[Hans Oster]] and [[Hans von Dohnanyi]], as well as with others within the [[Abwehr]] (German military intelligence). He was part of the  attempt to assassinate Hitler on [[20 July plot]] and after that failed attempt he was arrested on 9 August 1944. In the very last days of the war, he was brought before an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[drumhead court-martial]] presided over by [[Otto Thorbeck]]. He was sentenced to death and [[Hanging|hanged]] 2 days later. Sack had been slated for the role of Justice Minister within a planned post-coup civilian government.

In 1984, Sack's role as a member of the resistance was remembered with a bronze plaque placed in the former Reichskriegsgericht in [[Berlin-Charlottenburg]]. There was some opposition to this honour as Sack favoured a far-reaching interpretation of what constituted [[desertion]], which must have led to more than a few death sentences.

In Bosenheim, a suburb of Bad Kreuznach, a street has been named in his honour.

'''''Kidd v. Pearson''''', 128 U.S. 1 (1888), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that a distinction between manufacturing and commerce meant that an [[Iowa]] law that prohibited the manufacture of alcohol (in this case for sale out-of-state) was constitutional as it did not conflict with the power of the [[US Congress]] to regulate [[interstate commerce]].

==Background==
In 1882, Iowa became a [[dry state]] with a passage of a state constitutional amendment. An Iowa state law supporting that prohibition made the manufacturing of liquor in Iowa illegal unless it was for mechanical, medicinal, culinary, and sacramental purposes.  Nonetheless, the [[Polk County, Iowa|Polk County]] Board of Supervisors granted J. S. Kidd a license to operate a distillery in 1884 for other uses based on his intent to only sell the liquor outside the state of Iowa. When the state moved to close the distillery as a [[public nuisance]], Kidd sued and argued it was outside of state jurisdiction as an exclusively interstate business under the [[commerce clause]].

==Question before the Supreme Court==
Is there a conflict between the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.

==Decision of the Court==
The court ruled that there was not a conflict between Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce and the state law covering manufacturing within a given state. Therefore, the law was valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Kidd v. Pearson|volume=128|page=1|pin=|year=1888}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8936">{{Main|Feudal land tenure}}
'''Knight-service''' was a form of [[feudal land tenure]] under which a [[knight]] held a [[fief]] or estate of land termed a [[knight's fee]] (''fee'' being synonymous with ''fief'') from an overlord conditional on him as tenant performing military service for his overlord.

==History==
It is associated in its origin with that development in warfare which made the mailed horseman, armed with [[lance]] and [[sword]], the most important factor in battle. It was long believed that knight-service was developed out of the liability, under the  English system, of every five [[Hide (unit)|hides]] of land to provide one soldier in war. It is now held that, on the contrary, it was a novel system in England when it was introduced after [[Norman Conquest|the Conquest by the Normans]], who relied essentially on their mounted knights, while the English fought on foot. It existed in Normandy where a knight held a fief termed a ''fief du haubert'',  from the [[hauberk]] or coat of mail (Latin: ''lorica'')  worn by knights. Allusion is made to this in the coronation charter of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] (1100), which speaks of those holding by knight-service as "milites qui per loricam terras sues deserviunt."&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Knight-Service |volume=15 |pages=867–868 |inline=1 |first=John Horace |last=Round}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William the Conqueror|The Conqueror]] divided the lay lands of England among his magnates&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; in the form of "honours" or great blocks of land. These were subdivided by the magnates into smaller manors and yet smaller divisions or  [[fiefs]] just large enough to support one knight, termed [[knight's fee]]s. The knight paid [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to his overlord by taking a vow of loyalty and accepting the obligation to perform military service for his overlord.

The same system was adopted in [[Ireland]] when that country was conquered under [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]. The magnate who had been enfeoffed by his sovereign for his honour of land could provide the knights required either by hiring them for pay or, more conveniently when wealth was mainly represented by land, by a process of [[subinfeudation]], analogous to that by which he himself had been enfeoffed. That is to say, he could assign to an under-tenant a certain portion of his fief to be held by direct military service or the service of providing a [[mercenary]] knight. The land so held would then be described as consisting of one or more [[knight's fee]]s, but the knight's-fee had not any fixed area, as different soils and climates required differing acreages to produce a given profit requisite to support a knight and his entourage. This process could be carried farther till there was a chain of [[mesne lord]]s between the [[tenant-in-chief]] and the actual occupier of the land. The liability for performance of the knight-service was however always carefully defined.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The chief sources of information for the extent and development of knight-service are the returns (''cartae'') of the barons (i.e. the tenants-in-chief) in 1166, informing the king, at his request, of the names of their tenants by knight-service with the number of fees they held, supplemented by the payments for [[scutage]] recorded on the [[pipe rolls]], by the later returns printed in the ''[[Book of Fees]]'', and by the still later ones collected in Feudal Aids.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the returns made in 1166 some of the barons appear as having enfeoffed more and some less than the number of knights they had to find. In the latter case they described the balance as being chargeable on their ''demesne'', that is, on the portion of their fief which remained in their own hands. These returns further prove that lands had already been granted for the service of a fraction of a knight, such service being in practice already commuted for a proportionate money payment; and they show that the total number of knights with which land held by military service was charged was not, as was formerly supposed, sixty thousand, but, probably, somewhere between five and six thousand. Similar returns were made for Normandy, and are valuable for the light they throw on its system of knight-service.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Incidents of military tenure ==

The primary obligation incumbent on every knight was service in the field, when called upon, for forty days a year, with specified armour and arms. There was, however, a standing dispute as to whether he could be called upon to perform this service outside the realm, nor was the question of his expenses free from difficulty. In addition to this primary duty he had, in numerous cases at least, to perform that of castle ward at his lords chief castle for a fixed number of days in the year. On certain baronies also was incumbent the duty of providing knights for the guard of royal castles, such as Windsor, Rockingham and Dover.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Under the feudal system the tenant by knight-service had also the same pecuniary obligations to his lord as had his lord to the king. These consisted of:&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone (1753), ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', Book 2, Chapter V "Of the Ancient English Tenures"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aids, which consisted of the duty to ransom the lord if he were taken prison, to make the lord's eldest son a knight, and to marry the lord's eldest daughter
* Relief, which he paid on succeeding to his lands;
* [[Seisin#Primer seisin|Primer seisin]]
* Wardship, that is, the profits from his lands during a minority &lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;(''i.e.'', if the landholder is too young to manage the land);
* Marriage, that is, the right of giving in marriage (unless bought off), his heiress, his heir (if a minor) and his widow&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Denaturation==
The principle of commuting for money the obligation of military service struck at the root of the whole system, and so complete was the change of conception that tenure by knightservice of a mesne lord becomes, first in fact and then in law, tenure by ''escuage'' (i.e. [[scutage]]). By the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], as [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]] states, the test of tenure was scutage; liability, however small, to scutage payment made the tenure military.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The disintegration of the system was carried further in the latter half of the 13th century as a consequence of changes in warfare, which were increasing the importance of foot soldiers and making the service of a knight for forty days of less value to the king. The barons, instead of paying scutage, compounded for their service by the payment of lump sums, and, by a process which is still obscure, the nominal quotas of knight-service due from each had, by the time of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], been largely reduced. The knight's fee, however, remained a knight's fee, and the pecuniary incidents of military tenure, especially wardship, marriage, and fines on alienation, long continued to be a source of revenue to the crown. But at the Restoration (1660) tenure by knight-service was abolished by the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]], and with it these vexatious exactions were abolished.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Sources and bibliography==
The returns of 1166 are preserved in the ''Liber Niger'' (13th century), edited by [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Hearne]], and the ''Liber Rubeus'' or ''[[Red Book of the Exchequer]]'' (13th century), edited by H. Hall for the [[Rolls Series]] in 1896. The later returns are in the ''[[Book of Fees]]'' and in the Record Office volumes of ''Feudal Aids'', arranged under counties.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

For the financial side of knight-service the early pipe rolls have been printed by the Record Commission and the [[Pipe Roll Society]], and abstracts of later ones will be found in ''The Red Book of the Exchequer'', which may be studied on the whole question; but the editors view must be received with caution and checked by JH Round's ''Studies on the Red Book of the Exchequer'' (for private circulation). The ''Baronia Anglica'' of [[Thomas Madox|Madox]] may also be consulted.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The existing theory on knight-service was enunciated by Mr Round in ''English Historical Review'', vi., vii, and reissued by him in his ''Feudal England'' (1895). It is accepted by Pollock and Maitland (''History of English Law''), who discuss the question at length; by Mr JF Baldwin in his ''Scutage and Knight-service in England'' (University of Chicago Press, 1897), a valuable monograph with bibliography; and by Petit-Dutaillis, in his ''Studies supplementary to Stubbs' Constitutional History'' (Manchester University Series, 1908).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Legal aid in civil and other non-criminal cases==
Legal aid can be provided in civil (which includes family law), administrative, labour, social welfare and even constitutional disputes before courts if a party is not in a position to pay court and counsel fees.&lt;ref&gt;See sec. 114 of the German civil procedure code (ZPO)&lt;/ref&gt; Legal aid is provided by exemption from court costs and payment of counsel fees from the state budget upon decision by the court. The amount provided in legal aid cases paid to the lawyer is regulated in a statutory fee schedule but considerably lower than counsel could normally claim pursuant to the regular fee table from a client who is not entitled to legal aid.

The granting of legal aid by the court requires that the applicant proves that the claimant is (a) economically not able to bear the costs of the procedures, and (b) that his lawsuit has reasonable prospects of success, and (c) that the cause of action is not frivolous.&lt;ref&gt;Sec. 114 para. 1 ZPO&lt;/ref&gt; The application for legal aid is typically lodged together with the draft of the complaint with the bench of the competent court. This has the advantage for the legal aid applicant that he is provisionally relieved of the payment of the court costs while the bench not only reviews his economic status but also determines the merits of the case, i.e. as to whether the lawsuit appears to have reasonable prospect of success, based merely on the facts and arguments as presented in the draft complaint. Thus, a summary review of the cause of action is carried out by the court. Only if all conditions are met and legal aid thus granted will the court communicate the complaint to the other party and the judicial dispute thereby commences with the costs borne by the court. However, the legal aid seeking litigant can also lodge effectively the complaint together with auxiliary legal aid request but without making the pendency of the case dependent on the court granting legal aid; or the litigant requests legal aid support at a later stage but before completion of case procedures.  In the latter scenarios, if legal aid is rejected by the court the litigant, who sought legal aid, will bear the counsel and court fees if he loses the lawsuit (or bears the costs partially if he loses partially). Defence cases are treated equivalently.

The German judicare system leads to the review of legal aid cases on indigence and their merits first by the lawyers in private practice, then the courts, while averting dependence on external legal aid institutions removed from the judicial process. Another element of strength lies in the system’s low cost.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, The German Alternative, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether smaller amounts of state budgets are provided for legal aid per capita compared with other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Barendrecht, Legal Aid in Europe, p. 49-54&lt;/ref&gt; To secure receiving their fees through legal aid, lawyers’ drafted briefs must have arguable merit thereby ensuring the high quality of representation of indigents.  Substandard performance of lawyers is therefore not an option. The German model is also considered to put the indigent litigant on genuine equality with a wealthy litigant.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, The German Alternative, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; The indigent has the same right to choose her lawyer as a more affluent person. The lawyer representing the indigent is naturally motivated to win the case since as a victorious party he is entitled to recover the full lawyer’s fees, i.e. not just the reduced legal aid fees, from the party that loses the case.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Schlesinger, The German Alternative, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; The loser-pays-all system constitutes an incentive for lawyers to represent indigent clients.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Legal aid in criminal procedures==
In criminal procedures, the court assigns an accused with a defence counsel in so-called “necessary defence”&lt;ref&gt;See section 140 (1) of the German Code of Criminal Procedure&lt;/ref&gt; cases if the accused has not already retained himself a lawyer. In practice, however, usually the court appoints the lawyer which the accused had already chosen for his mandatory representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=D. Brodowski |author2=C. Burchard |author3=N. Kotzurek |author4=J. Rauber |author5=J. Vogel | publisher =Intersentia | year =2010 | title =Effective Criminal Defence in Europe, Chapter 7 Germany | page =10 | url =http://www.legalaidreform.org/criminal-legal-aid-resources/item/download/151_16db0785fd3c2f9e7c6e7bff1f1820de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Necessary defence means that the accused is charged with a felony that is punishable by a minimum sentence of one year’s imprisonment, is tried before a higher court, already is detained on remand or otherwise not considered able to defend himself.&lt;ref&gt;Section 140 (1) CCP&lt;/ref&gt; The entitlement of an accused to have counsel assigned to him in cases of mandatory legal representation is irrespective of indigence.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Brodowski et al., Effective Criminal Defence in Europe, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The court-assigned defence lawyer is entitled to claim his fees from the state budget. Like in civil proceedings, however, the legal aid fees are lower than fees the lawyer could otherwise claim from the client.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Every lawyer can be appointed by the court as a public defender scheme does not exist in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Brodowski et al., Effective Criminal Defence in Europe, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; If the accused loses the case, i.e. he becomes a convict, the court imposes the court fees and the costs of defence on the defendant. After conviction, the court-appointed lawyer can choose whether to execute his claim against his convicted client or against the treasury. Normally, if his client is indigent, the lawyer will seek payment from the solvent debtor, the state.&lt;ref&gt;Brodowski et al., Effective Criminal Defence in Europe, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; If a case does not require “necessary defence”, an accused, who cannot pay a lawyer, is not entitled to be provided with counsel paid by the state but must defend himself.

The '''Library of Congress''' ('''LOC''') is the research library that officially serves the [[United States Congress]] and is the ''[[de facto]]'' national library of the United States. It is the oldest federal cultural institution in the United States. The Library is housed in three buildings on [[Capitol Hill]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; it also maintains the [[National Audio-Visual Conservation Center]] in [[Culpeper, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Fascinating Facts" /&gt; The Library's functions are overseen by the [[Librarian of Congress]], and its buildings are maintained by the [[Architect of the Capitol]].  The Library of Congress has claims to be the [[List of largest libraries|largest library in the world]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica: Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|title=Library of Congress|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Library-of-Congress|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FFStats&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating Facts - Statistics|url=https://www.loc.gov/about/fascinating-facts/|website=The Library of Congress|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its "collections are universal, not limited by subject, format, or national boundary, and include research materials from all parts of the world and in more than 450 languages."&lt;ref name="Fascinating Facts" /&gt;

The Library of Congress moved to Washington in 1800 after sitting for 11 years in the temporary national capitals in [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]]. The small Congressional Library was housed in the [[United States Capitol]] for most of the 19th century until the early 1890s. Most of the original collection had been destroyed by the British in 1814 during the [[War of 1812]], and the library sought to restore its collection in 1815. They bought [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s entire personal collection of 6,487 books.  After a period of slow growth, another fire struck the Library in its Capitol chambers in 1851, again destroying a large amount of the collection, including many of Jefferson's books.  After the [[American Civil War]], the Library of Congress grew rapidly in both size and importance, which sparked a campaign to purchase replacement copies for volumes that had been burned. The Library received the right of transference of all copyrighted works to deposit two copies of books, maps, illustrations, and diagrams printed in the United States. It also began to build its collections, and its development culminated between 1888 and 1894 with the construction of a separate, extensive library building across the street from the Capitol.

The Library's primary mission is to research inquiries made by members of Congress, carried out through the [[Congressional Research Service]]. The Library is open to the public, although only high-ranking government officials and Library employees may check out books and materials.

===1800–1851: Origin and Jefferson's contribution===

[[James Madison]] is credited with the idea of creating a congressional library, first making such a proposition in 1783.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Murray, Stuart. The Library: An Illustrated History (New York, Skyhouse Publishing, 2012): 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The Library of Congress was subsequently established April 24, 1800 when President [[John Adams]] signed an act of Congress providing for the transfer of the seat of government from [[Philadelphia]] to the new capital city of Washington. Part of the legislation appropriated $5,000 "for the purchase of such books as may be necessary for the use of Congress ... and for fitting up a suitable apartment for containing them."&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|2|55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books were ordered from London, and the collection consisted of 740 books and 3 maps which were housed in the new [[United States Capitol]].&lt;ref name="loc history"&gt;{{cite web| title=Jefferson's Legacy • A Brief History of the Library of Congress| publisher=Library of Congress| url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/legacy/loc.html| date=March 6, 2006| accessdate=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Thomas Jefferson]] played an important role in establishing the structure of the Library of Congress. On January 26, 1802, he signed a bill that allowed the president to appoint the [[Librarian of Congress]] and establishing a [[Joint Committee on the Library]] to regulate and oversee it.  The new law also extended borrowing privileges to the President and Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|2|128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=Murray|first=Stuart P.|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub]]|year=2009|isbn=9781602397064|location=New York, NY|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invading British army [[Burning of Washington|burned Washington]] in August 1814 during the [[War of 1812]] and destroyed the Library of Congress and its collection of 3,000 volumes.&lt;ref name="loc history"/&gt; These volumes had been left in the Senate wing of the Capitol.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One of the few congressional volumes to survive was a government account book of receipts and expenditures for 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library An Illustrated History

Within a month, Thomas Jefferson offered to sell his personal library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.librarything.com/catalog.php?view=ThomasJefferson |title=Thomas Jefferson's personal library, at LibraryThing, based on scholarship |publisher=LibraryThing |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.librarything.com/profile/ThomasJefferson LibraryThing profile page for Thomas Jefferson's library], summarizing contents and indicating sources&lt;/ref&gt; as a replacement. Congress accepted his offer in January 1815, appropriating $23,950 to purchase his 6,487 books.&lt;ref name="loc history"/&gt; Some members of the House of Representatives opposed the outright purchase, including New Hampshire Representative [[Daniel Webster]] who wanted to return "all books of an atheistical, irreligious, and immoral tendency."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=Murray|first=Stuart P.|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub]]|year=2009|isbn=9781602397064|location=Chicago|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson had spent 50 years accumulating a wide variety of books in several languages and on subjects such as philosophy, history, law, religion, architecture, travel, natural sciences, mathematics, studies of classical Greece and Rome, modern inventions, hot air balloons, music, submarines, fossils, agriculture, and meteorology.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He had also collected books on topics not normally viewed as part of a legislative library, such as cookbooks. However, he believed that all subjects had a place in the Library of Congress. He remarked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not know that it contains any branch of science which Congress would wish to exclude from their collection; there is, in fact, no subject to which a Member of Congress may not have occasion to refer.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jefferson's collection was unique in that it was the working collection of a scholar, not a gentleman's collection for display. His original collection was organized into a scheme based on [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[Works by Francis Bacon#Scientific works|organization of knowledge]]. Specifically, he grouped his books into Memory, Reason, and Imagination, which broke down into 44 more subdivisions. The Library followed Jefferson's organization scheme until the late 19th century, when librarian [[Herbert Putnam]] began work on a more flexible Library of Congress Classification structure that now applies to more than 138 million items.

In 1851, a fire destroyed two thirds of the Jefferson collection, with only 2,000 books remaining. By 2008, the Librarians of Congress had found replacements for all but 300 of the works that were in Jefferson's original collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Thomas Jefferson's Library| url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0806/jefferson.html| last=Fineberg| first=Gail| work=The Gazette| publisher=Library of Congress| date=June 2007| volume=67| number=6| accessdate=2015-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1851–1865: Weakening===

On December 22, 1851 the largest fire in the Library's history destroyed 35,000 books, about two–thirds of the Library's collection and two-thirds of Jefferson's original transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=History, Art &amp; Archives, U.S. House of Representatives|title=An 1851 Library of Congress Fire|url=http://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1800-1850/An-1825-Library-of-Congress-fire/|website=United States House of Representatives|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress appropriated $168,700 to replace the lost books in 1852 but not to acquire new materials.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=J.Y.|title=Jefferson's Legacy: a brief history of the Library of Congress|date=1993|publisher=Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This marked the start of a conservative period in the Library's administration by librarian [[John Silva Meehan]] and joint committee chairman [[James A. Pearce]], who restricted the Library's activities.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"/&gt; Meehan and Pearce's views about a restricted scope for the Library of Congress reflected those shared by members of Congress. While Meehan was Librarian he supported and perpetuated the notion that "the congressional library should play a limited role on the national scene and that its collections, by and large, should emphasize American materials of obvious use to the U.S. Congress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=J.Y.|title=The Library of Congress Becomes a World Leader, 1815-2005|journal=Libraries &amp; Culture|date=2005|volume=40|issue=3|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, Congress transferred the Library's public document distribution activities to the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] and its international book exchange program to the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Interior Library|title=History of the Interior Library|url=https://www.doi.gov/library/about/history|website=U.S. Department for the Interior|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1850s, [[Smithsonian Institution]] librarian [[Charles Coffin Jewett]] aggressively tried to make the Smithsonian into the United States' national library. His efforts were blocked by Smithsonian secretary [[Joseph Henry]], who advocated a focus on scientific research and publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smithsonian Institution|title=An Account Of The Smithsonian: Its Origin, History, Objects and Achievements|date=1904|location=Washington, D.C.|page=12|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reinforce his intentions for the Smithsonian, Henry established laboratories, developed a robust physical sciences library and started the ''[[Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge]]'', the first of many publications intended to disseminate research results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mearns|first1=D.C.|title=The Story Up To Now: The Library of Congress, 1800-1946|date=1946|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=100|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Henry, the Library of Congress was the obvious choice as the national library. Unable to resolve the conflict, Henry dismissed Jewett in July 1854. In 1865 the Smithsonian building, also called the Castle due to its Norman architectural style, was devastated by fire and presented Henry an opportunity in regards to the Smithsonian's non-scientific library. Around this time, the Library of Congress was making plans to build and relocate to the new [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], which would be fire proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|title=Annual Report of the Librarian of Congress 1866|url=https://www.copyright.gov/reports/annual/archive/ar-1866.pdf|website=U.S. Copyright Office|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorized by an act of Congress, he transferred the Smithsonian's non-scientific library of 40,000 volumes to the Library of Congress in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gwinn|first1=Nancy|title=History|url=https://library.si.edu/about/history|website=Smithsonian Libraries|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed [[John G. Stephenson]] as Librarian of Congress in 1861 and the appointment is regarded as the most political to date.&lt;ref name="John G Stephenson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|title=John G Stephenson|url=https://www.loc.gov/about/about-the-librarian/previous-librarians-of-congress/john-g-stephenson/|website=John G Stephenson - Previous Librarians of Congress|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson was a physician and spent equal time serving as Librarian and as a physician in the Union Army. He could manage this division of interest because he hired [[Ainsworth Rand Spofford]] as his assistant.&lt;ref name="John G Stephenson"/&gt; Despite his new job, Stephenson's focus was on non-library affairs; three weeks into his term, he left Washington, D.C. to serve as a volunteer aide-de-camp at the battles of [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="John G Stephenson"/&gt; Stephenson's term as Librarian seems to have left little imprint on the Library although hiring Spofford, who was left to run the Library in his absence, may have been his most significant achievement.&lt;ref name="John G Stephenson"/&gt;

===1865–1897: Spofford's expansion===

The Library of Congress reasserted itself during the latter half of the 19th century under Librarian [[Ainsworth Rand Spofford]] who directed it from 1865 to 1897. He built broad bipartisan support for it as a national library and a legislative resource, aided by an overall expansion of the federal government and a favorable political climate. He began comprehensively collecting [[Americana]] and [[American literature]], led the construction of a new building to house the Library, and transformed the Librarian of Congress position into one of strength and independence.  Between 1865 and 1870, Congress appropriated funds for the construction of the [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], placed all copyright registration and deposit activities under the Library's control, and restored the international book exchange. The Library also acquired the vast libraries of the Smithsonian and of historian [[Peter Force]], strengthening its scientific and Americana collections significantly. By 1876, the Library of Congress had 300,000 volumes and was tied with the [[Boston Public Library]] as the nation's largest library. It moved from the Capitol building to its new headquarters in 1897 with more than 840,000 volumes, 40 percent of which had been acquired through copyright deposit.&lt;ref name="loc history"/&gt;
[[File:Hl026001.jpg|thumb|right|alt=piles of books waiting to be shelved in Thomas Jefferson building|Some of the Library of Congress' holdings awaiting shelving inside the newly opened Thomas Jefferson Building in 1897]]

A year before the Library's move to its new location, the Joint Library Committee held a session of hearings to assess the condition of the Library and plan for its future growth and possible reorganization. Spofford and six experts sent by the [[American Library Association]]&lt;ref&gt;These included future Librarian of Congress [[Herbert Putnam]] and [[Melvil Dewey]] of the [[New York State Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; testified that the Library should continue its expansion towards becoming a true national library. Congress more than doubled the Library's staff from 42 to 108 based on the hearings, and with the assistance of Senators [[Justin Morrill]] of Vermont and [[Daniel W. Voorhees]] of Indiana, and established new administrative units for all aspects of the collection. Congress also strengthened the office of Librarian of Congress to govern the Library and make staff appointments, as well as requiring Senate approval for presidential appointees to the position.&lt;ref name="loc history"/&gt;

===1897–1939: Post-reorganization===

The Library of Congress, spurred by the 1897 reorganization, began to grow and develop more rapidly. Spofford's successor [[John Russell Young]], though only in office for two years, overhauled the Library's bureaucracy, used his connections as a former diplomat to acquire more materials from around the world, and established the Library's first assistance programs for the [[Blindness|blind]] and physically disabled.  Young's successor [[Herbert Putnam]] held the office for forty years from 1899 to 1939, entering into the position two years before the Library became the first in the United States to hold one million volumes.&lt;ref name="loc history"/&gt; Putnam focused his efforts on making the Library more accessible and useful for the public and for other libraries. He instituted the interlibrary loan service, transforming the Library of Congress into what he referred to as a "library of last resort".&lt;ref name="interlibrary loan"&gt;{{cite web| title=Interlibrary Loan (Collections Access, Management and Loan Division, Library of Congress)| url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/loan/| date=October 25, 2007| publisher=Library of Congress website| accessdate =December 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam also expanded Library access to "scientific investigators and duly qualified individuals" and began publishing [[primary sources]] for the benefit of scholars.&lt;ref name="loc history"/&gt;

Putnam's tenure also saw increasing diversity in the Library's acquisitions. In 1903, he persuaded President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to transfer by executive order the papers of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] from the State Department to the Library of Congress. Putnam expanded foreign acquisitions as well, including the 1904 purchase of a four-thousand volume library of [[Indica (Megasthenes)|Indica]], the 1906 purchase of G. V. Yudin's eighty-thousand volume Russian library, the 1908 Schatz collection of early opera [[librettos]], and the early 1930s purchase of the Russian Imperial Collection, consisting of 2,600 volumes from the library of the [[Romanov family]] on a variety of topics. Collections of [[Hebraica]] and Chinese and Japanese works were also acquired.  Congress even took the initiative to acquire materials for the Library in one occasion, when in 1929 Congressman [[Ross Collins]] of Mississippi successfully proposed the $1.5 million purchase of Otto Vollbehr's collection of [[incunabula]], including one of three remaining perfect vellum copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Snapp |first=Elizabeth |title=The Acquisition of the Vollbehr Collection of Incunabula for the Library of Congress |journal=The Journal of Library History (1974-1987) |volume=10 |issue=2 |date=April 1975 |pages=152–161 |publisher=University of Texas Press |jstor=25540624 }} (restricted access)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loc history"/&gt;
[[File:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumb|alt=Gutenberg bible open to page|A copy of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] on display at the Library of Congress]]
In 1914, Putnam established the [[Legislative Reference Service]] as a separative administrative unit of the Library. Based in the [[Progressive era]]'s philosophy of science as a problem-solver, and modeled after successful research branches of state legislatures, the LRS would provide informed answers to Congressional research inquiries on almost any topic.  In 1965, Congress passed an act allowing the Library of Congress to establish a trust fund board to accept donations and endowments, giving the Library a role as a patron of the arts. The Library received the donations and endowments of prominent individuals such as [[John D. Rockefeller]], James B. Wilbur and [[Archer M. Huntington]]. Gertrude Clarke Whittall donated five [[List of Stradivarius instruments#Violins|Stradivarius violins]] to the Library and [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]]'s donations paid for a [[concert hall]] within the Library of Congress building and the establishment of an [[honorarium]] for the Music Division. A number of chairs and consultantships were established from the donations, the most well-known of which is the [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|Poet Laureate Consultant]].&lt;ref name="loc history"/&gt;

The Library's expansion eventually filled the Library's Main Building, despite shelving expansions in 1910 and 1927, forcing the Library to expand into a new structure. Congress acquired nearby land in 1928 and approved construction of the Annex Building (later the John Adams Building) in 1930. Although delayed during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] years, it was completed in 1938 and opened to the public in 1939.&lt;ref name="loc history"/&gt;

When Putnam retired in 1939, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appointed [[Archibald MacLeish]] as his successor. Occupying the post from 1939 to 1944 during the height of World War II, MacLeish became the most visible Librarian of Congress in the Library's history. MacLeish encouraged librarians to oppose [[totalitarianism]] on behalf of democracy; dedicated the South Reading Room of the Adams Building to Thomas Jefferson, commissioning artist [[Ezra Winter]] to paint four themed murals for the room; and established a "democracy alcove" in the Main Reading Room of the Jefferson Building for important documents such as the Declaration, Constitution and ''[[The Federalist Papers]]''. The Library of Congress even assisted during the war effort, ranging from the storage of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution]] in [[Fort Knox]] for safekeeping to researching weather data on the [[Himalayas]] for [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] pilots.  MacLeish resigned in 1944 to become Assistant Secretary of State, and President [[Harry Truman]] appointed [[Luther H. Evans]] as Librarian of Congress. Evans, who served until 1953, expanded the Library's acquisitions, cataloging and bibliographic services as much as the fiscal-minded Congress would allow, but his primary achievement was the creation of Library of Congress Missions around the world. Missions played a variety of roles in the postwar world: the mission in San Francisco assisted participants in the [[meeting that established the United Nations]], the mission in Europe acquired European publications for the Library of Congress and other American libraries, and the mission in Japan aided in the creation of the [[National Diet Library]].&lt;ref name="loc history"/&gt; 
Evans' successor [[L. Quincy Mumford]] took over in 1953. Mumford's tenure, lasting until 1974, saw the initiation of the construction of the James Madison Memorial Building, the third Library of Congress building. Mumford directed the Library during a period of increased educational spending, the windfall of which allowed the Library to devote energies towards establishing new acquisition centers abroad, including in [[Cairo]] and New Delhi. In 1967, the Library began experimenting with [[book preservation]] techniques through a Preservation Office, which grew to become the largest library research and conservation effort in the United States.  Mumford's administration also saw the last major public debate about the Library of Congress' role as both a legislative library and a national library. A 1962 memorandum by Douglas Bryant of the [[Harvard University Library]], compiled at the request of Joint Library Committee chairman [[Claiborne Pell]], proposed a number of institutional reforms, including expansion of national activities and services and various organizational changes, all of which would shift the Library more towards its national role over its legislative role. Bryant even suggested possibly changing the name of the Library of Congress, which was rebuked by Mumford as "unspeakable violence to tradition".  Debate continued within the library community until the [[Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970]] shifted the Library back towards its legislative roles, placing greater focus on research for Congress and congressional committees and renaming the Legislative Reference Service to the [[Congressional Research Service]].&lt;ref name="loc history"/&gt;

After Mumford retired in 1974, Gerald Ford appointed [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] as Librarian. Boorstin's first challenge was the move to the new Madison Building, which took place between 1980 and 1982. The move released pressures on staff and shelf space, allowing Boorstin to focus on other areas of Library administration such as acquisitions and collections. Taking advantage of steady budgetary growth, from $116 million in 1975 to over $250 million by 1987, Boorstin actively participated in enhancing ties with scholars, authors, publishers, cultural leaders, and the business community. His active and prolific role changed the post of Librarian of Congress so that by the time he retired in 1987, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "perhaps the leading intellectual public position in the nation".

President Ronald Reagan nominated [[James H. Billington]] as the 13th Librarian of Congress in 1987, and the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed the appointment.&lt;ref name="loc.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Key Milestones of James H. Billington's Tenure {{!}} News Releases - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2015/15-105.html|website = Loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Billington's leadership, the Library doubled the size of its analog collections from 85.5 million items in 1987 to more than 160 million items in 2014. At the same time, it established new programs and employed new technologies to, "get the champagne out of the bottle." These included:
* '''American Memory''' created in 1990, which became '''The National Digital Library''' in 1994, providing free access online to digitized American history and culture resources with curatorial explanations for [[K-12 education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = American Memory from the Library of Congress - Home Page|url = http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/index.html|website =Memory.loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''thomas.gov website''' launched in 1994 to provide free public access to U.S. federal legislative information with ongoing updates; and '''congress.gov website''' to provide a state-of-the-art framework for both Congress and the public in 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Congress.gov {{!}} Library of Congress|url = https://www.congress.gov/|website = www.congress.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The Kluge Center''', started with a grant of $60 million from John W. Kluge in 2000 to bring scholars and researchers from around the world to use Library resources and to interact with policymakers and the public. It hosts public lectures and scholarly events, provides endowed Kluge fellowships, and awards '''The Kluge Prize for the Study of Humanity''' (now worth $1.5 million), the first Nobel-level international prize for lifetime achievement in the humanities and social sciences (subjects not included in the Nobel awards);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The John W.

In 1988, The Library also established the National Film Preservation Board, a congressionally mandated National Film Preservation Board to select American films annually for preservation and inclusion in the new National Registry. The Librarian named 650 films to the Registry by 2015;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inside the Nuclear Bunker Where America Preserves Its Movie History|url = https://www.wired.com/2015/07/film-preservation/|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Billington's tenure as the 13th Librarian of Congress, the Library acquired Lafayette's previously inaccessible papers in 1996 from a castle at La Grange, France; and the only copy of the 1507 [[Waldseemüller map|Waldseemüller]] world map ("America's birth certificate") in 2003 for permanent display in the Library's Thomas Jefferson Building. Using privately raised funds, the Library of Congress reconstructed Thomas Jefferson's original library, which was placed on permanent display in the Jefferson building in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Thomas Jefferson's Library {{!}} Exhibitions - Library of Congress|url = http://loc.gov/exhibits/thomas-jeffersons-library/|website = loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billington also enlarged and technologically enhanced public spaces of the Jefferson Building into a national exhibition venue, and hosted over 100 exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = All Exhibitions - Exhibitions (Library of Congress)|url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/all/|website =Loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included exhibits on the [[Vatican Library]] and the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale de France]], several on the Civil War and Lincoln, on African-American culture, on Religion and the founding of the American Republic, the Early Americas (the Kislak Collection became a permanent display), on the global celebration commemorating the 800th anniversary of [[Magna Carta]], and on early American printing featuring the Rubenstein [[Bay Psalm Book]]. Onsite access to the Library of Congress was also increased when Billington advocated successfully for an underground connection between the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center and the Library in 2008 to increase congressional usage and public tours of the Library's Thomas Jefferson Building.&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt;

Under Billington, the Library launched a [[mass deacidification]] program in 2001, which has extended the lifespan of almost 4 million volumes and 12 million manuscript sheets; and new collection storage modules at Fort Meade, the first opening in 2002, to preserve and make accessible more than 4 million items from the Library's analog collections. Billington established the Library Collections Security Oversight Committee in 1992 to improve protection of collections, and also the Library of Congress Congressional Caucus in 2008 to draw attention to the Library's curators and collections. He created the Library's first Young Readers Center in the Jefferson Building in 2009, and the first large-scale summer intern (Junior Fellows) program for university
students in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2015 Junior Fellows Summer Intern Program Home (Library of Congress)|url = https://www.loc.gov/hr/jrfellows/|website = Loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Billington, the Library also sponsored the Gateway to Knowledge in 2010-2011, a mobile exhibition to 90 sites covering all states east of the Mississippi in a specially designed 18-wheel truck, increasing public access to Library collections off-site, particularly for rural populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gateway to Knowledge - Educational Resources - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/gateway/resources.html|website = Loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billington raised more than half a billion dollars of private support to supplement Congressional appropriations for Library collections, programs, and digital outreach. These private funds helped the Library to continue its growth and outreach in the face of a 30% decrease in staffing caused mainly by legislative appropriations cutbacks. He created the Library's first development office for private fundraising in 1987, and, in 1990, established the James Madison Council, the Library's first national private sector donor-support group. In 1987, Billington also asked the GAO to conduct the first Library-wide audit, and he created the first Office of the Inspector General at the Library to provide regular independent review of library operations. This precedent led to regular annual financial audits, leading to unmodified ("clean") opinions from 1995 onwards.&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt;

In April 2010, it announced plans to archive all public communication on [[Twitter]], including all communication since Twitter's launch in March 2006.&lt;ref name=Grier&gt;{{cite news| first=Peter| last=Grier| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2010/0416/Twitter-hits-Library-of-Congress-Would-Founding-Fathers-tweet| title=Twitter hits Library of Congress: Would Founding Fathers tweet?| work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=16 April 2010 |accessdate=2015-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, the Twitter archive remains unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimmer|first1=Michael|title=The Twitter Archive at the Library of Congress: Challenges for information practice and information policy|url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/5619/4653|website=First Monday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before retiring in 2015, after 28 years of service, Billington had come "under pressure" as Librarian of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article41942157.html Librarian of Congress gets a Due Date]" by Maria Recio, McClatchy DC, Oct. 30. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This followed a [[Government Accountability Office]] report which revealed a "work environment lacking central oversight" and faulted Billington for "ignoring repeated calls to hire a chief information officer, as required by law."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/americas-national-library-is-behind-the-digital-curve-a-new-report-finds/2015/03/31/fad54c3a-d3fd-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html America's 'national library' is lacking in leadership, yet another report finds]" by Peggy McGlone, The Washington Post, March 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Billington announced his plans to retire in 2015, commentator George Weigel described the Library of Congress as "one of the last refuges in Washington of serious bipartisanship and calm, considered conversation," and "one of the world's greatest cultural centers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = America's Next 'Minister of Culture': Don't Politicize the Appointment|url = http://www.nationalreview.com/article/419664/americas-next-minister-culture-dont-politicize-appointment|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the library announced the Librarian-in-Residence program which aims to support the future generation of librarians by giving them opportunity to gain work experience in five different areas of librarianship including: Acquisitions/Collection Development, Cataloging/Metadata, and Collection Preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/librarians/librarians-in-residence/|title=Librarians-in-Residence -|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections of the Library of Congress include more than 32 million cataloged books and other print materials in 470 languages; more than 61 million [[manuscript]]s; the largest rare book collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/|title=Rare Book and Special Collections Reading Room (Library of Congress)|website=Loc.gov|accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in North America, including the rough draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], a [[Gutenberg Bible]] (originating from the [[St. Blaise Abbey, Black Forest]]) (one of only three perfect [[vellum]] copies known to exist);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.approvedarticles.com/Article/Gutenberg-s-Bibles--Where-to-Find-Them/1088 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706031919/http://www.approvedarticles.com/Article/Gutenberg-s-Bibles--Where-to-Find-Them/1088 |archivedate=July 6, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.octavo.com/editions/gtnbbl/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041127190224/http://www.octavo.com/editions/gtnbbl/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-11-27|title=Octavo Editions: Gutenberg Bible|work=octavo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/guide/europe.html|title=Europe (Library of Congress Rare Books and Special Collections: An Illustrated Guide)|website=Loc.gov|accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ANONS, PLEASE READ THE LINK COMPLETELY before changing it to '3': "A fourth and final perfect vellum copy of the Bible is in Goettigen, Germany's Universitaetsbibliothek." --&gt; over 1 million [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] publications; 1 million issues of world newspapers spanning the past three centuries; 33,000 bound newspaper volumes; 500,000 [[microfilm]] reels; over 6,000 titles in all, totaling more than 120,000 issues comic book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=April 7, 2006 |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/coll/049.html|title=Comic Book Collection |publisher=The Library of Congress |accessdate=August 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; titles; films; 5.3 million [[map]]s; 6 million works of [[sheet music]]; 3 million [[sound recording]]s; more than 14.7 million prints and photographic images including fine and popular art pieces and architectural drawings;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=Annual Report of the Librarian of Congress| publisher=Library of Congress| year=2009| url=https://www.loc.gov/about/reports/annualreports/fy2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Betts Stradivarius]]; and the [[List of Stradivarius instruments#Violas|Cassavetti Stradivarius]].

The Library developed a system of book classification called [[Library of Congress Classification]] (LCC), which is used by most US research and [[university library|university libraries]].

The Library serves as a legal repository for [[copyright]] protection and [[copyright registration]], and as the base for the [[United States Copyright Office]]. Regardless of whether they register their copyright, all publishers are required to submit two complete copies of their published works to the Library—this requirement is known as ''mandatory deposit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/mandatory_deposit.html| title=Mandatory Deposit| publisher=Copyright.gov| accessdate=August 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 15,000 new items published in the U.S. arrive every business day at the Library. Contrary to popular belief, however, the Library does not retain all of these works in its permanent collection, although it does add an average of 12,000 items per day.&lt;ref name="Fascinating Facts" /&gt; Rejected items are used in trades with other libraries around the world, distributed to federal agencies, or donated to schools, communities, and other organizations within the United States.&lt;ref name="Fascinating Facts" /&gt; As is true of many [[Legal deposit|similar libraries]], the Library of Congress retains copies of every publication in the English language that is deemed significant.

The Library of Congress states that its collection fills about {{convert|838|mi|km}} of bookshelves,&lt;ref name="FFStats" /&gt; while the [[British Library]] reports about {{convert|388|mi|km}} of shelves.&lt;ref name="aboutbrit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/index.html |title=Facts and figures |publisher=British Library |accessdate=June 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nMvdOGz0?url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/index.html |archivedate=February 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library of Congress holds more than 167 million items with more than 39 million books and other print materials,&lt;ref name="FFStats" /&gt; against approximately 150 million items with 25 million books for the British Library.&lt;ref name="aboutbrit"/&gt; A 2000 study by information scientists [[Peter Lyman]] and [[Hal Varian]] suggested that the amount of uncompressed [[Text file|textual data]] represented by the 26 million books then in the collection was 10 [[terabyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info/how-much-info.pdf#page=110| first1=Peter| last1=Lyman| first2=Hal R.| last2=Varian| title=How Much Information?| accessdate=2013-10-14| date=18 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library also administers the [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]], an audio book and [[braille]] library program provided to more than 766,000 Americans.

=== Digitization ===
The Library's first digitization project was called "[[American Memory]]." Launched in 1990, it initially planned to choose 160 million objects from its collection to make digitally available on [[LaserDisc|laserdiscs]] and [[Compact disc|CDs]] that would be distributed to schools and libraries. After realizing that this plan would be too expensive and inefficient, and with the rise of the Internet, the Library decided to instead make digitized material available over the Internet. This project was made official in the National Digital Library Program (NDLP), created in October 1994. By 1999, the NDLP had succeeded in digitizing over 5 million objects and had a budget of $12 million. The Library has kept the "American Memory" name for its public domain website, which today contains 15 million digital objects, comprising over 7 [[petabyte]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/the-library-of-last-resort/|title=The Library of Last Resort|last=Chayka|first=Kyle|date=2016-07-14|website=|publisher=n+1 Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Memory is a source for [[public domain]] image resources, as well as audio, video, and archived Web content. Nearly all of the lists of holdings, the ''catalogs'' of the library, can be consulted directly on its web site. Librarians all over the world consult these catalogs, through the Web or through other media better suited to their needs, when they need to catalog for their collection a book published in the United States. They use the [[Library of Congress Control Number]] to make sure of the exact identity of the book. Digital images are also available at [[Snapshots of the Past]], which provides archival prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.snapshotsofthepast.com/about-us|title=About Us|website=Snapshots of the Past|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library has a budget of between $6–8 million each year for digitization, meaning that not all works can be digitized. It makes determinations about what objects to prioritize based on what is especially important to Congress or potentially interesting for the public. The 15 million digitized items represent less than 10% of the Library's total 160-million item collection.

The Library has chosen not to participate in other digital library projects such as [[Google Books]] and the [[Digital Public Library of America]], although it has supported the [[Internet Archive]] project.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Library of Congress also provides an online archive of the proceedings of the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] at [[THOMAS]], including bill text, [[Congressional Record]] text, bill summary and status, the Congressional Record Index, and the [[United States Constitution]].

The Library of Congress is physically housed in three buildings on Capitol Hill and a conservation center in rural [[Virginia]]. The Library's Capitol Hill buildings are all connected by underground passageways, so that a library user need pass through security only once in a single visit. The library also has off-site storage facilities for less commonly requested materials.

===Thomas Jefferson Building===
{{Main|Thomas Jefferson Building}}
The Thomas Jefferson Building is located between [[Independence Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Independence Avenue]] and East Capitol Street on First Street SE. It first opened in 1897 as the main building of the Library and is the oldest of the three buildings. Known originally as the Library of Congress Building or Main Building, it took its present name on June 13, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/walls/ |title=On These Walls: Inscriptions and Quotations in the Buildings of the Library of Congress |last=Cole |first=John |publisher=Scala Arts Publishers Inc. |year=2008 |isbn=978-1857595451 |chapter=The Thomas Jefferson Building |access-date=2018-04-23 |chapter-url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/walls/jeff1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Adams Building===
{{Main|John Adams Building}}
The John Adams Building is located between Independence Avenue and East Capitol Street on 2nd Street SE, the block adjacent to the Jefferson Building. The building was originally known as The Annex to the Main Building, which had run out of space. It opened its doors to the public January 3, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/walls/ |title=On These Walls: Inscriptions and Quotations in the Buildings of the Library of Congress |last=Cole |first=John |publisher=Scala Arts Publishers Inc. |year=2008 |isbn=978-1857595451 |chapter=The John Adams Building |access-date=2018-04-23 |chapter-url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/walls/adams.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Madison Memorial Building===
{{Main|James Madison Memorial Building}}
The James Madison Memorial Building is located between First and Second Streets on Independence Avenue SE. The building was constructed from 1971 to 1976, and serves as the official memorial to President James Madison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/walls/ |title=On These Walls: Inscriptions and Quotations in the Buildings of the Library of Congress |last=Cole |first=John |publisher=Scala Arts Publishers Inc. |year=2008 |isbn=978-1857595451 |chapter=The James Madison Memorial Building |access-date=2018-04-23 |chapter-url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/walls/madison.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Madison Building is also home to the Mary Pickford Theater, the "motion picture and television reading room" of the Library of Congress. The theater hosts regular free screenings of classic and contemporary movies and television shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/mopic/pickford/ |title=Mary Pickford Theater Film Schedule |website=Moving Image Research Center |publisher=Library of Congres |access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation===
{{Main|National Audio-Visual Conservation Center}}
The Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation is the Library of Congress's newest building, opened in 2007 and located in [[Culpeper, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/avconservation/packard/|title=The Packard Campus - A/V Conservation (Library of Congress)|website=Loc.gov|accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed out of a former [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] storage center and [[Cold War]] bunker. The campus is designed to act as a single site to store all of the library's movie, television, and sound collections. It is named to honor [[David Woodley Packard]], whose [[Packard Humanities Institute]] oversaw design and construction of the facility. The centerpiece of the complex is a reproduction [[Art Deco]] movie theater that presents free movie screenings to the public on a semi-weekly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/events/#eventlist9 |title=Library of Congress events listing |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital Millennium Copyright Act==
{{Main|Digital Millennium Copyright Act#Anti-circumvention exemptions|l1=Digital Millennium Copyright Act}}
{{See also|Librarian of Congress|Register of Copyrights}}

The Library of Congress, through both the Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights, is responsible for authorizing exceptions to [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap12.html#1201 Section 1201] of [[Title 17 of the United States Code]] as part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This process is done every three years, with the Register receiving proposals from the public and acting as an advisor to the Librarian, who issues a ruling on what is exempt.  After three years have passed, the ruling is no longer valid and a new ruling on exemptions must be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.copyright.gov/1201/ |title=Section 1201: Exemptions to Prohibition Against Circumvention of Technological Measures Protecting Copyrighted Works| work=United States Copyright Office| year=2013| accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2013/13-041.html|title=Statement Regarding White House Response to 1201 Rulemaking {{!}} News Releases - Library of Congress|work=Library of Congress|year=2013|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
The library is open for academic research to anyone with a Reader Identification Card. One may not remove library items from the reading rooms or the library buildings. Most of the Library's general collection of books and journals is in the closed stacks of the Jefferson and Adams Buildings; specialized collections of books and other materials are in closed stacks in all three main Library buildings, or are stored off-site. Access to the closed stacks is not permitted under any circumstances, except to authorized Library staff, and occasionally, to dignitaries. Only the reading room reference collections are on open shelves.

Since 1902, American libraries have been able to request books and other items through [[interlibrary loan]] from the Library of Congress if these items are not readily available elsewhere. Through this system, the Library of Congress has served as a "library of last resort", according to former Librarian of Congress [[Herbert Putnam]].&lt;ref name="interlibrary loan"/&gt; The Library of Congress lends books to other libraries with the stipulation that they be used only inside the borrowing library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/loan/loanweb1.html |title=Subpage Title (Interlibrary Loan, Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==
In addition to its library services, the Library of Congress is also actively involved in various standard activities in areas related to bibliographical and search and retrieve standards. Areas of work include [[MARC standards]], [[Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard]] (METS), [[Metadata Object Description Schema]] (MODS), [[Z39.50]] and [[Search/Retrieve Web Service]] (SRW), and [[Search/Retrieve via URL]] (SRU).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/|title=Standards at the Library of Congress|last=|first=|date=|website=Loc.gov|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Law Library of Congress]] seeks to further legal scholarship by providing opportunities for scholars and practitioners to conduct significant legal research. Individuals are invited to apply for projects which would further the multi-faceted mission of the Law Library in serving the U.S. Congress, other governmental agencies, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/opportunities/|title=Research &amp; Educational Opportunities - Law Library of Congress|website=Loc.gov|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36667">On this page, '''''environmental lawsuit''''' means "a lawsuit where the well-being of an environmental asset or the well-being of a set of environmental assets is in dispute".  Also on this page, '''''lawsuit with environmental relevance''''' means "a lawsuit where a non-environmental entity or a set of non-environmental entities is in dispute, but whose outcome has relevance for an environmental asset or for a set of environmental assets".

Because the distinction between the two types of lawsuit is not clearly defined, it is beneficial to keep the two lists together on one page, but separated according to that distinction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4518">'''Margaret of Villehardouin''' (Greek: Μαργαρίτα Βιλλεαρδουίνου; 1266 – February/March 1315) was the daughter of [[William II of Villehardouin]], [[Prince of Achaea]], and his third wife [[Anna Komnene Doukaina]]. 

In ca. 1276, her father granted her two thirds (16 knights' fiefs) of the [[Barony of Akova]].{{sfn|Bon|1969|pp=105, 147–148, 394}} After William II's death in 1278, as he had no sons, per the [[Treaty of Viterbo]], the princely title passed to the King of [[Sicily]], [[Charles of Anjou]], the father-in-law of Margaret's elder sister [[Isabella of Villehardouin|Isabella]]. Her mother Anna retained only the Villehardouins' patrimonial domain, the [[Barony of Kalamata]], and the fortress of [[Chlemoutsi]], but was forced to give them up in 1282 in exchange for lands elsewhere in [[Messenia]]. Margaret remained under her mother's guardianship until Anna's death on 4 January 1286.{{sfn|Bon|1969|pp=137, 152–153, 156–157}}

In 1304, she claimed from her brother-in-law, Prince [[Philip I of Piedmont|Philip of Savoy]], one fifth of the [[Principality of Achaea]], but was rebuffed. She repeated her claim, this time for the entire principality, on the death of her sister Isabella in 1312. Margaret's claim rested on her interpretation of the Treaty of Viterbo, which stipulated the creation of such a fief, but only for a male descendant of William II. A later document dated to 1344 also asserts that William had included in his will the stipulation that Margaret would inherit her sister, if the latter died childless, but Isabella had two daughters. In addition, when Charles of Anjou gave the Principality to Isabella in 1289, he explicitly limited her heirs to her own descendants. As J. Longnon commented, her rights on Achaea were "more than doubtful", and her claims were again disregarded by the principality's suzerain, [[Philip I, Prince of Taranto|Philip of Taranto]], in favour of her niece [[Matilda of Hainaut]] and her husband, [[Louis of Burgundy]].{{sfn|Longnon|1949|p=305}}

In order to gain support for her claims, in February 1314 Margaret visited Sicily in order to wed her only daughter, [[Isabella of Sabran]] to the ''[[Infante]]'' [[Ferdinand of Majorca]], who, as a landless prince, was eager to claim the princely title of Achaea. Ferdinand was quickly enamoured of Isabella—described by the Catalan chronicler [[Ramon Muntaner]] as "the most beautiful creature one could possibly behold" and "the wisest lady in the world"—and the wedding was celebrated at [[Messina]] on 14 February 1314 in great pomp.{{sfn|Longnon|1949|p=305}} Margaret passed her titles and claims to them, and returned to Achaea, where she was imprisoned by the Angevin ''[[bailli]]'' [[Nicholas le Maure]] at the castle of [[Chlemoutsi]], where she died in February or March 1315.{{sfn|Bon|1969|pp=190–191}} Ferdinand invaded Achaea and tried to claim the Principality from Louis of Burgundy, but despite initial success fell in the [[Battle of Manolada]] in July 1316, and the remnants of the Majorcan army withdrew soon after.{{sfn|Bon|1969|pp=191–193}}

== Family ==
She married first in September 1294 with [[Isnard of Sabran]] and had one daughter, [[Isabella of Sabran]], who married the [[Ferdinand of Majorca]], son of [[James II of Majorca]]. Isnard died in 1297.{{sfn|Bon|1969|p=697}} Her second marriage was to [[Richard I Orsini]], [[County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos|Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos]], in 1299. The couple had an unnamed daughter who died as an infant.{{sfn|Bon|1969|pp=176, 697, 706}}

'''Micropower radio''' is a subset of [[pirate radio]] concerned with low-power [[radio]] [[broadcasting]], usually less than about 100 [[watt]]s radiated [[Power (physics)|power]] and sometimes less than 0.1 watt. Micropower radio transmits to a number of recipients ("listeners" or "viewers") that belong to a small local group. Beginning in the early 1990s, there has been an increase in micropower radio because of the desire for such a service in local communities. Micropower radio gives an avenue for small groups and individuals to provide local neighborhood or community broadcasts of information, diverse programming, and entertainment. Micropower radio is ''usually'' a  non-commercial service.

The '''Microradio Movement''' in the United States aims to change radio licensing laws. While never his intent to found a movement, [[Mbanna Kantako]], founder of the Human Rights Radio Network, is often referred to as the founder or grandfather of the Microradio Movement.

In the US, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) requires AM/FM [[radio]] and [[Television|TV]] stations without a [[LPFM|Low Power FM]] (LPFM) license to transmit with at least 6000 Watts of power. The FCC is not currently offering any LPFM licenses. This makes the cost of setting up a radio station prohibitive for individuals and small communities.

{{Criminal law}}
A '''misdemeanor''' ([[American English]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=misdemeanour|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/misdemeanour?a=british|website=Cambridge Dictionary|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; spelled '''misdemeanour''' in [[British English]]) is any "lesser" [[crime|criminal]] act in some [[common law]] legal systems.  Misdemeanors are generally [[punishment|punished]] less severely than [[felony|felonies]], but theoretically more so than administrative [[infraction]]s (also known as minor, petty, or [[summary offence]]s) and [[regulatory offence]]s. Many misdemeanors are punished with monetary fines.

== Distinction between felonies and misdemeanors ==
A misdemeanor is considered a crime of low seriousness, and a [[felony]] one of high seriousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classification of Crimes|url=https://open.lib.umn.edu/criminallaw/chapter/1-4-classification-of-crimes/|website=M Libraries Publishing|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A principle of the rationale for the degree of punishment meted out is that the punishment should fit the crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Doing Justice: The Choice of Punishments'', A VONHIRSCH, 1976, p.220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Criminology'', Larry J. Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Economic Analysis of the Criminal Law as Preference-Shaping Policy'', Duke Law Journal, Feb 1990, Vol. 1, Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, {{jstor|1372651}}&lt;/ref&gt; One standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. Measurements of the degree of seriousness of a crime have been developed.&lt;ref name=OSS&gt;''Offense Seriousness Scaling: An Alternative to Scenario Methods'', Journal of Quantitative Criminology, Volume 9, Number 3, 309-322, {{doi|10.1007/BF01064464}} 
James P. Lynch and Mona J. E. Danner, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/k82650582x366612/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the federal government generally considers a crime punishable with incarceration for one year or less to be a misdemeanor. All other crimes are considered felonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:18%20section:3559%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-section3559)&amp;f=treesort&amp;edition=prelim&amp;num=0&amp;jumpTo=true |title=18 USC 3559: Sentencing classification of offenses |last= |first= |date=1 November 1987 |website=uscode.house.gov |publisher= |access-date=6 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states also employ the same or a similar distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is a Misdemeanor|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-misdemeanor|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between felonies and misdemeanors has been abolished by several [[common law]] jurisdictions (notably the UK&lt;ref&gt;[http://karate-site.co.uk/pdfs/criminal-law-act-1967.pdf Criminal Law Act 1967 s.1, in force 1 Jan 1968]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca195882/s322b.html Crimes Act 1958 (Vic., Australia) s. 332B(1)], [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s580e.html Crimes Act 1900 (NSW., Australia) s. 580E(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; These jurisdictions have generally adopted some other classification (in the UK the substance of the original distinction remains, only slightly altered): in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]] of [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victimsofcrime.vic.gov.au/home/charges+laid/types+of+offences/|title=Types of offences|last=Justice|first=VOC, Department of|website=www.victimsofcrime.vic.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/justice/criminal-justice/bcs-criminal-justice-system/if-you-are-accused-of-a-crime/understanding-charges/types-of-offences|title=Types of Offences - Province of British Columbia|last=Justice|first=Ministry of|last2=General|first2=Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor|website=www2.gov.bc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.govt.nz/about/lawyers-and-service-providers/criminal-procedure-act/offence-categories-and-types-of-trials/|title=Offence categories &amp; types of trials {{!}} New Zealand Ministry of Justice|website=www.justice.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/summary_offences_and_the_crown_court/|title=Summary Offences and the Crown Court: Legal Guidance: The Crown Prosecution Service|website=www.cps.gov.uk|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/courts/magistrates-courts|title=Criminal courts - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the crimes are divided into [[summary offence]]s and [[indictable offence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.findlaw.com.au/faqs/1188/what-is-the-difference-between-a-summary-and-indic.aspx|title=What is the difference between a summary and indictable offence?|website=www.findlaw.com.au|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of Ireland]], a former member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], also uses these divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dppireland.ie/filestore/documents/Chapter_2_The_Prosecution_System_in_Ireland.htm|title=Guidelines for Prosecutors - Director of Public Prosecutions|last=Prosecutions|first=Office of the Director of Public|website=www.dppireland.ie|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== When a misdemeanor becomes a felony ==
In the United States of America, even if a criminal charge for the defendant's conduct is normally a misdemeanor, sometimes a repeat offender will be charged with a felony offense. For example, the first time a person commits certain crimes, such as spousal assault, it is normally a misdemeanor, but the second time it may become a felony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bergman, Paul, and Sara J. Berman-Barrett. The Criminal Law Handbook: Know Your Rights, Survive the System. Berkeley, CA: Nolo, 2011. Print|last = |first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typical misdemeanors and sentences ==
[[Image:Graffiti in Bucharest, July 2007.jpg|thumb|left|In the US, [[graffiti]] is a common form of misdemeanor [[vandalism]], although in many states it is now a felony.]]
In some jurisdictions, those who are [[convict]]ed of a misdemeanor are known as '''misdemeanants''' (as contrasted with those convicted of a [[felony]] who are known as ''felons''). Depending on the jurisdiction, examples of misdemeanors may include: [[theft|petty theft]], [[prostitution]], [[public intoxication]], [[assault|simple assault]], [[disorderly conduct]], [[trespass]], [[vandalism]], [[reckless driving]], discharging a firearm within city limits, possession of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and in some jurisdictions first-time possession of certain other drugs, and other similar crimes.

=== Punishments for misdemeanors ===

Misdemeanors usually do not result in the loss of civil rights, but may result in loss of privileges, such as professional licenses, public offices, or public employment.  Such effects are known as the [[collateral consequences of criminal charges]].  This is more common when the misdemeanor is related to the privilege in question (such as the loss of a [[Taxicab|taxi]] driver's license after a conviction for [[reckless driving]]), or when the misdemeanor involves [[moral turpitude]]—and in general is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

===United States===

In the United States, misdemeanors are typically crimes with a maximum punishment of 12 months of [[incarceration]], typically in a local [[County jail|jail]] as contrasted with felons, who are typically incarcerated in a [[prison]]. Jurisdictions such as Massachusetts are a notable exception where the maximum punishment of some misdemeanors is up to 2.5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/admin/sentcomm/mastercrimelist.pdf|title=Felony and Master Crime List|last=|first=|date=December 2015|website=www.mass.gov/courts|publisher=Massachusetts Sentencing Commission|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who are convicted of misdemeanors are often punished with [[probation]], [[community service]], short [[County jail|jail]] term, or part-time incarceration such as a sentence that may be served on the weekends.

The [[United States Constitution]] provides that the President may be [[impeached]] and subsequently removed from office if found guilty by Congress for "high crimes and misdemeanors". As used in the Constitution, the term ''misdemeanor'' refers broadly to criminal acts as opposed to employing the felony-misdemeanor distinction used in modern criminal codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schick v. United States, 195 U.S. 65, 24 S.Ct. 826, 49 L.Ed. 99 (1904)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10977065371937092299|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of what constitutes a "high crime" or "misdemeanor" for purposes of impeachment is left to the judgment of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowman|first1=Frank O.|last2=Sepinuck|first2=Stephen L.|title=High Crimes and Misdemeanors: Defining the Constitutional Limits on Presidential Impeachment|journal=Southern California Law Review|date=1999|volume=72|issue=6|page=1517|url=http://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1074&amp;context=facpubs|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===

In [[Singapore]], misdemeanors generally are sentenced to months{{Clarify|date=April 2012}} of [[jail sentence]] but with individual crimes{{Clarify|date=April 2012}} suspects are sentenced to a harsher sentence. The penalty of [[vandalism]] is a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] not exceeding S$2,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years, and also [[corporal punishment]] of not less than three strokes and not more than eight strokes of the cane.

== Misdemeanor classes ==
[[File:Macro cannabis bud.jpg|thumb|left|Possession of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] may be an unclassified misdemeanor in parts of the [[United States|US]].]]
Depending on the jurisdiction, several classes of misdemeanors may exist; the forms of punishment can vary widely between those classes. For example, the federal and some [[U.S. state|state]] governments in the [[United States]] divide misdemeanors into several classes, with certain classes punishable by jail time and others carrying only a fine.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{usc|18|3559}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In New York law, a Class A Misdemeanor carries a maximum sentence of one year of imprisonment, while a Class B Misdemeanor "shall not exceed three months".&lt;ref&gt;N.Y.

Accessed August 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unclassified misdemeanors ===
In the United States, when a statute does not specify the class of a misdemeanor, it may be referred to as an ''unclassified misdemeanor''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Criminal Justice System for Adults in NYS|url=https://www.omh.ny.gov/omhweb/forensic/manual/html/chapter1.htm|website=Office of Mental Health|publisher=New York State|accessdate=19 November 2017}}, {{cite web|title=Misdemeanor and Criminal Violation Cases|url=http://www.courts.oregon.gov/Lane/CriminalandTraffic/pages/misdemean.aspx|website=Lane County Circuit Court|publisher=Oregon Judicial Department|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislators usually enact such laws when they wish to impose penalties that fall outside the framework specified by each class.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} For example, [[Virginia]] has four classes of misdemeanors, with Class 1 and Class 2 misdemeanors being punishable by twelve-month and six-month jail sentences, respectively, and Class 3 and Class 4 misdemeanors being non-jail offenses payable by fines.&lt;ref name="leg1.state.va.us"&gt;[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-11 § 18.2-11.

==England and Wales==
All distinctions between felony and misdemeanour were abolished by section 1(1) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]. Prior to this, a person prosecuted for misdemeanour was called a [[defendant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]]. A First Book of English Law. [[Sweet and Maxwell]].

'''Modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin''' are the efforts from 1538 AD until the present day to renew the [[Sanhedrin]] which was dissolved in 358 AD by the edict of the Byzantine emperor. [Though 358 was the last formal meeting, there is no record of when it was actually dissolved and by whom, nor any reference to the last nasi's execution.] The latest effort was in 2004 when a group of seventy one [[rabbi]]s claiming to represent varied communities in [[Israel]] undertook a ceremony in [[Tiberias]], where the original Sanhedrin was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= haaretz.com |date=January 18, 2010 |title= Present-day Sanhedrin court seeks to revive ancient Temple rituals |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/831646.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= jpost.com |date=January 18, 2010 |title= Re-starting the Jewish heart |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1213794282406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnn.com/data/asx2004/10/20/asx_1159_300.asx Ceremony by rabbis]&lt;/ref&gt; That group claimed to re-establish the body, based on the proposal of [[Maimonides]] and the Jewish legal rulings of Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/page.do/17929/The_Sanhedrin_Reestablished_%28Part_I%29.html The Sanhedrin Reestablished - Part I] (17 May 2006) (Jewish Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/page.do/18317/The_Sanhedrin_Reestablished_%28Part_II%29.html The Sanhedrin Reestablished - Part II] (31 May 2006) (Jewish Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/page.do/18385/Focus_On_Israel.html The Sanhedrin Reestablished - Part III] (7 June 2006) (Jewish Press)&lt;/ref&gt;  As of March 2010, that effort is ongoing.

==Sanhedrin in Judaism==
The Sanhedrin is traditionally viewed as the last institution which commanded universal authority among the Jewish people in the long chain of tradition from [[Moses]] until the present day. Since its dissolution in 358 CE,&lt;ref&gt;The dissolution of the Sanhedrin, in terms of its power to give binding universal decisions, is usually dated to 358CE when [[Hillel II]]'s mathematical [[Jewish Calendar]] was adopted. This marked the last universally accepted decision made by that body.&lt;/ref&gt; there has been no universally recognized authority within [[Halakha|Jewish law (Halakha)]].

[[Maimonides]] (1135–1204) was one of the greatest scholars on Judaism of the [[Middle Ages]], and is arguably one of the most widely known scholars among the Jewish people. Influenced by the rationalist school of thought and generally showing a preference for a natural (as opposed to miraculous) redemption for the Jewish people, Maimonides proposed a rationalist solution for achieving the goal of re-establishing the highest court in Jewish tradition and reinvesting it with the same authority it had in former years. There have been several attempts to implement Maimonides' recommendations, the latest being in modern times.

==The dissolution of the classical Sanhedrin==
By the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, the Sanhedrin achieved its quintessential position, legislating on all aspects of Jewish religious and political life within the parameters laid down by Biblical and Rabbinic tradition.

After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the Sanhedrin was re-established in [[Yavne]]h by agreement between [[Yochanan ben Zakai]] and Roman Emperor [[Vespasian]]. Vespasian agreed in part due to the perception that the [[Pharisees]] had not participated in the [[First Jewish-Roman War|first revolt]] to the extent that other groups had. Thus the Sanhedrin in Yavneh was comprised almost exclusively of [[pharisaic]] scholars. The imperial Roman government recognized the Sanhedrin. They regarded the [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|head of the Sanhedrin]] as their own paid government official with the status of Prefect. Roman legislation severely reduced the scope of its authority, but confirmed the body's ultimate authority in religious matters. In an attempt to quash revolutionary elements, Rome in effect declared one form of Judaism to be the only recognized form of religion. This led to persecution of sectarian groups, and attempts by these groups to find fault with the Sanhedrin before the Roman government.

The Sanhedrin moved from Yavneh to [[Usha (ancient)|Usha]] under the presidency of [[Shimon ben Gamliel|Gamaliel II]] in 80. In 116 it moved back to Yavneh, and again back to Usha. It moved in 140 to [[Shefa-'Amr|Shefaram]] under the presidency of [[Shimon ben Gamliel II]], and to [[Beth Shearim]] and [[Tzippori|Sephoris]] in 163, under the presidency of [[Judah haNasi]]. Finally, it moved to [[Tiberias]] in 193, under the presidency of [[Gamaliel III]] (193-220) ben [[Judah haNasi]], where it became more of a consistory, but still retained, under the presidency of [[Judah II]] (220-270), the power of excommunication.

During the presidency of [[Gamaliel IV]] (270-290), it dropped the name Sanhedrin, and its authoritative decisions were subsequently issued under the name of ''[[Yeshiva|Beth HaMidrash]]''.

As a reaction to the emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]'s pro-Jewish stance, [[Theodosius I]] forbade the Sanhedrin to assemble and declared [[Semicha|ordination]] illegal. (Roman law prescribed capital punishment for any Rabbi who received ordination and complete destruction of the town where the ordination occurred).

However, since the [[Hebrew calendar]] was based on witnesses' testimony, that had become far too dangerous to collect, [[Hillel II]] recommended change to a mathematically based calendar that was adopted at a clandestine, and maybe final, meeting in 358. This marked the last universal decision made by that body.

[[Gamaliel VI]] (400-425) was the Sanhedrin's last president. With the death of this patriarch, executed by [[Theodosius II]] for erecting new synagogues contrary to the imperial decree, use of the title [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]], the last remains of the ancient Sanhedrin, became illegal after 425.

There are records of what may have been of attempts to reform the Sanhedrin in Arabia,&lt;ref name="alsadiqin"&gt;[http://www.alsadiqin.org/history/The%20Persian%20conquest%20of%20Jerusalem%20in%20614CE%20compared%20with%20Islamic%20conquest%20of%20638CE.pdf The Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614CE compared with Islamic conquest of 638CE]&lt;/ref&gt; in Jerusalem under the Calif 'Umar,&lt;ref name="alsadiqin"/&gt; and in Babylon (Iraq),&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Yuchsin'', cf. ''Yarchei Kallah'', Rabbi Nassan describes "the seventy judges who comprise the Sanhedrin"&lt;/ref&gt; but none of these attempts were given any attention by Rabbinic authorities and little information is available about them.

==Maimonides' semicha by consensus==
Maimonides was one of the greatest scholars of the Middle Ages, and is arguably one of the most widely accepted scholars among the Jewish people since the closing of the Talmud in 500 CE.

Influenced by the rationalist school of thought and generally showing a preference for a natural (as opposed to miraculous) redemption for the Jewish people, Maimonides records that it is an absolute, binding requirement of the Jewish people in every generation to set up a Sanhedrin and courts of law. Faced with the demise of classical [[Semicha]] (Biblical ordination), he tentatively proposed a rationalist solution for achieving the goal of re-establishing the highest court in Jewish tradition and reinvesting it with the same authority it had in former years.

Maimonides writes:
:It appears to me [Maimonides] that if all the sages of the Land of Israel consent to appoint ''dayanim'' (judges) and grant them ''semichah'' (ordination), they have the law of ''musmachim'' and they can judge penalty cases and are authorized to grant ''semichah'' to others [thus restoring Biblical ordination].

:If so, why did the sages bemoan [the loss of] ''semichah''? So that the judgment of penalty cases wouldn't disappear from among Israel because Jews are so spread out that it's not possible to get their consent [to authorize a ''dayan'']. If someone were to receive ''semichah'' from someone who already has ''semichah'', then he does not require their consent – he may judge penalty cases for everyone since he received ''semichah'' from ''beis din'' (rabbinical court). However, this matter requires a final decision.
:''(Rambam, Hilchos Sanhedrin 4:11)''

The wording of this teaching is vague and tentative and leaves several points open. Firstly, it opens with "It appears to me" and ends with "this matter requires a final decision". Secondly, it is not specified what is meant by "consent". Thirdly, it leaves open as to who are "all the sages of the Land of Israel" and lastly - although not apparent here - what is really meant by the word "all". These questions led to significant debate within Rabbinic circles, from those who completely disregarded this teaching to others who differed on its meaning.

The differing interpretations gradually coalesced by the time of [[Joseph ben Ephraim Karo|Yosef Karo]] who recorded as definitive Jewish law that ordination could be established by consensus, and accepted such ordination himself. While Rabbi Yosef Karo's magnum opus, the [[Shulchan Aruch]], is considered the most authoritative collection of Jewish Law in use today, his views on this subject are not widely known.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Yosef Karo's treatise ''Maaseh Beis Din'' and his commentary the ''Beis Yosef'', ''Choshen Mishpat 295'', see also Rabbi Yakov Beirav ''Iggeret Hasemicha''&lt;/ref&gt; In general, religious Jews not familiar with his writings on the subject tend to reject outright the notion of establishing a Sanhedrin by consensus.

The matter of restoring semicha by consensus has been a matter of dispute within the orthodox community. Against the view are such authorities as the Rabbi [[Avraham Yeshayah Karelitz]] (the ''Chazon Ish''), who quoted Rabbi [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|David ibn abi Zimra]] (the ''Radvaz'') on the subject, who in turn sided with Rabbi [[Levi Ibn Chaviv]] (the ''Ralbach''),&lt;ref name=Ralbach/&gt; who based his claims on the ''[[Nahmanides|Rabbi Moses ben Nachman (Ramban)]]''&lt;ref name=Ramban/&gt; that it is impossible to form a Sanhedrin before Moshiach, the Jewish messiah, comes.

On the other hand, authorities based on Maimonides&lt;ref&gt;''Mishne Torah, Hilchos Sanhedrin 4:11''&lt;/ref&gt; and Rabbi Yosef Karo,&lt;ref&gt;''Choshen Mishpat 295''&lt;/ref&gt; author of the Shulchan Aruch, were of the opinion that semicha could be established by consensus and a Sanhedrin could be formed without waiting for Moshiach. Rabbi Yisrael of Shklov, the leading disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]], wrote in the name of the Gaon that there was no need to wait for Moshiach before forming a Sanhedrin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/sinay/nisyono-4.htm The attempt of Rabbi Yisrael of Shklov to re-establish the Sanhedrin in 1830]&lt;/ref&gt; (Cf. [[Semicha#Attempt by Rabbi Yisroel Shklover.2C 1830|Attempt by Rabbi Yisroel Shklover, 1830]] to revive [[Semicha]].)

==A brief summary of the last five rabbinical attempts to create a Sanhedrin==
A discussion of the last five rabbinical attempts to reinstate [[Semicha]] can be found in the Wikipedia entry on Semicha. Rabbi Bavad, a member of the new Sanhedrin, gives a brief discussion of those attempts and how they affected the most recent attempt.&lt;ref&gt;''HaSanhedrin HaSamchut VeHaChiddush'', Appendix I, by Rabbi Bavad, Beit El Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

*Attempt by Rabbi [[Jacob Berab]] in 1538. Rabbi Berab assembled 25 of the most leading Rabbis of the Holy Land, who at the time were located in Safed, and re-instituted the Semicha. They convened and ordained Rabbi Berab as their "[[Chief Rabbi]]". The Rabbis of Jerusalem felt a slight on their honor and declared the election invalid, and a major dispute ensued. Some Rabbis held that it wasn't possible to renew the Semicha, but Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]], author of the [[Shulchan Aruch]], took the position that the procedure was valid and he was one of four Rabbi ordained by Rabbi Berab. Rabbi Karo in turn ordained Rabbi [[Moshe Alshich]] who in turn ordained Rabbi [[Hayyim Vital]] the prime disciple of the [[Isaac Luria|Ari Hakodosh]]. The new Sanhedrin has modeled its actions after this attempt.
*Attempt by Rabbi [[Yisroel of Shklov]] in 1830. In Rabbi Yisroel's lifetime the Turkish empire was crumbling, and for the first time in almost a thousand years westerners were being allowed into Yemen. Scientific journals of the time seriously speculated that the remnants of the [[lost ten tribes]] would be found. Based on Jewish traditions and "scientific evidence" Rabbi Yisroel sent an emissary to obtain [[Semicha]] from these lost tribes. In the end, no remnant was found, however the responses involved in this shed light on the [[Vilna Gaon]]'s position that it was permissible to attempt to re-establish the Sanhedrin.
*Attempt by Rabbi Aharon Mendel haCohen in 1901. Rabbi Mendel collected the approval of approximately 500 leading Rabbis in favor of the renewal of Semicha according to Maimonides. His involvement in the founding of [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]] and the breakout of [[World War I]] distracted him from implementing this plan. The new Sanhedrin bases its use of phones, fax and regular mail rather than physically assembling "all the scholars of the Land of Israel" on the rabbinical responsa surrounding this attempt.
*Attempt by Rabbi Zvi Kovsker in 1940. Rabbi Zvi Kovsker came to Israel from Soviet Russia. Seeing the condition of Jews in the years leading up to [[World War II]], he undertook an effort to contact and work with many Rabbinic leaders in Israel towards getting their approval for the renewal of Semicha, and the reestablishment of a Sanhedrin, as an authentic government for the Jewish people (this was before the establishment of the State of Israel). His efforts to lobby the Rabbinic leaders were the model for twenty years of groundwork and discussions by the organizers of the new Sanhedrin.
*Attempt by Rabbi [[Yehuda Leib Maimon]] in 1949. Rabbi Maimon proposed turning the Israeli Rabbinate into a Sanhedrin. The perceived subordinate position to the government of Israel was compared to [[Grand Sanhedrin|Napoleon's Sanhedrin]], and led to strong vocal opposition by most [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] rabbis. Israel's Chief Ashkenazi rabbi at the time Rabbi [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]], was hesitant to support this goal, and the idea eventually died away.

==Rabbi Beirav, the model for the current attempt==
A closer look at the attempt by Rabbi Beirav,&lt;ref&gt;Based on [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=789&amp;letter=B&amp;search=Berab Jewish Encyclopedia: BERAB, JACOB], Rabbi Tzvi Eidan's ''Asot Mishpat'', and also [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928164513/http://www.thebronsteins.com/archives/000477.html Semicha and Sanhedrin Controversies by Rabbi Yirmiyohu Kaganoff]&lt;/ref&gt; and the involvement of the Beis Yosef, which was the model for the current attempt:

Rabbi Yakov Berav (1474–1546), known as the Mahari Beirav, was born in Spain. Evidence of the great respect is afforded by the following lines of Rabbi Abraham Gavison in ''Omer ha-Shikchah'': "Say not that the lamp of the Law no longer burns in Israel! Yakov Beirav has come back! once more he sojourns among us!" In 1533 he became Rabbi at Cairo; and several years after he seems to have finally settled in Safed, which then contained the largest and most learned Jewish community in the Land of Israel. After the Spanish expulsion, many Jews remained in Spain, practicing their Judaism in secret, while publicly appearing to be Christians. Thousands of these [[Marrano]] Jews eventually escaped to areas where they could practice their religion with relative freedom, yet they were haunted by the sins they had committed in previous years. As chief Rabbi of Safed, Rabbi Yakov Beirav proposed the creation of Jewish courts that would carry out the punishment of ''malkos'', lashes, which releases someone from the punishment of ''kareis'', or excision (Mishnah Makos 23a). But in order to create these Jewish courts, classical ordination had to be reinstituted.

===Renewal of semicha===
For a year, Rabbi Yakov Beirav discussed the issues of re-establishment institution of [[semicha]] with the scholars of Safed. After much discussion the scholars at Safed came to the conclusion that [[Maimonides]]' view was correct, and that there was a pressing need to re-establish the Sanhedrin. In 1538 twenty-five Rabbis met in an assembly at Safed and ordained Rabbi Yakov Beirav, giving him the right to ordain others who would then form a Sanhedrin. After sending a delegation to Jerusalem, Rabbi Yakov Beirav expounded on Shabbat before all the scholars of Safed the halachic basis of the re-establishment of semicha and its implications, with an intent to dispel any remaining doubts. On hearing of this event, approximately two hundred scholars, most of the scholars in Land of Israel, also expressed their consent. To obtain the good-will of the scholars of Jerusalem, Rabbi Yakov Beirav sent Rabbi Shlomo Chazan to inform them of the reinstitution of semicha and to obtain their approval. He extended semicha to the chief Rabbi at Jerusalem, Levi ben Yakov ibn Chaviv, ([[Levi Ibn Chaviv|Ralbach]]).

===The dispute===
The Ralbach however rejected the semicha. He considered it an insult to his dignity and to the dignity of Jerusalem that so important a change should be effected without consultation of the scholars of Jerusalem. Rabbi Moshe deCastro of Jerusalem also expressed doubts over the applicability of semicha. Because of this opposition some of the scholars of Safed also began to entertain doubts. Rabbi Yakov Beirav again assembled the scholars of Safed, and reviewed the halachic basis for re-establishment of semicha. Rabbi Yosef Karo and others sent a treatise ''Maaseh Beis Din'' to the scholars of Jerusalem explaining the basis for semicha and protesting their opposition to its re-establishment. In the course of time, the Ralbach put his objections to Rabbi Yakov Beirav's semicha in writing, involving additional scholars in the dispute. In response Rabbi Yakov Beirav composed and distributed ''Iggeret Hasemicha'' to settle any halachic doubts. The dispute lasted for a year. In general the scholars outside of Land of Israel did not get involved at this stage in the dispute, with the exception of the Radbaz.

The Ralbach's objections centered around the following points:&lt;ref name=Ralbach&gt;''Shealos v'teshuvos leRalbach'' by Rabbi Levi Ibn Chaviv&lt;/ref&gt;

# The re-establishment of semicha will cause the speeding up of redemption, which is not permitted.
# Maimonides closing words, "This matter requires a final decision" shows that he was not fully decided on this ruling. Since Maimonides was uncertain and [[Nahmanides]] was certain,&lt;ref name=Ramban&gt;''Sefer Hamitzvos, Aseh 153'' by Rabbi Moshe ben Nahman Gerondi (''Ramban'')&lt;/ref&gt; the law follows Nahmanides.
#Lastly that the role of Sanhedrin had to be complete, the Calendar had to immediately change which could cause division among the Jewish people
#Even if Maimonides was correct, because the scholars of Jerusalem were not present the election was invalid.

Rabbi Yakov Beirav countered with the following points:&lt;ref&gt;''Iggeret Hasemicha'' by Rabbi Yakov Beirav&lt;/ref&gt;

#First, that the re-establishment semicha is not interfering with the process of redemption, rather it is simply the fulfillment of a positive mitzvah.
#The Maimonides' closing words refer to a different legal matter.
#There was no problem leaving the Jewish calendar unchanged.
#The most learned scholars lived in Safed and that was sufficient; in Jewish law the word "all" means the "main part". (The Ralbach did not differ with Rabbi Yakov Beirav on this point, only he objected that "all" must include the scholars of Jerusalem. He did not claim that every scholar in all of Land of Israel should be present in the assembly).

In his treatise ''Maaseh Beis Din'',&lt;ref&gt;''Maaseh Beis Din'' by Rabbi Yosef Karo&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Yosef Karo explained Maimonides' principle of "all". There he writes that Maimonides meant that if one Rabbi is willing to defer to the knowledge and wisdom of another Rabbi - those lesser rabbis are already included to the greater rabbis and need not be included in the count of "all" (meaning that the scholars of Jerusalem did not need to be included in the election process). To further show that he held that this opinion, he accepted the Semicha of Rabbi Beirav, and passed it on for several generations.

===Conclusion===
It is known that Rabbi Yosef Karo and Rabbi Moses of Trani were two of the four men ordained by Rabbi Yakov Beirav. The others are assumed to be Rabbi Abraham Shalom and Rabbi Israel de Curial and/or Rabbi [[Yoshiyahu Pinto]]. After weighing the objections of Ralbach, Rabbi Yosef Karo chose to be part of the Mahari Beirav's attempt to reinstate the Sanhedrin in his time. This is the source for the acronym MaRaN, which stands for the words "ordained by two hundred Rabbis" (''Masa'im Rabanan Nismach''). Scholars never criticized Rabbi Yosef Karo for this decision. Though there were arguments over many years about the authority of the Shulchan Aruch until it became universally accepted, yet nowhere does one criticize Rabbi Yosef Karo for the fact that he received semicha from Rabbi Yakov Beirav and transmitted it onward. Rabbi Yosef Karo is known to have used his semicha to ordain Rabbi Moses Alsheich, who in turn, ordained Rabbi Chaim Vital. Thus semicha can be traced for at least four generations. Rabbi Yosef Karo, in his commentary the Beis Yosef (Choshen Mishpat 295), answered the objections of the Ralbach by recording as definitive Jewish law the Maimonides' opinion that semicha can be renewed by consensus.

However this view is not shared by all modern Rabbis, Rabbi Yirmiyohu Kaganoff writes: Although Rav Yosef Karo had received this semicha and ordained Rav Moshe Alshich, it is not clear he utilized the semicha in any other way. Nowhere does he refer to a renewal of semicha, and furthermore, numerous places in Shulchan Aruch would be written differently if its author assumed that a beis din of semuchim existed today. In all these places, he assumes that no beis din today exists that is authorized to paskin on the laws of penalties and punishments... Although Rav Moshe Alshich ordained Rav Chayim Vital (Birkei Yosef, Choshen Mishpat 1:7), who was renowned as the primary disciple of the Arizal, the semicha trail appears to end at this point. There is no indication of anyone continuing the semicha project after this time... according to Rabbi Kaganoff, 'we can assume that the psak of the [[Levi Ibn Chaviv|Ralbach]] and [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|Radvaz]] was accepted that we should not introduce semicha on our own.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928164513/http://www.thebronsteins.com/archives/000477.html Semicha and Sanhedrin Controversies of the 16th and 21st Centuries by Rabbi Yirmiyohu Kaganoff]&lt;/ref&gt;'

'''Network Against Prohibition''' ('''NAP''') is an Australian [[drug law reform]] activist group. It was organised on 7 March 2002, in [[Darwin, Northern Territory]] to response to the [[Australian Labor Party]]'s drug house legislation. The organisations goal is to end prohibition of [[recreational drug use]] and draw attention to the [[human rights abuses]] faced by illicit drug advocates. The organisation provides a number of services, including [[needle exchange]]s, community [[smoke-in]]s, and an email newsletter. A number of NAP members were arrested for disturbing the Northern Territory's legislative assembly in 2002.{{cn|date=September 2012}}

NAP belongs to the [[Australian Injecting and Illicit Drug Users League]] (AIVL) and  [[International Coalition of NGO's for Just and Effective Drugs Policy]] (ICN).

'''Paul Alan Yule''' is an archaeologist at the [[Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg]] (habilitation). His main work targets the archaeology of [[Oman]], [[Yemen]], previously [[India]].

== Education and career ==
Yule studied at the [[University of Minnesota]] (BA), [[New York University]] (MA and PhD) and [[Marburg University]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} His dissertation, ''Early Cretan Seals'', classified and dated the seals from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages of [[Minoan Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Yule, ''Early Cretan Seals: A Study of Chronology''. Marburger Studien zur Vor und Frühgeschichte 4 (Mainz 1981), {{ISBN|3-8053-0490-0}}

Within the framework of the [[Open Access movement]] Yule emphasises the archiving of his research materials and publications as soon as possible so as to make them publicly available. He does this largely by means of the image bank [[heidICON]] and the virtual library [[Propylaeum-Dok]] of the Heidelberg University Library. Since 2005 Yule has experimented in 3D recording and animation in India and Oman with the [[Fachhochschule Mainz]] (i3mainz) and with [[Laura Pecchioli]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Yule, Salt Dough and a Laser Scanner, ''Scientific Computing and Cultural Heritage Contributions in Computational Humanities'', in: [[H.G. Bock]] – [[W. Jäger]] – [[M. Winckler]] (eds.), Heidelberg, 2013, 283–90, {{ISBN|978-3-642-28020-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== South Asian research ==
In the 1980s, with the support of [[Swami Omanand Saraswati]], he catalogued and evaluated metallic artefacts of the so-called [[Copper Hoard Culture]] by means of European methods and models for the first time, whereby numerous finds came to light especially in the [[Kanya Gurukul]] in [[Narela]]/Haryana.&lt;ref&gt;P. Yule, ''The Bronze Age Metalwork of India''. PBF XX,8 (Munich 1985), {{ISBN|3-406-30440-0}}; P. Yule/A. Hauptmann/M.

http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/509/ Online&lt;/ref&gt; These artefacts appear to be non-functional objects, probably used in rituals or simply deposited in hoards, to judge from a lack of use-wear. Far away in [[Odisha]], Yule published a find from a metals period cemetery in [[Sankarjang]] which may be the earliest [[musical instrument]] in India. He documented the early historic fortress at [[Sisupalgarh]] by means of a [[laser scanner]], [[ground penetrating radar]] and a hand-held [[GPS]] receiver.&lt;ref&gt;P.

http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/222/ Online&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Corinna Borchert]], Yule uncovered [[illegal building in India|illegal building]] development within this nationally protected [[Mauryan]] site.&lt;ref&gt;P.

http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2008/146/&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001-2004 in India, Yule documented so-called mud forts and other archaeological sites for the first time, especially in [[Odisha]] along the [[Mahanadi]] and [[Chhattisgarh]]. Images of his work especially in [[Odisha]] appear in the image bank heidICON.&lt;ref&gt;http://heidicon.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/Login?login_error=&amp;easydb=fbr74r6ktj7t3gjchlarjsc674&amp;ts=1400945812 in the pool SAI South Asian Archaeology&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arabian and East African research ==
Yule's study of the prehistory of Oman began from 1982-1987 as a volunteer at the [[Deutsches Bergbau-Museum]] in Bochum together with [[Gerd Weisgerber]]. Yule focussed on the cataloguing of the metal hoard find from [[Ibri-Selme]] (and others as well), which he published with [[Gerd Weisgerber]]. This typological study catalogues the largest hoard of metallic artefacts to occur in the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;P. Yule/G. Weisgerber, ''The Metal Hoard from ʿIbrī/Selme, Sultanate of Oman''. Prähistorische Bronzefunde XX.7 (Stuttgart 2001) {{ISBN|3-515-07153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stashed in an [[Umm an-Nar]] period communal tomb, these date to the [[Early Iron Age]]. In 1987 Yule began his [[habilitation]] on the site of [[Samad al-Shan]] which sheds light on the late pre-Islamic, protoliterate [[Late Iron Age]] population of central Oman.&lt;ref&gt;P. Yule, ''Die Gräberfelder in Samad al Shan (Sultanat Oman) Materialien zu einer Kulturgeschichte'', Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, Orient-Abteilung, Orient-Archäologie Bd. 4 (Rahden 2001) {{ISBN|3-89646-634-8}}
http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/yule2001text&lt;/ref&gt; It comes into view as early as 100 BCE and we lose track of it around 300 CE far prior to the arrival of [[Islam]] in Oman. After 2006 he raised the chronology of the Samad Late Iron Age. The cemetery site, Samad, yields eastern Arabian artefacts of different periods. New excavations were intended to better date the Early Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;P. Yule (ed.), ''Studies in the Archaeology of the Sultanate of Oman'', Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, Orient-Archäologie Bd. 2 (Rahden 1999) {{ISBN|3-89646-632-1}}
http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/propylaeumdok/volltexte/2011/817/&lt;/ref&gt; New was the introduction of alphanumeric abbreviations for site and artefact classes to enable computer processing. In the mid 1990s Yule and Weisgerber mapped and studied the tower tombs of [[Jaylah]] in the eastern part of the [[Jebel Akhdhar (Oman)|Jebel Akhdhar]], which may date to the [[Bronze Age]] [[Umm an-Nar Period]] mid-late 3rd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;P. Yule/G. Weisgerber, The Tower Tombs at Shir, Eastern Hajar, Sultanate of Oman, ''Beiträge zur allgemeinen und vergleichenden Archäologie'' 18, 1998, 183-241, {{ISBN|3-8053-2518-5}}
http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/propylaeumdok/volltexte/2009/291/ Online&lt;/ref&gt; Yule sought unsuccessfully late antique habitation in his excavation at the oasis site of Izki/al-Yemen. Yule updated his thought on Oman in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;P. Yule, ''Cross-roads – Early and Late Iron Age South-eastern Arabia'', Abhandlungen Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft, vol. 30, Wiesbaden 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-447-10127-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For south-eastern Arabia he distinguishes and defines Early and Late Iron Ages. In the Sultanate, the Late Iron Age has two facies. The one known from the most sites is designated [[Samad]] Late Iron Age, the other is the [[période préislamique récente]]&lt;ref&gt;P. Yule, ''Cross-roads – Early and Late Iron Age South-eastern Arabia'', Abhandlungen Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft, vol. 30, Wiesbaden 2014, 62-67&lt;/ref&gt; which mostly French and Belgian colleagues researched and defined in the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mouton, ''La péninsule d’Oman de la fin de l’âge du fer au début de la période sasanide (250 av. – 350 ap. JC)'', BAR International Series 1776, 1992 (printed 2008) {{ISBN|978-1-4073-0264-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years after finishing the actual report, Yule realised the important publications for the excavations at [[al-Akhdhar]], [[al-Wāsiṭ]] tomb W1 and other projects.&lt;ref&gt;P. Yule (ed.), ''Archaeological Research in the Sultanate of Oman''&lt;nowiki&gt;, in: Der Anschnitt Beiheft 28, Bochum 2015 {{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{ISBN|978-3-86757-009-1}}&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, text finished 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the Ministry of Heritage and Culture asked him to document and published an Early Iron Age metal smelting site just inside the [[Empty Quarter]] in Wadi Ḍank, [[ʿUqdat al-Bakrah]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Yule-G. Gernez (eds.), ''Early Iron Age Metal-Working Workshop in the Empty Quarter, Sultanate of Oman '', Universitätsforschungen zur prähistorischen Archäologie, 316, Bonn, 2018, {{ISBN|978-3-7749-4112-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the site of [[Zafar, Yemen|Zafar]], capital of the [[Himyarite Tribal Confederation]], in the Yemenite highlands, field operations continued from 1998 to 2010 with a budget which eventually amounted to 5,300,000 Euros. This project illuminates especially the material culture of the [[Himyarite period]] (110 BCE – 525 CE). Yule excavated most notably a 1.70 m high relief-statue depicted wearing a crown which depicts arguably a Christian (Aksumite?) king. He argues that [[Himyarite culture]] is not really foreign to [[Islam]] which follows, but actually is a sire which passed on its genes. One wonders what Islamic religion and culture would be like without this influence. Excavated finds contradict the characterisation of Himyarite culture especially visual arts as decadent - a term which can be understood in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;P. Yule, ''Himyar–Die Spätantike im Jemen/Late Antique Yemen'', Aichwald 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-929290-35-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yule considered late pre-Islam in the Yemen to be his most important scientific contribution owing to the opportunity to work for several years and the large number of contexted finds.&lt;ref&gt;P. Yule (ed.): ''Ẓafār, Capital of Ḥimyar, Rehabilitation of a ‘Decadent’ Society, Excavations of the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg 1998–2010 in the Highlands of the Yemen'', Abhandlungen Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft, vol. 29, Wiesbaden 2013, {{ISSN 0417-2442}},  {{ISBN|978-3-447-06935-9}}; http://heidicon.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/BildsucheFrames?easydb=fbr74r6ktj7t3gjchlarjsc674, SKVO Zafar / Yemen&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 [[Steffen Wenig]] asked Yule to participate in an excavation project of a church at [[Mifsas Bahri]] in the South Tigray Region. Yule continued this work independently, enabled in 2014 by means of a grant from the DFG.&lt;ref&gt;https://uni-heidelberg.academia.edu/paulyule&lt;/ref&gt; This centres on the excavation of a [[Late Aksumite]] church ruin of the 7th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gaudiello‒P. Yule (eds.), ''Mifsas Baḥri, a Late Aksumite Frontier Community in the Mountains of Tigray, Survey, Excavation and Analysis 2013‒6'', Oxford, BAR International Series S2839, 2017, {{ISBN|978-1-4073-1579-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''philosophy, theology, and fundamental theory of canon law''' are the fields of [[legal philosophy|philosophical]], [[theology (Catholic Church)|theological]] ([[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiological]]), and [[legal theory|legal scholarship]] which concern the place of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] in the nature of the [[Catholic Church]], both as a natural and as a supernatural entity. [[Philosophy]] and theology shape the concepts and self-understanding of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] as the law of both a human organization and as a supernatural entity, since the [[Catholic Church]] believes that [[Jesus Christ]] instituted the church by direct divine command, while the fundamental theory of canon law is a meta-discipline of the "triple relationship between theology, philosophy, and canon law".&lt;ref name=Orsy11&gt;Ladislas Orsy, "Towards a Theological Conception of Canon Law" (published in Jordan Hite, T.O.R., &amp; Daniel J. Ward, O.S.B., "Readings, Cases, Materials in Canon Law: A Textbook for Ministerial Students, Revised Edition" (Collegeville, MN: The Liturgical Press, 1990), pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy of canon law==
{{see also|Philosophy of law}}
A triple species of human [positive] law is distinguished: ecclesiastical or canon law, [[law|civil law]], and the [[jus gentium|law of nations]]. Canon law {jus canonicum} and civil law differ among themselves partly by nature of origin, partly by nature of object, and partly by nature of end:
*They differ in origin: for the origin of the civil power is from God the author of nature; while the origin of the ecclesiastical power is from God the contributor of supernatural grace.
*They differ in object: because canon law regulates spiritual and sacred matters, while civil law regulates matters temporal and political. 
*They differ in end: for canon law especially aims at the eternal happiness {beatitudo} of people; civil law, however, aims at their temporal happiness {felicitas}.&lt;ref&gt;Bargilliat, M., “Prælectiones Juris Canonici—Tomus Primus” (Parisiis: Berche et Tralin, Editores, 1909), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotelian-Thomistic jurisprudence===
{{Main article|Politics (Aristotle)|Treatise on Law|Determinatio}}
[[File:SummaTheologiae.jpg|thumb|right|''Summa theologica'', Pars secunda, prima pars. (copy by Peter Schöffer, 1471)]]
Although canonical jurisprudential theory generally follows the principles of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]-[[Treatise on Law|Thomistic]] [[philosophy of law|legal philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;CanonLaw.info, [http://www.canonlaw.info/ main page]. Accessed 9 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] never explicitly discusses the place of canon law in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]''&lt;ref&gt;J. Budziszewski, [http://www.undergroundthomist.org/the-architecture-of-law-according-to-thomas-aquinas The Architecture of Law According to Thomas Aquinas]; accessed 14 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; (a small section of his ''[[Summa Theologiæ]]''). However, Aquinas himself was influenced by canon law; the fourth clause of his famous 4-part definition of law—the requirement of [[promulgation]]—is taken from the canonists, and the ''sed contra'' of his article on promulgation cites [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] (the "Father of Canon Law") as an authority.&lt;ref&gt;Blackfriars ''Summa Theologiæ'' Vol. 28, pg. 16 [notes by Thomas Gilby O.P. on ''Summa'' Ia-IIæ, q. 90, a. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; According to René A. Wormser,
{{quote|[[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s service in assembling and co-ordinating [sic.] the mass of canon law was of inestimable value; but the man to whom the Church and canon law are most indebted is [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]...And it is largely upon the thesis of St. Thomas Aquinas that the Church jurists went so far as to pronounce that laws were of absolutely no force whatever if they were not for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;René A. Wormser, The Story of the LAW, pp. 187-188&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the term "law" (''lex'') is never explicitly defined in the [[1983 Code of Canon Law|1983 Code]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jgray.org/comps/book1.html JGray.org], accessed June-8-2013&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] cites [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] in defining law as "...an ordinance of reason for the common good, [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgated]] by the one who is in charge of the community"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6X.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §1976], citing ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' I-II, 90, 4&lt;/ref&gt; and reformulates it as "...a rule of conduct enacted by competent authority for the sake of the common good."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6T.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''] §1951&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors, however, dispute the applicability of the [[Treatise on Law|Thomistic definition of law]] (''lex'') to canon law, arguing that its application would impoverish [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiology]] and corrupt the very supernatural end of canon law.&lt;ref&gt;Exegetical Commentary on the Code of Canon Law, Vol. I, pg. 261-262 (commentary on 1983 CIC, Book I, Title I)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jus Publicum Ecclesiasticum''===
With the birth of the omni-competent sovereign nation-state in the seventeenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson &amp; McHenry, ''The American Federal Government'', pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed exclusive jurisdiction over all its citizens, the dual or [[concurrent jurisdiction]] of the Catholic Church and the sovereign state was intellectually and legally challenged. In the new legal and politico-religious climate in the period following the [[Protestant Reformation]], the newly formed [[sovereign state]]s of Europe claimed more jurisdiction over areas of law and legal practice which had traditionally been under the jurisdiction of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory'', pg. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; In this post-Reformation period of political change, [[canon lawyer|canonical jurists]] sought to defend within the categories of the [[public law]] the right of the [[Catholic Church]] to make and enforce [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory'', pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the name, ''jus publicum ecclesiasticum''—"public ecclesiastical law". 

{{quote|The Church is not merely a corporation (''collegium'') or part .of civil society. Hence, the maxim is false, "''Ecclesia est in statu''," or, the Church is placed under the power of the state. The Church is rightly named a Sovereign State. This is proved by Soglia 13 in these words : "''Ex defmitione Pufiendorfii, Status est conjunctio plurium hominum, quae imperio per homines administrate, sibi proprio, et aliunde non dependente, continetur. Atqui ex institutione Christi, Ecclesia est conjunctio hominum, quae per homines, hoc est, per Petrum et Apostolos, eorumque successores administratur cum imperio sibi proprio, nee aliunde dependente ; ergo Ecclesia est Status''."&lt;ref&gt;REV. S. B. SMITH, D.D., [https://archive.org/stream/elementsofeccles01smituoft/elementsofeccles01smituoft_djvu.txt ELEMENTS ECCLESIASTICAL LAW, 9th Edition] (1895), §185&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

The justification of the legal powers of the Catholic Church would now be defended along the lines of the [[sovereign state]]'s justification for its own legal powers, and the Catholic Church would be considered a concurrent and complementary ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'' in the realm of the supernatural end of man to that of the civil [[sovereign state]] in the realm of the natural end of man.&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory'', pg. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Communitas Perfecta''===
{{main article|Communitas Perfecta}}
Many canonists, in the years preceding the [[Second Vatican Council]], considered the justification and basis for canon law being a true legal system to be that the [[Catholic Church]] was established by [[Jesus Christ]] as a ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'', and as such was a true human society which had the right to make human law.

{{quote|“…the Church is a Sovereign State, that is, a perfect and supreme society, established by our Lord for the purpose of leading men to heaven. We say, a society; now what is a society? Speaking in general, it is a number of persons associated together, in order to attain, by united efforts, some common end. We say, perfect; because she is complete of herself, and therefore has within her own bosom all the means sufficient to enable her to attain her end. We say, supreme, because she is subject to no other society on earth. Like every society, the Church is an external organization. For she is composed of human beings, who have a body as well as a soul. She is, in fact, by the will of her divine Founder, a community, an association of men, governed by men. Like every external organization, the Church must be governed by laws and regulations that will enable her to fulfill her mission and attain her end. The aim and end of the Church is the worship of God and the salvation of souls. Any action or omission, therefore, on the part of her members, which hinders her from carrying out her mission or reaching her end, and, consequently, whatever contravenes the regulations made by her concerning the worship of God and the sanctification of her children, is punishable by her. For God, having given her a mission, also gave her the means or the power to fulfill it. Hence she can establish, in fact has established, laws, and regulations, obligatory on her members. If the members violate those laws, they not only sin against God, but they offend also against the order, discipline, laws, or regulations established by the Church.”&lt;ref&gt;REV. S. B. SMITH, D.D., [https://archive.org/stream/elementsecclesia03smituoft/elementsecclesia03smituoft_djvu.txt ELEMENTS OF ECCLESIASTICAL LAW, VOL. III. ECCLESIASTICAL PUNISHMENTS. SECOND, REVISED EDITION.] (New York: Benziger Brothers, 1888), §§1658-1659 (accessed 31 January 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Della Rocca asserts that it is a "fundamental principle of canon law which insists on the right of the Church as a [[Communitas Perfecta|perfect society]],&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In the context of ecclesiological discourse, "perfect society (''societas perfecta'')" and "perfect community (''[[Communitas Perfecta|communitas perfecta]]'')" have the same meaning and are used interchangeably.&lt;/ref&gt; to determine, particularly in the field of legislation, the limits of its own power."&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, ''Manual of Canon Law'', pg. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Pope Benedict XV]], in his [[apostolic constitution]] promulgating the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]], attributes the legislative authority of the church to it being founded by Jesus Christ with all the requirements for a ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XV, ap. const. ''Providentissima Mater Ecclesia'', (found in Peters [trans.], ''1917 Code of Canon Law'', pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology of canon law==
{{see also|Catholic theology|Ecclesiology (Catholic Church)}}
In the decades following the [[Second Vatican Council]], many canonists called for a more theological, rather than philosophical, conception of canon law,&lt;ref name=Fundamental71&gt;Errázuriz, ''Fundamental Theory'', pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging the "triple relationship between theology, philosophy, and canon law".&lt;ref name=Orsy11/&gt;

[[Pope Benedict XVI]], in his address of 21 January 2012 before the [[Roman Rota]], taught that canonical laws can only be [[interpretation (canon law)|interpreted]] and fully understood within the [[Catholic Church]] in the light of her mission and [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiological]] structure.&lt;ref name=Rota2012&gt;Benedict XVI, ''2012 Roman Rota Address'':&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
Were one to tend to identify Canon Law with the system of the laws of the canons, the understanding of that which is juridical in the Church would essentially consist in the comprehending of that which the legal texts establish. At first glance, this approach would appear to hold Human Law entirely in value. However the impoverishment which this conception would bring about becomes manifest: with the practical oblivion of the [[Natural Law]] and of the [[Divine Positive Law]], as well as the vital relationship of every Law with the communion and the mission of the Church, the work of the interpreter becomes deprived of vital contact with ecclesial reality.&lt;ref name=Rota2012/&gt;
}}
Some authors conceive of canon law as ''essentially'' theological and the discipline of canon law as a theological subdiscipline,&lt;ref name=Fundamental71/&gt; but Msgr. Carlos José Errázuriz contends that "in a certain sense, all postconciliar canonical scholarship has shown a theological concern in the widest sense, that is, a tendency to determine more clearly the place of the juridical in the mystery of the Church."&lt;ref name=Fundamental71/&gt;

===Ecclesiological inspiration of the 1983 Code===
{{Main article|1983 Code of Canon Law}}
In view of the decision to reform the existing Code, the [[Second Vatican Council]], in the [[decree (canon law)|decree]] ''[[Optatam totius]]'' (§16), ordered that "the teaching of canon law...should take into account the mystery of the Church, according to the [[apostolic constitution|dogmatic constitution]] ''[[Lumen Gentium|De Ecclesia]]''...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19651028_optatam-totius_en.html ''Optatam totius''] §16, accessed 14 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1917 Code of Canon Law|1917 Code]] was structured according to the [[Roman law]] division of "norms, persons, things, procedures, penalties", while the 1983 Code, in total contrast, was deliberately given a much more doctrinal-theological structure. [[John Paul II]] described the ecclesiological inspiration of the new code of canon law in this way:&lt;ref name=sacrae&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_25011983_sacrae-disciplinae-leges_en.html Sacrae Disciplinae Leges], accessed Jan-11-2013&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
The instrument, which the [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Code]] is, fully corresponds to the [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|nature of the Church]], especially as it is proposed by the teaching of the Second Vatican Council in general, and in a particular way by its [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiological]] teaching. Indeed, in a certain sense, this new Code could be understood as a great effort to translate this same doctrine, that is, the [[Second Vatican Council|conciliar]] ecclesiology, into canonical language. If, however, it is impossible to translate perfectly into [[jurisprudence of canon law|canonical language]] the conciliar image of the Church, nevertheless, in this image there should always be found as far as possible its essential point of reference.&lt;ref name=sacrae/&gt;
}}
Thus the 1983 Code is configured, as far as possible, according to the "mystery of the Church", the most significant divisions—Books II, III, and IV—corresponding to the ''munus regendi'', the ''munus sanctificandi'', and the ''munus docendi'' (the "missions" of governance, of worship/sanctification, and of teaching) which in turn derive from the kingly, the priestly and the prophetic roles or functions of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Confer "CANON LAW AND COMMUNIO

==Fundamental theory of canon law==
{{see also|Ecclesiology (Catholic Church)}}
The fundamental theory of canon law is a discipline covering the basis of canon law in the very nature of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 3&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental theory is a newer discipline that takes as is object "the existence and nature of what is [[justice|juridical]] in the [[Catholic Church|Church of Jesus Christ]]."&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[discipline (academia)|discipline]] seeks to provide a theoretical basis for the coexistence and complementarity of canon law and the [[Catholic Church]], and it seeks to refute the "canonical antijuridicism" (the belief that ''law of the church'' constitutes a contradiction in terms; that ''law'' and ''church'' are radically incompatible)&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; of the various heretical movements and of the [[Protestant Reformation]]&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 7, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand, and on the other, the antijuridicism deriving from a belief that all law is identifiable with the law of the state; that in order to be true law, the state must be its maker.&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline seeks to better explain the nature of law in the church and engages in theological discussions in post-[[Vatican II|conciliar]] Catholicism&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 59 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; and seeks to combat "postconciliar antijuridicism".&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 62&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Putlocker''' refers to an online index of [[File hosting service|hosted files]] and various websites used for [[Streaming media|streaming]] entertainment media, such as films and television series. The initial website originated in the United Kingdom as early as 2011, and grew to receive millions of daily visitors after the shutdown of [[Megaupload]]. In May 2016, the website was blocked in the UK by a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] [[Court order|order]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bolton |first=Doug |date=26 May 2016 |title=Putlocker blocked in the UK by internet service providers after High Court order |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/putlocker-blocked-down-virgin-media-sky-internet-streaming-watch-online-videos-a7050056.html |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at its peak prior to a temporary closure in late 2016, [[Alexa Internet]] listed Putlocker as ranking among the top 250 most-visited websites worldwide.&lt;ref name=ibe /&gt; Putlocker has been reported by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] as a major [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] threat.&lt;ref name=techworm&gt;{{cite news |last=Prabhu |first=Vijay |date=17 October 2016 |title=Yet Another Video Streaming Service Bites The Dust, Putlocker Shuts Down |url=http://www.techworm.net/2016/10/putlocker-video-streaming-service-shuts.html |publisher=TechWorm |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putlocker's [[Top-level domain|domain address]] has changed multiple times throughout its history, with the most recent domain seizure being that of the [[URL]] putlockers.ch, which was suspended and transferred to the ownership of EuroDNS, by order of a Luxembourg court.&lt;ref name=eurodns /&gt; It is not publicly known whether an official Putlocker website maintained by the original team remains available online, but at least fifty [[Mirror website|mirror]] or [[Proxy server|proxy websites]], many of which use the Putlocker name, have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sguru.org/putlocker-proxy/|title=Putlocker Proxy - 50+ Fast Putlocker Mirror &amp; Proxy Sites List|date=11 June 2017|author=Lana Martinez|website=Supportive Guru|access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Launch and popularity===
Putlocker originated in the United Kingdom under the URL putlocker.com. In early January 2012, the website received about 800,000 visitors a day, but after the popular website [[Megaupload]] was shut down due to [[copyright infringement]], Putlocker began receiving approximately 1.6 million visitors a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tung |first=Liam |date=5 April 2012 |title=Hollywood bloodlust cripples another filelocker |url=http://www.itnews.com.au/news/hollywood-bloodlust-cripples-another-filelocker-296099 |publisher=IT News |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The website's operations officer, Adrian Petroff, found Megaupload's closure worrying, stating "who needs [[Stop Online Piracy Act|SOPA]] when a studio exec can make a wish/hit list and sites ‘voluntarily’ shut down?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/were-no-rogue-site-putlocker-responds-to-hollywood-120403/|title=We’re No Rogue Site: PutLocker Responds To Hollywood|date=3 April 2012|author=Enigmax|location=Torrent Freak|access-date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Putlocker was identified by Alfred Perry, vice president for worldwide content protection at [[Paramount Pictures]], as one of the "top 5 rogue cyberlocker services".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandoval |first=Greg |date=31 March 2012 |title=MPAA wants more criminal cases brought against 'rogue' sites |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/mpaa-wants-more-criminal-cases-brought-against-rogue-sites/ |publisher=[[CNET]] |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The website's URL was changed to putlocker.bz, an address which was seized by the [[Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit]] of the UK in June 2014, and was subsequently changed to putlocker.is, a domain located in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harblson |first=Cammy |date=4 June 2014 |title=Is Putlocker.bz Down Or Not Working?

The MPAA revealed that Putlocker operated from Vietnam, and that its servers were hosted by the Swiss company Private Layer.&lt;ref name=techworm /&gt;

In March 2017, it was reported that [[Ted Osius]], then [[United States Ambassador to Vietnam]], held a meeting with Truong Minh Tuan, Vietnam's Minister of Information and Communications, in which Osius urged for the criminal prosecution of Putlocker, along with the websites 123movies and KissCartoon, for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinhdoanh.vnexpress.net/tin-tuc/doanh-nghiep/viet-my-hop-tac-chan-noi-dung-xau-tren-youtube-facebook-3559244.html|title=Việt - Mỹ hợp tác chặn nội dung xấu trên YouTube, Facebook|author=Ngọc Tuyên|date=22 March 2017|website=VnExpress|language=Vietnamese|trans-title=Vietnam - US cooperation to block bad content on YouTube, Facebook|access-date=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/us-ambassador-asks-vietnam-to-target-123movies-putlocker-and-kisscartoon-170323/|title=US Ambassador Asks Vietnam to Target 123movies, Putlocker and Kisscartoon|author=Ernesto|date=23 March 2017|website=TorrentFreak|access-date=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Reichstag''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁaɪçstaːk|lang|De-Reichstag-pronunciation.ogg}}, '''Diet of the Realm'''&lt;ref&gt;Moonis Raza, ''Geographical Dictionary of the World in the Early 20th Century with Pronouncing Gazetteer'' (New Delhi, India: Concept Publishing Company, 1990, two vols), p. 712.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Imperial Diet''') was the [[Parliament]] of [[German Empire|Germany]] from 1871 to 1918. Legislation was shared between the ''Reichstag'' and the ''[[Bundesrat (German Empire)|Bundesrat]]'', which was the Imperial Council of the reigning princes of the German States.

The ''Reichstag'' had no formal right to appoint or dismiss governments, but by contemporary standards it was considered a highly modern and progressive parliament. All German men over 25 years of age were eligible to vote, and members of the ''Reichstag'' were elected by general, universal and [[secret suffrage]]. Members were elected in single-member constituencies by majority vote. If no candidate received a majority of the votes, a runoff election took place. In 1871, the ''Reichstag'' consisted of 382 [[Members of Parliament|members]], but from 1874 it was enlarged to 397 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/kulturundgeschichte/geschichte/parlamentarismus/kaiserreich/index.html Deutscher Bundestag: Kaiserreich (1871 - 1918)] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term of office was initially set at three years, and in 1888 this was extended to five years. The ''Reichstag'' was opened once a year by the Emperor. In order to [[dissolve parliament]], the approval of the Imperial Council and the emperor were required. Members of parliament enjoyed [[legal immunity]] and [[Speech or Debate Clause|indemnity]].

{{Main|Reichstag (building)}}

The ''Reichstag'' first met in the [[Preußischer Landtag|Prussian ''Landtag]] (Parliament) building in [[Berlin]]. From 16 October 1871 until 04 November 1894 it met in a former porcelain factory at number 4, ''Leipziger Straße''. That 23-year "temporary" location was the scene of passionate political debates that are associated with names like Bebel, Liebknecht, and Bismarck. The premises were generally considered too small, so in 1871 a decision was made to construct a new building. In 1872, there was an architectural competition which attracted 103 entries by architects. However, work did not start for some years, due to problems with purchasing land and to disagreements between Emperor [[Wilhelm I]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], and members of the ''Reichstag'', about how the construction should be carried out.

[[File:Reichstagsgebaeude.jpg|thumb|The new Reichstag building in 1894]]
Ten years on, in 1882, another architectural competition was announced, this time with some 200 architects participating. The winner of the second competition was the Frankfurt architect [[Paul Wallot]], who would eventually see his plan executed. On 29 June 1884, the building's foundation stone was finally laid by the Emperor. The new building was acclaimed for its cupola of steel and glass, an engineering masterpiece of the time. In 1888, before it was completed, Emperor Wilhelm I died, and 1888 was the [[Year of Three Emperors]]. The third of these, [[Wilhelm II]], objected to a much greater extent to the very concept of parliament as a democratic institution. The new building opened in 1894. The famous inscription – DEM DEUTSCHEN VOLKE (to the German People) – was added in 1916 by Peter Behrens, and it still towers above the monumental entrance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/visits/kupp.html www.reichstag.de "The Reichstag Building"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9442">{{Admiralty law}}'''Ship registration''' is the process by which a ship is documented and given the nationality of the country to which the ship has been documented. The nationality allows a ship to travel internationally as it is proof of ownership of the vessel.&lt;ref name="A Guide to Ship Registration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/Publications-and-forms/Commercial-operations/Ship-registration/A-guide-to-Ship-Registration.pdf |title=A Guide to Ship Registration |publisher=Maritime New Zealand |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International law requires that every merchant ship be registered in a country, called its [[flag state]].&lt;ref name="icftu7"&gt;ICFTU et al., 2002, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; A ship is subject to the law of its flag state.&lt;ref name="A Guide to Ship Registration"/&gt; It is usual to say that the ship sails under the [[Maritime flag|flag]] of the country of registration.

A ship's flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship's equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents.  The organization which actually registers the ship is known as its registry.  Registries may be governmental or private agencies.  In some cases, such as the United States' Alternative Compliance Program, the registry can assign a third party to administer inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/acp/ |title=U.S. Coast Guard Alternative Compliance Program |publisher=United States Coast Guard |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A register that is open only to ships of its own nation is known as a ''traditional'' or ''national register''.  Registers that are open to foreign-owned ships are known as ''open registries'' and are sometimes called [[flag of convenience|flags of convenience]].

== History ==
Ship registration has been done since business on the seas has been important.  Originally meant to control ships carrying cargo in European seaborne countries,&lt;ref name="A Guide to Ship Registration"/&gt; it was used to make sure ships were being built in the local country, with crews predominantly of the local country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/merchant-shipping-registration-1786-1994.htm |title=Registration of merchant ships |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, ship registration has been used to document ships for ownership. Documentation provides definite evidence of nationality for international purposes and provides financing opportunities with the availability of preferred mortgages on documented vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/nvdc/nvdcfaq.asp |title=USCG National Vessel Documentation Center, FAQ Page |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Requirements for registration ==
Vessels that operate internationally or cross international borders are required to be registered. Some jurisdictions also require vessels that only operate in territorial waters to register on their national register, and some forbid foreign-flagged vessels from trading between ports within the country (a practice known as [[cabotage]]). The country of registration is a ship's flag state and determines its nationality as well as which country's laws govern its operation and the behavior of its crew.&lt;ref name="A Guide to Ship Registration"/&gt;

Each registry has its own rules as to the types of vessels that it will accept for registration. The Liberian Registry, for example, registers seagoing vessels of more than 500 net tons that conduct foreign trade. Vessels over the age of 20 require a waiver as well as the vessel's [[classification society]] being willing to issue [[statutory certificates]] to the vessel. Vessels 15 years or older must have a Status Report of the vessel's Special Survey to be reviewed by Marine Safety.&lt;ref name="Question Listing for Vessel Registration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liscr.com/liscr/Maritime/MaritimeFAQ/VesselRegistration/tabid/109/Default.aspx#270 |title=Question Listing for Vessel Registration |publisher=LISCR |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registries charge a registration fee and annual fees.

== Link to flag state ==
There must be a "genuine link" between a vessel and its flag state. Article 5(1) of the [[Geneva Convention on the High Seas]] of 1958, which came into effect in 1962, requires that "the state must effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and social matters over ships flying its flag."&lt;ref name="dandrea2"&gt;D'Andrea 2006, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 63 states party to that Convention. The principle was repeated in Article 91 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] of 1982 (UNCLOS), which came into effect in 1994.&lt;ref name="icftu7"/&gt; That Convention has 167 parties.

In 1986, the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] attempted to solidify the genuine link concept in the [[United Nations Convention on Conditions for Registration of Ships]].&lt;ref name="dandrea6"&gt;D'Andrea 2006, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Convention on Conditions for Registration of Ships would require that a flag state be linked to its ships either by having an economic stake in the ownership of its ships or by providing mariners to crew the ships.&lt;ref name="dandrea6"/&gt;  To come into force, the 1986 treaty requires 40 signatories whose combined tonnage exceeds 25% of the world total.&lt;ref name="dandrea6"/&gt;  To date, only 14 countries have signed the treaty.&lt;ref name="dandrea6"/&gt;

National or closed registries typically require that a ship be owned and constructed by national interests, and at least partially crewed by its citizens.  Open registries do not have such requirements; some offer on-line registration, sometimes guaranteeing completion in less than a day.&lt;ref name="neff07"&gt;Neff, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unflagged vessels ===
Ships operated illegally, such as by [[pirate]]s, or [[narco submarine]]s, are not normally registered by the operators (although a registered ship may be captured or used covertly for illegal purposes).

A '''shoulder tap''' is an act in which a minor asks an adult to purchase [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] for him or her. Typically, the minor will walk around a [[convenience store]] and solicit help from a passing adult stranger. This is also commonly known as a "Hey Mister".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

A [[Los Angeles Police Department]] survey indicated that almost half of minors who attempt to acquire alcohol use this 
method.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.ca.gov/forms/ABC509.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Such communities use [[sting operation]]s to deter adult assistance and promote awareness of the legal consequences of helping [[underage drinking|minors obtain alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.ca.gov/forms/ABC511.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2001, a [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD) chapter conducted a small unscientific study in [[Massachusetts]], in which teens stood in front of 15 stores and asked 100 adults apparently over the age of 21 to buy them alcohol. Eighty-three of the 100 adults refused and 17 agreed.&lt;ref&gt;"MADD sting shows it's easy for minors to get booze", ''[[Boston Herald]]'', May 23, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Scotland the practice in commonly referred to as a "jump-in".

The orders were issued following [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]. They were intended to address the immediate problem of dealing with the tens of thousands of black refugees who had joined Sherman's march in search of protection and sustenance, and "to assure the harmony of action in the area of operations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA252324&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf "HARMONY OF ACTION" - SHERMAN AS AN ARMY GROUP COMMANDER]&lt;/ref&gt; His intention was for the order to be a temporary measure to address an immediate problem, and not to grant permanent ownership of the land to the freedmen, although most of the recipients assumed otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution'', Harper and Row, 1988, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; General Sherman issued his orders four days after [http://www.freedmen.umd.edu/savmtg.htm meeting] in [[Savannah, Georgia]] with twenty local black ministers and lay leaders and with [[U.S. Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]. Brig. Gen. [[Rufus Saxton]], an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] from [[Massachusetts]] who had previously organized the recruitment of black soldiers for the [[Union Army]], was put in charge of implementing the orders.&lt;ref&gt;Buescher, John. "[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24170 Forty Acres and a Mule]." [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Accessed 12 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The orders had little concrete effect, as they were revoked in the fall of that same year by President [[Andrew Johnson]], who succeeded [[Abraham Lincoln]] after his assassination.

Although mules are not mentioned in the orders, they were a main source for the expression "[[forty acres and a mule]]".  A historical marker commerating the order is in Savannah, near the corner of Harris and Bull streets, in [[Squares of Savannah, Georgia#Madison Square|Madison Square]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savannahtribune.com/articles/historical-marker-unveiled-commemorating-special-field-order-15/ Savannah Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orders==
{{Quotation|Special Field Orders No. 15.
Headquarters  Military Division of the Mississippi,&lt;br&gt;
In the Field, Savannah, Ga., January 16, 1865.

I. The islands from Charleston south, the abandoned rice-fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the Saint Johns River, Fla., are reserved and set apart for the settlement of the BLACKS now made free by the acts of war and the proclamation of the President of the United States.

II. At Beaufort, Hilton Head, Savannah, Fernandina, Saint Augustine, and Jacksonville the blacks may remain in their chosen or accustomed vocations; but on the islands, and in the settlements hereafter to be established, no white person whatever, unless military officers and soldiers detailed for duty, will be permitted to reside; and the sole and exclusive management of affairs will be left to the freed people themselves, subject only to the United States military authority and the acts of Congress. By the laws of war and orders of the President of the United States the negro is free, and must be dealt with as such. He cannot be subjected to conscription or forced military service, save by the written orders of the highest military authority of the Department, under such regulations as the President or Congress may prescribe; domestic servants, blacksmiths, carpenters, and other mechanics will be free to select their own work and residence, but the young and able-bodied negroes must be encouraged to enlist as soldiers in the service of the United States, to contribute their share toward maintaining their own freedom and securing their rights as citizens of the United States. Negroes so enlisted will be organized into companies, battalions, and regiments, under the orders of the United States military authorities, and will be paid, fed, and clothed according to law. The bounties paid on enlistment may, with the consent of the recruit, go to assist his family and settlement in procuring agricultural implements, seed, tools, boats, clothing, and other articles necessary for their livelihood.

III. Whenever three respectable negroes, heads of families, shall desire to settle on land, and shall have selected for that purpose an island, or a locality clearly defined within the limits above designated, the inspector of settlements and plantations will himself, or by such sub-ordinate officer as he may appoint, give them a license to settle such island or district, and afford them such assistance as he can to enable them to establish a peaceable agricultural settlement. The three parties named will subdivide the land, under the supervision of the inspector, among themselves and such others as may choose to settle near them, so that each family shall have a plot of not more than forty acres of tillable ground, and when it borders on some water channel with not more than 800 feet water front, in the possession of which land the military authorities will afford them protection until such time as they can protect themselves or until Congress shall regulate their title. The quartermaster may, on the requisition of the inspector of settlements and plantations, place at the disposal of the inspector one or more of the captured steamers to ply between the settlements and one or more of the commercial points, heretofore named in orders, to afford the settlers the opportunity to supply their necessary wants and to sell the products of their land and labor.

IV. Whenever a negro has enlisted in the military service of the United States he may locate his family in any one of the settlements at pleasure and acquire a homestead and all other rights and privileges of a settler as though present in person. In like manner negroes may settle their families and engage on board the gunboats, or in fishing, or in the navigation of the inland waters, without losing any claim to land or other advantages derived from this system. But no one, unless an actual settler as above defined, or unless absent on Government service, will be entitled to claim any right to land or property in any settlement by virtue of these orders.

V. In order to carry out this system of settlement a general officer will be detailed as inspector of settlements and plantations, whose duty it shall be to visit the settlements, to regulate their police and general management, and who will furnish personally to each head of a family, subject to the approval of the President of the United States, a possessory title in writing, giving as near as possible the description of boundaries, and who shall adjust all claims or conflicts that may arise under the same, subject to the like approval, treating such titles altogether as possessory. The same general officer will also be charged with the enlistment and organization of the negro recruits and protecting their interests while absent from their settlements, and will be governed by the rules and regulations prescribed by the War Department for such purpose.

VI. Brig. Gen. R. Saxton is hereby appointed inspector of settlements and plantations and will at once enter on the performance of his duties. No change is intended or desired in the settlement now on Beaufort Island, nor will any rights to property heretofore acquired be affected thereby.

By order of Maj. Gen. W. T. Sherman:

L. N. DAYTON, Assistant Adjutant-General.
 |William T. Sherman|Military Division of the Mississippi; 1865 series - Special Field Order 15, January 16, 1865.&lt;ref name=Order /&gt;}}

The '''Stamp Act of 1765''' (short title ''Duties in American Colonies Act 1765''; 5 George III, c. 12) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain that imposed a direct tax on the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Morgan pg. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Stamp Act of 1765&amp;nbsp;– A Serendipitous Find" by Hermann Ivester in ''The Revenue Journal'', The [[Revenue Society]], Vol.XX, No.3, December 2009, pp.87–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Printed materials included legal documents, magazines, playing cards, newspapers, and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies.  Like previous taxes, the stamp tax had to be paid in valid British currency, not in colonial paper money.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, S.G. "The American Revolution: A History." Modern Library. 2002, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The purpose of the tax was to pay for British military troops stationed in the American colonies after the [[French and Indian War]], which was the North American theater of the [[Seven Years' War]]. However, the colonists had never feared a French invasion to begin with, and they contended that they had already paid their share of the war expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Doctor Benjamin Franklin, before an August Assembly of the British House of Commons, relating to the Repeal of the Stamp-Act, &amp;c., 1766.&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggested that it was actually a matter of British patronage to surplus British officers and career soldiers who should be paid by London.

The Stamp Act was very unpopular among colonists. A majority considered it a violation of their rights as Englishmen to be taxed without their consent—consent that only the colonial legislatures could grant. Their slogan was "[[No taxation without representation]]." Colonial assemblies sent petitions and protests, and the [[Stamp Act Congress]] held in New York City was the first significant joint colonial response to any British measure when it petitioned Parliament and the King.

One member of the British Parliament argued that the colonials were no different from the 90% residents of Great Britain who did not own property and thus could not vote, but who were nevertheless "virtually" represented by land-owning electors and representatives who had common interests with them.&lt;ref&gt;Soames Jennys, The Objections to the Taxation of Our American Colonies by the Legislature of Great Britain, Briefly Considered (1765).&lt;/ref&gt;  An American attorney refuted this by pointing out that the relations between the Americans and the English electors were "a knot too infirm to be relied on" for proper representation, "virtual" or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dulaney, Considerations on the Propriety of Imposing Taxes in the British Colonies, for the Purpose of Raising a Revenue, by Act of Parliament (1765)(reprinted in The American Revolution, Interpreting Primary Documents 47-51 (Carey 2004)).&lt;/ref&gt; Local protest groups established [[Committees of Correspondence]] which created a loose coalition from New England to Maryland.  Protests and demonstrations increased, often initiated by the [[Sons of Liberty]] and occasionally involving hanging of effigies.  Very soon, all stamp tax distributors were intimidated into resigning their commissions, and the tax was never effectively collected.&lt;ref&gt;Draper pp. 216–223. Nash pp. 44–56. Maier pp. 76–106&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the Stamp Act was not limited to the colonies. British merchants and manufacturers pressured Parliament because their exports to the colonies were threatened by boycotts. The Act was repealed on 18 March 1766 as a matter of expedience, but Parliament affirmed its power to legislate for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever" by also passing the [[Declaratory Act]]. A series of new taxes and regulations then ensued—likewise opposed by the colonists.

The episode played a major role in defining the grievances that were clearly stated within the text of the ''Indictment of George III'' section of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], enabling the organized colonial resistance that led to the [[American Revolution]] in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff pg. 111–120.  Miller pg. 149–153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LessonPlanet-Garran"&gt;{{cite web | author = Daniella Garran | title =''Steps to the American Revolution'' | publisher = Lesson Planet | date = 2010-07-19 | url = http://www.lessonplanet.com/article/history/steps-to-the-american-revolution | accessdate = 2010-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The British victory in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763), known in America as the [[French and Indian War]], had been won only at a great financial cost. During the war, the British [[Government debt|national debt]] nearly doubled, rising from £72,289,673 in 1755 to almost £129,586,789 by 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Morgan, ''Stamp Act Crisis'', 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Post-war expenses were expected to remain high because the [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Bute]] ministry decided in early 1763 to keep ten thousand British regular soldiers in the American colonies, which would cost about £225,000 per year, equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.225|1763|r=0}}}} million today.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Crucible of War'', 563; Thomas, ''British Politics'', 38; Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary reason for retaining such a large force was that demobilizing the army would put 1,500 officers out of work, many of whom were well-connected in [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Crucible of War'', 561; Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 55.&lt;/ref&gt; This made it politically prudent to retain a large peacetime establishment, but Britons were averse to maintaining a [[standing army]] at home so it was necessary to garrison most of the troops elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Crucible of War'', 563.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stationing 10,000 troops to separate American Indians and frontiersmen was one role. The outbreak of [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] in May 1763 apparently reinforced the logic of this decision, as it was an American Indian uprising against the British expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Morgan, ''Stamp Act Crisis'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason to send 10,000 troops deep into the wilderness was to provide billets for the officers who were part of the British patronage system.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Crucible of War'', 560. See also Charles S. Grant, "Pontiac's Rebellion and the British Troop Moves of 1763", ''The Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 40, no. 1 (June 1953), 75–88.&lt;/ref&gt; John Adams said, "Revenue is still demanded from America, and appropriated to the maintenance of swarms of officers and pensioners in idleness and luxury."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Bancroft|title=History of the United States of America, From the Discovery of the Continent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbkTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA292|year=1888|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Grenville.png|left|thumb|right|Prime Minister [[George Grenville]]]]
[[George Grenville]] became prime minister in April 1763 after the failure of the short-lived [[Bute Ministry]], and he had to find a way to pay for this large peacetime army. Raising taxes in Britain was out of the question, since there had been virulent protests in England against the Bute ministry's 1763 [[Cider Bill of 1763|cider tax]], with Bute being hanged in effigy.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Crucible of War'', 510–11; Thomas, ''British Politics'', 6; Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The Grenville ministry therefore decided that Parliament would raise this revenue by taxing the American colonists without their consent. This was something new; Parliament had previously passed measures to regulate trade in the colonies, but it had never before directly taxed the colonies to raise revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''British Politics'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians in London had always expected American colonists to contribute to the cost of their own defense. So long as a French threat existed, there was little trouble convincing colonial legislatures to provide assistance. Such help was normally provided through the raising of colonial militias, which were funded by taxes raised by colonial legislatures. Also, the legislatures were sometimes willing to help maintain regular British units defending the colonies. So long as this sort of help was forthcoming, there was little reason for the British Parliament to impose its own taxes on the colonists. But after the peace of 1763, colonial militias were quickly stood down. Militia officers were tired of the disdain shown to them by regular British officers, and were frustrated by the near-impossibility of obtaining regular British commissions; they were unwilling to remain in service once the war was over. In any case, they had no military role, as the Indian threat was minimal and there was no foreign threat. Colonial legislators saw no need for the British troops.

The [[Sugar Act]] of 1764 was the first tax in Grenville's program to raise a revenue in America, which was a modification of the [[Molasses Act]] of 1733. The Molasses Act had imposed a tax of 6 pence per gallon (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.025|1733|r=2}}}} today) on foreign molasses imported into British colonies. The purpose of the Molasses Act was not actually to raise revenue, but instead to make foreign molasses so expensive that it effectively gave a monopoly to molasses imported from the British West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''British Politics'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not work; colonial merchants avoided the tax by smuggling or, more often, bribing customs officials.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''British Politics'', 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sugar Act reduced the tax to 3 pence per gallon (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.0125|1764|r=2}}}} today) in the hope that the lower rate would increase compliance and thus increase the amount of tax collected.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''British Politics'', 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also taxed additional imports and included measures to make the customs service more effective.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Crucible of War'', 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parliament Stamp Act1765.jpg | right | thumb | Printed copy of the Stamp Act of 1765]]
American colonists initially objected to the [[Sugar Act]] for economic reasons, but before long they recognized that there were constitutional issues involved.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, ''Authority to Tax'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Constitution]] guaranteed that British subjects could not be taxed without their consent, which came in the form of representation in Parliament. The colonists elected no members of Parliament, and so it was seen as a violation of the British Constitution for Parliament to tax them. There was little time to raise this issue in response to the Sugar Act, but it came to be a major objection to the Stamp Act the following year.

==British decision-making==
Parliament announced in April 1764 when the Sugar Act was passed that they would also consider a stamp tax in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Miller pg. 109–113. Morgan and Morgan pg. 75–76. Weslager pg. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition from the colonies was soon forthcoming to this possible tax, but neither members of Parliament nor American agents in Great Britain (such as [[Benjamin Franklin]]) anticipated the intensity of the protest that the tax generated.&lt;ref&gt;Draper 231–233. Middlekauff pg. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stamp act]]s had been a very successful method of taxation within Great Britain; they generated over £100,000 in tax revenue with very little in collection expenses.  By requiring an official stamp on most legal documents, the system was almost self-regulating; a document would be null and void under British law without the required stamp.  Imposition of such a tax on the colonies had been considered twice before the Seven Years' War and once again in 1761.  Grenville had actually been presented with drafts of colonial stamp acts in September and October 1763, but the proposals lacked the specific knowledge of colonial affairs to adequately describe the documents subject to the stamp. At the time of the passage of the Sugar Act in April 1764, Grenville made it clear that the right to tax the colonies was not in question, and that additional taxes might follow, including a stamp tax.&lt;ref&gt;Miller pg. 109–113.  Morgan and Morgan pg. 75–76.  Weslager pg. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Glorious Revolution]] had established the principle of parliamentary supremacy.  Control of colonial trade and manufactures extended this principle across the ocean. This belief had never been tested on the issue of colonial taxation, but the British assumed that the interests of the thirteen colonies were so disparate that a joint colonial action was unlikely to occur against such a tax–an assumption that had its genesis in the failure of the [[Albany Congress|Albany Conference]] in 1754.  By the end of December 1764, the first warnings of serious colonial opposition were provided by pamphlets and petitions from the colonies protesting both the Sugar Act and the proposed stamp tax.&lt;ref&gt;Draper pg. 216, 230–233&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benjamin Franklin by Joseph Siffrein Duplessis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benjamin Franklin]] represented Pennsylvania in discussions about the act]]

For Grenville, the first issue was the amount of the tax.  Soon after his announcement of the possibility of a tax, he had told American agents that he was not opposed to the Americans suggesting an alternative way of raising the money themselves. However, the only other alternative would be to requisition each colony and allow them to determine how to raise their share.  This had never worked before, even during the French and Indian War, and there was no political mechanism in place that would have ensured the success of such cooperation. On 2 February 1765, Grenville met to discuss the tax with [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Jared Ingersoll, Sr.|Jared Ingersoll]] from New Haven, [[Richard Jackson (colonial agent)|Richard Jackson]], agent for Connecticut, and [[Charles Garth]], the agent for South Carolina (Jackson and Garth were also members of Parliament).  These colonial representatives had no specific alternative to present; they simply suggested that the determination be left to the colonies.  Grenville replied that he wanted to raise the money "by means the most easy and least objectionable to the Colonies". Thomas Whately had drafted the Stamp Act, and he said that the delay in implementation had been "out of Tenderness to the colonies", and that the tax was judged as "the easiest, the most equal and the most certain."&lt;ref&gt;Draper 231–233.  Middlekauff pg. 77.  Ingersoll accepted a position of stamp distributor for Connecticut despite his opposition. Middlekauff pg. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate in Parliament began soon after this meeting.  Petitions submitted by the colonies were officially ignored by Parliament. In the debate, Charles Townshend said, "and now will these Americans, children planted by our care, nourished up by our Indulgence until they are grown to a degree of strength and opulence, and protected by our arms, will they grudge to contribute their mite to relieve us from heavy weight of the burden which we lie under?"&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff  pg. 78–80&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to Colonel [[Isaac Barré]]’s response:

{{quote|They planted by your care? No! Your oppression planted ‘em in America. They fled from your tyranny to a then uncultivated and unhospitable country where they exposed themselves to almost all the hardships to which human nature is liable, and among others to the cruelties of a savage foe, the most subtle, and I take upon me to say, the most formidable of any people upon the face of God’s earth....

They nourished by your indulgence? They grew by your neglect of ‘em. As soon as you began to care about ‘em, that care was exercised in sending persons to rule over 'em, in one department and another, who were perhaps the deputies of deputies to some member of this house, sent to spy out their liberty, to misrepresent their actions and to prey upon 'em; men whose behaviour on many occasions has caused the blood of those sons of liberty to recoil within them....

They protected by your arms? They have nobly taken up arms in your defence, have exerted a valour amidst their constant and laborious industry for the defence of a country whose frontier while drenched in blood, its interior parts have yielded all its little savings to your emolument&amp;nbsp;.... The people I believe are as truly loyal as any subjects the king has, but a people jealous of their liberties and who will vindicate them if ever they should be violated; but the subject is too delicate and I will say no more."&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff pg. 79&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Massachusetts Royal Governor [[William Shirley]] assured London in 1755 that American independence could easily be defeated by force. He argued:
:At all Events, they could not maintain such an Independency, without a Strong Naval Force, which it must forever be in the Power of Great Britain to hinder them from having: And whilst His Majesty hath 7000 Troops kept up within them, &amp; in the Great Lakes upon the back of six of them, with the Indians at Command, it seems very easy, provided the Governors &amp; principal Civil Officers are Independent of the Assemblies for their Subsistence, &amp; commonly Vigilant, to prevent any Steps of that kind from being taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Louis Beer|title=British Colonial Policy, 1754-1765|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qg8LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA266|year=1907|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Details of tax===
[[File:Proof sheet of one penny stamps Stamp Act 1765.jpg|thumb|[[Galley proof|Proof]] sheet of one-penny stamps submitted for approval to Commissioners of Stamps by engraver, May 10, 1765]]

The Stamp Act was passed by Parliament on 22 March 1765 with an effective date of 1 November 1765. It passed 205–49 in the House of Commons and unanimously in the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Weslager pg. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians Edmund and Helen Morgan describe the specifics of the tax:

{{quote|The highest tax, £10, was placed ... on attorney licenses.  Other papers relating to court proceedings were taxed in amounts varying from 3d. to 10s.  Land grants under a hundred acres were taxed 1s. 6d., between 100 and 200 acres 2s., and from 200 to 320 acres 2s. 6d., with an additional 2s 6d. for every additional {{convert|320|acre|km2}}.  Cards were taxed a shilling a pack, dice ten shillings, and newspapers and pamphlets at the rate  of a penny for a single sheet and a shilling for every sheet in pamphlets or papers totaling more than one sheet and fewer than six sheets in octavo, fewer than twelve in quarto, or fewer than twenty in folio (in other words, the tax on pamphlets grew in proportion to their size but ceased altogether if they became large enough to qualify as a book).&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Morgan pg. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The high taxes on lawyers and college students were designed to limit the growth of a professional class in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed]]'' (1989) p 825&lt;/ref&gt; The stamps had to be purchased with [[coin|hard currency]], which was scarce, rather than the more plentiful colonial paper currency. To avoid draining currency out of the colonies, the revenues were to be expended in America, especially for supplies and salaries of British Army units who were stationed there.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Morgan pg. 96–97.  Weslager (pg. 42) also notes that the paper used had to be pre-stamped in England.  Most paper came from there anyway, so there were "approximately fifty colonial papermakers who operated their own mills" who would suffer from decreased demand for their products.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two features of the Stamp Act involving the courts attracted special attention.  The tax on court documents specifically included courts "exercising ecclesiastical jurisdiction." These type of courts did not currently exist in the colonies and no bishops were currently assigned to the colonies, who would preside over the courts.  Many colonists or their ancestors had fled England specifically to escape the influence and power of such state-sanctioned religious institutions, and they feared that this was the first step to reinstating the old ways in the colonies.  Some Anglicans in the northern colonies were already openly advocating the appointment of such bishops, but they were opposed by both southern Anglicans and the non-Anglicans  who made up the majority in the northern colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Morgan pg. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stamp Act allowed admiralty courts to have jurisdiction for trying violators, following the example established by the Sugar Act.  However, admiralty courts had traditionally been limited to cases involving the high seas.  The Sugar Act seemed to fall within this precedent, but the Stamp Act did not, and the colonists saw this as a further attempt to replace their local courts with courts controlled by England.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Morgan pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial reaction==

===Political responses===
Grenville started appointing Stamp Distributors almost immediately after the Act passed Parliament.  Applicants were not hard to come by because of the anticipated income that the positions promised, and he appointed local colonists to the post.  Benjamin Franklin even suggested the appointment of [[John Hughes (Pennsylvania politician)|John Hughes]] as the agent for Pennsylvania, indicating that even Franklin was not aware of the turmoil and impact that the tax was going to generate on American-British relations or that these distributors would become the focus of colonial resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Draper pg. 223.  Weslager pg. 51–52.  Separate appointments were made for the three Canadian colonies ([[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]]), one each for [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]], and five for the islands of the West Indies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate in the colonies had actually begun in the spring of 1764 over the Stamp Act when Parliament passed a resolution that contained the assertion, "That, towards further defraying the said Expences, it may be proper to charge certain Stamp Duties in the said Colonies and Plantations."  Both the [[Sugar Act]] and the proposed Stamp Act were designed principally to raise revenue from the colonists.  The Sugar Act, to a large extent, was a continuation of past legislation related primarily to the regulation of trade (termed an external tax), but its stated purpose was entirely new: to collect revenue directly from the colonists for a specific purpose.  The novelty of the Stamp Act was that it was the first internal tax (a tax based entirely on activities within the colonies) levied directly on the colonies by Parliament. It was judged by the colonists to be a more dangerous assault on their rights than the Sugar Act was, because of its potential wide application to the colonial economy.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan pg. 311–313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical issue that soon held center stage was the matter of [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]]. Benjamin Franklin had raised this as far back as 1754 at the Albany Congress when he wrote, "That it is suppos’d an undoubted Right of Englishmen not to be taxed but by their own Consent given thro’ their Representatives. That the Colonies have no Representatives in Parliament."&lt;ref&gt;Draper pg. 216&lt;/ref&gt;  The counter to this argument was the theory of [[virtual representation]]. [[Thomas Whately]] enunciated this theory in a pamphlet that readily acknowledged that there could be no taxation without consent, but the facts were that at least 75% of British adult males were not represented in Parliament because of property qualifications or other factors.  Members of Parliament were bound to represent the interests of all British citizens and subjects, so colonists were the recipients of virtual representation in Parliament, like those disenfranchised subjects in the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (1956) pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory, however, ignored a crucial difference between the unrepresented in Britain and the colonists.  The colonists enjoyed actual representation in their own legislative assemblies, and the issue was whether these legislatures, rather than Parliament, were in fact the sole recipients of the colonists' consent with regard to taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Draper pg. 216–217&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J S Copley - Samuel Adams.jpg|thumb|[[Samuel Adams]] opposed the act]]
In May 1764, [[Samuel Adams]] of Boston drafted the following that stated the common American position:

{{quote|For if our Trade may be taxed why not our Lands?  Why not the Produce of our Lands &amp; every thing we possess or make use of?  This we apprehend annihilates our Charter Right to govern &amp; tax ourselves&amp;nbsp;– It strikes our British Privileges, which as we have never forfeited them, we hold in common with our Fellow Subjects who are Natives of Britain: If Taxes are laid upon us in any shape without our having a legal Representation where they are laid, are we not reduced from the Character of free Subjects to the miserable State of tributary Slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Draper pg. 219&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Massachusetts appointed a five-member [[Committee of Correspondence]] in June 1764 to coordinate action and exchange information regarding the Sugar Act, and Rhode Island formed a similar committee in October 1764.  This attempt at unified action represented a significant step forward in colonial unity and cooperation. The Virginia House of Burgesses sent a protest of the taxes to London in December 1764, arguing that they did not have the specie required to pay the tax.&lt;ref&gt;Weslager pg.58–59. Ferling pg 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Connecticut also sent protest to England in 1764.  The content of the messages varied, but they all emphasized that taxation of the colonies without colonial assent was a violation of their rights.  By the end of 1765, all of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] except Georgia and North Carolina had sent some sort of protest passed by colonial legislative assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan pg. 314–315.  Draper pg. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[House of Burgesses|Virginia House of Burgesses]] reconvened in early May 1765 after news was received of the passage of the Act. By the end of May, it appeared that they would not consider the tax, and many legislators went home, including [[George Washington]]. Only 30 out of 116 Burgesses remained, but one of those remaining was [[Patrick Henry]] who was attending his first session.  Henry led the opposition to the Stamp Act; he proposed his resolutions on 30 May 1765, and they were passed in the form of the [[Virginia Resolves]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferling pg. 32–34.  Middlekauff pg. 83&lt;/ref&gt;  The Resolves stated:

{{quote|Resolved, That the first Adventurers and Settlers of this his majesty's colony and Dominion of Virginia brought with them, and transmitted to their Posterity, and all other his Majesty's subjects since inhabiting in this his Majesty's said Colony, all the Liberties, privileges, Franchises, and Immunities that have at any Time been held, enjoyed, and possessed, by the People of Great Britain.

Resolved, That by the two royal Charters, granted by King James the First, the Colonists aforesaid are declared entitled to all Liberties, Privileges, and Immunities of Denizens and natural Subjects, to all Intents and Purposes, as if they had been abiding and born within the Realm of England.

Resolved, That the Taxation of the People by themselves, or by Persons chosen by themselves to represent them, who could only know what Taxes the People are able to bear, or the easiest method of raising them, and must themselves be affected by every Tax laid on the People, is the only Security against a burdensome Taxation, and the distinguishing characteristick of British Freedom, without which the ancient Constitution cannot exist.

Resolved, That his majesty's liege people of this his most ancient and loyal Colony have without interruption enjoyed the inestimable Right of being governed by such Laws, respecting their internal Polity and Taxation, as are derived from their own Consent, with the Approbation of their Sovereign, or his Substitute; and that the same hath never been forfeited or yielded up, but hath been constantly recognized by the King and People of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff pg. 84. The Resolves were widely reprinted and many versions of them are still seen.  Middlekauff used the wording from the journal of the House of Burgesses.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 6 June 1765, the Massachusetts Lower House proposed a meeting for the 1st Tuesday of October in New York City:

{{quote|That it is highly expedient there should be a Meeting as soon as may be, of Committees from the Houses of Representatives or Burgesses in the several Colonies on this Continent to consult together on the present Circumstances of the Colonies, and the difficulties to which they are and must be reduced by the operation of the late Acts of Parliament for levying Duties and Taxes on the Colonies, and to consider of a general and humble Address to his Majesty and the Parliament to implore Relief.&lt;ref&gt;Weslager pg. 60&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There was no attempt to keep this meeting a secret; Massachusetts promptly notified [[Richard Jackson (colonial agent)|Richard Jackson]] of the proposed meeting, their agent in England and a member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Weslager pg. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests in the streets===

}}

While the colonial legislatures were acting, the ordinary citizens of the colonies were also voicing their concerns outside of this formal political process.  Historian Gary B. Nash wrote:

{{quote|Whether stimulated externally or ignited internally, ferment during the years  from 1761 to 1766 changed the dynamics of social and political relations in the colonies and set in motion currents of reformist sentiment with the force of a mountain wind.  Critical to this half decade was the colonial response to England’s Stamp Act, more the reaction of common colonists than that of their presumed leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Nash p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Both loyal supporters of English authority and well-established colonial protest leaders underestimated the self-activating capacity of ordinary colonists.  By the end of 1765 ... people in the streets had astounded, dismayed, and frightened their social superiors.&lt;ref&gt;Nash p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Massachusetts====
Early street protests were most notable in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. [[Andrew Oliver]] was a distributor of stamps for Massachusetts who was hanged in effigy on 14 August 1765 "from a giant elm tree at the crossing of Essex and Orange Streets in the city’s South End."  Also hung was a [[jackboot]] painted green on the bottom ("a Green-ville sole"), a pun on both Grenville and the Earl of Bute, the two people most blamed by the colonists.&lt;ref&gt;Nash p.  48&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] ordered sheriff Stephen Greenleaf to take down the effigy, but he was opposed by a large crowd.  All day the crowd detoured merchants on Orange Street to have their goods symbolically stamped under the elm tree, which later became known as the "[[Liberty Tree]]".

Ebenezer MacIntosh was a veteran of the Seven Years' War and a shoemaker. One night, he led a crowd which cut down the effigy of Andrew Oliver and took it in a funeral procession to the Town House where the legislature met.  From there, they went to Oliver's office—which they tore down and symbolically stamped the timbers. Next, they took the effigy to Oliver’s home at the foot of Fort Hill, where they beheaded it and then burned it—along with Oliver’s stable house and coach and chaise.  Greenleaf and Hutchinson were stoned when they tried to stop the mob, which then looted and destroyed the contents of Oliver's house.  Oliver asked to be relieved of his duties the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Nash pp. 45–47&lt;/ref&gt; This resignation, however, was not enough.  Oliver was ultimately forced by MacIntosh to be paraded through the streets and to publicly resign under the Liberty Tree.&lt;ref&gt;Nash p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sons of Liberty Broadside, 1765.jpg|thumb|A 1765 [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]] regarding the resignation of [[Andrew Oliver]] under the [[Liberty Tree]]]]

As news spread of the reasons for Andrew Oliver's resignation, violence and threats of aggressive acts increased throughout the colonies, as did organized groups of resistance.  Throughout the colonies, members of the middle and upper classes of society formed the foundation for these groups of resistance and soon called themselves the Sons of Liberty.  These colonial groups of resistance burned effigies of royal officials, forced Stamp Act collectors to resign, and were able to get businessmen and judges to go about without using the proper stamps demanded by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, S.G. "The American Revolution: A History." Modern Library. 2002, pp. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 August, a mob damaged the home and official papers of William Story, the deputy register of the Vice-Admiralty, who then moved to Marblehead, Massachusetts. Benjamin Hallowell, the comptroller of customs, suffered the almost total loss of his home.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass Adair &amp; John A Schultz, eds., Peter Oliver’s Origin and Progress of the American Rebellion: A Tory View (The Huntington Library, 1961), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August, MacIntosh led an attack on Hutchinson's mansion.  The mob evicted the family, destroyed the furniture, tore down the interior walls, emptied the wine cellar, scattered Hutchinson's collection of Massachusetts historical papers, and pulled down the building's cupola.  Hutchinson had been in public office for three decades; he estimated his loss at £2,218&lt;ref&gt;Hosmer pg. 91–94&lt;/ref&gt; (in today's money, at nearly $250,000).  Nash concludes that this attack was more than just a reaction to the Stamp Act:

{{quote|But it is clear that the crowd was giving vent to years of resentment at the accumulation of wealth and power by the haughty prerogative faction led by Hutchinson.  Behind every swing of the ax and every hurled stone, behind every shattered crystal goblet and splintered mahogany chair, lay the fury of a plain Bostonian who had read or heard the repeated references to impoverished people as "rable" and to Boston’s popular caucus, led by Samuel Adams, as a "herd of fools, tools, and synchophants."&lt;ref&gt;Nash p.48&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]] offered a £300 reward for information on the leaders of the mob, but no information was forthcoming. MacIntosh and several others were arrested, but were either freed by pressure from the merchants or released by mob action.&lt;ref&gt;Nash pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

The street demonstrations originated from the efforts of respectable public leaders such as [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]], who commanded the ''Boston Gazette'', and Samuel Adams of the "[[Loyal Nine]]" of the [[Boston Caucus]], an organization of Boston merchants. They made efforts to control the people below them on the economic and social scale, but they were often unsuccessful in maintaining a delicate balance between mass demonstrations and riots.  These men needed the support of the working class, but also had to establish the legitimacy of their actions to have their protests to England taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;Nash p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of these protests, the Loyal Nine was more of a social club with political interests but, by December 1765, it began issuing statements as the [[Sons of Liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;Maier p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rhode Island====
Rhode Island also experienced street violence. A crowd built a gallows near the Town House in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] on 27 August, where they carried effigies of three officials appointed as stamp distributors: Augustus Johnson, Dr. Thomas Moffat, and lawyer [[Martin Howard]]. The crowd at first was led by merchants [[William Ellery]], Samuel Vernon, and Robert Crook, but they soon lost control. That night, the crowd was led by a poor man named John Weber, and they attacked the houses of Moffat and Howard, where they destroyed walls, fences, art, furniture, and wine.  The local Sons of Liberty were publicly opposed to violence, and they refused at first to support Weber when he was arrested.  They were persuaded to come to his assistance, however, when retaliation was threatened against their own homes.  Weber was released and faded into obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;Nash pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard became the only prominent American to publicly support the Stamp Act in his pamphlet "A Colonist's Defence of Taxation" (1765). After the riots, Howard had to leave the colony, but he was rewarded by the Crown with an appointment as Chief Justice of North Carolina at a salary of ₤1,000.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins Updike, ''History of the Episcopal church in Narragansett, Rhode Island'' (1847) p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

====New York====
{{Main|Province of New York#Stamp Act}}
In [[New York (state)|New York]], James McEvers resigned his distributorship four days after the attack on Hutchinson's house.  The stamps arrived in New York Harbor on 24 October for several of the northern colonies.  Placards appeared throughout the city warning that "the first man that either distributes or makes use of [[stamped paper]] let him take care of his house, person, and effects."  New York merchants met on 31 October and agreed not to sell any English goods until the Act was repealed.  Crowds took to the streets for four days of demonstrations, uncontrolled by the local leaders, culminating in an attack by two thousand people on Governor [[Cadwallader Colden]]'s home and the burning of two sleighs and a coach. Unrest in [[New York City]] continued through the end of the year, and the local Sons of Liberty had difficulty in controlling crowd actions.&lt;ref&gt;Nash pp. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Colonies====
In Frederick, Maryland, a court of 12 magistrates ruled the Stamp Act invalid on 23 November 1765, and directed that businesses and colonial officials proceed in all matters without use of the stamps.  A week later, a crowd conducted a mock funeral procession for the act in the streets of Frederick.  The magistrates have been dubbed the "12 Immortal Justices," and 23 November has been designated "[[Repudiation Day]]" by the Maryland state legislature.  On 1 October 2015, Senator Cardin (D-MD) read into the Congressional Record a statement noting 2015 as the 250th anniversary of the event.  Among the 12 magistrates was William Luckett, who later served as lieutenant colonel in the Maryland Militia at the battle of Germantown.

Other popular demonstrations occurred in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], [[Annapolis, Maryland]], [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] and [[New Bern, North Carolina]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina]].  In [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], demonstrations were subdued but even targeted Benjamin Franklin's home, although it was not vandalized.&lt;ref&gt;Nash pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; By 16 November, twelve of the stamp distributors had resigned.  The Georgia distributor did not arrive in America until January 1766, but his first and only official action was to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall effect of these protests was to both anger and unite the American people like never before.  Opposition to the Act inspired both political and constitutional forms of literature throughout the colonies, strengthened the colonial political perception and involvement, and created new forms of organized resistance.  These organized groups quickly learned that they could force royal officials to resign by employing violent measures and threats.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, S.G. "The American Revolution: A History."

====Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and the Caribbean====
The main issue was constitutional rights of Englishmen, so the French in Quebec did not react.  Some English-speaking merchants were opposed, but were in a fairly small minority. The ''[[Quebec Gazette]]'' ceased publication until the act was repealed, apparently over the unwillingness to use stamped paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = W.B. | last = Kerr | title = The Stamp Act in Quebec | journal = English Historical Review | date = October 1932 | volume = 47 | number = 188 | pages = 648–651 | jstor = 553075}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In neighboring [[History of Nova Scotia|Nova Scotia]] a number of former New England residents objected, but recent British immigrants and London-oriented business interests based in Halifax, the provincial capital were more influential.  The only major public protest was the hanging in effigy of the stamp distributor and Lord Bute.  The act was implemented in both provinces, but Nova Scotia's stamp distributor resigned in January 1766, beset by ungrounded fears for his safety.  Authorities there were ordered to allow ships bearing unstamped papers to enter its ports, and business continued unabated after the distributors ran out of stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Wilfred B. | last = Kerr | title = The Stamp Act in Nova Scotia | journal = New England Quarterly | date = September 1933 | volume = 6 | number = 3 | pages = 552–566 | jstor = 359557}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act occasioned some protests in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and the drafting of petitions opposing not only the Stamp Act, but the existence of the customhouse at [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], based on legislation dating back to the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] forbidding any sort of duties on the importation of goods related to its fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anspach|first=Lewis Amadeus|title=A History of the Island of Newfoundland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nb4NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA192#v=onepage&amp;f=false|page=192|publisher=self-published|year=1819|location=London|oclc=1654202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violent protests were few in the Caribbean colonies.  Political opposition was expressed in a number of colonies, including [[Barbados]] and [[Antigua]], and by absentee landowners living in Britain.  The worst political violence took place on [[St. Kitts]] and [[Nevis]].  Riots took place on 31 October 1765, and again on 5 November, targeting the homes and offices of stamp distributors; the number of participants suggests that the percentage of St. Kitts' white population involved matched that of Bostonian involvement in its riots.  The delivery of stamps to St. Kitts was successfully blocked, and they were never used there.  [[Montserrat]] and Antigua also succeeded in avoiding the use of stamps; some correspondents thought that rioting was prevented in Antigua only by the large troop presence.  Despite vocal political opposition, Barbados used the stamps, to the pleasure of [[George III of Great Britain|King George]].  In [[Jamaica]] there was also vocal opposition, which included threats of violence.  There was much evasion of the stamps, and ships arriving without stamped papers were allowed to enter port.  Despite this, Jamaica produced more stamp revenue (£2,000) than any other colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Andrew J. | last = O'Shaughnessy | title = The Stamp Act Crisis in the British Caribbean | journal = William and Mary Quarterly | date = Apr 1994 | volume = 51 | number = 2 | pages = 203–26 | jstor = 2946860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sons of Liberty====
{{Main|Sons of Liberty}}

It was during this time of street demonstrations that locally organized groups started to merge into an inter-colonial organization of a type not previously seen in the colonies.  The term "sons of liberty" had been used in a generic fashion well before 1765, but it was only around February 1766 that its influence extended throughout the colonies as an organized group using the formal name "Sons of Liberty", leading to a pattern for future resistance to the British that carried the colonies towards 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Maier pg. 76–82.  Maier noted that the term "sons of liberty", used in the generic sense, was used as early as the 1750s in some Connecticut documents.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian John C. Miller noted that the name was adopted as a result of Barre's use of the term in his February 1765 speech.&lt;ref&gt;Miller pg. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization spread month by month after independent starts in several different colonies. By 6 November, a committee was set up in New York to correspond with other colonies, and in December an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  In January, a correspondence link was established between Boston and Manhattan, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, New Hampshire, and Newport. By March, Sons of Liberty organizations had been established in New Jersey, Maryland, and Norfolk, Virginia, and a local group established in North Carolina was attracting interest in South Carolina and Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;Maiers pg. 78–81&lt;/ref&gt;

The officers and leaders of the Sons of Liberty "were drawn almost entirely from the middle and upper ranks of colonial society," but they recognized the need to expand their power base to include "the whole of political society, involving all of its social or economic subdivisions." To do this, the Sons of Liberty relied on large public demonstrations to expand their base.&lt;ref&gt;Maier pg. 86–88&lt;/ref&gt;  They learned early on that controlling such crowds was problematical, although they strived to control "the possible violence of extra-legal gatherings."  The organization professed its loyalty to both local and British established government, but possible military action as a defensive measure was always part of their considerations.  Throughout the Stamp Act Crisis, the Sons of Liberty professed continued loyalty to the King because they maintained a "fundamental confidence" that Parliament would do the right thing and repeal the tax.&lt;ref&gt;Maier pg. 101–106.  Miller pg. 139. Miller wrote, "Had Great Britain attempted to enforce the Stamp Act, there can be little doubt that British troops and embattled Americans would have shed each other’s blood ten years before Lexington. As Benjamin Franklin remarked, a British army would not have found a rebellion in the American colonies in 1765 but it would have made one."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Colonial newspapers====
[[File:O! the fatal Stamp.jpg | left | thumb|Bradford's Philadelphia paper gave a graphic warning.]]

John Adams complained that the London ministry was intentionally trying "to strip us in a great measure of the means of knowledge, by loading the Press, the colleges, and even an Almanack and a News-Paper, with restraints and duties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard D. Brown|title=The Strength of a People: The Idea of an Informed Citizenry in America, 1650-1870|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D2Ew8TbLAKkC&amp;pg=PA57|year=1997|publisher=Uof North Carolina Press|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press fought back.  By 1760 the fledgling American newspaper industry comprised 24 weekly papers in major cities. Benjamin Franklin had created an informal network  so that each one routinely reprinted news, editorials, letters and essays from the others, thus helping form a common American voice.  All the editors were annoyed at the new stamp tax they would have to pay on each copy. By informing colonists what the other colonies were saying the press became a powerful opposition force to the Stamp Act.  Many circumvented the and most equated taxation without representation with despotism and tyranny, thus providing a common vocabulary of protest for the Thirteen Colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Roger P. Mellen, "The Colonial Virginia Press and the Stamp Act." ''Journalism History'' 38.2 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspapers reported effigy hangings and stamp master resignation speeches. Some newspapers were on the royal payroll and supported the Act, but most of the press was free and vocal. Thus [[William Bradford (American Revolutionary printer)|William Bradford]], the foremost printer in Philadelphia, became a leader of the Sons of Liberty. He added a skull and crossbones with the words, "the fatal Stamp," to the masthead of his ''Pennsylvania Journal and weekly Advertiser''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David A. Copeland|title=Debating the Issues in Colonial Newspapers: Primary Documents on Events of the Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bm6kNpvnnhgC&amp;pg=PA195|year=2000|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest forms of American propaganda appeared in these printings in response to the law. The articles written in colonial newspapers were particularly critical of the act because of the Stamp Act's disproportionate effect on printers. [[David Ramsay (historian)|David Ramsay]], a patriot and historian from South Carolina, wrote of this phenomenon shortly after the American Revolution:

{{Quote|text=It was fortunate for the liberties of America, that newspapers were the subject of a heavy stamp duty. Printers, when influenced by government, have genereally arranged themselves on the side of liberty, nor are they less remarkable for attention to the profits of their profession. A stamp duty, which openly invaded the first, and threatened a great diminution of the last, provoked their united zealous opposition.&lt;ref&gt;"The Colonial Newspapers and the Stamp Act" by Arthur M. Schlesinger in The New England Quarterly, Vol. 8, No. 1 (March 1935), pp. 65&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Most printers were critical of the Stamp Act, although a few Loyalist voices did exist. Some of the more subtle Loyalist sentiments can be seen in publications such as ''The Boston Evening Post'', which was run by British sympathizers John and Thomas Fleet. The article detailed a violent protest that occurred in New York in December, 1765, then described the riot's participants as "imperfect" and labeled the group's ideas as "contrary to the general sense of the people."&lt;ref&gt;Tillman 2013, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; These Loyalists beliefs can be seen in some of the early newspaper articles about the Stamp Act, but the anti-British writings were more prevalent and seem to have had a more powerful effect.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schlesinger, "The Colonial Newspapers and The Stamp Act" ''New England Quarterly'' 8#1 (1935 63-83 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/359430 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many papers assumed a relatively conservative tone before the act went into effect, implying that they might close if it wasn't repealed. However, as time passed and violent demonstrations ensued, the authors became more vitriolic. Several newspaper editors were involved with the Sons of Liberty, such as William Bradford of ''The Pennsylvania Journal'' and Benjamin Edes of ''The Boston Gazette'', and they echoed the group's sentiments in their publications.  The Stamp Act went into effect that November, and many newspapers ran editions with imagery of tombstones and skeletons, emphasizing that their papers were "dead" and would no longer be able to print because of the Stamp Act.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger pg. 74&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of them returned in the upcoming months, defiantly appearing without the stamp of approval that was deemed necessary by the Stamp Act. Printers were greatly relieved when the law was nullified in the following spring, and the repeal asserted their positions as a powerful voice (and compass) for public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, "The Colonial Newspapers and The Stamp Act" p 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stamp Act 1765 - Triumph of America.jpg|thumb|An English newspaper bewails the repeal of the Stamp Act.]]

===Stamp Act Congress===
{{Main|Stamp Act Congress}}
The Stamp Act Congress was held in New York in October 1765.  Twenty-seven delegates from nine colonies were the members of the Congress, and their responsibility was to draft a set of formal petitions stating why Parliament had no right to tax them.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, S.G. "The American Revolution: A History." Modern Library. 2002, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the delegates were many important men in the colonies.  Historian John Miller observes, "The composition of this Stamp Act Congress ought to have been convincing proof to the British government that resistance to parliamentary taxation was by no means confined to the riffraff of colonial seaports."&lt;ref&gt;Miller pg. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

The youngest delegate was 26-year-old [[John Rutledge]] of South Carolina, and the oldest was 65-year-old [[Hendrick Fisher]] of New Jersey.  Ten of the delegates were lawyers, ten were merchants, and seven were planters or land-owning farmers; all had served in some type of elective office, and all but three were born in the colonies.  Four died before the colonies declared independence, and four signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]; nine attended the [[First Continental Congress|first]] and [[Second Continental Congress|second]] Continental Congresses, and three were [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] during the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Weslager pg. 108–111&lt;/ref&gt;

New Hampshire declined to send delegates, and North Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia were not represented because their governors did not call their legislatures into session, thus preventing the selection of delegates.  Despite the composition of the congress, each of the Thirteen Colonies eventually affirmed its decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Miller pg. 137–139.  Morgan and Morgan pg. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the nine colonies represented at the Congress agreed to sign the petitions to the King and Parliament produced by the Congress. The delegations from New York, Connecticut, and South Carolina were prohibited from signing any documents without first receiving approval from the colonial assemblies that had appointed them.&lt;ref&gt;Weslager pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Massachusetts governor Francis Bernard believed that his colony’s delegates to the Congress would be supportive of Parliament.  [[Timothy Ruggles]] in particular was Bernard's man, and was elected chairman of the Congress.  Ruggles' instructions from Bernard were to "recommend submission to the Stamp Act until Parliament could be persuaded to repeal it."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Morgan pg. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt;  Many delegates felt that a final resolution of the Stamp Act would actually bring Britain and the colonies closer together. [[Robert Livingston (1718-1775)|Robert Livingston]] of New York stressed the importance of removing the Stamp Act from the public debate, writing to his colony's  agent in England, "If I really wished to see America in a state of independence I should desire as one of the most effectual means to that end that the stamp act should be enforced."&lt;ref&gt;Weslager pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikisource|Declaration of Rights and Grievances}}
The Congress met for 12 consecutive days, including Sundays.  There was no audience at the meetings, and no information was released about the deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;Weslager pg. 115.  Morgan and Morgan pg. 142&lt;/ref&gt;  The meeting's final product was called "The [[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]]", and was drawn up by delegate [[John Dickinson (politician)|John Dickinson]] of  Pennsylvania. This Declaration raised fourteen points of colonial protest. It asserted that colonists possessed all the [[rights of Englishmen]] in addition to protesting the Stamp Act issue, and that Parliament could not represent the colonists since they had no [[right to vote|voting rights]] over Parliament. Only the colonial assemblies had a right to tax the colonies. They also asserted that the extension of authority of the admiralty courts to non-naval matters represented an abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Morgan pg. 145–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to simply arguing for their rights as Englishmen, the congress also asserted that they had certain natural rights solely because they were human beings.  Resolution 3 stated, "That it is inseparably essential to the freedom of a people, and the undoubted right of Englishmen, that no taxes be imposed on them, but with their own consent, given personally, or by their representatives."  Both Massachusetts and Pennsylvania brought forth the issue in separate resolutions even more directly when they respectively referred to "the Natural rights of Mankind" and "the common rights of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Morgan pg. 151–152. "Thus by the fall of 1765 the colonists had clearly laid down the line where they believed that Parliament should stop, and they had drawn that line not merely as Englishmen but as men."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Gadsden]] of South Carolina had proposed that the Congress' petition should go only to the king, since the rights of the colonies did not originate with Parliament. This radical proposal went too far for most delegates and was rejected. The "Declaration of Rights and Grievances" was duly sent to the king, and petitions were also sent to both Houses of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Morgan pg. 147–148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repeal==

Grenville was replaced by [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]] as Prime Minister on 10 July 1765.  News of the mob violence began to reach England in October. Conflicting sentiments were taking hold in Britain at the same time that resistance was building and accelerating in America. Some wanted to strictly enforce the Stamp Act over colonial resistance, wary of the precedent that would be set by backing down.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff pg. 111–113&lt;/ref&gt;  Others felt the economic effects of reduced trade with America after the Sugar Act and an inability to collect debts while the colonial economy suffered, and they began to lobby for a repeal of the Stamp Act.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff pg. 111–113.  Miller pg. 149–151&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial protest had included various non-importation agreements among merchants who recognized that a significant portion of British industry and commerce was dependent on the colonial market.  This movement had also spread through the colonies; 200 merchants had met in New York City and agreed to import nothing from England until the Stamp Act was repealed.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Morgan pg.49–50, pg. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Repeal of the Stamp Act.jpg|thumb|This cartoon depicts the repeal of the Stamp Act as a funeral, with Grenville carrying a child's coffin marked "born 1765, died 1766"]]

When Parliament met in December 1765, it rejected a resolution offered by Grenville that would have condemned colonial resistance to the enforcement of the Act.  Outside of Parliament, Rockingham and his secretary [[Edmund Burke]], a member of Parliament himself, organized London merchants who started a committee of correspondence to support repeal of the Stamp Act by urging merchants throughout the country to contact their local representatives in Parliament.  When Parliament reconvened on 14 January 1766, the Rockingham ministry formally proposed repeal.  Amendments were considered that would have lessened the financial impact on the colonies by allowing colonists to pay the tax in their own [[scrip]], but this was viewed to be too little and too late.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff pg. 113–114.  Miller pg. 153.  Miller wrote of the Rockingham ministry, "Of all the Whig factions, the Rockinghams were most benevolent toward the colonies.  While they were as determined ... as [other factions] to maintain the sovereignty of great Britain, they insisted [that] the Americans must be treated as customers rather than as rebellious rogues who merited a sound whipping."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] stated in the Parliamentary debate that everything done by the Grenville ministry "has been entirely wrong" with respect to the colonies.  He further stated, "It is my opinion that this Kingdom has no right to lay a tax upon the colonies." Pitt still maintained "the authority of this kingdom over the colonies, to be sovereign and supreme, in every circumstance of government and legislature whatsoever," but he made the distinction that taxes were not part of governing, but were "a voluntary gift and grant of the Commons alone."  He rejected the notion of virtual representation, as "the most contemptible idea that ever entered into the head of man."&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Grenville responded to Pitt:

{{quote|Protection and obedience are reciprocal.  Great Britain protects America; America is bound to yield obedience.  If, not, tell me when the Americans were emancipated?  When they want the protection of this kingdom, they are always ready to ask for it.  That protection has always been afforded them in the most full and ample manner.  The nation has run itself into an immense debt to give them their protection; and now they are called upon to contribute a small share towards the public expence, and expence arising from themselves, they renounce your authority, insult your officers, and break out, I might also say, into open rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pitt’s response to Grenville included, "I rejoice that America has resisted.  Three millions of people, so dead to all the feelings of liberty as voluntarily to submit to be slaves, would have been fit instruments to make slaves of the rest."&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff pg. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 17 and 27 January, Rockingham shifted the attention from constitutional arguments to economic by presenting petitions complaining of the economic repercussions felt throughout the country.  On 7 February, the House of Commons rejected a resolution by 274–134, saying that it would back the King in enforcing the Act.  [[Henry Seymour Conway]], the government's [[Leader of the House of Commons|leader in the House of Commons]], introduced the [[Declaratory Act]] in an attempt to address both the constitutional and the economic issues, which affirmed the right of Parliament to legislate for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever", while admitting the inexpediency of attempting to enforce the Stamp Act.  Only Pitt and three or four others voted against it. Other resolutions passed which condemned the riots and demanded compensation from the colonies for those who suffered losses because of the actions of the mobs.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff pg. 117–119&lt;/ref&gt;

The House of Commons heard testimony between 11 and 13 February, the most important witness being Benjamin Franklin on the last day of the hearings. He responded to the question about how the colonists would react if the Act was not repealed: "A total loss of the respect and affection the people of America bear to this country, and of all the commerce that depends on that respect and affection." A Scottish journalist observed Franklin's answers to Parliament and his affect on the repeal; he later wrote to Franklin, "To this very Examination, more than to any thing else, you are indebted to the speedy and total Repeal of this odious Law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-13-02-0035|title=Founders Online: Examination before the Committee of the Whole of the House of ...|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A resolution was introduced on 21 February to repeal the Stamp Act, and it passed by a vote of 276–168.  The King gave royal assent on 18 March 1766.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff pg. 121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=[[s:Glorious News, Boston, Friday 11 o'Clock, 16th May 1766|Glorious News, Boston, Friday 11 o'Clock, 16 May 1766]] | work=London Gazette | date=16 May 1776 | location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
{{main|American Revolution}}
Some aspects of the resistance to the act provided a sort of rehearsal for similar acts of resistance to the 1767 [[Townshend Acts]], particularly the activities of the Sons of Liberty and merchants in organizing opposition.  The Stamp Act Congress was a predecessor to the later [[Continental Congress]]es, notably the [[Second Continental Congress]] which oversaw the establishment of American independence.  The Committees of Correspondence used to coordinate activities were revived between 1772 and 1774 in response to a variety of controversial and unpopular affairs, and the colonies that met at the 1774 [[First Continental Congress]] established a non-importation agreement known as the [[Continental Association]] in response to Parliamentary passage of the [[Intolerable Acts]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

'''''State of Georgia v.  Allison''''' was a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] court case.  In Georgia vs Allison, Janet Allison was convicted of [[sex offender|sexual offenses]] for  allowing her (then pregnant) daughter, aged 15, to have sexual intercourse in her home.&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events took place in the year 2000. The young couple later married and had a child of their own,&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt; but Allison's name has been entered into the [[Sex offender registries in the United States|sex offender registry]], with various adverse consequences for her life and that of her family.

As a [[family law]] matter, the case was not widely reported in the popular press at the time, but Allison's plight has subsequently attracted attention from publications and television programmes critical of the State of Georgia's stance on sex offenders.&lt;ref name="Geraghty"&gt;

 |quote       = On June 20, 2006, the Southern Center and the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit challenging the residency restrictions in Georgia's law. The case is still in court. Currently no one on the registry may work within 1,000 feet of a school, church or daycare center. Many people on the registry have been arrested for living in prohibited locations. The court has yet to make a ruling on the church provision, and several individuals have been told they must move and/or quit their jobs because they either live or work within 1,000 feet of a church.

Allison was not given a prison term, but three of her children were taken into [[foster care]]. 
She was obliged to leave her four bedroom home, because it is unlawful for a sex offender to live within a quarter of a mile of a church, and now lives in a mobile home "way off down a dirt road".&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt;  She is allowed no contact with the daughter involved, nor with her grandchild.&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt;
Further changes to Georgia's laws on sex offenders in 2006 strengthened the restrictions on where Allison could live.&lt;ref name=Newstandardnews&gt;

When Georgia's strict sex offender residency law passed the state legislature in 2006, the bill's House sponsor, Jerry Keen, said Georgians should celebrate because sex offenders would be forced to leave Georgia. Keen stated: "We want people running away from Georgia. Given the toughest laws here, we think a lot of people could move to another state ... If it becomes too onerous and too inconvenient, they just may want to live somewhere else. And I don't care where, as long as it's not in Georgia."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V35/I2/Canlas-LaFlam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Allison was one of the plaintiffs who challenged the new provision of the sex offender law.  According to the ''[[Newstandard News]]'', Allison "has already been informed by county sheriffs that she must move, and, according to the complaint, she has unsuccessfully searched in five counties for an affordable home that would allow her to comply with the new law."

The [[Southern Center for Human Rights]] called this outcome [[United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] and has challenged it in the Federal courts.&lt;ref name="Southern"&gt;

On July 20, 2010, the Georgia legislature amended the law, relaxing some of the restrictions on some sex offenders.&lt;ref name=Mdjonline2010-07-20&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
According to ''[[Associated Press]]'' writer Greg Bluestein the relaxed restrictions included an appeal procedure, whereby those on the sex offender list could explain why they thought they should be removed. The restrictions on whether, and how close to schools and churches those on the list could live was also relaxed. Bluestein wrote "After losing court battle after court battle, state legislators were forced to make a change or a federal judge was going to throw out the entire law." As someone convicted before 2003, Allison no longer faces a residency restriction.&lt;ref name=ForensicPsychologist2010-07-20&gt;

'''''Taylor v Attorney-General''''' '''[2015] NZHC 1706''' is a New Zealand [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] judgment which made a formal [[Writ|declaration]] that a [[statute]] that prohibited prisoners from voting is inconsistent with the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]]. The action was brought by [[Arthur William Taylor|Arthur Taylor]], a high-profile prison inmate. This was the first time a court had recognised that a formal declaration of inconsistency is an available remedy for statutory breaches of the Bill of Rights. Section 5 of the Bill of Rights Act states, "Subject to section 4, the rights and freedoms contained in this Bill of Rights may be subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and [[Democracy|democratic]] society."&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In his decision, Justice Heath declared that the Electoral (Disqualification of Sentenced Prisoners) Amendment Act 2010 which stripped all [[Suffrage|voting rights]] in [[Elections in New Zealand|general elections]] from [[prisoner]]s was an unjustified limitation on the right to vote contained in s 12 of the Bill of Rights. The [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] upheld this decision after the Attorney-General appealed the [[jurisdiction]] of the courts to make declarations of inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Justice Heath summarised the background to the [[Judicial review in New Zealand|legal challenge]] being, "As a result of an amendment made to the Electoral Act 1993 (the 1993 Act) in 2010, all prisoners incarcerated as a result of a sentence imposed after 16 December 2010 are barred from voting in a General Election."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Taylor v Attorney-General'' [2015] NZHC 1706 at [3].&lt;/ref&gt; In response to [[disenfranchisement]], five serving prisoners including [[career criminal]] [[Arthur William Taylor|Arthur Taylor]] "sought a formal declaration from this Court that the prohibition is inconsistent with s 12(a) of the Bill of Rights".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Mr Taylor was not himself affected by the Amendment Act because he was serving a term exceeding three years’ imprisonment, and had therefore already lost his right to vote; however the other four applicants came within the ambit of the Act, and no question was raised about Taylor's standing.&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v Attorney General'' [2015] NZHC 1706 at [3].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Attorney-General (New Zealand)|Attorney-General]] in his 2010 report on the law, mandated by [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990#Section 7 Reports|section 7]] of the Bill of Rights Act requiring that any inconsistencies with a Bill of Rights right be brought to the attention of Parliament, had concluded, "the blanket disenfranchisement of prisoners appears to be inconsistent with s 12 of the Bill of Rights Act and that it cannot be justified under s 5 of that Act".&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v Attorney-General'' [2015] NZHC 1706 at [27].&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the review proceeding to a substantive hearing the Attorney-General had tried unsuccessfully to have the challenge [[Summary judgment|struck out]] on the grounds courts had no jurisdiction over this matter and that any relief given "would breach the fundament [[Comity|principle of comity]] applying to the relationship between the judiciary and Parliament".&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v Attorney-General'' [2014] NZHC 1630 at [21].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
In his judgment Justice Heath adopted the reasons given by the Attorney-General in his s 7 report to [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] on the Electoral (Disqualification of Sentenced Prisoners) Amendment Act's inconsistency with the Bill of Rights Act.&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v Attorney-General'' [2015] NZHC 1706 at [33].&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons given by the Attorney-General in his report included that "The objective of the Bill is not rationally linked to the blanket ban on prisoner voting. It is questionable that every person serving a sentence of imprisonment is necessarily a serious offender. People who are not serious offenders will be disenfranchised."&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v Attorney-General'' [2015] NZHC 1706 at [29].&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Heath added that there was also an inconsistency with the right to vote in that the law created an arbitrary disparity between those sentenced to imprisonment and those to [[home detention]]; {{Cquote|Two co-offenders with equal culpability may receive different types of sentences to respond to the same offending. When one is sentenced to home detention and the other is imprisoned, that will often be because one does not have a suitable address at which home detention can be served. The consequence of the disparity in sentencing is that the offender who is sentenced to imprisonment loses his or her right to vote, whereas the home detainee does not. That is an arbitrary outcome.|author=Heath J|source=''Taylor v Attorney-General''&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v Attorney-General'' [2015] NZHC 1706 at [35].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a result, Justice Heath made a declaration mirroring the declaration the Attorney-General had made in his s 7 report;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Section 80(1)(d) of the Electoral Act 1993 (as amended by the Electoral (Disqualification of Sentenced Prisoners) Amendment Act 2010) is inconsistent with the right to vote affirmed and guaranteed in s 12(a) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, and cannot be justified under s 5 of that Act.&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v Attorney-General'' [2015] NZHC 1706 at [79].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In coming to his conclusion Justice Heath noted, {{Cquote|The inconsistency arises in the context of the most fundamental aspect of a democracy; namely, the right of all citizens to elect those who will govern on their behalf. Looking at the point solely as one of discretion, if a declaration were not made in this case, it is difficult to conceive of one in which it would. Enactment of a statutory provision that is inconsistent with that fundamental right should be marked by a formal declaration of the High Court, rather than by an observation buried in its reasons for judgment.|author=Heath J|source=''Taylor v Attorney-General''&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v Attorney-General'' [2015] NZHC 1706 at [77].&lt;/ref&gt;}} This statement acted as a response to the Attorney-General's argument that the Court's jurisdiction was limited to indications of inconsistency as seen in ''Hansen''.&lt;ref&gt;''Hansen v R'' [2007] NZSC 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case McGrath J stated that “a New Zealand Court must never shirk its responsibility to indicate, in any case where it concludes that the measure being considered is inconsistent with protected rights, that it has inquired into the possibility of there being an available rights-consistent interpretation [and] that none could be found”.&lt;ref&gt;''Hansen v R'' [2007] NZSC 7 at [253].&lt;/ref&gt; Heath J held that this precedent for indications did not preclude a formal declaration being made when appropriate.

==The appeal==
The Attorney-General [[appeal]]ed Heath J's decision, and the case was reconsidered by the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215.&lt;/ref&gt;  The central issue on appeal was whether the High Court should have made a declaration of inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [4].&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeal reviewed both the [[jurisdiction]] of the courts to make such a declaration and its suitability in the circumstances, and affirmed the decision of the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [189].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] challenged the use of parliamentary proceedings in the High Court decision, arguing that this was a breach of [[parliamentary privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [5].&lt;/ref&gt; The Court concluded that no such breach had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [146].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jurisdiction for declarations===
The Attorney-General argued that a declaration was not within the jurisdiction of the courts because it had not been expressly authorised by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [41].&lt;/ref&gt; He contended that the Declaratory Judgments Act 1908&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1908/0220/5.0/DLM176193.html#DLM176197| Declaratory Judgments Act 1908]&lt;/ref&gt; had sufficiently covered the area, and that this effectively ruled out such a remedy at common law.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [41].&lt;/ref&gt; The Court disagreed: it stated that the Declaratory Judgments Act did not exclude jurisdiction of the courts,&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [65].&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to establish multiple sources conferring jurisdiction.

The first source of jurisdiction considered by the Court was the Bill of Rights Act itself. The Bill of Rights does not expressly grant the power to make declarations, nor does it exclude such a power.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [85].&lt;/ref&gt; The Attorney-General accepted that sections 2-6  of the Bill allow the courts to identify inconsistencies between protected rights and other statutes, but said that this is limited to simply making indications of incompatibility, not formal declarations.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [91].&lt;/ref&gt; The Court did not accept this jurisdictional limit. It held that the Bill of Rights intended the courts to point out unjustified limitations on rights,&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [85].&lt;/ref&gt; and that to exclude declarations would be contrary to both this purpose and to New Zealand's obligations under the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [91].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a declaration would provide a domestic remedy prior to any available internationally. The Court cited [[Simpson v Attorney-General|''Baigent’s Case'']]&lt;ref&gt;''Simpson v Attorney-General'' [Baigent’s Case] [1994] 3 NZLR 667 (CA) at 691 per Casey J.&lt;/ref&gt; in stating that it would make no sense for Parliament to contemplate that New Zealand citizens could seek redress from the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]], but not from their own courts.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [89].&lt;/ref&gt;

Next the Court turned to a number of cases that suggested the jurisdiction to make declarations should exist.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [93]-[103].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Temese'' showed acceptance of such a possibility as early as 1992,&lt;ref&gt;''Temese v Police'' (1992) 9 CRNZ 425 (CA) at 427 per Cooke P.&lt;/ref&gt; supported by ''Baigent’s Case'' two years later.&lt;ref&gt;''Simpson v Attorney-General'' [Baigent’s Case] [1994] 3 NZLR 667 (CA).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[same-sex marriage in New Zealand|''Quilter v Attorney-General'']], the Court held that the [[Marriage Act 1955]] was an unjustified limitation on the right to freedom from discrimination of same sex couples.&lt;ref&gt; ''Quilter v Attorney-General'' [1988] 1 NZLR 523.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court in ''Quilter'' stated: "… once Parliament has charged the Courts with the task of giving meaning and effect to the fundamental rights and freedoms affirmed in the Bill of Rights, it would be a serious error not to proclaim a violation if and when a violation is found to exist in the law."&lt;ref&gt;''Quilter v Attorney-General'' [1988] 1 NZLR 523 at 554 per Thomas J.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeal in ''Attorney-General v Taylor'' saw this as further acknowledgment of the jurisdiction to make a declaration.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [95].&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Zaoui v Attorney-General (No 2)|''Zaoui v Attorney-General'']] included an argument by the Crown that the Court did not have the jurisdiction to make a declaration of inconsistency, and although the High Court did not consider such a declaration appropriate in the circumstances, it acknowledged that the jurisdiction to do so clearly existed.&lt;ref&gt;''Zaoui v Attorney-General'' [2004] 2 NZLR 339 (HC) at [166].&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the most recent case ''Hansen v R'' observed that: "a major purpose of a Bill of Rights (entrenched or otherwise) is to prevent minority interests from being overridden by an oppressive or overzealous majority."&lt;ref&gt;''Hansen v R'' [2007] NZSC 7 at [107] per Tipping J.&lt;/ref&gt; These precedents were taken by the Court of Appeal as convincing support for the jurisdiction of declarations of inconsistency.

Finally, the Court of Appeal supported the finding of Heath J that section 92J of the [[Human Rights Act 1993]] shows a Parliamentary acceptance of a court's jurisdiction to make declarations of inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [107].&lt;/ref&gt;  This section gives the [[Human Rights Review Tribunal]] the power to declare that an enactment is inconsistent with section 19 of the Bill of Rights, which protects the right to freedom from discrimination. In ''Taylor v Attorney-General'', Heath J stated that it would be difficult to comprehend that Parliament would confer this declaratory power on the Tribunal but not on a more senior court.&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v Attorney-General'' [2015] NZHC 1706 at [64].&lt;/ref&gt; This is reinforced by the fact that the statute also allows a right of appeal from the Tribunal to the High Court about such declarations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/latest/DLM304212.html Human Rights Act 1993, ss 123(2)(c)-(d).]&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeal agreed with this reasoning.

===When a declaration should be made===
Having determined that declarations of inconsistency are within the jurisdiction of the High Court, the Court of Appeal went on to consider when such declarations should be made. It stated that the remedy is one of [[discretion]], and is not available as of right.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [168].&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases an indication of incompatibility would suffice, rather than a formal declaration.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [162].&lt;/ref&gt; However the Court accepted that there would certainly be times when a declaration should be used: {{Cquote|A court will consider a DoI only where it is satisfied that the enactment impinges further on a protected right than can be justified in a free and democratic society, and such a conclusion can be reached only after evaluating the policy underlying the enactment and assessing any invitation to defer to another branch of government.|author=Wild and Milling JJ|source=''Attorney-General v Taylor''&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [153].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Court held that in the case before them, a declaration was the appropriate remedy.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [185].&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this were: the right to vote is an essential element of a free and democratic society; the limitation on this right was not justified; the legislature was aware of the inconsistency at the time of enactment; and there were no overseas developments that may cause Parliament to reconsider the Act independently.&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v Attorney-General'' [2015] NZHC 1706 at [185].&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeal did state that Mr Taylor should not have been granted a declaration by himself because the Act in question did not affect him, but as the declaration was made in a single proceeding with joint plaintiffs who were affected, it was correct of the High Court to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [189].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary privilege===
The [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] raised a second challenge to the High Court's declaration by arguing that the High Court had breached [[parliamentary privilege]]. In coming to his decision, Heath J had examined the section 7 report before reaching the same conclusion, and the Speaker was concerned that he had effectively reviewed a parliamentary proceeding in doing so.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [137].&lt;/ref&gt; This could be a breach of parliamentary privilege if the Court had questioned Parliament's treatment of the issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2014/0058/latest/whole.html#DLM6136730 Parliamentary Privilege Act 2014, s 11.]&lt;/ref&gt; However the Court of Appeal held that Heath J had not done so; he had merely described the parliamentary processes and noted the report's existence before coming to his own conclusion about the same subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [129].&lt;/ref&gt; This was an acceptable purpose for using such material.&lt;ref&gt;''Buchanan v Jennings'' [2001] 3 NZLR 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also noted that the same situation had occurred in ''Hansen v R''&lt;ref&gt;''Hansen v R'' [2007] NZSC 7.&lt;/ref&gt; by members of the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [129].&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this second challenge was also dispensed with, as parliamentary privilege had not been breached by the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [146].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
This was the first time a court in New Zealand had recognised that a formal declaration of inconsistency is an available remedy for statutory breaches of the Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1507/S00229/taylor-v-ag-prison-voting-law-inconsistent-bill-of-rights.htm|title = Taylor v AG: Prison voting law inconsistent Bill of Rights|last = New Zealand High Court|first = |date = 24 July 2015|work = Scoop|access-date = 15 September 2015|via = scoop.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Taylor, in a recorded statement to [[Radio New Zealand]] after the verdict said, "His Honour Justice Heath's very courageous decision strikes a strong blow for the rule of law, not only for prisoners, but all other New Zealanders, in upholding their fundamental rights against even the Parliament".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/279646/prison-vote-law-breaches-human-rights-judge|title = Prison vote law breaches human rights - judge|last = Newton|first = Kate|date = 25 July 2015|work = Radio New Zealand|access-date = 27 July 2015|via = radionz.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; A declaration of inconsistency acts as a powerful vindication for those who have no other way of receiving remedy for breaches of their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://equaljusticeproject.co.nz/2017/07/keeping-a-check-on-parliament-the-decision-of-attorney-general-v-taylor/|title = Keeping a Check on Parliament: the Decision of Attorney-General v Taylor|last = Curiae|first= Amicus|work = Equal Justice Project|access-date = 3 September 2017|via = equaljusticeproject.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other significant outcome of the decision that declarations of inconsistency are within the jurisdiction of the courts is that it acts as a powerful check on [[parliamentary sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://equaljusticeproject.co.nz/2017/07/keeping-a-check-on-parliament-the-decision-of-attorney-general-v-taylor/|title = Keeping a Check on Parliament: the Decision of Attorney-General v Taylor|last = Curiae|first= Amicus|work = Equal Justice Project|access-date = 3 September 2017|via = equaljusticeproject.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand Parliament is supreme, but this power of the courts to declare laws to be inconsistent places a burden on this supremacy, by requiring that Parliament uphold the fundamental rights of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.adls.org.nz/for-the-profession/news-and-opinion/2017/6/16/a-constitutional-call-to-action/|title = A constitutional call to action|last = Winter|first = Stephen|work = ADLS|access-date = 31 August 2017|via = www.adls.org.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; It affirms the courts as “upholders of rights, standing between ordinary citizens and the might of Parliament.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://equaljusticeproject.co.nz/2017/07/keeping-a-check-on-parliament-the-decision-of-attorney-general-v-taylor/|title = Keeping a Check on Parliament: the Decision of Attorney-General v Taylor|last = Curiae|first= Amicus|work = Equal Justice Project|access-date = 3 September 2017|via = equaljusticeproject.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The extent of the significance of this case will depend on whether Parliament remedies the Act in question.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Palmer “What the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act aimed to do, why it did not succeed and how it can be repaired” (2016) 14(2) New Zealand Journal of Public and International Law 169 at 178.&lt;/ref&gt; A declaration of inconsistency does not invalidate the law, or force Parliament to change the offending statute accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.adls.org.nz/for-the-profession/news-and-opinion/2017/6/16/a-constitutional-call-to-action/|title = A constitutional call to action|last = Winter|first = Stephen|work = ADLS|access-date = 31 August 2017|via = www.adls.org.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Taylor'' merely expresses that the courts have a “reasonable expectation that other branches of government, respecting the judicial function, will respond by reappraising the legislation and making any changes that are thought appropriate.”&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Taylor'' [2017] NZCA 215 at [151].&lt;/ref&gt; If Parliament chooses to enact a rights-consistent version of the Electoral (Disqualification of Sentenced Prisoners) Amendment Act then ''Taylor'' could mark the beginning of a major constitutional development in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.adls.org.nz/for-the-profession/news-and-opinion/2017/6/16/a-constitutional-call-to-action/|title = A constitutional call to action|last = Winter|first = Stephen|work = ADLS|access-date = 31 August 2017|via = www.adls.org.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7060">The '''Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act''' (abbreviated '''UPMIFA''') is a [[uniform act]] that provides guidance on investment decisions and endowment expenditures for nonprofit and charitable organizations. As of 2012&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniformlaws.org/NewsDetail.aspx?title=Mississippi%20newest%20state%20to%20enact%20UPMIFA&lt;/ref&gt; UPMIFA is the law in 49 states, the [[District of Columbia]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;http://uniformlaws.org/LegislativeFactSheet.aspx?title=Prudent%20Management%20of%20Institutional%20Funds%20Act&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Pennsylvania&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finance.upenn.edu/vpfinance/AnnualRpt/Financial_Report_13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; nor Puerto Rico&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniformlaws.org/NewsDetail.aspx?title=Mississippi%20newest%20state%20to%20enact%20UPMIFA&lt;/ref&gt; has adopted UPMIFA.

The major change in UPMIFA compared to the previous model law (the [[Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act]]) is that it replaces a requirement that nonprofits cannot spend below the original value of contributions or "historic dollar value" (HDV) with a new requirement that their investing and spending will be at a rate that will preserve the purchasing power of the principal over the long term.

==History==

===Predecessor===
The predecessor to UPMIFA, called the [[Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act]] (UMIFA), was approved by the [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]] (NCCUSL) in 1972 and was enacted by 47 states. Under UMIFA a charity could spend from an endowment fund up to the amount of appreciation above the historic dollar value (HDV), but could never spend below HDV.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Gary, "[http://www.nccusl.org/Update/Docs/UMIFA%20Becomes%20UPMIFA.pdf UMIFA Becomes UPMIFA]," ABA Property and Probate Journal, January/February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2009, the North Carolina Symphony had $6.9 million in its endowment but was unable to touch a penny because North Carolina law, at that time based on the UMIFA model, said that money could not be touched because the market value of the endowment was below HDV because of the slump on Wall Street.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Meyer, "[http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2009/03/some_troubled_nonprofits_cant.html Some troubled nonprofits can’t get their money]," Cleveland Plain Dealer, March 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; North Carolina has since adopted UPMIFA.

===Enactment===

The NCCUSL on July 13, 2006 approved UPMIFA as a replacement to UMIFA, adding the P for "prudent", which emphasizes the perpetuation of the original purchasing power of the fund, not just the original dollars contributed to the fund.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Gary, "[http://www.nccusl.org/Update/Docs/UMIFA%20Becomes%20UPMIFA.pdf UMIFA Becomes UPMIFA]," ABA Property and Probate Journal, January/February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key provision of UPMIFA states that: "Subject to the [[donor intent|intent of a donor]] expressed in the gift instrument an institution may appropriate for expenditure or accumulate so much of an endowment fund as the institution determines is prudent for the uses, benefits, purposes, and duration for which the endowment fund is established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/umoifa/2006final_act.pdf Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

This uniform law is adopted state by state, and therefore the law may be slightly different in each state.  For example, on September 20, 2010, New York Gov. [[David Paterson]] signed into law the New York version of UPMIFA called the New York Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act or NYPMIFA.&lt;ref&gt;Tracey Drury, "[http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2010/09/20/daily21.html Paterson signs charity-endowment law]," The Business Review, September 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on nonprofits==

The major impact of UPMIFA on nonprofit endowments is that they are now allowed to spend from an "underwater" endowment if the governing board determines it is prudent to do so based on seven specific factors. Many states have adopted an optional provision to limit the spending to 7% unless the board can show that the spending meets UPMIFA's standards of prudence. .  This  board-approved spending policy must be based on the average market value of the endowment investments over the 12 quarters (or more) immediately preceding the calculation.  This aspect of UPMIFA applies only to permanent restricted endowments, which are restricted by the donor or law.&lt;ref&gt;Rebeka Mazzone, "[http://www.blackbaud.com/files/Newsletters/FiscalFitness/2009/FF_July2009.htm The Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act]," Nonprofit Fiscal Fitness, July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, UPMIFA contains several standards of prudence regarding investing decisions and delegation of investment management.

In March and April 2009, the [[Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges]] (AGB) conducted a survey of colleges, universities and affiliated foundations in states in which UPMIFA has been enacted to learn how institutions have been managing endowment spending under UPMIFA.  The survey found that:
* On average, 38 percent of the dollar value of participants total endowment pool was underwater as of December 31, 2008.
* 31.3 percent are continuing distributions in keeping with their normal spending rule
* 26.8 percent are suspending distributions from funds at or below HDV
* 15.6 percent are making distributions from underwater funds at some rate less than their normal spending rule by yielding more than interest and dividends
* 9.5 percent are distributing only interest and dividends&lt;ref&gt;David Bass, "[http://agb.org/system/files/u16/UPMIFASurvey.pdf Management of Underwater Endowments Under UPMIFA],"  Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges survey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey Dale, director of the National Center on Philanthropy and the Law at [[New York University]], said changing the law is long overdue. "There are a lot of more recent funds that have gone underwater because of the current financial tsunami," Dale said. "So what do you do? If you're in a state that still has UMIFA, you're screwed."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Stripling, "[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/03/03/endowment Tight Leash]," Inside Higher Ed, March 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebeka Mazzone, CPA, recommends: "[Today's boards] ... need to consider what spending rules would be reasonable and appropriate in relation to the assets available, the wishes of the donor, the role that each investment or course of action plays within the overall investment portfolio, and the needs of the institution and the fund to make distributions and to preserve capital." &lt;ref&gt;Rebeka J. Mazzone, CPA, Talking to Your Board About UPMIFA "[http://www.amsolutions.net/white-paper/talking-your-board-about-upmifa]," Accounting Management Solutions White Paper&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Family law}}

A '''voidable marriage''' (also called an '''avoidable marriage''') is a [[marriage]] which can be canceled at the option of one of the parties. The marriage is valid but is subject to cancellation if contested in court by one of the parties to the marriage.

A voidable marriage is contrasted with a [[void marriage]], which is one that is on its face unlawful and therefore legally has no effect, whether or not one of the parties challenges the marriage.

==History==
The concept of "voidable marriage" arose from the early ecclesiastical courts which had jurisdiction to determine what constituted a valid marriage. Some of the recognized impediments were subsumed into the civil courts which had jurisdiction over the right to and disposition of property.&lt;ref name=Goda&gt;[http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1491&amp;context=facpubs Goad, Paul J., "The Historical Evolution of the Concepts of Void and Voidable Marriages", 7 J. Fam. L. 297]&lt;/ref&gt;

Common reasons that would make a marriage voidable include those that indicate either party to the marriage did not validly consent, such as duress, mistake, intoxication, or mental defect.&lt;ref name=farrer&gt;[http://www.farrer.co.uk/Global/1/When_is_marriage_not_a_marriage.pdf Harrigin, Flora. "When is marriage not a marriage?", ''The Review'', issue 162, January/February 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of a voidable marriage can only be made by one of the parties to the marriage; thus, a voidable marriage cannot be annulled after the death of one of the parties.

A '''waybill''' ([[International Union of Railways|UIC]]) is a document issued by a [[common carrier|carrier]] giving details and instructions relating to the [[shipment]] of a [[consignment]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Typically it will show the names of the [[consignor]] and [[consignee]], the point of origin of the consignment, its destination, and [[Thoroughfare|route]]. Most freight forwarders and trucking companies use an in-house waybill called a house bill. These typically contain "conditions of contract of carriage" terms on the back of the form. These terms cover limits to liability and other terms and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/waybill.html|title=What is a waybill? definition and meaning|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|publisher=WebFinance, Inc|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A waybill is similar to that of a courier's receipt which contains the details of the consignor and the consignee, and also the point of origin and destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.jctrans.net/jcnet/il/express/2007111542615.shtml|title=What are Courier's Receipt|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|publisher=JCtrans Technology Co., Ltd.|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air waybills==
Most airlines use a different form called an [[air waybill]] which lists additional items such as airport of destination, flight number, and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/air-waybill-AWB.html|title=What is air waybill(AWB)? definition and meaning|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|publisher=WebFinance, Inc|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sea waybills==
The UK [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.1(1) applies to: 
*[[bill of lading|bills of lading]] s.1(2), 
* sea waybills s.1(3), and 
* ships' delivery orders s.1(4), 
... whether in paper or electronic form s.1(5). 

Under s.1(3) of the Act, a sea waybill is: "any document which is not a bill of lading but is such a receipt for goods as contains a contract for the carriage of goods by sea; and identifies the person to whom delivery of the goods is to be made by the carrier in accordance with that contract".

s.2 continues: "...a person who becomes the person who (without being an original party to the contract of carriage) is the person to whom delivery of the goods to which a sea waybill relates is to be made by the carrier in accordance with that contract ... shall (by virtue of becoming the person to whom delivery is to be made) have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit under the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to the contract of carriage".

Note: the UK's [[Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999]] does NOT apply to contracts for the carriage of goods by sea.
