      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9762">In 2013, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] footballers, [[Ramez Dayoub]] (playing for [[Selangor FA]]) and [[Mahmoud El Ali]] (playing in [[Persiba Balikpapan]]), were banned for life by the [[Fédération Libanaise de Football Association|Lebanese Football Association]] for participating in match fixing scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsreporter.in/ex-churchill-player-implicated-in-lebanon-match-fixing-76338 |title=Ex-Churchill player implicated in Lebanon match-fixing |publisher=NewsReporter.in |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 22 players were investigated for this.

==Overview==
[[FIFA]] held an investigation in order to crack down on match fixing across the world. The investigation was mostly concentrated on European football, but the investigation also took place in Africa, South America and in Asia. In 2012, over 50 countries were under investigation for match-fixing. That number being about one quarter of the entire 209 member in FIFA’s governing body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Sports/Football/2013/Feb-12/206121-soccer-faces-epic-fight-against-match-fixing.ashx#axzz2Nmd98EFD |title=Soccer faces epic fight against match-fixing &amp;#124; Sports , Football |publisher=The Daily Star |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lebanese match fixing scandal was a report that led to the suspension of 24 Lebanese players in domestic clubs in Lebanon, Asian clubs, and even the Lebanese national team.&lt;ref name="dailystar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Sports/Football/2013/Feb-26/207996-24-lebanese-football-players-suspended-from-games.ashx#axzz2Nmd98EFD |title=24 Lebanese football players suspended from games &amp;#124; Sports , Football |publisher=The Daily Star |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspicion of a scandal within Lebanese football began in late 2012, when a large number of Lebanese players were accused of purposely losing games in the Lebanese league and other leagues across Asia. The scandal was not limited to only matches being played in football leagues across Asia, but also took place on the international level. The players would be bribed by large betting companies in order to throw away the game or put the other team in favor of winning the match.&lt;ref name="dailystar1"/&gt;  Once the scandal came to life, Lebanon’s Football Association began to investigate the allegations that were being made against the Lebanese football players. The LFA (Lebanese Football Association) appointed the General Secretary of West Asian Football Federation Fadi Zreiqat in order to lead the investigation. During the 2 month long investigation that involved more than 60 witnesses, the General Secretary of West Asian Football Federation Fadi Zreiqat conclusion proved that match fixing was actually occurring.&lt;ref name="dailystar1"/&gt;

In total, 24 players and 2 officials were involved in the match fixing scandal. Soon after Fadi Zreiqat’s conclusion, the Lebanese Football Association provided the players allocated in the scandal with fines and also suspensions from playing the sport. 20 Lebanese football players were suspended from playing the sport for 1 year and given a $3000 fine, while 2 players were suspended for 3 years and given each a $7000 fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/02/2013227105817610924.html |title=Lebanon footballers banned over match-fixing - Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These 22 players that were fined and suspended either belonged to the domestic league in Lebanon or other leagues across Asia. The most severe punishments came to Ramez Dayoub and Mahmoud Al Ali. These 2 players were given each a $15 000 fine and banned from playing the sport for life. Ramez Dayoub and Mahmoud Al Ali both play for Lebanon’s national football team and also club teams in Asia. The reason why Ramy Dyoub and Mahmoud Al Ali punishments were more severe than the other players was because the match fixing took place on the international level while they were playing for the national team of Lebanon. Mahmoud Al Ali and Ramez Dyoub have been associated with attempting and succeeding to throw away and manipulate the match on different occasions. The matches that these two players are allocated in are believed to be a tournament that took place in Saudi Arabia and there are rumors that they also took place during a match against Qatar in the 2014 World Cup Qualifiers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Crossman |first=Steve |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21718034 |title=BBC Sport - Lebanon head coach reveals anger over match fixing |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanon advanced for the first time in its history to the 4th and final round of the World Cup Qualifiers, but because of the match fixing scandal which led to a crucial loss, their hopes of qualifying for the 2014 tournament decreased significantly.  Theo Bucker, the German coach who took control of Lebanon’s national team in 2011 and took the team from being unsuccessful and having a negative performance, transformed the national team and made Lebanon qualify to the final round of the World Cup Qualification, he was extremely disappointed and frustrated. Theo Bucker made football the most watched sport in Lebanon and brought tremendous success by beating the Asian football giants Iran and South Korea. In 2012, Lebanon lost to Qatar in the World Cup Qualifiers 1-0. Ramez Dayoub had given an extremely terrible pass that was intercepted by the Qatar striker Sebastian Soria who gave Qatar their only goal to defeat Lebanon. After the investigation was complete, Bucker had the following to say : “We were showing some action and then suddenly a (Qatar) player has the ball in a one-on-one situation and you get the feeling that something is wrong. The guy looked paralysed or something.” His frustration toward Ramez Dayoub continued when he said “ I never came close to the idea that someone could not just sell the game, but sell their country”.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Soon after the Lebanese Football Associations handed out these penalties to the players involved in the match fixing scandal, FIFA sent a letter to the Lebanese Football Association and praised them for the way they responded to the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/fifa-praises-lebanon-matchfixing-response-070434052--sow.html |accessdate=March 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522125714/http://sports.yahoo.com/news/fifa-praises-lebanon-matchfixing-response-070434052--sow.html |archivedate=May 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Ramez Dayoub]] was pulled minutes before by his own teammates before the [[AFC Cup]] match against [[Kingfisher East Bengal]]. [[Selangor FA]] lost the match 1-0 as [[Lalrindika Ralte]] scored a goal. Besides being banned for life they were also fined $15,000. Ramez told [[Fox Sports]] "I am not guilty. They have suspended me and accused me of matchfixing without any evidence or proof,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reuters |url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/afc-launches-probe-after-players-given-life-bans-for-matchfixing-by-lebanese-football-authorities |title=AFC launches probe after players given life bans for matchfixing by Lebanese football authorities - The National |publisher=Thenational.ae |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another two domestic players, Al-Negma's Mohamad Jaafar and Al Ahed's Hadi Sahmarani, were banned for three seasons and handed $7,000 fines for their involvement. Ten more of Sahmarani's teammates at the Lebanese Premier League club were banned for a year and each given $2,000 fines. Among the 22, one is [[Akram Moghrabi]], who played for [[Churchill Brothers S.C.]] in [[2012-13 I-League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/football/news/item/204307-ex-churchill-player-akram-moghrabi-implicated-in-lebanon-match-fixing |title=Ex-Churchill player Akram Moghrabi implicated in Lebanon match-fixing &amp;#124; Football - News &amp;#124; NDTVSports.com |publisher=Sports.ndtv.com |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AFC has received the summary report from the LFA on their investigations and subsequent action against involvement of Lebanese players in match-fixing. AFC has also requested LFA to provide the full investigation report. The LFA has informed the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and the federations of Malaysia and Indonesia of sanctions on Lebanese players plying their trade in these countries.

[[File:AntelArenaInauguracion.jpg|thumb|The interior of Antel Arena, during its inauguration.]]
The '' 'Antel Arena' '' is a multipurpose [[indoor arena]] that is located in the neighborhood of [[Villa Española]], [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. The arena has a capacity of 15,000 people for [[concerts]], and 10,000 people for [[basketball]] games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aegworldwide.com/divisions/facilities/antel-arena ANTEL ARENA.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iq-mag.net/2017/09/aeg-venue-uruguay-antel-arena/#.XAQbCGhKjIU AEG ANNOUNCES ANTEL ARENA, FIRST VENUE IN URUGUAY.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena is owned by [[ANTEL]], after they reached an agreement with the city of Montevideo, which granted them the rights to the arena for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fadu.edu.uy/patio/novedades/antel-arena.html ANTEL ARENA Publicado: 24 de junio, 2013 CONCURSO DE IDEAS ARQUITECTÓNICAS Y URBANÍSTICAS {{es icon}}.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.presidencia.gub.uy/comunicacion/comunicacionnoticias/antel-arena-convenio Comienza limpieza de predio para la construcción del Antel Arena tras firma de convenio {{es icon}}.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The arena was built at the location of the old [[Cilindro Municipal]], after it was left in a dilapidated state after a fire. Before the Antel Arena could be constructed, the old Cilindro Municipal had to be demolished. Construction on Antel Arena began in May of 2014, and the arena opened on November 12, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/sociedad/antel-arena-inaugura-noviembre.html El Antel Arena se inaugura el 12 de noviembre {{es icon}}.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/costo-antel-arena-mira-oposicion.html El costo del Antel Arena en la mira de la oposición {{es icon}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The arena was used to host home games of the senior men's [[Uruguayan national basketball team]], during [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Americas)|2019 FIBA World Cup Americas qualifiers]].

And it was part of the [[Argentina–Uruguay bid for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup]] but withdrawn the 2027 bid after losing the right for the 2023 tournament to [[Philippines]], [[Japan]] and [[Indonesia]].

'''Beach Soccer''', also known as '''beach football''' or '''beasal''', is a variant of [[association football]] played on a [[beach]] or some form of sand.

The game emphasises skill, agility and accuracy in shooting at the goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8201000/8201176.stm |title=BBC – Manchester – Life’s a beach in Tameside |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst [[football]] has been played informally on beaches for many years, the introduction of ''beach soccer'' was an attempt to codify rules for the game. This was done in 1992 by the founders of [[Beach Soccer Worldwide]], a company set up to develop the sport and responsible for the majority of its tournaments to this day. This was a major foundation for what is now known as beach soccer and what has led to the sport rapidly growing in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pickup |first=Oliver |url=http://sabotagetimes.com/sport/sand-aliens-heel-flicks-introducing-the-england-beach-soccer-team |title=Sand Aliens &amp; Heel Flicks: Introducing The England Beach Soccer Team |publisher=Sabotage Times |date=2013-09-04 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The irregularity of the soft-sand playing surface leads to a totally different style of play than is used in football, with a greater degree of improvisation. The compact field, much smaller than a normal [[association football pitch|football field]], allows players to score from anywhere on the sand, leading to an average of sixty attempts at goal in a single game. With an average scoring rate of one goal every three or four minutes, around eleven goals are scored in total during an average game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garry |first=Tom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36908223 |title=Women's Beach Soccer: Sun, sea, sand, bicycle kicks and a European Championship |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=2014-11-03 |accessdate=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|Beach Soccer Worldwide}}

=== Foundation ===
Beach football ({{lang|pt|beasal}} or ''futebol de areia'') started in [[Brazil]], more precisely at [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In 1950 the first official tournament was created to unite neighborhood small tourneys that happened since 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mail.camara.rj.gov.br/APL/Legislativos/scpro1720.nsf/0/832580830061F31883258074005B296D|title=Projeto de Lei 2102/2016 - Clause 2102/2016|last=|first=|date=|website=Câmara do Rio de Janeiro|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After huge popularity it has grown to be an international game. The participation of internationally renowned players such as flamboyant [[France|Frenchman]] [[Eric Cantona]], legendary [[Spain|Spanish]] strikers [[José Miguel González Martín|Michel]] and [[Julio Salinas]] and [[Brazil]]ian stars such as [[Romário]], [[Leovegildo Lins da Gama Júnior|Júnior]] and [[Zico]] has helped to expand [[television]] coverage to large audiences in over 170 countries worldwide.

Beach soccer had been played recreationally all over the world for many years and in many different formats. In 1992 the laws of the game were envisioned and a pilot event was staged by the founding partners of BSWW in [[Los Angeles]]. By 1993, the first professional beach soccer competition was organized at [[Miami Beach]], with teams from the [[United States]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[Italy]] taking part.

=== Growth ===
[[File:06 Chgo Beach Soccer Invitational Challenge me.JPG|thumbnail|left|A beach soccer game at the 2006 Chicago Beach Soccer Invitational]]
In April 1994 the first event to be covered by network television transmissions was held on [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana Beach]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], and the city hosted the first [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup#Beach Soccer World Championships|Beach Soccer World Championship]] in 1995. The competition was won by the host nation, making Brazil the first-ever World Champions of Beach Soccer. The success of the tournament saw commercial interest begin to match developments on the field, and growing demand for the sport around the world gave rise to the [[Pro Beach Soccer Tour]] in 1996.

The first Pro Beach Soccer Tour included a total of 60 games in two years across [[South America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[United States]], attracting major names both on and off the field. Interest generated by the tour in Europe led to the creation of the [[European Pro Beach Soccer League]] in 1998, providing a solid infrastructure that would increase the professionalism of the spectacle on all levels. The EPBSL, now known as the Euro BS League, brought promoters together from across the continent and satisfied the demands of the media, sponsors and fans. Only four years on from its creation, the successful first step in the building of a legitimate worldwide competition structure for the sport of pro beach soccer had been taken.

Behind the scenes key developments were also taking place, with the Beach Soccer Company relocating its headquarters to Europe, firstly to [[Monaco]] and then [[Barcelona]], before becoming Pro Beach Soccer, S.L. in April 2000. One year later they would join forces with Octagon Koch Tavares, who had continued to organise the World Championships and events in South America, to form a single entity known as [[Beach Soccer Worldwide]] (BSWW), with the aim of unifying all major Pro Beach Soccer tournaments in the world under the same structure and providing representation of the sport to major sponsors, the media and [[FIFA]].

The EPBSL was also flourishing, a nail-biting 2000 season was decided in the closing match of the final tournament when [[Spain]] beat [[Portugal]] in an intense encounter. The Americas League also took shape, with teams entered from North and South America, whilst the Pro Beach Soccer Tour extended its horizons to the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Thailand]], [[Mexico]], [[Greece]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

FIFA became the global governing body of the sport in 2005, acknowledging BSWW's framework and organizing the [[2005 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup|first FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beachsoccer.com/tournaments/7|title=FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup|website=www.beachsoccer.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent years ===
The next four years would see this growth consolidated by further progress both on and off the field, with the EPBSL emerging as the strongest pro beach soccer competition in the world. By 2004, some seventeen nations had entered teams, with this number expected to rise to over &lt;ref&gt;twenty for the Euro BS League in 2005, contributing to vastly expanded television coverage of the series and unprecedented demand from promoters in more than seventy countries looking to&lt;/ref&gt; stage events.

Such interest has allowed BSWW to strike major sponsorship deals with international companies including [[McDonald's]], [[Coca-Cola]] and [[MasterCard]], who stepped up their involvement in 2004 and are now title sponsors of the Euro BS League. Recognition has also come from FIFA, who have cited BSWW as the major entity behind the creation and growth of Beach Soccer, forming a highly promising partnership that was in its full splendour seen in the 2005 world cup, held in Copacabana Beach, Brazil. France won the first world cup and the next year Brazil won it
at the same venue. The World Cup has continued to flourish with the first held outside Brazil in 2008, and future World Cups spreading as far out as [[Tahiti]] in [[2013 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup|2013]] and [[Portugal]] in [[2015 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup|2015]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/sport/inside_sport.asp?xfile=/data/nationsports/2013/November/nationsports_November156.xml&amp;section=nationsports|title=Beach soccer is bigger than beach volleyball: Cusco |work=Khaleej Times|first=Rituraj|last=Borkakoty|date=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, FIFA and the continental confederations do not host women's beach soccer tournaments. The [[Asian Beach Games]], [[European Games]] and [[South American Beach Games]] also do not have women's beach soccer tournaments.

== Rules ==
The rules of beach soccer are based on the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game of association football]], with several modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/52/76/01/lotgbeachsoccerweben_neutral.pdf|title=BEACH SOCCER - Laws of the Game 2015/2016|last=|first=|date=|website=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
=== Field ===
[[Image:Beachsoccer pitch.png|thumb|250px|right|A beach soccer pitch. The dashed white lines are not marked on the pitch, and must be inferred by players and officials.]]
A beach soccer field is a level sandy area considerably smaller than a regular [[association football pitch|football field]]. The field is cleared of pebbles and seashells, along with any other objects which could injure a player.

The field is rectangular in shape, and the [[touch line]] is longer than the goal line.
The field dimensions are:

*'''Length:''' {{convert|35|-|37|m|yd|abbr=off|1}}
*'''Width:''' {{convert|26|-|28|m|yd|abbr=off|1}}

The penalty area is within 9&amp;nbsp;m (9.8 yards) of the goals, and is marked by a yellow flag situated in touch. Two red flags opposite each other are at the center of the field to represent the half-way line. The goals are slightly smaller than their standard association football counterparts, being {{convert|2.2|m}} from the ground to the bottom of the crossbar and {{convert|5.5|m}} in width between the inside of each upright.

=== Players ===
Each team consists of five players, including the goalkeeper and an unlimited number of substitutions, from a selection of three to five players. Throw-ins and kick-ins mean the pace and flow of the game are much faster than regular football. Shoes are not allowed; players must play in bare feet, although ankle guards are permitted. Goal clearances (the equivalent of a [[goal kick]]) are taken by the goalkeeper using their hands to throw the ball and a goal cannot be scored directly from these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/somerset/hi/things_to_do/newsid_8199000/8199101.stm |title=BBC – The Guide: What's on in Somerset |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Match length ===
A game lasts thirty-six minutes, and is split up into three twelve-minute periods. Unlike association football, in professional matches the referee is not the sole arbiter of the end of a period. A separate timekeeping official controls the official game clock, which is stopped for stoppages in play, and typically counts down to zero, as in North American sports such as basketball and ice hockey. Draws are not permitted, with the game going into three minutes of [[extra time]], followed by a [[penalty shoot-out (football)|penalty shootout]] if the score is still on level terms after normal time. Unlike football, penalty kicks are decided by [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] rules.

=== Referees and discipline ===
Beach soccer has two on-field referees who co-operatively referee the game. They are assisted by a third referee, who acts in a manner similar to football's [[Fourth official|fourth official]] and a timekeeper.

As in football, [[Penalty card|yellow and red cards]] can be issued. Unlike in football, the team can then bring on a substitute to replace the dismissed player after two minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.ussoccer.com/Documents/cms/ussf/BeachSoccer_LawsEnglish.pdf |title=FIFA booklet – ''Beach Soccer Laws of the Game'' (2006) |publisher=Images.ussoccer.com |accessdate=2012-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325001236/http://images.ussoccer.com/Documents/cms/ussf/BeachSoccer_LawsEnglish.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to a [[Penalty (ice hockey)|power play]] in ice hockey, this period of numerical advantage ends early if the penalised team concedes a goal.

=== Free kicks and penalities ===
Free kicks are awarded for various fouls. All free kicks are [[Direct free kick|direct free kicks]] which has to be taken by the player who was fouled, unless awarded for deliberate handling. The laws specify that all players apart from the opposing goalkeeper must clear a zone between the kicker and the goal. Because of this and the small playing area, all free kicks represent a good opportunity to score. Penalties are awarded for fouls within the penalty area.

=== Other major differences from football ===
[[File:Beach soccer ball.jpeg|thumbnail|A beach soccer ball]]

* The ball is inflated to a lower pressure (0.4–0.6 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], compared to 0.6–1.1 atm in football)
* Instead of a throw-in, a team may choose to take a kick-in
* Preventing an opponent doing a [[bicycle kick]] is a specific foul
* Teams may not keep possession in their penalty area for more than four seconds

The '''[[California University of Pennsylvania]] Convocation Center''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[California, PA|California]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. The arena is the home of the [[California Vulcans]] men and women's basketball and volleyball teams, as well as the host of graduation commencement. The Convocation Center is able to host other sporting events, concerts, and trade shows, featuring a removable hardwood surface. The building, covering over 142,000 sq. feet, is the largest indoor venue between Morgantown, West Virginia, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Cal U Convocation Center is also home to the "Rivers Bend Conference Center," which features executive-level conferencing facilities. Also included in the venue are "smart" classrooms, configurable for large or small-group presentations, high-tech audio and visual systems, wireless Internet access, webcams, videoconferencing equipment, and interactive response systems. The building replaces the Vulcans previous basketball and volleyball arena, [[Hamer Hall (California University of Pennsylvania)|Hamer Hall]], which opened its doors in 1965.

== Construction and opening ==

[[Image:Convocation Center Graduation.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The first Undergraduate Commencement ceremony in the Convocation Center was held on December 17, 2011.]]
A ceremonial ground-breaking ceremony was held on August 5, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/washington/california-university-to-break-ground-for-convocation-center-350559/ "California University to break ground for convocation center"], ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', July 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The convocation center was constructed across from Hamer Hall in the area which previously served as the Hamer Parking Lot. While the University is looking for a sponsor for naming rights, the building has been officially deemed the "California University Convocation Center."  Dr. Angelo Armenti, President of Cal U, stated in the groundbreaking ceremony that the center "will be a landmark building for our campus,”and “Besides meeting the University’s needs, it will serve as a cultural resource and contribute to the economic vitality of Southwestern Pennsylvania.”

On August 3, 2010, a topping-off ceremony was held at the construction site to mark the placement of the final of the forty-six steel trusses on the building's frame.

Construction of the building took approximately two years and three months to complete. Construction has forced the closure of multiple streets, lots, and intersections, including the Hamer Parking Lot, Hamer Way, the intersection of Hamer and Third Street, the Third Street entrance to the river parking lot, as well as a two-year-old recreational basketball court. The Convocation Center's location had created a parking quagmire on campus, as construction of a new parking garage located behind the Manderino Library did not open until Fall of 2010, leaving a full year of school without enough parking on campus.

L. Robert Kimball &amp; Associates served as the architects and engineers for the project, while General Contracting was under the direction of The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company of Hershey, PA. Wayne Crouse, Inc. served as the HVAC Contractor, while WG Tomko, Inc. also served as the Plumbing Contractor. In addition, California University contracted A-1 Electrical Service of Venetia, PA and Ryco, Inc., as Electrical and Fire Protection Contractors, respectively.

The tight space the Convocation Center lies in between Hamer Hall, Gallagher Hall, and the railroad track forced construction equipment and staging areas to be moved behind the Morgan Learning Resource Center in the current "University Loop Road" area.

The Convocation Center officially opened for basketball action on December 3, 2011, with both the men's and women's teams defeating [[Mansfield University]]. The women won the opening game 79-52, while the men defeated the Mounties 91-65 in the second game of the doubleheader.

== Controversy ==
The project's large size had been questioned before construction began, including by a university consultant who recommended building the arena with 3,500 seats.&lt;ref name="size"&gt;Bill Schackner, [http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/washington/size-of-arena-raises-questions-635430/ "Size of California University of Pennsylvania arena raises questions"], ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', May 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  By April 2011 the university was reporting that construction costs on the center were $5.5 million over the original budget.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Schackner, [http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/washington/why-california-university-center-will-cost-55-million-more-292654/ "Why California University center will cost $5.5 million more"], ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', April 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  A "grand opening" concert by [[Kenny Rogers]] in April 2012 attracted only a half-capacity audience, leading to renewed questions about the scale and cost of the project.&lt;ref name="size"/&gt;  In May 2012, university president Angelo Armenti was fired by the [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]] Board of Governors; among the issues cited in reports of this action were concerns about the financing and financial impact of the convocation center.&lt;ref&gt;Taryn Luna, [http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/education/cal-u-president-armenti-fired-636359/?p=0 "CalU president Angelo Armenti fired"], ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', May 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan K.

In [[Abstract strategy games|abstract strategy]] [[board game]]s, '''candidate moves''' are moves which, upon initial observation of the position, seem to warrant further analysis. Although in theory the idea of candidate moves can be applied to games such as [[checkers]], [[Go (board game)|go]], and [[xiangqi]], it is most often used in the context of [[chess]].

== History ==
The idea of candidate moves was first put forth by [[International Grandmaster|Grandmaster]] [[Alexander Kotov]] in his book ''Think Like a Grandmaster''. In it, Kotov recommended looking for several moves that seemed feasible – the so-called candidate moves – and then analyzing those moves one at a time. Although this idea had been practiced by expert chess players for some time, it had never been explicitly articulated, and was relatively unknown to players at the amateur level.

The idea quickly caught on, and is now considered standard practice among chess players at all levels. Many beginning players are taught about candidate moves as soon as they learn to play the game, and there are numerous references to the idea in other chess books.

== Finding candidate moves ==
Finding the correct candidate moves is often one of the most difficult aspects of becoming a better chess player. Kotov, as well as other teachers, recommend using a system of [[pattern recognition]], looking at the elements of the current position to determine what might be a feasible move. For example, if a player notices that his opponent's [[King (chess)|king]] is on the [[Algebraic chess notation|g8 square]], and that his [[Knight (chess)|knight]] is on f3, then a candidate move might be '''Ng5''', a fairly common beginning to a [[Sacrifice (chess)|sacrifice]].

Once a player has found a good number of candidate moves (every position is different, although four to six moves is usually the norm), a player may then begin to systematically analyze these moves. The idea behind candidate moves is to help structure one's analysis and prevent it from becoming jumbled; inexperienced players who do not carefully consider candidate moves will often find themselves jumping between lines of analysis haphazardly.

== Computer chess ==
The ability of humans to find candidate moves remains one of the main differences between them and [[Computer chess|computers]]. Although early chess programmers made admirable efforts to make computers able to select candidate moves (see [[Computer chess#Brute force versus selective search|Type A versus Type B programs]]), they never played particularly well, and were soon supplanted by computers using [[Brute-force search|brute-force algorithms]] (Shenk, 2006). The addition of [[Alpha-beta pruning|Alphabeta]] algorithms made the latter type even more feasible. Many acknowledged that computers were simply not capable of performing the complex pattern recognition that was required to find appropriate candidate moves, and that it was easier to have computers perform simple exhaustive searches.

Today, most chess programs still rely mainly on brute-force searches, but as search algorithms have improved, today's [[chess engine]]s seem more and more to be using candidate moves in their analysis. [[Hydra (chess)|Hydra]], for example, is widely considered to be a "Type B" (candidate move finding) computer.

'''Ewa Kłobukowska''' (born 1 October 1946) is a former [[Poland|Polish]] [[sprint (running)|sprinter]]. She competed at the 1964 Olympics in the 4×100&amp;nbsp;m relay and 100&amp;nbsp;m sprint and won a gold and a bronze medal, respectively.&lt;ref name=sr&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/kl/ewa-klobukowska-1.html Ewa Kłobukowska]. sports-reference.com&lt;/ref&gt; She also won two gold and one silver medal at the 1966 European Championships. Kłobukowska set three world records, one in the 100&amp;nbsp;m (11.1&amp;nbsp;s, 9&amp;nbsp;July 1965 in [[Prague]]) and two in the 4×100&amp;nbsp;m relay (44.2&amp;nbsp;s, 13&amp;nbsp;September 1964, Lodz and 43.6&amp;nbsp;s, 21&amp;nbsp;October 1964, Tokyo). They were annulled by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) after she failed a gender identification test in 1967, though the test procedures were later found to be inadequate.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1258/jrsm.2008.080086|title=Intersex and the Olympic Games|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=101|issue=8|pages=395|year=2008|last1=Ritchie|first1=R.|last2=Reynard|first2=J.|last3=Lewis|first3=T.|pmc=2500237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Kłobukowska was born in a family of intellectuals. In 1965 she graduated from a Technical School of Economics No. 6 and in 1972 from the Warsaw School of Economics.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Intersex condition==
Kłobukowska failed a traditional gender test for European Cup women's track and field competition in [[Kiev]] in 1967 and was subsequently banned from competing in professional sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bjsm.25.1.17|pmid=1817477|pmc=1478807|title=Gender verification in sport: The need for change?|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=25|issue=1|pages=17–20|year=1991|last1=Ferguson-Smith|first1=M A|last2=Ferris|first2=E A}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[IAAF]] she had "one chromosome too many." Medical publications revealed that Klobukowska is a genetic mosaic of XX/XXY. If she had been tested one year later at the Mexico Olympics she would have been eligible on the grounds that she was [[Barr Body]] positive. Klobukowska has a Barr Body in all of her cells. Athletes without such a Barr Body (inactive X-chromosome) were suspended from competition by 1968 in Mexico City. Her humiliation led to a change in the gender verification policies by the [[International Olympic Committee]], which from then on kept test results secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Jaime|editor=Helen Jefferson Lenskyj|others=Stephen Wagg|title=The Palgrave Handbook of Olympic Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=buIzAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA449|accessdate=2 March 2015|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230367463|pages=443–60|chapter=Disciplining Sex: 'Gender Verification' Policies and Women's Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club takes part in the championship of Turkmenistan since 1992.

From the 1996 the name of the club added Eskavatorshik. In the winter break Championship 1997–98 club changed its name to Jeyhun.

Since 2002, the club was called Garagum. That year the team won the Cup of Turkmenistan, and among the leading players were [[Vitaly Alekperov]], [[Zarif Ereshev]], [[Yazguly Hodjageldiev]], [[Berdy Nurmuradov]], [[Nikolay Yermilov]] (goalkeeper, which reflected two penalties in the shoot-out in the Cup final).

In 2003 the team was suspected of intentional failure to check out the games, which is why the 2nd part of the championship club missed.

[[File:Frisbee 090719.jpg|thumb|A frisbee with the [[Wham-O]] registered trademark "Frisbee"]]
A '''frisbee''' (also called a '''flying disc''' or simply a '''disc''')&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Frisbee&lt;/ref&gt; is a gliding [[toy]] or [[Sports equipment|sporting item]] that is generally [[plastic]] and roughly {{convert|20|to|25|cm|in|0}} in [[diameter]] with a pronounced lip.  It is used recreationally and competitively for throwing and catching, as in [[flying disc games]]. The shape of the disc, an [[airfoil]] in cross-section, allows it to fly by generating [[lift (force)|lift]] as it moves through the air.  Spinning it imparts a stabilizing [[gyroscopic]] force, allowing it to be both aimed and thrown for distance.

A wide range of flying disc variants are available. Those for [[disc golf]] are usually smaller but denser and tailored for particular flight profiles to increase/decrease stability and distance. The longest recorded disc throw is by David Wiggins, Jr. with a distance of 338.0 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flying Disc World Records|url=http://wfdf.org/worldrecords/?r_sec=1|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Disc dog]] sports use relatively slow flying discs made of more pliable material to better resist a dog's bite and prevent injury to the dog. Flying rings are also available; they typically travel significantly farther than any traditional flying disc.  Illuminated discs for play after dark are made of [[Phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] plastic, contain [[chemiluminescence|chemiluminescent]] fluid, or battery-powered [[light-emitting diodes|LEDs]]. Others whistle when they reach a certain velocity in flight.

The term ''frisbee'' is a registered [[trademark]] of the [[Wham-O]] toy company.  While used [[genericized|generically]] in casual conversation to describe all flying discs, this protection results in organized sports such as [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]] or disc golf having to forgo the word.&lt;ref name="trademark-lost"&gt;[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm#6 Overview of Trademark Law: Can trademark rights be lost?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="losing-grip"&gt;[http://www.finnegan.com/resources/articles/articlesdetail.aspx?news=f2bab1ee-ca17-465b-afd5-0281d2b712f3 Losing Grip on the Frisbee]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Person throwing flying disc.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A flying disc in flight]]
[[File:Frisbee Catch- Fcb981.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A flying disc being caught]]

It is unknown when humans began tossing disc-shaped objects such as seashells or round stones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jim Palmeri|author2=Phil Kennedy |title=A Chain of Events, The Origin &amp; Evolution of Disc Golf|date=July 2015 |publisher=Wormhole Publishers |location=[[Wethersfield, CT]] |isbn=978-0-9774517-0-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but throwing the [[discus]] was an event in the organized [[Olympic Games]] of Ancient Greece.  The sport was resurrected and made part of modern [[track and field]] games, appearing at levels from high school to the modern Olympics.  Modern discs were made of weighted wood, surrounded by a protective metal band, and weighed several pounds.

[[Walter Frederick Morrison|Fred Morrison]] discovered a market for a light duty flying disc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=Fred |authorlink=Walter Frederick Morrison |author2=Phil Kennedy |title=Flat Flip Flies Straight! True Origins of the Frisbee |date=January 2006 |publisher=Wormhole Publishers |location=[[Wethersfield, CT]] |isbn=978-0-9774517-4-6 |oclc=233974379}}&lt;/ref&gt; that could be tossed recreationally in 1938 when he and future wife, Lucile, were offered 25 cents for a cake pan that they were tossing back and forth on a beach near Los Angeles, California. "That got the wheels turning, because you could buy a cake pan for five cents, and if people on the beach were willing to pay a quarter for it, well—there was a business," Morrison told ''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]'' newspaper in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=50 years later, Frisbee still flying high|url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/272111|accessdate=28 July 2013|newspaper=The Virginian-Pilot|author=Earl Swift|date=27 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morrisons continued their business until World War ll, when Morrison served in the Army Air Force, flying [[P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47s]], and then was a [[prisoner of war]]. Mustered out, Morrison sketched a design for an [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamically]] improved flying disc that he called the Whirlo-Way. By 1948, after design modifications and experimentation with several prototypes, Morrison and business partner Warren Franscioni began producing the first plastic discs, renaming them the Flyin-Saucer in the wake of reported [[unidentified flying object]]-sightings.

"We worked fairs, demonstrating it," Morrison told the ''Virginian-Pilot''. The two of them once overheard someone saying the pair were using wires to make the discs hover, so they developed a sales pitch: "The Flyin-Saucer is free, but the invisible wire is $1." "That's where we learned we could sell these things," he said, because people were enthusiastic about them.

Morrison and Franscioni ended their partnership in early 1950, and in 1954 Morrison formed his own company, called American Trends, to buy and sell Flyin Saucers, which were by then being made of a flexible polypropylene plastic by Southern California Plastics, the original molder. After learning that he could produce his own disc more cheaply, in 1955 Morrison designed a new model, the Pluto Platter, the archetype of all modern flying discs. He sold the rights to Wham-O on January 23, 1957, and in 1958 Morrison was awarded U.S. [[Design Patent]] D183,626 for his product.

In June 1957, Wham-O co-founders [[Richard Knerr]] and Arthur "Spud" Melin gave the disc the brand name "Frisbee" (pronounced "friz'-bee") after learning that Northeastern college students were calling the Pluto Platter by that term,&lt;ref name="CTV20070616"&gt;{{cite news |title='Frisbee' Marks 50th Anniversary of Name Change |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070616/frisbee_070616/20070616?hub=TopStories |publisher=[[CTVglobemedia]] |date=2007-06-16 |accessdate=2007-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101053740/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070616/frisbee_070616/20070616?hub=TopStories |archivedate=2007-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which derived from the name of the Connecticut-based pie manufacturer, [[Frisbie Pie Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/02/12/frisbee.morrison.obit/?hpt=T2 |publisher=CNN |title=Frisbee Inventor Dies at 90 - CNN.com |accessdate=2010-05-02 |date=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; a supplier of pies to [[Yale University]], where students had independently started a campus craze tossing empty pie tins stamped with the company's logo the way Morrison and his wife had in 1937.

In 1982, Morrison told ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine that he had received about US$2 million in royalty payments and said: "I wouldn't change the name of it for the world."&lt;ref name=latimes /&gt; By 1994 100 million Frisbees had been sold, yet by 2007 he had changed his tune: "I thought the name was a horror. Terrible," Morrison told ''[[The Press-Enterprise]]'' of [[Riverside, Connecticut|Riverside]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Walter Fredrick Morrison Dies at 90; Father of the Frisbee |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-fred-morrison13-2010feb13,0,7076853.story |accessdate=2010-02-14 |date=2010-02-13 |last=McLellan |first=Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown how many more millions he had made since 1982.

The man behind the Frisbee's success, however, was native Southern Californian Edward "Steady Ed" Headrick &lt;!-- (Pasadena, California, June 28, 1924 – La Selva Beach, California, August 12, 2002) --&gt;, hired in 1964 as Wham-O's new general manager and vice president in charge of marketing. Headrick soon redesigned the Pluto Platter by reworking the mold, mainly to remove the names of the planets, but in the process, fortuitously increasing the rim thickness and mass, creating a more controllable disc that could be thrown more accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=Fred |authorlink=Walter Frederick Morrison |author2=Phil Kennedy |title=Flat Flip Flies Straight! True Origins of the Frisbee |date=January 2006 |publisher=Wormhole Publishers |location=[[Wethersfield, CT]] |isbn=978-0-9774517-4-6 |oclc=233974379}} Fred Morrison: "Headrick had an eye for product design.... The "NEW LOOK" contributed mightily to its phenomenal success.... I've never known what financial arrangements Headrick had with [[Wham-O]]. It would have been interesting to know, but knowing wouldn't have changed anything. It was enough to know that under Headrick's guidance our increasing bank account was due to what he was doing."&lt;/ref&gt;

With the change in marketing strategy to promote Frisbee use as a new sport sales of the toy skyrocketed. In 1964, the first professional model went on sale. Its new design, patented by Headrick, featured raised ridges (the "Rings of Headrick") that were claimed to stabilize flight.&lt;ref name="About980218"&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa980218.htm The First Flight of the Frisbee: The History of the Frisbee]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his death, Headrick was [[cremation|cremated]], and, as requested by him, his ashes were molded into memorial discs and given to family and close friends&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6684592 "Edward 'Steady Ed' Headrick"] Find A Grave.&lt;/ref&gt; and sold to benefit The Ed Headrick Memorial Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discgolf.com/disc-golf-discs/steady-ed-memorial-discs/ Steady Ed Memorial Discs] Disc Golf Association&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthusiasts founded the International Frisbee Association in 1967, and the next year, the Frisbee Golf Tournament began in Kalamazoo. Also in 1967, some New Jersey teenagers invented [[Ultimate Frisbee]], a game that remains enthusiastically played today.  Still a popular toy as well as a sporting good, the Frisbee was inducted into the [[National Toy Hall of Fame]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wham-o.com/brands/frisbee_disc.html |title="Wham-O Frisbee Disc" |access-date=2015-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530150849/http://www.wham-o.com/brands/frisbee_disc.html |archive-date=2015-05-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disc sports==
{{Main|Flying disc games|Flying disc freestyle}}

The IFT [[guts (game)|guts]] competitions in Northern Michigan, the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships (1972), Toronto, ON, the Vancouver Open Frisbee Championships (1974), Vancouver, BC,  the Octad (1974), New Jersey, the American Flying Disc Open (1974), Rochester, NY and the World Frisbee Championships (1974), Pasadena, CA are the earliest Frisbee competitions that presented the Frisbee as a new disc sport. Before these tournaments, the Frisbee was considered a toy and used for recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Frisbee and Flying Disc freestyle|work=Development of Frisbee and disc sports|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/freestyle-history/#chapter3|accessdate=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Flying disc games#Double disc court|Double disc court]]
Double disc court was invented and introduced in the early 1970s by Jim Palmeri, a sport played with two flying discs and two teams of two players. Each team defends its court and tries to land a flying disc in the opposing court.

*[[Disc dog]]
Dogs and their human flying disc throwers compete in events such as distance catching and somewhat choreographed freestyle catching.

*[[Disc golf]]
This is a precision and accuracy sport in which individual players throw a flying disc at a target pole hole. In 1926, In Bladworth, Saskatchewan, Canada, Ronald Gibson and a group of his Bladworth Elementary school chums played a game using metal lids, they called "Tin Lid Golf." In 1976, the game of disc golf was standardized with targets called "pole holes" invented and developed by Wham-O's Ed Headrick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DDGA|title=History of Disc Golf|url=http://www.ddga.org/history-of-disc-golf/|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Flying disc games#Freestyle play and competition|Freestyle competition]]
In 1974, [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]] competition was created and introduced by [[Ken Westerfield]] and [[Discraft]]s Jim Kenner. Teams of two or three players are judged as they perform a routine that consists of a series of creative throwing and catching techniques set to music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=FPA|title=History of Frisbee and Flying Disc Freestyle|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/freestyle-history/#chapter3|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Goaltimate]]
A half-court disc game derived from Ultimate, similar to hot box. The object is to advance the disc on the field of play by passing, and score points by throwing the flying disc to a teammate in a small scoring area.

[[File:KanJam.jpg|thumb|248x248px|Man plays KanJam]]
*[[Guts (game)|Guts]]
The game of guts was invented by the Healy Brothers in the 1950s and developed at the International Frisbee Tournament (IFT) in [[Eagle Harbor, Michigan]]. Two teams of one to five team members stand in parallel lines facing each other across a court and throw flying discs at members of the opposing team.
     
*[[KanJam]]
A patented game scoring points by throwing and deflecting the flying disc and hitting or entering the goal. The game ends when a team scores exactly 21 points or "chogs" the disc for an instant win.

*[[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]]
The most widely played disc game began in the late 1960s with Joel Silver and Jared Kass. In the 1970s it developed as an organized sport with Johnny Appleseeds and the creation of the Ultimate Players Association by Dan Roddick, Tom Kennedy and Irv Kalb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Merit the Johnny Appleseeds|work=USA Ultimate Hall of Fame|url=https://www.usaultimate.org/assets/1/Page/The%20Johnny%20Appleseeds%202014.pdf|accessdate=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the game is to advance the disc and score points by eventually passing the disc to a team member in the opposing team’s end zone. Players may not run while holding the disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Ultimate Frisbee and Disc Sports|url=https://ultimatediscsport.com/|accessdate=December 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bottom of the 15th inning, the Mets loaded the bases against Braves [[relief pitcher]] [[Kevin McGlinchy]]. Mets [[catcher]] [[Todd Pratt]] drew a [[bases loaded]] [[base on balls|walk]], tying the score 3–3.

The next batter was Mets [[third baseman]] [[Robin Ventura]]. Ventura crushed the 2–1 pitch over the wall in right-center for an ostensible [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]], winning the game for the Mets and driving the Mets players and fans into a frenzied celebration. Ventura, however, never reached second base as Todd Pratt, the runner who was on first, picked up Ventura in celebration. Subsequently, Ventura was mobbed by his teammates, never finishing his trot around the bases. Because he failed to touch all four bases, the hit was officially scored a [[single (baseball)|single]]. [[Roger Cedeño]], the runner on third at the time, was ruled the only runner to have crossed home plate before the on-field celebration began and the Mets were awarded a 4–3 victory. Thus, Ventura was only credited with a [[single (baseball)|single]] and one RBI.

==Defining the "single"==
Sports books in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] were put into an unusual situation with the "single". If Ventura had completed his trip around the bases, the final score would have been 7–3, in which case the game would have gone "over" the [[over/under]] line, which was 7{{frac|1|2}}. Instead, the final score of 4–3 actually put the game "under", meaning that many bettors who would have received payouts (if the hit was ruled a home run) did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/1999/Oct-19-Tue-1999/sports/12177592.html|title=Ruling not a big hit with some bettors|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|author=Kevin Iole|date=October 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play remains as one of the most memorable moments in Mets postseason history. [[Orel Hershiser]], who played on the 1999 Mets remarked, "It will be right up there with [[Kirk Gibson]]'s home run (Hershiser was a teammate of Gibson with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] during their championship season of {{wsy|1988}}), [[Carlton Fisk]], [[Bucky Dent]].  This one will be on that tape with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/mlb/baseballs_best/mlb_bb_gamepage.jsp?story_page=bb_99nlcs_gm5_atlnym|title=1999 NLCS : Game 5|work=MLB.com|date=October 17, 1999|accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mets went on to lose the series to the Braves.

==Other instances of "grand slam singles"==
According to Baseball-Reference.com, there have been at least two other instances of "grand slam singles." Both occurred when a batter hit a grand slam but subsequently passed the runner ahead of him on the base paths, which according to the rules of [[Major League Baseball]] causes the runner who passes his teammate to be called out. This happened on July 9, 1970, when [[Dalton Jones]] of the [[1970 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] passed teammate [[Don Wert]] in a game against the [[1970 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], leaving him with a 3-RBI single.

It also occurred on July 4, 1976, when [[Tim McCarver]] of the [[1976 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] passed teammate [[Garry Maddox]] during a 10–5 win in the first game of a doubleheader against the [[1976 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], leaving him with a 3-RBI single. In both cases, the other three runs still counted because only the player who passes his teammate is called out. The three baserunners are able to score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Grand_Slam_Single|title=Grand Slam Single|work=Baseball-reference.com|accessdate=August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these hits took place with fewer than two outs.

Prior to 1920, if a batter hit a walk off home run, he would receive credit for advancing only as many bases as necessary for the winning run to score. Therefore, a walk-off grand slam in a tie game would have officially been scored as a single, and only one run would count. A review in the 1960s found 37 walk-off hits that would have been considered home runs under today's rules, but were instead ruled singles, doubles, or triples under the rules of the time. In April 1968, a committee voted to retroactively change these to home runs, but reversed their ruling a week later following public outrage about the decision extending [[Babe Ruth]]'s then-record to 715 home runs. It is unclear how many, if any, of these hits were singles that would have been grand slams under modern rules.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mlb.com/news/did-babe-ruth-hit-715-homers/c-280173404 Did Babe Ruth Hit 715 Homers?] MLB.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Had Ventura completed his trip around the bases, it would have been the first walk-off grand slam in MLB postseason history. That honor eventually went to [[Nelson Cruz]], whose 11th inning bases-loaded home run won game 2 of the [[2011 ALCS]] for the Texas Rangers over the Detroit Tigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/037xq|title=Postseason Batting Event Finder: 1903 to 2017, All Teams, Home Runs, Walk-off With Runners on 123|work=Baseball Reference |accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest definite reference to [[cricket]] is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (i.e., an [[Old Style and New Style dates|"Old Style"]] Julian date which is 1598 by modern reckoning under the [[Gregorian calendar]]). It is a deposition in the records of a [[legal case]] at [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], re the use of a parcel of land c.1550 and [[John Derrick]], a [[coroner]], testified that he had at that time played cricket on the land when he was a boy. Derrick's testimony makes clear that the sport was being played c.1550, but its true origin is a mystery. All that can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that its beginning was earlier than 1550, somewhere in south-east England within the counties of [[Kent]], [[Sussex]] and [[Surrey]]. Unlike other games with [[Batting (cricket)|batsmen]], [[Bowling (cricket)|bowlers]] and [[Fielding (cricket)|fielders]], such as [[stoolball]] and [[rounders]], cricket can only be played on [[cricket pitch|relatively short grass]], especially as [[cricket ball|the ball]] was [[delivery (cricket)|delivered]] along the ground [[pitched delivery bowling|until the 1760s]]. Therefore, forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play.

Although nothing is known of a "cricket season" ''per se'' in 1598, cricket was being played in the south-east of England at the time and so 1598 was the first season, as such, since the sport's earliest known reference. The sparse information available about the early years suggests that it may have been a children's game in the 16th century but, by 1611, it had become an adult pastime. The earliest known organised match was played circa 1611, a year in which other significant references to the sport are dated. From 1611 to 1725, fewer than thirty matches are known to have been organised between recognised teams. Similarly, only a limited number of players, teams and venues of the period have been recorded. The earliest matches played by English parish teams are examples of [[village cricket]]. Although village matches are now considered minor in status, the early matches are significant in cricket's history simply because they are known. There were no newspaper reports of matches until the end of the seventeenth century and so the primary sources are court records and private diaries, hence games were rarely recorded.&lt;ref name="matches" group="fc"&gt;Note that the information in this article is subject to change in the light of ongoing research. Surviving match records as late as 1825 are incomplete and, for example, any statistical compilation of a player's career to then can only be based on ''known'' data. Match [[scoring (cricket)|scorecards]] have survived from 1744 but were not always created, or have been lost, and the matches themselves were not always recorded in the press or other media. Well into the 19th century, scorecard data was not comprehensive: e.g., [[bowling (cricket)|bowling analyses]] lacked [[delivery (cricket)|balls bowled]] and [[run (cricket)|runs conceded]]; bowlers were not credited with [[wicket]]s when the [[batting (cricket)|batsman]] was [[caught]] or [[stumped]]; in many matches, the mode of [[dismissal (cricket)|dismissal]] was omitted.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, by circle of Jean Marc Nattier.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond]] was a leading patron of early cricket.]]
During the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], the gentry took an increased interest as patrons and occasionally as players. A big attraction for them was the opportunity that the game offered for [[gambling]] and this escalated in the years following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] when cricket in London and the south-eastern counties of England evolved into a popular social activity. The [[patronage|patrons]] staged lucrative eleven-a-side matches featuring the earliest [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|professional players]]. Meanwhile, English colonists had introduced cricket to North America and the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], and the sailors and traders of the [[East India Company]] had taken it to the [[Indian subcontinent]].

In the first quarter of the 18th century, more information about cricket became available as the growing newspaper industry took an interest. The sport noticeably began to spread throughout England as the century went on. By 1725, significant patrons such as [[Edwin Stead]], [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond]] and [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage]] were forming teams of county strength in [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] and [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]]. The earliest known great players, including [[William Bedle]] and [[Thomas Waymark]], were active. Cricket was attracting large, vociferous crowds and the matches were social occasions at which gambling and [[alcoholic drink]]s were additional attractions.

==Origins of cricket as a children's game==
[[File:EdwardII-Cassell.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Edward II (depicted in Cassell's ''History of England'') played ''creag'' in his youth.]]
The most widely accepted theory about the origin of cricket is that it first developed in early medieval times to the south and south-east of London in the geographical areas of the [[North Downs]], the [[South Downs]] and the [[Weald]].&lt;ref name=DU4&gt;{{cite book |last=Underdown |first=David |authorlink=David Underdown |title=Start of Play |year=2000 |publisher=Allen Lane |isbn=0-7139-9330-8 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey were therefore the earliest centres of excellence and it was from here that the game reached London, where its lasting popularity was ensured, and other southern counties like [[Berkshire]], Essex, [[Hampshire]] and [[Middlesex]]. As early as c.1611, a cricket match was recorded at [[Chevening]] in Kent between teams representing the Downs and the Weald.&lt;ref name=DU4/&gt;

A number of words in common use at the time are thought to be possible sources for the name "cricket". In the earliest known reference to the sport in 1598, it is called ''creckett''. Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the [[County of Flanders]] when the latter belonged to the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], the name may have been derived from the [[Middle Dutch]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Middle Dutch]] was the language in use in Flanders at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; ''krick''(''-e''), meaning a stick; or the [[Old English]] ''cricc'' or ''cryce'' meaning a crutch or staff.&lt;ref name=DB3&gt;{{cite book |last=Birley |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Birley |title=A Social History of English Cricket |year=1999 |publisher=Aurum |isbn=1-85410-710-0 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what may be an early reference to the sport, a 1533 poem attributed to [[John Skelton]] describes Flemish weavers as "kings of crekettes", a word of apparent Middle Dutch origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7919429.stm |first=Chris |last=Mason |title=Cricket was invented in Belgium |date=2 March 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''Dictionary of the English Language'' (1755), he derived cricket from "''cryce'', Saxon, a stick".&lt;ref name=HSA21&gt;{{cite book |last=Altham |first=H.

Cricket was probably devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game.&lt;ref name=HSA24&gt;Altham, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly it was derived from [[bowls]], assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a gate (e.g., a wicket gate), a stool or a tree stump as the wicket. The invention of the game could have happened in Norman or Plantagenet times anytime before 1300; or even in Saxon times before 1066.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On Cricket |last=Arlott |first=John |authorlink=John Arlott |last2=Trueman |first2=Fred |authorlink2=Fred Trueman  |year=1977 |publisher=BBC Books |isbn= |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All acknowledged subject experts and authorities agree that there is no evidence of cricket having evolved from another bat-and-ball sport and, equally, no evidence that any other bat-and-ball sport evolved from cricket. The authorities include writers [[Harry Altham]], [[John Arlott]], [[Derek Birley]], [[Arthur Haygarth]], [[David Underdown]], [[Roy Webber]] and [[Peter Wynne-Thomas]]. Their consensus view is that the only thing that can definitely be said about the origin of cricket is that its earliest record is in a late 16th-century court case in Surrey which proves it was played by children in southeast England in the middle of that century.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HSA21/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Major |first=John |authorlink=John Major |title=More Than A Game |year=2007 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn= |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DU3&gt;Underdown, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been alternative theories of origin but these have been dismissed or ignored by authorities. For example, the writer [[Andrew Lang]] claimed in 1912 that cricket evolved from a bat-and-ball game which may have been played in [[Dál Riata]] as early as the 6th century and this claim has been dismissed, by Anthony Bateman among others, in terms of "Lang's idiosyncratic belief in the [[Celts|Celtic]] origin of cricket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuroscience-arena.com/journals/pdf/papers/rsih_article.pdf |first=Anthony |last=Bateman |title=More Mighty Than The Bat, The Pen |publisher=British Society of Sports History |date=2003 |accessdate=12 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217220412/http://www.neuroscience-arena.com/journals/pdf/papers/rsih_article.pdf |archivedate=17 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is true that cricket is one of many bat-and-ball sports existing worldwide which have no known origin. Others are the definitely Celtic sports of [[hurling]] and [[shinty]]. [[Golf]] and [[hockey]] are other British ball games involving a club or stick while [[croquet]] was apparently imported from France and globally there are games such as Sweden's [[brännboll]], Italy's [[:it:Lippa (gioco)|lippa]], India's [[gilli-danda]], Finland's [[pesäpallo]] and Samoa's [[kilikiti]]. However, it is generally believed that cricket essentially belongs to the same family of bat-and-ball games as [[stoolball]], [[rounders]] and [[baseball]] but whether it evolved from any of these, or ''vice versa'', cannot be determined.&lt;ref name=HSA20&gt;Altham, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a 1523 reference to stoolball at a designated field in [[Oxfordshire]]; this may then have been a generic term for any game in which a ball is somehow hit with a bat or stick.&lt;ref name=RB261/&gt; 18th century references to stoolball in conjunction with cricket clearly indicate that it was a separate activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCann |first=Tim |authorlink=Timothy J.

==="Creag"===
On Thursday, 10 March 1300 ([[Julian calendar]]), wardrobe accounts of King [[Edward I of England]] included refunds to one John de Leek of monies that he had paid out to enable [[Edward II of England|Prince Edward]] to play "creag and other games" at both [[Westminster]] and [[Newenden]].&lt;ref name=HSA20/&gt; Prince Edward, the future Prince of Wales, was then aged 15. It has been suggested that "creag" was an early form of cricket.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; However, creag could have been something quite different.&lt;ref name=JM18&gt;Major, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Creag is possibly an early spelling of the word ''[[craic]]'' here taken as an Irish word meaning [[fun]], entertainment, or enjoyable conversation.&lt;ref name=L1597/&gt; This [[word sense|sense]] of the word ''crack'' is found in [[Irish English]], [[Scottish English]], and [[Geordie]] in [[North East England]]. In Ireland the spelling ''craic'' is now more common than ''crack''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] – "crack ([[noun]])" sense I.5.c.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest definite references===
[[File:RGS old building.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Royal Grammar School in Guildford where John Derrick was a pupil when he and his friends played "creckett" circa 1550.]]
The earliest definite reference to cricket being played anywhere in England (and hence anywhere in the world) is in evidence given at a 1597 [[legal case]], concerning ownership of a parcel of land, which confirms that it was played on [[common land]] in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], around 1550.&lt;ref name=HSA21/&gt; The court in Guildford heard on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date, equating to the year 1598 in the Gregorian calendar) from a 59-year-old [[coroner]], [[John Derrick]], who gave witness that when he was a scholar at the "Free School at Guildford", fifty years earlier, "hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play [on the common land] at creckett and other plaies", confirming that the sport was played there by schoolboys c.1550. It is perhaps significant that cricket is the only one of the "plaies" to be specifically named.&lt;ref name=JM19&gt;Major, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DU3/&gt;

In 1598, there was a reference to cricket in an Italian-English dictionary by [[John Florio|Giovanni Florio]]. His definition of the word {{lang|it|sgillare}} was: "to make a noise as a [[cricket (insect)|cricket]], to play ''cricket-a-wicket'', and be merry".&lt;ref name=Florio/&gt; Florio is the first writer known to have defined "cricket" in terms of both an insect and a game. In a later edition of his dictionary in 1611, Florio infers that "to play cricket-a-wicket" has sexual associations with references to ''{{not a typo|frittfritt}}'', defined "as we say cricket a wicket, or ''{{not a typo|gigaioggie}}''", and ''{{not a typo|dibatticare}}'', defined "to thrum a wench lustily till the bed cry ''{{not a typo|giggaioggie}}''".&lt;ref name=Florio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/florio/ |title=Queen Anna's New World of Words, f. 144 and f. 198 |date=1611 |first=Giovanni |last=Florio |accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The development of village cricket: 1611–1660==
===Beginning of adult participation===
[[File:Oliver Cromwell by Robert Walker.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Oliver Cromwell]] was the subject of the earliest definite reference to cricket being played in [[London]].]]
The first definite mention of cricket in [[Kent]] is deduced from a 1640 court case which recorded a "cricketing" of "the Weald and the Upland" versus "the Chalk Hill" at [[Chevening, Kent|Chevening]] "about thirty years since" (i.e., c.1611). This is the earliest known [[village cricket]] match; and the earliest known organised match in Kent, in England and in the world. Inter-parish contests became popular in the first half of the 17th century. As with the 1597 reference, the case concerned the land on which the game was played. The 1611 season as such was the fourteenth since the sport's earliest definite reference in 1597.&lt;ref name=DU4/&gt;

In 1611, a French-English dictionary was published by [[Randle Cotgrave]] who defined the noun ''crosse'' as "the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket"; the verb form of the word is ''crosser'', defined as "to play at cricket".&lt;ref name=HSA22/&gt;&lt;ref name=JM31&gt;Major, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Although cricket was defined as a boys' game in Cotgrave's dictionary, as per the Guildford schoolboys above, it was at this time that adult participation is known to have begun.&lt;ref name=L1597/&gt;

In 1613, a court case recorded that someone was assaulted with a "cricket staffe" at [[Wanborough, Surrey|Wanborough]], near Guildford.&lt;ref name=TJM1&gt;McCann, p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1616, [[John Bullokar]] referred to cricket in his ''[[An English Expositor]]'' as "a kind of game with a ball".&lt;ref&gt;Altham, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1617, the 18-year-old [[Oliver Cromwell]] is recorded as playing cricket and [[football]] in [[London]]. This is the earliest definite reference to cricket in London.&lt;ref name=HSA22&gt;Altham, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1624, a fatality occurred following a match on Saturday, 28 August, at [[Horsted Keynes]], now in [[East Sussex]]. A fielder called [[Jasper Vinall]] was struck on the head by the batsman, Edward Tye, who was trying to hit the ball a second time to avoid being [[caught]]. Vinall, who died thirteen days later at home in [[West Hoathly]], is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality. The matter was recorded in a [[coroner's court]], which returned a verdict of [[death by misadventure]].&lt;ref name=TJM2&gt;McCann, pp. xxxiii–xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The tragedy was repeated in 1647 when another fatality was recorded at [[Selsey]], now in West Sussex, a player called Henry Brand being hit on the head by a batsman trying to hit the ball a second time.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; When the first ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' were encoded in 1744, it was illegal to hit the ball twice and a batsman breaking the rule was to be given out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haygarth |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Haygarth |title=Scores &amp; Biographies, Volume 1 (1744–1826) |year=1862 |publisher=Lillywhite |isbn=1-900592-23-1 |page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record of the 1624 case confirms that two villages, Horsted Keynes and West Hoathly, were involved in the match and provides further evidence of the growth of village cricket.&lt;ref name=TJM2/&gt;

===Breaking the Sabbath===
The first definite mention of cricket in [[Sussex]] was in 1611 and relates to [[ecclesiastical court]] records stating that two parishioners of [[Sidlesham]], now in [[West Sussex]], had failed to attend church on [[Easter|Easter Sunday]] because they were playing cricket. They were fined 12 [[Penny (English coin)|pence]] each and made to do [[penance]], which meant confessing their guilt to the whole church congregation the following Sunday.&lt;ref name=DB7&gt;Birley, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The case is the first of several 17th century cricket references, until the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660, arising from [[Puritans|Puritan disapproval]] of recreational activity, especially on Sundays. These references indicate that inter-parish matches were being played but there is nothing to suggest that any [[county cricket|teams representative of counties]] were formed before the Restoration.&lt;ref name=OMC/&gt; There is no evidence of large scale gambling or patronage prior to the English Civil War and it was those factors which drove the formation of "representative" teams in the 18th century. It must be concluded, therefore, that the cricket being played before the war was of ''minor'' standard only: i.e., village cricket.&lt;ref name=OMC/&gt;

Puritan interference had become enough of a problem by 1617 for [[James VI and I|James I]] to issue the ''[[Declaration of Sports]]'' (also known as ''The Book of Sports'') which listed the sports and recreations that were permitted "on Sundays and other holy days". Initially, the declaration was effective in [[Lancashire]] only, partly as a reaction to Puritan suppression there of [[football]] (i.e., "mob football" in those days), blood sports and other activities which encouraged [[gambling]]. In 1618, the declaration was issued nationally and then reissued by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1633. Cricket is not mentioned, although its near relation [[bowls]] is on the prohibited list. The omission of cricket provides evidence as such that it was still an obscure regional activity.
The ''Declaration of Sports'' was strongly opposed by the Puritans, who were becoming increasingly influential. The purpose of the declaration was to rebuke the Puritans and prevent them from interfering in the people's lawful recreations. It had limited success until the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] began in 1642. The Puritans were by then in control of Parliament which closed the theatres and issued sanctions against other recreational activities although, again, there was no mention of cricket except when individual players were accused of "breaking the Sabbath". The ''Declaration of Sports'' manuscript was publicly burned by order of the Puritan Parliament in 1643.&lt;ref name=DB7/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Major, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1622, several parishioners of [[Boxgrove]], near [[Chichester]] in west Sussex, were prosecuted for playing cricket in a churchyard on Sunday, 5 May. There were three reasons for the prosecution: one was that it contravened a local bye-law; another reflected concern about church windows which may or may not have been broken; the third was that ''a little childe had like to have her braines beaten out with a cricket batt''!&lt;ref name=TJM1/&gt; The latter reason was because the rules at the time allowed the batsman to [[hit the ball twice]] and so fielding near the batsman was very hazardous, as the incidents involving Jasper Vinall and Henry Brand were to drastically confirm.

In 1628, an ecclesiastical case related to a game at [[East Lavant]], near [[Chichester]] in West Sussex, being played on a Sunday. One of the defendants argued that he had not played during evening prayer time but only before and after. It did him no good as he was fined the statutory 12d and ordered to do penance.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, pp. xxxiv–xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three further references before the Civil War. In a 1636 court case concerning a tithe dispute, a witness called Henry Mabbinck testified that he played cricket "in the Parke" at [[West Horsley]] in Surrey.&lt;ref name="RB262"/&gt; Another ecclesiastical case recorded parishioners of [[Midhurst]], West Sussex, playing cricket during evening prayer on Sunday, 26 February 1637 (i.e., Julian date).&lt;ref&gt;McCann, pp. xxxviii–xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1640, Puritan clerics at both [[Maidstone]] and [[Harbledown]], near [[Canterbury]], denounced cricket as "profane", especially if played on Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Underdown, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[English Civil War]] began in 1642, the [[Long Parliament]] banned theatres, as they had met with Puritan disapproval. Although similar action would be taken against certain sports, there is no evidence of cricket having been prohibited. Except that players must not "break the Sabbath", references to the game before and during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] suggest that it was approved; and Cromwell himself (see above) had been a player as a young man.

In 1654, three men were prosecuted at [[Eltham]] in Kent for playing cricket on a Sunday. As the Puritans were now firmly in power, Cromwell's [[Protectorate]] having been established the previous year, the penalty was doubled to 24 pence (two [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]]). The defendants were charged with "breaking the Sabbath", not with playing cricket. There is no evidence that cricket, unlike the theatres and other forms of entertainment, was banned by the Puritans.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when Cromwell's commissioners banned sport in Ireland two years later on the grounds of "unlawful assembly", there is no evidence that the ban included cricket, which had probably not reached Ireland by that time.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p. 267, records 1792 as the date of the earliest known match in Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puritan prejudice did not survive the Restoration. In 1671, a man called Edward Bound was charged with playing cricket on the Sabbath and was exonerated: evidence that attitudes had changed. The case was reported in [[Shere]], Surrey.&lt;ref name="JM31"/&gt;

===The beginning of amateur cricket===
The beginnings of cricket's social division between amateurs and professionals, from which the annual [[Gentlemen v Players]] contest ultimately evolved, can be traced to the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. In 1629, Henry Cuffin, a curate at [[Ruckinge]] in Kent, was prosecuted by an archdeacon's court for playing cricket on Sunday evening after prayers. He claimed that several of his fellow players were "persons of repute and fashion".&lt;ref name=B45&gt;Bowen, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DB7"/&gt; This statement is the first evidence of cricket achieving popularity among the gentry.&lt;ref name=B45/&gt;

It was the gentry who introduced large-scale [[gambling]] into cricket and some of these gamblers subsequently became [[patronage|patrons]] by forming select teams that would improve their chances of winning. During the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], gambling was, of political necessity, low key. The earliest reference to gambling on a cricket match is in the records of a 1646 court case concerning non-payment of a wager that was made on a game at [[Coxheath]] in Kent on Friday, 29 May that year. Curiously, considering the huge sums of money staked later in the century, this wager was for twelve candles, but the participants included members of the local gentry. The match at Coxheath is the earliest known example of an "odds" game as two Coxheath players were against four Maidstone players; the Coxheath II won. It was possibly a [[single wicket cricket|single wicket]] match and, if that could be proved, it would be the earliest on record.&lt;ref name=RB47&gt;Bowen, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1652, a case at [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook]] against John Rabson, Esq. and others referred to "a certain unlawful game called cricket". Rabson was evidently a member of the gentry but the other defendants were all working class.&lt;ref&gt;Underdown, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Cricket has long been recognised as a sport that bridged the class divide but, in time, the cricketing gentlemen came to be called "[[Amateur status in first-class cricket|amateurs]]" to emphasise the distinction between themselves and the professionals who belonged to the lower social classes, mostly to the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pp. 26–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The amateur became not merely someone who played cricket in his spare time but a particular type of top-class cricketer who existed officially until 1962, when the distinction between amateur and professional was abolished and all the then [[first-class cricket|first-class]] players became nominally professional. In terms of remuneration, amateurs claimed expenses for playing while professionals were paid a salary or fee.&lt;ref name=DB291&gt;Birley, p. 291–292.&lt;/ref&gt; Amateur cricket was an extension of the game played in schools, universities and other centres of education, both as a curricular and extracurricular activity. The schools and universities formed the "production line" that created nearly all the top-class amateur players.&lt;ref name=DB291/&gt;

[[File:John Churchill in his thirties.jpg|thumb|left|John Churchill as a young man. He played cricket at school in the 1660s.]]
There are few 17th century references to cricket being played at or in the vicinity of schools but, in 1647, a Latin poem contains a probable reference to cricket being played at [[Winchester College]]; if so, it is the earliest known mention of cricket in [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a reference to the game at [[St Paul's School, London]] c.1665 concerning [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]], who studied there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wisden |title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 100th edition |edition=1963 |editor-last=Preston |editor-first=Norman |editor-link=Norman Preston |publisher=Sporting Handbooks Ltd |location=London |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Social History of English Cricket'', Derek Birley comments that school cricket was "alive and well during the interregnum" (1649–1660). He speculates that the game "must have been known to every schoolboy in the south-east" of England. He doubts, however, that the sport at this time was part of any school's curriculum. Apart from [[Eton College]] and [[Westminster School]], all schools in the 17th century had local intakes and no class segregation. Therefore, the sons of rich and poor families played together.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; As evidenced by the legal cases of 1646 and 1652, described above, cricket was played jointly by gentry and workers.

The earliest reference to cricket at [[Oxford University]] is dated 1673.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maun |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Maun |title=From Commons to Lord's, Volume One: 1700 to 1750 |year=2009 |publisher=Roger Heavens |isbn=978-1-900592-52-9 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[John Phillips (author)|John Phillips]]' ''Duellum Musicum'', a 1673 pamphlet concerning music tuition, there is a criticism of his rival [[Thomas Salmon (musicologist)|Thomas Salmon]], who had boasted of being a graduate of [[Trinity College, Oxford]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"He shews but a slender sign of his University-Education: Where he seems to have spent his time rather in the more laudable Exercises of Trap and Cricket, than in any sound Reading".&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Depending on when Salmon graduated, it would seem that cricket was a normal activity at Oxford for some time before Phillips wrote his pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Martin |title=Rewriting History |year=2007 |publisher=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |work=The Cricket Statistician, no. 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was certainly well established at Oxford by October 1728 when the 19-year-old [[Samuel Johnson]] entered [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]]. He told [[James Boswell]] that cricket matches were played during the one year he was at Oxford and this was recorded by Boswell in his ''Life of Samuel Johnson''.&lt;ref&gt;Maun, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; A comment by [[Horace Walpole]] confirms that cricket was being played at [[Eton College|Eton]] during the first quarter of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Altham, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to cricket being played at [[Cambridge University]] is dated 1710 and both of those establishments were attended by [[William Goldwin]] who, in 1706, wrote a Latin poem of 95 lines on a rural cricket match. It was called ''In Certamen Pilae'' (On a Ball Game) and it was published in his ''Musae Juveniles''.&lt;ref name="Altham, pp. 24–25"&gt;Altham, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The development of important cricket: 1660–1700==
It was during the second half of the 17th century that, as Roy Webber put it, "the game took a real grip" especially in the south-eastern counties.&lt;ref name=W10&gt;{{cite book |last=Webber |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Webber |title=The Phoenix History of Cricket |year=1960 |publisher=Phoenix |isbn= |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobility withdrew to their country estates during the Commonwealth and were involved in village cricket as a pastime which, after the Commonwealth expired in 1660, they took with them when they returned to London.&lt;ref name=W10/&gt;

The Restoration of the monarchy in England in 1660 was immediately followed by the reopening of the theatres and sanctions imposed by the Puritans on sports were also lifted.&lt;ref name=OMC/&gt; Cricket was a leading entertainment and "it was ideal for a wager".&lt;ref name=OMC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html#restoration |title=From Lads to Lord's: Cricket Since the Restoration |first=John |last=Leach |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2007 |accessdate=10 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140259/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Rowland Bowen]], "it is likely that the Restoration was the crucial factor in leading to the social acceptance of the game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152818.html |title=Wisden 1965 : Cricket in the 17th and 18th centuries |last=Bowen |first=Rowland |authorlink=Rowland Bowen |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |date=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are only scattered references to the game in the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], it is clear that its popularity was increasing and that it was expanding.&lt;ref name=B11&gt;Birley, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Restoration was effectively completed during the spring of 1660 and, in the general euphoria which both accompanied and followed these historic events, gambling on cricket and other sports was freely pursued.&lt;ref name=B11/&gt; The large amounts at stake led some investors to try to improve their chances of winning by forming teams that were stronger than the typical parish XI.&lt;ref name=OMC/&gt; By now, the nobility had adopted cricket as one of their main sports along with [[horse racing]] and [[bare-knuckle boxing|prizefighting]].&lt;ref name=W10/&gt; This was the beginning of the patronage that sustained and controlled cricket through the 18th century.&lt;ref name=OMC/&gt; The first teams representing several parishes and even whole counties were formed in the 1660s and the period saw the first "great matches" as cricket evolved into a major sport.&lt;ref name=HSA23&gt;Altham, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant aspect of this evolution was the introduction of [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|professionalism]].&lt;ref name=OMC/&gt; Members of the nobility who returned to London after the Restoration were keen to develop cricket and brought with them some of the "local experts" from village cricket whom they now employed as professional players.&lt;ref name=HSA23/&gt; Within a year or two of the Restoration, "it became the thing in London society to make matches and form clubs".&lt;ref name=HSA23/&gt; A kind of "feudal patronage" was established as the nobility took control of the sport, their interest fuelled by the opportunities for gambling that it provided, and this set the pattern for cricket's development through the next century.&lt;ref name=HSA23/&gt; Consequently, there was a significant rise in standards of play to the level that is now termed [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important]].&lt;ref name="status" group="fc"&gt;[[First-class cricket]] was officially defined in May 1894 by a meeting at [[Lord's]] of [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) and the [[county cricket|county clubs]] which were then competing in the [[County Championship]]. The ruling was effective from the beginning of the 1895 season. Pre-1895 matches of the same standard have no official definition of status because the ruling is not retrospective and the [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match]] designation, as applied to a given match, is based on the views of one or more substantial historical sources. For further information, see [[First-class cricket]], [[Forms of cricket]] and [[History of cricket]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gaming Act 1664 was passed by the "Cavalier" Parliament to try and curb some of the post-Restoration excesses.&lt;ref name=L64&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html#1661 |title=From Lads to Lord's: 1664 |first=John |last=Leach |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2007 |accessdate=10 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140259/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It limited stakes to £100 which was in any case a fortune at the time,&lt;ref name=B11/&gt; equivalent to about £{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|100|1664|r=-3}}}} in present-day terms.{{inflation-fn|UK}} It is known that cricket could attract stakes of 50 guineas by 1697 and it was funded by gambling throughout the next century.&lt;ref name=FL18C1&gt;{{cite book |last=Buckley |first=G.

[[File:Richgreen.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Cricket was played on Richmond Green in 1666.]]
The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]] which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry.&lt;ref name=L96&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html#1693 |title=From Lads to Lord's: 1696 |first=John |last=Leach |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2007 |accessdate=10 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140259/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. In May 1666, [[Robert Paston, 1st Earl of Yarmouth|Sir Robert Paston]] of [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] wrote a letter to his wife mentioning "a game of criquett (''sic'') on Richmond Green" which is the first reference to cricket at [[Richmond Green cricket ground|Richmond Green]], a popular venue for important matches during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name=L66&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html#richmond |title=From Lads to Lord's – Richmond Green |last=Leach |first=John |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2007 |accessdate=11 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140522/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a significant development at Maidstone on Saturday, 28 March 1668 when the [[quarter session]]s made a ruling that [[HM Customs and Excise|customs and excise]] could not claim [[excise|excise duty]] on alcoholic drinks sold at a "kricketing"; it was further ruled that a match promoter had the right to sell ale to spectators, presumably after obtaining the necessary licence. As John Major suggested, this dealt a massive blow to "Puritan morality", and it could have been the beginning of the long-term relationship between sport and alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Major, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Derek Birley's comment on the excise ruling was that cricket's "connection with [[pub|public houses]] is historic in every sense of the word". In his view, the sport had "arrived" because the [[brewery]] trade was the earliest and strongest [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] of popular sport.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1677, accounts of [[Thomas Lennard, 1st Earl of Sussex]], include an item which refers to £3 being paid to him when he went to a cricket match being played at "ye Dicker", which was a common near [[Herstmonceux]] in East Sussex.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. xl.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1678, there was mention of cricket as "a play" (presumably in the sense of a sport that is played) in a Latin dictionary published by Dr [[Adam Littleton]]. In 1694, accounts of Sir John Pelham record 2s 6d paid for a wager concerning a cricket match at [[Lewes]].&lt;ref name=TJM3&gt;McCann, p. xli.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mitcham Cricket Club]] was formed in 1685, the club playing on what is today known as [[Mitcham Cricket Green]]. The site has hosted cricket matches ever since.&lt;ref name=PhilShaw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020713/ai_n12629473 |title=Cricket: After 400 years, history is made next to the A323 |first=Phil |last=Shaw |publisher=The Independent |date=13 July 2003 |accessdate=6 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006000955/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020713/ai_n12629473 |archivedate= 6 October 2007 |df= }} Quote: "Mitcham Green has been in continual use as a cricket venue for 317 years".&lt;/ref&gt; Mitcham is believed to be the world's oldest cricket club as there is no evidence of any club being founded before 1685. [[Croydon Cricket Club|Croydon]], [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] and [[London Cricket Club|London]] had all been founded by the 1720s but their dates of origin have been lost, although there was an actual reference to a London Club in 1722.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to ''The Weekly Journal'' (London) dated 21 July 1722.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Artillery Ground in 2008.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Artillery Ground]] photographed in 2008.]]
London Cricket Club was to become chiefly associated with the [[Artillery Ground]] in [[Finsbury]]. This venue was first mentioned re cricket on Friday, 7 May 1725, when the minutes of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] referred to its being used for cricket: there is a note which concerns "the abuse done to the herbage of the ground by the cricket players".&lt;ref name=IM3031&gt;Maun, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Artillery Ground became the feature venue for cricket in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Altham, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1695, Parliament decided against a renewal of the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662|1662 Licensing Act]] and so cleared the way for [[Freedom of the press|a free press]] on the Act's expiry in 1696. Censorship had already been relaxed following the [[Bill of Rights 1689]]. It was from this time that cricket matters could be reported in the newspapers, but it would be a very long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone comprehensive, reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/pp428-435 |title=Charles II, 1662: An Act for preventing the frequent Abuses in printing seditious treasonable and unlicensed Bookes and Pamphlets and for regulating of Printing and Printing Presses |publisher=British History Online |work=Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5 |date=1628–80 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known newspaper report of a "great match" was in the ''Foreign Post'' dated Wednesday, 7 July 1697:&lt;ref name=FL18C1/&gt;&lt;ref name=TJM3/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The middle of last week (i.e., probably on Wednesday, 30 June 1697) a great match at cricket was played in Sussex; there were eleven of a side, and they played for fifty guineas apiece".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A historically significant event which is recorded by numerous sources, starting with [[G. B. Buckley]] in his ''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket'', it is the world's earliest known [[first-class cricket|important cricket match]] (possibly [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]] v [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] or [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]]) and, as Buckley said, "the earliest record of an eleven a side match".&lt;ref name=FL18C1/&gt; The stakes on offer confirm the importance of the fixture and the fact that it was eleven-a-side suggests that two strong and well-balanced teams were assembled.&lt;ref name=TJM3/&gt; No other details were given but the report provides real evidence to support the view that "great matches" played for high stakes were in vogue in the years following the Restoration.&lt;ref name=L97/&gt; Given the Sussex venue, [[Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond]] may have been one of the patrons involved.&lt;ref name=L97&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html#1697 |title=From Lads to Lord's: 1697 |date=2007 |first=John |last=Leach |publisher=Stumpsite |accessdate=28 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140259/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the decision of the English government in 1695 to allow freedom of the press (i.e., they decided not to renew the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]] which had inhibited the scope of publications), it was possible for sporting events to be reported; however, it was a long time before editors gave sport any priority so coverage remained low key and infrequent for several decades. The 1697 match occurred in the 100th season since cricket's earliest definite reference in 1597.

Periodicals called ''The Post Boy'' and ''The Post Man'' were in circulation during the early 18th century. In 1700, a series of ten-a-side matches to be held on [[Clapham Common]], near [[Vauxhall]], was pre-announced on Saturday, 30 March, by ''The Post Boy''. The first was to take place on Easter Monday, 1 April, and prizes of £10 and £20 were at stake. No match reports could be found so the results and scores remain unknown. The advert says the teams would consist of ten "Gentlemen" per side but the invitation to attend was to "Gentlemen and others". This clearly implies that cricket had achieved both the patronage that underwrote it through the 18th century and the spectators who demonstrated its lasting popular appeal. As the event involved "gentlemen only", it was probably minor in quality but is nevertheless the earliest known organised match in the county of [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=W4&gt;{{cite book |last=Waghorn |first=H.

==Rules and equipment of early cricket==
Early [[cricket]]ers played in their everyday clothes and had no protective equipment such as gloves or pads. A 1743 painting of a game in progress at the [[Artillery Ground]] depicts two [[batting (cricket)|batsmen]] and a [[bowling (cricket)|bowler]] dressed alike in white shirt, breeches, white knee-length stockings and shoes with buckles. The [[wicket-keeper]] wears the same clothes with the addition of a waistcoat. An [[umpire (cricket)|umpire]] and [[Scoring (cricket)|scorer]] wear three-quarter length coats and tricorn hats. Apart from the shirts and stockings, none of the clothes are white and no one wears pads or gloves. The [[cricket ball|ball]] is bowled [[underarm bowling|underarm]] along the ground, as in [[bowls]], at varying speed towards a [[wicket]] consisting of two [[stump (cricket)|stumps]] mounted by a single [[Bail (cricket)|crosspiece]]. The batsman addresses the delivery with a [[cricket bat|bat]] that resembles a modern [[hockey stick]], this shape being ideal for dealing with a ball on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;The painting is [[Francis Hayman]]'s ''Cricket at the Artillery Ground'', 1743. It hangs at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern straight bat evolved in the 1760s after [[Pitched delivery bowling in cricket|bowlers began to "give the ball air" by pitching it]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1751.html#bowling |title=From Lads to Lord's – The first bowling revolution |last=Leach |first=John |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2007 |accessdate=11 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140122/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1751.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, "the game changed completely and evolved from its [[Pioneering phase (cricket)|pioneering phase]] into what may be termed its pre-modern phase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1751.html#bowling |title=From Lads to Lord's – 1760 |last=Leach |first=John |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2007 |accessdate=11 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140122/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1751.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oldest cricket bat.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The [[cricket bat]] of the 1720s was shaped like a modern [[hockey stick]] so that it could address a ball that was not pitched.]]
The record of the 1622 case at Boxgrove contains the earliest reference to the [[cricket bat]]. The term "batt" in cricket was peculiar to Kent and Sussex, where coastal smugglers were known as "batmen" because of the cudgels they carried. The earliest reference to a "flat-faced" bat (i.e., with a flat surface at the bottom of the stick in [[ice hockey]] style) also occurs in 1622.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Martineau |first=G. D. |title=Bat, Ball, Wicket and All |publisher=Sporting Handbooks |year=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "bat" remained comparatively rare until about 1720. The terms in more general use were "staff", "stave" or "stick". These tended to have regional usage: for example, "stave" was used in the Gloucester area and "batt" in the south-east; while "staff" and especially "stick" were more widely used.&lt;ref name=Terry/&gt; "Bat" is derived from the French "battledore", shaped like a table tennis bat, which was used by washerwomen to beat their washing with.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of English – "battledore".&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest reference to the [[cricket ball]] is found in 1658 in ''Mysteries of Love and Eloquence'' by [[Edward Phillips]].&lt;ref name=HSA22/&gt; The [[cricket pitch|pitch]] has been 22 yards long (i.e., a [[Chain (unit)|chain]]) since the first known code of Laws in 1744&lt;ref name=Wisden&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153476.html |title=Dates in Cricket History |publisher=Wisden Cricketer's Almanack |date=1978 |accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is believed this length had been in use since the introduction of [[Gunter's chain]] in 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLbo4sr-xfwC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=gunter's+chain+cricket+pitch&amp;source=web&amp;ots=DMpgOZyCXJ&amp;sig=V5xqhjHTB41AUBxFVAmny5OAlFg&amp;hl=en |title=Australian Popular Culture |last=Craven |first=Ian, Martin Gray and Geraldine Stoneham | work=British Australian Studies Association |date=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press Popular Culture |isbn=0-521-46667-9 |page=27 |accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Over (cricket)|over]] consisted of four deliveries until the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Wisden/&gt;

The earliest known reference to the [[wicket]] is contained in lines written in an old bible in 1680 which invited "All you that do delight in Cricket, come to [[Marden, West Sussex|Marden]], pitch your wickets".&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Marden is in West Sussex, north of Chichester, and close to [[Hambledon, Hampshire|Hambledon]], which is just across the county boundary in Hampshire. The wicket until the 1770s comprised two stumps and a single bail. By that time, the shape of the wicket was high and narrow after the 1744 Laws defined the dimensions as 22&amp;nbsp;inches high and six inches wide. But earlier 18th century pictures show a wicket that was low and broad, perhaps two feet wide by one foot high. The ends of the stumps were forked to support the light bail and there were criteria for the firmness of pitching the stumps into the ground and for the delicate placing of the bail so that it would easily topple when a stump was hit.&lt;ref name=Terry/&gt;

There has been a lot of conjecture about the origin of the wicket, but suffice to say that the 17th century outline shape is more akin to the profile of a church stool, which is low and broad. Furthermore, the legs of the stool were called stumps, which adds further credence to the idea that stools were used as early wickets.&lt;ref name=Terry/&gt; According to the ''Churchwarden's Accounts for Great St. Mary's Church of Cambridge'' (1504–1635), a church stool was sometimes known in the south-east by the Dutch name of "kreckett", this being the same word used for the game by John Derrick in 1597.&lt;ref name=Terry/&gt;

The earliest known mention of the [[umpire (cricket)|umpire]] dates from 1680 and is the first entry in Buckley's ''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket''. Buckley does not quote the reference "that is quite unfit for publication nowadays" but he confirms a clear reference to "the two umpires" and that the double wicket form of the game was already well known in London. It is also the first mention of cricket in the county of [[Middlesex]].&lt;ref name=FL18C1/&gt;

There were two main [[forms of cricket]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. One was [[single wicket cricket|single wicket]] in which, as the name implies, there is only one batsman, although teams of threes or fives often took part. The converse is the "double wicket" form, with two batsmen, and this has long been associated with eleven-a-side teams playing two innings each and it is these games which, depending on the teams involved, have [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match status]].&lt;ref name=ACS4&gt;{{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709 – 1863 |year=1981 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn= |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although single wicket was in vogue through the period of this history, the earliest ''definite'' record of a single wicket match is in 1726, so it is out of scope in this article.&lt;ref name=IM33/&gt;

In early cricket, there were two [[Umpire (cricket)|umpires]] as now, but the modern square-leg umpire stood close to the striker's wicket. Both umpires carried a bat which the running batsman was required to touch in order to complete his run.&lt;ref&gt;Altham, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; There were two [[scorer]]s who sat on the field and recorded the scores by making notches on tallysticks; runs were then known as notches for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;Altham, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English cricket in the early 18th century==
===Patrons===
[[File:Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond and Lennox by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond.]]
On an unknown date in 1702, the [[1st Duke of Richmond's XI cricket team|1st Duke of Richmond's XI]] defeated an [[Arundel Cricket Club|Arundel XI]] at an unspecified venue in Sussex. The source for this game is a receipt sent by one Saul Bradley to the Duke on Monday, 14 December 1702. The receipt was for one [[shilling]] and six [[pence]] paid by the Duke "for brandy when your Grace plaid at Cricket with Arundel men". It is thought the brandy was bought to celebrate a victory. The venue was probably either [[Goodwood House|Goodwood]], where Richmond had his estate, or [[Arundel]], possibly on [[Bury Hill, Arundel|Bury Hill]] which was used for cricket in later years. Arundel was a prominent centre of cricket in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1st Duke of Richmond died in 1723, his son [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond]], quickly succeeded him as cricket's main benefactor and became a famous patron of Sussex cricket for the next thirty years. The 2nd Duke enjoyed a friendly rivalry with his friend [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage]], another Sussex patron. Their teams played each other many times and their earliest known contest was on Tuesday, 20 July 1725, five days after Sir William's team was beaten by unknown opponents. Richmond wrote to Gage in early July 1725 and issued a challenge for a match to be played at [[Goodwood House|Goodwood]]. Gage replied to him by letter on 16 July and confirmed that his team would play the Duke's on Tuesday, 20 July. Gage then stated that he is "in great affliction from being shamefully beaten yesterday (Thursday, 15 July 1725) the first match I played ys (''sic'') year". He went on to wish the Duke success in everything except his cricket match. The game on 20 July was actually played at [[Bury Hill, Arundel]] and Richmond's team won by "above forty (runs)". The report in the ''Daily Journal'' newspaper on Wednesday, 21 July, confirms Bury Hill (then called Berry Hill), near Arundel, as the venue. The match, played before "a vast Concourse of People", was hosted by [[Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk]] who gave a ball at [[Arundel Castle]] in the evening. 1725 was English cricket's 128th season since the sport's earliest definite reference in 1597.&lt;ref name=TJM19&gt;McCann, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IM31&gt;Maun, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main rival to Richmond and Gage was [[Edwin Stead]] of Maidstone, who was the first of the noted Kent patrons. The Sussex teams of Richmond and Gage enjoyed an inter-county rivalry with Stead's Kent that could have originated the concept of the [[County Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The terms of the wager===
The patrons ensured that cricket was financed in the 18th century but their interest, equally applicable to horse racing and prizefighting, was based on the opportunities that cricket provided for gambling. Every important match in the 18th century, whether eleven-a-side or single wicket, was played for stakes. The early newspapers recognised this and were more interested in publishing the odds than the match scores. Reports would say who won the wager rather than who won the match.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, gambling would lead to dispute and two matches ended up in court when rival interests sought legal rulings on the terms of their wagers. On Monday, 1 September 1718, a game on [[White Conduit Fields]] in [[Islington]] between [[London Cricket Club|London]] and the [[Rochester Punch Club cricket team|Rochester Punch Club]] was unfinished because three Rochester players "made an elopement" in an attempt to have the game declared incomplete so that they would retain their stake money. London was clearly winning at the time. The London players sued for their winnings and the game while incomplete was the subject of a noted lawsuit in which the terms of the wager were at issue. The court ordered that the match must be "played out" and this happened in early July 1719 (the exact date is uncertain but it was before the 4th). Rochester with four wickets standing needed thirty more runs to win but were all out for 9. It is not certain if 30 was their overall target or if they needed thirty more in addition to runs scored in the original encounter; equally, it is not known if 9 was the innings total they achieved or if they added nine more to their "overnight" score. London's 21-run victory is the earliest known definite result of any cricket match. The match is the earliest known mention of White Conduit Fields as a venue.&lt;ref name=ACS19/&gt;&lt;ref name=FL18C2&gt;Buckley (FL18C), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1724 (exact date unknown), [[Edwin Stead's XI cricket team|Edwin Stead's XI]] v [[Chingford Cricket Club|Chingford]] ended early because the Chingford team refused to play to a finish when Stead's team had the advantage. Another court case followed. It is known that [[John Pratt (judge)|Lord Chief Justice Pratt]] presided over the case and ordered them, as in the London v Rochester match in 1718, to play it out so that all wagers could be fulfilled. Pratt "referr'd the said Cause back to [[Dartford Heath]], to be played on where they left off, and a Rule of Court was made accordingly".&lt;ref name=IM33&gt;Maun, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The game was completed in 1726. The final result is not on record, and there is no confirmation that Stead's team held their advantage and won.&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; This match is the earliest reference to cricket being played in [[Essex]], if [[Chingford]] was the original venue, though it is assumed to have been Dartford Brent. It is certainly the first match known to have involved an [[Essex county cricket teams|Essex team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/histories/matches.html |title=Classification of cricket matches from 1697 to 1825 |last=Leach |first=John |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2008 |accessdate=11 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140003/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/histories/matches.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of [[Articles of Agreement (cricket)|articles of agreement]], agreed before matches by the stakeholders, largely resolved any problems between patrons and match organisers. The concept was more important in terms of defining the rules of play and eventually these were codified as the ''Laws of Cricket''.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matches of the early 18th century===
On Tuesday, 24 July 1705, ''The Post Man'' announced [[East and West Kent cricket teams|West of Kent]] v [[Chatham Cricket Club|Chatham]], an 11-a-side game to be played in Kent on Tuesday, 7 August. The primary source gives the venue as "Maulden" which must have been a typeset error as there is no such place. It was possibly [[Maidstone]] or [[West Malling|Malling]]. The title "West of Kent" suggests a team representative of several parishes, so this is arguably the earliest known [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match]] in Kent. There were several matches throughout the 18th century involving teams called "West Kent" and "East Kent". Chatham was a prominent centre of cricket in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=W4/&gt;&lt;ref name=IM7&gt;Maun, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday, 26 June 1707, there was a [[London Cricket Club|London]] v [[Mitcham Cricket Club|Mitcham]] match at [[Lamb's Conduit Field]], [[Holborn]]. The result is unknown. This is the earliest known [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match]] in [[Middlesex]] and possibly the earliest known to involve the original London Cricket Club, though the date of the club's formation is uncertain and the team here might have been an ''ad hoc'' London XI. In contrast to the "[[Non-international England cricket teams|all England]]" term used later in the century, the source calls the team "all London". Mitcham Cricket Club, which is extant, was founded in 1685.&lt;ref name=IM9&gt;Maun, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday, 1 and Tuesday, 8 July 1707, [[Croydon Cricket Club|Croydon]] played London twice, the first game played in Croydon, probably at [[Duppas Hill]], and the second at [[Lamb's Conduit Field]] in [[Holborn]]. Both matches were advertised by ''The Post Man'' as "two great matches at cricket (to be) plaid, between London and Croydon; the first at Croydon on Tuesday, 1 July, and the other to be plaid in Lamb's-Conduit-Fields, near Holborn, on the Tuesday following, being the 3rd (''sic'') of July". No post-match reports could be found so the results and scores are unknown. The match in Croydon is the earliest known [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match]] in [[Surrey]]. As with the previous match, it is not known if the teams at this time represented formally constituted clubs and it is possible that both were ''ad hoc'' teams drawn from local residents. Croydon and London both had important teams in the first half of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=W5&gt;Waghorn, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACS19&gt;ACS, ''Important Matches'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The match in Holborn was a return to the one on 1 July. There has been some confusion about the date of the second match following a misreading of the original source by [[H. T. Waghorn]], who was the first modern researcher, but Tuesday, 8 July is believed to be correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Martin |title=An Index to Waghorn |publisher=Bodyline |year=2005 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday, 23 June 1708, a local match took place somewhere in the [[Canterbury]] area and was recorded in the diary of one Thomas Minter, a Canterbury resident, who wrote: "We beat Ash Street at Crickets (''sic'')". Although this was probably a minor match only, it illustrates the popularity of cricket in Kent.&lt;ref name=W4/&gt;&lt;ref name=IM10&gt;Maun, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known match that definitely involved county teams, or teams using the names of counties, was [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] v [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] at [[Dartford Brent]] on Wednesday, 29 June 1709. This was advertised in the ''Post Man'' the previous Saturday and played for a stake of £50.&lt;ref name=ACS19/&gt;&lt;ref name=FLPVC1&gt;{{cite book |last=Buckley |first=G. B. |authorlink=G. B. Buckley |title=Fresh Light on pre-Victorian Cricket |year=1937 |publisher=Cotterell |isbn= |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this time, in the 112th season since the sport's earliest definite reference in 1597, there are references to counties in use as team names although it is generally believed that the earliest "inter-county matches" were really inter-parish matches involving two villages on either side of a county boundary. [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] was an important club in the first half of the 18th century and its team at this time featured [[William Bedle]]. The match is the earliest known mention of Dartford Brent as a venue.&lt;ref name=FLPVC1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maun, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

One player who could have taken part in the 1709 match was [[William Bedle]] (1680–1768), of Dartford, who is the earliest great player whose name has been recorded. He was "reckoned to be the most expert player in England" and must have been in his prime c.1700 to c.1725.&lt;ref name="Buckley FL18C, p. 48"&gt;Buckley (FL18C), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Other good players known to have been active in the 1720s were Edwin Stead of Kent; [[Edmund Chapman]] and [[Stephen Dingate]] of Surrey; [[Tim Coleman (18th century cricketer)|Tim Coleman]] of London; and [[Thomas Waymark]] of Sussex.

Village cricket continued to thrive in the 18th century. On Friday, 31 May 1717, Thomas Marchant, a farmer from [[Hurstpierpoint]] in Sussex, first mentioned cricket in his diary. He made numerous references to the game, particularly concerning his local club, until 1727. His son Will played for "our parish", as he often called the Hurstpierpoint team. In total, his diaries mention 21 village matches and the entries provide evidence of the widespread popularity of cricket in Sussex.&lt;ref name=TJM1717&gt;McCann, pp. 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is from the 1717 season that a continuous history of English cricket by season is possible. Records of cricket have survived from every season after 1716, although the details in most seasons through the 18th century remain sparse.

===Dartford v London===
The first great rivalry in cricket history was between the [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] and [[London Cricket Club|London]] clubs who are first known to have played each other in 1722. London played some matches against [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] but the county side is believed to have largely consisted of Dartford players. On Wednesday, 19 August 1719, London v Kent was played at [[White Conduit Fields]] and Kent won. The report said the teams played for "a considerable sum of money". There is an insight into the priorities of early 18th century cricketers as the contemporary report concludes with: "The Kentish men won the wager" (i.e., the wager was more important than the match).&lt;ref name=W5/&gt;

On Saturday, 9 July 1720, London v Kent at White Conduit Fields was won by London.&lt;ref name=ACS19/&gt; In this match, two London [[fielding (cricket)|fielders]] were badly injured by a clash of heads.&lt;ref name=W5/&gt; [[H. T. Waghorn]] noted a lull in the advertising and reporting of cricket after this game and he wondered if that was due to a perception that the sport was dangerous.&lt;ref name=W5/&gt; If there was a lapse in cricket at this time, the more likely causes would be either: (a) the [[South Sea Bubble]] which ruined many investors and so could have reduced cricket patronage; or (b), as Waghorn himself mentions, "the (news)papers were small, and space limited, the advertising and reporting (of) matches ceased". The [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] may have had an economic impact on investment and gambling as, when the South Sea Company was found to be insolvent, its crash in 1720 caused massive repercussions throughout the economy and many formerly prosperous investors were ruined.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This could have included cricket patrons, while a potential impact on reporting was the application of [[stamp duty]] to newspapers as this increased their publication costs and probably caused publishers to reduce paper size with less room for sports coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1701.html#1720 |title=From Lads to Lord's: 1720 |date=2007 |first=John |last=Leach |publisher=Stumpsite |accessdate=10 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140522/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1701.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday, 18 July 1722, London v Dartford was the subject of a letter in ''The Weekly Journal'' dated Saturday, 21 July 1722. It is believed the match took place somewhere in the [[Islington]] area, so the exact venue may have been [[White Conduit Fields]]. The match was abandoned following a dispute. The letter said: "A Match at Cricket was made between the little Parish of Dartford in Kent, and the Gentlemen known by the name of the London Club". Teams styled "London" were already in existence, as above, but this is the first actual reference to a "London Club".&lt;ref name=ACS19/&gt;&lt;ref name=DCC/&gt;&lt;ref name=IM26&gt;Maun, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dartford and London met at [[Dartford Brent]] on Thursday, 11 June 1724&lt;ref name=IM28&gt;Maun, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and, one week later, a return game was the earliest known match at [[Kennington Common]], near where [[The Oval]] is now sited. The results of both matches are unknown.&lt;ref name=ACS19/&gt;&lt;ref name=FL18C3&gt;Buckley (FL18C), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other matches in the 1720s===
On Wednesday, 6 July 1720, [[Kingston Cricket Club|Kingston]] v [[Richmond Cricket Club (18th century)|Richmond]] was played at an unknown venue and Kingston won.&lt;ref name=IM23&gt;Maun, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The secondary source is uncertain about the date due to a slight ambiguity in the primary source, a contemporary newspaper published Saturday, 16 July, which refers to "Wednesday last". The date of the match must therefore be either 6 or 13 July. The source says 5 or 12 July but this is an error as those dates were Tuesdays. Kingston and Richmond both had important teams in the first half of the 18th century.

There was a [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] v [[London Cricket Club|London]] match at [[Moulsey Hurst]] on an unknown date in 1723. The result is unknown. The source states that "XI Gentlemen of Surrey played XI of London at Moulsey Hurst during the summer". It is the earliest known mention of Moulsey Hurst as a venue for cricket.&lt;ref name=IM27&gt;Maun, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1723, the prominent [[Tory]] politician [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford]] recorded in his journal: "At Dartford upon the Heath as we came out of the town, the men of Tonbridge and the Dartford men were warmly engaged at the sport of cricket, which of all the people of England the Kentish folk are the most renowned for, and of all the Kentish men, the men of Dartford lay claim to the greatest excellence".&lt;ref name=DCC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dartfordcc.co.uk/our-history/club-history |title=Dartford Cricket Club History |publisher=Dartford Cricket Club |accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more than likely to have been Dartford Brent where this game was taking place.&lt;ref name=DCC/&gt;

On Monday, 10 August 1724, there was a match at [[Penshurst Park]] (result unknown) which featured the combined parishes of [[Penshurst, Tonbridge &amp; Wadhurst cricket team|Penshurst, Tonbridge &amp; Wadhurst]] versus Dartford. This was recorded in a diary entry by one John Dawson, who may have watched it. No details are known but Mr Dawson says it was "a great cricket match". Note that some sources have mistakenly given the venue as "Islington" but contemporary newspapers confirm that it took place at Penshurst Park.&lt;ref name=TJM18&gt;McCann, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The growth of cricket in England and overseas==
The earliest known mention of cricket being played outside England is dated Saturday, 6 May 1676. A diarist called Henry Tonge, who was part of a British mission at [[Aleppo]] in the Ottoman Empire (now in [[Syria]]), recorded that "at least forty of the English" left the city for recreational purposes and, having found a nice place to pitch a tent for dinner, they "had several pastimes and sports" including "krickett". At six they "returned home in good order".&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, cricket had been introduced to India, North America&lt;ref&gt;Simon Worrall, {{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2006/october/cricket.php |title=Cricket, Anyone? |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Magazine |date=October 2006 |accessdate=30 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] but the first definite references occur in the 18th century. In 1709, cricket was played by [[William Byrd II|William Byrd]] of Westover on his [[James River]] estates in [[Virginia]], then a British colony. This is the earliest reference to cricket being played in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;William Byrd, ''The Secret Diary of William Byrd of Westover'', Dietz Publishing, 1941, pp. 144–146.&lt;/ref&gt; There had not been any English colonisation of Australasia or southern Africa, where [[Test cricket]] is played now, by 1725.&lt;ref name=RB261/&gt; Australia and New Zealand had been partly explored by [[Abel Tasman]] in the 1640s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/pages/tasman.html |title=Abel Tasman |publisher=Project Gutenberg of Australia |accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but still had only their [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Maori people|Maori]] inhabitants respectively. The first European settlement in South Africa was founded on Tuesday, 6 April 1652 when the [[Dutch East India Company]] established [[Cape Colony]] on [[Table Bay]], near present-day [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger B. Beck, ''The History of South Africa'', Greenwood, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1721, British sailors of the [[East India Company]] were reported to be playing cricket at [[Khambhat|Cambay]], near [[Vadodara|Baroda]], and this is the earliest reference to cricket being played in the Indian sub-continent. One of the players wrote: "When my boat was lying for a fortnight in one of the channels, though the country was inhabited by the Culeys (''sic''), we every day diverted ourselves with playing Cricket and to other Exercises, which they would come and be spectators of".&lt;ref name=RG3&gt;{{cite book |last=Guha |first=Ramachandra |authorlink=Ramachandra Guha |title=A Corner of a Foreign Field – An Indian History of a British Sport |year=2001 |publisher=Picador |isbn= |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that cricket was introduced to the Americas and India before it had spread throughout the British Isles. For example, there is no record of cricket in [[Yorkshire]], home of the English game's most successful [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|club]], until 1751. The earliest mentions of cricket in Ireland, Scotland and Wales occur even later in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=RB261&gt;Bowen, pp. 261–267.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Britain's seafaring and trading concerns ensured the spread of cricket overseas, at home it relied heavily on ease of transport and communications, most of these being waterborne as long journeys tended to be undertaken using coastal or river vessels.&lt;ref name=L1706/&gt; Road transport was slowly improving and, in 1706, Parliament established the first [[turnpike trusts]] that placed a length of road under the control of trustees drawn from local landowners and traders.&lt;ref&gt;William Albert, ''The Turnpike Road System in England 1663–1840'', Cambridge University Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The turnpike trusts borrowed capital for road maintenance against the security of tolls. This arrangement became the common method of road maintenance for the next 150 years and came in time to assist the spread of cricket throughout Britain.&lt;ref name=L1706&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1701.html#1706 |title=From Lads to Lord's: 1706 |date=2007 |first=John |last=Leach |publisher=Stumpsite |accessdate=17 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140522/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1701.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of known organised matches (1611–1725)==
The table below is fully chronological. It summarises all of the 27 known organised matches from 1611 to 1725 and does not separate matches by form or status. It therefore includes examples of both "[[first-class cricket|important]]" and "minor" matches, bearing in mind that some minor matches are historically significant. Unless specified as such, "impromptu" games amongst friends, practice matches, etc. are excluded.&lt;ref name=ACS4/&gt; Although [[single wicket cricket|single wicket]] was in vogue at the time, the earliest definite record of a single wicket match is in 1726.&lt;ref name=IM33/&gt;

The earliest known [[village cricket]] match; and the earliest known organised match in [[Kent]], in England and in the world. Deduced from a 1640 court case which recorded a "cricketing" of "Weald and Upland" ''versus'' "Chalkhill" at Chevening "about thirty years since" (i.e., c.1611). As with the 1597 reference (see "Other events" below), the case concerned the land on which the game was played. The 1611 season as such was the fourteenth since the sport's earliest definite reference in 1597.

The earliest definite mention of cricket in [[Sussex]] is dated 1611 but this is believed to be the earliest known ''organised match'' in the county. Knowledge of it stems from the death thirteen days later of [[Jasper Vinall]], on whom an inquest was held. He had suffered a head injury during the game when accidentally hit by the [[cricket bat|bat]]. As Vinall came from [[West Hoathly]], it is ''assumed'' that the event was a village cricket match between the two parish teams.

| colspan="4" |
A historically significant event which is recorded by numerous sources, starting with [[G. B. Buckley]] in his FL18C. It is the world's earliest known [[first-class cricket|important cricket match]] (possibly [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]] v [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] or [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]]) and, as Buckley said, "the earliest record of an eleven a side match". Following the decision of the English government in 1695 to allow freedom of the press (i.e., they decided not to renew the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]] which had inhibited the scope of publications), it was possible for sporting events to be reported; however, it was a long time before editors gave sport any priority so coverage remained low key and infrequent for several decades. The 1697 match was reported in a periodical called the ''Foreign Post'' and described as "a great match at cricket" that was played "the middle of last week" in Sussex with "eleven of a side" and "they played for fifty guineas apiece". The stakes on offer indicate the importance of the fixture and the fact that it was eleven a side suggests that two strong and well-balanced teams were assembled. There is no scorecard and hence no statistics, so the match is outside the scope of the sport's ''statistical'' record, but it is the earliest-known example of an important match in the ''historical'' record and occurred in the 100th season since the sport's earliest definite reference in 1597.

The participants were all "gentlemen" though "others" could attend as spectators. Classification is uncertain, though it must presumably be viewed as a minor event given the limited social status of the participants, the relatively low stakes (£10 and £20 are mentioned in the newspaper report) and the ten-a-side teams. It is nevertheless the earliest known organised match in [[Surrey]]; the earliest ''definite mention'' of cricket in the county was the [[John Derrick|1597 court case in Guildford]].

The primary source gives the venue as "Maulden" which almost certainly refers to [[West Malling|Town Malling]]. The title "West of Kent" suggests a team representative of several parishes, so this is arguably the earliest known important match in Kent. There were several matches throughout the 18th century involving teams called "West Kent" and "East Kent". Chatham was a prominent centre of cricket in the 18th century.

Probably a minor local match only but it illustrates the popularity of cricket in Kent. The original source is the diary of one Thomas Minter, a [[Canterbury]] resident, who wrote: "We beat Ash Street at Crickets (''sic'')".

From this time, in the 112th season since the sport's earliest definite reference in 1597, there are references to counties in use as team names although it is generally believed that the earliest "inter-county matches" were really inter-parish matches involving two villages on either side of a county boundary.&lt;ref name=PVC1&gt;Buckley (FLPVC), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] was an important club in the first half of the 18th century and its team at this time featured [[William Bedle]]. The match is the earliest known mention of Dartford Brent as a venue.

Thomas Marchant, a farmer from [[Hurstpierpoint]] in Sussex, first mentioned cricket in his diary. He made numerous references to the game, particularly concerning his local club, until 1727. His son Will played for "our parish", as he invariably called the Hurstpierpoint team. In total, his diaries mention 21 village matches and the entries provide evidence of the widespread popularity of cricket in Sussex.

It is from the 1717 season that a continuous history of English cricket by season is possible. Records of cricket have survived from every season after 1716, although the details in most seasons through the 18th century remain sparse.

This match is the earliest known mention of White Conduit Fields as a venue. The game was abandoned on Monday, 1 September 1718, because three Rochester players "made an elopement" in an attempt to have the game declared incomplete so that they would retain their stake money. London was clearly winning at the time. The London players sued for their winnings and the game while incomplete was the subject of a noted lawsuit in which the terms of the wager were at issue. The court ordered that the match must be "played out" (see next entry).

The continuation of the September 1718 match (see above entry), which was abandoned by the Rochester players. Following a legal action in which the London players sued for their winnings, the court ordered that the match must be "played out". The exact date in July 1719 is uncertain but it was before the 4th. Rochester with four wickets standing needed 30 to win but were all out for 9. It is not certain if 30 was their overall target or if they needed thirty more in addition to runs scored in the original encounter; equally, it is not known if 9 was the innings total they achieved or if they added nine more to their "overnight" score. London's 21-run victory is the earliest known definite result of any cricket match.

Reportedly played for "a considerable sum of money". There is an insight into the priorities of early 18th century cricketers as the contemporary report concludes with: "The Kentish men won the wager" (i.e., the wager was more important than the match).

The secondary source is uncertain about the date due to a slight ambiguity in the primary source, a contemporary newspaper published Saturday, 16 July, which refers to "Wednesday last". The date of the match must therefore be either 6 or 13 July. The source says 5 or 12 July but this is an error as those dates were Tuesdays. Kingston and Richmond both had important teams in the first half of the 18th century.

Two London [[fielding (cricket)|fielders]] were seriously injured by a clash of heads when chasing the ball. Waghorn speculated that their injuries may have caused a perception that the sport is "dangerous" as the next report he could find was for a match in 1726. If there was a lapse in cricket at this time, the more likely causes would be either: (a) the [[South Sea Bubble]] which ruined many investors and so could have reduced cricket patronage; or (b), as Waghorn himself mentions, "the (news)papers were small, and space limited, the advertising and reporting (of) matches ceased".

Not a match in England, but one involving English sailors of the [[East India Company]], who played a match at [[Khambhat|Cambay]], near [[Vadodara|Baroda]]. It is the earliest known reference to cricket being played in the Indian sub-continent. One of the players wrote: "When my boat was lying for a fortnight in one of the channels, though the country was inhabited by the Culeys (''sic''), we every day diverted ourselves with playing Cricket and to other Exercises, which they would come and be spectators of".&lt;ref name=RG3/&gt;

The subject of a letter in ''The Weekly Journal'' dated 21 July 1722. It is believed the match took place somewhere in the [[Islington]] area, so the exact venue may have been [[White Conduit Fields]]. The match was abandoned following a dispute. The letter said: "A Match at Cricket was made between the little Parish of Dartford in Kent, and the Gentlemen known by the name of the London Club". Teams styled "London" were already in existence, as above, but this is the first actual reference to a "London Club".

Dartford Brent is ''assumed'' to have been the venue because of the wording used by a primary source (see below). If, however, the venue was in [[Chingford]], then this is the earliest known match in [[Essex]]. In an attempt to nullify the wagers, the Chingford team refused to play to a finish when Stead's team had the advantage. A court case followed and, as in the London v. Rochester match in 1718, it was ordered to be played out so that all wagers could be fulfilled. [[John Pratt (judge)|Lord Chief Justice Pratt]] presided over the case and he "referr'd the said Cause back to Dartford Heath (i.e., Brent), to be played on where they left off, and a Rule of Court was made accordingly".&lt;ref name=IM33&gt;Maun, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The game was completed in September 1726. The final result is not on record, and there is no confirmation that Stead's team held their advantage and won.

The subject of Gage's letter to Richmond on 16 July (see above). Richmond had challenged Gage to a match at Goodwood. However, the report in the ''Daily Journal'' newspaper on 21 July confirms Bury Hill (then called Berry Hill), near Arundel, as the venue. The match, played before "a vast Concourse of People", was hosted by [[Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk]] who gave a ball at [[Arundel Castle]] in the evening. 1725 was English cricket's 128th season since the sport's earliest definite reference in 1597.

==First mentions==
As illustrated by the table of matches above, little is known of organised cricket to 1725 because of the lack of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]] which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries.&lt;ref name="L96"/&gt; It follows that equally little is known of clubs and teams, players and locations.

The four bulleted lists below summarise the known participants to 1725 under each heading. The earliest important match that is designated inter-county was in 1709 and the [[Historic counties of England|traditional county]] soon became the key unit of organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Webber, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1725, only nine counties (plus [[London]] which has on occasion&lt;ref name="LCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1701.html#london |title=From Lads to Lord's: London Cricket Club |first=John |last=Leach |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2007 |accessdate=17 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140259/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1701.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/191/First-Class_Matches.html |title=First-class matches played by London County |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2003 |accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; been equated in status with the counties of [[Middlesex]] and [[Surrey]] for cricketing purposes) had been mentioned in surviving records in connection with cricket and the earliest mention of each is summarised below. Note that all are in the south-eastern quarter of the country. In a similar vein, although not always in association with one of the above matches, those players, venues, clubs and teams known to have been active or in use by 1725 are also listed.

===Counties===
The first definite mentions of cricket in the following [[Historic counties of England|traditional counties]] occurred between 1597 and 1724:

In 1999 the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] installed '''[[FieldTurf]]''' in [[Memorial Stadium, Lincoln|Memorial Stadium]]. In 2006, Nebraska installed new FieldTurf that alternates between two shades of green every five yards. [[Texas Tech University]] installed FieldTurf in Jones AT&amp;T Stadium.
[[University of Nevada, Reno|Nevada]] installed FieldTurf at its [[Mackay Stadium]] in [[2000 in sports|2000]]. The playing surface had been natural grass for 34&amp;nbsp;seasons.

FieldTurf was installed at [[Qwest Field]] (originally Seahawks Stadium) in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://o.seattletimes.nwsource.com/sports/seahawks/stadium/construction/turf.html Seahawks Stadium]&lt;/ref&gt; The original plans called for a natural grass field at the new stadium, but due to the favorable reactions from players while playing at Husky Stadium, the Seahawks had FieldTurf installed instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/othersports/32948_turf27.shtml Showdown looms over turf in new stadium]&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday, April 29, 2003, the Georgia World Congress Center Authority announced that it had selected FieldTurf as the new surface for the [[Georgia Dome]], replacing the [[AstroTurf]] surface in use at the Dome since its inception in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldturf.com/artificial-turf-news/P1221/gwcc-selects-fieldturf-for-georgia-dome/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726234913/http://www.fieldturf.com/artificial-turf-news/P1221/gwcc-selects-fieldturf-for-georgia-dome/ |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Washington State University]] installed FieldTurf at its [[Martin Stadium]] in [[2000 in sports|2000]]. The [[University of Oregon]] installed [[NexTurf]] in [[Autzen Stadium]] in 2001 but the surface did not perform as expected and during remodeling in [[2002 in sports|2002]] it was removed and replaced with FieldTurf. The University of Utah installed FieldTurf in 2002 and replaced it in 2009. [[Colorado State University|Colorado State]] installed FieldTurf at its [[Sonny Lubick Field at Hughes Stadium|Hughes Stadium]] in [[2006 in sports|2006]]. The playing surface had been natural grass for 38 seasons.

The [[New England Patriots]] installed FieldTurf midway into the [[2006 NFL season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation was made during a week when the team was on the road.

According to the wiki article the turf at St Louis needs to be removed each year to allow access for the floor of the facility for the conventions.  Considering the turf was laid down by Field Turf Inc at St Louis and the fact that pictures of the turf at Wisner show a Rams Logo I think this is the same turf. --&gt;

It is awarded by a panel of journalists, with the vote taking place in December. It was first awarded in 1936. It is named in honour of [[Lou Marsh]], a prominent Canadian athlete, referee, and former sports editor of the ''[[Toronto Star]]''. Marsh died in 1936 and the trophy was named in his honour. The trophy is made of black marble and stands around 75 centimetres high. The words "With Pick and Shovel" appear above the engraved names of the winners.&lt;ref name="2007Winner"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/284464|title=Sidney Crosby wins Lou Marsh award|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2007-12-11|accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voting panel consists of sports media voters from across the country&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emailreg.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?GXHC_gx_session_id_=ea55e2e3fe3ca472&amp;pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_PrintFriendly&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1165877416160|title=Turin queen reigns in 2006|author=Dave Perkins|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2006-12-12|accessdate=2007-12-12}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; including representatives from the ''Toronto Star'', ''[[The Canadian Press]]'', [[CJCL|FAN590]], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], [[Rogers Sportsnet]], [[The Sports Network|CTV/TSN]], ''[[La Presse (Canada)|La Presse]]'' and the ''[[National Post]]''.&lt;ref name="2008Winner"/&gt;

The Trophy has been awarded 77 times and won by 60 individual athletes and three pairs. [[Wayne Gretzky]] has won the trophy four times, more than any other athlete, while [[Barbara Ann Scott]] has won the trophy three times, more than any other woman. It was not awarded from 1942 to 1944 due to [[World War II]]. There were ties between different athletes in 1978 and 1983. The most recent winner is [[Joey Votto]], first baseman for the [[Cincinnati Reds]].

The '''Manila Grand Opera House''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Marangal na Bahay-Opera ng Maynila'', abbreviated '''MGOH''') was a [[theater]] and [[opera house]] located in the [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]] district of [[Manila]] on the intersection of [[Rizal Avenue]] and Doroteo Jose Street. First built in the mid-19th century as a circular wooden structure with a [[Nypa fruticans|nipa]] roof known as the H.T. Hashim’s National Cycle Track, the complex served as the center of Philippine culture and the primary theater for the viewing of plays, movies and [[zarzuela]]s in Manila prior to the construction of the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] in the 1960s.  The complex had undergone several incarnations and name changes before being demolished.  A hotel has since been constructed on the site on where the theater once stood.

==History==
[[Image:Taft Addressing First Philippine Assembly 1907.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[William Howard Taft]] addressing the audience at the [[Philippine Assembly]] in the Manila Grand Opera House.]]
The Manila Grand Opera House was built in the mid-19th century as the H.T. Hashim’s National Cycle Track, a circular wooden structure with a [[Nypa fruticans|nipa]] roof.&lt;ref name="inquirer"&gt;{{cite news|author=Santos, Tina |title=Hint of nostalgia on site of Manila Grand Opera House |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/metro/view/20080809-153675/Hint-of-nostalgia-on-site-of-Manila-Grand-Opera-House |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc. |date=2008-08-09 |accessdate=2008-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522104550/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/metro/view/20080809-153675/Hint-of-nostalgia-on-site-of-Manila-Grand-Opera-House |archivedate=2011-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the name was changed to the ''Teatro Nacional'' (National Theater), where the Russian Circus and some American theater companies performed.  The name was subsequently changed to the Manila Grand Opera House after an extensive expansion of the original theater and its conversion to an opera house in time for the visit of an Italian opera company in 1902, after the American takeover of the Philippines,&lt;ref name="inquirer" /&gt; and was used as the location of the inauguration of the members of the [[Philippine Assembly|First Philippine Assembly]] on October 16, 1907.&lt;ref name="assembly"&gt;{{cite news|author=Uckung, Peter Jaynul V. |title=Dominador Gomez rattled the first Philippine Assembly |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/oct/16/yehey/opinion/20071016opi7.html |work=[[The Manila Times]] |publisher=Manila Times Publishing Corporation |date=2007-10-16 |accessdate=2008-01-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117064416/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/oct/16/yehey/opinion/20071016opi7.html |archivedate=2008-01-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in Manila Grand Opera House where the Philippines' pioneer symphonic group, the [[Manila Symphony Orchestra|Manila Symphony Society]], performed its first concert on January 22, 1926.&lt;ref name="philippinestudies"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Carrion, Carmita | title=The Manila Symphony Society: 1926-1958 | url=http://www.philippinestudies.net/ojs/index.php/ps/article/view/3094 | work=[[Philippine Studies]] | volume=6 | issue=1 | pages=5–52 | publisher=[[Ateneo de Manila University Press]] | year=1958 | accessdate=3 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the concert was to raise funds for the building of the Philippine Constabulary Orchestra's music library.&lt;ref name="philippinestudies" /&gt;

Two important performances in Manila Grand Opera are [[Claro M. Recto]]'s award-winning dramas ''La ruta de Damasco '' and '' Solo entre las sombras '' &lt;ref name="clarorecto"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Matibag, Eugenio | title=STAGING THE NATION: CLARO M.

Another key event is the convention organized by the socialist and communist parties of the Philippines on November 7, 1938 where both parties officially merged as one, taking the name “[[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930|Communist Party of the Philippines]]”, which was later renamed Communist Party of the Philippines-1930 (PKP-1930), in order to avoid confusion with [[Communist Party of the Philippines|the splinter group of the same name]]. &lt;ref name="abadsantos"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Pedro B.

[[File:LRTstationjf9675 13.JPG|thumb|MGOH viewed from the LRT-1 station]]
The theater served as the home for theater productions, operas and zarzuelas in the Manila area until the onset of [[World War II]].  Toribio Teodoro, then referred to as the "shoe king of the Philippines", acquired the property in 1942 and used the MGOH as his residence during the Japanese occupation and the [[Second Philippine Republic]], at which his house and shoe factory were seized by Japanese forces.&lt;ref name="inquirer" /&gt;  Floods and a fire damaged the theater in 1943 and 1944, respectively, with reconstruction efforts commencing after the war.

By the 1950s, the theater, equipped with state-of-the-art equipment for both theatrical and cinematic productions, was dubbed its famous title "The Theater with a History".&lt;ref name="inquirer" /&gt;  It provided daily entertainment for Manila residents, charging 85 [[Philippine peso|centavos]] for admission to one theatrical production and one movie.  In addition to plays and movie showings, [[balagtasan]],&lt;ref name="spanish litt"&gt;{{cite journal|author=NLP |title=Literature in Spanish |url=http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:9000/rpc/cat/finders/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v4/v5.pdf |work=[[National Library of the Philippines|NLP]] |publisher=National Library of the Philippines |accessdate=2 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502215338/http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:9000/rpc/cat/finders/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v4/v5.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; operas, concerts and ''[[bodabil]]'' (vaudeville) performances were occasionally staged in the complex.&lt;ref name="inquirer" /&gt;

Ownership of the complex shifted from the heirs of Teodoro to former Philippine Ambassador to Laos [[Antonio Cabangon Chua]] in the 1960s, by which then the MGOH had become a cinema.  Part of Cabangon Chua's plan for the complex include the construction of a hotel at the complex.&lt;ref name="inquirer" /&gt;

As economic activity shifted from the Avenida area to [[Makati City]] in the 1970s, the MGOH was converted into what was then dubbed the largest [[nightclub]] in Manila: ''Chicks O'Clock'', catering to the working class near the Avenida area.&lt;ref name="cocktales"&gt;{{cite news | author=Agustin, Victor C. | title=Grand Opera returns as a de-luxe hotel | url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=business5_july14_2008 | work=[[Manila Standard Today]] | publisher=Kamahalan Publishing Corporation | date=2008-07-14 | accessdate=2008-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The continued slump in Avenida eventually forced the closure of the club and the demolition of the theater.

===Manila Grand Opera Hotel===
[[File:WTMP A-trio b6 2.JPG|thumb|Manila Grand Opera Hotel and Casino]]
Partially fulfilling Cabangon Chua's vision for the site and as a contribution to the revival of the Avenida area, the Manila Grand Opera Hotel was constructed on the site of the former MGOH.  The eight-storey hotel opened in August 2008, with its second building opening sometime in 2009.&lt;ref name="inquirer" /&gt;  It will be the only hotel with a direct connection to the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1]], connecting to [[Doroteo Jose LRT Station]], which is also rumored to be constructed on the MGOH grounds.

The '''Manitoba Sports [[Hall of Fame]] and Museum''' is a museum in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada, dedicated to the history of sport in Manitoba and honouring the best in sport. The organization began in 1980 and in 1993, a museum was opened in [[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]]. After five years, the museum moved to [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|The Bay]] store on Portage Avenue.

However, the museum has moved to the Sport Manitoba building, and had a grand opening on October 27, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.halloffame.mb.ca/news_view.php?id=528 |title=Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame Grand Opening |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibits of Manitoba's sports teams and honoured athletes are displayed in the museum.

The '''Millmoor Ground''', commonly known as '''Millmoor''', is a [[Association football|football]] stadium in [[Rotherham]], [[South Yorkshire]], England. It was the home ground of [[Rotherham County F.C.]] between 1907 and 1925 and then their successors [[Rotherham United F.C.]] until 2008. The stadium has had no professional tenant since, but has been in use again for local youth football since 2016.

==History==
The stadium was in use during the 1890s, with Rotherham Church Institute using the ground in the [[Sheffield Association League]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheffield Independent, 15 November 1897&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rotherhamunited"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themillers.co.uk//|title=Official website Rotherham United FC|date=23 March 2016|work=|accessdate=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322193609/http://www.themillers.co.uk/|archive-date=22 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presently has a capacity of around 8,300. Redevelopment work was started on the ground, with a new main stand being built in place of the previous wooden main stand which was built in the 1950s. The new stand was planned to contain corporate facilities and bring the capacity back to over 10,000. The work was scheduled to finish in 2006, but has faced a series of setbacks, one of which was [[Japanese knotweed]] being found on the site. Rotherham United have now moved to a [[New York Stadium|new community stadium]]. In May 2011 [[Rotherham R.U.F.C.|Rotherham Titans]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham|Rotherham Council]] announced a plan to allow the [[rugby union]] club to move into Millmoor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rotherhamrugby.co.uk/News.php?id=a68884279e04bcb792d3afc0de75e1bb |title=Millmoor Deal A Step Nearer! |author=Rotherham Titans |date=6 October 2011 |work= |publisher=Rotherham Titans |accessdate=22 June 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After much speculation it was announced in December 2011 that the Titans would remain at [[Clifton Lane]] for the foreseeable future due to the deal falling through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/millmoor_move_collapses_to_leave_rotherham_looking_for_new_home_1_4070438|title=Yorkshire Post Article|date=17 December 2011|work=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millmoor hosted a number of memorable Rotherham United games including a first leg of the inaugural Football League Cup final against Aston Villa in 1961, which Rotherham won 2–0.

On 22 September 2007, for Rotherham United's game against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], it was a special day to celebrate 100 years at Millmoor. The game ended 1&amp;ndash;1, with [[Peter Holmes (footballer)|Peter Holmes]] scoring for the Millers. There were special articles in the matchday programme and a commemorative cover. There were balloons all around Millmoor, with the Millers' badge, and the words '100 Years at Millmoor'. Fans were urged to wear retro Rotherham United shirts in order to be entered into a raffle. Many fans were seen with new scarves with Rotherham United F.C. on one side and 1907-2007 on the other side.

In May 2008, Rotherham United were forced to leave Millmoor after talks with Ken Booth, owner of Millmoor, broke down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/end_of_an_era_millmoor_farewell_for_rotherham_1_2502707|title=End of an era: Millmoor farewell for Rotherham|work=[[Yorkshire Post]]|date=30 May 2008|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team played in the [[Don Valley Stadium]] in [[Sheffield]] until 2012, when the club moved into a [[New York Stadium|new community stadium]] in Rotherham. Millmoor is currently used by Westfield United of The Bud Evans BD U18 Division 5

==Structure and facilities==
=== Tivoli End ===

The Tivoli was a favourite amongst the fans. The stand holds up to 2,700. It was a former terrace but was later seated during the club's time in the [[Football League Championship]].

===Railway End===
[[File:The Visitor's End at Millmoor, Rotherham - geograph.org.uk - 1229503.jpg|thumb|Away terrace in 1976]]
The Railway End is the away fans section where over 2,000 fans can be accommodated. This end is covered and all seated. An unusual feature is that away fans can only access this end by going down Millmoor Lane, which is a narrow alleyway. The acoustics on the railway end are said to be some of the best and fans can generate a lot of noise. If needed, away fans can be given additional seats in a section of the Millmoor Lane stand.

The railway referred to in the stand's name is the now closed line to the former [[Rotherham Westgate railway station]].

===Main stand===
[[File:Stand under construction - geograph.org.uk - 336903.jpg|thumb|Stand under construction in 2005]]
Redevelopment work was started on this stand, however that work has now ceased and in November 2007 the club confirmed that it had no intentions to complete this stand or modernise any part of the stadium due to the difficulty in reaching a deal to purchase the land surrounding Millmoor from the previous chairman. This dispute later led to Rotherham United moving away from the stadium.&lt;ref name="verganeglorie"/&gt; The stand remains partly finished.

===Millmoor Lane End===
Opposite to the Main Stand is the Millmoor Lane side of the ground. It is split up into three sections:
*Tivoli end/Uncovered end - before the ground was all-seated in conformity with the rules of the [[Football League Championship]], the corner of the ground underneath the floodlights was a continuation of the terraces of the Tivoli End. When the section was all seated, the Tivoli End was split up into two parts for safety reasons: the part of the stand segregated from the Tivoli Stand is now simply called "The Uncovered End" due to the fact there is no roof over the heads of the home supporters housed there.
*Millmoor Lane - in the middle of the Millmoor Lane side is the Millmoor Lane, which is a small stand for home supporters.

[[Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom|Greyhound racing]] took place at Millmoor Stadium from 11 May 1931 until 29 July 1933. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the [[National Greyhound Racing Club]]) and was known as a flapping track which was the nickname given to independent tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =422|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NBT Bank Stadium''' is a publicly owned, 11,071-seat, [[minor league baseball]] [[stadium]] in [[Syracuse, New York]]. It is the home stadium for the [[Syracuse Mets]] [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] baseball team of the [[International League]]. The stadium, owned and at times operated by [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]], opened on April 10, 1997, replacing the aging [[MacArthur Stadium]] which had served as home to Syracuse's professional baseball teams since 1934 and which was demolished in 1997.

==Mets baseball==
{{Main article|Syracuse Mets}}

The stadium is home to the Syracuse Mets, the Triple-A affiliate of the [[New York Mets]]. The field's outfield dimensions are {{convert|330|ft|m}} to left field, {{convert|400|ft|m}} to center field, and {{convert|330|ft|m}} to right field.
The stadium has an official [[seating capacity]] of 11,071 people.&lt;ref name="parks"/&gt;  In addition to regular seating, the stadium also offers luxury suites and a banquet room.  The luxury suites are available in three different sized configurations and all include indoor and outdoor seating options as well as optional stadium-provided catering.&lt;ref name="luxury"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tickets - Luxury Suites|url=http://www.milb.com/tickets/page.jsp?ymd=20060210&amp;content_id=41245&amp;vkey=tickets_t552&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t552|publisher=[[Syracuse Chiefs]]|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stadium's banquet room is named after former baseball player [[Hank Sauer]] who was with the then Syracuse Chiefs in the 1940s prior to going on to excel in the Major Leagues into the late 1950s and eventually have his number retired by the team.  The room is near the right field foul pole and is available to rent year-round.&lt;ref name="sauer"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tickets - Hank Sauer Room|url=http://www.milb.com/tickets/page.jsp?ymd=20060210&amp;content_id=41247&amp;vkey=tickets_t552&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t552|publisher=[[Syracuse Chiefs]]|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seating is broken down into the following: 280 in the 20 luxury suites, 3,000 in the 300 (upper) level, and 7,791 in the lower level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skychiefs.com/SkyChiefs/ticketinfo.html |title=Ticket Information - Syracuse SkyChiefs - AAA Baseball |website=SkyChiefs.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990209082216/http://skychiefs.com/SkyChiefs/ticketinfo.html |archive-date=February 9, 1999 |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=Only one of the numbers is given, and it's in a different context.|date=August 2018}}

From its opening through the 2007 season, the stadium's playing surface was [[AstroTurf]], mainly due to the team's then-affiliation with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] who used the artificial surface in their ballpark.  However, after the 2007 season, the Astro Turf was removed and replaced with natural grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Put the Rug to the Curb and Get Growing|first=Bud|last=Poliquin|url=http://www.syracuse.com/poststandard/stories/index.ssf?/base/sports-0/1182675787223220.xml&amp;coll=1|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=June 24, 2007|accessdate=June 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A record for baseball attendance was set May 7, 2010, when 14,098 people came to the park for [[Stephen Strasburg]]'s Triple-A debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Syracuse 7 Gwinnett 0|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?sid=t552&amp;t=g_box&amp;gid=2010_05_07_gwiaaa_syraaa_1|publisher=[[Syracuse Chiefs]]|date=May 7, 2010|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2012, the Syracuse Chiefs announced a new videoboard would be installed by the time the Chiefs took on the Durham Bulls on May 7, 2012. The screen measures 30' X 55' (LED High Definition display), making it one of the largest video boards in the minor leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Syracuse Chiefs to Update Stadium With New Daktronics Video Display|url=http://syracuse.chiefs.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120320&amp;content_id=27439624&amp;vkey=pr_t552&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t552|publisher=[[Syracuse Chiefs]]|date=March 20, 2012|accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium's PA system also was upgraded.

==Other uses==

===Soccer===
The former [[soccer]] club [[Syracuse Salty Dogs]] of the [[United Soccer Leagues]]' [[USL First Division|A-League]] also called the stadium home for two seasons. Though they were very popular with fans and had very high attendance, their relationships with the Chiefs and Onondaga County were not positive and the team ceased operations after their second season.

===Concerts===
In 2009, the stadium played host to the first two national concerts held at the stadium since 2000 when [[The Allman Brothers Band]] played there.&lt;ref name="listenUp1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Online Ticket Request Period for Dave Matthews Band's August 4 Show at Syracuse's Alliance Bank Stadium Starts Today|first=Mark|last=Bialczak|url=http://blog.syracuse.com/listenup/2009/02/online_ticket_request_for_dave.html#more|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=February 19, 2009|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19, 2009, the stadium hosted 7,124 fans who came to see [[Bob Dylan]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[John Mellencamp]] perform.&lt;ref name="fansApprove"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fans Approve of Alliance Bank Stadium as Concert Venue|first=Nina|last=Wegner|url=http://www.syracuse.com/entertainment/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-2/1248080133222280.xml&amp;coll=1|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=July 20, 2009|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="listenUp2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dylan Clearly Shows that He's a Man of Words at Alliance Bank Stadium in Syracuse|first=Mark|last=Bialczak|url=http://blog.syracuse.com/listenup/2009/07/dylan_clearly_shows_that_hes_a.html|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=July 19, 2009|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks after the Bob Dylan concert, on August 4, [[Dave Matthews Band]] was scheduled to perform at the stadium.&lt;ref name="Axe"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dave Matthews Band to Play Alliance Bank Stadium|first=Brent|last=Axe|url=http://www.syracuse.com/axeman/index.ssf/2009/02/dave_matthews_at_alliance_bank.html|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=February 19, 2009|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stadium management said they used lessons learned during the smaller-scale Dylan show to make the much larger-scale Dave Matthews Band show as smooth as possible.&lt;ref name="fansApprove"/&gt;  The show drew over 18,000 fans and was considered a great success, possibly paving the way for more concerts at the stadium in the years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thousands Flock to Syracuse's Alliance Bank Stadium to See Dave Matthews Band|first=Nina|last=Wegner|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2009/08/thousands_flock_to_syracuses_a.html|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=August 5, 2009|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hockey===
Following the success of the 2008 and 2009 [[NHL Winter Classic]] outdoor hockey games, [[Syracuse Crunch]] owner Howard Dolgan started expressing his interest in holding a similar event in Syracuse.  Alliance Bank stadium was the logical location to hold such an event since it is the only outdoor professional sports venue in the area.  The Crunch estimated the cost of such an event to be between $850,000 and $1.05 million.&lt;ref name="axeHockey"&gt;{{cite news |title=When You Hate Being Right|first=Brent|last=Axe|url=http://www.syracuse.com/axeman/index.ssf/2009/05/when_you_hate_being_right.html|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=May 29, 2009|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That being the case, Dolgan decided to ask the [[Onondaga County]] legislature for some financial help in putting on the event.  Dolgan argued that since the event was expected to bring many out of town hockey fans to Syracuse, the county could use $350,000 of money set aside "specifically to promote tourism and to attract out-of-town dollars to Syracuse".&lt;ref name="axeHockey2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Howard Dolgan On the "Idiots"|first=Brent|last=Axe|url=http://www.syracuse.com/axeman/index.ssf/2009/06/howard_dolgon_on_the_idiots.html|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=June 2, 2009|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The money in that fund is collected as a tax on hotel rooms in the county and could be replenished by the people coming in from out-of-town for the hockey game.  However, the legislature voted 16-2 to not provide the $350,000 in funding and instead approved a total $75,000 in funding.  Prior to the legislature's vote, Dolgan stated publicly that without the $350,000, the game would not go on.&lt;ref name="axeHockey2"/&gt;  After the vote, Dolgan immediately turned the money down, stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;We're not doing an outdoor game. I'll tell ya, besides disappointing the fans and, of course, our organization, I can tell you about 10–12 prominent companies in Syracuse who are not going to be happy because the idiots who voted the way they did. And I don't mind saying that word. What are they going to do? Get mad at me and vote against something else I want to do?&lt;ref name="axeHockey2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eventually, the game was held at the New York State Fairgrounds on Saturday, February 20, 2010, as the "[[Mirabito Outdoor Classic]]".

===Scranton/Wilkes-Barre===
During the [[2009 IL Season|2009 International League Season]], the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders]] (then known as the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees) were forced to postpone 11 games due to drainage problems at their home park, [[PNC Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baseball Officials Inspect PNC Field|first=Jon|last=Meyer|url=http://www.wnep.com/wnep-lacka-baseball-officials-inspect-pnc-field,0,748907.story|work=[[WNEP-TV|WNEP]]|date=July 7, 2009|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yankees vs. Mets to Play Each Other at Syracuse's Alliance Bank Stadium|first=Mike|last=Waters|url=http://blog.syracuse.com/chiefs/2009/07/yankees_vs_mets_to_play_each_o.html|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=July 8, 2009|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an effort to allow groundskeepers ample time to repair the field, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre decided to relocate four of their home games.  Two of these games, both against the [[Buffalo Bisons]], were moved to Syracuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Home stand moved to Lehigh and Syracuse|url=http://community.thetimes-tribune.com/blogs/yankees/archive/2009/07/08/home-stand-moved-to-lehigh-and-syracuse.aspx|newspaper=[[The Times-Tribune (Scranton)]]|date=July 8, 2009|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==

===Construction===
Construction on the stadium was completed in 1997, at a total cost of approximately $28 million.&lt;ref name=moriarty1&gt;{{cite news |title=Onondaga County Might Sell Alliance Bank Stadium to Syracuse Chiefs|first=Rick|last=Moriarty|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/onondaga_county_might_sell_all.html|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=January 19, 2012|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing===
According to ''[[The Post-Standard]]'' newspaper, financing for stadium construction included:

* $16 million from New York state taxpayers
* $6.6 million from Onondaga County taxpayers
* $4 million from the Syracuse Chiefs/ Community Baseball Club of Central New York, Inc.
* $1 million from the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] (which was then the Chiefs' affiliated team) &lt;ref name=moriarty1/&gt;

=== Lease ===
In 2012, the Community Baseball Club of Central New York (Syracuse Chiefs) signed an 11-year lease of the stadium with [[Onondaga County]], starting at $126,000 per year, and increasing two percent per year through 2022, when it would pay $153,576. The Chiefs and County share maintenance, utility and other costs, with the former contributing about $500,000 per year to stadium upkeep.&lt;ref name=moriarty1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rent /&gt;

In its prior, 15-year lease, the Baseball Club paid no rent, but its $4 million contribution to the construction of the stadium was amortized over the term of the lease, in lieu of rent, amounting to about $22,222 per month ($266,664 per year).&lt;ref name=moriarty1 /&gt;

The Community Baseball Club had an "option to buy" the stadium from Onondaga County "by the end of 2013", at a price of $3.05 million.&lt;ref name="rent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moriarty|first1=Rick|title=Chiefs ask county to cut stadium rent|publisher=The Post-Standard|date=20 March 2016|page=C-4|URL=http://www.syracuse.com/business-news/index.ssf/2016/03/still_losing_money_syracuse_chiefs_want_cut_in_rent_at_county-owned_stadium.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moriarty3&gt;{{cite news |title=Syracuse Chiefs Get More Time to Purchase Alliance Bank Stadium|first=Rick|last=Moriarty|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/12/syracuse_chiefs_get_more_time.html|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=December 18, 2012|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming rights===
[[NBT Bank]] pays Onondaga County $140,000 per year for stadium [[naming rights]]. The 20-year agreement continues through 2025.&lt;ref name="2012naming"&gt;{{cite news |title=Alliance Bank Stadium Name Changing to NBT Bank Stadium|first=Rick|last=Moriarty|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/03/alliance_bank_stadium_name_cha.html|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=March 13, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Webb, executive vice president of NBT Bank and former president of Alliance Bank, serves on the board of directors of the Community Baseball Club of Central New York, Inc., owners of the Syracuse Chiefs and current operator of NBT Bank Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=To Escape Fiscal Crisis, Syracuse Chiefs' Board Considers Offers: One for $500,000, Another for $1 Million|first=John|last=O'Brien|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/syracuse_chiefs_board_considering_two_investment_proposals.html|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=September 30, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the stadium was known as ''P&amp;C Stadium'', derived from P&amp;C Foods, the regional brand of supermarkets run by then Syracuse-based [[Penn Traffic]] Corporation (1997–2005); and ''Alliance Bank Stadium'' (2005–2013). In 2013, Alliance Bank merged with NBT Bank, which agreed to carry on the naming rights agreement.&lt;ref name="2012naming"/&gt;

===Video screen===
The stadium's high-definition digital video screen, installed in 2012, was purchased by the Chiefs with a bank loan of $950,000, with Community Baseball Club investments as collateral; and with a County contribution of $200,000. The loan was due January 31, 2014.&lt;ref name=moriarty1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syracuse Chiefs Call for Help, But Is It Too Late|first=David M.|last=Rubin|url=http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2013/04/david_rubin_syracuse_chiefs_ca.html|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=April 10, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=March 2016}}

===Renovation===
In August 2018 the New York Mets and Onondaga County discussed a renovation which could reduce seating capacity by a third while adding a greater array of amenities, with an eye toward extending the team's commitment to NBT Bank Stadium beyond the 2025 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Spedden |first1=Zach |title=NBT Bank Stadium Renovation Being Explored |url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/08/20/nbt-bank-stadium-renovation-being-explored/ |accessdate=August 20, 2018 |work=Ballpark Digest |publisher=August Publications |date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knauss |first1=Tim |title=To keep Mets in CNY, Onondaga County seeks $25 million-plus stadium renovation |url=https://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2018/08/to_keep_mets_in_syracuse_county_eyes_major_makeover_for_nbt_bank_stadium.html |accessdate=August 20, 2018 |work=[[The Post-Standard]] |date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, some local officials raised the possibility of constructing a new downtown ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Spedden |first1=Zach |title=New Downtown Syracuse Ballpark Debated |url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/08/31/new-downtown-syracuse-ballpark-debated/ |accessdate=August 31, 2018 |work=Ballpark Digest |publisher=August Publications |date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knauss |first1=Tim |title=25 years later, debate resumes: Should CNY build a downtown baseball stadium? |url=https://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2018/08/should_syracuse_consider_building_a_new_downtown_baseball_park_again.html |accessdate=August 31, 2018 |work=The Post-Standard |date=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Stadium''' of [[Thailand]] ({{lang-th|สนามกีฬาแห่งชาติ or กรีฑาสถานแห่งชาติ}}) is a [[sports complex]] located in [[Pathum Wan District]], [[Bangkok]]. Founded in 1937 with the construction of '''Supachalasai Stadium''' ({{lang|th|สนามศุภชลาศัย}}; {{RTGS|Supphachalasai}}), its main venue, the complex has since expanded and now consists of multiple stadia and sporting facilities.

==History==
[[File:Bangkok National Stadium IMG 7300.jpg|thumb|left|In front of National Stadium]]
It is used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches. It served as the main stadium for the [[1966 Asian Games|1966]], [[1970 Asian Games|1970]], and [[1978 Asian Games]]. It was also used for the [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]], but only for one game (Oman v Iraq in Group A). The stadium is easy for spectators to get to as it is served by the [[BTS Skytrain]] which stops at the '[[National Stadium BTS station]]' right next to the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fourfourtwo.com/th/features/aacchehluueaekhkhwaamthrngccham-80-pii-suphchlaasay-kabnaakhtchuengairkhamtb&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is a single tier construction which is uncovered on three sides. A plain but effective roof covers the main-stand side. Although there is a running track, the tribunes are immediately adjacent to it so spectators are not as far from the action as they are at the newer [[Rajamangala Stadium]]. Spectator comfort was increased in 2007 with the addition of red bench seats to the previously bare concrete steps on the three open sides.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smmsport.com/m/article.php?a=9149&lt;/ref&gt;

Thai league clubs often play at the Suphachalasai in Asian competitions as their own stadiums do not meet [[Asian Football Confederation]] criteria. However, it is now rarely used by the national team who usually play at the [[Rajamangala National Stadium]]. Other stadiums in Bangkok include the [[Thai Army Sports Stadium]], the [[Thai-Japanese Stadium]] and [[Chulalongkorn University Stadium]].

*Entertainer [[Michael Jackson]] performed 2 concerts there during his ''[[Dangerous World Tour]]'' on 24 and 27 August 1993 in front of 140,000 in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dangerous Tour]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Coord|13|44|44|N|100|31|32|E|type:landmark_region:TH|display=title}}

==Stadium Facility==

===Suphachalasai Stadium===
Suphachalasai Stadium is the majority part of the National Stadium. It is the [[multi-purpose stadium]] with [[track and field]] for athletic purposes, as well as a partial roof on one of its side. With its capacity of 19,793, the stadium is being used to hold important matches such as the [[Thai FA Cup]] and [[Thai League Cup]].

===Thephasadin Stadium===
[[Thephasadin Stadium]] was constructed in 1965 for the use in [[1966 Asian Games]] as the Hockey venue, hence its original name, Hockey Field. It was renamed in 1983 in memorial of [[Chaophraya Thammasakmontri|Sanan Thephasadin na Ayutthaya]], considered the Father of Thai Football. With its capacity of 6,378 seats, it was retired from being the hockey stadium.

===Jindarat Stadium===
Jindarat Stadium, constructed after the [[Pacific War]], was formerly used as the outdoor stadium for medium-level sporting events and practicing purposes. It was originally named ''Ton Pho Stadium'', but was renamed in 1983 in memorial of Jindarat (Jamlong Sawat-chuto), former director of the Office of Sports and Recreation Development.

===Wisutamol Pool===
Wisutamol Pool was constructed in 1961 under the term of director Kong Wisutamol. It was the [[Olympic-size swimming pool]] with two sides of stands, used for the competition and general practices.

'''Newcastle International Sports Centre''' ([[Naming rights|sponsor name]]: '''McDonald Jones Stadium'''), is a multi-purpose sports [[stadium]] located in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Australia]]. The ground is home to the [[Newcastle Knights]] ([[National Rugby League]]) and [[Newcastle Jets FC]] ([[A-League]]). It is owned by the New South Wales government and administered by the Hunter Region Sporting Venues Authority. Due to past sponsorship deals, the ground has been previously known as '''Marathon Stadium''', '''EnergyAustralia Stadium''', '''Ausgrid Stadium''' and '''Hunter Stadium'''. Newcastle International Sports Centre is also known as '''Newcastle Stadium''' when in use during [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] competitions due to conflicting sponsorship reasons.

== History ==
Work began on the stadium on 1 December 1967, and was officially opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 10 April 1970. It was originally known as the ''International Sports Centre'', and is still part of the ISC complex to this day. The playing surface back then was originally oval shaped to allow both codes of rugby, soccer and cricket to be able to make use of it.

The Knights secured a lease on the stadium in 1986, and converted it from an oval to a rectangle layout. During the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour]], the [[Newcastle Knights]], in their first season, hosted a match at the ground. On that occasion the Lions, captained by [[Ellery Hanley]], defeated the Knights 28–12.

In  1992, local tyre outlet Marathon Tyres became the naming rights sponsor for the stadium, and it was renamed ''Marathon Stadium''. That year the Knights played [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] for a second time as part of the Lions [[1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia|Tour of Australasia]]. The Ellery Hanley captained Lions took the Knights apart winning 22–0. Later in the [[1992 NSWRL season]], the Knights qualified for their first ever Finals series.

Towards the end of 2001, energy supplier [[EnergyAustralia]] took over naming rights, and thus the stadium became ''EnergyAustralia Stadium''. In February 2011 it was announced that the stadium would be renamed to "Ausgrid Stadium" after EnergyAustralia was renamed "Ausgrid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/energyaustralia-stadium-to-change-name/2079909.aspx|title=EnergyAustralia stadium to change name|first=Neil|last=Goffet|newspaper=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|date=18 February 2011|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before redevelopment, the stadium had a capacity of 28,000, including 5,000 in the main grandstand. The ground attendance record for a sporting event is 32,642, which was set when the Knights took on the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] in July 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/arl-1995/round-17/newcastle-vs-manly-warringah/summary.html|title=ARL 1995 - Round 17 - Rugby League Project|first=Shawn Dollin and Andrew|last=Ferguson|date=|website=www.rugbyleagueproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a lack of incidents, police subsequently asked for the allowed capacity to be lowered for reasons of safety.

Following the retirement of former Knights captain [[Andrew Johns]], the new eastern grandstand was renamed ''The [[Andrew Johns]] Stand'' in honour of Johns in front of a packed crowd before the Knights vs [[Brisbane Broncos]] NRL match on Sunday 22 April 2007.

The name (Newcastle International Sports Centre) is used primarily by those who wish to mention stadiums by original names, such as non-commercial organisations like the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], and those with other corporate interests such as [[FIFA]] or the [[Asian Football Confederation]].

In October 2016, McDonald Jones Homes, a local Newcastle company, was named as the new naming rights sponsor of the stadium. This new deal left behind a 5 year gap between naming rights sponsors at the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/4210905/mcdonald-jones-cements-stadium-deal/|title=McDonald Jones Homes is the new naming rights sponsor of Hunter Stadium|first=Penelope|last=Green|newspaper=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Redevelopments ===

==== 2003–05 ====
The stadium underwent redevelopment during the years 2003–05, funded mostly by local and state government grants.

Factors that brought on the redevelopment included:
* non-compliance of [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) stadium criteria, especially the dressing rooms;
* failure to attract major sporting events to the area, specifically the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]];
* inadequate and ageing spectator and corporate facilities;
* covered [[seating capacity]] well below best practice and NRL standards;
* minimal areas within the grandstand to increase members' patronage both during a sporting event and on non-match-days;
* poor facilities for media officials;
* unsatisfactory temporary spectator facilities to the north and south of the western stand;
* the perceived need for the incumbent [[Government of New South Wales|State]] [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor]] government to contribute to the [[Public works|public infrastructure]] in a [[Hunter Region|region]] of [[safe seat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The first stage of the redevelopment was completed in early 2004. This consisted of;
* The construction of the lower level of the Eastern Stand (brought into operation for the 2004 NRL season and Anzac Test between Australia and New Zealand). This level holds 7,700 people.
* The relocation of corporate boxes and seating to the North and South stands.

The second stage of construction began in 2004 and was completed in 2005. This consisted of:
* The construction of the Eastern Stand's second level of seating and corporate boxes;
* a new video screen; and
* remedial work for the Western Grandstand, including updating the media facilities.

==== 2008–11 ====
During the [[New South Wales state election, 2007|2007 NSW Election]] campaign, the [[Premiers of New South Wales|Premier]] [[Morris Iemma]] promised [[Australian dollar|$]]30 million towards an upgrade of the stadium, conditional on the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Government]] matching the funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Protesters-climb-on-top-of-Iemmas-car/2007/03/20/1174153021988.html | title=Protester crash-tackled by Iemma minder | date=20 March 2007 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2008 the federal government confirmed $10m towards the development of the Western Grandstand. This is in addition to the $30m commitment from the state government. This is a critical step for the stadium's development for the upgrade to be in by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/mr-yr08-ke-ke006.htm?OpenDocument&amp;yr=2008&amp;mth=4  'Funding powers development of stadium' – Department of Health and Ageing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825150551/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/mr-yr08-ke-ke006.htm?OpenDocument&amp;yr=2008&amp;mth=4 |date=25 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Australian dollar|A$]]40 million will contribute to an expansion of the stadium's capacity to eventually hold over 40,000 as well as general improvements in the stadiums facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theherald.yourguide.com.au/news/local/general/groups-goal-for-growing-stadium/1179693.html|title=Group's goal for growing stadium – Local News – News – General – The Herald&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=yourguide.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23486060-5006068,00.html | title=Sydney fights Melbourne for the right to host World Cup | first=David | last=Davutovic | date=5 April 2008 | work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008–10 the stadium is being upgraded again&lt;ref name="theherald.yourguide.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/states-20m-grand-stand/777208.aspx|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120718073037/http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/states-20m-grand-stand/777208.aspx|deadurl=yes|title=State's $20m grand stand - Local News - News - General - Newcastle He…|author=|date=18 July 2012|archivedate=18 July 2012|website=theherald.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; to around 33 000 seats, with a hope for the stadium to be involved in the [[AFC Asian Cup|2015 Asian Cup]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup bids|2018 World Cup]] should Australia be the host of those tournaments. As part of the announcement, Morris Iemma stated that the capacity of 33,000 can be increased to the 40,000 necessary for World Cup Hosting, through temporary seating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theherald.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/20m-to-create-a-field-of-dreams/778026.aspx|title=$20m to create a field of dreams – Local News – News – General – The Herald&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=yourguide.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost of the upgrade is $60 million, with $50 million from the state government and $10 million from the Federal Government.
Although construction will take place during both the [[Newcastle Knights]] and [[Newcastle Jets]] seasons, developers have stated that there will be minimal effect on attendances due to the staged approach.&lt;ref name="theherald.yourguide.com.au"/&gt;

The stadium development is being carried out over four stages.

*Stage 1 (now completed) included dressing, warm up and medical rooms, with showers, toilets, ice baths and 855-seats of the spectator concourse in the stadium's south-west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syi.net.au/_oldgalleries/eas/index.html|title=Images of Stage 1 of 2008 Energy Australia Stadium redevelopment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stage 2 (now completed) replicates Stage 1 on the northern side of the Western Grandstand and also included the main western stand's lower concourse.
*Stage 3 (now completed) demolished the old western Grandstand and is replacing it with one similar to the eastern stand.
*Stage 4 (undertaking preparation) will involve building the northern and southern ends of the ground, replacing the grass hills with seated areas.

=== Rugby league ===
The [[Newcastle Knights]] of the [[National Rugby League]] team have been tenants of the ground since their formation in 1988.

In October 2011 the ground hosted a [[rugby league]] one-off test match between Australia and New Zealand. This event set a new ground attendance record for a sporting event of 32,890.

=== Soccer ===
&lt;!-- Do not change "soccer" to "football". Soccer is used to differentiate between rugby league, rugby union, soccer and other football codes per consensus reached at [[Talk:Australia/Archive 16#"Association football (soccer)" rather than just "soccer"|Talk:Australia]]. See also [[Talk:Soccer in Australia#Requested move]], [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2011 July 9#Category:Women's association football in Australia]] and [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2011 June 28#Category:Australian football (soccer) players]] for more examples and information. --&gt;
During the [[National Soccer League]] competition, three clubs have played their home ground games at this stadium. They are [[Newcastle KB United]] (1978–84); [[Adamstown Rosebud FC|Newcastle Rosebud United]] (1984–86) and [[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle United]] (2000–04). The NSL competition folded in 2004.

In 2005, the newly formed national competition ([[A-League]]) began to operate. [[Newcastle United Jets]] was part of the newly formed competition, and have played at this ground ever since.

The stadium also hosted two [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]] group stage matches, and also a semi final between [[Australia national football team|Australia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]] and a third place playoff between United Arab Emirates and [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]].

In February 2017 it was announced that the [[National Premier Leagues Northern NSW]] Grand Final would be taking place at the ground in September that year. In the Grand Final between the [[Edgeworth Eagles]] and [[Lambton Jaffas]] a crowd of 4174 was on hand to see the Jaffas clinch the title beating the Eagles 2-0 deep into Extra Time.

The [[2018 A-League Grand Final]] was held at the venue, contested by the Newcastle Jets and Melbourne Victory, on 5 May 2018.

=== Baseball ===
The [[Hunter Eagles]] were formed for the [[1994–95 Australian Baseball League season]] after purchasing the [[Sydney Wave]]'s licence.

[[Image:ShuttlecockPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Plastic shuttlecock]]
[[Image:Shuttlecocks Yonex Aerosensa 20.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Feather shuttlecock]]

A '''shuttlecock'''  (also called a '''bird''' or '''birdie''') is a high-drag projectile used in the sport of [[badminton]]. It has an open conical shape formed by feathers (or a synthetic alternative) embedded into a rounded cork (or rubber) base. The shuttlecock's shape makes it extremely [[aerodynamic]]ally stable. Regardless of initial orientation, it will turn to fly cork first, and remain in the cork-first orientation.

==Name==
The name 'shuttlecock' originates in Victorian times, when badminton first became popular. It is frequently shortened to '''shuttle'''. The "shuttle" part of the name was probably derived from its back-and-forth motion during the game, resembling the [[shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]] of a [[loom]], while the "cock" part of the name was probably derived from the resemblance of the feathers to those on a [[rooster]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Specifications==
A shuttlecock weighs around {{convert|4.75|to|5.50|g|lk=on|abbr=on}}. It has 16 feathers with each feather {{convert|70|mm|lk=on|abbr=on}} in length. The diameter of the cork is {{convert|25|to|28|mm|abbr=on}} and the diameter of the circle that the feathers make is around {{convert|58|to|68|mm|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Construction and materials==
A shuttlecock is formed from 16 or so overlapping feathers, usually goose or duck, embedded into a rounded cork base. The cork is covered with thin leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Birdies: How Shuttlecocks Are Made|url=http://www.officialbadminton.com/making_birdies.php|website=Official Badminton|publisher=Official Badminton|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure satisfactory flight properties, it is considered preferable to use feathers from right or left wings only in each shuttlecock, and not mix feathers from different wings, as the feathers from different wings are shaped differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yonex.ch/fileadmin/files/images/badminton_produkte/ShuttleNews_WebVersion_separation_2012.pdf |title=Yonex Shuttle News |website=http://www.yonex.ch/ |publisher=Yonex |access-date=July 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kiley |first1=Brendan |title=The Rise of the Shuttlecock |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/the-rise-of-the-shuttlecock/Content?oid=17330068 |publisher=The Stranger |date=July 24, 2013 |accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Feather or Synthetic Shuttlecocks===
The feathers are brittle; shuttlecocks break easily and often need to be replaced several times during a game. For this reason, synthetic shuttlecocks have been developed that replace the feathers with a plastic skirt. Players often refer to synthetic shuttlecocks as ''plastics'' and feathered shuttlecocks as ''feathers''.

Feather shuttles need to be properly humidified for at least 4 hours prior to play in order to fly the correct distance at the proper speed and to last longer.  Properly humidified feathers flex during play, enhancing the shuttle's speed change and durability.  Dry feathers are brittle and break easily, causing the shuttle to wobble. Saturated feathers are 'mushy', making the feather cone narrow too much when strongly hit, which causes the shuttle to fly overly far and fast.  Humidification boxes are often used, but a simple moist sponge inserted in the feather end of the closed shuttle tube will work nicely.  Water should never touch the cork of the shuttle. Shuttles are tested prior to play to make sure they fly true and at the proper speed, and cover the proper distance.  Different weights of shuttles are used to compensate for local atmospheric conditions.  Both humidity and height above sea level affect shuttle flight.  World Badminton Federation Rules say the shuttle should reach the far doubles service line plus or minus half the width of the tram. According to manufacturers (!) proper shuttle will generally travel from the back line of the court to just short of the long doubles service line on the opposite side of the net, with a full underhand hit from an average player.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from various Shuttlecock Manufacturer's recommendations - RSL, Yonex, Carleton, among others by J. Wigglesworth. May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of good quality feathers is similar to that of good quality plastics, but plastics are far more durable, typically lasting many matches without any impairment to their flight. Shuttles are easily damaged and should be replaced every three or four games, and sooner if they are damaged and do not fly straight. This interferes with the game, as the impairment on the flight of the shuttle may misdirect the direction of the shuttlecock.

Most experienced and skillful players greatly prefer feathers, and serious tournaments or leagues are always played using feather shuttlecocks of the highest quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=14913 |title=BWF's tournament sanctioned shuttlecocks |publisher=Badminton World Federation site |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experienced players generally prefer the "feel" of feathered shuttlecocks{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and assert that they are able to control the flight of feathers better than that of plastics. In Asia, where feather shuttlecocks are more affordable than in Europe and North America, plastic shuttlecocks are hardly used at all.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The playing characteristics of plastics and feathers are substantially different. Plastics fly more slowly on initial impact, but slow down less towards the end of their flight. While feathers tend to drop straight down on a clear shot, plastics never quite return to a straight drop, falling more on a diagonal. Feather shuttles may come off the strings at speeds in excess of 320&amp;nbsp;km/h (200&amp;nbsp;mph) but slow down faster as they drop. For this reason, the feather shuttle makes the game seem faster,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} but also allows more time to play strokes. Because feather shuttles fly more quickly off the racquet face they also tend to cause less shoulder impact and injury. Shuttle game is a physically rigorous game needing to run, bend quickly and played indoor as either a singles or as doubles game.

'''''The Hunger Games''''' is a 2008 [[dystopian]] novel by the American writer [[Suzanne Collins]]. It is written [[First-person narrative|in the voice of]] 16-year-old [[Katniss Everdeen]], who lives in the future, [[post-apocalyptic]] nation of [[Panem]] in North America. [[The Capitol (Hunger Games)|The Capitol]], a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation. The Hunger Games is an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged&amp;nbsp;12–18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death.

The book received critical acclaim from major reviewers and authors. It was praised for its plot and character development. In writing ''The Hunger Games'', Collins drew upon [[Greek mythology]], Roman [[gladiator]]ial games, and contemporary [[reality television]] for thematic content. The novel won many awards, including the [[California Young Reader Medal]], and was named one of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''{{'}}s "Best Books of the Year" in 2008.

''The Hunger Games'' was first published in hardcover on September 14, 2008, by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], featuring a cover designed by [[Tim O'Brien (illustrator)|Tim O'Brien]]. It has since been released in paperback and also as an [[audiobook]] and [[ebook]]. After an initial print of 200,000, the book had sold 800,000 copies by February 2010. Since its release, ''The Hunger Games'' has been translated into 26 languages, and publishing rights have been sold in 38&amp;nbsp;territories. The novel is the first in [[The Hunger Games trilogy|''The Hunger Games'' trilogy]], followed by ''[[Catching Fire]]'' (2009) and ''[[Mockingjay]]'' (2010). A [[The Hunger Games (film)|film adaptation]], directed by [[Gary Ross]] and co-written and co-produced by Collins herself, was released in 2012.

==Background==
Collins has said that the inspiration for ''The Hunger Games'' came from [[channel surfing]] on television.

==Plot==
{{See also|The Hunger Games universe}}
''The Hunger Games'' takes place in a nation known as [[Panem]], established in [[North America]] after the destruction of the continent's [[civilization]] by an unknown [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] event. The nation consists of the wealthy Capitol and twelve surrounding, poorer districts under the Capitol's dictatorial control. The Capitol exploits the districts for their natural resources and cheap labour.&lt;ref&gt;Blasingame, James. "The Hunger Games." Journal of Adolescent &amp; Adult Literacy, vol. 52, no. 8, 2009, p. 724+. Academic OneFile, Accessed 6 Dec. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; [[District 12 (Hunger Games)|District&amp;nbsp;12]] is in the [[coal]]-rich region that was once [[Appalachia]], while the Capitol is in the [[Rocky Mountains]].&lt;ref name="Collins, Suzanne 2008 p. 41"&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Suzanne|year=2008|title=The Hunger Games|publisher=Scholastic|page=41|isbn=0-439-02348-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As punishment for a past [[rebellion]] against the Capitol, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual [[lottery]] to participate in the Hunger Games, a contest in which the "tributes" must fight to the death in an outdoor arena until only one remains. The event is televised.

The story is narrated by 16-year-old [[Katniss Everdeen]], a girl from District&amp;nbsp;12 who volunteers for the 74th Hunger Games in place of her 12-year-old sister, [[Primrose Everdeen|Primrose]]. The male tribute is [[Peeta Mellark]], a former schoolmate of Katniss who once gave her bread from his family's bakery when her family was starving.

Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol. In the few days before the Games start, they are advised and supported by a team consisting of their drunken mentor, [[Haymitch Abernathy]], the sole living District 12 victor of the Hunger Games; [[Effie Trinket]]; and two fashion stylists and three prep workers who help each tribute look his or her best. Katniss's stylist, [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Cinna|Cinna]], is the only person at the Capitol she considers a friend. They are also introduced to the general public, given some training, and evaluated by the Gamemakers. Katniss and, to a lesser extent, Peeta set themselves apart from the other tributes. Rue, the petite 12-year-old girl tribute from District 11, takes to following them around.

Each tribute is interviewed on television by [[Caesar Flickerman]]; they use the opportunity to try to obtain "sponsors", who can send them potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. In his interview, Peeta reveals his longtime unrequited love for Katniss. At first, Katniss believes this is simply a ploy to gain sponsors and make her let her guard down. (Much later, she comes to accept he is sincere.) Haymitch promotes their image as "[[Star-crossed|star-crossed lovers]]".

Nearly half the tributes are killed in the first day of the Games, fighting over the weapons and supplies strewn around their starting point. Katniss nearly dies, ignoring Haymitch's advice to flee immediately. She uses her well-practiced hunting and survival skills to hide in the woods. A few days later, an artificial fire drives Katniss toward the others. She is spotted and treed by the "Careers" (tributes from the richer, loyal districts who have trained intensively for the Games) ... and Peeta, who seems to have allied with them. Rue is hiding in a nearby tree. Silently, she directs Katniss's attention to a tracker jacker nest. Katniss saws through the branch holding the nest, sending it plummeting down. The venom of the flying insects kills one girl and drives the others away. However, Katniss is stung herself and begins hallucinating. Peeta returns, but instead of killing her, he tells her to run away.

She and Rue become allies and friends, but Rue is later fatally wounded by another tribute, whom Katniss kills with an arrow. Katniss sings to Rue until she dies and spreads flowers over the body to show her defiance against the Capitol. In an unprecedented move, Rue's district sends Katniss a gift of bread.

Then a rule change is announced, allowing the tributes from the same district to win as a couple. Katniss finds and nurses a seriously wounded Peeta, while continuing to act the part of a girl in love to gain gifts. When the Gamemakers announce that what each contestant needs most will be provided at a feast, Katniss risks her life to obtain medicine for Peeta. She is pinned to the ground by Clove, who gloats about Rue while toying with the helpless Katniss. That talk costs Clove her life, however; Thresh, the male District 11 tribute, kills her, but spares Katniss - once - for Rue's sake. The medicine saves Peeta's life.

Finally, Katniss and Peeta are the last two survivors, but the Gamemakers cancel the rule change in an attempt to force them into a dramatic finale, in which one must kill the other. Instead, Katniss defiantly retrieves highly poisonous "nightlock" berries and offers half to Peeta. Realizing that Katniss and Peeta intend to commit suicide, the Gamemakers announce that they are the victors of the 74th Hunger Games.

Although she receives a hero's welcome, Katniss is warned by Haymitch that she has now become a target after defying the Capitol so publicly. Afterward, Peeta is heartbroken when he learns that her actions in the arena were part of a calculated ploy to gain sympathy from the audience. However, Katniss is unsure of her own feelings.

In an interview with Collins, it was noted that the novel "tackles issues like [[severe poverty]], starvation, oppression, and the effects of war among others."&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio?show=HARDCOVER:SALE:9780439023511:12.59&amp;page=authorqa|title=Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3)|publisher=Powell's Books|accessdate=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel deals with the struggle for self-preservation that the people of Panem face in their districts and the Hunger Games in which they must participate.&lt;ref name="Dark Horse" /&gt; The citizens' starvation and their need for resources, both in and outside of the arena, create an atmosphere of helplessness that the main characters try to overcome in their fight for survival. Katniss needs to hunt to provide food for her family, resulting in the development of skills that are useful to her in the Games (such as her proficiency with the bow and arrow), and represents her rejection of the Capitol's rules in the face of life-threatening situations.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|first=Cristina|last=Hartmann|title= What, If Anything, Does The Hunger Games Series Teach Us About Strategy?|accessdate=January 11, 2012|date=October 21, 2011|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2011/10/21/what-if-anything-does-the-hunger-games-series-teach-us-about-strategy/|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of the Games' parallels with popular culture, Darren Franich of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writes that the book "is an incisive satire of reality television shows", and that the character of Cinna "almost seems like a contestant on a fascist version of ''[[Project Runway]]'', using Katniss' outfits as a vehicle to express potentially dangerous ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2010/10/06/the-hunger-games-how-reality-tv-explains-the-ya-sensation |title='The Hunger Games': How reality TV explains the YA sensation |last=Franich |first=Darren |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=October 6, 2010 |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choices the characters make and the strategies they use are often morally complex. The tributes build a personality they want the audience to see throughout the Games.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt; Library journal ''[[Voice of Youth Advocates]]'' names the major themes of ''The Hunger Games'' as "government control, '[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|big brother]]', and personal independence."&lt;ref name="barnesnoble"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/hunger-games-suzanne-collins/1100171585?ean=9780439023481|title=Barnes &amp; Noble, The Hunger Games (Editorial Reviews)|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trilogy's theme of power and downfall, similar to that of Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', was pointed out by its publisher [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]].&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.scholastic.com/content/collateral_resources/pdf/h/HungerGamesTrilogyDiscussionGuide.pdf|title=The Hunger Games trilogy Discussion Guide|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=January 2, 2010|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Miller of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' finds the author's stated premise of the Games –an exercise in propaganda and a "humiliating as well as torturous [...] punishment" for a failed uprising against the Capitol many years earlier– to be unconvincing. "You don't demoralize and dehumanize a subject people by turning them into celebrities and coaching them on how to craft an appealing persona for a mass audience." But the story works much better if the theme is vicissitudes of high school and "the adolescent social experience". Miller writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The rules are arbitrary, unfathomable, and subject to sudden change. A brutal social hierarchy prevails, with the rich, the good-looking, and the athletic lording their advantages over everyone else. To survive you have to be totally fake. Adults don't seem to understand how high the stakes are; your whole life could be over, and they act like it's just some "phase"! Everyone's always watching you, scrutinizing your clothes or your friends and obsessing over whether you're having sex or taking drugs or getting good enough grades, but no one cares who you really are or how you really feel about anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2010/06/14/100614crat_atlarge_miller?currentPage=2 |last=Miller |first=Laura |title=Fresh Hell: What's behind the boom in dystopian fiction for young readers? |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=June 14, 2010 |accessdate=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Donald Brake from ''[[The Washington Times]]'' and pastor Andy Langford state that the story has Christian themes, such as that of [[self-sacrifice]], which is found in Katniss' substitution for her younger sister, analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus as a [[Substitutionary atonement|substitute]] for the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement of sins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/worlds-best-selling-book/2012/mar/31/religious-and-political-overtones-hunger-games/|title=The religious and political overtones of Hunger Games|last=Brake|first=Donald|date=March 31, 2012|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.independenttribune.com/lifestyles/2012/mar/21/pastors-find-religious-themes-hunger-games-ar-2071082/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121021074918/http://www2.independenttribune.com/lifestyles/2012/mar/21/pastors-find-religious-themes-hunger-games-ar-2071082/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 21, 2012 |title=Pastors find religious themes in 'Hunger Games' |last=Groover |first=Jessica |date=March 21, 2012 |work=[[Independent Tribune]] |accessdate=December 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brake, as well as another reviewer, Amy Simpson, both find that the story also revolves around the theme of [[hope]], which is exemplified in the "incorruptible goodness of Katniss' sister, Primrose."&lt;ref name=Simpson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/marchweb-only/hungergamesa.html|title=Jesus in 'The Hunger Games'|last=Simpson|first=Amy|date=March 22, 2012|work=[[Christianity Today]]|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson also points to events similar to the [[Passion of Jesus]]; in the Games, "Christ figure" Peeta Mellark is stabbed after warning Katniss to flee for her life, and is then buried in the ground and placed in a cave for three days before emerging with a new lease on life.&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt; Further, she finds that the Christian image of the [[Bread of Life]] is used throughout ''The Hunger Games''; in the story, Peeta gives Katniss a loaf of bread, saving the girl and her family from starvation.&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt;

==Critical reception==
''The Hunger Games'' has received critical acclaim. In a review for ''The New York Times'', [[John Green (author)|John Green]] wrote that the novel was "brilliantly plotted and perfectly paced", and that "the considerable strength of the novel comes in Collins's convincingly detailed world-building and her memorably complex and fascinating heroine." However, he also noted that, while allegorically rich, the book sometimes does not realize the [[Allegory|allegorical]] potential that the plot has to offer and that the writing "described the action and little else."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | first=John |last=Green | title=Scary New World | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/books/review/Green-t.html | newspaper=The New York Times | date=November 7, 2008 | accessdate=December 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's review was also positive, stating that it "is a chilling, bloody and thoroughly horrifying book" and praising what it called the "hypnotic" quality of the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lev|last=Grossman|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1919156-2,00.html|title=Review: The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins|work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 7, 2009|accessdate=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Stephen King]]'s review for ''Entertainment Weekly'', he compared it to "shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames in the lobby of the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep plugging in quarters anyway."

'''Tom Williams''' (born 12 October 1983) is an [[English people|English]] former [[rugby union]] player who played for [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] in the [[Aviva Premiership]]. He normally played at either [[Fullback (rugby union)|full-back]] or on the [[Wing (rugby union)|wing]].

Williams represented Wales at U16 and U19 level, then switched to England for the 2002 IRB U19 World Cup.&lt;ref name="‘Welshman’ Williams waits for ‘Bloodgate’ decision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/rugbynation/rugby-news/2009/08/17/welshman-williams-waits-for-bloodgate-decision-91466-24455287/|title=‘Welshman’ Williams waits for ‘Bloodgate’ decision|publisher=Wales Online|date=2009-08-17|accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bloodgate==
{{main article|Bloodgate}}
During the [[2008–09 Heineken Cup#Quarter-finals|2008–09 Heineken Cup quarter final]] against [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]],  Williams was told to fake a blood injury by Dean Richards to allow a tactical substitition to reintroduce [[Nick Evans (rugby union)|Nick Evans]] leading to the bloodgate scandal.  This resulted in a 12-month ban for Williams, (reduced to four months on appeal), a three-year ban for former director of rugby [[Dean Richards (rugby union)|Dean Richards]] as well as a two-year ban for physiotherapist Steph Brennan from the [[European Rugby Cup|ERC]] with a £260,000 fine for the club.&lt;ref name="Quins escape further action in bloodgate scandal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jSXi8yJtwOWzH4F4Fd2ClRfW1-jA|title=Quins escape further action in bloodgate scandal|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|date=2009-08-24|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom remains the only one to apologise for this scandal.

'''Torball''' ([[German language|German]]: ''goal ball'') is a sport for the [[blindness|blind]] and visually impaired. It is played by two teams on opposite sides of an indoor [[playing field]]. Each team consists of three players. In the middle part of the field, there are three cords stretched across the entire width. On each end of the playing field is a goal that also stretches the entire width ({{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}}) of the field. The playing ball is similar to a soccer ball with bells inside so that it can be heard when it is rolling across the playing field.

==Description==
The object of the game is to score as many goals as possible by rolling the ball under the three cords into the goal of the opposing team. The three-player teams are both attackers and defenders during the two five-minute periods. If the ball touches one of the three cords, a penalty is called, where one player leaves the field and the remaining two players must try to defend their goal for one ‘throw’ by the opposing team.

{{Transgender sidebar}}
The participation of [[transgender]] or [[transsexual]] individuals in competitive sports is a controversial issue. Opposition to transgender or transsexual individuals competing in sporting events generally focuses on hormonal factors (such as higher testosterone levels among [[Trans woman|trans women]]), the socialisation of young men and women, and physiological factors such as height and weight. Insisting trans athletes compete against athletes of the same [[biological sex]], [[Sex verification in sports|sex verification testing]], and access regulations have been used with the aim of ensuring fair competition.

==History of transgender athletes in competition==
Historically sport has been seen as a male domain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Transgender Athletes in Competitive Sport|last=Anderson|first=Eric|last2=Travers|first2=Ann|date=2017-05-25|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781315304250|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The masculine perception of sport was first moderated with the rise of [[women's sports]] and further challenged with the gradual acceptance of [[Homosexuality in modern sports|gay sportsmen]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A third departure from this traditional view came from trans athletes, who did not fit into the culturally accepted binary gender definition of male and female.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Renée Richards ===
{{Main|Renée Richards}}
An early high-profile transgender athlete was tennis player Renée Richards. Already a promising tennis player in the mens circuit, Richards underwent [[Sex reassignment therapy|gender reassignment therapy]] in 1975 and started playing in women's tournaments a year later. Her discovery and the resulting [[media frenzy]] sparked protests.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Transgender Athletes in Competitive Sport|editor-last=Anderson|editor-first=Eric|editor-last2=Travers|editor-first2=Ann|date=2017-05-25|publisher=Routledge |year=|isbn=9781315304250|location=|pages=|language=en|first=Lindsay|last=Pieper|chapter=Advantage Renee?}}&lt;/ref&gt; After she accepted an invitation to a warm-up tournament for the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] the [[Women’s Tennis Association]] (WTA) and the [[United States Tennis Association]] (USTA) withdrew their support and 25 of the 32 women withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birrell|first=Susan|last2=Cole|first2=Cheryl L.|title=Double Fault: Renee Richards and the Construction and Naturalization of Difference|url=http://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/pdf/10.1123/ssj.7.1.1|journal=Sociology of Sport Journal|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1123/ssj.7.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USTA and WTA introduced the [[Barr body]] test, which identifies a person's sex chromosomes. Richards refused to take the test and was banned from the US Open.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She filed a lawsuit in 1977 claiming that her civil rights were violated. The judge agreed that the Barr body test as the sole determinant of sex was "grossly unfair" and ruled Richards legally female.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pieper|first=Lindsay Parks|date=2012-04-01|title=Gender Regulation: Renée Richards Revisited|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09523367.2012.675202|journal=The International Journal of the History of Sport|volume=29|issue=5|pages=675–690|doi=10.1080/09523367.2012.675202|issn=0952-3367}}&lt;/ref&gt; She competed in the 1977 Open, lost in the first round and retired four years later.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At the time, the ruling in Richards's case did not lead to major changes outside of tennis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Olympics===
In 2003, a committee convened by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) Medical Commission drew up new guidelines for participation of athletes who had undergone sex reassignment. The report listed three conditions for participation. First, athletes must have undergone [[sex reassignment surgery]], including changes in the external genitalia and [[Castration|gonadectomy]]. Second, athletes must show legal recognition of their gender. Third, athletes must have undergone hormone therapy for an appropriate time before participation, with two years being the suggested time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdga.com/files/StockholmConsensus_0.pdf |title=Statement of the Stockhold consensus on sex reassignment in sports |website=Pdga.com |date=2003 |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 2004 that the IOC allowed transsexual athletes to participate in the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sykes|first1=Heather|title=Transsexual and Transgender Policies in Sport|journal=Women in Sport and Physical Activity Journal|volume=15|issue=1|pages=3–13|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/230686774?pq-origsite=gscholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the IOC modified these guidelines in recognition that legal recognition of gender could be difficult in countries where gender transition is not legal, and also that requiring surgery in otherwise healthy individuals "may be inconsistent with developing legislation and notions of human rights".&lt;ref name="ioc2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stillmed.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Medical_commission/2015-11_ioc_consensus_meeting_on_sex_reassignment_and_hyperandrogenism-en.pdf |title=IOC consensus meeting on sex reassignment and hyperandrogenism |website=stillmed.olympic.org |date=November 2014 |accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.outsports.com/2016/1/21/10812404/transgender-ioc-policy-new-olympics|title=Exclusive: Read the Olympics' new transgender guidelines that will not mandate surgery| author=Cyd Zeigler |date=Jan 21, 2016 |website=www.outsports.com |accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new guidelines require only that trans woman athletes declare their gender and not change that assertion for four years, and demonstrate a testosterone level of less than 10 nanomoles/liter for at least one year prior to competition and throughout the period of eligibility. Athletes who transitioned from female to male were allowed to compete without restriction. These guidelines were in effect for the 2016 Rio Olympics, although no openly transgender athletes competed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/features/chris-mosier-first-trans-team-usa-member-w432272 |title=Chris Mosier First Trans Team USA Member - Rolling Stone |newspaper=Rollingstone.com |date=August 2, 2016 |author=Lauren Steele |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
The first [[Coming out|out]] transgender person to make a [[United States national team|US National Team]] was [[Chris Mosier]] who in 2016 qualified for Team USA in [[duathlon]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2017 [[Mack Beggs]], a teenager from Texas that was transitioning from female to male, was forced to wrestle in the girls state championship despite wanting to wrestle against boys. This was due to state sport regulations requiring athletes to compete alongside athletes of their birth gender. Some opponents say the testosterone prescribed as part of his transition gives him an unfair advantage and made it unsafe for the other wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/26/transgender-teenage-wrestler-mack-beggs-wins-texas-girls-title|title=Transgender teenage wrestler Mack Beggs wins Texas girls title|last=Reuters|date=2017-02-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, Rachel McKinnon won a gold medal at the cycling Masters World Track Championship in Los Angeles. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/mckinnon-is-first-transgender-woman-to-win-world-title/|title=McKinnon is First Transgender Woman to Win World Title|date=2018-10-16|work=Cyclingnews.com|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing ==
At the heart of this controversy are concerns that transgender women would outperform [[cisgender]] women due to their more masculine body structure, socialisation as males and higher [[testosterone]] levels. The intense scrutiny of transgender athletes has focused on trans women because it is generally assumed that transitioning for [[transmasculine]] individuals would not confer a competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-08-22-sport-and-gender-can-of-worms-open/|title=Sport and gender: Can of worms, open|author=Marelise van der Merwe|date=August 22, 2016|access-date=August 25, 2016|newspaper=Dailymaverick.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports organizations have sought a test for [[Sex verification in sports|sex verification]] to ensure fairness across all sports. This began in the 1940s with "femininity certificates" provided by a physician. In the 1960s, visual genital inspections were used to confirm gender, followed by chromosomal analysis to ensure that all athletes had an XX or XY chromosomal makeup. These tests were all designed to ensure that athletes were only allowed to compete as their sex, but mostly resulted in the exclusion of intersex athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/magazine/the-humiliating-practice-of-sex-testing-female-athletes.html?_r=0|title=The Humiliating Practice of Sex-Testing Female Athletes|author=Ruth Padawer|date=June 28, 2016|access-date=August 25, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently,{{When|date=April 2017}} testosterone levels have become the focus and, at the same time, new guidelines have been sought that would allow successfully-transitioned athletes to compete.&lt;ref name="ioc2015" /&gt;

==Testosterone and athletic ability==
People who oppose transgender women competing in women's sports say that they are given an unfair advantage over biological women due to their testosterone levels, and different muscle and fat distribution. Testosterone regulates many different functions in the body, including the maintenance of bone and muscle mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anawalt, MD|first1=Bradley|last2=Kirk, MD|first2=Susan|last3=Shulman, MD|first3=Dorothy|title=Endocrine Glands and Types of Hormones |url=http://www.hormone.org/hormones-and-health/the-endocrine-system/endocrine-glands-and-types-of-hormones|website=Hormone Health Network|access-date=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that athletes who transition to a woman after puberty will have a greater muscle to fat ratio compared to female athletes.&lt;ref name="sykes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sykes|first1=Heather|title=Transgender and Transsexual Policies in Sport|journal=Women in Sport &amp; Physical Activity Journal|volume=15|issue=1 |pages=3–13|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-220135981/transsexual-and-transgender-policies-in-sport|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the use of estrogen supplements and testosterone blockers (or physical castration via sex reassignment) cause a decrease in muscle mass, bone density,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} and oxygen-carrying red blood cells. This leads to a decrease in strength, speed, and endurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/do-transgender-athletes-have-an-edge-i-sure-dont/2015/04/01/ccacb1da-c68e-11e4-b2a1-bed1aaea2816_story.html |title=Do transgender athletes have an edge? I sure don't. |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=April 1, 2015 |author=Joanna Harper |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joanna Harper, a competitive runner, scientist, and transgender woman, every athlete has advantages and disadvantages. The greater height that a transgender woman may have gained before transitioning may be an advantage on the basketball court but it is likely to be disadvantageous to a gymnast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/transgender-athletes/7669902 |title=Testing, hormones, hatred: What it's like to compete as a transgender athlete - Hack - triple j |publisher=Abc.net |date=July 28, 2016 |author=Matilda Edwards |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Vilain, a professor of human genetics at UCLA and a consultant to the IOC medical commission, stated: "There is 10 to 12% difference between male and female athletic performance. We need to categorize with criteria that are relevant to performance. It is a very difficult situation with no easy solution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/olympics/2016/08/11/caster-semenya-2016-rio-olympics-track-and-field |title=Caster Semenya controversy 2016 Rio Olympics |newspaper=Sports Illustrated |date=August 11, 2016 |author=Tim Layden |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In secondary education ==
{{expand section|information about transgender children and sports in other countries|date=August 2016}}

===United States===
States vary widely on participation of transgender children in sports and which locker room those students should use. Advocates in favor of allowing transgender children to participate in sports based on their preferred gender point out the known benefits of participating in sports and the psychological well-being of the transgender children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3961696/transgender-athletes-school-sports/ |title=The Case for Allowing Transgender Athletes in Youth Sports |newspaper=Time |date=July 16, 2015 |author=Katy Steinmetz |access-date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents emphasize the same issues of an unfair advantage of larger size and strength in trans women, plus the safety of cisgender children, both in competition and in the locker room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-question-for-schools-which-sports-teams-should-transgender-students-play-on/2014/10/02/d3f33b06-49c7-11e4-b72e-d60a9229cc10_story.html |title=A question for schools: Which sports teams should transgender students play on? |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 2, 2014 |author=Sandhya Somashkhar |access-date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''York Park''' is a sports ground in the [[Inveresk and York Park Precinct, Launceston|Inveresk and York Park Precinct]], [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], [[Australia]]. Holding 21,000 people — the largest capacity stadium in [[Tasmania]] — York Park is known commercially as '''University of Tasmania Stadium'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/sport/afl/university-of-tasmania-kicks-big-goals-as-naming-rights-sponsor-of-york-park/news-story/86103d9f770817399d1bcd6d2947bd84|title=University of Tasmania kicks big goals as naming rights sponsor of York Park|publisher=The Mercury|first=Nick|last=Clark|date=22 October 2016|accessdate=24 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023062040/http://www.themercury.com.au/sport/afl/university-of-tasmania-kicks-big-goals-as-naming-rights-sponsor-of-york-park/news-story/86103d9f770817399d1bcd6d2947bd84|archive-date=23 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was formerly known as '''Aurora Stadium''' under a previous [[naming rights]] agreement signed with [[Aurora Energy]] in 2004. Primarily used for [[Australian rules football]], its record attendance of 20,971 was set in June 2006, when [[Hawthorn Football Club]] played [[Richmond Football Club]] in an [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) match.

The area was swampland before becoming Launceston's showgrounds in 1873. In the following decades the grounds were increasingly used for sports, including cricket, bowls and tennis. In 1919, plans were prepared for the transformation of the area into a multi-sports venue.  From 1923, the venue was principally used for Australian rules football by the [[Northern Tasmanian Football Association (1886 - 1986)|Northern Tasmanian Football Association]], and for occasional [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|inter-state games]]. Visiting mainland football clubs regularly played mid-season or end-of-season matches at the ground. Other sports such as cricket, tennis, bowling, cycling and foot-racing have been played at the venue.

Hawthorn has played between two and five AFL matches each season since 2001, and the [[St Kilda Football Club]] played two games a year between 2003 and 2006. In 2007, the [[Tasmanian Government]] signed a $16.4&amp;nbsp;million, five-year sponsorship deal with Hawthorn, under which the club will play four regular season games and one [[National Australia Bank Cup]] pre-season match at the venue each year.

Throughout its history, York Park has hosted major pop concerts and other entertainments. Since 2001 it has been a venue for international sports events, and in 2005 was redeveloped at a cost of $23.6&amp;nbsp;million. On 21 February 2009 York Park became home to the [[Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame]].

==History==
The area now known as York Park was originally "swampy, sour, and choked with weeds".&lt;ref name="LCC41"&gt;Green (2006), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; After European settlement, it was used for [[landfill]] before becoming the Launceston showgrounds in 1874.&lt;ref name="sponsorship"&gt;{{cite news | title = Naming rights for Tasmania's Home of Football to Tasmanian company | publisher = Aurora Energy | url = http://auroraenergy.com.au/news/default.asp?archive=yes&amp;file=27-september-2004.txt | date=27 September 2004|accessdate = 2009-07-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918154342/http://auroraenergy.com.au/news/default.asp?archive=yes&amp;file=27-september-2004.txt|archivedate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1881, {{convert|47|acre|km2|abbr=on}} of land (now York and Invermay Parks) had been taken over by the [[Launceston City Council]] "for the purpose of recreation, health and enjoyment". The area was ready to be used for two cricket games by the end of 1886. Cricketers were full of praise for the ground, but because winter rain caused it to become waterlogged, footballers (Australian rules) were often unable to use the facility.&lt;ref name="LCC41"/&gt;

At a council meeting in July 1901, one member, Alderman Storrer, proposed that Inveresk Park be renamed York Park in honour of the Duke of York (later [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]), who visited Tasmania during the [[Federation of Australia|Federation celebrations of 1901]]. The proposal was passed 4–2, although another member, Alderman Sadler, noted that "Launceston was well known as a loyal community and did not need to change the park's name"&lt;ref name="LCC42"&gt;Green (2006), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; to prove their fidelity to the monarchy. A bowling green and tennis courts were completed by 1910, along with the main [[arena|oval]] which was used for state school sports.&lt;ref name="LCC42"/&gt;
In 1919, the council held a competition for the design of the York Park sports ground, the winner to receive £20. The final design had to include two full sized tennis courts, a bowling green, a cycling track, cricket and football grounds with dressing rooms and facilities for spectators.&lt;ref name="LCC42"/&gt; Although not fully complete, York Park was officially opened by the St Andrews Caledonian Society on 1 January 1921.

On 4 May 1923 ''The Examiner'' reported on that "Work on the grandstand was completed for the opening of the 1923 football season, when the game was transferred from the [[NTCA Ground]] to York Park. Work on the grandstand and the seating round the oval has been proceeded with at top speed, and spectators at the game tomorrow should have little to complain of."&lt;ref name="LCC42"/&gt; The first game between teams representing the northern and southern halves of Tasmania took place at the oval in August 1923 in front of a crowd of 9,441. A reporter from ''The Examiner'' commented: "The oval is in good order and well grassed and the new motor mower copes with the latter very effectively under favourable conditions. The whole five acres can be cut in six hours, as compared with twenty hours by the horse mower."&lt;ref name=LCC42/&gt; When the ground was harrowed, glass and other debris would surface; a contemporary observer, John Orchard, later remembered: "they'd line up a whole group of people, perhaps thirty or forty players, and we'd go along with a container alongside each other and we'd pick up everything that was likely to hurt a player." &lt;ref name="LCC42"/&gt;

Heavy floods in 1929 caused substantial damage to the ground, destroying the cycling track, which was subsequently rebuilt.&lt;ref name="LCC42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="floods"&gt;{{cite web| title = Northern Bombers History 1921–1930 | publisher = North Launceston Football Club | url = http://www.northlauncestonfc.com.au/1921-1930.html | accessdate = 2009-06-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724081045/http://www.northlauncestonfc.com.au/1921-1930.html|archivedate=24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1930s the [[Launceston Football Club]], who played regularly at the ground, won six consecutive premierships before World War II intervened. As a consequence of the war NTFA matches were canceled after the 1941 season, not to resume until May 1945.

In 1960, York Park was the venue of a football match in which [[Tasmania Australian rules football team|Tasmania]] defeated [[Victoria Australian rules football team|Victoria]] for the first time.

Up to 1999 York Park had remained a sports ground used predominately for local events, generally attracting modest crowds; according to ground manager [[Robert Groenewegen]], supporters were able to "park [their] car[s] next to the boundary fence".&lt;ref name="historysep06" /&gt;

[[Australian rules football]] is the main sport played at the stadium which has hosted [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) games since 2001, when the state government started paying interstate clubs to relocate their home games. Melbourne-based [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] played one game in 2001 and two in 2002, and in 2003 were joined by another Melbourne team, [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]]. In 2004, it was estimated that the cost to the government per game was between $300,000 and $500,000, but Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon stated that the government was making a profit on its investment, estimating that each game injected between $1&amp;nbsp;million and $1.5&amp;nbsp;million into the Tasmanian economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/06/10/1128808.htm|title=Tas footing big bill for York Park match|date=10 June 2004|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2003/09/24/952429.htm|title=York Park kicking goals for Tas economy|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=24 September 2003|accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of AFL matches peaked in 2006, when Hawthorn played three home games and one pre-season game, while St Kilda played two home games. The games drew an average crowd of 17,108, with a record attendance of 20,971 for the match between Hawthorn and [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]].&lt;ref name= Aurora&gt;{{cite web| title = Aurora Stadium | publisher = Australia Football League | url = http://www.afl.com.au/fixture/aflvenues/tasmania/tabid/13586/default.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021053800/http://www.afl.com.au/fixture/aflvenues/tasmania/tabid/13586/default.aspx | archivedate = 21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AFL siren controversy|Controversy]] occurred at York Park when, in a game between St Kilda and [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]], the final siren was too quiet to be heard by any of the umpires; play was restarted in error, and in the subsequent confusion St Kilda levelled the scores.

==Structures and facilities==
[[File:Aurora Stadium map.png|right|thumb|wide|Stadium map|alt=York Park is located next to a road, with its biggest stand near the road. There are seven different stands surrounding the perimeter of the grassed oval, with varying shapes and sizes.]]
York Park is an oval-shaped grassed arena surrounded by several different stands, the largest being the two-tier Gunns Stand on the ground's western side. The stand originally had a capacity of 2,500, which was increased by an extension in 2005 to 5,700.&lt;ref name="York Park upgrade is flowing ahead"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aurora Anzac Day"&gt;{{cite web| title = Reserved seats sell well for Anzac Day – AFL at Aurora | publisher = ''The Examiner''  | date = 2009-04-20 | url = http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/sport/general/reserved-seats-sell-well-for-anzac-day-afl-at-aurora/1489612.aspx | accessdate = 2009-04-20}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The stand has two corporate box areas, the Gunns Function Centre and the Corporate Function Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Aurora Stadium – Event Hospitality | publisher = Aurora Stadium  | date =  | url = http://www.aurorastadiumlaunceston.com.au/content/view/17/31/ | accessdate = 2008-06-11| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080513095754/http://www.aurorastadiumlaunceston.com.au/content/view/17/31/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;| archivedate = 13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and is next to the [[Register of the National Estate|heritage listed]] Northern Stand connecting the Northern, Southern and Eastern Terraces. The stands have a collective capacity of 6,000, bringing the ground's total seating to 11,700.&lt;ref name="Council AFL Report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="$4m in federal funding for Aurora Stadium"&gt;{{cite web | title = $4m in federal funding for Aurora Stadium | publisher = ''The Examiner'' | last = Shaw | first = Rob | date = 2009-04-24 | url = http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/sport/general/4m-in-federal-funding-for-aurora-stadium/1494966.aspx | accessdate = 2009-04-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726224703/http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/sport/general/4m-in-federal-funding-for-aurora-stadium/1494966.aspx | archive-date = 26 July 2011 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Railway Workers Hill is a small, uncovered stand located at the eastern side of the ground between the Northern and Eastern Terraces. The ground has a parking capacity of approximately 2,500, from the use of  large grassy areas at the adjacent Inveresk site, with an option of street parking.&lt;ref name="Technical Information "&gt;{{cite web| title = Technical Information  | publisher = Launceston City Council | url = http://www.aurorastadiumlaunceston.com.au/city.html | accessdate = 2008-12-22| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081211091923/http://www.aurorastadiumlaunceston.com.au/city.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;| archivedate = 11 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Transport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aurora Stadium |publisher=Australian Football League |url=http://www.afl.com.au/fixture/aflvenues/tasmania/tabid/13586/default.aspx |accessdate=2009-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021053800/http://www.afl.com.au/fixture/aflvenues/tasmania/tabid/13586/default.aspx |archivedate=21 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

York Park has often been criticised for its large playing surface, which is blamed for producing unattractive low-scoring football. Prior to the start of 2009, only 11 of 28 matches saw a score beyond 100 points.&lt;ref name=Aurorashape/&gt; For a [[National Australia Bank Cup|pre-season]] match in 2009, 13&amp;nbsp;metres of width was removed from the outer wing "in a bid to produce more attractive games."&lt;ref name=boring/&gt; Before the match, Groenewegen said, "Because that outer wing was so wide, once they [a team] chipped wide out there it was very easy for teams to flood back because you were so far away from the goals."&lt;ref name="Aurorashape"&gt;{{cite web| title = Aurora changing shape | publisher = ''Herald Sun'' | last=Smith|first=Adam | date = 2009-02-18 | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/aurora-changing-shape/story-e6frf9lx-1111118890622 | accessdate = 2009-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boring"&gt;{{cite web| title = No more winging flood at Launceston's Aurora Stadium | publisher = ''Adelaide Now'' | date = 2009-02-18 | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/afl/more-news/no-more-winging-flood-at-aurora/story-e6frf9jf-1111118895697| accessdate = 26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground is also known for its strong wind, which hinders the accuracy of long-distance kicks that are propelled high into the air.&lt;ref name="Lewis to beef up Hawks for 'Dogs duel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lewis to beef up Hawks for 'Dogs duel |publisher=''Adelaide Now'' |last=Vaughan |first=Roger |date=2009-05-30 |url=http://news.theage.com.au/sport/lewis-to-beef-up-hawks-for-dogs-duel-20080530-2ju1.html |accessdate=2009-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326134808/http://news.theage.com.au/sport/lewis-to-beef-up-hawks-for-dogs-duel-20080530-2ju1.html |archivedate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A grant of $50,000 from the Tasmanian Community Fund in 2005 helped the Launceston City Council and [[AFL Tasmania]] construct a permanent [[Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame]] at York Park. The ground was chosen as the site because it is regarded as the home of Australian rules football in Tasmania.&lt;ref name="tcsf"&gt;[http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-3385-0-0-0&amp;sID=55935&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=5166138&amp;sectionID=55935 "Tasmanian Community Support Fund"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008122024/http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-3385-0-0-0&amp;sID=55935&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=5166138&amp;sectionID=55935 |date=8 October 2012 }}, AFL Tasmania, 2008-05-30, accessed 2008-12-31&lt;/ref&gt; AFL Tasmania initiated the Hall of Fame nomination process, and since 2005 various clubs, players and grounds have been inducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 2008 Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame Inductions | publisher = AFL Tasmania | date =  | url = http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-3385-0-0-0&amp;sID=55935&amp;&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=7821633&amp;sectionID=55935 | accessdate = 2009-10-09 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121010064059/http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-3385-0-0-0&amp;sID=55935&amp;&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=7821633&amp;sectionID=55935 | archive-date = 10 October 2012 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hall of Fame opened to the public on 21 February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tasmanian legends revealed to public |publisher=''The Examiner'' |date= |url=http://www.examiner.com.au/membershiprequired.aspx |accessdate=2009-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219145138/http://www.examiner.com.au/membershiprequired.aspx |archivedate=19 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2009, $23.6&amp;nbsp;million had been spent re-developing the stadium.&lt;ref name="Council AFL Report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="groundcost"/&gt;
