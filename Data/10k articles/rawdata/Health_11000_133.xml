      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1717">'''Abortion in Ecuador''' is illegal except when performed in the case of a threat to the life or health of a pregnant woman (when this threat cannot be averted by other means) or when the pregnancy is the result of a sexual crime against a [[mentally disabled]] woman and her legal representative has consented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/4944/ecuador--abortion-law&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Public Health provides guidelines on [[therapeutic abortion]].

In Ecuador, there is strong political opposition to abortion; in 2013 then president [[Rafael Correa]] threatened to resign if the abortion law was liberalized.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-24499248&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, nearly 100 criminal cases of [[illegal abortion]] were under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/22/ecuador-adopt-un-recommendations-abortion-law&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Ecuador was urged by [[CEDAW]] to decriminalize abortion in cases of rape and incest (under current law abortion in this case is legal only if the woman is mentally disabled) and severe fetal impairment (which is also illegal).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/22/ecuador-adopt-un-recommendations-abortion-law&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens''' (ACDP) is a [[UK]]-wide advisory committee. It was established in 1981, and the terms of reference were revised in 1991 to allow for a wider remit.

The terms of reference of the ACDP are:

:"To provide as requested independent scientific advice to the [[Health and Safety Executive]], and to Ministers through the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], and their counterparts under devolution in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, on all aspects of hazards and risks to workers and others from exposure to pathogens. In addition, to provide as requested independent scientific risk assessment advice on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) to Ministers through the Department of Health, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and their counterparts under devolution in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and to the [[Food Standards Agency]]."

The Committee comprises a [[Chairman]] and up to 17 members. The membership includes scientific and medical experts, representing a range of disciplines.

On 31 December 2012, the Committee was reconstituted from an advisory [[non-departmental public body]] to an Expert Advisory Committee.

==History==

According to the local folklore, Bhojtal is said to have been built by the [[Paramara]] [[Bhoja|Raja Bhoj]] during his tenure as a king of [[Malwa]] (1005–1055). He is also said to have established the city of Bhopal (also named after him, then as Bhojpal) to secure the eastern frontier of his kingdom. There is a legend why they built the lake. Once king Bhoj suffered from skin disease and all ''Vaidyas'' (Doctor in English) failed to cure him. Then, one day a [[saint]] told the king to build a tank to combine 365 tributaries and then have a bath in it to wipe out the skin disease. Bhoj called upon his engineers to build up a huge tank. They spotted a place near river [[Betwa]], which was 32&amp;nbsp;km away from Bhopal. It was found that it has only 359 tributaries. A [[Gondi people|Gond]] Commander Kalia fulfilled this shortage. He then gave the address of an invisible river.  After merging the tributaries of this river the number 365 was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url=http://bhopal.nic.in/interest.htm
   |title=Legend of Bhoj
   |accessdate=2007-04-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake was created by constructing an earthen dam across the Kolans River. An eleven gate dam called the [[Bhadbhada dam]] was constructed at Bhadbhada in 1965 at the southeast corner of the Lake, and now controls the outflow to the river Kaliasote.

The lake was known as the Upper Lake or ''Bada Talab'' ("Big Pond") until March 2011 it was renamed to Bhojtaal in honour of the Great King Raja Bhoj who built it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://hindi.oneindia.in/news/2011/03/26/big-lake-bhopal-renamed-as-bhojtaal-madhya-pradesh-aid0073.html | title = भोपाल की बड़ी झील का नाम हुआ भोजताल | language = Hindi | date = 2011-03-26 | accessdate = 2011-10-28 | publisher = OneIndia }}&lt;/ref&gt; A huge statue of Raja Bhoj, standing with sword, was also installed on a pillar on one corner of the lake to cement the name of Bhopal as the city of lakes&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=713571 Bhopal May Become Bhojpal Soon]. [[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]], 1 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016 :Bhopal Upper Lake dam gates opened so early in July after 38 years.

==Geography==
Bhojtal is situated on the west central part of Bhopal city and is surrounded by [[Van Vihar National Park]] on the south, human settlements on the east and north, and agriculture fields on the west.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; It has an area of 31&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and drains a catchment or watershed of 361&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The watershed of the Upper Lake is mostly rural, with some urbanized areas around its eastern end. The Kolans was formerly a tributary of the [[Halali River]], but with the creation of the lake using an earthen dam and a diversion channel, the upper reach of the Kolans River and Bada Talaab now drain into the Kaliasote River.

==Social and cultural significance==
Since the construction of the lake in the 11th century, Bhopal city has grown around it. The people are religiously and culturally attached to the lakes. The lakes meet their needs of water supply and they wash clothes in them (very harmful for the lake ecosystem), cultivate water chestnut in Bhojtal and lotus in Chhota Talaab. The idols of gods and goddesses are also immersed in the lake during religious festivals, though the local administration is advising devotees not to do so. The Takia island in Upper lake has a tomb of the Shah Ali Shah Rahamatullah Alla, which has religious and archaeological significance.&lt;ref name=WWF-2&gt;{{cite web

==Economy and entertainment==
[[File:UpperLake.jpg|thumb|right|Tourists in Bhojtal]]
The fishing rights to Bhojtal have been given on long lease by the Bhopal Municipal Corporation to a co-operative consisting of some 500 fishermen families. Fishing is mainly done on its south-eastern shores. The lake also serves as the source of water for irrigating a large area. There are 87 villages in its catchment area in the Bhopal as well as Sehore districts. Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for people in these areas and most farmers have livestock as well. While some farmers have large landholdings, many farmers are small and marginal farmers with only a few acres of land.&lt;ref name=environment_incentives-2&gt;{{cite web

Bhojtal attracts tourists due to its scenic beauty. The National Sailing School was established at the Boat Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The road passing through it has on one side the animals in their natural habitats, and on the other hand is the scenic beauty of the lake.

The other major attraction close to the lake is the Bhopal Zoo on the bank of the lake. This makes the lake a complete entertainment location for all visitors. The zoo is kept in quite natural way.

==Biodiversity==
[[File:Sarus cranecropped.jpg|thumb|Indian sarus crane]]
The two lakes support flora and fauna. [[White stork]], [[stork|blacknecked stork]], [[goose|barheaded goose]], [[spoonbill]] etc., that have been rare sightings in the past, have started appearing. A recent phenomenon is the gathering of 100-120 sarus [[Crane (bird)|cranes]] in the lake. The largest bird of India, [[sarus crane]] (''Grus antigone'') is known for its size, majestic flight and lifetime pairing.&lt;ref name=WWF-3&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12246">'''Corneal keratocytes''' ('''corneal fibroblasts''') are specialized [[fibroblast]]s residing in the [[corneal stroma|stroma]]. This [[cornea]]l layer, representing about 85-90% of corneal thickness, is built up from highly regular collagenous lamellae and extracellular matrix components. Keratocytes play the major role in keeping it transparent, healing its wounds, and synthesizing its components. In the unperturbed cornea keratocytes stay dormant, coming into action after any kind of injury or inflammation. Some keratocytes underlying the site of injury, even a light one, undergo [[apoptosis]] immediately after the injury.&lt;!--

--&gt; Any glitch in the precisely orchestrated process of healing may cloud the cornea, while excessive keratocyte apoptosis may be a part of the pathological process in the degenerative corneal disorders such as [[keratoconus]], and these considerations prompt the ongoing research into the function of these cells.

==Origin and functions==
Keratocytes are developmentally derived from the cranial population of [[neural crest]] cells, from whence they migrate to settle in the [[mesenchyme]]. In some species the migration from neural crest comes in two waves, with the first giving birth to the [[corneal endothelium]] and the second invading the epithelium-secreted stromal anlage devoid of cells; in other species both populations come from a single wave of migration. Once settled in the stroma, keratocytes start synthesizing collagen molecules of different types (I, V, VI) and [[keratan sulfate]]. By the moment of eye opening after birth the proliferation of keratocytes is all but finished and most of them are in the quiescent state.&lt;!--

According to one study, average keratocyte density in the human stroma is about 20500 cells per mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 9600 in a column of 1&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in section. The highest density is observed in the upper 10% of the stroma. The number of keratocytes declines with age, at a rate approximately 0.45% per year.&lt;!--

After an injury to the cornea, some keratocytes undergo apoptosis, prompted by the signaling molecules secreted by the upper layers, such as [[IL1A|IL1 alpha]] and [[TNF-alpha]]. Other neighbouring keratocytes, when acted upon by the same molecules, become active, proliferate and start synthesizing [[matrix metalloproteinase]]s that cause tissue remodeling. These activated cells are designated in different sources either as "active keratocytes" or "fibroblasts" or are said to assume a "repair phenotype". After heavier injuries or at the advanced stages of healing process a number of keratocytes transforms into [[myofibroblast]]s actively secreting [[extracellular matrix|ECM]] components; this transformation is thought to be caused by [[TGF-beta]]. As soon as the [[basement membrane]] of [[corneal epithelium]] is restored, [[TGF beta]] inflow into the stroma drastically decreases and myofibroblasts disappear, after which the remaining activated keratocytes continue for some time to reshape the extracellular matrix, secreting [[IL1A|IL1-alpha]] in order to maintain their "repair phenotype".&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17655845" /&gt;

[[Apoptosis]] of keratocytes, either in quiescent or active state, is a process that attracts special attention. In a healthy [[cornea]] the programmed [[Cell (biology)|cell]] [[death]] is a rare occasion, but immediately after an [[injury]] to the uppermost layer keratocytes directly under the injury site commit apoptosis.&lt;!--

--&gt; One [[hypothesis]] explains such rapid reaction by the need to stem the possible [[infection]] from spreading into the cornea, because due to the limitations of [[ocular immune system]] the [[immune cells]] take up to several [[hour]]s to arrive at the site of injury.&lt;!--

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2041">[[File:Spee.png| thumb|Curve of Spee]]
In [[anatomy]], the '''Curve of Spee''' (called also '''von Spee's curve''' or '''Spee's curvature''') is defined as the [[curvature]] of the mandibular [[occlusal plane]] beginning at the premolar and following the buccal [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]]s of the posterior [[teeth]], continuing to the terminal [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]. According to another definition the curve of Spee is an anatomic curvature of the occlusal alignment of the teeth, beginning at the tip of the lower incisor, following the buccal cusps of the natural premolars and molars and continuing to the anterior border of the ramus. It is named for the German embryologist Ferdinand Graf von Spee (1855–1937), who was first to describe the anatomic relations of human teeth in the sagittal plane.

==Details==
The pull of the main muscle of mastication, the [[masseter]], is at a perpendicular angle with the curve of Spee to adapt for favorable loading of force on the teeth.
The long axis of each lower tooth is aligned nearly parallel to their individual arch of closure. 
The Curve of Spee is, essentially, a series of sloped contact points. It is of importance to orthodontists as it may contribute to an increased overbite. A flat or mild curve of Spee was essential to an ideal occlusion.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Andrews. 1972. ''Six Keys to Normal Occlusion.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Curve of Spee is distinct from the Curve of Wilson, which is the upward (U-shaped) curvature of the maxillary and mandibular occlusal planes in the coronal plane.

The Curve of Spee is basically a part of a circle (8-inch diameter) which has its circumference as the anterior ramus of mandible. Ideally, it is aligned so that a continuation of this arc would extend through the condyles.  The curvature of this arc would relate, on average, to part of a circle with a  4-inch radius. It is the only Anteroposterior curve of occlusion.

'''David Steven Viscott''' (May 24, 1938 – October 10, 1996) was an American [[psychiatrist]], author, businessman, and media personality. He was a graduate of [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] (1959), Tufts Medical School and taught at [[Boston University|University Hospital]] in [[Boston]]. He started a private practice in psychiatry in 1968 and later moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in 1979 where he was a professor of psychiatry at [[UCLA]]. He founded and managed the Viscott Center for Natural Therapy in [[Beverly Hills]], [[Newport Beach]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first=Wolfgang |last=Saxon |title=David Viscott, Psychotherapist Of the Airwaves, Is Dead at 58 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/20/us/david-viscott-psychotherapist-of-the-airwaves-is-dead-at-58.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
In 1980 Viscott began presenting his own full-time show on [[talk radio]], and was notably one of the first psychiatrists to do so (talk station [[KABC radio|KABC]]). He screened telephone calls and gave considerable amount of free psychological counselling to his on-air "patients."

In 1987 Viscott briefly had his own live [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[television|TV]] show, ''Getting in Touch with Dr. David Viscott'', providing much the same service as his radio show. In fact, the shows ran concurrently. In the early 1990s he had a weekly call-in therapy television program on [[KNBC]] in Los Angeles early Sunday morning after [[Saturday Night Live]], titled ''Night Talk with Dr. David Viscott''.

Viscott's signature style was to attempt to isolate an individual's source of emotional problems in a very short amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-26/magazine/tm-22135_1_david-viscott |title=The David Viscott You Didn't Know |first=Nora |last=Zamichow |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 26, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his books were of a self-help nature, written to assist the individual with his/her own examination of life. His autobiography, ''The Making of a Psychiatrist'', was a best-seller, a [[Book of the Month Club]] Main Selection, and nominated for the [[Pulitzer Prize]].

Along with [[psychiatric]] advice, he would fall back on his medical knowledge to regularly devote entire segments of radio to answering [[medical]] questions. During these segments he would give medical advice. Many of the questions answered had to do with [[pharmacological]] advice. This was unique in the world of talk radio.

Viscott's popularity peaked in the early 1990s, and then fell sharply. A separation from his wife, followed by declining health, occurred at about the same time that he left the air waves. He died in 1996 of [[heart failure]] complicated by a [[diabetic]] condition. At the time, he was living alone in Los Angeles. He is survived by three of his children; Elizabeth, Penelope, and Jonathan. His daughter Melanie Random took her own life in February, 2015.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==''The Simpsons''==
In the television show ''[[The Simpsons]]'', the character Dr. Marvin Monroe's voice was based on Viscott.&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt (2001). Commentary for "[[There's No Disgrace Like Home]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Monroe has been retired since the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]] because voicing the character strained Shearer's throat.&lt;ref&gt;Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|Some Enchanted Evening]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The character's retirement was marked by the broadcast of a Dr. Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital over [[#Eddie and Lou|Lou]]'s walkie-talkie in "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)]]".&lt;ref&gt;Oakley, Bill (2005). Commentary for "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, several references to Monroe being dead have been made: a glimpse of his gravestone in "[[Alone Again, Natura-Diddily]]", a Dr. Marvin Monroe Memorial Gymnasium seen in "[[Bye Bye Nerdie]]", and a trivia interstitial in the "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular|138th Episode Spectacular]]" regarding which popular characters had recently died. However, Monroe is seen alive in the [[The Simpsons (season 15)|fifteenth season]] in "[[Diatribe of a Mad Housewife]]" purchasing a copy of Marge's novel, ''The Harpooned Heart'', stating simply that he had "...been very sick" when asked about his long absence by Marge. He was later seen as a ghost, claiming that he was "stuck in limbo" in "[[Treehouse of Horror XXV]]".

In dentistry, '''debridement''' refers to the removal by [[Teeth_cleaning|dental cleaning]] of accumulations of [[dental plaque|plaque]] and [[calculus (dental)|calculus]] (tartar) in order to maintain dental health.&lt;ref name="P&amp;S"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Page |first1=RC |last2=Schroeder |first2=HE |title=Pathogenesis of inflammatory periodontal disease. A summary of current work |journal=Laboratory Investigation |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=235–49 |year=1976 |pmid=765622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Dental debridement is a procedure by which [[dental plaque|plaque]] and [[calculus (dental)|calculus]] (tartar) that have accumulated on the teeth is removed.&lt;ref name="P&amp;S" /&gt; Debridement may be performed in the process of personal or professional [[teeth cleaning]].  [[Teeth_cleaning#Professional_teeth_cleaning|Professional]] [[Scaling_and_root_planing|debridement techniques]] include the use of ultrasonic instruments (which fracture the calculus, thereby facilitating its removal), as well as the use of hand tools, including [[periodontal scaler]] and [[periodontal curette|curettes]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Debridement may also be performed using saline solution. {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}.

== Procedures ==
'''Periodontal Pockets'''

A periodontal pocket is formed from a disease process; it is defined as the apical extension of the gingiva, resulting in detachment of the periodontal ligament (PDL).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Newman, Michael G. (2012). Carranza’s Clinical Periodontology. St. Louis: Saunders/Elsevier.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PDL is a ligament that attaches the root of the tooth to the supporting alveolar bone. This ligament allows for occlusal force absorption. Plaque accumulates within the pocket initiating an inflammatory response due to an increased number of spirochetes. There are different types of bacteria that make up dental plaque. In cases of aggressive periodontitis three major species of bacteria have been identified within the periodontal pocket. These bacteria include Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Healthy gingiva consists of few microorganisms, mostly coccoid cells and straight rods. Diseased gingiva consists of increased numbers of spirochetes and mobile rods.Interactions between plaque and host inflammatory response determine the alterations in pocket depths.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Boyd, Linda D.; Giblin, Lori; Chadbourne, Dianne (2012). “Bidirectional relationship between diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease: State of the evidence”. Can J Dent Hyg. 46: 93-102.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial plaque initiates a nonspecific host inflammatory response with the intention of eliminating necrotic cells and harmful bacteria. During this process cytokines, proteinases, and prostaglandins are produced which can cause damage, or kill healthy tissues such as macrophages, fibroblasts, neutrophiles, and epithelial cells.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The exposure to connective tissue and blood capillaries, allows microorganisms to gain an entryway to the circulation. This suppresses host protection mechanisms, leading to further destruction of bone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Periodontal pockets may occur from either coronal swelling or apical migration.Pockets that occur due to coronal swelling with no clinical attachment loss are considered pseudopockets.There are two types of periodontal pockets that are determined by the type of bone loss present. A suprabony pocket occurs when there is horizontal bone loss, the bottom of the pocket is coronal to the alveolar bone. An infrabony pocket occurs when there is vertical bone loss where the bottom of the pocket is apical to the alveolar bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nield-Gehrig, Jill S.; Willmann, Donald E (2011). Foundations of Periodontics for the Dental Hygienist. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical signs of periodontal pockets include bluish-red, thickened gingiva, gingival bleeding, localized pain and in some cases exudate. Periodontal pockets can cause the loosening and loss of dentition due to destruction of supporting tissues including the alveolar bone, PDL and gingival tissue. Clinical diagnosis of periodontal pockets is achieved from full mouth periodontal probing performed by a dentist or dental hygienist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Newman, Michael; Takei, Henry; Klokkevold, Perry; Carranza, Fermin (2015). Carranza’s Clinical Periodontology. St. Louis: Saunders/Elsevier.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment of periodontal pocketing requires professional and at home intervention. At home treatment for periodontal pockets include meticulous and routine plaque removal by brushing and interproximal cleaning. Professional treatment includes routine dental visits for debridement, scaling and root planing. Clinical treatment goals are set to control the inflammatory disease by removal of coronal and subgingival plaque containing destructive pathogens. With the consistent and complete removal of biofilm, the infection can be arrested and healthy periodontium can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arabaci, Taner; Cicek, Yasin; Canakci, Cenk F. (2007). “Sonic and ultrasonic scalers in periodontal treatment: a review”. Int J Dent Hyg. 5: 2-12.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major risk factor of a periodontal pocket is smoking as it affects the severity and prevalence of pockets. Tobacco cessation is a necessary intervention to motivate patients to quit smoking and achieve periodontal health.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Smoking also delays the healing process once debridement, scaling, root planing and adequate home care has been completed.

Healing of periodontal pockets are shown by a reduction in pocket depth. Although pocket depths can be reduced by decreasing inflammation, it is important note that large changes will not occur. Two ways in which periodontal pocket reduction can occur is by either non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) or surgical periodontal therapy. NSPT includes but is not limited to initial debridement, scaling, root planing, antibiotic treatment, and oral health education. If periodontal pocket depths are not controlled and maintained with NSPT during a re-evaluation appointment then surgical periodontal therapy is necessary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Surgical periodontal therapy creates a stable and maintainable environment for the patient by eliminating pathological changes in the pockets.The overall purpose of surgical therapy is to eliminate the pathogenic plaque in pocket walls to get a stable and easily maintainable state. This can promote periodontal regeneration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Periodontal Scalers'''

Professional periodontal therapy includes initial debridement, scaling and root planing with specific periodontal instruments. These instruments include files, curettes, after fives and mini fives used for mechanical debridement.The shank of periodontal instruments can either be rigid, which works better with heavy and tenacious calculus or flexible for fine tuning and light deposit.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nield-Gehrig Jill (2012). Fundamentals of Periodontal Instrumentation &amp; Advanced Root Instrumentation. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodontal files are used to crush larger, tenacious deposits to prepare them for further debridement with a scaler, curette or ultrasonic scalers. They have a series of blades on a base, therefore they are not suitable for root planing and fine scaling.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Universal curettes are double-ended instruments with paired mirror working ends and a rounded toe. These instruments can be used on all surfaces of the tooth including root surfaces in a periodontal pocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Darby, Michele; Walsh Margaret (2015). Dental Hygiene: Theory and Practice. St. Louis: W.B. Saunders Company.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gracey curettes have a stronger, rigid shank and angulated working blades that are area specific. They are best for subgingival scaling and root planing because the offset blade allowing for greater adaptation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After fives are similar to gracey’s except they have an extended shank to allow extension into deeper pockets (&gt;5mm). They also have a thinner blade for heavy or tenacious calculus.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Mini fives are a modification of after fives as their blades are half the length to allow for easier insertion and adaptation into deep pockets, furcations, developmental grooves and line angles. They also contribute to a reduction in tissue trauma.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ultrasonic scalers move in an elliptical motion and do not have a cutting edge. They operate at a frequency of 3,000-8,000 cycles per second and use magnetostrictive or piezo-electric technology, thus helping remove plaque and calculus while reducing operator wrist fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Drisko CL, Cochran DL, Blieden T, Bouwsma OJ, Chen RE, Damoulis P, Fine JB, Greenstein G, Hinrichs J, Somerman MJ, Lacono V, Genco RJ (2000).

'''Diabetes Australia''' is the third oldest [[diabetes]] association in the world, after the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Portugal]].  Originally established in the state of New South Wales ([[NSW]]) in 1937, the organisation's head office is now in the nation's capital, [[Canberra]].  Currently a federation of ten operational organisations is overseen: five State/Territory Associations of Diabetes Australia, the Australian Diabetes Society, the Australian Diabetes Educators Association, the Kellion Diabetes Foundation and The Diabetes Research Foundation - Western Australia.

Diabetes Australia is a [[not-for-profit organisation]] supported financially by the community. In addition to its original mandate as an extended support group, Diabetes Australia raises funds to invest in research, health services, provision of self–management products and services, and public awareness programs. It also facilitates the development of national policies about diabetes.

Diabetes Australia assists the Australian Government in the administration of the National Diabetes Services Scheme.&lt;ref name="ndss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndss.com.au/ |title=National Diabetes Services Scheme |date=29 June 2012 |accessdate=23 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of purpose==
Diabetes Australia works in partnership with diabetes health professionals, educators and researchers to minimise the impact of diabetes on the Australian community. Diabetes Australia is committed to turning diabetes around through awareness, prevention, detection, management and a cure.

Diabetes Australia raises awareness about the seriousness of diabetes, promotes prevention and early detection strategies and advocates for better standards of care. Diabetes Australia is also a significant financial contributor to research into better treatments for diabetes and the search for a cure.

==Publications and research==
Diabetes Australia is involved in two publications, one for medical specialists, and another for the broader public.

''Circle'' is a quarterly magazine covering health and welfare issues for people with diabetes, and available through membership of Diabetes Australia including state and territory based member-organisations.  Circulation is around 140,000.

''Diabetes Management Journal'' (DMJ) is a free magazine containing information and advice for [[general practitioners]], [[endocrinologist]]s, diabetes educators, [[optometrists]] and [[podiatrist]]s, who receive it through their professional associations. Its circulation is around 40,000.

In March 2012, the organisation released a report called ''[https://static.diabetesaustralia.com.au/s/fileassets/diabetes-australia/e7282521-472b-4313-b18e-be84c3d5d907.pdf Diabetes: the silent pandemic and its impact on Australia]''.  The report highlighted the statistic that 275 Australians were diagnosed with diabetes every day and that by 2025, [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] is predicted to triple in prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/gen-y-becoming-diabetes-generation/story-e6frfkvr-1226298793696 |title=Gen Y becoming diabetes generation  |author= |accessdate=23 July 2012 |date=14 March 2012 |work=news.com.au |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statistics from the [[International Diabetes Federation|International Diabetes Federation's]] 2015 [http://www.diabetesatlas.org/across-the-globe.html Diabetes Atlas] show that diabetes is on the rise. Mr Johnson, the CEO of Diabetes Australia, said that 280 people are diagnosed with the diabetes in Australia every day and Australia's health system will not cope unless more is done about prevention of the disease. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-12/diabetes-australia-warns-health-system-at-risk/6935878|title=Diabetes Australia warns urgent action needed to save nation's health system from 'epidemic'|last=Timms|first=Penny|date=2015-11-12|work=|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2016-06-01|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Employment Standards Act''' is an Act of the Legislature of [[Ontario]]. which regulates employment in the province, including wages, maximum work hours, and workplace health and safety. It differs from the Ontario Labour Relations Act, which regulates unionized labour in Ontario.

The '''[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00e41?_ga=1.45284772.129170348.1456077119 Employment Standards Act]'''[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00e41?_ga=1.45284772.129170348.1456077119 , 2000 (ESA)], sets out the minimum standards that employers and employees must  follow in regards to:
* Continuity of employment
* Payment of wages
* Records
* Hours of work and eating periods
* Overtime pay
* [[List of minimum wages by country|Minimum wage]] &lt;ref&gt;http://canlii.ca/en/on/laws/stat/so-2000-c-41/latest/so-2000-c-41.html#sec22.2subsec3&lt;/ref&gt;
* Public holidays
* Vacation with pay
* Equal pay for equal work
* Benefits plans
* Leaves of absence (Pregnancy Leave, [[Parental leave]], Family medical leave, Organ donor leave, Personal emergency leave, Emergency leave, declared emergencies, Reservist leave)
* Termination and severance of employment
* Lie detectors
* Retail business establishments
* Reprisal
* Temporary help agencies
* Building services providers

==Uses==
The Ministry of Labour administers the ESA and its regulations by:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/es/pubs/guide/molrole.php|title = Role of the Ministry of Labour|date = |access-date = |website = Ontario Ministry of Labour|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* providing compliance support
* conducting proactive inspections of payroll records and workplace practices to ensure the ESA is being followed
* investigating and resolving complaints
* enforcing the  and its regulations

=== &lt;u&gt;Compliance Support&lt;/u&gt; ===
The Ministry of Labour offers publications and services to help employees and employers understand their rights and comply with their obligations. These include an employment standards poster, which employers are required to post in their workplaces; a catalogue of fact sheets and information sheets covering a variety of topics; and interactive online tools and calculators to assist employers and employees to understand provisions of the ESA, such as the Termination Tool, the Public Holiday Pay Calculator and the Severance Tool.

=== &lt;u&gt;Proactive Inspections&lt;/u&gt; ===
Employment standards officers conduct proactive inspections of payroll and other records, including a review of employment practices. An officer performing a proactive inspection will usually visit the employer's business location. Officers may notify the employer in writing before the inspection, but are not required to. A notice may set out a list of records and other documents the employer must provide during the inspection. The employer is required to produce the records requested and must answer questions that the officer thinks may be relevant. An officer is able to take away records or other information for review and copying.

=== &lt;u&gt;Investigating Complaints&lt;/u&gt; ===
In most cases, employees should attempt to contact their employer or former employer (or the client of a temporary help agency, if applicable) about the employment standards right(s) they believe have been violated. However, there might be a good reason for an employee to not contact their employer (e.g. If the employee is afraid to contact the employer or he or she is a young employee).

Employees have an opportunity to tell the ministry on the Claim Form why they did not contact their employer, or that they have already contacted their employer. If the employer contacted the employer but the issue was not resolved, the employee does not have to contact his or her employer again. If the parties are unable to resolve the issue on their own, and if the employee has provided all the required information on the Claim Form, the matter is assigned to an employment standards officer for investigation.

The employment standards officer may conduct his or her investigation by telephone, through written correspondence, by visiting the employer's premises or by requiring the employee and/or the employer to attend a meeting. During an investigation, both parties have the opportunity to present the facts and arguments they believe are important to their case. If a claim has been submitted against the client of a temporary help agency regarding a possible reprisal or unpaid wages, employment standards officers have the same powers of investigation with respect to the client as they do for an employer.

The officer will make a decision based on the best available evidence which may include employer records, client records, employee records, and interviews.After investigating a claim, the employment standards officer makes a decision about whether the employer '''has''' or '''has not''' followed the ESA; If the officer finds that the employer '''has''' complied with the ESA :
* The employee is notified in writing of this decision, and can apply for a review within 30 days. If the officer finds that the employer '''has not''' complied with the ESA :
* The employer or the client of a temporary help agency may resolve the issue by voluntarily complying with the officer's decision (&lt;abbr&gt;i.e.&lt;/abbr&gt;, by paying money that is owing to an employee or employees, or by adopting new, or changing existing, workplace practices).
* Issue an order against the employer. (For more information, see "Enforcement", below.)
* Officers can also require an employer to post a notice containing specific information about administration or enforcement of the ESA, and/or a copy of the report or part of the report with the officer's findings.
Some small business owners have complained that the ESA treats them as though they were criminals.
There are records of employees using the ESA to abuse their employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adami |first=Hugh |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/business/Labour+ministry+puts+squeeze+small+business+wronged+fired/7281170/story.html |title=Adami: Labour ministry puts squeeze on small business wronged by fired worker |publisher=Ottawacitizen.com |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2012-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924034237/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/business/Labour+ministry+puts+squeeze+small+business+wronged+fired/7281170/story.html |archivedate=2012-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exertion''' is the [[Action (physics)|physical]] or perceived use of [[energy]].&lt;ref name=":07"&gt;Newton's Third Law, Elert, Glenn. “Forces.” ''Viscosity – The Physics Hypertextbook'', physics.info/newton-first/.&lt;/ref&gt; Exertion traditionally connotes a strenuous or costly ''effort,''resulting in generation of force, initiation of motion,&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt; or in the performance of [[Mechanical work|work]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; It often relates to [[Exercise physiology|muscular]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;activity and can be quantified, empirically and by measurable metabolic response.

==Physical==
In [[physics]], ''exertion'' is the expenditure of [[energy]] against, or inductive of, [[inertia]] as described by [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s third law|third law of motion]]. In physics, '''force''' exerted equivocates '''work''' done.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Perceived Exertion, Barry, A. J. (1967). Physical activity and psychic stress/strain. ''Canadian Medical Association Journal'', ''96''(12), 848–853.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to do work can be either positive or negative depending on the direction of exertion relative to gravity. For example, a force exerted upwards, like lifting an object, creates positive work done on that object.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physics.bu.edu/~duffy/py105/Energy.html|title=Work and energy|website=physics.bu.edu|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exertion often results in force generated, a contributing dynamic of general motion.&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt; In [[mechanics]] it describes the use of [[force]] against a [[Physical body|body]] in the direction of its [[Motion (physics)|motion]] (see [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]).

==Physiological==
Exertion, physiologically, can be described by the initiation of exercise, or, intensive and exhaustive physical activity that causes cardiovascular stress or a sympathetic nervous response. This can be continuous or intermittent exertion.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Exertion requires, of the body, modified oxygen uptake, increased heart rate, and autonomic monitoring of blood [[Lactate dehydrogenase|lactate]] concentrations. Mediators of physical exertion include cardio-respiratory and [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]] strength, as well as metabolic capability.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Kumar, Shrawan. “Theories of Occupational Musculoskeletal Injury Causation.” ''Biomechanics in Ergonomics, Second Edition'', July 2007, doi:10.1201/9780849379093.sec1.&lt;/ref&gt; This often correlates to an output of force followed by a [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] of recovery. Exertion is limited by cumulative load and repetitive motions.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Muscular energy reserves, or stores for [[Biomechanics|biomechanical]] exertion, stem from metabolic, immediate production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and increased O2 consumption.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Muscular exertion generated depends on the muscle length and the velocity at which it is able to shorten, or contract.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;“Golgi Tendon Organ.” ''Egyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics'', Elsevier, www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/golgi-tendon-organ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perceived exertion can be explained as subjective, perceived experience that mediates response to somatic sensations and mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A [[rating of perceived exertion]], as measured by the ''RPE-scale'', or [[Borg scale]], is a quantitative measure of physical exertion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borg|first=Gunnar A.V|date=|title=Psychophysical bases of perceived exertion|url=http://fcesoftware.com/images/15_Perceived_Exertion.pdf|journal=Symposium|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often in health, exertion of oneself resulting in cardiovascular stress showed reduced physiological responses, like cortisol levels and mood, to stressors. Therefore, biological exertion is effective in mediating psychological exertion, responsive to environmental stress.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Gröpel, Peter, et al. “Endurance- and Resistance-Trained Men Exhibit Lower Cardiovascular Responses to Psychosocial Stress Than Untrained Men.” ''Frontiers in Psychology'', vol. 9, Jan. 2018, doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00852.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overexertion causes more than 3.5 million injuries a year.{{Clarify|reason=when, where|date=November 2018}} An overexertion injury can include sprains or strains, the stretching and tear of ligaments, tendons, or muscles caused by a load that exceeds the human ability to perform the work.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;“Indications Of Physical Overexertion.” ''JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association'', vol. 71, no. 18, Feb. 1918, p. 1488., doi:10.1001/jama.1918.02600440040013.&lt;/ref&gt; Overexertion, besides causing acute injury, implies physical exertion beyond the person's capacity which leads to symptoms such as dizziness, irregular breathing and heart rate, and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; Preventative measures can be taken based on biomechanical knowledge to limit possible overexertion injuries.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;“The Understated Injury: Overexertion.” ''Healthline'', Healthline Media, www.healthline.com/health/understated-injury-overexertion.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Female genital mutilation''' ('''FGM'''), also known as '''female genital cutting''' and '''female circumcision''',{{efn|[[Martha Nussbaum]] (''Sex and Social Justice'', 1999): "Although discussions sometimes use the terms 'female circumcision' and 'clitoridectomy', 'female genital mutilation' (FGM) is the standard generic term for all these procedures in the medical literature&amp;nbsp;... The term 'female circumcision' has been rejected by international medical practitioners because it suggests the fallacious analogy to male circumcision&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Nussbaum|1999|loc=119}}}} is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the [[external female genitalia]]. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. [[UNICEF]] estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2016/&gt;

Typically carried out by a traditional circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut before the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;For the circumcisers and blade: [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 2, 44–46; for the ages: 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Procedures differ according to the country or [[ethnic group]]. They include removal of the [[clitoral hood]] and [[clitoral glans]]; removal of the [[Labia minora|inner labia]]; and removal of the inner and [[Labia majora|outer labia]] and closure of the [[vulva]]. In this last procedure, known as [[#Type III|infibulation]], a small hole is left for the passage of urine and [[Menstruation|menstrual fluid]]; the [[vagina]] is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}

The practice is rooted in [[gender inequality]], attempts to control [[human female sexuality|women's sexuality]], and ideas about purity, modesty and beauty. It is usually initiated and carried out by women, who see it as a source of honour and fear that failing to have their daughters and granddaughters cut will expose the girls to [[social exclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 15; {{harvnb|Toubia|Sharief|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse health effects depend on the type of procedure; they can include recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, [[chronic pain]], the development of [[cyst]]s, an inability to get pregnant, complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} There are no known health benefits.&lt;ref name=WHO2018health&gt;[[#WHO2018|WHO 2018]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been international efforts since the 1970s to persuade practitioners to abandon FGM, and it has been outlawed or restricted in most of the countries in which it occurs, although the laws are poorly enforced. Since 2010 the [[United Nations]] has called upon healthcare providers to stop performing all forms of the procedure, including [[#reinfibulation|reinfibulation]] after childbirth and symbolic "nicking" of the clitoral hood.&lt;ref name=UN2010Askew&gt;[[#UN2010|UN 2010]]; {{harvnb|Askew|Chaiban|Kalasa|Sen|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition to the practice is not without its critics, particularly among [[Anthropology|anthropologists]], who have raised difficult questions about [[cultural relativism]] and the universality of [[human rights]].{{sfn|Shell-Duncan|2008}}

==Terminology==
[[File:Samburu female circumcision ceremony, Kenya.jpg|thumb|left|alt=photograph|[[Samburu people|Samburu]] FGM ceremony, [[Laikipia County|Laikipia]] plateau, Kenya, 2004]]

Until the 1980s FGM was widely known in English as female circumcision, implying an equivalence in severity with [[male circumcision]].{{sfn|Nussbaum|1999|loc=119}} From 1929 the [[National Council of Churches of Kenya|Kenya Missionary Council]] referred to it as the sexual mutilation of women, following the lead of [[Marion Stevenson|Marion Scott Stevenson]], a [[Church of Scotland]] missionary.{{sfn|Karanja|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=F1ezIgyomGIC&amp;pg=PA93 93], n.&amp;nbsp;631}} References to the practice as mutilation increased throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name=WHO2008pp4,22&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 4, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American anthropologist, used the term ''female genital mutilation'' in the title of a paper in ''American Ethnologist'',{{sfn|Hayes|1975}} and four years later [[Fran Hosken]], an Austrian-American feminist writer, called it mutilation in her influential ''The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females''.{{sfn|Hosken|1994}} The [[Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children]] began referring to it as female genital mutilation in 1990, and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) followed suit in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Other English terms include ''female genital cutting'' (FGC) and ''female genital mutilation/cutting'' (FGM/C), preferred by those who work with practitioners.&lt;ref name=WHO2008pp4,22/&gt;

In countries where FGM is common, the practice's many variants are reflected in dozens of terms, often alluding to purification.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p48&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bambara language]], spoken mostly in Mali, it is known as ''bolokoli'' ("washing your hands"){{sfn|Zabus|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xZmWF3qxHo4C&amp;pg=PA47 47]}} and in the [[Igbo language]] in eastern Nigeria as ''isa aru'' or ''iwu aru'' ("having your bath").{{efn|For example, "a young woman must 'have her bath' before she has a baby".{{sfn|Zabus|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NCJiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40 40]}}}} A common [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term for purification has the root ''t-h-r'', used for male and female circumcision (''tahur'' and ''tahara'').{{sfn|El Guindi|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA30 30]}} It is also known in Arabic as ''khafḍ'' or ''khifaḍ''.{{sfn|Asmani|Abdi|2008|loc=3–5}} Communities may refer to FGM as "pharaonic" for [[infibulation]] and ''[[Sunnah|sunna]]'' circumcision for everything else.{{sfn|Gruenbaum|2001|loc=2–3}} ''Sunna'' means "path or way" in Arabic and refers to the tradition of [[Muhammad]], although none of the procedures are required within Islam.{{sfn|Asmani|Abdi|2008|loc=3–5}} The term ''infibulation'' derives from [[Fibula (brooch)|''fibula'']], Latin for clasp; the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] reportedly fastened clasps through the foreskins or labia of slaves to prevent sexual intercourse. The surgical infibulation of women came to be known as pharaonic circumcision in Sudan, and as Sudanese circumcision in Egypt.{{sfn|Kouba|Muasher|1985|loc=96–97}} In Somalia it is known simply as ''qodob'' ("to sew up").{{sfn|Abdalla|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA190 190]}}

==Methods==
[[File:Clitoris Anatomy.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|upright=0.9|Anatomy of the [[vulva]], showing the [[clitoral glans]], [[Crus of clitoris|clitoral crura]], [[Corpus cavernosum of clitoris|corpora cavernosa]], [[Bulb of vestibule|vestibular bulbs]], and [[vagina]]l and [[urethra]]l openings]]
The procedures are generally performed by a traditional circumciser (cutter or ''exciseuse'') in the girls' homes, with or without anaesthesia. The cutter is usually an older woman, but in communities where the male [[Barber#History|barber]] has assumed the role of health worker he will perform FGM too.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 42–44 and table 5, 181 (for cutters), 46 (for home and anaesthesia).&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|UNICEF 2005: "The large majority of girls and women are cut by a traditional practitioner, a category which includes local specialists (cutters or ''exciseuses''), traditional birth attendants and, generally, older members of the community, usually women. This is true for over 80 percent of the girls who undergo the practice in Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Tanzania and Yemen. In most countries, medical personnel, including doctors, nurses and certified midwives, are not widely involved in the practice."&lt;ref name=UNICEF2005&gt;[[#UNICEF2005|UNICEF 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;}} When traditional cutters are involved, non-sterile devices are likely to be used, including knives, razors, scissors, glass, sharpened rocks and fingernails.{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491}} According to a nurse in Uganda, quoted in 2007 in ''The Lancet'', a cutter would use one knife on up to 30 girls at a time.{{sfn|Wakabi|2007}} Health professionals are often involved in Egypt, Kenya, Indonesia and Sudan; in Egypt 77 percent of FGM procedures, and in Indonesia over 50 percent, were performed by medical professionals as of 2008 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNICEF2016/&gt; Women in Egypt reported in 1995 that a [[local anaesthetic]] had been used on their daughters in 60 percent of cases, a [[general anaesthetic]] in 13 percent, and neither in 25 percent (two percent were missing/don't know).&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification{{anchor|classification}}==
===Variation===
The WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA issued a joint statement in 1997 defining FGM as "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs whether for cultural or other non-therapeutic reasons".&lt;ref name=WHO2008pp4,22/&gt; The procedures vary considerably according to ethnicity and individual practitioners. During a 1998 survey in Niger, women responded with over 50 different terms when asked what was done to them.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p48/&gt; Translation problems are compounded by the women's confusion over which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=190}} Several studies have suggested that survey responses are unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent said they had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched in the other direction.{{sfn|Jackson|Akweongo|Sakeah|Hodgson|2003}} In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it.{{sfn|Klouman|Manongi|Klepp|2005}} In Sudan in 2006, a significant percentage of infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.{{sfn|Elmusharaf|Elhadi|Almroth|2006}}

===Types===
[[#Household surveys|Standard questionnaires]] from United Nations bodies ask women whether they or their daughters have undergone the following: (1) cut, no flesh removed (symbolic nicking); (2) cut, some flesh removed; (3) sewn closed; or (4) type not determined/unsure/doesn't know.{{efn|UNICEF 2013: "These categories do not fully match the WHO typology. ''Cut, no flesh removed'' describes a practice known as nicking or pricking, which currently is categorized as Type IV. ''Cut, some flesh removed'' corresponds to Type I (clitoridectomy) and Type II (excision) combined. And ''sewn closed'' corresponds to Type III, infibulation."&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p48/&gt;}} The most common procedures fall within the "cut, some flesh removed" category and involve complete or partial removal of the clitoral glans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=189}}; [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization (a UN agency) created a more detailed typology: Types I–III vary in how much tissue is removed; Type III is equivalent to the UNICEF category "sewn closed"; and Type IV describes miscellaneous procedures, including symbolic nicking.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 4, 23–28; {{harvnb|Abdulcadir|Catania|Hindin|Say|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FGC Types.svg|right|250px|alt=diagram]]
{{anchor|Type I}}'''Type I''' is "partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce". Type Ia{{efn|One WHO report refers to Type 1a as ''circumcision''.&lt;ref name=WHO2016types&gt;[[#WHO2016|WHO 2016]], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK368486/box/ch1.box1 Box 1.1 "Types of FGM"].&lt;/ref&gt;}} involves removal of the [[clitoral hood]] only. This is rarely performed alone.{{efn|WHO (2018): Type 1&amp;nbsp;... the partial or total removal of the clitoris&amp;nbsp;... and in very rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris)."&lt;ref name=WHO2018health/&gt;{{pb}}
WHO (2008): "[There is a] common tendency to describe Type I as removal of the prepuce, whereas this has not been documented as a traditional form of female genital mutilation. However, in some countries, medicalized female genital mutilation can include removal of the prepuce only (Type Ia) (Thabet and Thabet, 2003), but this form appears to be relatively rare (Satti et al., 2006). Almost all known forms of female genital mutilation that remove tissue from the clitoris also cut all or part of the clitoral glans itself."&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 25. Also see {{harvnb|Toubia|1994}} and {{harvnb|Horowitz|Jackson|Teklemariam|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The more common procedure is Type Ib ([[clitoridectomy]]), the complete or partial removal of the [[clitoral glans]] (the visible tip of the clitoris) and clitoral hood.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The circumciser pulls the clitoral glans with her thumb and index finger and cuts it off.{{efn|Susan Izett and [[Nahid Toubia]] (WHO, 1998): "[T]he clitoris is held between the thumb and index finger, pulled out and amputated with one stroke of a sharp object."&lt;ref name=WHO1998&gt;[[#WHO1998|WHO 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{anchor|Type II}}'''Type II''' (excision) is the complete or partial removal of the [[Labia minora|inner labia]], with or without removal of the clitoral glans and [[Labia majora|outer labia]]. Type IIa is removal of the inner labia; Type IIb, removal of the clitoral glans and inner labia; and Type IIc, removal of the clitoral glans, inner and outer labia. ''Excision'' in French can refer to any form of FGM.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;

{{anchor|Type III}}'''Type III''' ([[infibulation]] or pharaonic circumcision), the "sewn closed" category, involves the removal of the external genitalia and fusion of the wound. The inner and/or outer labia are cut away, with or without removal of the clitoral glans.{{efn|WHO 2014: "Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation).{{pb}}"Type IIIa, removal and apposition of the labia minora; Type IIIb, removal and apposition of the labia majora."&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;}} Type III is found largely in northeast Africa, particularly Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan (although not in South Sudan). According to one 2008 estimate, over eight million women in Africa are living with Type III FGM.{{efn|USAID 2008: "Infibulation is practiced largely in countries located in northeastern Africa: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan.&amp;nbsp;... Sudan alone accounts for about 3.5 million of the women.&amp;nbsp;... [T]he estimate of the total number of women infibulated in [Djibouti, Somalia, Eritrea, northern Sudan, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon and Tanzania, for women 15–49 years old] comes to 8,245,449, or just over eight million women."{{sfn|Yoder|Khan|2008|loc=13–14}}}} According to UNFPA in 2010, 20 percent of women with FGM have been infibulated.&lt;ref name=UNFPATypeIIIestimate&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/resources/promoting-gender-equality "Frequently Asked Questions on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting"], United Nations Population Fund, April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In Somalia "[t]he child is made to squat on a stool or mat facing the circumciser at a height that offers her a good view of the parts to be handled.&amp;nbsp;... adult helpers grab and pull apart the legs of the girl.&amp;nbsp;... If available, this is the stage at which a local anaesthetic would be used":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The element of speed and surprise is vital and the circumciser immediately grabs the clitoris by pinching it between her nails aiming to amputate it with a slash. The organ is then shown to the senior female relatives of the child who will decide whether the amount that has been removed is satisfactory or whether more is to be cut off.

After the clitoris has been satisfactorily amputated&amp;nbsp;... the circumciser can proceed with the total removal of the labia minora and the paring of the inner walls of the labia majora. Since the entire skin on the inner walls of the labia majora has to be removed all the way down to the perineum, this becomes a messy business. By now, the child is screaming, struggling, and bleeding profusely, which makes it difficult for the circumciser to hold with bare fingers and nails the slippery skin and parts that are to be cut or sutured together.&amp;nbsp;...

Having ensured that sufficient tissue has been removed to allow the desired fusion of the skin, the circumciser pulls together the opposite sides of the labia majora, ensuring that the raw edges where the skin has been removed are well approximated. The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a needle and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.&lt;ref name=Ismail2016p12&gt;{{harvnb|Ismail|2016|loc=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The amputated parts might be placed in a pouch for the girl to wear.{{sfn|El Guindi|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA43 43]}} A single hole of 2–3&amp;nbsp;mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid.{{efn|Jasmine Abdulcadir (''Swiss Medical Weekly'', 2011): "In the case of infibulation, the urethral opening and part of the vaginal opening are covered by the scar. In a virgin infibulated woman the small opening left for the menstrual fluid and the urine is not wider than 2–3&amp;nbsp;mm; in sexually active women and after the delivery the vaginal opening is wider but the urethral orifice is often still covered by the scar."{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}}} The vulva is closed with surgical thread, or [[agave]] or [[acacia]] thorns, and might be covered with a poultice of raw egg, herbs and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks.{{sfn|Ismail|2016|loc=14}}{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491}} If the remaining hole is too large in the view of the girl's family, the procedure is repeated.{{sfn|Abdalla|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA190 190]}}

The vagina is opened for sexual intercourse, for the first time either by a midwife with a knife or by the woman's husband with his penis.{{sfn|Abdalla|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA190 190–191], [https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA198 198]}} In some areas, including Somaliland, female relatives of the bride and groom might watch the opening of the vagina to check that the girl is a virgin.{{sfn|Ismail|2016|loc=14}} {{anchor|defibulation|deinfibulation|reinfibulation}} The woman is opened further for childbirth (''defibulation'' or ''deinfibulation''), and closed again afterwards (''reinfibulation''). Reinfibulation can involve cutting the vagina again to restore the pinhole size of the first infibulation. This might be performed before marriage, and after childbirth, divorce and widowhood.{{efn|Elizabeth Kelly, Paula J. Adams Hillard (''Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology'', 2005): "Women commonly undergo reinfibulation after a vaginal delivery. In addition to reinfibulation, many women in Sudan undergo a second type of re-suturing called El-Adel, which is performed to recreate the size of the vaginal orifice to be similar to the size created at the time of primary infibulation. Two small cuts are made around the vaginal orifice to expose new tissues to suture, and then sutures are placed to tighten the vaginal orifice and perineum. This procedure, also called re-circumcision, is primarily performed after vaginal delivery, but can also be performed before marriage, after cesarean section, after divorce, and sometimes even in elderly women as a preparation before death."{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491}}}}{{sfn|El Dareer|1982|loc=56–64}} Hanny Lightfoot-Klein interviewed hundreds of women and men in Sudan in the 1980s about sexual intercourse with Type III:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The penetration of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at all (in my study over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some who are unable to penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant in spite of the infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place.&amp;nbsp;... Those men who do manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, with the help of the "little knife". This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{{harvnb|Lightfoot-Klein|1989|loc=380}}; also see {{harvnb|El Dareer|1982|loc=42–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{anchor|Type IV}}'''Type IV''' is "[a]ll other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes", including pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; It includes nicking of the clitoris (symbolic circumcision), burning or scarring the genitals, and introducing substances into the vagina to tighten it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Labia stretching]] is also categorized as Type IV.&lt;ref name="WHO 2008, 27"&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Common in southern and eastern Africa, the practice is supposed to enhance sexual pleasure for the man and add to the sense of a woman as a closed space. From the age of eight, girls are encouraged to stretch their inner labia using sticks and massage. Girls in Uganda are told they may have difficulty giving birth without stretched labia.{{efn|WHO 2005: "In some areas (e.g. parts of Congo and mainland Tanzania), FGM entails the pulling of the labia minora and/or clitoris over a period of about 2 to 3 weeks. The procedure is initiated by an old woman designated for this task, who puts sticks of a special type in place to hold the stretched genital parts so that they do not revert back to their original size. The girl is instructed to pull her genitalia every day, to stretch them further, and to put additional sticks in to hold the stretched parts from time to time. This pulling procedure is repeated daily for a period of about two weeks, and usually no more than four sticks are used to hold the stretched parts, as further pulling and stretching would make the genital parts unacceptably long."&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2005|WHO 2005]], 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;For the countries in which labia stretching is found (Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe), see {{harvnb|Nzegwu|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&amp;pg=PA262 262]}}; for the rest, {{harvnb|Bagnol|Mariano|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&amp;pg=PA272 272–276] (272 for Uganda)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A definition of FGM from the WHO in 1995 included [[gishiri cutting]] and angurya cutting, found in Nigeria and Niger. These were removed from the WHO's 2008 definition because of insufficient information about prevalence and consequences.&lt;ref name="WHO 2008, 27"/&gt; Angurya cutting is excision of the [[hymen]], usually performed seven days after birth. Gishiri cutting involves cutting the vagina's front or back wall with a blade or penknife, performed in response to infertility, obstructed labour and other conditions. In a study by Nigerian physician Mairo Usman Mandara, over 30 percent of women with gishiri cuts were found to have [[vesicovaginal fistula]]e (holes that allow urine to seep into the vagina).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mandara|2000|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA98 98], 100; for fistulae, 102}}; also see {{harvnb|Mandara|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
===Short-term and late===
FGM harms women's physical and emotional health throughout their lives.{{sfn|Berg|Underland|Odgaard-Jensen|Fretheim|2014}}{{sfn|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=49}} It has no known health benefits.&lt;ref name=WHO2018health/&gt; The short-term and late [[complication (medicine)|complications]] depend on the type of FGM, whether the practitioner has had medical training, and whether they used antibiotics and sterilized or single-use surgical instruments. In the case of Type III, other factors include how small a hole was left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood, whether surgical thread was used instead of agave or acacia thorns, and whether the procedure was performed more than once (for example, to close an opening regarded as too wide or re-open one too small).{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}

[[File:Anti-FGM campaign, Walala Biyotey, 25 January 2014.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=photograph|FGM awareness session run by the [[African Union Mission to Somalia]] at the Walalah Biylooley refugee camp, [[Mogadishu]]]]
Common short-term complications include swelling, excessive bleeding, pain, [[Urinary retention|urine retention]], and healing problems/[[wound infection]]. A 2014 systematic review of 56 studies suggested that over one in ten girls and women undergoing any form of FGM, including symbolic nicking of the clitoris (Type IV), experience immediate complications, although the risks increased with Type III. The review also suggested that there was under-reporting.{{efn|Berg and Underland (Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services, 2014): "There was evidence of under-reporting of complications. However, the findings show that the FGM/C procedure unequivocally causes immediate, and typically several, health complications during the FGM/C procedure and the short-term period. Each of the most common complications occurred in more than one of every ten girls and women who undergo FGM/C. The participants in these studies had FGM/C types I through IV, thus immediate complications such as bleeding and swelling occur in setting with all forms of FGM/C. Even FGM/C type I and type IV 'nick', the forms of FGM/C with least anatomical extent, presented immediate complications. The results document that multiple immediate and quite serious complications can result from FGM/C. These results should be viewed in light of long-term complications, such as obstetric and gynecological problems, and protection of human rights."{{sfn|Berg|Underland|2014|loc=2}}}} Other short-term complications include fatal bleeding, [[anaemia]], [[urinary infection]], [[septicaemia]], [[tetanus]], [[gangrene]], [[necrotizing fasciitis]] (flesh-eating disease), and [[endometritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=49}}; {{harvnb|Iavazzo|Sardi|Gkegkes|2013}}; {{harvnb|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how many girls and women die as a result of the practice, because complications may not be recognized or reported. The practitioners' use of shared instruments is thought to aid the transmission of [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]] and [[HIV]], although no epidemiological studies have shown this.{{sfn|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=50}}

Late complications vary depending on the type of FGM.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} They include the formation of scars and [[keloid]]s that lead to [[Stenosis|strictures]] and obstruction, [[epidermoid cyst]]s that may become infected, and [[neuroma]] formation (growth of nerve tissue) involving nerves that supplied the clitoris.{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491–492}}{{sfn|Dave|Sethi|Morrone|2011}} An infibulated girl may be left with an opening as small as 2–3&amp;nbsp;mm, which can cause prolonged, drop-by-drop [[urination]], [[dysuria|pain while urinating]], and a feeling of needing to urinate all the time. Urine may collect underneath the scar, leaving the area under the skin constantly wet, which can lead to infection and the formation of small stones. The opening is larger in women who are sexually active or have given birth by vaginal delivery, but the [[urethra]] opening may still be obstructed by scar tissue. [[Vesicovaginal fistula|Vesicovaginal]] or [[rectovaginal fistula]]e can develop (holes that allow urine or faeces to seep into the vagina).{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}{{sfn|Rushwan|2013}} This and other damage to the urethra and bladder can lead to infections and incontinence, [[dyspareunia|pain during sexual intercourse]] and [[infertility]].{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491–492}} [[Dysmenorrhea|Painful periods]] are common because of the obstruction to the [[Menstruation|menstrual flow]], and blood can stagnate in the vagina and uterus. Complete obstruction of the vagina can result in [[hematocolpos]] and [[hematometra]] (where the vagina and uterus fill with menstrual blood).{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} The swelling of the abdomen that results from the collection of fluid, together with the lack of menstruation, can lead to suspicion of pregnancy; Asma El Dareer, a Sudanese physician, reported in 1979 that a girl in Sudan with this condition was killed by her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|El Dareer|1982|loc=37}}. Also see Asma El Dareer, "Preliminary report on a study on prevalence and epidemiology of female circumcision in Sudan today", WHO seminar, Khartoum, 10–15 February 1979; and Asma el Dareer, "Female circumcision and its consequences for mother and child", Yaounde, 12–15 December 1979, cited in {{harvnb|Rushwan|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pregnancy, childbirth===
[[File:Teaching_communities_about_FGM-C_(12345176104).jpg|thumb|Materials used to teach communities in [[Burkina Faso]] about FGM]]
FGM may place women at higher risk of problems during pregnancy and childbirth, which are more common with the more extensive FGM procedures.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} Infibulated women may try to make childbirth easier by eating less during pregnancy to reduce the baby's size.&lt;ref name=RashidRashid2007/&gt;{{rp|99}} In women with vesicovaginal or rectovaginal fistulae, it is difficult to obtain clear urine samples as part of prenatal care, making the diagnosis of conditions such as [[pre-eclampsia]] harder.{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491–492}} Cervical evaluation during labour may be impeded and labour prolonged or obstructed. Third-degree [[laceration]] (tears), [[Human anus|anal-sphincter]] damage and emergency [[caesarean section]] are more common in infibulated women.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}&lt;ref name=RashidRashid2007&gt;{{harvnb|Rashid|Rashid|2007|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Perinatal mortality#Neonatal mortality|Neonatal mortality]] is increased. The WHO estimated in 2006 that an additional 10–20 babies die per 1,000 deliveries as a result of FGM. The estimate was based on a study conducted on 28,393 women attending delivery wards at 28 obstetric centres in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan. In those settings all types of FGM were found to pose an increased risk of death to the baby: 15 percent higher for Type I, 32 percent for Type II, and 55 percent for Type III. The reasons for this were unclear, but may be connected to genital and [[urinary tract infection]]s and the presence of scar tissue. According to the study, FGM was associated with an increased risk to the mother of damage to the [[perineum]] and [[postpartum bleeding|excessive blood loss]], as well as a need to [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|resuscitate]] the baby, and [[stillbirth]], perhaps because of a long [[Childbirth#Second stage: fetal expulsion|second stage of labour]].{{sfn|Banks|Meirik|Farley|Akande|2006}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr30/en/index.html "New study shows female genital mutilation exposes women and babies to significant risk at childbirth"], World Health Organization, 2 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological effects, sexual function===
According to a 2015 [[systematic review]] there is little high-quality information available on the psychological effects of FGM. Several small studies have concluded that women with FGM suffer from anxiety, depression and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].{{sfn|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=50}} Feelings of shame and betrayal can develop when women leave the culture that practises FGM and learn that their condition is not the norm, but within the practising culture they may view their FGM with pride, because for them it signifies beauty, respect for tradition, chastity and hygiene.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} Studies on sexual function have also been small.{{sfn|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=50}} A 2013 [[meta-analysis]] of 15 studies involving 12,671 women from seven countries concluded that women with FGM were twice as likely to report no sexual desire and 52 percent more likely to report [[dyspareunia]] (painful sexual intercourse). One third reported reduced sexual feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berg|Denison|2013}}; {{harvnb|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=51}}; {{harvnb|Sibiani|Rouzi|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
===Household surveys===
[[File:Composite FGM world map.svg|thumb|A composite data map showing the % of women and girls aged 15-49 years (unless otherwise stated) who have undergone FGM/C. Source: UNICEF (2016) and a number of additional studies for countries outside Africa not surveyed by UNICEF. Grey countries' data are not covered.]]

Aid agencies define the prevalence of FGM as the percentage of the 15–49 age group that has experienced it.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=193}} These figures are based on nationally representative household surveys known as [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] (DHS), developed by [[ICF International|Macro International]] and funded mainly by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID); and [[Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys]] (MICS) conducted with financial and technical help from UNICEF.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=190}} These surveys have been carried out in Africa, Asia, Latin America and elsewhere roughly every five years, since 1984 and 1995 respectively.&lt;ref name=DHS&gt;[http://www.dhsprogram.com/What-We-Do/Survey-Types/DHS.cfm "DHS overview"], Demographic and Health Surveys; [http://www.childinfo.org/mics5_questionnaire.html "Questionnaires and Indicator List"], Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt; The first to ask about FGM was the 1989–1990 DHS in northern Sudan. The first publication to estimate FGM prevalence based on DHS data (in seven countries) was written by Dara Carr of Macro International in 1997.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013}}

===Type of FGM===
Questions the women are asked during the surveys include: "Was the genital area just nicked/cut without removing any flesh? Was any flesh (or something) removed from the genital area? Was your genital area sewn?"&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Most women report "cut, some flesh removed" (Types I and II).&lt;ref name=Yoder2013p189TypeI&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 47, table 5.2; {{harvnb|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Type I is the most common form in Egypt,{{sfn|Rasheed|Abd-Ellah|Yousef|2011}} and in the southern parts of Nigeria.{{sfn|Okeke|Anyaehie|Ezenyeaku|2012|loc=70–73}} Type III (infibulation) is concentrated in northeastern Africa, particularly Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan.{{sfn|Yoder|Khan|2008|loc=13–14}} In surveys in 2002–2006, 30 percent of cut girls in Djibouti, 38 percent in Eritrea, and 63 percent in Somalia had experienced Type III.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 47. For the years and country profiles: [[#UNICEFDjibouti|Djibouti]], UNICEF, December 2013; [[#UNICEFEritrea|Eritrea]], UNICEF, July 2013; [[#UNICEFSomalia|Somalia]], UNICEF, December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a high prevalence of infibulation among girls in Niger and Senegal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 114.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 it was estimated that in Nigeria three percent of the 0–14 age group had been infibulated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEFNigeria|Nigeria]], UNICEF, July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of procedure is often linked to ethnicity. In Eritrea, for example, a survey in 2002 found that all [[Hedareb people|Hedareb]] girls had been infibulated, compared with two percent of the [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrinya]], most of whom fell into the "cut, no flesh removed" category.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p48/&gt;

FGM is mostly found in what [[Gerry Mackie]] called an "intriguingly contiguous" zone in Africa—east to west from Somalia to Senegal, and north to south from Egypt to Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MackieLeJeune2008|Mackie and LeJeune (UNICEF) 2008]], 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationally representative figures are available for 27 countries in Africa, as well as Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen.

Prevalence figures for the 15–19 age group and younger show a downward trend.{{efn|UNICEF 2013: "The percentage of girls and women of reproductive age (15 to 49) who have experienced any form of FGM/C is the first indicator used to show how widespread the practice is in a particular country&amp;nbsp;... A second indicator of national prevalence measures the extent of cutting among daughters aged 0 to 14, as reported by their mothers. Prevalence data for girls reflect their current&amp;nbsp;– not final&amp;nbsp;– FGM/C status, since many of them may not have reached the customary age for cutting at the time of the survey.

{{pb}} An additional complication in judging prevalence among girls is that, in countries running campaigns against FGM, women might not report that their daughters have been cut.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 25, 100; {{harvnb|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} For example, Burkina Faso fell from 89 percent (1980) to 58 percent (2010); Egypt from 97 percent (1985) to 70 percent (2015); and Kenya from 41 percent (1984) to 11 percent (2014).&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2016|UNICEF 2016]], 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2010, household surveys asked women about the FGM status of all their living daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=194}}; [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest concentrations among girls aged 0–14 were in Gambia (56 percent), Mauritania (54 percent), Indonesia (49 percent for 0–11) and Guinea (46 percent).&lt;ref name=UNICEF2016/&gt; The figures suggest that a girl was one third less likely in 2014 to undergo FGM than she was 30 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2014|UNICEF 2014]], 2.&lt;/ref&gt; If the rate of decline continues, the number of girls cut will nevertheless rise, because of population growth, from 3.6 million a year in 2013 to 4.1 million in 2050.{{efn|UNICEF 2014: "If there is no reduction in the practice between now and 2050, the number of girls cut each year will grow from 3.6 million in 2013 to 6.6 million in 2050.

According to a 2018 study published in the British Medical Journal there has been a large decline in number of FGM cases among the 0-14 year old in Africa in the 1990-2017 period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/07/fgm-rates-in-east-africa-drop-20-years-study-shows FGM rates in east Africa drop from 71% to 8% in 20 years, study shows] The Guardian, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gh.bmj.com/content/3/5/e000549 Secular trends in the prevalence of female genital mutilation/cutting among girls: a systematic analysis] British Medical Journal, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural areas, wealth, education===
Surveys have found FGM to be more common in rural areas, less common in most countries among girls from the wealthiest homes, and (except in Sudan and Somalia) less common in girls whose mothers had access to primary or secondary/higher education. In Somalia and Sudan the situation was reversed: in Somalia the mothers' access to secondary/higher education was accompanied by a rise in prevalence of FGM in their daughters, and in Sudan access to any education was accompanied by a rise.&lt;ref&gt;For rural areas, [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 28; for wealth, 40; for education, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age, ethnicity===
FGM is not invariably a [[rite of passage]] between childhood and adulthood, but is often performed on much younger children.{{sfn|Mackie|2000|loc=275}} Girls are most commonly cut shortly after birth to age 15. In half the countries for which national figures were available in 2000–2010, most girls had been cut by age five.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p50&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 80 percent (of those cut) are cut before the age of five in Nigeria, Mali, Eritrea, Ghana and Mauritania.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013pp47,183&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 47, 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 Demographic and Health Survey in Yemen found that 76 percent of girls had been cut within two weeks of birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/fgm_eng.pdf UNICEF 2005], 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage is reversed in Somalia, Egypt, Chad and the Central African Republic, where over 80 percent (of those cut) are cut between five and 14.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013pp47,183/&gt; Just as the type of FGM is often linked to ethnicity, so is the mean age. In Kenya, for example, the [[Kisi people|Kisi]] cut around age 10 and the [[Kamba people|Kamba]] at 16.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

A country's national prevalence often reflects a high sub-national prevalence among certain ethnicities, rather than a widespread practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 28–37.&lt;/ref&gt; In Iraq, for example, FGM is found mostly among the [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] in [[Erbil]] (58 percent prevalence within age group 15–49, as of 2011), [[Sulaymaniyah]] (54 percent) and [[Kirkuk]] (20 percent), giving the country a national prevalence of eight percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013]. For eight percent in Iraq, 27, box&amp;nbsp;4.4, group&amp;nbsp;5; for the regions in Iraq, 31, map&amp;nbsp;4.6). Also see {{harvnb|Yasin|Al-Tawil|Shabila|Al-Hadithi|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is sometimes an ethnic marker, but it may differ along national lines. For example, in the northeastern regions of Ethiopia and Kenya, which share a border with Somalia, the [[Somali people]] practise FGM at around the same rate as they do in Somalia.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=196, 198}} But in Guinea all [[Fula people|Fulani]] women responding to a survey in 2012 said they had experienced FGM,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141220043131/http://data.unicef.org/corecode/uploads/document6/uploaded_country_profiles/corecode/30/Countries/FGMC_GIN.pdf "Guinea"] (2012), UNICEF statistical profile, July 2014, 2/4.&lt;/ref&gt; against 12 percent of the Fulani in Chad, while in Nigeria the Fulani are the only large ethnic group in the country not to practise it.&lt;ref&gt;Chad: [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 35–36; Nigeria: {{harvnb|Okeke|Anyaehie|Ezenyeaku|2012|loc=70–73}}. FGM is practised in Nigeria by the Yoruba, Hausa, Ibo, Ijaw and Kanuri people.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahabo Musa, a Somali woman, described infibulation in a 1988 poem as the "three feminine sorrows": the procedure itself, the wedding night when the woman is cut open, then childbirth when she is cut again.{{sfn|Abdalla|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA187 187]}} Despite the evident suffering, it is women who organize all forms of FGM.{{sfn|Khazan|2015}}{{sfn|Shell-Duncan|2008}} Anthropologist Rose Oldfield Hayes wrote in 1975 that educated Sudanese men who did not want their daughters to be infibulated (preferring clitoridectomy) would find the girls had been sewn up after the grandmothers arranged a visit to relatives.{{sfn|Hayes|1975|loc=620, 624}} [[Gerry Mackie]] has compared the practice to [[footbinding]]. Like FGM, footbinding was carried out on young girls, nearly universal where practised, tied to ideas about honour, chastity and appropriate marriage, and "supported and transmitted" by women.{{efn|[[Gerry Mackie]], 1996: "Footbinding and infibulation correspond as follows. Both customs are nearly universal where practised; they are persistent and are practised even by those who oppose them. Both control sexual access to females and ensure female chastity and fidelity. Both are necessary for proper marriage and family honor. Both are believed to be sanctioned by tradition. Both are said to be ethnic markers, and distinct ethnic minorities may lack the practices. Both seem to have a past of contagious diffusion. Both are exaggerated over time and both increase with status. Both are supported and transmitted by women, are performed on girls about six to eight years old, and are generally not initiation rites. Both are believed to promote health and fertility. Both are defined as aesthetically pleasing compared with the natural alternative. Both are said to properly exaggerate the complementarity of the sexes, and both are claimed to make intercourse more pleasurable for the male."{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=999–1000}}}}

[[File:Fuambai Sia Ahmadu (1).jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|[[Fuambai Ahmadu]] chose to undergo clitoridectomy as an adult.&lt;ref name=Ahmadu2000/&gt;]]
FGM practitioners see the procedures as marking not only ethnic boundaries but also gender difference. According to this view, male circumcision defeminizes men while FGM demasculinizes women.&lt;ref&gt;Rogaia Mustafa Abusharaf, "Introduction: The Custom in Question", in Abusharaf 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA8 8].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|El Guindi|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA36 36–37]}} [[Fuambai Ahmadu]], an anthropologist and member of the [[Kono people]] of Sierra Leone, who in 1992 underwent clitoridectomy as an adult during a [[Sande society]] initiation, argued in 2000 that it is a male-centred assumption that the clitoris is important to female sexuality. African female symbolism revolves instead around the concept of the womb.&lt;ref name=Ahmadu2000&gt;[[Fuambai Ahmadu]], "Rites and Wrongs: An Insider/Outsider Reflects on Power and Excision," in Shell-Duncan and Hernlund 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA284 284–285].&lt;/ref&gt; Infibulation draws on that idea of enclosure and fertility. "[G]enital cutting completes the social definition of a child's sex by eliminating external traces of androgyny," [[Janice Boddy]] wrote in 2007. "The female body is then covered, closed, and its productive blood bound within; the male body is unveiled, opened and exposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boddy|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&amp;pg=PA112 112]}}; also see {{harvnb|Boddy|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TK6NIp5uVwsC&amp;pg=PA52 52–61]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In communities where infibulation is common, there is a preference for women's genitals to be smooth, dry and without odour, and both women and men may find the natural vulva repulsive.{{sfn|Gruenbaum|2005|loc=435–436}} Some men seem to enjoy the effort of penetrating an infibulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gruenbaum|2005|loc=437}}; {{harvnb|Gruenbaum|2001|loc=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The local preference for [[dry sex]] causes women to introduce substances into the vagina to reduce lubrication, including leaves, tree bark, toothpaste and [[Vicks VapoRub|Vicks menthol rub]].&lt;ref&gt;Bagnol and Mariano 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&amp;pg=PA277 277–281].&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO includes this practice within Type IV FGM, because the added friction during intercourse can cause lacerations and increase the risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the smooth appearance of an infibulated vulva, there is also a belief that infibulation increases hygiene.{{sfn|Gruenbaum|2005|loc=437}}

Common reasons for FGM cited by women in surveys are social acceptance, religion, hygiene, preservation of virginity, marriageability and enhancement of male sexual pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study in northern Sudan, published in 1983, only 17.4 percent of women opposed FGM (558 out of 3,210), and most preferred excision and infibulation over clitoridectomy.{{sfn|El Dareer|1983|loc=140}} Attitudes are changing slowly. In Sudan in 2010, 42 percent of women who had heard of FGM said the practice should continue.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 178.&lt;/ref&gt; In several surveys since 2006, over 50 percent of women in Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gambia and Egypt supported FGM's continuance, while elsewhere in Africa, Iraq and Yemen most said it should end, although in several countries only by a narrow margin.{{efn|"The highest levels of support can be found in Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gambia and Egypt, where more than half the female population think the practice should continue."&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 52. Also see figure 6.1, 54, and figures 8.1A&amp;nbsp;– 8.1D, 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Social obligation, poor access to information===
[[File:Keur Simbara, Senegal (8592417042), cropped.jpg|thumb|upright-1.2|alt=photograph|Keur Simbara, Senegal, abandoned FGM in 1998 after a three-year program by [[Tostan]].&lt;ref&gt;Malick Gueye, [http://www.tostan.org/blog/social-norm-change-theorists-meet-again-keur-simbara-senegal "Social Norm Change Theorists meet again in Keur Simbara, Senegal"], Tostan, 4 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Against the argument that women willingly choose FGM for their daughters, UNICEF calls the practice a "self-enforcing social convention" to which families feel they must conform to avoid uncut daughters facing social exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellen Gruenbaum]] reported that, in Sudan in the 1970s, cut girls from an Arab ethnic group would mock uncut [[Zarma people|Zabarma]] girls with ''Ya, Ghalfa!'' ("Hey, unclean!"). The Zabarma girls would respond ''Ya, mutmura!'' (A ''mutmara'' was a storage pit for grain that was continually opened and closed, like an infibulated woman.) But despite throwing the insult back, the Zabarma girls would ask their mothers, "What's the matter? Don't we have razor blades like the Arabs?"{{sfn|Gruenbaum|2005|loc=432–433}}

Because of poor access to information, and because circumcisers downplay the causal connection, women may not associate the health consequences with the procedure. Lala Baldé, president of a women's association in Medina Cherif, a village in Senegal, told Mackie in 1998 that when girls fell ill or died, it was attributed to evil spirits. When informed of the causal relationship between FGM and ill health, Mackie wrote, the women broke down and wept. He argued that surveys taken before and after this sharing of information would show very different levels of support for FGM.{{sfn|Mackie|2003|loc=147–148}} The American non-profit group [[Tostan]], founded by [[Molly Melching]] in 1991, introduced community-empowerment programs in several countries that focus on local democracy, literacy, and education about healthcare, giving women the tools to make their own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diop2008|Diop et al. (UNICEF) 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, using the Tostan program, [[Malicounda Bambara]] in Senegal became the first village to abandon FGM.{{sfn|Mackie|2000|loc=256ff}} By 2018 over 8,000 communities in eight countries had pledged to abandon FGM and [[child marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tostan.org/female-genital-cutting "Female Genital Cutting"], Tostan, accessed 6 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{further|Religious views on female genital mutilation}}
Surveys have shown a widespread belief, particularly in Mali, Mauritania, Guinea and Egypt, that FGM is a religious requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 69–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Gruenbaum has argued that practitioners may not distinguish between religion, tradition and chastity, making it difficult to interpret the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gruenbaum|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JOXmOLBd4E4C&amp;pg=PA50 50]}}; [[#MackieLeJeune2008|Mackie and LeJeune (UNICEF) 2008]], 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; FGM's origins in northeastern Africa are pre-Islamic, but the practice became associated with Islam because of that religion's focus on female chastity and seclusion.{{efn|[[Gerry Mackie]], 1996: "FGM is pre-Islamic but was exaggerated by its intersection with the Islamic modesty code of family honor, female purity, virginity, chastity, fidelity, and seclusion."{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=1008}}}} There is no mention of it in the [[Quran]].{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=1004–1005}} It is praised in a few [[Hadith terminology|''daʻīf'']] (weak) ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings attributed to Muhammad) as noble but not required,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roald|2003|loc=224}}; {{harvnb|Asmani|Abdi|2008|loc=6–13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Gerry Mackie]], 1996: "The Koran is silent on FGM, but several ''hadith'' (sayings attributed to Mohammed) recommend attenuating the practice for the woman's sake, praise it as noble but not commanded, or advise that female converts refrain from mutilation because even if pleasing to the husband it is painful to the wife."{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=1004–1005}}}} although it is regarded as obligatory by the [[Shafi'i]] version of [[Sunni Islam]].{{sfn|Roald|2003|loc=243}} In 2007 the [[Al-Azhar University#Council of Senior Scholars|Al-Azhar Supreme Council of Islamic Research]] in Cairo ruled that FGM had "no basis in core Islamic law or any of its partial provisions".&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEFpress2July2007|UNICEF press release]], 2 July 2007; [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 70.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Maggie Michael, Associated Press, 2007: "[Egypt's] supreme religious authorities stressed that Islam is against female circumcision.

There is no mention of FGM in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Waje Kunhiyop, ''African Christian Ethics'', Zondervan, 2008, 297: "Nowhere in all of Scripture or in any of recorded church history is there even a hint that women were to be circumcised."&lt;/ref&gt; Christian missionaries in Africa were [[#Colonial opposition in Kenya|among the first]] to object to FGM,{{sfn|Murray|1976}} but Christian communities in Africa do practise it. A 2013 UNICEF report identified 17 African countries in which at least 10 percent of Christian women and girls aged 15 to 49 had undergone FGM; in Niger 55 percent of Christian women and girls had experienced it, compared with two percent of their Muslim counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], front page and 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The only Jewish group known to have practised it are the [[Beta Israel]] of Ethiopia.

The practice's origins are unknown.

The examination of [[Mummy|mummies]] has shown no evidence of FGM. Citing the Australian pathologist [[Grafton Elliot Smith]], who examined hundreds of mummies in the early 20th century, Knight writes that the genital area may resemble Type III because during mummification the skin of the outer labia was pulled toward the anus to cover the [[pudendal cleft]], possibly to prevent sexual violation. It was similarly not possible to determine whether Types I or II had been performed, because soft tissues had deteriorated or been removed by the embalmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|2001|loc=331}}, citing G. Elliot Smith, ''A Contribution to the Study of Mummification in Egypt'', Cairo: L'Institut Egyptien, 1906, 30, and [[Marc Armand Ruffer]], ''Studies in the Paleopathology of Egypt'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1921, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek geographer [[Strabo]] (c. 64 BCE&amp;nbsp;– c. 23 CE) wrote about FGM after visiting Egypt around 25 BCE: "This is one of the customs most zealously pursued by them [the Egyptians]: to raise every child that is born and to circumcise [''peritemnein''] the males and excise [''ektemnein''] the females&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;25&amp;nbsp;BCE, cited in {{harvnb|Knight|2001|loc=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;25&amp;nbsp;BCE: "One of the customs most zealously observed among the Aegyptians is this, that they rear every child that is born, and circumcise [περιτέμνειν, ''peritemnein''] the males, and excise [''ektemnein''] the females, as is also customary among the Jews, who are also Aegyptians in origin, as I have already stated in my account of them."&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17B*.html#ref273 Book VII, chapter 2], 17.2.5.

Xanthus wrote, in a history of [[Lydia]]: "The Lydians arrived at such a state of delicacy that they were even the first to 'castrate' their women." Knight argues that the "castration", which is not described, may have kept women youthful, in the sense of allowing the Lydian king to have intercourse with them without pregnancy. Knight concludes that it may have been a reference to sterilization, not FGM.{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=326}}}} [[Philo|Philo of Alexandria]] (c. 20 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 50 CE) also made reference to it: "the Egyptians by the custom of their country circumcise the marriageable youth and maid in the fourteenth (year) of their age, when the male begins to get seed, and the female to have a menstrual flow."{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=333}} It is mentioned briefly in a work attributed to the Greek physician [[Galen]] (129&amp;nbsp;– c.&amp;nbsp;200 CE): "When [the clitoris] sticks out to a great extent in their young women, Egyptians consider it appropriate to cut it out."{{efn|Knight adds that the attribution to Galen is suspect.{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=336}}}} Another Greek physician, [[Aëtius of Amida]] (mid-5th to mid-6th century CE), offered more detail in book 16 of his ''Sixteen Books on Medicine'', citing the physician Philomenes. The procedure was performed in case the clitoris, or ''nymphê'', grew too large or triggered sexual desire when rubbing against clothing. "On this account, it seemed proper to the Egyptians to remove it before it became greatly enlarged," Aëtius wrote, "especially at that time when the girls were about to be married":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The surgery is performed in this way: Have the girl sit on a chair while a muscled young man standing behind her places his arms below the girl's thighs. Have him separate and steady her legs and whole body. Standing in front and taking hold of the clitoris with a broad-mouthed forceps in his left hand, the surgeon stretches it outward, while with the right hand, he cuts it off at the point next to the pincers of the forceps.

It is proper to let a length remain from that cut off, about the size of the membrane that's between the nostrils, so as to take away the excess material only; as I have said, the part to be removed is at that point just above the pincers of the forceps. Because the clitoris is a skinlike structure and stretches out excessively, do not cut off too much, as a urinary fistula may result from cutting such large growths too deeply.{{efn|A paragraph break has been added for ease of reading.}}{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=327–328}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The genital area was then cleaned with a sponge, [[frankincense]] powder and wine or cold water, and wrapped in linen bandages dipped in vinegar, until the seventh day when [[calamine]], rose petals, date pits or a "genital powder made from baked clay" might be applied.{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=328}}

Whatever the practice's origins, infibulation became linked to slavery. Mackie cites the Portuguese missionary [[João dos Santos]], who in 1609 wrote of a group near Mogadishu who had a "custome to sew up their Females, especially their slaves being young to make them unable for conception, which makes these slaves sell dearer, both for their chastitie, and for better confidence which their Masters put in them". Thus, Mackie argues, a "practice associated with shameful female slavery came to stand for honor".{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=1003, 1009}}

Protestant missionaries in [[East Africa Protectorate|British East Africa]] (present-day Kenya) began campaigning against FGM in the early 20th century, when Dr. [[John Arthur]] joined the [[Church of Scotland]] Mission (CSM) in Kikuyu. An important ethnic marker, the practice was known by the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], the country's main ethnic group, as ''irua'' for both girls and boys. It involved excision (Type II) for girls and removal of the foreskin for boys. Unexcised Kikuyu women (''irugu'') were outcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn M. Thomas,{{" '}}Ngaitana (I will circumcise myself)': Lessons from Colonial Campaigns to Ban Excision in Meru, Kenya" in Shell-Duncan and Hernlund, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA132 132].{{pb}}

[[Jomo Kenyatta]], general secretary of the [[Kikuyu Central Association]] and later Kenya's first prime minister, wrote in 1938 that, for the Kikuyu, the institution of FGM was the "''[[Sine qua non|conditio sine qua non]]'' of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion and morality". No proper Kikuyu man or woman would marry or have sexual relations with someone who was not circumcised. A woman's responsibilities toward the tribe began with her initiation. Her age and place within tribal history was traced to that day, and the group of girls with whom she was cut was named according to current events, an [[oral tradition]] that allowed the Kikuyu to track people and events going back hundreds of years.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyatta 1962 [1938], 127–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the CSM mission in 1925, several missionary churches declared that FGM was prohibited for African Christians. The CSM announced that Africans practising it would be excommunicated, which resulted in hundreds leaving or being expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Fiedler, ''Christianity and African Culture'', Leiden: Brill, 1996, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The stand-off turned FGM into a focal point of the Kenyan independence movement; the 1929–1931 period is known in the country's historiography as the female circumcision controversy.{{sfn|Boddy|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&amp;pg=PA241 241–245]}}&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hyam, ''Empire and Sexuality: The British Experience'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1990; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1594780 Murray 1976], 92–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 the Kenya Missionary Council began referring to FGM as the "sexual mutilation of women", rather than circumcision, and a person's stance toward the practice became a test of loyalty, either to the Christian churches or to the Kikuyu Central Association.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2000, 132; for the "sexual mutilation of women", Karanja 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F1ezIgyomGIC&amp;pg=PA93 93], n.&amp;nbsp;631.{{pb}}

In 1956 the council of male elders (the ''Njuri Nchecke'') in Meru announced a ban on FGM. Over the next three years, thousands of girls cut each other's genitals with razor blades as a symbol of defiance. The movement came to be known as ''Ngaitana'' ("I will circumcise myself"), because to avoid naming their friends the girls said they had cut themselves. Historian Lynn Thomas described the episode as significant in the history of FGM because it made clear that its victims were also its perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA129 129–131] (131 for the girls as "central actors"); Lynn Thomas, ''Politics of the Womb: Women, Reproduction, and the State in Kenya'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003, 89–91.{{pb}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;I did not know what they had cut off from my body, and I did not try to find out. I just wept, and called out to my mother for help. But the worst shock of all was when I looked around and found her standing by my side.

In 1975, Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American social scientist, became the first female academic to publish a detailed account of FGM, aided by her ability to discuss it directly with women in Sudan. Her article in ''American Ethnologist'' called it "female genital mutilation", rather than female circumcision, and brought it to wider academic attention.{{sfn|Hayes|1975|loc=21}} [[Edna Adan Ismail]], who worked at the time for the Somalia Ministry of Health, discussed the health consequences of FGM in 1977 with the [[Somali Women's Democratic Organization]].{{sfn|Abdalla|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA201 201]}}&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Topping, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/23/somaliland-womens-rights-gender-violence "Somaliland's leading lady for women's rights: 'It is time for men to step up'"], ''The Guardian'', 23 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later [[Fran Hosken]], an Austria-American feminist, published ''The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females'' (1979),{{sfn|Hosken|1994}} the first to offer global figures. She estimated that 110,529,000 women in 20 African countries had experienced FGM.{{sfn|Yoder|Khan|2008|loc=2}} The figures were speculative but consistent with later surveys.{{sfn|Mackie|2003|loc=139}} Describing FGM as a "training ground for male violence", Hosken accused female practitioners of "participating in the destruction of their own kind".{{sfn|Hosken|1994|loc=5}} The language caused a rift between Western and African feminists; African women boycotted a session featuring Hosken during the UN's Mid-Decade Conference on Women in Copenhagen in July 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle 2002, 47; Bagnol and Mariano 2011, 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the WHO held a seminar, "Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children", in Khartoum, Sudan, and in 1981, also in Khartoum, 150 academics and activists signed a pledge to fight FGM after a workshop held by the [[Babikir Badri|Babiker Badri Scientific Association for Women's Studies]] (BBSAWS), "Female Circumcision Mutilates and Endangers Women&amp;nbsp;– Combat it!" Another BBSAWS workshop in 1984 invited the international community to write a joint statement for the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Shahira Ahmed, "Babiker Badri Scientific Association for Women's Studies", in Abusharaf 2007, 176–180.&lt;/ref&gt; It recommended that the "goal of all African women" should be the eradication of FGM and that, to sever the link between FGM and religion, clitoridectomy should no longer be referred to as ''sunna''.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed 2007, 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children, founded in 1984 in Dakar, Senegal, called for an end to the practice, as did the UN's [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna in 1993.

==Criticism of opposition==
===Tolerance versus human rights===
[[File:Obioma Nnaemeka (cropped 2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=photograph|Academic [[Obioma Nnaemeka]] criticized the renaming of female circumcision to female genital mutilation.{{sfn|Nnaemeka|2005|loc=[https://webrecorder.io/Germinal/wikipedia/20180527025854/https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA34 34]}}]]
Anthropologists have accused FGM eradicationists of [[cultural imperialism|cultural colonialism]], and have been criticized in turn for their [[moral relativism]] and failure to defend the idea of universal [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Silverman|Eric K. Silverman]], "Anthropology and Circumcision," ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', 33, 2004 (419–445), 420, 427. {{jstor|25064860}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to critics of the eradicationist position, the [[Reductionism#In science|biological reductionism]] of the opposition to FGM, and the failure to appreciate FGM's cultural context, serves to "[[Othering|other]]" practitioners and undermine their agency—in particular when parents are referred to as "mutilators".{{sfn|Kirby|2005|loc=83}}

Africans who object to the tone of FGM opposition risk appearing to defend the practice. The feminist theorist [[Obioma Nnaemeka]], herself strongly opposed to FGM, argued in 2005 that renaming the practice ''female genital mutilation'' had introduced "a subtext of barbaric African and Muslim cultures and the West's relevance (even indispensability) in purging [it]".{{sfn|Nnaemeka|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA33 33]}} According to Ugandan law professor [[Sylvia Tamale]], the early Western opposition to FGM stemmed from a Judeo-Christian judgment that African sexual and family practices, including not only FGM but also [[dry sex]], [[polygyny]], [[bride price]] and [[levirate marriage]], required correction. African feminists "take strong exception to the imperialist, racist and dehumanising infantilization of African women", she wrote in 2011.{{sfn|Tamale|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&amp;pg=PA19 19–20]}} Commentators highlight the voyeurism in the treatment of women's bodies as exhibits. Examples include images of women's vaginas after FGM or girls undergoing the procedure.{{sfn|Nnaemeka|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA30 30–33]}} The 1996 [[#Pulitzer|Pulitzer-prize-winning photographs]] of a 16-year-old Kenyan girl experiencing FGM were published by 12 American newspapers, without her consent either to be photographed or to have the images published.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Korieh|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA121 121–122]}}; for the photographs, see {{cite web |title=Stephanie Walsh.

The debate has highlighted a tension between anthropology and feminism, with the former's focus on tolerance and the latter's on equal rights for women. According to the anthropologist Christine Walley, a common position within anti-FGM literature has been to present African women as victims of [[false consciousness]] participating in their own oppression, a position promoted by feminists in the 1970s and 1980s, including Fran Hosken, [[Mary Daly]] and Hanny Lightfoot-Klein.{{sfn|Walley|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=t_5a39rTNB8C&amp;pg=PA18 18], 34, 43, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t_5a39rTNB8C&amp;pg=PA60 60]}} It prompted the French Association of Anthropologists to issue a statement in 1981, at the height of the early debates, that "a certain feminism resuscitates (today) the moralistic arrogance of yesterday's colonialism".&lt;ref name="Bagnol and Mariano 2011, 281"/&gt;

===Comparison with other procedures{{anchor|comparison}}===
====Cosmetic procedures====
{{See also|Labiaplasty#Criticism}}
Nnaemeka argues that the crucial question, broader than FGM, is why the female body is subjected to so much "abuse and indignity", including in the West.{{sfn|Nnaemeka|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA38 38–39]}} Several authors have drawn a parallel between FGM and cosmetic procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnsdotter|Essén|2010|loc=32}}; {{harvnb|Berer|2007|loc=1335}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ronán Conroy of the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] wrote in 2006 that cosmetic genital procedures were "driving the advance" of FGM by encouraging women to see natural variations as defects.{{sfn|Conroy|2006}} Anthropologist [[Fadwa El Guindi]] compared FGM to [[Breast augmentation|breast enhancement]], in which the maternal function of the breast becomes secondary to men's sexual pleasure.{{sfn|El Guindi|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA33 33]}} [[Benoîte Groult]], the French feminist, made a similar point in 1975, citing FGM and cosmetic surgery as sexist and patriarchal.{{sfn|Wildenthal|2012|loc=148}} Against this, the medical anthropologist [[Carla Obermeyer]] argued in 1999 that FGM may be conducive to a subject's social well-being in the same way that [[rhinoplasty]] and male circumcision are.&lt;ref&gt;Obermeyer 1999, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the 2007 ban in Egypt, Egyptian women wanting FGM for their daughters seek ''amalyet tajmeel'' (cosmetic surgery) to remove what they see as excess genital tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Abdel Rahim, [http://timep.org/commentary/midwives-doctors-searching-safer-circumcisions-egypt# "From Midwives to Doctors: Searching for “Safer” Circumcisions in Egypt?"], The Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, 25 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmetic procedures such as [[labiaplasty]] and [[clitoral hood reduction]] do fall within the WHO's definition of FGM, which aims to avoid loopholes, but the WHO notes that these elective practices are generally not regarded as FGM.{{efn|WHO 2008: "Some practices, such as genital cosmetic surgery and hymen repair, which are legally accepted in many countries and not generally considered to constitute female genital mutilation, actually fall under the definition used here. It has been considered important, however, to maintain a broad definition of female genital mutilation in order to avoid loopholes that might allow the practice to continue."&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Some legislation banning FGM, such as in Canada and the US, covers minors only, but several countries, including Sweden and the UK, have banned it regardless of consent. Sweden, for example, has banned operations "on the outer female sexual organs with a view to mutilating them or bringing about some other permanent change in them, regardless of whether or not consent has been given for the operation".&lt;ref name=EigeSweden/&gt; Gynaecologist Birgitta Essén and anthropologist Sara Johnsdotter argue that the law seems to distinguish between Western and African genitals, and deems only African women (such as those seeking reinfibulation after childbirth) unfit to make their own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnsdotter|Essén|2010|loc=33}}; {{harvnb|Essén|Johnsdotter|2004|loc=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] argues that a key concern with FGM is that it is mostly conducted on children using physical force. The distinction between social pressure and physical force is morally and legally salient, comparable to the distinction between seduction and rape. She argues further that the literacy of women in practising countries is generally poorer than in developed nations, which reduces their ability to make informed choices.{{sfn|Nussbaum|1999|loc=123–124}}&lt;ref&gt;Also see [[Yuli Tamir|Yael Tamir]], [http://new.bostonreview.net/BR21.3/Tamir.html "Hands Off Clitoridectomy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051255/http://new.bostonreview.net/BR21.3/Tamir.html |date=8 August 2014 }}, ''Boston Review'', Summer 1996; [[Martha Nussbaum]], [http://new.bostonreview.net/BR21.5/nussbaum.html "Double Moral Standards?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051257/http://new.bostonreview.net/BR21.5/nussbaum.html |date=8 August 2014 }}, ''Boston Review'', October/November 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cascading Milky Way.jpg|thumb|450px|A 360-degree [[panorama]] of the [[Milky Way]] at the [[Very Large Telescope]]. Such a panorama shows the entire field of view (FOV) in a single image.

The '''field of view''' ('''FoV''') is the extent of the observable world that is [[visual perception|seen]] at any given moment. In the case of [[optical instrument]]s or sensors it is a [[solid angle]] through which a detector is sensitive to [[electromagnetic radiation]].

== Humans and animals ==
In the context of human vision, the term "field of view" is typically only used in the sense of a restriction to what is visible by external apparatus, like when wearing spectacles&lt;ref name="Alfano"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alfano | first1 = P.L. | last2 = Michel | first2 = G.F. | title = Restricting the field of view: Perceptual and performance effects | journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume = 70| pages = 35–45| year = 1990 | doi=10.2466/pms.1990.70.1.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[virtual reality]] goggles. Note that eye movements are allowed in the definition but do not change the field of view.

If the analogy of the eye's retina working as a sensor is drawn upon, the corresponding concept in human (and much of animal vision) is the [[visual field]].&lt;ref name="Strasburger"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strasburger | first1 = Hans | last2 = Rentschler | first2 = Ingo | last3 = Jüttner | first3 = Martin | title = Peripheral vision and pattern recognition: a review | journal = Journal of Vision| volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 1–82 | year = 2011 | url = http://www.journalofvision.org/content/11/5/13 | doi=10.1167/11.5.13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as "the number of degrees of visual angle during stable fixation of the eyes".&lt;ref name="Strasburger_Poeppel"&gt;Strasburger, Hans; Pöppel, Ernst (2002). Visual Field. In G. Adelman &amp;amp; B.H. Smith (Eds): ''Encyclopedia of Neuroscience''; 3rd edition, on CD-ROM. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that eye movements are excluded in the definition. Different animals have different visual fields, depending, among others, on the placement of the eyes. [[Human eye#Field of view|Humans]] have a slightly over 210-degree forward-facing horizontal arc of their visual field,&lt;ref name="Traquair"&gt;{{cite book |last = Traquair |first = Harry Moss |date= 1938 |title= An Introduction to Clinical Perimetry, Chpt. 1 |location= London|publisher= Henry Kimpton |pages = 4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some [[Bird vision|birds]] have a complete or nearly complete 360-degree visual field. The vertical range of the visual field in humans is around 150 degrees.&lt;ref name="Traquair" /&gt;

The range of visual abilities is not uniform across the visual field, and varies from animal to animal. For example, [[binocular vision]], which is the basis for [[stereopsis]] and is important for [[depth perception]], covers 114 degrees (horizontally) of the visual field in humans;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howard|first1=Ian P.|last2=Rogers|first2=Brian J.|title=Binocular vision and stereopsis|date=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-508476-4|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8vqITdETe0C&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;ots=JhaI-4InNv&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the remaining peripheral 40 degrees on each side have no binocular vision (because only one [[Human eye|eye]] can see those parts of the visual field). Some birds have a scant 10 or 20 degrees of binocular vision.

Similarly, [[color vision]] and the ability to perceive shape and motion vary across the visual field; in humans color vision and form perception are concentrated in the center of the visual field, while motion perception is only slightly reduced in the periphery and thus has a relative advantage there. The physiological basis for that is the much higher concentration of color-sensitive [[cone cell]]s and color-sensitive [[Parvocellular cell|parvocellular]] [[retinal ganglion cell]]s in the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]] – the central region of the retina, together with a larger [[Cortical Magnification|representation in the visual cortex]] – in comparison to the higher concentration of color-insensitive [[rod cell]]s and motion-sensitive [[Magnocellular cell|magnocellular]] [[retinal ganglion cell]]s in the visual periphery, and smaller cortical representation. Since cone cells require considerably brighter light sources to be activated, the result of this distribution is further that peripheral vision is much more sensitive at night relative to foveal vision (sensitivity is highest at around 20 deg eccentricity).&lt;ref name="Strasburger" /&gt;

== Conversions ==
Many optical instruments, particularly [[binoculars]] or spotting scopes, are advertised with their field of view specified in one of two ways: angular field of view, and linear field of view. Angular field of view is typically specified in degrees, while linear field of view is a ratio of lengths. For example, binoculars with a 5.8 [[Degree (angle)|degree (angular)]] field of view might be advertised as having a (linear) field of view of 102&amp;nbsp;mm per meter. As long as the FOV is less than about 10 degrees or so, the following approximation formulas allow one to convert between linear and angular field of view. Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be the angular field of view in degrees. Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be the linear field of view in millimeters per meter. Then, using the [[small-angle approximation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;A \approx {360^{\circ}\over 2 \pi} \cdot {M\over 1000 } \approx 0.0573 \times M&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M \approx {2 \pi \cdot 1000 \over 360^{\circ}} \cdot A \approx 17.45 \times A&lt;/math&gt;

== Machine vision ==
In [[machine vision]] the lens [[focal length]] and [[image sensor]] size sets up the fixed relationship between the field of view and the working distance. Field of view is the area of the inspection captured on the camera’s imager. The size of the field of view and the size of the camera’s imager directly affect the image resolution (one determining factor in accuracy). Working distance is the distance between the back of the lens and the target object.

== Remote sensing ==
In [[remote sensing]], the [[solid angle]] through which a detector element (a pixel sensor) is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation at any one time, is called ''instantaneous field of view'' or IFOV. A measure of the [[spatial resolution]] of a remote sensing imaging system, it is often expressed as dimensions of visible ground area, for some known sensor [[altitude]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oxford Reference|title=Quick Reference: instantaneous field of view|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100005771|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wynne|first=James B. Campbell, Randolph H.|title=Introduction to remote sensing|year=2011|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=160918176X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NkLmDjSS8TsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=5th|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single pixel IFOV is closely related to concept of ''resolved pixel size'', [[ground resolved distance]], [[ground sample distance]] and [[modulation transfer function]].

==Astronomy==
In [[astronomy]], the field of view is usually expressed as an [[solid angle|angular area]] viewed by the instrument, in [[square degree]]s, or for higher magnification instruments, in square [[arc-minute]]s. For reference the Wide Field Channel on the [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] has a field of view of 10 sq. arc-minutes, and the High Resolution Channel of the same instrument has a field of view of 0.15 sq. arc-minutes. Ground-based survey telescopes have much wider fields of view. The photographic plates used by the [[UK Schmidt Telescope]] had a field of view of 30 sq. degrees. The 1.8 m (71&amp;nbsp;in) [[Pan-STARRS]] telescope, with the most advanced digital camera to date has a field of view of 7 sq. degrees. In the near infra-red WFCAM on [[UKIRT]] has a field of view of 0.2 sq. degrees and the [[VISTA (telescope)|VISTA]] telescope has a field of view of 0.6 sq. degrees. Until recently digital cameras could only cover a small field of view compared to [[photographic plate]]s, although they beat photographic plates in [[quantum efficiency]], linearity and dynamic range, as well as being much easier to process.

== Photography ==
{{main|Angle of view}}

In photography, the field of view is that part of the world that is visible through the camera at a particular position and orientation in space; objects outside the FOV when the picture is taken are not recorded in the photograph. It is most often expressed as the angular size of the view cone, as an [[angle of view]]. For a normal lens, the diagonal field of view can be calculated FOV = 2 arctan(SensorSize/2f), where ''f'' is [[focal length]].

== Video games ==
{{main|Field of view in video games}}

The field of view in [[video game]]s refers to the field of view of the camera looking at the game world, which is dependent on the scaling method used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsygamer.com/fov-in-games/ Feng Zhu School of Design – Field of View in Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10445">'''Freezing behavior''' or the '''freeze response''' is a reaction to specific [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], most commonly observed in prey animals. When a prey animal has been caught and completely overcome by the predator, it may still be possible for the prey to escape by feigning death so that the predator stops the attack.  Studies typically assess a conditioned freezing behavior response to stimuli that typically or innately do not cause fear, such as a tone or shock. Freezing behavior is most easily characterized by changes in blood pressure and lengths of time in crouching position, but it also is known to cause changes such as shortness of breath, increased heart rate, sweating, or choking sensation.&lt;ref name="Ressler"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Ressler, K., Emory University Dept. of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences | title = Lecture | date = 18 Nov 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since it is difficult to measure these sympathetic responses to fear stimuli, studies are typically confined to simple crouching times. A response to stimuli typically is said to be a "[[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]]", but is more completely described as "fight, flight, or freeze." In addition, freezing is observed to occur before or after a fight or flight response.

== Physiology ==

Studies suggest that specific areas of the brain are known to either elicit (or inhibit in the case of lesions) freezing behavior in subjects. The regions include the basolateral amygdala and the hippocampus.

One such study, conducted by Ann E. Power et al., investigated the effects of lesions in the basolateral amygdala.&lt;ref name="Power"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Power AE, McGaugh JL |title=Cholinergic activation of the basolateral amygdala regulates unlearned freezing behavior in rats |journal=Behavioural Brain Research |volume=134 |issue=1–2 |pages=307–15 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12191818 |doi=10.1016/S0166-4328(02)00046-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rats were placed in a chamber containing either real cat hair or fake cat hair. Two groups of rats were tested: rats that had been lesioned in the basolateral amygdala and rats that were the control group (or [[sham-operated group]]). All rats at first froze briefly then retreated away from the stimulus upon initial contact. The results showed that the rats that were lesioned in the basolateral amygdala froze much less to the cat hair than the control group of rats. As expected, both groups of rats froze for a significantly less time when presented with the fake cat hair stimulus than when in the presence of the real cat hair. It was also shown that the both control group and the lesioned group made less contacts with the real cat hair than the fake cat hair. These data infer a connection between the basolateral amygdala and freezing behavior.

Another study, conducted by Gisquet-Verrier et al., tested the effects of the hippocampus, in three experiments, on both the freezing behavior and [[avoidance coping|avoidance]].&lt;ref name="Gisquet"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gisquet-Verrier P, Dutrieux G, Richer P, Doyère V |title=Effects of lesions to the hippocampus on contextual fear: evidence for a disruption of freezing and avoidance behavior but not context conditioning |journal=Behavioral Neuroscience |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=507–22 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10443778 |doi=10.1037/0735-7044.113.3.507}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rats were lesioned with [[ibotenic acid]], and were tested against a control group. They first investigated changes from conditioned fear, and results showed that lesions to the hippocampus did not alter freezing behavior and marginally affected avoidance. Next, they tested single conditioning sessions, and it was found that freezing behavior remained unchanged while avoidance was disrupted. Finally, they tested conditioning with a larger stimulus (footshock intensity). It was found that avoidance was unaltered while freezing behavior decreased. Not only did these investigations show that the hippocampus is involved with freezing behavior, but avoidance and freezing behavior do not seem to have similar ways of being quantified when it comes to fear conditioning.

== Neurotransmitters ==
It has been experimentally tested that particular areas of the brain are involved with freezing behavior. As mentioned before, Ann E. Power investigated the effect of basolateral amygdala on freezing behavior. It was also found that [[muscarinic]] cholinergic activation plays a role in the behavior.&lt;ref name="Power" /&gt; That suggests that neurotransmitters, in general, play a role in freezing behavior.  Several investigations show that freezing behavior is influenced by the following:
*Serotonin&lt;ref name="Hashimoto"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hashimoto S, Inoue T, Koyama T |title=Effects of conditioned fear stress on serotonin neurotransmission and freezing behavior in rats |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=378 |issue=1 |pages=23–30 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10478561 |doi=10.1016/S0014-2999(99)00441-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Antipsychotic Drugs&lt;ref name="Inoue"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Inoue T, Tsuchiya K, Koyama T |title=Effects of typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs on freezing behavior induced by conditioned fear |journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=195–201 |date=October 1996 |pmid=8951954 |doi=10.1016/S0091-3057(96)00064-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Methamphetamine&lt;ref name="Tsuchiya"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsuchiya K, Inoue T, Koyama T |title=Effect of repeated methamphetamine pretreatment on freezing behavior induced by conditioned fear stress |journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=687–91 |date=August 1996 |pmid=8853190 |doi=10.1016/0091-3057(96)00017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Monoamine oxidase inhibitors&lt;ref name="Maki"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maki Y, Inoue T, Izumi T |title=Monoamine oxidase inhibitors reduce conditioned fear stress-induced freezing behavior in rats |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=406 |issue=3 |pages=411–8 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11040348 |doi=10.1016/S0014-2999(00)00706-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hashimoto et al. investigated the effects of conditioned fear on [[serotonin]] and freezing behavior in rats.&lt;ref name="Hashimoto" /&gt; Through [[in vivo]] [[microdialysis]], certain concentrations of extracellular serotonin in the rat brain were able to be measured. It was found that conditioned fear stress increased the levels of the serotonin in the medial prefrontal cortex. This increase was correlated with an increased freezing behavior that was observed. The rats were then given an inhibitor for the extracellular serotonin, which resulted in a reduced freezing behavior. It can be suggested from these results that inhibition of serotonin can decrease freezing behavior and, also, anxiety.

Not only does serotonin influence freezing behavior, but it has been shown that [[antipsychotic drugs]](APDs), such as clozapine, ORG5222, and olanzapine, affect freezing behavior as well.&lt;ref name="Inoue" /&gt; Drugs were administered [[subcutaneously]] to rats 30 minutes before footshock stress. It was observed that, 24 hours following the footshock, freezing behavior was present without shocks. This is interesting to note, since there was a sympathetic response to no stimuli at all. This suggests that antipsychotic drugs alter freezing behavior, making the rats more sensitive to fear stimulus, for example.

[[Methamphetamines]] have also shown that they could affect freezing behavior.&lt;ref name="Tsuchiya" /&gt; Tsuchiya et al. conducted a study investigating the effect of methamphetamine pretreatment on freezing behavior. Rats were given the drug over a week, ramping up the doses. After that, there was a 5-day period without any drugs administered. The rats were then subjected to conditioned fear stress. Repeated but not single methamphetamine pretreatment resulted in a significantly increased freezing behavior. This evidence suggests that previous exposure to chronic methamphetamine results in an increased sensitivity to subsequent stress than a control group.

Just as neurotransmitters influence freezing behavior, [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]], as expected, interrupt neurotransmitters and influence freezing behavior.&lt;ref name="Maki" /&gt; This study examined the effects of [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] on freezing behavior. Rats were treated with specific inhibitors that target either [[monoamine oxidase]] A or B. The results showed that acute inhibition of both monoamine oxidase A and B reduce anxiety or freezing behavior. However, inhibition of monoamine oxidase A or B alone failed to do so.

== Hormones ==
It has been shown that parts of the brain are involved in freezing behavior and that neurotransmitters and similar chemicals influence freezing behavior, as well. In a related manner, hormones, [[progestogens]] and [[estrogen]], also play a role in freezing behavior.&lt;ref name="Frye"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Llaneza DC, Frye CA |title=Progestogens and Estrogen Influence Impulsive Burying and Avoidant Freezing Behavior of Naturally Cycling and Ovariectomized Rats |journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=337–42 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19447128 |doi=10.1016/j.pbb.2009.05.003 |pmc=2744500}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the authors tested the rats in marble burying and conditioned fear when they were in behavioral [[estrous]] or diestrous. Female rats in behavioral estrous have elevated levels of these steroid hormones and also elicit more approach and less freezing behavior than diestrous rats. Results demonstrate that rats in this behavioral estrous show less impulsive burying and also less freezing behavior than diestrous rats. The authors then administered progesterone and estrogen in ovariectomized rats and tested them in marble burying and conditioned fear. The results for this experiment demonstrate that administration of progesterone or both estrogen and progesterone decreases impulsive burying. Both demonstrate a decrease in freezing behavior. The study concludes that "progesterone and/or estrogen may mediate impulsive and/or avoidant behavior." Freezing behavior in a female's cycle is seen to be greatly impacted by levels of hormones. However, there may be future studies on whether testosterone influences freezing behavior as well.

The very high rate of [[HIV]] infection experienced in [[Uganda]] during the 1980s and early 1990s created an urgent need for people to know their HIV status. The only option available to them was offered by the National Blood Transfusion Service, which carries out routine HIV tests on all the blood that is donated for transfusion purposes. Because the need for testing and counseling was great, a group of local non-governmental organizations such as The AIDS Support Organisation (TASO), Uganda Red Cross, Nsambya Home Care, the National Blood Bank, the Uganda Virus Research Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | date=2007 | isbn=9781905746064 | pages=25 | title=Peter Kitonsa Ssebbanja | author=Peter Kitonsa Ssebbanja | editor=Glen Williams | chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with the Ministry of Health established the [[AIDS Information Centre]] in 1990 to provide HIV testing and counseling services with the knowledge and consent of the client involved.

In Uganda, HIV/AIDS has been approached as more than a health issue and in 1992 a Multi-sectoral AIDS Control Approach was adopted. In addition, the Uganda AIDS Commission, also founded in 1992, has helped develop a national HIV/AIDS policy. A variety of approaches to AIDS education have been employed, ranging from the promotion of [[condom]] use to '[[abstinence only]]' programmes.

To further Uganda's efforts in establishing a comprehensive HIV/AIDS program, in 2000 the MOH implemented birth practices and safe infant feeding counseling.  According to the WHO, around 41,000 women received Preventing Mother To child Transmission (PMTCT) services in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=15319679 | year=2004 | last1=Baryarama | first1=F. |last2=Bunnell | first2=R.

The Ugandan government, through President [[Yoweri Museveni]], has promoted this as a success story in the fight against HIV and [[AIDS]], arguing it has been the most effective national response to [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|the pandemic in]] [[sub-Saharan Africa]].  Though equally there has in recent years been growing criticism that these claims are exaggerated, and that the HIV infection rate in Uganda is on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2014/unaids_gap_report_en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620173755/http://files.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2014/unaids_gap_report_en.pdf|title=The Gap Report|archivedate=20 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are striking similarities with the history of HIV/AIDS response in [[Senegal]], where an equally high-level political response was encouraged by the fact that the [[HIV-2]] strain of the disease was discovered by the Senegalese scientist Dr. Mboup.

==History==

An overarching policy known as "ABC", which consisted of abstinence, monogamy, and condoms, was set up with the aim of helping to curb the spread of AIDS in Uganda, where HIV infections reached epidemic proportions in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/aids-uganda.htm "HIV and AIDS in Uganda,"]  Avert.org.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of HIV began to decline in the late 1980s and continued throughout the 1990s. Between 1991 and 2007, HIV prevalence rates declined dramatically. Various claims have been made on the extent of these declines, but mathematical models estimated falls from about 15 percent in 1991 to about 6 percent in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/globalatlas/predefinedReports/EFS2008/short/EFSCountryProfiles2008_UG.pdf Epidemiological Fact Sheet on Uganda]. UNAIDS (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after he came into office in 1986, President Museveni spearheaded a mass education campaign promoting a three-pronged AIDS prevention message: abstinence from sexual activity until marriage; monogamy within marriage; and condoms as a last resort. The message became commonly known as ABC: [[Abstinence, be faithful, use a condom]] if A and B fail. This message also addressed the high rates of concurrency in Uganda, which refers to the widespread cultural practice of maintaining two or more sexual partners at a time. Mass media campaigns also targeting this practice including the "Zero-Grazing" and "Love Carefully" public health messages in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Pisani | first=Elizabeth | title=The Wisdom of Whores | isbn=1847084052 | year=2008 | publisher=Norton &amp; Company | location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government used a multi-sector approach to spread its AIDS prevention message: it developed strong relationships with government, community and religious leaders who worked with the grassroots to teach ABC. Schools incorporated the ABC message into curricula, while faith-based communities trained leaders and community workers in ABC. The government also launched an aggressive media campaign using print, billboards, radio, and television to promote abstinence, monogamy, and condom use.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Condoms were not the main element of the AIDS prevention message in the early years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=HIV Prevention Strategies | url=http://www.avert.org/abc-hiv-prevention.htm | work=Averting HIV and AIDS | accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Museveni said, "We are being told that only a thin piece of rubber stands between us and the death of our Continent ... they (condoms) cannot become the main means of stemming the tide of AIDS."&lt;ref&gt;Address by Janet K. Museveni, First Lady of Uganda at the Medical Institute for Sexual Health's "Common Ground: A Shared Vision for Health" Conference, Washington, D.C., 17–19 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized that condoms should be used, "if you cannot manage A and B ... as a fallback position, as a means of last resort."&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/04apr/00460/en/reality/interviews/062304_kff_uganda.pdf President Museveni of Uganda, Interview with Jackie Judd], Kaiser Family Foundation, 14 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reports suggest that the decline in AIDS prevalence in Uganda was due to monogamy and abstinence, rather than condom use. According to [[Edward C. Green]], a medical anthropologist at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], the promotion of fidelity to one's partner and abstinence were the most important factors in Uganda's success because they disrupted the widespread practice of having multiple concurrent sexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032702825.html | title=Condoms, HIV-AIDS and Africa - The Pope Was Right | last=Green | first=Edward C. | website=The Washington Post | date=29 March 2009 | access-date=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study published in the journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] also concluded that abstinence among young people and monogamy, rather than condom use, contributed to the decline of AIDS in Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.wisdomofwhores.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/stoneburner-2004-population-level.pdf | doi=10.1126/science.1093166 | title=Population-Level HIV Declines and Behavioral Risk Avoidance in Uganda | year=2004 | last1=Stoneburner | first1=R. L. | journal=Science | volume=304 | issue=5671 | pages=714–8 | pmid=15118157 | last2=Low-Beer | first2=D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a field-study conducted in Rakai, a region in southern Uganda, showed that abstinence and fidelity rates had been declining during 1995–2002, but without the expected rise in HIV/AIDS rates, suggesting a greater role for condoms than acknowledged by Museveni. The other central finding of the Rakai study was that, due to Uganda's focus on prevention of the spread of HIV-AIDS, rather than treatment for those who had already contracted the disease, a large part of the decline in prevalence of HIV-AIDS is due to the premature death of those who have contracted it. This led to the popular play on the ABC campaign, 'A-B-C-D', with the D standing for Death. Because only prevalence is measured, incidence can actually increase while prevalence decreases if those who contract HIV are not treated for the disease, thereby dying younger. Later studies have seriously questioned the veracity of Uganda's miraculous HIV-AIDS claims {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

In the 1990s there had been limited access to treatment in the form of anti-retrovirals for those who are HIV positive. Through the combined effort of US PEPFAR, the government of Uganda, and international agencies (Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative, the Global Fund, UNITAID) this has improved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plusnews.org/Report/90288/UGANDA-Optimism-as-PEPFAR-increases-funding UGANDA: Optimism as PEPFAR increases funding*]. PlusNews (2010-08-25)&lt;/ref&gt; The country's HIV-AIDS campaign focuses solely on prevention rather than cure, and that prevention is of questionable success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/24/MNG2PBG3VF1.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Uganda's HIV rate drops, but not from abstinence / Study concludes basis of Bush policy apparently irrelevant | first=Sabin | last=Russell | date=24 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The scope of Uganda's success has come under scrutiny from new research. Research published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' medical journal in 2002 questions the dramatic decline reported. It is claimed statistics have been distorted through the inaccurate extrapolation of data from small urban clinics to the entire population, nearly 90% of whom live in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12114061|year=2002|last1=Parkhurst|first1=JO|title=The Ugandan success story?

[http://www.mindfully.org/Health/2006/AIDS-Medical-Corruption1mar06.htm Out of Control] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114173724/http://www.mindfully.org/Health/2006/AIDS-Medical-Corruption1mar06.htm |date=2007-11-14 }}. Harper's Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States|US]]-sponsored abstinence promotions have received recent criticism from observers for denying young people information about any method of HIV prevention other than sexual abstinence until marriage. [[Human Rights Watch]] says that such programmes "leave Uganda’s children at risk of HIV".&lt;ref name="abstinence"&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/03/30/uganda10380.htm "Uganda: 'Abstinence-Only' Programs Hijack AIDS Success Story"], ''[[Human Rights Watch]]'' (2005-03-30).&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, the Roman Catholic organization [[Human Life International]] says that "condoms are adding to the problem, not solving it" and that "The government of Uganda believes its people have the human capacity to change their risky behaviors."&lt;ref name="abstinence2"&gt;
[http://www.catholicexchange.com/vm/index.asp?vm_id=1&amp;art_id=34228 "An open letter to Melinda Gates"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051314/http://www.catholicexchange.com/vm/index.asp?vm_id=1&amp;art_id=34228 |date=2007-09-28 }}, Human Life International (2006-08-29).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is feared that HIV prevalence in Uganda may be rising again; at best it has reached a plateau where the number of new HIV infections matches the number of AIDS-related deaths.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} 
There are many theories as to why this may be happening, including the government’s shift from abstinence-based prevention programmes, and a general complacency or 'AIDS fatigue'.
It has been suggested that antiretroviral drugs have changed the perception of AIDS from a death sentence to a treatable, manageable disease; this may have reduced the fear surrounding HIV, and in turn have led to an increase in risky behaviour. Although prevention interventions, like safe male circumcision, have been shown to effectively reduce HIV transmission, studies in Uganda have shown delayed uptake of these interventions and attributed this to contestations over evidence by high-level leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ssengooba|first=Freddie|title=Research translation to inform national health policies: learning from multiple perspectives in Uganda|journal=BMC International Health and Human Rights|year=2011|volume=11|pages=S13|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/research-translation-to-inform-national-health-policies-lear.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1186/1472-698X-11-S1-S13|pmid=21411000|pmc=3059472|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although abstinence has always been part of the country’s prevention strategy it has come under scrutiny since 2003 following significant investment of money for abstinence-only programmes from [[PEPFAR]], the [[United States|American]] government’s initiative to combat the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is felt that PEPFAR has shifted the focus of prevention in Uganda from the comprehensive ABC approach of earlier years. PEPFAR is channelling large sums of money through pro-abstinence and even anti-condom organisations that are faith-based, and believe sexual abstinence should be the central pillar of the fight against HIV. Abstinence-only is also being encouraged by [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] churches within Uganda, and by the First Lady, [[Janet Museveni]].

This money is making a difference – some Ugandan teachers report being instructed by US contractors not to discuss condoms in schools because the new policy is 'abstinence only'. Dozens of billboards around the country have sprung up promoting only abstinence to prevent HIV infection and sometimes discouraging condom use. Some leaders of small community-based organisations also report they are aware that they are more likely to receive money from PEPFAR (which is the largest HIV-related donor to the country) if they mention abstinence in their funding proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/aids-uganda.htm HIV and AIDS in Uganda]. Avert.org (2012-09-21). Retrieved on 2012-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been calls for a more nuanced view of Uganda's response to HIV/AIDS. There is no doubt that there has been sustained, long term political commitment at the highest levels of government on this issue. In other countries such as Zimbabwe or South Africa, inept leadership has led to a serious crisis; some such as former President Thabo Mbeki deny the link between HIV and AIDS.

One aspect of the response to HIV in Uganda bridges the Millennium Development Goals and prevention—that is vertical transmission or Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission (PMTCT).  Through the Global Fund's Born HIV Free campaign [http://www.bornhivfree.org/f/#/en/home BornHIVFree] the need and impact of PMTCT is made clear.  Funding is encouraged by UNITAID and [http://www.massivegood.org/en_US/news-feed/220 MassiveGood]

== Structure of health provision ==
The provision of all health services in Uganda is shared between three groups: the government staffed and funded medical facilities; private for profit or self-employed medics including midwives and traditional birth attendants; and, NGO or philanthropic medical services.  The international health  funding and research community, such as the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria, or bilateral donors are very active in Uganda.  Part of the success in managing HIV/AIDS in Uganda has been due to the cooperation between the government and the non-government service providers and these international bodies.  Public Private Partnerships in Health are often mentioned in Europe and North America to fund construction or research.  In Uganda, it is more practical being the recognition by the (public) government and (public) donor that a (private) philanthropic health facility can receive free test kits for HIV screening, free mosquito nets and water purification to reduce opportunistic infections and free testing and treatment for basic infections of great danger to PLHA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://povertynewsblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/hope-clinic-gives-hope-to-hopeless.html Poverty News Blog: Hope Clinic Gives Hope to the Hopeless].

== Alternative proposals ==

Several studies, conducted in Uganda and its neighbors, indicate that adult male circumcision may be a cost-effective means of reducing HIV infection. A 2007 review of studies about the acceptability of adult male circumcision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=17053855 | pmc=1847541 | year=2007 | last1=Westercamp | first1=N. | last2=Bailey | first2=R.

Sixty nine percent (range 47–79 percent) of women favored circumcision for their partners, and 71 percent (range 50–90 percent) of men and 81 percent (range 70–90 percent) of women were willing to circumcise their sons. The national AIDS Indicator survey in 2011 also indicated that over 48 percent of adult men were willing to be circumcised, generating a critical mass of demand for male circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/AIS10/AIS10.pdf | title=Uganda Aids Indicator Survey 2011 | date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An economic analysis by  Bertran Auvert, a physiciann from the INSERM U687, Saint-Maurive, France, and colleagues estimated the cost of a roll-out over an initial 5-year period would be $1036 million ($748 – $1319 million) and $965 million ($763 – $1301 million) for private and public health sectors, respectively. The cumulative net cost over the first 10 years was estimated at $1271 million and $173 million for the private and public sectors, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/560359 Economic Analysis Supports Adult Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa], E.

'''Hesy-Ra''' (also read '''Hesy-Re''' and '''Hesire''') was an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian high official during the early [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|3rd dynasty]]. His most notable title was ''Wer-ibeh-senjw'', meaning either "Great one of the ivory cutters" or "Great one of the dentists", which would make him the earliest dentist whose name is known to us.  His tomb is noted for its paintings and cedar wood panels.

== Identity ==
Thanks to several clay seal impressions found in Hesy-Ra's tomb, it is today known that this high official lived and worked during the reign of king ([[pharaoh]]) [[Djoser]] and maybe also under king [[Sekhemkhet]].&lt;ref name="WOHE"/&gt;

Hesy-Ra's name is of some interest to Egyptologists and Historians alike, because it is linked to the sun god Re. Hesy-Ra, alongside a few high officials at this time, belongs to the first high officials that were allowed to link their names to Re. However, they were not allowed to use the sun disk hieroglyph to write Re's name. This was permitted to the king only.&lt;ref name="WOHE"&gt;Wolfgang Helck: ''Geschichte des alten Ägypten'' (= ''Handbuch der Orientalistik. Abt. 1: Der Nahe und der Mittlere Osten.

=== Titles ===
As a high-ranking official and priest, Hesy-Ra bore several elite and pious titularies:&lt;ref name="JFNA"&gt;John F. Nunn: ''Ancient Egyptian Medicine.''

=== Career ===
Hesy-Ra is well known for certain, unique titles. The most discussed title is ''Wer-ibeh-senjw'', which can be translated in many ways. ''Ibeh'' can be translated as "dentition" and/or "ivory" as well. ''Senjw'' is a plural for "arrows", "cutters" and/or "physicians" alike. Thus, the full title ''Wer-ibeh-senjw'' can either be translated as "Great one of the ivory cutters" or as "Great one of the dentists". If the former translation was correct, Hesy-Ra was a professional ivory-cutter and artist - a profession that was fairly common and already attested in early dynastic inscriptions. If the latter translation was correct, Hesy-Ra would be the very first person in Egyptian history to be officially entitled as an occupational dentist.&lt;ref name="JFNA"/&gt;

Hesy-Ra is also well known for his richly decorated [[cedar wood]] panels found in his tomb. On these panels, Hesy-Ra is depicted in several stages of age. Indeed, the panels close to the entrance show Hesy-Ra as a pretty young man at the start of his career. Closer to the remembrance chapel, Hesy-Ra is depicted as a mid-age man at the heyday of his career. Finally, in the remembrance chapel, he is depicted as an old man, sitting on an offering table and being stuffed in a tight gown. The artist of the panels even accentuated facial mannerisms of age: Hesy-Ra's face change from pretty smooth to wrinkled and saggy, depending on the stage of age that was meant to be depicted.&lt;ref name="HAGF"&gt;Henriette Antonia Groenewegen-Frankfort: ''Arrest and movement.

Furthermore, Hesy-Ra is known for the colorful wall paintings discovered inside and outside his tomb. Colors such as black, white, yellow, green and red were used. The ornaments include [[rhombus|rhomboids]], stripes and a green-yellowish reed mat imitation. The paintings were in such good state when found, that the excavators decided to fill the painted corridors with high quality rubble in attempt to preserve the colors. Close-by reliefs depict daily life goods and even game accessories, such as [[Mehen]] game boards and a [[Senet]] play set.&lt;ref name="HAGF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WDAM"/&gt;

{{main|Mastaba of Hesy-Re}}
Hesy-Ra's tomb, [[mastaba]] ''S-2405'', is situated in [[Saqqara]]; it was discovered in 1861 by [[France|French]] archaeologists [[Auguste Mariette]] and [[Jacques de Morgan]]. Excavations started in 1910 and ended in 1912, organized and performed by [[Great Britain|British]] archaeologist [[James Edward Quibell]]. Hesy-Ra's tomb is squeezed in between dozens of others, approximately 260&amp;nbsp;m north-east of king [[Djoser]]'s pyramid complex. In its original state, the mastaba was 43&amp;nbsp;m long, 22&amp;nbsp;m wide and 5&amp;nbsp;m high. It was made of hardened mud bricks. Inner and outer walls were once completely and smoothly covered with white [[limestone]]. The inner room structure consisted of a long, niched corridor and several rooms and chapels.&lt;ref&gt;Emad El-Metwally: ''Entwicklung der Grabdekoration in den altägyptischen Privatgräbern.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6200">'''Human milk oligosaccharides''' (HMO, also known as human milk glycans) are sugar molecules, that are part of the oligosaccharides group and which can be found in high concentrations exclusively in [[Breast milk|human breast milk]]. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;L. Bode: ''Human milk oligosaccharides: every baby needs a sugar mama.'' In: ''Glycobiology.'' Band 22, Nummer 9, September 2012, S.&amp;nbsp;1147–1162, {{DOI|10.1093/glycob/cws074}}, {{PMID|22513036}}, {{PMC|3406618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Human milk oligosaccharides form the third most abundant solid component ([[Solution|dissolved]] or [[Emulsion|emulsified]] or [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in water) of human milk after [[lactose]] and [[fat]].&lt;ref&gt;X. Chen: ''Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOS): Structure, Function, and Enzyme-Catalyzed Synthesis.'' In: ''Advances in carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry.'' Band 72, 2015, S.&amp;nbsp;113–190, {{DOI|10.1016/bs.accb.2015.08.002}}, {{PMID|26613816}}.&lt;/ref&gt; HMOs are present in a concentration of 0.35 - 0.88 oz / L. Approximately 200 structurally different human milk oligosaccharides are known. The composition of human milk oligosaccharides in breast milk is individual to each mother and varies over the [[Breastfeeding|period of lactation]]. The dominant oligosaccharide in 80% of all women is [[2'-Fucosyllactose|2'-fucosyllactose]], which is present in human breast milk at a concentration of approximately 0.088 oz/ L.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Katja Parschat, Bettina Gutiérrez|Periodical=[[dei – die ernährungsindustrie]]|Title=Fermentativ erzeugte humane Milch-Oligosaccharide wirken präbiotisch.|At=p.&amp;nbsp;38|Date=2016-11|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
In contrast to the other components of breast milk that are absorbed by the infant through breastfeeding, HMOs are [[Digestion|indigestible]] for the newborn child. However, they have a [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] effect and serve as food for intestinal bacteria, especially [[Bifidobacterium|bifidobacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Le Doare, B. Holder, A. Bassett, P. S. Pannaraj: ''Mother's Milk: A Purposeful Contribution to the Development of the Infant Microbiota and Immunity.'' In: ''Frontiers in immunology.'' Band 9, 2018, S.&amp;nbsp;361, {{DOI|10.3389/fimmu.2018.00361}}, {{PMID|29599768}}, {{PMC|5863526}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The dominance of these intestinal bacteria in the gut reduces the colonization with [[Pathogen#Pathogenicity|pathogenic]] [[bacteria]] (probiosis) and thereby ensures a healthy [[Gut flora#Intestinal flora|intestinal flora]] (intestinal microbiome) and a reduced risk of dangerous intestinal infections.

Recent studies also suggest that HMOs significantly lower the risk of viral and bacterial [[Infection|infections]] and thus diminish the chance to get diarrhoea and respiratory diseases.

This protective function of the HMOs is activated when in contact with specific [[Pathogen|pathogens]], such as certain bacteria or [[Virus|viruses]]. These have the ability to bind themselves to the glycan [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] (receptors for long chains of connected sugar molecules on the surface of human cells) located on the surface of the intestinal cells and can thereby infect the cells of the [[Intestinal epithelium|intestinal mucosa]]. Researchers have discovered that HMOs mimic these glycan receptors so the pathogens bind themselves to the HMOs rather than the intestinal cells. This reduces the risk of an infection with a pathogen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
In addition to this, HMOs seem to influence the reaction of specific cells of the [[immune system]] in a way that reduces [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] responses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;D. S. Newburg, Y. He: ''Neonatal Gut Microbiota and Human Milk Glycans Cooperate to Attenuate Infection and Inflammation.'' In: ''Clinical obstetrics and gynecology.'' Band 58, Nummer 4, Dezember 2015, S.&amp;nbsp;814–826, {{DOI|10.1097/GRF.0000000000000156}}, {{PMID|26457857}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suspected that HMOs reduce the risk of [[Preterm birth|premature infants]] becoming infected with the potentially life-threatening disease [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] (NEC).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some of the [[Metabolite|metabolites]] directly affect the [[nervous system]] or the [[brain]] and can sometimes influence the development and behavior of children in the long term. There are studies that indicate certain HMOs supply the child with [[sialic acid]] residues. Sialic acid is an [[Nutrient#Essential nutrients|essential nutrient]] for the development of the child’s brain and mental abilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

HMOs are used as supplements in [[baby food]] to ensure a provision of babies that are not being breastfed with this important component of the human milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ralph Ammann|Periodical=European Dairy Magazine|Title=Achieving the impossible|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;30 f.|Date=2017-05|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
In experiments designed to test the suitability of HMOs as a prebiotic source of carbon for intestinal bacteria it was discovered that they are highly selective for a commensal bacteria known as ''[[Bifidobacterium longum|Bifidobacteria longum biovar infantis]]''. The presence of genes unique to ''[[Bifidobacterium longum|B. infantis]]'', including co-regulated glycosidases, and its efficiency at using HMOs as a carbon source may imply a co-evolution of HMOs and the genetic capability of select bacteria to utilize them.&lt;ref name="HMO-EVOLUTION"&gt;{{cite journal|last=German|first=JB|last2=Lebrilla|first2=CB|last3=Mills|first3=DA|date=18 Apr 2012|title=Human milk oligosaccharides: evolution, structures and bioselectivity as substrates for intestinal bacteria|journal=Nestle Nutr Workshop Ser Pediatr Program|series=Nestlé Nutrition Workshop Series: Pediatric Program|publisher=|volume=62|issue=|pages=205–22|doi=10.1159/000146322|isbn=978-3-8055-8553-8|pmc=2861563|pmid=18626202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration is the movement of an individual or group of peoples to a foreign country to live permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = immigration – definition of immigration in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/immigration|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1788, when the first British settlers arrived in [[Botany Bay]], immigrants have travelled from all four corners of the world to establish a life in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = European discovery and the colonisation of Australia {{!}} australia.gov.au|url = http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/european-discovery-and-colonisation|website = www.australia.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for people or groups of peoples moving to Australia varies. Such reasons can be due to seeking [[Employment|work]] or even
refuge from [[Third World|third world countries]]. The health of immigrants entering Australia varies depending on the individual's country of origin and the circumstance of which they came, as well as their state of travel to Australia. Immigrants are known to enter Australia both legally and illegally, and this can affect one's health immensely.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Once in Australia, immigrants are given the opportunity to access a high quality of healthcare services, however, the usage of these services can differ dependent on the culture and place of birth of the individual.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Researchers have proven this. Australia has [[strict]] health regulations that have to be met before one is allowed access into Australia and can determine if one is granted or denied such access. The [[quarantine]] process of immigrants into Australia has been in place since 1830, starting at the [[North Head Quarantine Station]] and continues all over Australia.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Australia's immigrants ==

=== Europeans ===
In 1788, the first fleet of British immigrants established a colony in Australia. The arrival of the Europeans in the 1800s, saw those from Italy, [[Greece]], [[Poland]], [[Malta]], Russia and [[Foreign relations of France|France]] land on the shores of Australia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Upon embarking, it is expected that the European immigrants would have carried [[infectious diseases]] aboard the ships, and given the nature of the [[Marine vessel|vessels]], any disease would have spread quickly amongst the [[passenger]]s. [[Report]]s by Mark Stainforth suggest that many forms of bacteria and [[virus]]es caused high levels of illness and on-board deaths amongst those European immigrants travelling to Australia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Because of these viruses and infections that spread amongst European immigrants before reaching Australia, upon arrival, a [[majority]] of immigrants were of ill health.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The immigration of European settlers introduced such bacteria and viruses to Australia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Chinese ===
According to the 1861 Colonial Census, Chinese-born persons made up 3.4% of the Australian population,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.health.qld.gov.au/multicultural Services, Q., H., M. (2011) Chinese Australians. Retrieved from]&lt;/ref&gt; equating to approximately 38,258 Chinese in Australia after 1842 when the Chinese first settled in Australia. Some arrived in Australia hoping to escape the civil disorder of China, although the majority of Chinese migrated to Australia after hearing about the gold rush.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:New arrivals.jpg|thumb|Chinese immigrants upon arrival]]
Within Australia, the average [[life expectancy]] is 81.7 years of age, while those individuals who are born in China have an average of 74.7 years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = ps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html|title = Central Intelligence Agency|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = The World Factbook|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queensland Health Multicultural Services suggests that [[Ischaemic heart disease]], cancer and [[cerebrovascular disease]] are the major causes of China-born passing in Australia. Such cancers that have been identified include nasopyarynx, [[Lung cancer|lung]], [[Intestine cancer|intestine]], [[rectum]], [[stomach]] and [[liver cancer]], all of which are prominent amongst Chinese immigrants.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Afghans ===
After the 1860s, those from [[Afghanistan]] settled in Australia establishing work in [[Outback|outback Australia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Afghans who migrate to Australia face several disadvantages when accessing [[health services]]. Disadvantages include language barriers, a lack of translators in Australian health Services, and the incompatibility of some Australian healthcare services and procedures with Islamic beliefs.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[http://www.health.qld.gov.au/multicultural Services, Q., H., M. (2011) Afghan Australians. Retrieved from]&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals experience a sense of alienation and lack of belonging as they are put in a situation that makes them feel like [[outcast (person)|outcasts]] compared to the rest of Australia. However, while there are clear disadvantages for Afghans in regards to health services, the Queensland Health Multicultural Services have suggested that Afghans use Australian heath services just as much as Australian-born individuals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

It is reported that the average age expectancy of an Afghan, both male and female, is 44.6 years of age.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Studies have also proven that Afghanistan has the fourth highest mortality rate and second highest [[infant mortality]] in the world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Children ===
The [[Royal Children's Hospital]] in Melbourne have conducted a study that identifies the following amongst children who have immigrated to Australia.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Immigrant Health Service : Overview of health issues in immigrant children|url = http://www.rch.org.au/immigranthealth/clinical/Overview_of_health_issues_in_immigrant_children/|website = www.rch.org.au|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quarantine and health requirements ==

=== Early years ===
[[File:Q Station+whales cropped.jpg|thumb|North Head Quarantine Station]]
In the 1830s, the immigrants that arrived by boat on the shores of Sydney were suspected to be carrying [[contagious diseases]]. During this period, [[influenza]], [[Typhoid fever|typhoid]], [[scarlet fever]] and whopping cough were all found on European ships arriving in Australia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Diet, disease and death at sea on the voyage to Australia, 1837–1839|last = Stainforth|first = Mark|date = 1996|journal = International Journal of Maritime History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To contain such diseases, the ships were stopped at [[North Head Quarantine Station]] where the authority would place the passengers and crew into quarantine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa/Heal/overview-of-the-health-requirement/threats-to-public-health|title = Department of Immigration and Border Protection|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Government|first = Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Government (2015) suspects that each passenger would have spent on average, 40 days in [[quarantine]] before being released into Australia, as Australian residents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each experience within North Head varied and was dependent on class. Some immigrants were exposed to further disease, disempowerment and in some cases death. In the beginning, [[North Head Quarantine Station]] provided tents for those immigrants who came to Australia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in 1837, those who appeared to be healthy were those who were granted [[Dwelling|accommodation]] in the tents, while those who were sick were required to stay on the ship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Australian government]] suggests that in the year of 1837, 295 healthy immigrants were kept ashore while those who were contagious or otherwise were kept on the ship. The North Head Quarantine Station's facilities continued to grow. However, between 1860 and 1870, the quarantine station took a turn for the worst when the world economy decelerated along with immigration. As a result, an outbreak of [[smallpox]] occurred due to insufficient maintenance of the [[North Head Quarantine Station]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was only in 1909, when the [[Commonwealth government]] took over North Head Quarantine, that the station attained a maximum volume of 1200 people.

=== Government health requirements ===
In order to ensure Australia's health and safety, the Government is required to examine all immigrants prior to entering Australia. Those who seek either a permanent or temporary visa are part of this application. All candidates are checked for [[Tuberculosis]], HIV and [[Hepatitis]], Yellow fever, [[Poliomyelitis|Polio]] and the [[Ebola virus disease]] (EVD). In order to be allowed access into Australia, you must be cleared of all of these diseases and deemed to be no threat to Australian communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Australian health services ==

=== Current health care system ===
The [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] system in Australia is a publicly funded system that is designed to provide heavily subsidised costs for all Australians, including those foreign born immigrants who either have a [[citizenship]], a working visa, a permanent visa, or one who is married to an Australian citizen.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Straiton | first1 = M. | last2 = Grant | first2 = J. F. | last3 = Winefield | first3 = H. R. | last4 = Taylor | first4 =  | year = 2014 | title = Mental health in immigrant men and women in Australia: The north west adelaide health study. . | url = | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1111–1111 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-14-1111 | pmid=25349060 | pmc=4228163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health care difficulties for immigrants ===
For those who migrate to Australia, there are many disadvantages in the way of healthcare. The [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] provides well supported healthcare for immigrants, however, those immigrants who arrive in Australia are struck by culture and communication barriers as well as a lack of knowledge when it comes to the cost of health services and knowing their rights.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=ABC |date=3 April 2003 |title=Consumer guides: Migrant health services |url=http://www.abc.net.au/health/consumerguides/stories/2003/04/03/1837445.htm |accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cultural barriers ====
[[Culture|Cultural]] barriers felt by immigrants include the Australians perceptions of health as well as their [[Behavior|behaviour]] when sick.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Such differences are determined by ones [[cultural heritage]]. It is also prominent that some immigrants are concerned that doctors will not recognise or understand their specific cultural needs. Such examples include the needs of women from the Middle East. Such women are fearful of male doctors examining them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ABC (2015) states that "different cultural groups have specific expectations. For example, Jehovah's Witness followers will refuse to have blood transfusions, believing it is polluting."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Jahovah's Witness Tradition: Religious beliefs and healthcare decisions|last = DuBose|first = Edwin|publisher = The park ridge centre|year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Communication barriers ====
For those immigrants coming to Australia from non-English speaking backgrounds, [[Communication|communication barriers]] can influence one's health experience, whether it be negative or positive.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The ABC (2015) states that non-English speaking immigrants can turn to saying 'yes' in [[stress (psychological)|stressful]] situation in order to avoid further communication with healthcare services.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This can have great impacts on the individual as they may not receive the help they need as a [[result]], or they will choose not to contact health services as they are wary of the communication barriers and believe it is easier to avoid the situation. This could result in the individual's health deteriorating as a result of lack of attention.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Cost of healthcare ====
When immigrants arrive in Australia, it is evident that a lack of money and understanding of the [[healthcare system]] can lead to immigrants avoiding the services. Therefore, it is vital for immigrants, upon arrival, are noted of their rights in regards to free healthcare. Those immigrants who have access to [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] are:
* Permanent residents&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Those who await the final process of their permanent residency claim.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Countries such as Finland, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, Malta, Ireland and New Zealand have an agreement with the [[Health care in Australia|Australian healthcare system]] that grants immigrants from the above countries with access to Medicare.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Patient rights ====
It has been identified that immigrants from non-English speaking backgrounds, tend to feel less empowered, resulting in the patients becoming reticent. Non-English speak immigrants tend not to ask questions. As a result, many individuals are discouraged from visiting the services again, which can lead to the [[Ill-health|ill health]] of immigrants that are new to Australia.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

These factors can be reduced if new arrivals to Australia are aware of their rights.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights {{!}} Safety and Quality|url = http://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/national-priorities/charter-of-healthcare-rights/|website = www.safetyandquality.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; All patients have the right to:
* Ask for a doctor of a particular sex.
* What privacy they wish for.
* An interpreter.
* Complain if they feel necessary.
Between 2007 and 2008, an Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights was established by the commission.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This charter provides a clear outline of the rights of those seeking healthcare, and is directed at patients, consumers, families, carers and service providers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This charter can be applied in all health settings in Australia. These include, public hospitals,. general practices and other environments.

=== Health studies ===

A study has been undertaken, comparing the [[mental health]] of men and women in Australia, identifying the differences between Australian born and [[Alien (law)|foreign]] born
individuals.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental health in immigrant men and women in Australia: the North West Adelaide health study|url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/1111/abstract|journal = BMC Public Health|date = 28 October 2014|issn = 1471-2458|pmc = 4228163|pmid = 25349060|pages = 1111|volume = 14|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-14-1111|first = Melanie|last = Straiton|first2 = Janet F.|last2 = Grant|first3 = Helen R.|last3 = Winefield|first4 = Anne|last4 = Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve the following results, a diagnosis of [[mental health]], current [[Depression (clinical)|depression]], [[medical service]] use and use of [[Medications|medication]] have been studied.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Three groups of individuals:&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
# Australian born
# English speaking foreign born
# Non-English speaking foreign born

The study has proven that both foreign born and Australian born groups of people access [[mental health]] services at an equal rate. However, non-English speaking foreign born
men have demonstrated an increased risk of [[mental health]] issues and access health services less than Australian born men.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; These results suggest that the government and health services need to be made aware of these particular health issues among non-English speaking foreign born men, in particular those men who unmarried, unemployed and live alone. The findings of this study identify the importance of [[social support]] to prevent [[Mental health|mental health issues]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Health of illegal immigrants ==
Whilst most immigrants and [[refugee]]s travel to Australia legally, there are others who travel to Australia illegally.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shaw | first1 = M. T. M. | last2 = Leggat | first2 = P. A. | year = 2006 | title = Medical screening and the health of illegal immigrants in Australia | url = | journal = Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease | volume = 4 | issue = 5| pages = 255–258 | doi = 10.1016/j.tmaid.2005.06.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newman | first1 = L. | last2 = Lightfoot | first2 = T. | last3 = Singleton | first3 = G. | last4 = Aroche | first4 = J. | last5 = Yong | first5 = C. | last6 = Eagar | first6 = S. | last7 = Detention Health | first7 = Advisory Group | year = 2010 | title = Mental illness in Australian immigration detention centres | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9723| pages = 1344–1345 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60571-5 | pmid=20399975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who seek refuge in Australia illegally travel by boat, most of which are intercepted by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] patrolling the [[Australian Border Force|Australian border]]. From there, the Royal Australian Navy pass the refugees on to [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service|Australian Customs]] for detention.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There are many risks associated with entering Australia illegally and considering the conditions of travel, the deterioration of persons on board is prevalent.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Most immigrants and refugees have been exposed to a variety of infectious diseases and [[psychological trauma]], making the health of these individuals paramount for the [[Health professional]]s working in [[detention (imprisonment)|detention centres]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It is exceedingly difficult to acquire a precise [[medical history]] of the individuals considering the circumstances of which most refugees and illegal immigrants have escaped from.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Dependent on the individual and their [[Country of origin principle|country of origin]], the degree of [[nutrition]]al and [[infectious disease]] varies. However, it has been noted that upper and lower [[respiratory tract]] infection, [[Parasitic disease|parasitic]] and intestinal infections are frequent findings amounts illegal immigrants.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Within Australian detention centres and amongst illegal immigrants, the presence of HIV, [[tuberculosis]] and [[Hepatitis|hepatitis A and B]] have been detected, prompting concerns for fellow detainees. However, such diseases appear to be low in Australia.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Whilst the minority of illegal immigrants are females, pregnancy has been evident and therefore maternal healthcare is vital to ensure the health of both the mother and unborn child. Dental health amongst detainees is poor with the severe cases being acknowledged and attended to within the detention centres.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

More than 20% of [[asylum seekers]] who seek refuge in Australia appear to have suffered as a result of [[torture]] prior to arriving in Australia.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Therefore, psychiatric conditions are prevalent in detention camps. [[Anxiety]] and [[stress (psychological)|stress]] within the facilities has been emphasised by the lack of social support, unemployment and discrimination.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This psychological stress felt by detainees can be enhanced by the confined environment of the detention camps. Amongst the men and women, children have also been reported for suffering prolonged [[psychological]] conditions. Whilst there are psychological impacts on the immigrants, there are also those who are affected by physical conditions such as [[osteomyelitis]] or [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Immunisation ===
It is stated that [[vaccination]]s will not be given to those who arrive in Australia as [[refugee]]s or [[Refugee|asylum seekers]] due to the individual or group of people's country of origin and the different immunisation schedules that they uphold.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Immigrant Health Service: Overview of health issues in immigrant children|url = http://www.rch.org.au/immigranthealth/clinical/Overview_of_health_issues_in_immigrant_children/|website = www.rch.org.au|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been suggested that refugees and asylum seekers should be vaccinated according to the Australian National Immunisation Program Schedule; unless [[documentation]] of prior immunisation is provided, catch-up vaccinations are required.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In this regard, it has been argued that it is necessary for immigrants to be immunised to ensure the health and safety of fellow [[Australians]]. Nevertheless, there is a competing principle to afford every immigrant and [[Australian citizen]] an equal opportunity to uphold their cultural beliefs.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In this regard, some have questioned the [[Australian government]]'s right to strip these refugees and [[asylum seekers]] of their cultural beliefs and understandings in regards to their health.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Prolonged health issues ===
In 1992, [[mandatory detention]] was introduced for refugees and [[asylum seekers]] entering Australia illegally.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Immigration detention in Australia – Parliament of Australia|url = http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/2012-2013/Detention|website = www.aph.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the introduction of mandatory detention has triggered debate. The importance of protecting Australia's borders and integrity of Australia's immigration system was the initial reason for the policy,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; while those who question the policy and Australian Government's decision argue whether it is good for both parties (the refugees and Australian citizens), stating that it is [[inhumane]] and ineffective as it is proven to cause further health issues for the refugees and asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 'Pacific Solution' revisited: a statistical guide to the asylum seeker caseloads on Nauru and Manus Island – Parliament of Australia|url =http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/parliamentary_departments/parliamentary_library/pubs/bn/2012-2013/pacificsolution|website = www.aph.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Flood]], the former Secretory of the Department of Foreign Affairs, undertook an investigation into mandatory detention.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Several circumstances of self-harm, psychiatric problems and sexual, verbal and physical abuse of children were documented by Flood.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The final report identifies and expresses concerns in regards to the condition of which the refugees and asylum seekers are living, as well the Department's management of long-term detention and the impact this can have on young children.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

This debate against mandatory detention identifies the negatives and prolonged health issues that can arise from long-term detention.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; It has been recommended that once asylum seekers and refugees are cleared of the initial checks, such as those of [[Personal identity|identity and health]], that they are then released into community detention or
granted a bridging visa whilst waiting for their refugee status to be determined.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; However, further studies prove that keeping such illegal immigrants in mandatory detention protects the Australian community whilst the legitimacy of the [[Refugees|refugees and asylum seekers]] is being assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ParlInfo – Australian Government assistance to refugees: fact versus fiction|url = http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%253A%2522library%252Fprspub%252F1311498%2522|website = parlinfo.aph.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of force in immigration detention facilities ===
Those authorised officers within [[immigration detention]] centres are given the power to use force against [[Refugee|asylum seekers]] and refugees.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Use of force in immigration detention facilities {{!}} Australian Human Rights Commission|url = https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/publications/use-force-immigration-detention-facilities|website = www.humanrights.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is stated within the 2015 [[Bill (law)|bill]] to maintain good order of immigration facilities. The [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] recognises the environment of particular detention facilities and force may be essential in specific circumstances. However, the Commission argues that the bill is deficient because:&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
* The necessity and reasonableness of force should be assessed in every situation. The force used must be consistent with the [[Crimes Act]] and the policies regarding the use of force in immigration detention facilities.
* The use and limits of force that is stated in the policies and procedures, should be included in the Act.
* The forceful movement of immigrants and force used upon children should be controlled and limited within immigration detention facilities.

It is evident{{According to whom|date=August 2016}} that while force may be need in certain circumstances, the use of force must be appropriate and respect the immigrant's inherent right to be treated with [[respect]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Concerns have arisen in regards to 'authorised officers' [[Abuse|abusing]] the rights of the detained immigrants and therefore [[Reinforcement|reinforcing]] the recommendation for the Bill to be altered and reworded by the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] will be able to ensure that use of force used in immigration facilities is managed and acted out [[appropriately]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Children in immigration detention facilities ===
The particular environment of immigration detention facilities has been proven to have negative impacts on young children, [[Compromise|compromising]] their [[mental health]] and [[physical health]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] has recommended that young children and their [[parent]]s be removed from these facilities to ensure their health and safety.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; However, it has been suggested that if the [[Australian Government]] grant children and their parents access into Australian communities without undergoing the same tests and detention period as other refugees and [[Refugee|asylum seekers]], then it will be assumed that anyone can [[Crime|illegally]] enter Australia with the [[guarantee]] that children and their parents will not have to endure the detention period.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; While it is not suggested that the health and safety of children is not of high importance, they have still entered the country illegally and are therefore need to undergo the same [[test (assessment)|tests]] and process period of all asylum seekers.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The issue of children in immigration detention facilities is of high importance and is therefore a controversial topic.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14823">'''Isomaltooligosaccharide''' ('''IMO''') is a mixture of short-chain [[carbohydrate]]s which has a digestion-resistant property. IMO is found naturally in some foods, as well as being manufactured commercially. The raw material used for manufacturing IMO is [[starch]], which is enzymatically converted into a mixture of isomaltooligosaccharides.

== Chemistry ==
The term "[[oligosaccharide]]" encompasses carbohydrates that are larger than simple di- or tri-[[saccharides]], but smaller than [[polysaccharides]] (greater than 10 units). Isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMO) are [[glucose]] oligomers with α-D-(1,6)-linkages, including [[isomaltose]], panose, isomaltotriose, isomaltotetraose, isomaltopentaose, [[nigerose]], [[kojibiose]], and higher branched oligosaccharides.&lt;ref&gt;PDRNS. 2001. Prebiotics. in: PDR for Nutritional Supplements (1st Ed.). Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR); Demoines, Iowa/Medical Economics Data Production Company; Montvale, New Jersey, pp. 372-375&lt;/ref&gt; While human intestinal enzymes readily digest α(1,4)-[[glycosidic bonds]], α(1,6)-linkages are not easily hydrolyzed and exhibit a digestion-resistant property. Therefore, IMO are only partially digested in the [[small intestine|upper gastrointestinal]] tract.

Isomalto-oligosaccharides are a normal part of the human diet and occur naturally in fermented foods, such as rice miso, soy sauce, and sake.&lt;ref&gt;Hondo, S. &amp; Mochizuki, T., Free Sugars in Miso. Nipon Shokuhin Kogyo Gakkaishi 26(11), (1979) 469-472&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nishino, R.; Ozawa, Y.; Yasuda, A.; Sakasai, T.  1981.  [Oligosaccharides in soy sauce].  Denpun Kagaku 28(2):125-131 [Japanese with English summary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tungland, B.C.; Meyer, D. 2002. Nondigestible oligo-and polysaccharides (dietary fiber): Their physiology and role in human health and food. Compr Rev Food Sci Food Safety 3:73-92&lt;/ref&gt; Isomaltose, one of the α(1,6)-linked disaccharide components of IMO, has been identified as a natural constituent of honey.&lt;ref&gt;White, J.W.; Hoban, N.  1959.  Composition of honey. IV. Identification of the disaccharides.  Arch Biochem Biophys 80(2):386-392&lt;/ref&gt; IMO is a sweet-tasting, high-density syrup which could be spray-dried into powder form.

==Manufacturing==
For manufacturing IMO on a commercial scale, food industries use [[starch]] processed from [[cereal]] crops like wheat, barley, [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]] (peas, beans, [[lentils]]), oats, [[tapioca]], rice, potato and others. This variety in sources could benefit consumers who have allergies or hypersensitivity to certain cereal crops. The manufacturing process controls the degree of polymerization (dp) and the α(1,6)-linkages to ensure a consistent quality of IMO from different starch sources. The starch is first converted, by means of simple enzymatic [[hydrolysis]], into high [[maltose]] syrup with di-, tri and oligosaccharides (2, 3 or more glucose units) having α(1,4)-glycosidic linkages which are readily digestible in the human intestine. These α(1,4)-glycosidic linkages are further converted into digestion-resistant α(1,6)-glycosidic linkages, creating "iso" linkages between glucose moieties and forming Isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMO).    
             
The majority of oligosaccharides found in IMO consist of three to six monosaccharide (glucose) units linked together. However, disaccharides, as well as longer polysaccharides (up to nine glucose units), are also present. The disaccharide fraction of IMO consists mainly of α(1,6)-linked [[isomaltose]], while [[maltotriose]], [[panose]], and isomaltotriose make up the trisaccharide fraction. A mixture of isomaltotetraose, isomaltopentaose, maltohexaose, maltoheptaose, and small amounts of oligomers with 8 or more degrees of polymerization, comprise the remaining oligomers in IMO. It should be noted that longer oligomers do not have 100% α(1,6)-linkages; the ratio of α(1,4)- to α(1,6)-linkages is variable.

==Health claims for oligosaccharides==
Health claims for the various classes of oligosaccharides have been investigated by the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) and found to be insufficiently substantiated. Therefore, health claims for oligosaccharides and prebiotics are prohibited in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;EU Register of nutrition and health claims made on foods, http://ec.europa.eu/nuhclaims/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health benefits==
IMO is a multifunctional molecule which exerts positive effects on human digestive health; it acts as a [[prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]], decreases flatulence, has a low glycemic index, and prevents dental caries.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Kaneko, T.; Kohmoto, T.; Fukui, F.; Akiba, T.; Suzuki, S.; Hirao, A.; Nakatsuru, S.; Kanisawa, M. 1990. [Acute and chronic toxicity and mutagenicity studies on isomaltooligosaccharides, and the effect on peripheral blood lymphocytes and intestinal microflora]. Shokuhin Eiseigaku Zasshi 31 (5):394-403 [Japanese with English summary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rycroft, C.E.; Jones, M.R.; Gibson, G.R.; Rastall, R.A. 2001. A comparative in vitro evaluation of the fermentation properties of prebiotic oligosaccharides. J Appl Microbiol 91(5):878-887&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesta, M., Debraekeleer,  J., Janssens, G. P. J. &amp; De Wilde, R. (2001) [The effect of a commercial high-fibre diet and an Isomalto-oligosaccharide-supplemented diet on post-prandial glucose concentrations in dogs] J. Animal Physio.

Shoni Shikagaku Zasshi 27(4) 1010-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Prebiotics are defined as "non-digestible food ingredients that may beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of a limited number of bacteria in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]".&lt;ref&gt;Roberfroid M., "Prebiotics: The Concept Revisited", J. Nutr. 137:830-837S, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Oligosaccharides that are not digested and absorbed in the small intestine, pass through to the colon where they are fermented by [[Bifidobacterium|Bifidobacteria]], thus enhancing the proliferation of the bacteria. In this respect, fermentable oligosaccharides may be considered [[prebiotics]]. The oligosaccharides in IMO mixtures are, at least partially, fermented by bacteria in the colon and may, therefore, stimulate  the growth of bacterial subpopulations.&lt;ref&gt;Ketabi, A., Dieleman, A. L., and Ganzle, G. M., 2011, [influence of isomaltooligosaccharides on intestinal microbiota in rats], J. Appl. Micro. Biol., 110, 1297-1306&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohmoto, T.; Fukui, F.; Takaku, H.; Machida, Y.; Arai, M.; Mitsuoka, T. 1988. Effect of isomalto-oligosaccharides on human fecal flora. Bifidobacteria [[Microflora]] 7(2):61-69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Qing, G.; Yi, Y.; Guohong, J.; Gai, C. 2003. [Study on the regulative effect of Isomaltooligosaccharides on human intestinal flora]. Wei Sheng Yan Jiu 32(1):54-55 [Chinese with English summary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Kaneko, T.; Komoto, T.; Kikuchi, H.; Shiota, M.; Yatake, T.; lino, H.; Tsuji, K. 1993.

(1994) [Effect of isomaltooligosaccharides with different degrees of polymerization on human fecal bifidobacteria] Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 58(12), 2288-2290&lt;/ref&gt;

Short chain oligosaccharides which confer prebiotic properties also produce short-chain fatty acids (like acetate, propionate and butyrate) as end-products of fermentation.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen, H.-L; Lu, Y.-H.; Lin, J.-J.; Ko, L.-Y. 2001. Effects of isomalto-oligosaccharides on bowel functions and indicators of nutritional status in constipated elderly men. J Am Coll Nutr 20(1):44-49&lt;/ref&gt; These molecules decrease the intra-luminal pH, directly inhibiting the growth and activity of harmful micro-organisms ([[Gastroenteritis|enteropathogens]]).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; This stimulates the growth of Bifidobacteria, which compete with the enteropathogens for nutrients and epithelial adhesion sites. The beneficial effects of IMO have been found in infants, children, and the elderly.

[[Dental caries]] is &lt;!-- "caries" is a mass noun and hence it is grammatically incorrect to say "caries are" --&gt;caused by the formation of insoluble [[glucan]] ([[Dental plaque|plaque]]) on the surface of teeth, and the production of acids by bacteria in the plaque. These acids attack the hard tissues of the teeth. Studies with animal models showed that IMO, in place of sucrose, reduces the amount of plaque formed and also reduces the amount of enamel-attacking acids formed. Therefore, IMO acts as an anti-caries agent&lt;ref&gt;Minami T, et al. (1989). Caries-inducing activity of isomaltooligosugar (IMOS) in vitro and rat experiments. Shoni Shikagaku Zasshi 27(4) 1010-7)&lt;/ref&gt;

The reported [[Glycemic Index]] (GI) for IMO is 34.66±7.65 (on a scale of 1–100) which represents a low GI.&lt;ref&gt;Sheng, G. E., Dong-lian, C. A. I. &amp; Wan, Li-li. (2006) [Determination of glycemic index of xylitol and isooligosccharide] Chin. J. Clin. Nutr., 14(4) 235-237&lt;/ref&gt; Consumption of IMO effectively improved bowel movements, stool output and microbial fermentation in the colon without any adverse effects in elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, H.-L., et al., 2001. Effects of isomalto-oligosaccharides on bowel functions and indicators of nutritional status in constipated elderly men. J Am Coll Nutr 20(1):44-49&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) defines soluble fiber as "the edible parts of plants or similar carbohydrates resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine with complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine".&lt;ref&gt;AACC Report, March 2001, Vol. 46, No. 3, page 112&lt;/ref&gt; Dietary fiber consists of many plant components including oligosaccharides. For a dietary substrate to be classified as a fiber, it must be resistant to digestion and absorption in upper GI tract, and cause a bulking effect in defecation. IMO is considered a dietary fiber for the following reasons: it consists of glucose units linked together (mostly) by digestion-resistant linkages; it has a prebiotic effect; it retains moisture, producing a bulking effect and helping to move the stool forward.&lt;ref&gt;Tungland, B.C.; Meyer, D. 2002. Nondigestible oligo-and polysaccharides (dietary fiber): Their physiology and role in human health and food. Compr. Rev. Food Sci. Food Safety 3:73-92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
IMO is finding global acceptance by food manufacturers for use in a wide range of food products, especially beverages and snack/nutrition bars. In the United States, IMO is used mostly as a source of dietary fiber. However, IMO is also used as a low calorie sweetener in a variety of foods like bakery and cereal products. Since IMO is about 50% as sweet as sucrose (sugar), it cannot replace sugar in a one-to-one ratio. However, IMO has few side effects compared to other oligosaccharides of the same class.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Oku, T.; Nakamura, S., 2002. Digestion, absorption, fermentation, and metabolism of functional sugar substitutes and their available energy. Pure Appl. Chem. 74(7): 1253-1261&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore this carbohydrate molecule is receiving growing attention by food manufacturers across North America, as well as in Europe.

==Side-effects==
Generally, all digestion-resistant oligosaccharides, including IMO, have adverse side effects when consumed in amounts greater than permissible levels. The maximum permissible dose of IMO is 1.5&amp;nbsp;g/kg body weight, which is higher than for any other sugar substitute.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; However, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has recommended a maximum consumption of  30&amp;nbsp;g/day for IMO.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bioneutra.ca/_pdf/FDA-GRAS_FullNotification_0209.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Higher dosages (greater than 40&amp;nbsp;g/day), can cause gastrointestinal symptoms like flatulence, [[bloating]], soft stool or [[diarrhea]].

==Regulatory information==
IMO and other oligosaccharides have long been approved in China and Japan. In Japan, IMO is on the list of Foods for Specified Health Use (FOSHU) for more than 10 years. In 2002, over 50% of the FOSHU foods in Japan incorporated oligosaccharides as the functional component.&lt;ref&gt;Nakakuki, T., (2003) Development of Functional Oligosaccharides in Japan. Trends in Glycoscience and Glycotechnology 15(82): 62 &amp; 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi, P. &amp; Associates, Inc. (2004) Functional Foods &amp; FOSHU Japan, Market &amp; Product Report&lt;/ref&gt; The list includes many types of foods: soft drinks and other beverages, frozen yogurt, confectionery products, sweeteners, cookies, coffee drink mixes, bread, tofu, chocolate, and soup mixes. IMO has been imported into the United States for the last few years but has never been manufactured there or formally approved by the FDA. In 2009, a Canadian-based company, [[BioNeutra]], received FDA-[[GRAS]] and [[Health Canada]] approval for IMO.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/GenerallyRecognizedasSafeGRAS/GRASListings/ucm154409.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Food Safety Agency]] (EFSA) recently authorized the sale of IMO in European countries.{{when|date=May 2016}}{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Commercial availability==
IMO is commercially manufactured mostly in China and Japan. However, most of this product is consumed locally or exported to neighboring Asian countries. In Japan, [[Meiji Dairies]] (Meiji Food Company) is one of the biggest IMO producers. IMO is marketed under several trade names like IMO-900 and IMO-800. Being a [[novel food]] ingredient, there wasn't a producer of IMO in North America and Europe until recently when BioNeutra North America, Inc. began to manufacture this product with the VitaFiber IMO trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioneutra.ca|title=BioNeutra: Producers of VitaFiber™IMO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; US-based companies have been in producing other kinds of oligosaccharides, like [[Galactooligosaccharides|GOS]], [[Fructooligosaccharide|FOS]], and [[Xylooligosaccharide|XOS]].

'''Jeffrey Kelly James''' (February 2, 1958 – [[circa|c.]] December 11, 2006) was one of three experienced mountain climbers who died on [[Mount Hood]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] in December 2006 in an incident which received worldwide attention.

James was a native of [[Dallas, Texas]] and a graduate of Texas Tech University in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]].  He was an accomplished landscape architect with his designs published in Metropolitan Home&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Home- Oct. 2005 
&lt;/ref&gt; and Better Homes and Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Better Homes and Gardens- September 2006
&lt;/ref&gt; James was also a veteran mountaineer with more than 25 years experience climbing mountains including [[Mount McKinley]], the [[Eiger]], [[Alpamayo]], and over 20 ascents of [[Mount Rainier]].&lt;ref name="HF" /&gt; James resided in Dallas with his wife Karen James and four children. 
He was also a devoted Christian.

On December 10, 2006, during his climb on Mount Hood, James made a cell phone call to his wife, Karen, and two older sons telling them that he was trapped in a [[snow cave]] and his two climbing partners Brian Hall and Jerry “Nikko” Cooke had gone for help. For more than a week, [[Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm of 2006|fierce weather]] thwarted rescue attempts. Finally on December 17, 2006, rescue workers located James’ body in a snow cave, 300 feet below the summit. Before he died of hypothermia, James removed his glove and extended his ring finger with his signet JKJ ring prominently displayed, which some have interpreted as a signal to his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3101">'''Kemron''' is the name of a drug which was released in [[Kenya]] in 1991 and purported to be highly effective in removing the symptoms of [[AIDS]].  When put under international scrutiny, the treatment was seen to perform no better than [[placebo]].  The advent of the drug was notable for the government support and international attention it received.

==Claim==
In August 1990, Kenyan researcher Davy Koech, director of the [[Kenya Medical Research Institute]], announced that when his HIV patients chewed wafers laced with tiny amounts of [[alpha interferon]], most had greatly improved health and some cleared HIV from their blood entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/03/world/in-kenya-a-new-aids-drug-gets-mired-in-politics-and-financial-disputes.html |title=In Kenya, a New AIDS Drug Gets Mired in Politics and Financial Disputes |first=Jane |last=Perlez |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 October 1990  |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The alpha interferon, named "Kemron" for this use, was a drug used to treat cancer in much greater doses.&lt;ref name="angry"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1993/01/03/the-angry-politics-of-kemron.html |title=The Angry Politics Of Kemron  |first=Mary |last=Hager |work=[[Newsweek]] |volume=121 |issue=1 |page=43 |date=3 January 1993 |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
After reviewing the experimental data, internationally recognized AIDS experts and health officials in the United States said that there was no merit to the claim.&lt;ref name="angry"/&gt;

Kenyan president [[Daniel arap Moi]] announced that "Fifty AIDS victims have already been cured" and Koech dismissed the skepticism of Western scientists.&lt;ref name="angry"/&gt; [[Barbara Justice]], a physician in [[New York City|New York]], claimed that 82% of AIDS patients at the Abundant Life clinic saw increases in their appetites and "other improvements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/04/us/aids-work-at-a-nation-of-islam-clinic-is-questioned.html|title = AIDS Work at a Nation of Islam Clinic Is Questioned|last =|first =|date = 4 March 1994|work = The New York Times|access-date = 17 May 2016|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the World Health Organization nor the NIH found evidence that Kemron performed better than placebo.&lt;ref name="angry"/&gt;

==Withdrawal of claim==
Support of the drug proved to be an embarrassment for many of its supporters as the drug failed to cure patients under controlled conditions.

The [[University of Pretoria]] and the [[Government of South Africa]] ultimately were not able to support the claim of the drug's efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thepharmaletter.com/file/50729/south-african-aids-cure-conjures-up-kemron-myth.html |title=South African AIDS 'Cure' Conjures Up Kemron Myth |first= |last= |work=thepharmaletter.com |date=17 February 1997 |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3153">[[File:Lithia Water 1888.jpg|thumb|Lithia Spring Water bottle, 1888]]
'''Lithia water''' is defined as a type of [[mineral water]] characterized by the presence of [[lithium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s (as [[lithium carbonate]]  or [[lithium chloride]]).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lithia%20water Lithia water]" Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Natural lithia mineral spring waters are rare and there are few commercially bottled lithia water products.

Between the 1880s and World War I, the consumption of bottled lithia mineral water was popular.&lt;ref&gt;Loring Bullard (2004) "Healing waters: Missouri's historic mineral springs and spas"&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first commercially sold lithia waters in the United States was bottled at [[Lithia Springs, Georgia]], in 1888.&lt;ref name="Davis, Fannie Mae Davis 1987"&gt;Davis, Fannie Mae Davis (1987). '' From Indian Trail to Interstate 20 '', Douglas County History book, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; During this era there was such a demand for lithia water that there was a proliferation of bottled lithia water products, however only a few were natural lithia spring waters. Most of the bottled lithia water brands added lithium bicarbonate to spring water and called it lithia water. With the advent of World War I and the formation of the new US government food safety agency, mineral water bottlers were under scrutiny. The new agency posted large fines against mineral water bottlers for mislabeled, misrepresented, and adulterated products.&lt;ref name="Vierville 1992"&gt;De Vierville (1992) "American Healing Waters"&lt;/ref&gt; These government actions and their publicity along with public works that made clean tap water readily accessible caused the American public to lose confidence and interest in bottled mineral water.&lt;ref name="Vierville 1992"/&gt;

Lithia water contains various lithium salts, including the citrate. An early version of [[Coca-Cola]] available in pharmacies' soda fountains called Lithia Coke was a mixture of Coca-Cola syrup and lithia water. The [[soft drink]] [[7_Up#History|7Up]] was originally named "Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda" when it was formulated in 1929 because it contained [[lithium citrate]]. The beverage was a [[patent medicine]] marketed as a cure for [[hangover]]. Lithium citrate was removed from 7Up in 1948.&lt;ref name="gielen 3"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Gielen | first = Marcel | authorlink =  | author2 = Edward R. T.

      <comment>Specifying "causes *of mental illness*" ("cause of mental health," which was implied by the previous wording, doesn't make much sense.)</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11053">[[Mental health]] in [[aviation]] is a major concern among [[airline]]s, regulators, and [[passenger]]s. This topic gained more attention after the [[Germanwings Flight 9525|2015 Germanwings crash]], which was deliberately caused by the plane's copilot.  There are many different [[cause]]s of mental illness in pilots but, as of now, there is almost no action taken to try and combat this issue. Little [[data]] exists on mental health in aviation, but steps to gather relevant information and provide better solutions are underway.  [[File:Airbus-319-cockpit-2-rr.jpg|thumb|The life of an [[Pilot (aeronautics)|airline pilot]] is very stressful and demanding. Following recent events, mental health in aviation is gaining attention within the aviation industry.]]

== Prevalence of disorders ==
In [[Brazil|Brazil's]] [[General aviation|General Aviation]] sector, 10.2% of [[Pilot (aeronautics)|pilots]] who did not exercise regularly and 23.7% of pilots who have a heavy workload, showed signs of common mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feijó|first1=Denise|last2=Luiz|first2=Ronir Raggio|last3=Camara|first3=Volney Magalhães|title=Common Mental Disorders Among Civil Aviation Pilots|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|date=May 2012|volume=83|issue=5|pages=509–513|doi=10.3357/asem.3185.2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is commonly believed by the public that pilots are perfect; however this is not the case.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Mental health problems are present in aviation, just like in any other industry, and more must be done to seek this out, both during the career of a pilot and at the hiring stages. It is important to have a wide variety of tests and screening processes to determine the true wellness of pilots.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butcher|first1=James|title=Assessing Pilots with ‘the Wrong Stuff’: A Call for Research on Emotional Health Factors in Commercial Aviators|journal=International Journal of Selection and Assessment|date=March 2002|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=168–184|doi=10.1111/1468-2389.00204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], it was revealed that 350 pilots have been grounded since 2010 due to mental health issues.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3176861/Review-British-pilots-mental-health-wake-Germanwings-disaster-finds-350-grounded-past-five-years-276-returned-skies.html|title = 350 British pilots grounded in the past five years because of mental illness, figures released after Germanwings crash show|last = Matthew|first = Sam|date = 29 July 2015|work = |access-date = |via = |publisher = Daily Mail UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2015}}

Mental illness is second to cardiovascular disease in reasons for losing an aviation license.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One major issue is that most pilots on anti-depressant drugs, for example, withhold this information from their doctor or the governing body of aviation in their country due to fear of losing their license.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bor|first1=Robert|title=Psychological factors in airline passenger and crew behaviour: A clinical overview|journal=Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease|date=July 2007|volume=5|issue=4|pages=207–216|doi=10.1016/j.tmaid.2007.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Detection is further complicated by the fact that few [[Aviation medical examiner|medical examiners]] fully understand the complexity and effects of the different disorders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, psychiatrists are unfamiliar with the regulations of pilots suffering from mental health issues.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Even though pilots need to have their medical license renewed every 6 months by a certified medical examiner, there is little focus on mental health and no [[psychologist]] or [[psychiatrist]] follows up unless requested to do so by the pilot, which is rarely the case.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vuorio|first1=Alpo|last2=Laukkala|first2=Tanja|last3=Navathe|first3=Pooshan|title=Major Depression and Fitness to Fly by Different Aviation Authorities|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|date=September 2012|volume=83|issue=9|pages=909–911|doi=10.3357/asem.3363.2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Airline]]s are familiar with the consequences of [[mental health]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which is why they administer personality tests during the selection process in order to identify any mental health issues. One example is the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)]]. This long questionnaire can identify any at risk candidates, by asking a series of questions, worded differently, all around a similar subject.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pilots are aware of the importance of having perfect mental health. As a result, the pilots tended to be extremely defensive in their results, even more so then the average population, trying to show no signs of any mental health issues.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butcher|first1=James|title=Psychological Assessment of Airline Pilot Applicants With the MMPI-2|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|date=1994|volume=62|issue=1|pages=31–44|doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa6201_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
During the course of a pilot's career, the prominence of mental health becomes an even bigger issue as the stresses of the occupation accumulate.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Pilots are exposed to difficult working conditions that feature inconsistent schedules, extended periods away from home, and frequent encounters with [[Pilot fatigue|fatigue]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bor|first1=Robert|last2=Field|first2=Gaby|last3=Scragg|first3=Peter|title=The mental health of pilots: An overview|journal=Counselling Psychology Quarterly|date=2002|volume=15|issue=3|pages=239–256|doi=10.1080/09515070210143471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental health is amplified by the lack of social support from home, a varying circadian rhythm, and the excessive job demands.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Experts and airlines have been aware of these issues from as early as 1985, yet very little information about mental health in aviation exists.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Cary|last2=Sloan|first2=Stephen|title=Occupational and Psychosocial Stress Among Commercial Aviation Pilots.|journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine|date=August 1985|volume=27|issue=8|pages=570–575|doi=10.1097/00043764-198508000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a macho attitude towards mental health in aviation, with a laissez-faire approach.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Both males and females are susceptible to mental health issues, however there is no greater likelihood that one gender will face more issues than the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walton|first1=Robert|last2=Politano|first2=Michael|title=Gender-related perceptions and stress, anxiety, and depression on the flight deck.|journal=Aviation Psychology and Applied Human Factors|date=2014|volume=4|issue=2|pages=67–73|doi=10.1027/2192-0923/a000058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a negative [[Social stigma|stigma]] around mental health in aviation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A study showed that fellow pilots assumed fellow pilots who were unsociable most likely have a mental health illness.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winter|first1=Scott|last2=Rice|first2=Stephen|title=Pilots Who Are Perceived as Unsociable Are Perceived as More Likely to Have a Mental Illness|journal=Aviation Psychology and Applied Human Factors|date=December 18, 2014|volume=5|issue=1|pages=36–44|doi=10.1027/2192-0923/a000071}}&lt;/ref&gt; This identifies that even factors that are not signs of mental health can stigmatize others and the negative consequences of being identified as having mental health issues, even when this is not the case.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Solutions ==
Pilots and their employers must also be aware of recent life changes that may affect pilot performance and mental health characteristics. One such way is the Recent Life Change Questionnaire, which measures how susceptible someone is to change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This questionnaire identifies certain individuals who are more at risk of mental health issues and allows the airline to then provide support for them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is crucial for airlines to develop a program to remove individuals who are in a high risk state and help them transition to a more suitable job.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haakonson|first1=NH|title=Investigation of life changes as a contributing factor in aircraft accidents: a prospectus|journal=Aviat Space Environ Med|date=Sep 1980|volume=51|issue=9PT2|pages=981–988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Regulators are also considering implementing random psychological screenings to pilots, however it has been suggested that this will not be foolproof in eliminating mental health issues within pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bryan|first1=Victoria|title=Airline industry battles with pilot mental health options after Germanwings|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/09/us-airlines-iata-germanwings-pilots-idUSKBN0OP28020150609|publisher=Reuteurs|date=Jun 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] also announced that it will conduct research into newer and more relevant data concerning mental health within pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sifferlin|first1=Alexandra|title=FAA Will Study Pilots’ Mental Health|url=http://time.com/3898396/federal-aviation-administration-pilots-mental-health/|publisher=Time|date=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is equally important for pilots to feel open about their mental health and not be afraid of losing their career. This can be accomplished by removing the stigma associated with mental health, encourage self-reporting, and having companies work with pilots to help them find other aviation jobs and provide wellness centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patton|first1=John|title=Human Resource Management (HRM) in the Aviation Industry|journal=The Journal of Global Business Management Volume|date=April 2015|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the hiring phase, pilots can be administered different personality tests to see if they are at risk of mental health issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Following the [[Germanwings Flight 9525]], both the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] and the Civil Aviation Medical Association are looking into solutions, one being random psychological tests. The issue with a reactive instead of proactive method, is that rather than supporting pilots, it creates an even bigger stigma within the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Airline industry battles with pilot mental health options after Germanwings|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/09/us-airlines-iata-germanwings-pilots-idUSKBN0OP28020150609|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2015-06-09|access-date = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Aviation Safety Agency also issued a similar statement, stating all pilots need to undergo psychological evaluation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Nursing is a licensed profession in the [[Republic of China]], plus additional of further nurse specialist training courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mohw.gov.tw/EN/Ministry/Index.aspx Ministry of Health and Welfare衛福部]&lt;/ref&gt; Health law and regulation in [[Taiwan]] is overseen by the [[Ministry of Health and Welfare (Taiwan)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]].

== Nursing education ==

Taiwanese nurses are segregated into three categories based on length of training, comparable to the licensed, registered, and advanced registered categories in the [[Nursing in the United States|American system]]. Speciality nurses (專科學校) study for 5–7 years, normal nurses (普通大學) for 4, and inaugural nurses (在職專班) for two.

Upon the cessation of training, nurses must pass an exam to be certified. After two years of practice, nurses may undergo further education in a speciality such as [[anaesthesia]] or [[Burn|burn care]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnpa.org.tw/en/ Taiwan Association of Nurse Practitioner] 台灣專科護理協會&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nurse practitioners===
In Taiwan there are NP courses: emergency care, midwifery care, oncological care, orthopedic care, pediatric care, anesthesia care, outpatient care.

=== Education organization ===

'''"Open Country"''' is a designation used for some UK access land. 

It was first defined under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]] (and extended by the [[Countryside Act 1968]]), and was land over which an appropriate access agreement had been made. In particular significant upland areas of the northern [[Peak District]], where there had been much dispute over access prior to [[World War II]], were so designated (see ''[[Mass trespass of Kinder Scout]]'').

The term is also used in the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] to describe 'areas of mountain, moor, heath and down' that are generally available for access under that Act. (It appears that the rights conferred by this new definition are in general less comprehensive than those conferred under the 1949 Act, but will apply to a wider area.)

The [[Countryside Agency]]'s publication ''Managing Public Access'' appears to envisage that most land originally designated under the 1949 Act will in due course receive redesignation under the CRoW Act, as the original access agreements lapse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naturalengland.communisis.com/naturalenglandshop/docs/CA210.pdf Natural England website: Managing Public Access]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oxford Tobacco Research Station''' is a [[government agency]] conducting [[research]] on [[flue-cured tobacco]] and other [[crops]]. It is located in [[Oxford, North Carolina]] and has existed since 1911. Superintendents since 1911 have been Moss, Carr, Ayscue, Campbell, Clements, Priest and Smith. Much has been accomplished related to disease resistance and tobacco curing. Forestry, wildlife habitat and water quality studies were started during the 80's.

== Context for the passage of the Act ==

The [[Notice of proposed rulemaking]]&lt;ref name="nprm"&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2008/pdf/E8-2375.pdf Patient Safety and Quality Improvement — Proposed Rule, Federal Register February 12, 2008, pages 8112–8183.]&lt;/ref&gt; for this law describes the reason Congress passed it.

{{quote|Much of the impetus for this legislation can be traced to the publication of the landmark report, "[[To Err is Human]]",&lt;ref name="toerr"&gt;{{Cite book| isbn = 978-0-309-06837-6| editor-last = Kohn| editor-first = Linda T.| editor2-last = Corrigan| editor2-first = Janet M.| editor3-last = Donaldson| editor3-first = Molla S.| title = To Err is Human—Building a Safer Health System| publisher = [[National Academies Press]]| year = 2000| location = Washington, D. C.| pages = 312| url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=9728}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Institute of Medicine]] in 1999 (Report). The Report cited studies that found that at least 44,000 people and potentially as many as 98,000 people die in U. S. hospitals each year as a result of preventable [[medical error]]s. Based on these studies and others, the Report estimated that the total national costs of preventable [[adverse event]]s, including lost income, lost household productivity, permanent and temporary disability, and health care costs to be between $17 billion and $29 billion, of which health care costs represent one-half. One of the main conclusions was that the majority of medical errors do not result from individual [[Recklessness (law)|recklessness]] or the actions of a particular group; rather, most errors are caused by faulty systems, processes, and conditions that lead people to make mistakes or fail to prevent adverse events. Thus, the Report recommended mistakes can best be prevented by designing the health care system at all levels to improve safety—making it harder to do something wrong and easier to do something right.

As compared to other high-risk industries, the [[Health care system#United States|health care system]] is behind in its attention to ensuring basic safety. The reasons for this lag are complex and varied. Providers are often reluctant to participate in quality review activities for fear of liability, professional sanctions, or injury to their reputations. Traditional state-based legal protections for such health care quality improvement activities, collectively known as [[Medical peer review|peer review]] protections, are limited in scope: They do not exist in all States; typically they only apply to peer review in hospitals and do not cover other health care settings, and seldom enable health care systems to pool data or share experience between facilities. If peer review protected information is transmitted outside an individual hospital, the peer review privilege for that information is generally considered to be waived. This limits the potential for aggregation of a sufficient number of patient safety events to permit the identification of patterns that could suggest the underlying causes of risks and hazards that then can be used to improve patient safety.}}

== Summary of the act's major sections&lt;ref name="theact" /&gt; ==

=== Definitions ===

''Patient Safety Organization'' (PSO) must certify that it supports the requirements in the PSQIA and be [http://www.pso.ahrq.gov/listing/psolist.htm listed] on the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) web site.

The definition of ''Patient Safety Work Product'' (PSWP) is quite broad. Patient safety work product includes any data, reports, records, memoranda, analyses (such as [[root cause analysis|root cause analyses]]), or written or oral statements (or copies of any of this material), which could improve patient safety, health care quality, or health care outcomes, that are assembled or developed by a provider for reporting to a PSO and are reported to a PSO. It also includes information that is documented as within a patient safety evaluation system that will be sent to a PSO and information developed by a PSO for the conduct of patient safety activities.

However, patient safety work product does not include a patient's [[medical record]], billing and discharge information, or any other original patient or provider information; nor does it include information that is collected, maintained, or developed separately, or exists separately, from a patient safety evaluation system.

=== Privilege and confidentiality protections ===

Patient Safety Work Product must not be disclosed, except in very specific circumstances and subject to very specific restrictions.

Note: the Patient Safety Activities Exception is the most common one that providers and PSOs will be working with.

Permitted Disclosures

* Patient Safety Activities — PSWP may be disclosed:
** Between the Provider and the PSO — i.e.:
*** From the provider to the PSO, for Patient Safety Activities, and
*** From the PSO to the disclosing provider, for Patient Safety Activities
** To a contractor of a Provider or a PSO
*** For contracted Patient Safety Activities
*** Contractor may not further disclose, except back to the contracted provider or PSO
** Among affiliated providers, for Patient Safety Activities
*** From one PSO to another PSO or another provider, if
**** Direct identifiers (which are defined in the regulations) of any providers, affiliated organizations, corporate parents, subsidiaries, practice partners, employers, members of the workforce, or household members of such providers are removed; and
**** With respect to any Individually identifiable health information within the PSWP, a limited data set (also defined by regulation) is produced
* Business operations — A provider or PSO may disclose to attorneys, accountants or other professionals for business operations purposes.
** Further disclosure (except back to the contracting entity) is prohibited
* Authorized by identified providers — Disclosure is permitted if all identified providers authorize the disclosure.
** Authorization must be in writing, signed by the provider, and
** Must state the nature and scope of the disclosure
* Accrediting bodies (e.g., [[Joint Commission|The Joint Commission]]) — PSWP may be (but is not required to be) disclosed to an accrediting body if:
** Any identified provider agrees to the disclosure; or
** Direct identifiers of any provider (or affiliated organizations, corporate parents, subsidiaries, practice partners, employers, members of the workforce, or household members) are removed
* Nonidentifiable PSWP — May be disclosed
** The regulations set out specific requirements for "nonidentification."
* Research — This exception allows disclosure to researchers conducting certain types of research projects. If protected health information is involved, the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] privacy and security rules also apply.
* [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) — PSWP may be disclosed to the FDA
** By a provider concerning an FDA-regulated product or activity,
** By an entity required to report to the FDA about the quality, safety, or effectiveness of an FDA-regulated product or activity, or
** By a contractor acting on behalf of the FDA or entity for these purposes
* Law enforcement — PSWP may be disclosed to law enforcement personnel
** If the information relates to an event that either constitutes the commission of a crime, or for which the disclosing person reasonably believes constitutes the commission of a crime, provided that the disclosing person believes, reasonably under the circumstances, that the patient safety work product that is disclosed is necessary for criminal law enforcement purposes
* Criminal proceedings — But only after a court makes an ''[[in camera]]'' (in closed chambers) determination that:
** The PSWP contains evidence of a criminal act;
** The PSWP is material to the proceedings; and
** The PSWP is not reasonably available from any other source
* Disclosure to permit equitable relief for reporting individuals — This exception allows use of PSWP by individuals who claim they have been the victim of an adverse employment action because the individual reported information to a PSO (either directly to the PSO or with the intent of having it reported to the PSO)
** There must be a "protective order" issued by the court or administrative tribunal to protect the confidentiality of PSWP used in the proceeding

Violations &amp; Enforcement

* An individual who knowingly or recklessly violates the confidentiality provisions is subject to a [[civil penalty]] of up to $10,000 for each act constituting such violation.
* [[Safe harbor (law)|Safe Harbor]] — a provider whose workforce member discloses PSWP is not deemed to have violated the Act if that workforce member disclosure does not include written or oral statements that:

'''Pharmacogenomics''' is the study of the role of the [[genome]] in [[drug]] response. Its name (''[[wikt:pharmaco-#Prefix|pharmaco-]]'' + ''[[genomics]]'') reflects its combining of [[pharmacology]] and [[genomics]]. Pharmacogenomics analyzes how the genetic makeup of an individual affects his/her response to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emerging Medical Technologies|last=Ermak|first=Gennady|publisher=World Scientific|year=2015|isbn=978-981-4675-80-2|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with the influence of acquired and inherited [[genetics|genetic]] variation on drug response in patients by correlating [[gene expression]] or [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s with [[pharmacokinetics]] (drug [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]], [[distribution (pharmacology)|distribution]], [[metabolism]], and [[Clearance (medicine)|elimination]]) and [[pharmacodynamics]] (effects mediated through a drug's [[biological target]]s).&lt;ref name="pmid14585618"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Johnson JA | title = Pharmacogenetics: potential for individualized drug therapy through genetics. | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 19 | issue = 11 | pages = 660–6 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14585618 | doi=10.1016/j.tig.2003.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNC Center for Pharmacogenomics and Individualized Therapy"&gt;{{cite web| title= Center for Pharmacogenomics and Individualized Therapy| url=https://pharmacy.unc.edu/research/centers/cpit/| accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=overview of pharmacogenomics|publisher= Up-to-Date| url =http://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics?source=search_result&amp;search=pharmacogenomics&amp;selectedTitle=1~15|date=May 16, 2014|accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''pharmacogenomics'' is often used interchangeably with ''[[pharmacogenetics]]''. Although both terms relate to drug response based on genetic influences, pharmacogenetics focuses on single drug-[[gene]] interactions, while pharmacogenomics encompasses a more genome-wide association approach, incorporating genomics and [[epigenetics]] while dealing with the effects of multiple genes on drug response.&lt;ref name="pmid19565025"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sheffield LJ, Phillimore HE | title = Clinical use of pharmacogenomic tests in 2009 | journal = Clin Biochem Rev | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 55–65 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19565025 | pmc = 2702214 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19299369"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shin J, Kayser SR, Langaee TY | title = Pharmacogenetics: from discovery to patient care. | journal = Am J Health Syst Pharm | volume = 66 | issue = 7 | pages = 625–37 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19299369 | doi=10.2146/ajhp080170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Factsheet."&gt;{{cite web| title= Center for Genetics Education| url=http://www.genetics.edu.au/Publications-and-Resources/Genetics-Fact-Sheets/pharmacogenetics-pharmacogenomics=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmacogenomics aims to develop rational means to optimize [[pharmacotherapy|drug therapy]], with respect to the patients' [[genotype]], to ensure maximum efficiency with minimal [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]].&lt;ref name="pmid19530963"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becquemont L | title = Pharmacogenomics of adverse drug reactions: practical applications and perspectives | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 961–9 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19530963 | doi = 10.2217/pgs.09.37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the utilization of pharmacogenomics, it is hoped that [[pharmaceutical drug]] treatments can deviate from what is dubbed as the "one-dose-fits-all" approach. Pharmacogenomics also attempts to eliminate the trial-and-error method of prescribing, allowing physicians to take into consideration their patient's genes, the functionality of these genes, and how this may affect the efficacy of the patient's current or future treatments (and where applicable, provide an explanation for the failure of past treatments).&lt;ref name="pmid19565025"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hauser AS, Chavali S, Masuho I, Jahn LJ, Martemyanov KA, Gloriam DE, Babu MM | title = Pharmacogenomics of GPCR Drug Targets | journal = Cell | volume = 172 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 41–54.e19 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29249361 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2017.11.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such approaches promise the advent of [[precision medicine]] and even [[personalized medicine]], in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for narrow subsets of patients or even for each individual's unique genetic makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126957.pdf|format=PDF|title=Guidance for Industry Pharmacogenomic Data Submissions|date=March 2005|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|access-date=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20712531"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Squassina A, Manchia M, Manolopoulos VG, Artac M, Lappa-Manakou C, Karkabouna S, Mitropoulos K, Del Zompo M, Patrinos GP | title = Realities and expectations of pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine: impact of translating genetic knowledge into clinical practice | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 1149–67 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20712531 | doi = 10.2217/pgs.10.97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether used to explain a patient's response or lack thereof to a treatment, or act as a predictive tool, it hopes to achieve better treatment outcomes, greater efficacy, minimization of the occurrence of drug toxicities and adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

In order to provide pharmacogenomic recommendations for a given drug, two possible types of input can be used: [[genotyping]] or [[exome]] or whole [[genome]] [[sequencing]].&lt;ref name=eval&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huser V, Cimino JJ | title = Providing pharmacogenomics clinical decision support using whole genome sequencing data as input | journal = AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science Proceedings.

== History ==

Pharmacogenomics was first recognized by [[Pythagoras]] around 510 BC when he made a connection between the dangers of fava bean ingestion with hemolytic anemia and oxidative stress. This identification was later validated and attributed to deficiency of [[G6PD]] in the 1950s and called [[favism]].&lt;ref name="pmid11678777"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22461095"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prasad K | title = Role of regulatory agencies in translating pharmacogenetics to the clinics | journal = Clin Cases Miner Bone Metab | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–34 | year = 2009 | pmid = 22461095 | pmc = 2781218 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the first official publication dates back to 1961,&lt;ref name="Evans_1961"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Evans DA, Clarke CA | title = Pharmacogenetics | journal = Br Med Bull | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 234–40 | year = 1961 | pmid = 13697554 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; circa 1950s marked the unofficial beginnings of this science. Reports of prolonged paralysis and fatal reactions linked to genetic variants in patients who lacked butyryl-cholinesterase (‘pseudocholinesterase’) following administration of succinylcholine injection during anesthesia were first reported in 1956.&lt;ref name="pmid14585618"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16415920"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalow W | title = Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics: origin, status, and the hope for personalized medicine | journal = Pharmacogenomics J | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 162–5 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16415920 | doi = 10.1038/sj.tpj.6500361 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term pharmacogenetic was first coined in 1959 by Friedrich Vogel of Heidelberg, Germany (although some papers suggest it was 1957 or 1958).&lt;ref&gt;Vogel F. Moderne Probleme der Humangenetik. Ergeb Inn Med Kinderheilk 1959; 12: 52–125&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, twin studies supported the inference of genetic involvement in drug metabolism, with identical twins sharing remarkable similarities to drug response compared to fraternal twins.&lt;ref name="pmid16421980"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Motulsky AG, Qi M | title = Pharmacogenetics, pharmacogenomics and ecogenetics | journal = J Zhejiang Univ Sci B | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–70 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16421980 | pmc = 1363768 | doi = 10.1631/jzus.2006.B0169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term pharmacogenomics first began appearing around the 1990s.&lt;ref name="pmid11678777"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pirmohamed M | title = Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics | journal = Br J Clin Pharmacol | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 345–7 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11678777 | pmc = 2014592 | doi = 10.1046/j.0306-5251.2001.01498.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first FDA approval of a pharmacogenetic test was in 2005&lt;ref name=Squassina2010&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/727112_7 Realities and Expectations of Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine: Impact of Translating Genetic Knowledge into Clinical Practice. 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; (for alleles in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19).

== Drug-metabolizing enzymes  ==

There are several known genes which are largely responsible for variances in drug metabolism and response. The focus of this article will remain on the genes that are more widely accepted and utilized clinically for brevity.

* Cytochrome P450s
* VKORC1
* TPMT

=== Cytochrome P450 ===

The most prevalent drug-metabolizing enzymes (DME) are the [[Cytochrome P450]] (CYP) enzymes. The term Cytochrome P450 was coined by Omura and Sato in 1962 to describe the membrane-bound, heme-containing protein characterized by 450&amp;nbsp;nm spectral peak when complexed with [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref name="pmid17276348"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Debose-Boyd RA | title = A helping hand for cytochrome p450 enzymes | journal = Cell Metab | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–3 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17276348 | doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2007.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human CYP family consists of 57 genes, with 18 families and 44 subfamilies. CYP proteins are conveniently arranged into these families and subfamilies on the basis of similarities identified between the amino acid sequences. Enzymes that share 35-40% identity are assigned to the same family by an [[Arabic numeral]], and those that share 55-70% make up a particular subfamily with a designated letter.&lt;ref name="pmid12387968 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nebert DW, Russell DW | title = Clinical importance of the cytochromes P450 | journal = Lancet | volume = 360 | issue = 9340 | pages = 1155–62 | date = October 12, 2002 | pmid = 12387968 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(02)11203-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[CYP2D6]] refers to family 2, subfamily D, and gene number 6.

From a clinical perspective, the most commonly tested CYPs include: [[CYP2D6]], [[CYP2C19]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP3A5]]. These genes account for the metabolism of approximately 80-90% of currently available prescription drugs.&lt;ref name="pmid18216718"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hart SN, Wang S, Nakamoto K, Wesselman C, Li Y, Zhong XB | title = Genetic polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase influence microsomal P450-catalyzed drug metabolism | journal = Pharmacogenet Genomics | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–24 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18216718 | doi = 10.1097/FPC.0b013e3282f2f121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19374516"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gomes AM, Winter S, Klein K, Turpeinen M, Schaeffeler E, Schwab M, Zanger UM | title = Pharmacogenomics of human liver cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase: multifactorial analysis and impact on microsomal drug oxidation | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 579–99 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19374516 | doi = 10.2217/pgs.09.7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below provides a summary for some of the medications that take these pathways.

====CYP2D6====

Also known as [[debrisoquine]] hydroxylase (named after the drug that led to its discovery), [[CYP2D6]] is the most well-known and extensively studied CYP gene.&lt;ref name="badyal"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Badyal DK, Dadhich AP | title = Cytochrome P450 and drug interactions | journal = Indian Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 33 | pages = 248–259 |date=October 2001 | url=http://medind.nic.in/ibi/t01/i4/ibit01i4p248.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a gene of great interest also due to its highly [[Gene polymorphism|polymorphic]] nature, and involvement in a high number of medication metabolisms (both as a major and minor pathway). More than 100 CYP2D6 genetic variants have been identified.&lt;ref name="pmid15063083 "/&gt;

====CYP2C19====

Discovered in the early 1980s, [[CYP2C19]] is the second most extensively studied and well understood gene in pharmacogenomics.&lt;ref name="pmid10575648"/&gt; Over 28 genetic variants have been identified for CYP2C19,&lt;ref name="humanCYPdb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/ |title=The Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Database | vauthors = Ingelman-Sundberg M, Nebert DW, Sim SC | access-date=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which affects the metabolism of several classes of drugs, such as [[antidepressants]] and [[proton pump inhibitors]].&lt;ref name="pmid18001838 "&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ingelman-Sundberg M, Sim SC, Gomez A, Rodriguez-Antona C | title = Influence of cytochrome P450 polymorphisms on drug therapies: pharmacogenetic, pharmacoepigenetic and clinical aspects | journal = Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | volume = 116 | issue = 3 | pages = 496–526 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18001838 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2007.09.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CYP2C9 ====

[[CYP2C9]] constitutes the majority of the CYP2C subfamily, representing approximately 20% of the liver content. It is involved in the metabolism of approximately 10% of all drugs, which include medications with narrow therapeutic windows such as [[warfarin]] and [[tolbutamide]].&lt;ref name="pmid18001838 "/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16282513 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sikka R, Magauran B, Ulrich A, Shannon M | title = Bench to bedside: Pharmacogenomics, adverse drug interactions, and the cytochrome P450 system | journal = Acad Emerg Med | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = 1227–35 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16282513 | doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.2005.tb01503.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 57 genetic variants associated with CYP2C9.&lt;ref name="humanCYPdb"/&gt;

==== CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 ====

The CYP3A family is the most abundantly found in the liver, with [[CYP3A4]] accounting for 29% of the liver content.&lt;ref name="pmid10575648"/&gt; These enzymes also cover between 40-50% of the current prescription drugs, with the CYP3A4 accounting for 40-45% of these medications.&lt;ref name="pmid22461095"/&gt; [[CYP3A5]] has over 11 genetic variants identified at the time of this publication.&lt;ref name="humanCYPdb"/&gt;

=== VKORC1 ===

The vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 ([[VKORC1]]) is responsible for the pharmacodynamics of warfarin.&lt;ref name="pmid21507031"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Teh LK, Langmia IM, Fazleen Haslinda MH, Ngow HA, Roziah MJ, Harun R, Zakaria ZA, Salleh MZ | title = Clinical relevance of VKORC1 (G-1639A and C1173T) and CYP2C9*3 among patients on warfarin | journal = J Clin Pharm Ther | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 232–6 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 21507031 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2710.2011.01262.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; VKORC1 along with CYP2C9 are useful for identifying the risk of bleeding during warfarin administration. Warfarin works by inhibiting VKOR, which is encoded by the VKORC1 gene. Individuals with polymorphism in this have an affected response to warfarin treatment.&lt;ref name="tableFDA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/drugs/scienceresearch/researchareas/pharmacogenetics/ucm083378.htm |title=Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labels. |author=U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)| accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TPMT===

[[Thiopurine methyltransferase]] (TPMT) catalyzes the S-methylation of thiopurines, thereby regulating the balance between cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide and inactive metabolites in hematopoietic cells.&lt;ref name="pmid22948889 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crews KR, Hicks JK, Pui CH, Relling MV, Evans WE | title = Pharmacogenomics and individualized medicine: translating science into practice | journal = Clin Pharmacol Ther | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 467–75 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22948889 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.2012.120 | pmc=3589526}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TPMT is highly involved in 6-MP metabolism and TMPT activity and TPMT genotype is known to affect the risk of toxicity. Excessive levels of 6-MP can cause myelosuppression and myelotoxicity.&lt;ref name="pmid23089672 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sim SC, Kacevska M, Ingelman-Sundberg M | title = Pharmacogenomics of drug-metabolizing enzymes: a recent update on clinical implications and endogenous effects | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23089672 | doi = 10.1038/tpj.2012.45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Codeine]], [[clopidogrel]], [[tamoxifen]], and [[warfarin]] a few examples of medications that follow the above metabolic pathways.

== {{anchor|Predictive prescribing}} Predictive prescribing == &lt;!-- Several redirects lead here --&gt;

Patient genotypes are usually categorized into the following predicted phenotypes:

* Ultra-rapid metabolizer: patients with substantially increased metabolic activity;
* Extensive metabolizer: normal metabolic activity;
* Intermediate metabolizer: patients with reduced metabolic activity; and
* Poor metabolizer: patients with little to no functional metabolic activity.

The two extremes of this spectrum are the poor metabolizers and ultra-rapid metabolizers. Efficacy of a medication is not only based on the above metabolic statuses, but also the type of drug consumed. Drugs can be classified into two main groups: active drugs and prodrugs. Active drugs refer to drugs that are inactivated during metabolism, and prodrugs are inactive until they are metabolized.

[[File:Intermediate Metabolizer Genotype to Reporting Process Example.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3| An overall process of how pharmacogenomics functions in a clinical practice. From the raw genotype results, this is then translated to the physical trait, the phenotype. Based on these observations, optimal dosing is evaluated.&lt;ref name="pmid22948889 "/&gt;]]

For example, we have two patients who are taking codeine for pain relief. Codeine is a prodrug, so it requires conversion from its inactive form to its active form. The active form of codeine is morphine, which provides the therapeutic effect of pain relief. If person A receives one *1 allele each from mother and father to code for the CYP2D6 gene, then that person is considered to have an extensive metabolizer (EM) phenotype, as allele *1 is considered to have a normal-function (this would be represented as CYP2D6 *1/*1). If person B on the other hand had received one *1 allele from the mother and a *4 allele from the father, that individual would be an Intermediate Metabolizer (IM) (the genotype would be CYP2D6 *1/*4). Although both individuals are taking the same dose of codeine, person B could potentially lack the therapeutic benefits of codeine due to the decreased conversion rate of codeine to its active counterpart morphine.

Each phenotype is based upon the allelic variation within the individual genotype. However, several genetic events can influence a same phenotypic trait, and establishing genotype-to-phenotype relationships can thus be far from consensual with many enzymatic patterns. For instance, the influence of the CYP2D6*1/*4 allelic variant on the clinical outcome in patients treated with Tamoxifen remains debated today. In oncology, genes coding for [[Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency|DPD]], [[UGT1A1]], [[Thiopurine methyltransferase|TPMT]], [[Cytidine deaminase|CDA]] involved in the pharmacokinetics of [[5-FU]]/[[capecitabine]], [[irinotecan]], [[6-mercaptopurine]] and [[gemcitabine]]/[[cytarabine]], respectively, have all been described as being highly polymorphic. A strong body of evidence suggests that patients affected by these genetic polymorphisms will experience severe/lethal toxicities upon drug intake, and that pre-therapeutic screening does help to reduce the risk of treatment-related toxicities through adaptive dosing strategies.&lt;ref name="pmid20818641"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee SY, McLeod HL | title = Pharmacogenetic tests in cancer chemotherapy: what physicians should know for clinical application | journal = J Pathol | volume = 223 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–27 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20818641 | doi = 10.1002/path.2766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

The list below provides a few more commonly known applications of pharmacogenomics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Nadine |date=November 2008 |title=Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine (Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology) |location=Totowa, NJ |publisher=Humana Press |page=6 |isbn=978-1934115046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Improve drug safety, and reduce ADRs;
* Tailor treatments to meet patients' unique genetic pre-disposition, identifying optimal dosing;
* Improve drug discovery targeted to human disease; and
* Improve proof of principle for efficacy trials.
Pharmacogenomics may be applied to several areas of medicine, including [[Pain Management]], [[Cardiology]], [[Oncology]], and [[Psychiatry]]. A place may also exist in [[Forensic Pathology]], in which pharmacogenomics can be used to determine the cause of death in drug-related deaths where no findings emerge using [[autopsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pelotti |first1=Susan | last2=Bini | first2=Carla | name-list-format = vanc | date=September 12, 2011 |title=Forensic Pharmacogenetics (Forensic Medicine - From Old Problems to New Challenges) | publisher=INTECH Open Access Publisher |page=268 |url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/forensic-medicine-from-old-problems-to-new-challenges/forensic-pharmacogenetics| isbn=978-953-307-262-3 |accessdate=2014-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cancer treatment]], pharmacogenomics tests are used to identify which patients are most likely to respond to certain [[cancer drugs]]. In behavioral health, pharmacogenomic tests provide tools for physicians and care givers to better manage medication selection and side effect amelioration. Pharmacogenomics is also known as companion diagnostics, meaning tests being bundled with drugs. Examples include [[KRAS]] test with [[cetuximab]] and [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]] test with [[gefitinib]]. Beside efficacy, germline pharmacogenetics can help to identify patients likely to undergo severe toxicities when given cytotoxics  showing impaired detoxification in relation with genetic polymorphism, such as canonical 5-FU.&lt;ref name="pmid20920994"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ciccolini J, Gross E, Dahan L, Lacarelle B, Mercier C | title = Routine dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase testing for anticipating 5-fluorouracil-related severe toxicities: hype or hope? | journal = Clin Colorectal Cancer | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 224–8 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20920994 | doi = 10.3816/CCC.2010.n.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular disorders]], the main concern is response to drugs including [[warfarin]], [[clopidogrel]], [[beta blocker]]s, and [[statin]]s.&lt;ref name=eval/&gt;

== Example case studies ==

''Case A – Antipsychotic adverse reaction''&lt;ref name="PMC2656342"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Foster A, Wang Z, Usman M, Stirewalt E, Buckley P | title = Pharmacogenetics of antipsychotic adverse effects: Case studies and a literature review for clinicians | journal = Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages =  965–973 |date=December 2007 | pmc=2656342 | pmid=19300635 | doi=10.2147/ndt.s1752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patient A suffers from schizophrenia. Their treatment included a combination of ziprasidone, olanzapine, trazodone and benzotropine. The patient experienced dizziness and sedation, so they were tapered off ziprasidone and olanzapine, and transition to quetiapine. Trazodone was discontinued. The patient then experienced excessive sweating, tachycardia and neck pain, gained considerable weight and had hallucinations. Five months later, quetiapine was tapered and discontinued, with ziprasidone re-introduction into their treatment due to the excessive weight gain. Although the patient lost the excessive weight they gained, they then developed muscle stiffness, [[cogwheeling]], tremor and night sweats. When benztropine was added they experienced blurry vision. After an additional five months, the patient was switched from ziprasidone to aripiprazole. Over the course of 8 months, patient A gradually experienced more weight gain, sedation, developed difficulty with their gait, stiffness, cogwheel and dyskinetic ocular movements. A pharmacogenomics test later proved the patient had a CYP2D6 *1/*41, with has a predicted phenotype of IM and CYP2C19 *1/*2 with predicted phenotype of IM as well.

''Case B – Pain Management'' &lt;ref name="url_AMA_Pharmacogenomic_Factsheet"&gt;{{cite web | url =  https://www.crediblemeds.org/files/3913/6973/9557/pgx-brochure2011.pdf | title = Pharmacogenetics: increasing the safety and effectiveness of drug therapy [Brochure] | date = 2011  | publisher = American Medical Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patient B is a woman who gave birth by caesarian section. Her physician prescribed codeine for post-caesarian pain. She took the standard prescribed dose, however experienced nausea and dizziness while she was taking codeine. She also noticed that her breastfed infant was lethargic and feeding poorly. When the patient mentioned these symptoms to her physician, they recommended that she discontinue codeine use. Within a few days, both the patient and her infant’s symptoms were no longer present. It is assumed that if the patient underwent a pharmacogenomic test, it would have revealed she may have had a duplication of the gene CYP2D6 placing her in the Ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) category, explaining her ADRs to codeine use.

''Case C – FDA Warning on Codeine Overdose for Infants''&lt;ref name="url_FDA_Codeine_Warning"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm339112.htm | title = FDA Drug Safety Communication: Safety review update of codeine use in children; new Boxed Warning and Contraindication on use after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy | date = 2013-02-20  | work = | publisher = United States Food and Drug Administration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2013, the FDA released a statement addressing a serious concern regarding the connection between children who are known as CYP2D6 UM and fatal reactions to codeine following [[tonsillectomy]] and/or [[adenoidectomy]] (surgery to remove the tonsils and/or adenoids). They released their strongest Boxed Warning to elucidate the dangers of CYP2D6 UMs consuming codeine. Codeine is converted to morphine by CYP2D6, and those who have UM phenotypes are at danger of producing large amounts of morphine due to the increased function of the gene. The morphine can elevate to life-threatening or fatal amounts, as became evident with the death of three children in August 2012.

== Polypharmacy ==

A potential role pharmacogenomics may play would be to reduce the occurrence of [[polypharmacy]]. It is theorized that with tailored drug treatments, patients will not have the need to take several medications that are intended to treat the same condition. In doing so, they could potentially minimize the occurrence of ADRs, have improved treatment outcomes, and can save costs by avoiding purchasing extraneous medications. An example of this can be found in [[psychiatry]], where patients tend to be receiving more medications than even age-matched non-psychiatric patients. This has been associated with an increased risk of inappropriate prescribing.&lt;ref name="polypharmacy_book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ritsner |first=Michael | date=2013 |title=Polypharmacy in Psychiatry Practice, Volume I. Multiple Medication Strategies | location=Dordrecht |publisher=Springer Science and Business Media |isbn=978-94-007-5804-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for pharmacogenomics tailored drug therapies may be most evident in a survey conducted by the Slone Epidemiology Center at [[Boston University]] from February 1998 to April 2007. The study elucidated that an average of 82% of adults in the United States are taking at least one medication (prescription or nonprescription drug, vitamin/mineral, herbal/natural supplement), and 29% are taking five or more. The study suggested that those aged 65 years or older continue to be the biggest consumers of medications, with 17-19 % in this age group taking at least ten medications in a given week. Polypharmacy has also shown to have increased since 2000 from 23% to 29%.&lt;ref name="Slone_Study"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bu.edu/slone/research/studies/slone-survey/ | title = Patterns of Medication Use in the United States | date = 2006  | work = | publisher = Boston University, Slone Epidemiology Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drug labeling ==

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) appears to be very invested in the science of pharmacogenomics&lt;ref name="url_European_Report"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ipts.jrc.ec.europa.eu/publications/pub.cfm?id=1387 | title = Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics: State-of-the-art and potential socio-economic impacts in the EU | date = 2006-04-01  | work = | publisher = European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Institute for Prospective Technological Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is demonstrated through the 120 and more FDA-approved drugs that include pharmacogenomic [[biomarkers]] in their labels.&lt;ref name="url_FDA_Pharmacogenomic_Biomarkers"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/drugs/scienceresearch/researchareas/pharmacogenetics/ucm083378.htm | title = Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labels | date = 2013-06-19  | work = | publisher = United States Food and Drug Administration }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This number increased varies over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abrahams E, Silver M | title = The case for personalized medicine | journal = Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 680–4 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 20144313 | pmc = 2769975 | doi = 10.1177/193229680900300411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the labels of FDA-approved drugs as of 20 June 2014 found that there were 140 different drugs with a pharmacogenomic biomarker in their label.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vivot A, Boutron I, Ravaud P, Porcher R | title = Guidance for pharmacogenomic biomarker testing in labels of FDA-approved drugs | language = En | journal = Genetics in Medicine | volume = 17 | issue = 9 | pages = 733–8 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25521333 | doi = 10.1038/gim.2014.181 | url = http://www.nature.com/articles/gim2014181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because a drug can have different biomarkers, this corresponded to 158 drug–biomarker pairs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Only 29% stated a requirement or recommendation for genetic biomarker testing  but this was higher for oncology  drugs (62%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On May 22, 2005, the FDA issued its first ''Guidance for Industry: Pharmacogenomic Data Submissions'', which clarified the type of pharmacogenomic data required to be submitted to the FDA and when.&lt;ref name="url_FDA_Personalized_Med_Report"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Xie HG, Frueh FW | title = Pharmacogenomics steps toward personalized medicine. | journal=Personalized Medicine | volume =2 | issue=4 | pages= 325–337| date = 2005 | url = http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/scienceresearch/researchareas/pharmacogenetics/ucm119614.pdf | doi=10.2217/17410541.2.4.325}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts recognized the importance of the FDA’s acknowledgement that pharmacogenomics experiments will not bring negative regulatory consequences.&lt;ref name="pmid15877053"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Katsnelson A | title = Cautious welcome for FDA pharmacogenomics guidance | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 510 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15877053 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0505-510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA had released its latest guide ''Clinical Pharmacogenomics (PGx): Premarket Evaluation in Early-Phase Clinical Studies and Recommendations for Labeling'' in January, 2013. The guide is intended to address the use of genomic information during drug development and regulatory review processes.

== Challenges ==

[[File:Pharmacogenomics challenges from research to practice.jpg|thumb|upright=2| Consecutive phases and associated challenges in Pharmacogenomics.&lt;ref name="sven2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Swen JJ, Huizinga TW, Gelderblom H, de Vries EG, Assendelft WJ, Kirchheiner J, Guchelaar HK |title= Translating Pharmacogenomics: Challenges on the Road to the Clinic| journal=PLoS Medicine | volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=1317–24 |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0040209 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040209 | pmid=17696640 | pmc=1945038}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although there appears to be a general acceptance of the basic tenet of pharmacogenomics amongst physicians and healthcare professionals,&lt;ref name="pmid22278335"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stanek EJ, Sanders CL, Taber KA, Khalid M, Patel A, Verbrugge RR, Agatep BC, Aubert RE, Epstein RS, Frueh FW | journal = Clin Pharmacol Ther | volume = 91 | issue = 3 | pages = 450–8 | pmid = 22278335 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.2011.306 | title=Adoption of pharmacogenomic testing by US physicians: results of a nationwide survey. | date=Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; several challenges exist that slow the uptake, implementation, and standardization of pharmacogenomics. Some of the concerns raised by physicians include:&lt;ref name="Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Factsheet."/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22278335"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22689709"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ma JD, Lee KC, Kuo GM | title = Clinical application of pharmacogenomics | journal = J Pharm Pract | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 417–27 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22689709 | doi = 10.1177/0897190012448309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Limitation on how to apply the test into clinical practices and treatment;
* A general feeling of lack of availability of the test;
* The understanding and interpretation of evidence-based research; and
* Ethical, legal and social issues.

Issues surrounding the availability of the test include:&lt;ref name="sven2007"/&gt;
* ''The lack of availability of scientific data'': Although there are considerable number of DME involved in the metabolic pathways of drugs, only a fraction have sufficient scientific data to validate their use within a clinical setting; and
* ''Demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics'': Publications for the [[pharmacoeconomics]] of pharmacogenomics are scarce, therefore sufficient evidence does not at this time exist to validate the cost-effectiveness and cost-consequences of the test.

Although other factors contribute to the slow progression of pharmacogenomics (such as developing guidelines for clinical use), the above factors appear to be the most prevalent.

== Controversies ==

Some [[allele]]s that vary in frequency between specific populations have been shown to be associated with differential responses to specific [[drugs]]. The [[beta blocker]] [[atenolol]] is an anti-[[Hypertension|hypertensive]] medication that is shown to more significantly lower the blood pressure of [[White American|Caucasian]] patients than [[African American]] patients in the United States. This observation suggests that Caucasian and African American populations have different alleles governing [[oleic acid]] biochemistry, which react differentially with atenolol.&lt;ref name="pmid23536766"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wikoff WR, Frye RF, Zhu H, Gong Y, Boyle S, Churchill E, Cooper-Dehoff RM, Beitelshees AL, Chapman AB, Fiehn O, Johnson JA, Kaddurah-Daouk R | title = Pharmacometabolomics reveals racial differences in response to atenolol treatment | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = e57639 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23536766 | pmc = 3594230 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0057639 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[hypersensitivity]] to the antiretroviral drug [[abacavir]] is strongly associated with a [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] that varies in frequency between populations.&lt;ref name="pmid20942671"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rotimi CN, Jorde LB | title = Ancestry and disease in the age of genomic medicine | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 363 | issue = 16 | pages = 1551–8 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20942671 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra0911564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA approval of the drug [[Isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine|BiDil (isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine)]] with a label specifying African-Americans with congestive heart failure, produced a storm of controversy over race-based medicine and fears of genetic stereotyping,&lt;ref name="pmid15533852"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bloche MG | title = Race-based therapeutics | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 351 | issue = 20 | pages = 2035–7 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15533852 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp048271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the label for BiDil did not specify any genetic variants but was based on racial self-identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url = http://paa2006.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=61713 | title = Back with a Vengeance: the Reemergence of a Biological Conceptualization of Race in Research on Race/Ethnic Disparities in Health | author = Frank R | booktitle = Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America | place = Los Angeles, California | date = March 30 – April 1, 2006 | accessdate = 2008-11-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081201101017/http://paa2006.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=61713 | archivedate = December 1, 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17668653"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Crawley L | title = The paradox of race in the Bidil debate | journal = J Natl Med Assoc | volume = 99 | issue = 7 | pages = 821–2 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17668653 | pmc = 2574363 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future ==

Computational advances in pharmacogenomics has proven to be a blessing in research. As a simple example, for nearly a decade the ability to store more information on a hard drive has enabled us to investigate a human genome sequence cheaper and in more detail with regards to the effects/risks/safety concerns of drugs and other such substances. Such computational advances are expected to continue in the future.&lt;ref name="pharmacogenomic_example_book"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kalow | first = Werner | name-list-format = vanc | title = Pharmacogenomics | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | location = New York | year = 2005 | pages = 552–3| isbn = 1-57444-878-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to use the genome sequence data to effectively make decisions in order to minimise the negative impacts on, say, a patient or the health industry in general. A large amount of research in the biomedical sciences regarding Pharmacogenomics as of late stems from combinatorial chemistry,&lt;ref name="pmid11908762"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Thorpe DS| title=Combinatorial chemistry: starting the second decade. | journal=Pharmacogenomics J | year= 2001 | volume= 1 | issue= 4 | pages= 229–32 | pmid=11908762 | doi= 10.1038/sj.tpj.6500045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; genomic mining, omic technologies and high throughput screening. In order for the field to grow, rich knowledge enterprises and business must work more closely together and adopt simulation strategies. Consequently, more importance must be placed on the role of computational biology with regards to safety and risk assessments. Here, we can find the growing need and importance of being able to manage large, complex data sets, being able to extract information by integrating disparate data so that developments can be made in improving human health.

'''Polonium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Po''' and [[atomic number]] 84. A rare and highly [[radioactive]] [[metal]] with no stable [[isotopes of polonium|isotopes]], polonium is chemically similar to [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]], though its metallic character resembles that of its [[Period 6 element|horizontal neighbors]] in the [[periodic table]]: [[thallium]], [[lead]], and [[bismuth]]. Due to the short [[half-life]] of all its isotopes, its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting polonium-210 (with a half-life of 138&amp;nbsp;days) in [[uranium]] [[ore]]s, as it is the [[Decay chain|penultimate daughter]] of natural [[Uranium-238#Radium series (or uranium series)|uranium-238]]. Though slightly longer-lived isotopes exist, they are much more difficult to produce. Today, polonium is usually produced in milligram quantities by the [[neutron irradiation]] of bismuth. Due to its intense radioactivity, which results in the [[radiolysis]] of [[chemical bond]]s and radioactive self-heating, its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only.

Polonium was discovered in 1898 by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]], when it was extracted from uranium ore and identified solely by its strong radioactivity: it was the first element to be so discovered. Polonium was named after Marie Curie's homeland of [[Poland]]. Polonium has few applications, and those are related to its radioactivity: heaters in [[space probe]]s, [[antistatic device]]s, and sources of [[neutron]]s and [[alpha particle]]s. This radioactivity makes polonium dangerously toxic.

==Characteristics==

&lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po is an [[alpha decay|alpha emitter]] that has a half-life of 138.4&amp;nbsp;days; it decays directly to its stable [[decay product|daughter isotope]], [[lead|&lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb]]. A milligram (5&amp;nbsp;[[curie]]s) of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po emits about as many alpha particles per second as 5&amp;nbsp;grams of [[radium|&lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra]].&lt;ref name=anl/&gt; A few [[curie]]s (1&amp;nbsp;curie equals 37&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|gigabecquerels]], 1&amp;nbsp;Ci = 37&amp;nbsp;GBq) of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po emit a blue glow which is caused by [[Ionized-air glow|ionisation]] of the surrounding air.

About one in 100,000&amp;nbsp;alpha emissions causes an excitation in the nucleus which then results in the emission of a gamma ray with a maximum energy of 803&amp;nbsp;keV.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atom.kaeri.re.kr/cgi-bin/decay?Po-210%20A|title=210PO α decay|work=Nuclear Data Center, Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute|date= 2000|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po (in common with [[Plutonium-238|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]]) has the ability [[Volatility (chemistry)|to become airborne with ease]]: if a sample is heated in air to {{convert|55|C|F}}, 50% of it is vaporized in 45 hours to form [[diatomic molecule|diatomic]] Po&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, even though the melting point of polonium is {{convert|254|C|F}} and its boiling point is {{convert|962|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first1 = Bogdan |last1=Wąs| first2 = Ryszard |last2=Misiak| first3 = Mirosław |last3=Bartyzel| first4 = Barbara |last4=Petelenz | title = Thermochromatographic Separation of &lt;sup&gt;206,208&lt;/sup&gt;Po from a Bismuth Target Bombardet with Protons | journal =Nukleonica | date =2006| volume =51 | issue = Suppl. 2 | pages = s3–s5 | url =http://www.ichtj.waw.pl/ichtj/nukleon/back/full/vol51_2006/v51s2p03f.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thayer p78"/&gt;
More than one hypothesis exists for how polonium does this; one suggestion is that small clusters of polonium atoms are [[spallation|spalled off]] by the alpha decay.

===Chemistry===
The chemistry of polonium is similar to that of [[tellurium]], although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor [[bismuth]] due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute [[acid]]s but is only slightly [[solubility|soluble]] in [[alkali]]s. Polonium [[solution]]s are first colored in pink by the Po&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into Po&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by [[Laboratory glassware|glassware]] due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed.&lt;ref name=nbb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagnall|Bagnall]], p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; At pH about 1, polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as [[oxalic acid]], [[citric acid]], and [[tartaric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Ullmann | first1=Cornelius |last1=Keller |first2=Walter |last2=Wolf |first3=Jashovam |last3=Shani | title = Radionuclides, 2. Radioactive Elements and Artificial Radionuclides | doi = 10.1002/14356007.o22_o15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Compounds====
Polonium has no common compounds, and almost all of its compounds are synthetically created; more than 50 of those are known.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagnall|Bagnall]], p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The most stable class of polonium compounds are [[polonide]]s, which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements. [[sodium polonide|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Po]] has the [[antifluorite]] structure, the polonides of [[calcium polonide|Ca]], [[barium polonide|Ba]], [[mercury polonide|Hg]], Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice, [[beryllium polonide|BePo]] and [[cadmium polonide|CdPo]] have the [[wurtzite]] and [[magnesium polonide|MgPo]] the [[nickel arsenide]] structure. Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600&amp;nbsp;°C, except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300&amp;nbsp;°C and the lanthanide polonides, which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. For example, PrPo melts at 1250&amp;nbsp;°C and TmPo at 2200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=g766&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 766&lt;/ref&gt; [[lead polonide|PbPo]] is one of the very few naturally occurring polonium compounds, as polonium [[alpha decay]]s to form [[lead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=F. |date=1959 |title=Chemie des Poloniums |journal=[[Angewandte Chemie]] |volume=71 |pages=289–316 |doi=10.1002/ange.19590710902 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polonium hydride]] ({{chem|Po||H|2}}) is a volatile liquid at room temperature prone to dissociation; it is thermally unstable.&lt;ref name=g766/&gt; [[properties of water|Water]] is the only other known [[hydrogen chalcogenide]] which is a liquid at room temperature; however, this is due to hydrogen bonding. The two oxides [[polonium dioxide|PoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[polonium trioxide|PoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] are the products of oxidation of polonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Holleman, A. F.| author2 = Wiberg, E. |title = Inorganic Chemistry| publisher = Academic Press| location = San Diego| date = 2001| isbn = 0-12-352651-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Halide]]s of the structure PoX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PoX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and PoF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; are known. They are soluble in the corresponding hydrogen halides, i.e., PoCl&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; in HCl, PoBr&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; in HBr and PoI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in HI.&lt;ref name=figgins/&gt; Polonium dihalides are formed by direct reaction of the elements or by reduction of PoCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and with PoBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S at room temperature. Tetrahalides can be obtained by reacting polonium dioxide with HCl, HBr or HI.&lt;ref name=g765&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], pp. 765, 771, 775&lt;/ref&gt;

This element was the first one discovered by the Curies while they were investigating the cause of [[uraninite|pitchblende]] [[radioactivity]]. Pitchblende, after removal of the radioactive elements [[uranium]] and [[thorium]], was more radioactive than the uranium and thorium combined. This spurred the Curies to search for additional radioactive elements. They first separated out polonium from pitchblende in July 1898, and five months later, also isolated [[radium]].&lt;ref name=nbb/&gt;&lt;ref name=c1/&gt;&lt;ref name=c2&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Curie, P. |author2=Curie, M. |author3=Bémont, G. |title=Sur une nouvelle substance fortement radio-active contenue dans la pechblende |trans-title=On a new, strongly radioactive substance contained in pitchblende |language=fr |journal=Comptes rendus |volume=127 |pages=1215–1217 |date=1898 |url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/activite/archive/dossiers/Curie/Curie_pdf/CR1898_p1215_1217.pdf |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722232602/http://www.academie-sciences.fr/activite/archive/dossiers/Curie/Curie_pdf/CR1898_p1215_1217.pdf |archivedate=July 22, 2013 }} [http://www.aip.org/history/curie/discover.htm English translation]&lt;/ref&gt; German scientist [[Willy Marckwald]] successfully isolated 3 milligrams of polonium in 1902, though at the time he believed it was a new element, which he dubbed "radio-tellurium", and it was not until 1905 that it was demonstrated to be the same as polonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Polonium and Radio-Tellurium | journal = Nature | volume = 73 | issue = 549 | pages = 549 |date = 1906 | doi = 10.1038/073549b0| bibcode = 1906Natur..73R.549. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Neufeldt |first = Sieghard | title = Chronologie Chemie: Entdecker und Entdeckungen | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year = 2012 | isbn = 9783527662845 | url = {{Google books|0lFQjLAlgC0C|plainurl=y|page=115}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, polonium was produced as part of the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Dayton Project]] during [[World War II]]. It was a critical part of the [[Nuclear weapon design|implosion-type]] nuclear weapon design used in the [[Fat Man]] bomb on [[Nagasaki]] in 1945. Polonium and [[beryllium]] were the key ingredients of the '[[Modulated neutron initiator#Urchin|urchin]]' detonator at the center of the bomb's spherical [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|plutonium pit]].&lt;ref name="nwfaq41"&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html Nuclear Weapons FAQ, Section 4.1, Version 2.04: 20 February 1999].

==Occurrence and production==
Polonium is a very rare element in nature because of the short [[half-life]] of all its isotopes. &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po, &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Po, and &lt;sup&gt;218&lt;/sup&gt;Po appear in the [[decay chain]] of [[uranium-238|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U]]; thus polonium can be found in [[uranium]] ores at about 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg per [[metric ton]] (1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 746&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagnall|Bagnall]], p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; which is approximately 0.2% of the abundance of radium. The amounts in the Earth's crust are not harmful. Polonium has been found in [[tobacco smoke]] from tobacco leaves grown with [[phosphate]] fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kilthau | first = Gustave F. |title = Cancer risk in relation to radioactivity in tobacco |journal = Radiologic Technology |volume = 67 |pages = 217–222| pmid = 8850254| date = 1996| issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidslink.bo.cnr.it/besta/fumo/epolonio.html |title=Alpha Radioactivity (210 Polonium) and Tobacco Smoke |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609055245/http://kidslink.bo.cnr.it/besta/fumo/epolonio.html |archivedate=June 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Muggli08&gt;{{cite journal |title = Waking a Sleeping Giant: The Tobacco Industry's Response to the Polonium-210 Issue |last = Monique | first = E.

Because it is present in small concentrations, isolation of polonium from natural sources is a tedious process. The largest batch of the element ever extracted, performed in the first half of the 20th century, contained only {{convert|40|Ci|TBq|abbr=on}} (9&amp;nbsp;mg) of [[polonium-210]] and was obtained by processing 37 tonnes of residues from radium production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Adloff, J.

The longer-lived isotopes of polonium, &lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Po and &lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Po, can be formed by [[proton]] or [[deuteron]] bombardment of bismuth using a [[cyclotron]].

==Applications==
Polonium-based sources of alpha particles were produced in the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=rus1/&gt; Such sources were applied for measuring the thickness of industrial coatings via attenuation of alpha radiation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagnall|Bagnall]], p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of intense alpha radiation, a one-gram sample of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po will spontaneously heat up to above {{convert|500|C|F}} generating about 140 watts of power. Therefore, &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po is used as an atomic heat source to power [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s via [[thermoelectric]] materials.&lt;ref name=anl&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/polonium.pdf | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070703021010/http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/polonium.pdf | archivedate =2007-07-03 |title = Polonium |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory| accessdate = 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nbb/&gt;&lt;ref name=g251&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=07TEK_w3A4AC&amp;pg=PA183 |page=183 |last=Hanslmeier |first= Arnold |title= The sun and space weather |publisher=Springer |date=2002 |isbn=1-4020-0684-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po heat sources were used in the [[Lunokhod]] 1 (1970) and Lunokhod 2 (1973) [[Moon]] rovers to keep their internal components warm during the lunar nights, as well as the [[List of Kosmos satellites (1–250)|Kosmos 84]] and 90 satellites (1965).&lt;ref name=rus1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://npc.sarov.ru/issues/sarovbook/section3p11.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501055529/http://npc.sarov.ru/issues/sarovbook/section3p11.html |archive-date=May 1, 2007 |title=Радиоизотопные источники тепла |dead-url=yes |accessdate=June 1, 2016}} (in Russian). npc.sarov.ru&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Andrew | last = Wilson| title = Solar System Log |location = London| publisher = Jane's Publishing Company Ltd| date = 1987 |page = 64| isbn = 0-7106-0444-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polonium needs to be replaced in these devices nearly every year because of its short half-life; it is also highly radioactive and therefore has been mostly replaced by less dangerous [[beta decay|beta particle]] sources.&lt;ref name=anl/&gt;

Tiny amounts of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po are sometimes used in the laboratory and for teaching purposes—typically of the order of {{convert|4|-|40|kBq|µCi|abbr=on}}, in the form of sealed sources, with the polonium deposited on a substrate or in a resin or polymer matrix—are often exempt from licensing by the NRC and similar authorities as they are not considered hazardous. Small amounts of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po are manufactured for sale to the public in the United States as 'needle sources' for laboratory experimentation, and they are retailed by scientific supply companies. The polonium is a layer of plating which in turn is plated with a material such as gold, which allows the [[alpha radiation]] (used in experiments such as cloud chambers) to pass while preventing the polonium from being released and presenting a toxic hazard. According to [[United Nuclear]], they typically sell between four and eight such sources per year.&lt;ref&gt;

Polonium [[spark plug]]s were marketed by [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] from 1940 to 1953. While the amount of radiation from the plugs was minuscule and not a threat to the consumer, the benefits of such plugs quickly diminished after approximately a month because of polonium's short half-life and because buildup on the conductors would block the radiation that improved engine performance. (The premise behind the polonium spark plug, as well as [[Alfred Matthew Hubbard]]'s prototype [[radium]] plug that preceded it, was that the radiation would improve ionization of the fuel in the cylinder and thus allow the motor to fire more quickly and efficiently.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/consumer%20products/sparkplugs.htm|title=Radioactive spark plugs|publisher=Oak Ridge Associated Universities|date=January 20, 1999|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utoledo.edu/nsm/ic/elements/polonium.html|first=Cassandra|last=Pittman|title=Polonium|work=The Instrumentation Center|publisher=University of Toledo|date=February 3, 2017|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology and toxicity==

===Overview===
Polonium is highly dangerous and has no biological role.&lt;ref name=nbb/&gt; By mass, polonium-210 is around 250,000 times more toxic than [[hydrogen cyanide]] (the {{LD50}} for &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po is less than 1 [[microgram]] for an average adult (see below) compared with about 250 [[milligrams]] for hydrogen cyanide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://physchem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/HY/hydrogen_cyanide.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20020211054154/http://physchem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/HY/hydrogen_cyanide.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2002-02-11 |title =Safety data for hydrogen cyanide|work= Physical &amp; Theoretical Chemistry Lab, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The main hazard is its intense radioactivity (as an alpha emitter), which makes it difficult to handle safely. Even in [[microgram]] amounts, handling &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po is extremely dangerous, requiring specialized equipment (a negative pressure alpha [[glove box]] equipped with high-performance filters), adequate monitoring, and strict handling procedures to avoid any contamination. Alpha particles emitted by polonium will damage organic tissue easily if polonium is ingested, inhaled, or absorbed, although they do not penetrate the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and hence are not hazardous as long as the alpha particles remain outside the body. Wearing chemically resistant and intact gloves is a mandatory precaution to avoid transcutaneous [[diffusion]] of polonium directly through the [[skin]]. Polonium delivered in concentrated [[nitric acid]] can easily diffuse through inadequate gloves (e.g., [[latex gloves]]) or the acid may damage the gloves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagnall|Bagnall]], pp. 202–6&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that some [[microbe]]s can [[Methylation|methylate]] polonium by the action of [[methylcobalamin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Momoshima | first1 =N.|last2= Song | first2 = L.

Studies investigating the metabolism of polonium-210 in rats have shown that only 0.002 to 0.009% of polonium-210 ingested is excreted as volatile polonium-210.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |last1=Li |first1=Chunsheng |last2=Sadi |first2=Baki |last3=Wyatt |first3=Heather |last4=Bugden |first4=Michelle |last5=Priest |first5=Nicholas |last6=Wilkinson |first6=Diana |last7=Kramer |first7=Gary H. |date=2010 |title=Metabolism of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po in rats: volatile &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po in excreta |journal=Radiation Protection Dosimetry |volume=140 |issue=2 |pages=158–162 |publisher=Oxford University Press |doi=10.1093/rpd/ncq047 |url=http://rpd.oxfordjournals.org/content/140/2/158.short |accessdate=2013-04-09 |pmid=20159915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acute effects===
The [[median lethal dose]] (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) for acute radiation exposure is about 4.5&amp;nbsp;[[Sievert|Sv]].&lt;ref name=pnl&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-14424.pdf |title =Health Impacts from Acute Radiation Exposure| accessdate = 2009-05-05|work=Pacific Northwest National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE)|committed effective dose equivalent]] &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po is 0.51&amp;nbsp;µSv/[[Becquerel|Bq]] if ingested, and 2.5&amp;nbsp;µSv/Bq if inhaled.&lt;ref name=nsds&gt;{{cite web| url = http://hpschapters.org/northcarolina/NSDS/210PoPDF.pdf |title =Nuclide Safety Data Sheet: Polonium–210| accessdate = 2009-05-05|work=hpschapters.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; So a fatal 4.5&amp;nbsp;Sv dose can be caused by ingesting {{convert|8.8|MBq|µCi|abbr=on}}, about 50 [[nanogram]]s (ng), or inhaling {{convert|1.8|MBq|µCi|abbr=on}}, about 10&amp;nbsp;ng. One gram of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po could thus in theory poison 20 million people of whom 10 million would die. The actual toxicity of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po is lower than these estimates because radiation exposure that is spread out over several weeks (the [[biological half-life]] of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| osti =7162390 |url=http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=7162390|title =Effective half-life of polonium in the human|author=Naimark, D.H.|date=1949-01-04|work=Technical Report MLM-272/XAB, Mound Lab., Miamisburg, OH}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose.

===Regulatory exposure limits and handling===
The maximum allowable body burden for ingested &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po is only {{convert|1.1|kBq|nCi|abbr=on}}, which is equivalent to a particle massing only 6.8 picograms. The maximum permissible workplace concentration of airborne &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po is about 10&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ({{val|3|e=-10}}&amp;nbsp;µCi/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/appb/Polonium-210.html |title = Nuclear Regulatory Commission limits for &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po| date = 2008-12-12 |accessdate = 2009-01-12 |publisher = U.S. NRC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target organs for polonium in humans are the [[spleen]] and [[liver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.pilgrimwatch.org/health1.html | title =PilgrimWatch – Pilgrim Nuclear – Health Impact | accessdate =2009-05-05 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090105192000/http://www.pilgrimwatch.org/health1.html | archive-date =2009-01-05 | dead-url =yes | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the spleen (150&amp;nbsp;g) and the liver (1.3 to 3&amp;nbsp;kg) are much smaller than the rest of the body, if the polonium is concentrated in these vital organs, it is a greater threat to life than the dose which would be suffered (on average) by the whole body if it were spread evenly throughout the body, in the same way as [[caesium]] or [[tritium]] (as T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).

There is talk that it might tighten the polonium reporting requirement by a factor of 10, to {{convert|1.6|Ci}}."&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/19/opinion/19zimmerman.html |title=The Smoky Bomb Threat |accessdate=2006-12-19 |publisher=The New York Times |first=Peter D. |last=Zimmerman|date=2006-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, this is still the only alpha emitting byproduct material available, as a NRC Exempt Quantity, which may be held without a radioactive material license.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Polonium and its compounds must be handled in a [[glove box]], which is further enclosed in another box, maintained at a slightly higher pressure than the glove box to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out. Gloves made of natural [[rubber]] do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary. [[Neoprene]] gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagnall|Bagnall]], p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

===Well-known poisoning cases===

====20th century====
Polonium was administered to humans for experimental purposes from 1943 to 1947; it was injected into four hospitalised patients, and orally given to a fifth. Studies such as this were funded by the [[Manhattan Project]] and the AEC and conducted at the University of Rochester. The objective was to obtain data on human excretion of polonium to correlate with more extensive data from rats. Patients selected as subjects were chosen because experimenters wanted persons who had not been exposed to polonium either through work or accident. All subjects had incurable diseases. Excretion of polonium was followed, and an autopsy was conducted at that time on the deceased patient to determine which organs absorbed the polonium. Patients' ages ranged from 'early thirties' to 'early forties'. The experiments were described in Chapter 3 of Biological Studies with Polonium, Radium, and Plutonium, National Nuclear Energy Series, Volume VI-3, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1950. Not specified is the isotope under study, but at the time polonium-210 was the most readily available polonium isotope. The DoE factsheet submitted for this experiment reported no follow up on these subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=American nuclear guinea pigs : three decades of radiation experiments on U.S. citizens|url=http://contentdm.library.unr.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/conghear/id/102#metajump|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] was the first person to die from the radiation effects of polonium. She was accidentally exposed to polonium in 1946 when a sealed capsule of the element exploded on her laboratory bench. In 1956, she died from [[leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,20863878-5001031,00.html |title=Innocent chemical a killer |publisher=The Daily Telegraph (Australia) |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2009-05-05 |first=Jeremy |last=Manier |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106013604/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,20863878-5001031,00.html |archivedate=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2008 book ''The Bomb in the Basement'', several deaths in Israel during 1957–1969 were caused by &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Karpin|first = Michael|title = The bomb in the basement: How Israel went nuclear and what that means for the world|publisher =Simon and Schuster|date = 2006 |isbn = 0-7432-6594-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leak was discovered at a [[Weizmann Institute]] laboratory in 1957. Traces of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po were found on the hands of Professor Dror Sadeh, a physicist who researched radioactive materials. Medical tests indicated no harm, but the tests did not include bone marrow. Sadeh died from [[cancer]]. One of his students died of leukemia, and two colleagues died after a few years, both from cancer. The issue was investigated secretly, and there was never any formal admission that a connection between the leak and the deaths had existed.&lt;ref name='LA Times 2007-01-01'&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas |last=Maugh |author2=Karen Kaplan |title=A restless killer radiates intrigue |date=2007-01-01|url =http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/01/science/sci-polonium1 |work =Los Angeles Times |accessdate = 2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko}}
The cause of death in the [[Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko|2006 homicide]] of [[Alexander Litvinenko]], a Russian KGB agent who had defected to the British MI6 intelligence agency, was determined to be &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The mystery of Litvinenko's death |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6180432.stm |date=2006-11-24 |publisher=BBC News |first=Tom |last=Geoghegan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6698545.stm |title = UK requests Lugovoi extradition| accessdate = 2009-05-05|work=BBC News|date=2007-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Prof. Nick Priest of [[Middlesex University]], an [[Environmental toxicology|environmental toxicologist]] and radiation expert, speaking on [[Sky News]] on December 3, 2006, Litvinenko was probably the first person to die of the [[Acute (medical)|acute]] α-radiation effects of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Focus: Cracking the code of the nuclear assassin |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2484295_1,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210081034/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2484295_1,00.html|archivedate=2008-02-10|work=The Sunday Times|location=London|date=2006-12-03|accessdate=2010-05-22|first=Roland|last=Watson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abnormally high concentrations of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po were detected in July 2012 in clothes and personal belongings of the Palestinian leader [[Yasser Arafat]], a heavy smoker, who died on 11 November 2004 of uncertain causes. The spokesman for the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, where those items were analyzed, stressed that the "clinical symptoms described in Arafat's medical reports were not consistent with polonium-210 and that conclusions could not be drawn as to whether the Palestinian leader was poisoned or not", and that "the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat's body to test it for polonium-210."&lt;ref&gt;Bart, Katharina (2012-07-03).

It has been suggested that [[chelation therapy|chelation agents]], such as British Anti-Lewisite ([[dimercaprol]]), can be used to decontaminate humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm071944.pdf |format=PDF |title = Guidance for Industry.

===Detection in biological specimens===
Polonium-210 may be quantified in biological specimens by alpha particle spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. The baseline urinary excretion of polonium-210 in healthy persons due to routine exposure to environmental sources is normally in a range of 5–15 mBq/day. Levels in excess of 30 mBq/day are suggestive of excessive exposure to the radionuclide.&lt;ref&gt;Baselt, R. [http://www.biomedicalpublications.com/dt10.pdf ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man''], 10th edition, Biomedical Publications, Seal Beach, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occurrence in humans and the biosphere===
Polonium-210 is widespread in the [[biosphere]], including in human tissues, because of its position in the [[Uranium series|uranium-238 decay chain]]. Natural [[uranium-238]] in the [[Earth's crust]] decays through a series of solid radioactive intermediates including [[radium-226]] to the radioactive noble gas [[radon-222]], some of which, during its 3.8-day half-life, diffuses into the atmosphere. There it decays through several more steps to polonium-210, much of which, during its 138-day half-life, is washed back down to the Earth's surface, thus entering the biosphere, before finally decaying to stable [[lead-206]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1038/187211a0|title =Lead-210 and Polonium-210 in Grass|date =1960|last1 =Hill|first1 = C.

As early as the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using polonium provided by his colleague [[Marie Curie]], showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in [[liver]], [[kidney]], and [[testes]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacassagne, A. &amp; Lattes, J. (1924) ''Bulletin d'Histologie Appliquée à la Physiologie et à la Pathologie'', '''1''', 279.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur, also in group 16 of the periodic table, in sulfur-containing amino-acids or related molecules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor = 3577929|pages = 379–382|last1 = Vasken Aposhian|first1 = H.|last2 = Bruce|first2 = D.

===Tobacco===
[[Polonium-210]] in tobacco contributes to many of the cases of [[lung cancer]] worldwide. Most of this polonium is derived from [[lead-210]] deposited on tobacco leaves from the atmosphere; the lead-210 is a product of [[radon-222]] gas, much of which appears to originate from the decay of [[radium-226]] from fertilizers applied to the tobacco soils.&lt;ref name="Muggli08"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martell1974&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martell|first1=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5368">'''Reality testing''' is the psychotherapeutic function by which the objective or real world and one's relationship to it are reflected on and evaluated by the observer. This process of distinguishing the internal world of thoughts and feelings from the external world is a technique commonly used in [[psychoanalysis]] and [[behavior therapy]], and was originally devised by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1911). Formulations regarding the two principles in mental functioning. ''Collected papers'', ''4'', 13-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
Within [[psychotherapy]] and [[counseling]] settings, practitioners use reality testing to influence the patient or client to recognize their negative thoughts, evaluate the thoughts logically rather than emotionally, and then determine whether the thoughts are valid (ie: internally consistent and grounded in reality). The focus of reality testing is not necessarily concentrated on the source of the behavior or thought, but rather on the fact that current thoughts are occurring and influencing behaviors in the here-and-now. After undergoing this technique, the patient or client is often able to see that the thoughts he or she has been experiencing are, in fact, not valid or based on reality, and should therefore not be used as the basis for life decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Landa, Y., Silverstein, S. M., Schwartz, F., &amp; Savitz, A. (2006). Group cognitive behavioral therapy for delusions: helping patients improve reality testing. ''Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy'', ''36'', 9-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Reality testing can be used in this way to help facilitate corrective emotional experiences by disconfirming and altering previously held negative or unrealistic expectations in favor of more adaptive functions.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, F. G. (1980). ''Psychoanalytic therapy: Principles and application''. University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Psychotherapy methods such as [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] rely heavily on the client's ability to frequently self-examine internal thoughts and assess their preceding influence on perceptions, judgments, and behaviors. Continual reality testing directed by therapists can help educate clients on how to habitually examine their own thought patterns and behaviors without the ongoing need for a therapist.  Constant and prolonged exposure to a multitude of corrective experiences can lead clients to form their own internal and enduring changes in thoughts, expectations, feelings, and behavior.&lt;ref name=P&amp;G&gt;Pachankis, J. E., &amp; Goldfried, M. R. (2007). ''An integrative, principle-based approach to psychotherapy: the art and science of psychotherapy'', 49-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Reality testing has also been identified as a curative factor when implemented within a group therapy setting. In group counseling, clients can use the perspectives of other group members as the basis of reality testing and receive instant feedback through group discussions, roleplaying, and other group activities.&lt;ref&gt;Yalom, I.D. and  Leszcz, M. (2005) ''The Theory &amp; Practice of Group Psychotherapy (5th ed.).'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Therapists using reality testing techniques typically rely upon the client's mental processes of attention, perception, memory, and judgment in order to help guide them to the formation of logical conclusions about how their internal experiences are related to external reality.&lt;ref&gt;Hurvich, M. (1970). On the concept of reality testing. ''[[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'', ''51'', 299-312.&lt;/ref&gt;
Limited reality testing capabilities can sometimes be a function of a [[mental disorder]]. People exhibiting limited reality testing might lack the insight and ability to distinguish between the external and internal world as a factor of [[psychosis]].

Emphasizing ongoing reality testing in the client's life has been demonstrated to be among the principles of change that can be used to explain and account for the underlying effectiveness of therapeutic counseling techniques, regardless of theoretical ideals. For this reason, aspects of reality testing can be included into a variety of therapeutic treatment plans.&lt;ref name=P&amp;G /&gt;

Prof '''Robert Freer'''  (or '''Frier''') [[FRSE]] [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh|FRCPE]] (1745-1827) was a soldier and academic, who taught Medicine at the [[University of Glasgow]]. He was [[Regius Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics (Glasgow)|Regius Professor of Medicine]] from 1796 until death (31 years). He was twice President of the Medical Society of Edinburgh (1772-4 and 1775-8). He was President of the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]] in 1797.

==Life==
He was born in [[Perthshire]]. He studied Medicine at [[Aberdeen University]] graduating MA in 1765. He then did further studies at both [[Edinburgh University]] and [[Leyden University]] in Holland.
In 1776 he was recorded as a member of the [[Glasgow Literary Society]]. In the same year he gave an eloquent speech to the Medical Society of Edinburgh whilst acting as their Senior President.&lt;ref&gt;Scots Magazine, June 1776, p.339&lt;/ref&gt;

In early life he served as an Ensign and military surgeon both in Europe and in the [[American war of independence]]. In 1779 he settled in Glasgow as a physician, in which year Glasgow University gave him his doctorate (MD). From 1796 he was Professor of Medicine at [[Glasgow University]] jointly acting as head Physician at [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]]. In the same year he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], his proposers being [[Daniel Rutherford]], [[James Finlayson (minister)|James Finlayson]] and [[Thomas Charles Hope]]. He had previously (1793) been unsuccessfully proposed by Daniel Rutherford, [[James Hutton]] and [[John Walker (natural historian)|John Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst teaching he lived at the College Court within the university.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1805&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816 he is listed as a Director of the Glasgow Lunatic Asylum.&lt;ref&gt;Annals of Glasgow, James Cleland&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Glasgow]] on 9 April 1827.

'''Samuel George Morton''' (January 26, 1799 – May 15, 1851) was an American physician and [[natural scientist]]. Morton, who was reared a Quaker but became Episcopalian in midlife, was born in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, attended [[Westtown School]], and graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.penn.museum/sites/morton/life.php&lt;/ref&gt; After earning an advanced degree from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in Scotland, he began practice in Philadelphia in 1824.

Morton was a prolific writer of books on various subjects from 1823 to 1851. He wrote ''Geological Observations'' in 1828, and both ''Synopsis of the Organic Remains of the Cretaceous Group of the United States'' and ''Illustrations of Pulmonary Consumption'' in 1834. His first medical essay, on the user of cornine in intermittent fever, in 1825 was published in the ''[[Philadelphia Journal of the Medical and Physical Sciences]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Introductory lectures and addresses on medical subjects : delivered chiefly before the medical classes of the University of Pennsylvania / by George B.

=="American School" ethnography==
Samuel George Morton is often thought of as the originator of "American School" [[ethnography]], a school of thought in [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] American science that claimed the difference between humans was one of [[species]] rather than [[Variety (biology)|variety]] and is seen by some as the origin of [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fredrickson |first=George M. |title=The Black Image in the White Mind: The Debate on African-American Character and Destiny, 1817–1914 |location=New York |publisher=Harper Torchbooks |year=1972 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton argued against the single creation story of the Bible ([[monogenism]]) and instead supported a theory of multiple racial creations ([[polygenism]]). Morton claimed the Bible supported polygenism, and within working in a biblical framework his theory held that each race had been created separately and each was given specific, irrevocable characteristics.&lt;ref name="David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38"&gt;David Hurst Thomas, Skull Wars Kennewick Man, Archaeology, And The Battle For Native American Identity, 2001, pp. 38 – 41&lt;/ref&gt;

After inspecting three mummies from ancient Egyptian catacombs, Morton concluded that Caucasians and Negroes were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since the Bible indicated that [[Noah's Ark]] had washed up on [[Mount Ararat]], only a thousand years ago before this, Morton claimed that Noah's sons could not possibly account for every race on earth. According to Morton's theory of polygenesis, races have been separate since the start.&lt;ref name="David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38"/&gt;

Morton claimed that he could define the intellectual ability of a race by the [[Human skull|skull]] capacity. A large volume meant a large brain and high intellectual capacity, and a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. He was reputed to hold the largest collection of skulls, on which he based his research. He claimed that each race had a separate origin, and that a descending order of intelligence could be discerned that placed [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] at the pinnacle and [[Negroes]] at the lowest point, with various other race groups in between.&lt;ref name=Bates1995p225 /&gt; Morton had many skulls from ancient Egypt, and concluded that the [[ancient Egyptians]] were not [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], but were Caucasian. His results were published in three volumes between 1839 and 1849: the ''Crania Americana'', ''An Inquiry into the Distinctive Characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America'' and ''Crania Aegyptiaca''.&lt;ref name=Bates1995p225 /&gt; Morton's skull collection was held at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia until 1966, when it was transferred to the Penn Museum, where it is presently curated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.penn.museum/sites/morton/collection.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton's theories were very popular in his day, and he was a highly respected physician and scientist. The anthropologist [[Aleš Hrdlička]] called Morton "the father of American physical anthropology".&lt;ref&gt;Clark Spencer Larsen, A Companion to Biological Anthropology, 2010, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Crispin Bates has noted that Morton's "systematic justification" for the separation of races, along with the work of [[Louis Agassiz]], was also used by those who favoured slavery in the United States, with the ''[[Charleston Medical Journal]]'' noting at his death that "We of the South should consider him as our benefactor for aiding most materially in giving to the negro his true position as an inferior race."&lt;ref name=Bates1995p225&gt;{{cite book |title=The Concept of Race in South Asia |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Delhi |year=1995 |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Robb |first=Crispin |last=Bates |chapter=Race, Caste and Tribe in Central India: the early origins of Indian anthropometry |isbn=978-0-19-563767-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwNkQgAACAAJ |page=225 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Craniology===
[[File:Morton-Frontispiece-Types-of-Mankind.jpg|thumb|250px|Engraving of Morton from the frontispiece to ''Types of Mankind'' by Nott and Gliddon]]
Morton claimed in his ''Crania Americana'' that the Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches (1,426 cc), Indians were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches (1,344 cc) and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches (1,278 cc).&lt;ref name="David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38"/&gt; Morton believed that the skulls of each race were so different that a wise creator from the beginning had created each race and positioned them in separate homelands to dwell in.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman, Race, racism, and science: social impact and interaction, 2005, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton believed that cranial capacity determined intellectual ability, and he used his craniometric evidence in conjunction with his analysis of anthropological literature then available to argue in favor of a racial hierarchy which put Caucasians on the top rung and Africans on the bottom. His skull measurements (by volume) then came to serve as "evidence" for racial stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://canada.metropolis.net/EVENTS/ethnocultural/publications/historical.pdf | title=The Historical Construction of Racial Identity and Implications for Reconciliation | year=2001 | accessdate=April 24, 2015 | author=Backhouse, Constance | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131195914/http://canada.metropolis.net/EVENTS/ethnocultural/publications/historical.pdf | archivedate=January 31, 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the Caucasian as "distinguished by the facility with which it attains the highest intellectual endowments"; Native Americans were described as "averse to cultivation, and slow in acquiring knowledge; restless, revengeful, and fond of war, and wholly destitute of maritime adventure" and the Africans he described as "joyous, flexible, and indolent; while the many nations which compose this race present a singular diversity of intellectual character, of which the far extreme is the lowest grade of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Menand, L. (2001). Morton, Agassiz, and the origins of scientific racism in the United States. Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, 110-113.  Even in his time, some physicians opposed the idea that there were differences in average cranial size across races.  The German physician [[Friedrich Tiedemann]], for instance, argued vigorously that previous scholars who found differences in cranial size across races were wrong in their measurements (or in some cases had too small a sample to draw inferences). Tiedemann advanced this in 1838 in his paper [http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/126/497.full.pdf On the Brain of the Negro Compared with that of the European and the Ourang-Outang.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton's followers, particularly [[Josiah C. Nott]] and [[George Gliddon]] in their monumental tribute to Morton's work, ''Types of Mankind'' (1854), carried Morton's ideas further and backed up his findings which supported the notion of [[polygenism]] – the premise that the different races were separately created by God. The publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 changed the nature of the scholarly debate.&lt;ref name=Bates1995p225 /&gt;

==Criticism==

===Allegations of bias in data collection===
In a 1978 paper&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1978). [http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/MCDB4234/readings/Morton-Skulls-Gould.pdf "Morton's Ranking of Races by Cranial Capacity."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618000422/http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/MCDB4234/readings/Morton-Skulls-Gould.pdf |date=2011-06-18 }} ''Science'' 200 (May 5): 503–509.&lt;/ref&gt; and later in ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1981), [[Stephen Jay Gould]] asserted that Morton had, perhaps because of an unconscious bias, selectively reported data, manipulated sample compositions, made analytical errors, and mismeasured skulls in order to support his prejudicial views on [[Race and intelligence|intelligence differences]] between different populations. Gould's book became widely read and Morton came to be considered one of the main cases of the effects of unconscious bias in data collection, and as one of the main figures in the early history of scientific racism.

Subsequently, two separate studies of Morton's data and methods, one conducted in 1988 and the other in 2011, argued that Gould had overstated or misrepresented the case, and that Morton's measurement's were essentially correct.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Nicholas (2011). [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/science/14skull.html?_r=1&amp;ref=science "Scientists Measure the Accuracy of a Racism Claim."] ''The New York Times'' (June 14): D4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter study, entitled "The Mismeasure of Science: Stephen Jay Gould versus Samuel George Morton on Skulls and Bias"&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, J., D. DeGusta, M. Meyer, J. Monge, A. Mann, and R. Holloway (2011). [http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001071 "The Mismeasure of Science."] ''Public Library of Science Biology'' 9 (6): e1001071.&lt;/ref&gt; and authored by six [[anthropology|anthropologists]], it was concluded that the bias came from Gould, who failed to examine and remeasure the crania in order to determine Morton's level of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Morton collection of skulls at center of controversy. June 16, 2011.  http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-06-samuel-morton-skulls-center-controversy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this study was reviewed in an editorial in ''Nature'', which recommended a degree of caution, stating "the critique leaves the majority of Gould's work unscathed," and noted that "because they couldn't measure all the skulls, they do not know whether the average cranial capacities that Morton reported represent his sample accurately."&lt;ref name="Nature2011"&gt;Editorial (2011). [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v474/n7352/full/474419a.html "Mismeasure for mismeasure."] ''Nature'' 474 (23 June): 419.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal stated that Gould's opposition to racism may have biased his interpretation of Morton's data, but also noted that "Lewis and his colleagues have their own motivations. Several in the group have an association with the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and have an interest in seeing the valuable but understudied skull collection freed from the stigma of bias" and did not accept Gould's theory "that the scientific method is inevitably tainted by bias."&lt;ref name="Nature2011"/&gt;

A 2014 review of the paper by University of Pennsylvania philosophy professor Michael Weisberg, tended to support Gould's original accusations, concluding that "there is prima facie evidence of a racial bias in Morton's measurements". Weisberg concludes that although Gould did commit mistakes in his own treatment, Morton's work "remains a cautionary example of racial bias in the science of human differences".&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, M. (2014), Remeasuring man. Evolution &amp; Development, 16: 166–178. doi: 10.1111/ede.12077&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biases in Data Interpretation===

Research by Paul Wolff Mitchell in 2018 argues that Morton was nevertheless guilty of bias, though not in data collection. Mitchell argues that Morton's interpretation of his data was erroneous; he investigated averages and ignored variations in skull size so large that there was significant overlap. A contemporary of Morton, Friedrich Tiedemann, had collected similar skull data and drawn conclusions opposite to Morton's on the basis of this overlap.   &lt;ref&gt; Ars Technica [https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/theres-new-evidence-confirming-bias-of-the-father-of-scientific-racism/ "There’s new evidence confirming bias of the “father of scientific racism”]&lt;\ref&gt;

'''Sengers syndrome''' is a rare [[autosomal recessive]] condition characterised by congenital [[cataract]], [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]], muscle weakness and [[lactic acidosis]] after exercise. 

==Signs/symptoms==

There are two forms of the disease - a lethal neonatal form and a chronic form. 

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is diagnosed at birth in half. Death in the first year is usually due to [[cardiac failure]]. Marked lactic acidemia occurs with even limited muscular exertion. 

The chronic form have stable cardiomyopathy and myopathy with a normal intellect. 

Other reported features include [[nystagmus]], [[strabismus]], [[hypotonia]], [[hyporeflexia]] and [[delayed motor development]]. 

==Genetics==

This disease is caused by [[mutation]]s in [[AGK (gene)|AGK]] or [[SLC25A4]] genes. The AGK gene encodes the mitochondrial [[acylglycerol kinase]] which plays a role in the assembly of [[adenine nucleotide translocator]]. The [[SLC25A4]] gene encodes the heart and muscle specific [[isoform]] 1 of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator.

==Epidemiology==

Sengers syndrome is a rare disorder. About 40 cases have been reported worldwide.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis may be provisionally made on clinical grounds. Further diagnostic tests include serum and [[urine analysis]] for [[lactic acid]], a [[chest X-ray]] (or [[cardiac CT]] or [[Cardiac MRI|MRI]]) and [[echocardiography]]. [[Biopsies]] from [[cardiac muscle|cardiac]] and [[skeletal muscle]] will show the presence of [[lipid]] and [[glycogen]]. testing for mitochondrial abnormalities, ANT deficiency and decreases of [[respiratory chain]] complexes I and IV can also be done. 

===Differential diagnosis===

* Isolated ATP synthase deficiency
* [[Barth syndrome]]
* TMEM70 deficiency

==Treatment==

Surgery for the cataracts may be needed. Medical treatment for the cardiac failure will be required. Treatment is otherwise supportive. 

==Prognosis==

About half the patients die within the first year of life. Because of its rarity the prognosis for the chronic form is not well established but survivial into adulthood has been reported.

==History==

This condition was first described in 1975.&lt;ref name=Sengers1975&gt;Sengers RCA, ter Haar, BGA, Trijbels JMF, Willems JL, Daniels O, Stadhouders AM (1975) Congenital cataract and mitochondrial myopathy of skeletal and heart muscle associated with lactic acidosis after exercise.

A popular uprising in [[Sevastopol]] in 1830 in response to strict [[quarantine]] measures imposed upon the city to combat the spread of the [[plague (disease)|plague]].

== Beginnings ==
In 1828, there was a plague in the southern part of the [[Russian Empire]], which was then [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)|at war]] with The [[Ottoman Empire]]. Even though there was no plague in Sevastopol, a quarantine was called as a preventative measure, likely due to the city's strategic importance as a port for the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Navy]].

In May 1828, a quarantine cordon was built around Sevastopol, and all traffic into and out of the city had to pass through a [[security checkpoint|checkpoint]]. In the summer of 1829, the quarantine was made stricter, such that anyone travelling to the city had to spend 2–3 weeks in the quarantine zone. Anybody suspected of illness had to be put into isolation. This dissuaded local farmers from entering the city with goods. This led to a shortage of rations, which was compounded by hoarding of goods by quarantine officials.

The deficit and poor quality of the goods in the city contributed to illness and death amongst the population, and the effects were the most pronounced in the poorer parts of the city.

Matters got so bad that an official commission was ordered from [[St. Petersburg]] to investigate the situation. Mass abuses were found, but no officials were punished and the commission was disbanded in November of that same year.

== Uprising ==
In March 1830, the quarantine was toughened further when all of the residents were ordered not to leave their homes. This ban was lifted in May, except for those residents of the poorer Korablenaya neighborhood, who were ordered to remain in quarantine for another 7 days, and upon passage of this week, for another 2 weeks. This enraged those residents, as well as their relations outside of the neighbourhood, and they refused the orders - despite the urging of [[Counter admiral]] [[Ivan Skalovsky]] and others in the military and religious establishment.

The quarantine was enforced by the infantry, and the desperate residents began planning an armed resistance, led by retired military amongst them. Many within the infantry sympathised with the residents. The two sides managed to avoid the outbreak of an armed confrontation.

On the 3rd of June, Lt. General and Military Governor of Sevastopol, [[Nikolai Stolypin]], in response to the growing instability, positioned troops in the streets and around the governor's mansion. This further incensed the revolting residents, who descended upon the governor's mansion in an angry mob and murdered Stolypin.

They were supported by the military garrisons deployed to enforce the quarantine, some of these soldiers tore down the quarantine cordon around the neighbourhood. The revolting citizens and soldiers held control of the city for 22 hours, during which time they ordered 'plague' officials to sign written documents stating that there was no plague in the city.

The next day Lt. Gen. [[Andrei Turchaninov]] replaced the murdered Stolypin and signed a decree ordering the end of the quarantine.

Despite accomplishing their immediate goal, the revolters did face repercussions when a division under Timofeyev{{who|date=December 2015}} arrived to regain control of the city. A committee under the governor of [[Novorossiya]], [[Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov]], considered the cases of about 6,000 people. 7 people were executed for leading the uprising and about 1,000 residents and sailors were sent to hard labor. Approximately 4,200 civilians were deported to other cities. The officers received disciplinary punishment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9846">'''The Seven Stones reef''' is a rocky [[reef]] nearly {{convert|15|mi}} west-northwest (WNW) of [[Land's End]], [[Cornwall]] and {{convert|7|mi}} east-northeast (ENE) of the [[Isles of Scilly]]. The reef consists of two groups of rocks and is nearly {{convert|2|mi}} long and {{convert|1|mi}} in breadth. They rise out of deep water and are a [[navigation]]al hazard for shipping with 71 named wrecks and an estimated 200 [[shipwrecks]] overall.  The most infamous is the ''[[Torrey Canyon]]'' in 1967, which was at that time the world's costliest shipping disaster, and to date, still the worst oil spill on the coast of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="larn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Larn|first=Richard|title=Shipwreck Index of the British Isles|year=1997|publisher=Lloyd's Register of Shipping|location=London|author2=Larn Bridget }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Sevenstones Lightship|Sevenstones lightvessel]] has been situated to the east of the reef since 1841, to warn ships of the danger and to mark the western boundary of a major north/south shipping route between the Isles of Scilly and the Cornish coast. An [[automatic weather station]] is on the lightvessel.

==Geography==
Situated between Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, the Seven Stones reef consists of seven (or eight) peaks, some of which appear at half ebb and others at low tide. They rise out of deep water, at {{convert|60|fathom|m||abbr=on}} and extend nearly two miles from north-northwest (NNW) to south-southeast (SSE) and are about a mile wide.&lt;ref name=Noall&gt;{{cite book |last=Noall |first=Cyril |title=Cornish Lights and Shipwrecks |year=1968 |publisher=D Bradford Barton |location=Truro |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sea always breaks over the reef and in good weather, [[Breaker (reef)|breakers]] are visible up to {{convert|12|mi}} away. The rocks consists of small-grained [[granite]] which is part of the larger [[Cornubian batholith]]. The batholith formed during the early [[Permian]] period, from about 300 to 275 [[myr|Ma]], at a late stage in the [[Variscan orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=J W F|title=Interpretations of seismic and gravity surveys over the eastern part of the Cornubian platform|journal=The Geological Society Special Publication|year=1984|volume=14|pages=119–124|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/14/1/119.abstract|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the stones have been given names and include Flat Ledge, Flemish Ledges, North-east Rocks, Pollard's Rock, South Rock and a ledge known as the Town.&lt;ref name=larn92/&gt;

During the 1960s the reef was fished by a small fleet of French fishing vessels for [[crab]], [[crayfish]] and [[lobster]]. Some of these vessels were the first on the scene when the ''Torrey Canyon'' sank in 1967.&lt;ref name=Petrow&gt;{{cite book|last=Petrow|first=Richard|title=The Black Tide. In the Wake of Torrey Canyon|year=1968|publisher=Hodder and Stroughton|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the vertical surfaces of the more exposed rocks there are clusters of [[Sea anemones|jewel anemones]] and [[Hydroid (zoology)|hydroids]], and [[plumose anemone]]s.&lt;ref name=liddiard&gt;{{cite web |last=Liddiard |first=John |title=Seven Stones |url=http://www.jlunderwater.co.uk/old_site/photoix/seven_stones/index.htm |website= |accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shipwrecks==
{{main|List of shipwrecks of the Seven Stones Reef}}
The reef is a major hazard to shipping as it is on the western boundary of a major north/south shipping route between the Cornish coast and the Isles of Scilly. The lightvessel, which has been on site since 1841, is {{convert|2.5|mi}} to the north-east, not on the reef, a safety measure, as the sea is less rough away from the reef and also to ensure passing ships give the reef a wide berth. It is estimated that there are over 200 shipwrecks although only 71 are named.&lt;ref name=larn92&gt;{{cite book|last=Larn|first=Richard|title=The Shipwrecks of the Isles of Scilly|year=1992|publisher=Thomas &amp; Lochar|location=[[Nairn]]|isbn=0 946537 84 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded wreck was in early March 1656. Two English [[Men-of-war|men o'war]], the ''Primrose'' and ''Mayflower'', were searching for two [[Spain|Spanish]] [[frigates]] which had been patrolling the area and had captured a [[Bristol]] bound vessel. The [[Sixth-rate|sixth rate]], 22 gun man o'war, ''Primrose'' lost her main [[topmast]] near the [[Longships]], off [[Land’s End]] and drifted onto the Seven Stones. She managed to free herself and later sank in {{convert|60|fathom|m||abbr=on}} taking sixteen men, two women and a child with her. At the investigation into the loss, [[Trinity House]], on behalf of the [[Admiralty]], stated that they could not find any chart that showed the reef. The Admiralty found that there was no neglect either by the Officers or company, the place of wreck being a rock not visible nor described in any chart they could find.&lt;ref name=larn92/&gt; The largest loss of life was on 27 February 1748 with the sinking of the fourteen gun [[sloop]] HMS ''Lizard'' which was wrecked with the loss of over one hundred crew.&lt;ref name=larn92/&gt;

On 18 March 1967 the world’s first major oil pollution incident occurred when a [[supertanker]], the ''Torrey Canyon'' hit the Pollard’s Rock, tearing a {{convert|610|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} gash in her side and spilling 860,000 barrels of oil into the sea. Westerly winds and currents caused the oil to pollute {{convert|120|mi}} of the Cornish coast and {{convert|50|mi}} of the [[Brittany]] coast. She now lies in {{convert|98|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} of water. Large amounts of toxic [[detergent]] was sprayed on the oil in an attempt to disperse it and, along with the oil, accounted for the loss of much of the marine life and 15,000 birds.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Robin|title=Lighthouses of the South West|year=2011|publisher=Halgroves|location=Wellington, Somerset|isbn=978 0 85704 107 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was the world's costliest shipping disaster, and to date, still the worst oil spill on the coast of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=larn92/&gt;

==Seven Stones lightvessel==
{{main|Sevenstones Lightship}}
The government was first petitioned for a light on the reef in 1826 (with no success), and a second petition in 1839 was supported by the British Channel ports, Liverpool merchants and the Chamber of Commerce of [[Waterford]]. A meeting held on 21 February 1840 in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] declared the reef would shorten the route around the Isles of Scilly by up to 36 hours, and on 31 July 1841 a [[lightvessel]] (also known as a lightship) was seen at nearby St Mary's, Isles of Scilly.&lt;ref name=Noall/&gt; 

A lightvessel was first moored near the reef on 20 August 1841 and exhibited its first light on 1 September 1841. She is permanently anchored in {{convert|40|fathom|m||abbr=on}} and is {{convert|2.5|mi}} north-east (NE) of the reef.&lt;ref name=Noall/&gt;&lt;ref name=Petrow/&gt; Just over a year later on 25 November 1842 her cable parted and she almost became a wreck when she drove over the reef at high tide. The crew steered the ship to [[New Grimsby]], [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] where she stayed until 6 January 1843. She broke adrift again that January and went over the reef a second time the following March. Two of the crew drowned on 15 October 1851 when one of the lightship's longboats capsized, in a squall, on a journey from Scilly with stores.&lt;ref name=larn92/&gt; A [[meteor]] exploded over the lightvessel, at 2 am on 13 November 1872, showering the deck with cinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven Stones Lightvessel|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=902|publisher=Engineering Timelines|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was replaced with a lighted [[buoy]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] after being frequently bombed and machine-gunned by [[Germany|German]] [[Pilot (aircraft)|pilots]].&lt;ref name=Petrow/&gt; 

Since 1987, the ship has been automated and unmanned with the accommodation and storage areas filled with foam to help with buoyancy in the event of a collision.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;

The Seven Stones lightvessel also acts as an automatic weather station.&lt;ref name=liddiard/&gt;

==Folklore==
{{main|Lyonesse}}
There is a legend, part of the [[King Arthur]] scenario, that there was once a land between Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, known as [[Lyonesse]], with several towns and 140 churches. In the legend it was flooded and became sea. Only one man survived, Trevelyan, who riding on a black horse managed to reach dry land. The area is also part of [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian]] legend when [[Merlin]] cast a spell to engulf the land and the forces of [[Mordred]] who were chasing the fleeing army of [[King Arthur]] who he had just slain in battle. Arthur’s supporters managed to reach high ground in the Isles of Scilly. Fishermen are said to be able to hear the sound of church bells.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;

{{Sexual orientation}}
'''Sexual relationship disorder''' is a disorder where a person has difficulties in forming or maintaining a sexual relationship because of their [[gender identity]] or [[sexual orientation]].  The [[World Health Organization]] lists sexual relationship disorder in the [[ICD-10]], under "Psychological and behavioural disorders associated with sexual development and orientation".  The WHO describes it thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The gender identity or sexual orientation (heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual) is responsible for difficulties in forming or maintaining a relationship with a sexual partner. ({{ICD10|F|66|2|f|60}})&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The WHO applies the following note to the entirety of part F66: "Sexual orientation by itself is not to be regarded as a disorder."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf60.htm+f661 ICD-10]: See part F66.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of men and women experience conflict surrounding homosexual expression within a [[mixed-orientation marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolf TJ |title=Group psychotherapy for bisexual men and their wives |journal=J. Homosex. |volume=14 |issue=1-2 |pages=191–9 |year=1987 |pmid=3655341 |doi=10.1300/J082v14n01_14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therapy may include helping the client feel more comfortable and accepting of same-sex feelings and to explore ways of incorporating same-sex and opposite-sex feelings into life patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Coleman E |title=Bisexual and gay men in heterosexual marriage: conflicts and resolutions in therapy |journal=J. Homosex. |volume=7 |issue=2-3 |pages=93–103 |year=1981 |pmid=7346553 |doi=10.1300/J082v07n02_11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a strong homosexual identity was associated with difficulties in marital satisfaction, viewing the same-sex activities as compulsive facilitated commitment to the marriage and to monogamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schneider JP, Schneider BH |title=Marital satisfaction during recovery from self-identified sexual addiction among bisexual men and their wives |journal=J Sex Marital Ther. |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=230–50 |year=1990 |pmid=2079706 |doi=10.1080/00926239008405460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other LGBT people may want to have a family with an opposite-sex spouse.  They may seek to [[sexual orientation change efforts|change their sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rosik CH |title=Motivational, ethical, and epistemological foundations in the treatment of unwanted homoerotic attraction |journal=J Marital Fam Ther. |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=13–28 |date=Jan 2003 |pmid=12616795 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-0606.2003.tb00379.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research from the 1970s showed that a minority of patients who undergo therapy ultimately married someone of the opposite sex, though it is not clear what role therapy contributed to the marriage.  Recent research does not permit any attribution of marital outcomes to therapy, though it appears that sexual orientation identity reconstruction can help clients develop a heterosexual orientation identity.&lt;ref name=apa&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf Report of the American Psychological Association Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4046">'''Sid the Slug''' is an [[advertising]] character employed by the [[Food Standards Agency]] (FSA) in the [[United Kingdom]] as the face of the "Salt - Watch it" campaign to warn the public of the risks of excessive [[Edible salt|salt]] consumption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adforum.com/creative-work/ad/player/51764/sid-the-slug/food-standards-agency&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[multimedia]] campaign, including advertising [[Billboard|hoardings]], [[television commercial]]s and [[Internet]] coverage, was based on the premise that salt kills [[slug]]s, and can harm humans too. The campaign infuriated the [[Salt Manufacturers' Association]] (SMA), who complained to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Salt Manufacturers' Association]] press release [http://www.saltsense.co.uk/releases/rel004.htm ‘Squash Slug’ Says Salt Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909080047/http://www.saltsense.co.uk/releases/rel004.htm |date=2006-09-09 }} 20 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; - their complaint being that the information presented was misleading. The [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] did not uphold the SMA complaint in its adjudication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/EFB31ED5-A00D-4AE7-8988-F69B20DF8C6D/0/Broadcast_rulings_20_April_05.pdf Broadcast Advertising Adjudications: 20 April 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326202238/http://www.asa.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/EFB31ED5-A00D-4AE7-8988-F69B20DF8C6D/0/Broadcast_rulings_20_April_05.pdf |date=26 March 2009 }} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ASA had to deal with another complaint from a member of the public, that the use of the name "Sid" was offensive; this was also rejected, with the ASA instead arguing that most people would find it "[[humour|humorous]]".&lt;ref&gt;BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3736306.stm Salt advert complaint rejected] 12 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the public complained to the FSA that the Welsh subtitles in the ‘Sid the Slug’ TV advertisements meant the FSA was not treating English and Welsh equally, as is required by the FSA Welsh Language Scheme. The FSA replied that the animation could not have been dubbed into Welsh successfully, hence the subtitles. However, the FSA accepted that it had not complied with advertising conduct, as set by the [[Welsh Language Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Food Standards Agency]] [http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/complaints2004/5.pdf Complaints Received by the FSA in 2004 - 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sleep in non-human animals''' refers to a behavioral and physiological state characterized by altered consciousness, reduced responsiveness to external stimuli, and homeostatic regulation. [[Sleep]] is observed in mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and some fish, and, in some form, in insects and even in simpler animals such as [[nematode]]s. The internal [[circadian clock]] promotes sleep at night for diurnal organisms (such as humans) and in the day for nocturnal organisms (such as rodents). Sleep patterns vary widely among species. It appears to be a requirement for all mammals and most other animals.

==Definition==
{{Dormancy}}
Sleep can follow a [[physiological]] or [[behavior]]al definition. In the physiological sense, sleep is a state characterized by reversible unconsciousness, special [[brain activity|brainwave]] patterns, sporadic eye movement, loss of [[muscle tone]] (possibly with some exceptions; see below regarding the sleep of birds and of aquatic mammals), and a compensatory increase following deprivation{{clarify|date=March 2016}} of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Rechtschaffen A, Kales A (1968): A Manual of Standardised Terminology, Techniques and Scoring System of Sleep Stages of Human Subjects; Public Health Service, Government Printing Office, Washington. Iber C, Ancoli-Israel S, Chesson A Jr, Quan S (2007): AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events: Rules, Terminology and Technical Specification; American Association of Sleep Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt; In the behavioral sense, sleep is characterized by minimal movement, non-responsiveness to external stimuli (i.e. increased [[sensory threshold]]), the adoption of a typical posture, and the occupation of a sheltered site, all of which is usually repeated on a 24-hour basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meddis R |title=On the function of sleep |journal=Anim Behav |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=676–91 |date=August 1975 |pmid=169715 |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(75)90144-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological definition applies well to birds and mammals, but in other animals (whose brain is not as complex), the behavioral definition is more often used. In very simple animals, behavioral definitions of sleep are the only ones possible, and even then the behavioral repertoire of the animal may not be extensive enough to allow distinction between sleep and wakefulness.&lt;ref name="Nicolau"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicolau MC, Akaârir M, Gamundí A, González J, Rial RV |title=Why we sleep: the evolutionary pathway to the mammalian sleep |journal=Prog.

Sleep is quickly reversible, as opposed to hibernation or [[coma]], and sleep deprivation is followed by longer or deeper rebound sleep.

== Necessity ==
If sleep were not essential, one would expect to find:
* Animal species that do not sleep at all
* Animals that do not need recovery sleep after staying awake longer than usual
* Animals that suffer no serious consequences as a result of lack of sleep
Outside of a few [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] animals that have no brain or a very simple one, no animals have been found to date that satisfy any of these criteria.&lt;ref name=Tononi2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cirelli C, Tononi G | title = Is Sleep Essential? | journal = PLoS Biol | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | page = e216 | date = 26 August 2008 | pmid = 18752355 | pmc = 2525690 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0060216 | publisher = Public Library of Science | quote = ... it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep, particularly at the cellular level, remains a worthwhile exercise }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some varieties of shark, such as great whites and hammerheads, must remain in motion at all times to move oxygenated water over their gills, it is possible they still sleep one cerebral hemisphere at a time as marine mammals do. However it remains to be shown definitively whether any fish is capable of [[Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep|unihemispheric sleep]]{{Citation needed|reason=The article of Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep doesn't mention about sharks have such behavior.If this statement can be cited,please do the same in the Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep article.|date=February 2018}}.

==Invertebrates==

Sleep as a phenomenon appears to have very old evolutionary roots. Unicellular organisms do not necessarily "sleep", although many of them have pronounced circadian rhythms. The jellyfish [[Cassiopea]] is the most primitive organism in which sleep-like states have been observed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.com/news/jellyfish-caught-snoozing-give-clues-to-origin-of-sleep-1.22654 Jellyfish caught snoozing give clues to origin of sleep : Nature News]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[nematode]] ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' is another primitive organism that appears to require sleep. Here, a ''[[fatigue (medical)|lethargus]]'' phase occurs in short periods preceding each [[ecdysis|moult]], a fact which may indicate that sleep primitively is connected to developmental processes. Raizen ''et al.'''s results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Raizen DM |title=Lethargus is a Caenorhabditis elegans sleep-like state |journal=Nature |volume=451 |issue=7178 |pages=569–72 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18185515 |doi=10.1038/nature06535 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Zimmerman JE |author3=Maycock MH |display-authors=3 |last4=Ta |first4=Uyen D. |last5=You |first5=Young-jai |last6=Sundaram |first6=Meera V. |last7=Pack |first7=Allan I.|bibcode=2008Natur.451..569R }}&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore suggest that sleep is necessary for changes in the neural system.

The [[electrophysiological]] study of sleep in small [[invertebrate]]s is complicated. Insects go through circadian rhythms of activity and passivity but some do not seem to have a homeostatic sleep need. Insects do not seem to exhibit REM sleep. However, [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] appear to sleep, and systematic disturbance of that state leads to [[cognition|cognitive disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huber | first1 = R | last2 = Hill | first2 = SL | last3 = Holladay | first3 = C | last4 = Biesiadecki | first4 = M | last5 = Tononi | first5 = G | last6 = Cirelli | first6 = C | year = 2005 | title = Sleep Homeostasis in Drosophila Melanogaster; | url = | journal = Sleep | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 628–639 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several methods of measuring cognitive functions in fruit flies. A common method is to let the flies choose whether they want to fly through a tunnel that leads to a light source, or through a dark tunnel. Normally, flies are attracted to light. But if [[sugar]] is placed in the end of the dark tunnel, and something the flies dislike is placed in the end of the light tunnel, the flies will eventually learn to fly towards darkness rather than light. Flies deprived of sleep require a longer time to learn this and also forget it more quickly. If an [[arthropod]] is experimentally kept awake longer than it is used to, then its coming rest period will be prolonged. In [[cockroach]]es that rest period is characterized by the [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] being folded down and by a decreased sensitivity to external stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tobler I, Neuner-Jehle M |title=24-h variation of vigilance in the cockroach Blaberus giganteus |journal=J Sleep Res |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=231–239 |date=December 1992 |pmid=10607056 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2869.1992.tb00044.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleep has been described in [[crayfish]], too, characterized by passivity and increased thresholds for sensory stimuli as well as changes in the [[EEG]] pattern, markedly differing from the patterns found in crayfish when they are awake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ramón | first1 = F | last2 = Hernández-Falcón | first2 = J | last3 = Nguyen | first3 = B | last4 = Bullock | first4 = TH | year = 2004 | title = Slow wave sleep in crayfish; | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 101 | issue = 32| pages = 11857–11861 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0402015101| pmc = 511064 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..10111857R | pmid=15286285}}&lt;/ref&gt; In honeybees, it has been suggested they could be able to dream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160621-do-bees-dream BBC - Earth - Bees learn while they sleep, and that means they might dream]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land vertebrates ==
Mammals, birds and reptiles evolved from amniotic ancestors, the first vertebrates with life cycles independent of water. The fact that birds and mammals are the only known animals to exhibit REM and NREM sleep indicates a common trait before divergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Low PS, Shank SS, Sejnowski TJ, Margoliash D | title = Mammalian-like features of sleep structure in zebra finches | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 26 | pages = 9081–9086 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18579776 | pmc = 2440357 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0703452105 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.9081L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reptiles are therefore the most logical group to investigate the origins of sleep. Daytime activity in reptiles alternates between basking and short bouts of active behavior, which has significant neurological and physiological similarities to sleep states in mammals. It is proposed that REM sleep evolved from short bouts of motor activity in reptiles while SWS evolved from their basking state which shows similar slow wave EEG patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rial RV, Akaârir M, Gamundí A, Nicolau C, Garau C, Aparicio S, Tejada S, Gené L, González J, De Vera LM, Coenen AM, Barceló P, Esteban S | title = Evolution of wakefulness, sleep and hibernation: From reptiles to mammals | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 34 | issue = 8 | pages = 1144–1160 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20109487 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.01.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reptile]]s have quiescent periods similar to mammalian sleep, and a decrease in electrical activity in the brain has been registered when the animals have been asleep. However, the EEG pattern in reptilian sleep differs from what is seen in [[mammal]]s and other animals.&lt;ref name="Nicolau"/&gt; In reptiles, sleep time increases following [[sleep deprivation]], and stronger stimuli are needed to awaken the animals when they have been deprived of sleep as compared to when they have slept normally. This suggests that the sleep which follows deprivation is compensatorily deeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Flanigan WF |title=Sleep and wakefulness in iguanid lizards, Ctenosaura pectinata and Iguana iguana |journal=Brain Behav.

There are significant similarities between sleep in [[bird]]s and sleep in mammals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rattenborg | first1 = NC | year = 2006 | title = Evolution of slow-wave sleep and palliopallial connectivity in mammals and birds: a hypothesis | url = | journal = Brain Res Bull | volume = 69 | issue = 1| pages = 20–29 | doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2005.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is one of the reasons for the idea that sleep in higher animals with its division into [[REM sleep|REM]] and [[NREM sleep]] has [[evolved]] together with [[warm-blooded]]ness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kavanau | first1 = JL | year = 2002 | title = REM and NREM sleep as natural accompaniments of the evolution of warm-bloodedness | url = | journal = [[Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews]] | volume = 26 | issue = 8| pages = 889–906 | doi=10.1016/s0149-7634(02)00088-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds compensate for sleep loss in a manner similar to mammals, by deeper or more intense SWS ([[slow-wave sleep]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martinez-Gonzalez |first=Dolores |author2=John A.

Birds have both REM and NREM sleep, and the EEG patterns of both have similarities to those of mammals. Different birds sleep different amounts, but the associations seen in mammals between sleep and variables such as body mass, brain mass, relative brain mass, [[basal metabolic rate|basal metabolism]] and other factors (see below) are not found in birds. The only clear explanatory factor for the variations in sleep amounts for birds of different species is that birds who sleep in environments where they are exposed to [[predation|predators]] have less deep sleep than birds sleeping in more protected environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roth | first1 = TC II | last2 = Lesku | first2 = JA | last3 = Amlander | first3 = CJ | last4 = Lima | first4 = SL | year = 2006 | title = A phylogenetic analysis of the correlates of sleep in birds | url = | journal = J Sleep Res | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 395–402 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2869.2006.00559.x| pmid = 17118096 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Flamingo fg01.jpg|thumb|left|225px|A [[flamingo]] with at least one cerebral hemisphere awake]]
Birds do not necessarily exhibit sleep debt, but a peculiarity that birds share with aquatic mammals, and possibly also with certain species of [[lizard]]s (opinions differ about that last point), is the ability for unihemispheric sleep. That is the ability to sleep with one [[cerebral hemisphere]] at a time, while the other hemisphere is awake ([[Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rattenborg | first1 = NC | last2 = Amlaner | first2 = CJ | last3 = Lima | first3 = SL | year = 2000 | title = Behavioral, neurophysiological and evolutionary perspectives on unihemispheric sleep; | url = | journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev | volume = 24 | issue = 8| pages = 817–42 | doi=10.1016/s0149-7634(00)00039-7 | pmid=11118608}}&lt;/ref&gt; When only one hemisphere is sleeping, only the contralateral eye will be shut; that is, when the right hemisphere is asleep the left eye will be shut, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rattenborg | first1 = NC | last2 = Amlaner | first2 = CJ | last3 = Lima | first3 = SL | year = 2001 | title = Unilateral eye closure and interhemispheric EEG asymmetry during sleep in the pigeon (Columba livia); | url = | journal = Brain Behav Evol | volume = 58 | issue = 6| pages = 323–32 | doi=10.1159/000057573| pmid = 12016351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of sleep between the two hemispheres and the amount of unihemispheric sleep are determined both by which part of the brain has been the most active during the previous period of wake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mascetti | first1 = GG | last2 = Rugger | first2 = M | last3 = Vallortigara | first3 = G | last4 = Bobbo | first4 = D | year = 2007 | title = Monocular-unihemispheric sleep and visual discrimination learning in the domestic chick; | url = | journal = Exp Brain Res | volume = 176 | issue = 1| pages = 70–84 | doi=10.1007/s00221-006-0595-3| pmid = 16874518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—that part will sleep the deepest—and it is also determined by the risk of attacks from predators. [[Ducks]] near the perimeter of the flock are likely to be the ones that first will detect predator attacks. These ducks have significantly more unihemispheric sleep than those who sleep in the middle of the flock, and they react to threatening stimuli seen by the open eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rattenborg | first1 = NC | last2 = Lima | first2 = SL | last3 = Amlaner | first3 = CJ | year = 1999 | title = Facultative control of avian unihemispheric sleep under the risk of predation | url = | journal = Behav Brain Res | volume = 105 | issue = 2| pages = 163–72 | doi=10.1016/s0166-4328(99)00070-4| pmid = 10563490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions partly differ about sleep in [[migratory bird]]s. The controversy is mainly about whether they can sleep while flying or not. Theoretically, certain types of sleep could be possible while flying, but technical difficulties preclude the recording of brain activity in birds while they are flying.

==Mammals==
[[File:Japanese Macaques sleeping.JPG|thumb|Sleeping [[Japanese macaque]]s.]]
Mammals have wide diversity in sleep phenomena. Generally, they go through periods of alternating non-REM and REM sleep, but these manifest differently. Horses and other herbivorous [[ungulate]]s can sleep while standing, but must necessarily lie down for REM sleep (which causes muscular atony) for short periods. Giraffes, for example, only need to lie down for REM sleep for a few minutes at a time. Bats sleep while hanging upside down. Inversely to humans and rats, male armadillos get erections during non-REM sleep.&lt;ref name=Siegel2008&gt;{{cite journal | author = Siegel Jerome M | year = 2008 | title = Do all animals sleep? | url = | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 208–13 | doi=10.1016/j.tins.2008.02.001| pmid = 18328577 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early mammals engaged in polyphasic sleep, dividing sleep into multiple bouts per day. Higher daily sleep quotas and shorter sleep cycles in polyphasic species as compared to monophasic species, suggest that polyphasic sleep may be a less efficient means of attaining sleep’s benefits. Small species with higher BMR may therefore have less efficient sleep patterns. It follows that the evolution of monophasic sleep may hitherto be an unknown advantage of evolving larger mammalian body sizes and therefore lower BMR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Capellini I, Nunn CL, McNamara P, Preston BT, Barton RA | title = Energetic constraints, not predation, influence the evolution of sleep patterning in mammals | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 847–853 | year = 2008 | pmid = 20428321 | pmc = 2860325 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01449.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sleep is sometimes thought to help conserve energy, though this theory is not fully adequate as it only decreases metabolism by about 5–10%.&lt;ref name="syllabus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sleephomepages.org/sleepsyllabus/b.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050318204532/http://www.sleephomepages.org/sleepsyllabus/b.html |archivedate=2005-03-18 |title=Sleep Syllabus.

Different [[mammal]]s sleep different amounts. Some, such as [[bat]]s, sleep 18–20 hours per day, while others, including [[giraffe]]s, sleep only 3–4 hours per day. There can be big differences even between closely related species. There can also be differences between laboratory and field studies: for example, researchers in 1983 reported that captive [[sloth]]s slept nearly 16 hours a day, but in 2008, when miniature neurophysiological recorders were developed that could be affixed to wild animals, sloths in nature were found to sleep only 9.6 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rattenborg | first1 = N.C. | last2 = Voirin | first2 = B. | last3 = Vyssotski | first3 = A.L. | last4 = Kays | first4 = R.W. | last5 = Spoelstra | first5 = K. | last6 = Kuemmeth | first6 = F. | last7 = Heidrich | first7 = W. | last8 = Wikelski | first8 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Sleeping outside the box: electroencephalographic measures of sleep in sloths inhabiting a rainforest | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 402–405 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2008.0203 | pmid=18482903 | pmc=2610152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with birds, the main rule for mammals (with certain exceptions, see below) is that they have two essentially different stages of sleep: REM and NREM sleep (see above). Mammals' feeding habits are associated with their sleep length. The daily need for sleep is highest in [[carnivore]]s, lower in [[omnivore]]s and lowest in [[herbivore]]s. Humans sleep less than many other omnivores but otherwise not unusually much or unusually little in comparison with other mammals.&lt;ref name="Siegel (2005)"/&gt; Many herbivores, like [[Ruminantia]] (such as cattle), spend much of their wake time in a state of drowsiness,{{explain|date=March 2016}} which perhaps could partly explain their relatively low need for sleep. In herbivores, an inverse correlation is apparent between body mass and sleep length; big mammals sleep less than smaller ones. This correlation is thought to explain about 25% of the difference in sleep amount between different mammals.&lt;ref name="Siegel (2005)"/&gt; Also, the length of a particular sleep cycle is associated with the size of the animal; on average, bigger animals will have sleep cycles of longer durations than smaller animals. Sleep amount is also coupled to factors like [[basal metabolism]], brain mass, and relative brain mass.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The duration of sleep among species is also directly related to [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR). Rats, which have a high BMR, sleep for up to 14 hours a day, whereas elephants and giraffes, which have lower BMRs, sleep only 3–4 hours per day.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

It has been suggested that mammalian species which invest in longer sleep times are investing in the immune system, as species with the longer sleep times have higher white blood cell counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Opp MR | title = Sleeping to fuel the immune system: mammalian sleep and resistance to parasites | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 9 | pages = 1471–2148 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19134176 | pmc = 2633283 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-9-8 | publisher = BioMed Central Ltd. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mammals born with well-developed regulatory systems, such as the horse and giraffe, tend to have less [[REM sleep]] than the species which are less developed at birth, such as cats and rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sleep Syllabus |work= Basics of Sleep Behavior |url= http://www.sleephomepages.org/sleepsyllabus/b.html |accessdate= 2008-04-16 |author= The Sleep Research Society |location= United States |year= 1997 |publisher= WebSciences International and Sleep Research Society |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050318204532/http://www.sleephomepages.org/sleepsyllabus/b.html |archivedate= 2005-03-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to echo the greater need for REM sleep among newborns than among adults in most mammal species.

Reasons given for the wide variations include the fact that mammals "that nap in hiding, like bats or rodents tend to have longer, deeper snoozes than those on constant alert." Lions, which have little fear of predators also have relatively long sleep periods, while elephants have to eat most of the time to support their huge bodies. Little brown bats conserve their energy except for the few hours each night when their insect prey are available, and platypuses eat a high energy [[crustacean]] diet and, therefore, probably do not need to spend as much time awake as many other mammals.&lt;ref name="WinksJennifer"&gt;Holland, Jennifer S.

A study conducted by Datta indirectly supports the idea that memory benefits from sleep.&lt;ref name="Datta S 2000 8607–8613"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Datta S | title = Avoidance task training potentiates phasic pontine-wave density in the rat: A mechanism for sleep-dependent plasticity | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 20 | issue = 22 | pages = 8607–8613 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11069969 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A box was constructed wherein a single rat could move freely from one end to the other. The bottom of the box was made of a steel grate. A light would shine in the box accompanied by a sound. After a five-second delay, an electrical shock would be applied. Once the shock commenced, the rat could move to the other end of the box, ending the shock immediately. The rat could also use the five-second delay to move to the other end of the box and avoid the shock entirely. The length of the shock never exceeded five seconds. This was repeated 30 times for half the rats. The other half, the control group, was placed in the same trial, but the rats were shocked regardless of their reaction. After each of the training sessions, the rat would be placed in a recording cage for six hours of polygraphic recordings. This process was repeated for three consecutive days. During the posttrial sleep recording session, rats spent 25.47% more time in REM sleep after learning trials than after control trials.&lt;ref name="Datta S 2000 8607–8613"/&gt;

An observation of the Datta study is that the learning group spent 180% more time in SWS than did the control group during the post-trial sleep-recording session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kudrimoti HS, Barnes CA, McNaughton BL | title = Reactivation of hippocampal cell assemblies: Effects of behavioral state, experience, and EEG dynamics | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 19 | issue = 10 | pages = 4090–4101 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10234037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study shows that after spatial exploration activity, patterns of [[hippocampal]] place cells are reactivated during SWS following the experiment. Rats were run through a linear track using rewards on either end. The rats would then be placed in the track for 30 minutes to allow them to adjust (PRE), then they ran the track with reward-based training for 30 minutes (RUN), and then they were allowed to rest for 30 minutes.

During each of these three periods, [[EEG]] data were collected for information on the rats' sleep stages. The mean firing rates of hippocampal place cells during prebehavior SWS (PRE) and three ten-minute intervals in postbehavior SWS (POST) were calculated by averaging across 22 track-running sessions from seven rats. The results showed that ten minutes after the trial RUN session, there was a 12% increase in the mean firing rate of hippocampal place cells from the PRE level. After 20 minutes, the mean firing rate returned rapidly toward the PRE level. The elevated firing of hippocampal place cells during SWS after spatial exploration could explain why there were elevated levels of slow-wave sleep in Datta's study, as it also dealt with a form of spatial exploration.

In rats, sleep deprivation causes weight loss and reduced body temperature.

A 2014 study found that depriving mice of sleep increased cancer growth and dampened the immune system's ability to control cancers.  The researchers found higher levels of M2 [[tumor-associated macrophage]]s and [[TLR4]] molecules in the sleep deprived mice and proposed this as the mechanism for increased susceptibility of the mice to cancer growth.  M2 cells suppress the immune system and encourage tumour growth.

===Monotremes===

Since [[monotreme]]s (egg-laying mammals) are considered to represent one of the evolutionarily oldest groups of mammals, they have been subject to special interest in the study of mammalian sleep. As early studies of these animals could not find clear evidence for REM sleep, it was initially assumed that such sleep did not exist in monotremes, but developed after the monotremes branched off from the rest of the mammalian evolutionary line, and became a separate, distinct group. However, [[EEG]] recordings of the [[brain stem]] in monotremes show a firing pattern that is quite similar to the patterns seen in REM sleep in higher mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siegel | first1 = JM | last2 = Manger | first2 = PR | last3 = Nienhuis | first3 = R | last4 = Fahringer | first4 = HM | last5 = Pettigrew | first5 = JD | year = 1996 | title = The echidna Tachyglossus aculeatus combines REM and non-REM aspects in a single sleep state: implications for the evolution of sleep; | url = | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 16 | issue = 10| pages = 3500–3506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siegel | first1 = JM | last2 = Manger | first2 = PR | last3 = Nienhuis | first3 = R | last4 = Fahringer | first4 = HM | last5 = Pettigrew | first5 = JD | year = 1998 | title = Monotremes and the evolution of rapid eye movement sleep | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1998.0272 | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 353 | issue = 1372| pages = 1147–1157 | pmc = 1692309 | pmid=9720111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the largest amount of REM sleep known in any animal is found in the [[platypus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Siegel |first=J.M. |author2=P.R.

The average sleep time of the platypus in a 24-hour period is said to be as long as 14 hours, though this may be because of their high-calorie [[crustacean]] diet.&lt;ref name="WinksJennifer" /&gt;

===Aquatic mammals===

The consequences of falling into a deep sleep for marine mammalian species can be suffocation and drowning, or becoming easy prey for predators. Thus, dolphins, whales, and [[pinniped]]s (seals) engage in unihemispheric sleep while swimming, which allows one brain hemisphere to remain fully functional, while the other goes to sleep. The hemisphere that is asleep alternates, so that both hemispheres can be fully rested.&lt;ref name="Hecker1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work= Oceana.org| title= Seals Sleep with Only Half of Their Brain at a Time| date=12 March 2013| url= http://oceana.org/en/blog/2013/03/seals-sleep-with-only-half-of-their-brain-at-a-time}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like terrestrial mammals, pinnipeds that sleep on land fall into a deep sleep and both hemispheres of their brain shut down and are in full sleep mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lapierre JL, Kosenko PO, Lyamin OI, Kodama T, Mukhametov LM, Siegel JM | title = Cortical Acetylcholine Release Is Lateralized during Asymmetrical Slow-Wave Sleep in Northern Fur Seals | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 44 | pages = 11999–12006 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17978041 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2968-07.2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Study Seals Sleep with Half Their Brain| url= http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2013/02/19/Study-Seals-sleep-with-half-their-brain/UPI-51691361307066/|work=upi.com|date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marine mammal|Aquatic mammal]] infants do not have REM sleep in infancy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why do we Sleep? |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2162475/entry/2162477/ |publisher=Slate.com |date=27 May 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2008 |author=Amanda Schaffer}}&lt;/ref&gt; REM sleep increases as they age.

Among others, [[pinniped|seals]] and [[whale]]s belong to the aquatic mammals. [[Earless seal]]s and [[eared seal]]s have solved the problem of sleeping in water via two different methods. Eared seals, like whales, show unihemispheric sleep. The sleeping half of the brain does not awaken when they surface to breathe. When one half of a seal's brain shows slow-wave sleep, the flippers and whiskers on its opposite side are immobile. While in the water, these seals have almost no REM sleep and may go a week or two without it. As soon as they move onto land they switch to bilateral REM sleep and NREM sleep comparable to land mammals, surprising researchers with their lack of "recovery sleep" after missing so much REM.

[[Image:Cape fur seal in Rostock.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Cape fur seal]], asleep in a zoo]]
Earless seals sleep bihemispherically like most mammals, under water, hanging at the water surface or on land. They hold their breath while sleeping under water, and wake up regularly to surface and breathe. They can also hang with their nostrils above water and in that position have REM sleep, but they do not have REM sleep underwater.

REM sleep has been observed in the [[pilot whale]], a species of dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Serafetinides | first1 = EA | last2 = Shurley | first2 = JT | last3 = Brooks | first3 = RE | year = 1972 | title = Electroencephalogram of the pilot whale, Globicephala scammoni, in wakefulness and sleep: lateralization aspects | url = | journal = Int J Psychobiol | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 129–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whales do not seem to have REM sleep, nor do they seem to have any problems because of this.

==Unihemispherism==
{{main|Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep}}
Unihemispheric sleep refers to sleeping with only a single [[cerebral hemisphere]]. The phenomenon has been observed in [[bird]]s and [[aquatic mammal]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mukhametov LM, Supin AY, Polyakova IG | title = Interhemispheric asymmetry of the electroencephalographic sleep patterns in dolphins | journal = Brain Research | volume = 134 | issue = 3 | pages = 581–584 | date = 14 October 1977 | pmid = 902119 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(77)90835-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in several reptilian species (the latter being disputed: many reptiles behave in a way which could be construed as unihemispheric sleeping, but [[EEG]] studies have given contradictory results). Reasons for the development of unihemispheric sleep are likely that it enables the sleeping animal to receive stimuli—threats, for instance—from its environment, and that it enables the animal to fly or periodically surface to breathe when immersed in water. Only NREM sleep exists unihemispherically, and there seems to exist a continuum in unihemispheric sleep regarding the differences in the hemispheres: in animals exhibiting unihemispheric sleep, conditions range from one hemisphere being in [[deep sleep]] with the other hemisphere being awake to one hemisphere sleeping lightly with the other hemisphere being awake. If one hemisphere is selectively deprived of sleep in an animal exhibiting unihemispheric sleep (one hemisphere is allowed to sleep freely but the other is awoken whenever it falls asleep), the amount of deep sleep will selectively increase in the hemisphere that was deprived of sleep when both hemispheres are allowed to sleep freely.

The [[neurobiological]] background for unihemispheric sleep is still unclear. In experiments on [[cat]]s in which the connection between the left and the right halves of the brain stem has been severed, the brain hemispheres show periods of a desynchronized EEG, during which the two hemispheres can sleep independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Michel |first=F. |author2=Roffwarg, H.P. |date=February 1967 |title=Chronic split brainstem preparation: effect on sleep–waking cycle |journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences (CMLS) (Experientia) |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=126–128 |publisher=Birkhäuser |location=Basel |doi=10.1007/BF02135958 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p740157114225327/ |language=French |format=Abstract |accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cats, the state where one hemisphere slept NREM and the other was awake, as well as one hemisphere sleeping NREM with the other state sleeping REM were observed. The cats were never seen to sleep REM sleep with one hemisphere while the other hemisphere was awake. This is in accordance with the fact that REM sleep, as far as is currently known, does not occur unihemispherically.

The fact that unihemispheric sleep exists has been used as an argument for the necessity of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cirelli | first = C |author2=G Tononi | year = 2008 | title = Is Sleep Essential?

==Hibernation==
Animals that [[hibernate]] are in a state of [[torpor]], differing from sleep. Hibernation markedly reduces the need for sleep, but does not remove it.

A '''smallholding''' is a small [[farm]]. In [[developing country|developing countries]], smallholdings are usually farms supporting a single family with a mixture of [[cash crop]]s and [[subsistence farming]]. As a country becomes more affluent, smallholdings may not be self-sufficient but are valued primarily for the rural lifestyle that they provide for the owners, who often do not earn their livelihood from the farm. There are an estimated 500 million smallholder farms in the world, supporting almost 2 billion people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifad.org/operations/food/farmer.htm|title=Operating model – ifad.org|website=www.ifad.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505224355/http://www.ifad.org/operations/food/farmer.htm|archivedate=2013-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today some companies try to include smallholdings into their [[Agricultural value chain|value chain]], providing seed, feed or fertilizer to improve production. Some say that this model shows benefits for both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Promising agribusiness |author=Christina Gradl|publisher=dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/smallholder-farmers-and-retailers-benefit-intelligently-designed-value-chains|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Smallholdings in Britain ==

In [[British English]] usage, a '''smallholding''' is a piece of land and its adjacent living quarters for the smallholder and [[stable|stabling]] for [[Livestock|farm animal]]s.  It is usually smaller than a [[farm]] but larger than an [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]], usually under {{convert|50|acre|ha}}. It is often established for breeding [[farm|farm animals]] [[organic movement|organically]] on [[free-range]] pastures. Alternatively, the smallholder may concentrate on [[market gardening|growing]] [[vegetable]]s by traditional methods or, in a more modern way, using plastic covers, [[Polytunnel]]ing or [[row cover|cloches]] for quick growth.

Generally, a smallholding offers its owner a means of achieving [[self-sufficiency]] for their family's needs.   They may be able to supplement their income by selling surplus produce at a [[farmers' market]] or at a permanent [[Retailing#Shops and Stores|shop]] on the smallholding.

In a separate development, so-called ''pick-your-own'' farms have appeared over the years near towns, which in type of management belong more to the category of smallholdings than to farms.  ''Pick your own Strawberries'' were pioneered in the UK by [[Ted Moult]] in 1961. This kind of business usually consists of a large field which has been subdivided into areas for [[fruit tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, or various [[vegetable]]s which [[ripen]] in different [[season]]s.  The smallholder maintains the gardens, and the consumers pay to [[harvest]] their own produce.

== Hobby farms in Australia ==
In western Australia, many small acre farms were established under the [[Agricultural Land Purchase Act]] to encourage settlement. The government purchased large land grants held by absentee owners and subdivided them according to the best use for the land: the development of orchids in [[Coondle, Western Australia|Coondle]], viticulture, horse breeding, sheep grazing, and high density crops like corn, and broad acre crops like wheat.

A [[Hobby farm]] in [[Australia]]n usage is a variety of smallholding that may be as small as 2 [[hectare]]s up to a self-sustaining farm size, that allows the "city farmer" to have a house and a small number of animals or small crop fields or [[grape vine]]s. In western Australia, these are often termed [[Special Rural Properties]] for planning purposes.

== Lifestyle blocks in New Zealand ==

In [[New Zealand]], a [[lifestyle block]] is a smallholding valued primarily for the rural lifestyle it affords. Planning restrictions on subdividing farm land often lead to the creation of lifestyle blocks of minimum  permissible size near urban areas.

== Developing countries ==
In many [[developing countries]], a smallholding is a small plot of land with low rental value, used to grow crops.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnett, R.B. (2002). ''Interactive Geography 4'', pp. 125, 315. SNP Pan Pacific Publishing. {{ISBN|981-208-657-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By some estimates, there are 525 million smallholder farmers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Nagayets,Oksana (2005). [http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/sfproc.pdf The Future of Small Farms]. International Food Policy Research Institute and Overseas Development Institute Vision 2020 Initiative, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smallholders dominate production in certain key sectors such as coffee and cocoa.  Various types of agribusinesses work with smallholding farmers in a range of roles including buying crops, providing seed, and acting as financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;International Finance Corporation (2013).

The '''symmetrical tonic neck reflex''' ('''STNR''') is a [[primitive reflex]] that normally emerges during the first year of an infant's life and is diminished by the age of 9-10 months.&lt;ref name="ndcbrain stnr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Dell|first1=Nancy|title=The Symmetric Tonic Neck Reflex (STNR)|url=http://www.ndcbrain.com/articles/SymmetricTonicNeckReflex.pdf|website=NDC Brain.com|publisher=Pediatric Neuropsychology Diagnostic and Treatment Center|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a bridging or transitional [[brainstem]] reflex that is an important developmental stage and is necessary for a baby to transition from lying on the floor to quadruped crawling or walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Teaching Motor Skills to Children with Cerebral Palsy and Similar Movement Disorders: A Guide for Parents and Professionals |author1=Sieglinde Martin |author2=M S |author3=P T | year=2006 |  isbn=1-890627-72-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to be able to do this the baby needs to have been successful in unlinking the automatic movement of the head from the automatic movement of the arms and legs to progress beyond this development stage.

The STNR is normally fully developed by 6–8 months and significantly diminished by 2–3 years. If this reflex is retained beyond 2–3 years to such a degree that it "modifies voluntary movement", the child is considered to have "immature and abnormal reflex development", and this can have broad effects on the child's later development.&lt;ref name="ndcbrain stnr" /&gt;

==Testing==
The '''symmetrical tonic neck reflex''' can be tested by placing the child in quadruped position on the floor and passively flexing the head forward and then extend it backwards. The expected response would be forward head flexion producing flexion of the upper extremities and extension of the lower extremities while extension of the head will produce extension of the upper extremities and flexion of the lower extremities.

==Significance==
This reflex can help the child to come to quadruped or crawling position but does not allow crawling because when the neck flexes forward, the upper limbs flex and lower limbs go into extension. This reflex is not normally easily seen or elicited in normal infants but may be seen in an exaggerated form in many children with cerebral palsy.

'''Venetjoki Reservoir''' ({{lang-fi|Venetjoen tekojärvi}}) is a medium-sized lake in the [[Perhonjoki]] main catchment area. It is located in the [[Central Ostrobothnia]] region in [[Finland]].&lt;ref name=jw&gt;[http://www.jarviwiki.fi/w/index.php?title=Venetjoen_tekoj%C3%A4rvi_%2849.072.2.001%29&amp;setlang=en Venetjoki Reservoir in the Jarviwiki Web Service]. Retrieved 2014-03-07. {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the reservoir is to prevent spring flooding in the lower parts of the river. On the river Perhonjoki there are also two smaller reservoirs, [[Patana Reservoir]] and [[Vissavesi Reservoir]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3949">The '''Western Regional Examining Board (WREB)''' is one of five examination agencies for [[Dentist|dentists]] and [[dental hygienists]] in the [[United States]]. The other examination agencies are, [[Council of Interstate Testing Agencies]], [[Central Regional Dental Testing Service]], [[Northeast Regional Board of Dental Examiners]], [[Southern Regional Testing Agency]]. These were organized to better standardize clinical exams for licensure.

WREB '''members for Dental and Dental Hygiene,''' unless otherwise noted are [[Alaska]], [[Arizona]], Arkansas, [[California]] (Dental), Hawaii (Dental Hygiene) [[Idaho]], [[Illinois]], Iowa, [[Kansas]], Minnesota, Mississippi (Dental Hygiene), [[Missouri]], [[Montana]], Nevada, [[New Mexico]], [[North Dakota]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Oregon]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], West Virginia (affiliate member) and [[Wyoming]]. These states help create the exam.

Other states that are currently accepting successful completion results of the WREB exam in support of initial licensure are Alabama, [[California]] (Dental Hygiene), [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Indiana]], Kentucky, [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], Michigan, [[Nebraska]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], Rhode Island, [[South Dakota]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], and [[Wisconsin]].
