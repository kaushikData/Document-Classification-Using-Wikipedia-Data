'''Abandoned footwear''', such as a lone [[boot]] or [[shoe]], has often been noted in out-of-the-way places like [[pond]]s or by the side of roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WE&amp;s_site=kansas&amp;p_multi=WE&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=10BF662BC5D8FA90&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|publisher=Wichita Eagle|date=August 7, 2005|pages=1E|title=Shoe-icide - and other mysteries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/news_opinion/featuresblogs/featuresblogsbarnett/3129176.Shoewatch_update/|title=Shoewatch update|date=13 August 2007|author=Dave Barnett|publisher= Bradford Telegraph &amp; Argus}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes the shoes may even be new and fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/22487390.html?dids=22487390:22487390&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Dec+14%2C+1995&amp;author=STEVE+HARVEY&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Only+in+L.A.&amp;pqatl=google|title=The Case of the Sidewalk with Two Red Shoes|publisher=Los Angeles Times|author=Steve Harvey|page=4|date=Dec 14, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many hypotheses about why this phenomenon seems to more often involve footwear than other types of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=RM&amp;p_theme=rm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB4DA4859F5BDB1&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Sole Survivor So That's Why Those Shoes Lie Alongside the Road|date=April 9, 1992|publisher=Rocky Mountain News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;s_site=mercurynews&amp;p_multi=SJ&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EF55F711E0B3DE3&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=That's Shoe-Biz|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|date=January 29, 1993|page=1E}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shoes, being more sturdily constructed than most other types of clothing, will last longer after being abandoned outdoors. Leather shoes, for instance, are estimated to last for 25–40 years outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.recycle.ubc.ca/littermain.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714094748/http://www.recycle.ubc.ca/littermain.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-07-14 |title=Litter Reduction Program }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some shoe abandonment is intentional, as in [[shoe tossing]], in which shoes are tied together by their laces and thrown in great numbers into trees, over power lines, or over fences.

==Artistic use==

Abandoned footwear is a feature in a number of artistic works, including: 

*Some artists derive insight and inspiration from abandoned footwear - a form of art known as ''[[objet trouvé]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/09/arts/seeing-new-york-with-a-poet-s-eye.html|title=Seeing New York With a Poet's Eye|author=Mervyn Rothstein|date=November 9, 1990|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*The lost slipper in the [[Cinderella]] folktale is a classic example of the literary device of the "lost object".&lt;ref name="Paul Gifford 2005 184"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzpbyNXLwLsC|page=184|title=Love, desire and transcendence in French literature|author=Paul Gifford|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7546-5269-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A fisherman hauling up an old boot, rather than a fish, is a comic-strip [[cliché]].&lt;ref name="Paul Gifford 2005 184"/&gt;  

*The theme of abandoned footwear and their untold story is explored in detail in Julie Ann Shapiro's novel, ''Jen-Zen and the One Shoe Diaries''.&lt;ref name=OSD&gt;{{citation|date=January 29, 2008|url=http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2008/01/27/books/9_13_441_26_08.txt|title=One shoe at a time|author=Gary Warth|publisher=North County Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The titular character describes the phenomenon, “The forgotten shoes are everywhere: [[litter]]ing the side of the highway, floating in the tide, going upstream with the salmon, or occupying a field like a dead body, discarded and left to rot.”  

*An abandoned boot is used as a magical transportation device (a "[[portkey]]") in the novel ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.

*The series 3 episode 5 episode "Diddle Diddle Dumpling", of British dark comedy series [[Inside No. 9]], is based around the premise of a man becoming fixated trying to trace the owner of an abandoned shoe.

==In sport==
Leaving behind shoes can be a symbol of retirement in sport. For example, as ESPN's Sherry Skalko describes about [[Rulon Gardner]]'s last wrestling bout in Athens, Greece:&lt;ref name="Skalko, Sherry"&gt;{{cite news|work=ESPN|title=Gardner leaves shoes, legacy behind|date=August 25, 2004|author=Skalko, Sherry|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/summer04/wrestling/columns/story?id=1867973}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;An emotional Rulon Gardner prepares to leave his shoes on the mat -- a symbol of retirement.

After the referee raised Gardner's hand in victory -- first to one side of the arena, then to the other -- Gardner grabbed an American flag, wiped away tears and parked himself in the middle of Mat B like "a 33-year-old kid" and took off his size 13 shoes. First the right one, the one that contains the constant reminder of the snowmobiling accident that almost took his life two years ago, then the left.

Then the super heavyweight bronze medalist stood up, bowed his head at each side of the mat and walked off, leaving his shoes behind, a wrestler's signal that he had fought his final bout.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Seattle Seahawks]] [[running back]] [[Marshawn Lynch]] announced his retirement on February 7, 2016 by [[tweeting]] a picture of a pair of football cleats abandoned on a telephone wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Marshawn|url=https://twitter.com/MoneyLynch/status/696525541826924546|title=Shawn Lynch on Twitter|website=Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
An unusual abundance of abandoned shoes was found on Miami's [[Palmetto Expressway]] on Friday, 2 January 2009.  Thousands of assorted shoes of all kinds and conditions were scattered across the highway, disrupting traffic for many hours.  The shoes were collected for the charity [[Soles4Souls]] which redistributes shoes to needy people.  This unusually large batch of shoes was expected to go to [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/02/AR2009010202326.html |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |title=Thousands of Shoes Appear on Miami Freeway |date=January 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/pitw/archives/2009/01/06/nashville-charity-corrals-thousands-of-abandoned-shoes-on-south-florida-highway |title=Nashville Charity Corrals Thousands of Abandoned Shoes on South Florida Highway |author=Brantley Hargrove |date=Jan 6, 2009 |journal=Nashville Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Triode_Circuit.svg|thumb|A generic triode circuit showing "A", "B" and "C" batteries]]

In the early days of [[electronics]], [[vacuum tube]] (called ''valves'' in British contexts) devices (such as radios) were powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]]. Each battery had a different designation depending on which '''vacuum tube''' element it was associated with.

Initially, the only such device was a [[Diode#Thermionic and gaseous state diodes|diode]] with only a [[electrical filament|filament]] [[Cathode#Vacuum tubes|(cathode)]] and a [[Plate electrode|plate]] [[Anode#Vacuum tube anode|(anode)]]. Following the direction of electron flow, these electrodes were identified as "A" and "B", respectively and thus the associated batteries were referred to as the [[#A battery|"A" battery]] and [[#B battery|"B" battery]], respectively. Later, when the [[control grid]] element was added to create the [[triode]] tube, it was logically assigned the letter "C" and supplied from a [[#C battery|"C" battery]]. Subsequent addition of further internal elements to improve the performance of the triode did not require an extension to this series of batteries &amp;ndash; these elements were either [[Voltage divider#Resistive divider|resistively-biased]] from the existing batteries, connected to ground or to the cathode.

This nomenclature was used primarily within North America. Different battery names were used elsewhere in the English speaking world.

==A battery==

An '''A battery''' is any battery used to provide power to the filament of a vacuum tube. It is sometimes colloquially referred to as a "[[Battery (electricity)#Wet cell|wet battery]]". (A dry cell could be used for the purpose, but the ampere-hour capacity of dry cells was too low at the time to be of practical use in this service). The term comes from the days of valve (tube) radios when it was common practice to use a dry battery for the plate (anode) voltage and a rechargeable lead/acid "wet" battery for the filament voltage. (The filaments in vacuum tubes consumed much more current than the anodes, and so the "A" battery would drain much more rapidly than the "B" battery; therefore, using a rechargeable "A" battery in this role reduced the need for battery replacement. In contrast, a non-rechargeable "B" battery would need to be replaced relatively infrequently.)

A batteries were initially 2 volts, being lead acid accumulators, but with the introduction of all dry battery radios, 1.4 volts became more common. Other voltages can be encountered. For example, 7.5 volt batteries were sometimes used to power a series connected set of 1.4 [[volt]] valves (tubes).

In Britain and some other countries, the "A" battery was known as the "LT" (low tension) battery if dry, and simply the "accumulator" if wet.

==B battery==
A '''B battery''' is any battery used to provide the [[plate voltage]] of a vacuum tube. It is sometimes colloquially referred to as a "dry battery" (although there's no reason why a "wet" battery of suitable voltage couldn't be utilised for the purpose).

The [[electrical filament|filament]] is primarily a heat source and therefore the A battery supplies significant [[Electric current|current]] and rapidly discharges. The B battery experiences comparatively little current draw and retains its stored capacity far longer than an A battery. Early B batteries used with bright emitter tubes were 120 volts, but these quickly became obsolete as they were replaced with examples having voltages of typically 45 volts, 67½ volts, or 90 volts as more efficient tubes became available. Some examples had taps every 22½ volts.

Even when the plate voltage rail is fed by a power supply rather than a battery, it is generally referred to as the "B+" line in American schematics.

Because plate voltages can be as high as 300[[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]], multiple B batteries may be connected together in series to additively provide the required operating voltages. The much higher available voltage of B batteries means that they must be handled more carefully than other battery types due to their ability to shock and/or burn the person handling them.

In Britain and in some other countries, the "B" battery was known as the "[[HT (vacuum tube)|HT]]" (high tension) battery.

==C battery==
{{dablink|Not to be confused with a [[C battery|C cell]]}}

In [[electronics]], a '''C battery''' may refer to any [[battery (electricity)|battery]] used to provide bias to the [[control grid]] of a [[vacuum tube]]. Until the early 1930s this was common practice in valve (tube) radio sets but was largely superseded by [[grid leak]] [[resistor]]s or [[voltage divider]] [[biasing]]. Because the tube grids drew no current, the C battery provided the bias voltage with no current draw. The battery's life in the radio was essentially its shelf life.

Grid bias batteries are still manufactured today, but not for radio use. They are popular in schools and colleges as a convenient variable voltage source in science classes. The most popular battery is the 9 volt type with taps every 1½ volts that accept [[banana plug]]s.

A rare form of "C" battery was the ''bias cell'', a button-size miniature battery designed to deliver a constant voltage with no current drain. These were briefly popular between 1936 and 1945 as the bias cell was less costly than a resistor/capacitor bias network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquewireless.org/uploads/1/6/1/2/16129770/09-the_mallory_bias_cell.pdf|title=The Mallory Bias Cell|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain and in some other countries, the "C" battery was known as the "GB" (grid bias) battery.

'''Bioenergetic systems''' are [[metabolic]] processes that relate to the flow of energy in living organisms. Those processes convert energy into [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), which is the form suitable for muscular activity. There are two main forms of synthesis of ATP: ''aerobic'', which involves oxygen from the bloodstream, and ''anaerobic'', which does not. [[Bioenergetics]] is the field of biology that studies bioenergetic systems.

==Overview==
The [[cellular respiration]] process that converts food energy into ATP (a form of energy) is largely dependent on [[oxygen]] availability. During [[exercise]], the supply and demand of oxygen available to [[muscle cells]] is affected by duration and intensity and by the individual's cardiorespiratory fitness level. Three exercise energy systems can be selectively recruited, depending on the amount of oxygen available, as part of the cellular respiration process to generate the ATP for the muscles. They are ATP, the anaerobic system and the aerobic system.

==Adenosine triphosphate==
ATP is the usable form of [[chemical energy]] for muscular activity. It is stored in most cells, particularly in muscle cells. Other forms of chemical energy, such as those available from food, must be transformed into ATP before they can be utilized by the muscle cells.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward L. Fox|title=Sports physiology|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=GWBsAAAAMAAJ}}|year=1979|publisher=Saunders College Publishing|isbn=978-0-7216-3829-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coupled reactions==
Since energy is released when ATP is broken down, energy is required to rebuild or resynthesize it. The building blocks of ATP synthesis are the by-products of its breakdown; [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) and [[inorganic phosphate]] (Pi). The energy for ATP resynthesis comes from three different series of chemical reactions that take place within the body. Two of the three depend upon the type of food eaten, whereas the other depends upon a chemical compound called [[phosphocreatine]]. The energy released from any of these three series of reactions is coupled with the energy needs of the reaction that resynthesizes ATP. The separate reactions are functionally linked together in such a way that the energy released by the one is always used by the other.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

Three methods can synthesize ATP:
*ATP–CP system (phosphogen system) – This system is used for durations of up to 10 seconds. The ATP–CP system neither uses [[oxygen]] nor produces [[lactic acid]] if oxygen is unavailable and is thus said to be alactic anaerobic. This is the primary system behind very short, powerful movements like a golf swing, a 100&amp;nbsp;m sprint or powerlifting.
*Anaerobic system – Predominates in supplying energy for exercises lasting less than two minutes. Also known as the [[glycolytic system]]. An example of an activity of the intensity and duration that this system works under would be a 400 m sprint.
*Aerobic system – This is the long-duration energy system. After five minutes of exercise, the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system is dominant. In a 1&amp;nbsp;km run, this system is already providing approximately half the energy; in a [[marathon]] run it provides 98% or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orgs.jmu.edu/strength/JMU_Summer_2000_WebPage/JMU_Summer_2000_Sections/14_Summer_Energy_Systems.htm|title=James Madison University Strength and Conditioning Program|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420102039/http://orgs.jmu.edu/strength/JMU_Summer_2000_WebPage/JMU_Summer_2000_Sections/14_Summer_Energy_Systems.htm|archivedate=2008-04-20|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aerobic and anaerobic systems usually work concurrently. When describing activity, it is not a question of which energy system is working, but which predominates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exrx.net/ExInfo/EnergyGraphs.html Energy Proportion Graphs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aerobic and anaerobic metabolism==
The term metabolism refers to the various series of chemical reactions that take place within the body. Aerobic refers to the presence of oxygen, whereas anaerobic means with series of chemical reactions that does not require the presence of oxygen. The ATP-CP series and the lactic acid series are anaerobic, whereas the oxygen series is aerobic.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;{{rp|9}}

==ATP–CP: the phosphagen system==
[[File:ATP-PC.jpg|thumb|(A) Phosphocreatine, which is stored in muscle cells, contains a high energy bond. (B) When creatine phosphate is broken down during muscular contraction, a large amount of energy is released. The energy released is coupled with the energy requirement to resynthesize ATP.]]

[[Creatine phosphate]] (CP), like ATP, is stored in muscle cells. When it is broken down, a large amount of energy is released. The energy released is coupled to the energy requirement necessary for the resynthesis of ATP.

The total muscular stores of both ATP and CP are small. Thus, the amount of energy obtainable through this system is limited. The phosphogen stored in the working muscles is typically exhausted in seconds of vigorous activity. However, ''the usefulness of the ATP-CP system lies in the rapid availability of energy rather than quantity''. This is important with respect to the kinds of physical activities that humans are capable of performing.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;{{rp|9–11}}

==Anaerobic system==
{{anchor|Anaerobic}}
&lt;!-- [[File:Lactic Acid System.jpg|thumb|When carbohydrate is broken down anaerobically to lactic acid. The energy released from this breakdown is coupled with the energy requirement to resynthesize ATP.]] --&gt;
This system is known as anaerobic [[glycolysis]]. "Glycolysis" refers to the breakdown of sugar. In this system, the breakdown of sugar supplies the necessary energy from which ATP is manufactured. When sugar is metabolized anaerobically, it is only partially broken down and one of the byproducts is [[lactic acid]]. This process creates enough energy to couple with the energy requirements to resynthesize ATP.

When H+ ions accumulate in the muscles causing the blood [[pH]] level to reach very low levels, temporary [[muscle fatigue]] results. Another limitation of the lactic acid system that relates to its anaerobic quality is that only a few moles of ATP can be resynthesized from the breakdown of sugar as compared to the yield possible when oxygen is present. This system cannot be relied on for extended periods of time.

The lactic acid system, like the ATP-CP system, is important primarily because it provides a rapid supply of ATP energy. For example, exercises that are performed at maximum rates for between 1 and 3 minutes depend heavily upon the lactic acid system for ATP energy. In activities such as running 1500 meters or a mile, the lactic acid system is used predominately for the "kick" at the end of a race.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;{{rp|11–12}}

* Glycolysis – The first stage is known as glycolysis, which produces 2 ATP molecules, 2 reduced molecules of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] ([[NADH]]) and 2 pyruvate molecules that move on to the next stage – the [[Krebs cycle]]. Glycolysis takes place in the [[cytoplasm]] of normal body cells, or the [[sarcoplasm]] of muscle cells.
* The Krebs cycle – This is the second stage, and the products of this stage of the aerobic system are a net production of one ATP, one [[carbon dioxide]] molecule, three reduced NAD molecules, one reduced [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] FAD molecule (The molecules of NAD and FAD mentioned here are electron carriers, and if they are said to be reduced, this means that they have had one H+ ion added to them). The [[metabolites]] are for each turn of the Krebs cycle. The Krebs cycle turns twice for each molecule of glucose that passes through the aerobic system – as two [[pyruvate]] molecules enter the Krebs cycle. In order for the pyruvate molecules to enter the Krebs cycle they must be converted to [[acetyl coenzyme A]]. During this link reaction, for each molecule of pyruvate that gets converted to acetyl coenzyme A, a NAD is also reduced. This stage of the aerobic system takes place in the matrix of the cells' [[mitochondria]].
* Oxidative phosphorylation – The last stage of the aerobic system produces the largest yield of ATP out of all the stages – a total of 34 ATP molecules. It is called oxidative [[phosphorylation]] because oxygen is the final acceptor of the [[electrons]] and [[hydrogen ions]] that leave this stage of aerobic respiration (hence oxidative) and ADP gets phosphorylated (an extra phosphate gets added) to form ATP (hence phosphorylation).

This stage of the aerobic system occurs on the [[crista]]e (infoldings on the membrane of the mitochondria). The NADH+ from glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, and the FADH+ from the Krebs cycle produce electron carriers at decreasing energy levels, in which energy is released to reform ATP. Each NADH+ that travels this electron transport chain provides enough energy for 3 molecules of ATP, and each molecule of FADH+ provides enough energy for 2 molecules of ATP. If you do your math this means that 10 total NADH+ molecules allow the rejuvenation of 30 ATP, and 2 FADH+ molecules allow for 4 ATP molecules to be rejuvenated (the total being 34 from oxidative phosphorylation, plus the 4 from the previous 2 stages meaning a total of 38 ATP being produced during the aerobic system). The NADH+ and FADH+ get oxidized to allow the NAD and FAD to return to be used in the aerobic system again, and electrons and hydrogen ions are accepted by oxygen to produce water, a harmless byproduct.

A '''calorie''' or '''calory''' (archaic) is a [[unit of energy]]. Various [[#Definitions|definitions]] exist but fall into two broad categories. The first, the '''small calorie''', or '''gram calorie''' (symbol: '''cal'''), is defined as the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one [[gram]] of water by one degree [[Celsius]] at a pressure of one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="Webster" /&gt; The second, the '''large calorie''' or '''kilogram calorie''' (symbols: '''Cal''', '''kcal'''), also known as the '''food calorie''' and similar names,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/remarkablecalorie.html|title=Remarkable Calorie|last=Conn |first=Carole |author2=Len Kravitz |publisher=University of New Mexico|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as the heat energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram (rather than a gram) of water by one degree Celsius. It is equal to {{val|1000|fmt=commas}} small calories.&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt;

Although these units relate to the [[metric system]], all of them have been considered obsolete in science since the adoption of the SI system.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt; The unit of energy in the [[International System of Units]] is the [[joule]]. One small calorie is approximately&lt;!--4.2 not 4.186 see below --&gt; 4.2 joules (so one large calorie is about 4.2 [[Joule#Kilojoule|kilojoules]]). The factor used to [[Conversion of units of energy|convert]] calories to joules at a given temperature is numerically equivalent to the [[specific heat capacity]] of water expressed in joules per kelvin per gram (or per kilogram, for kilocalories). The precise conversion factor depends on the definition adopted.

In spite of its non-official status, the large calorie is still widely used as a unit of [[food energy]]. The small calorie is also often used for measurements in [[chemistry]], although the amounts involved are typically recorded in kilocalories.

==History==
The (large) calorie was first defined by [[Nicolas Clément]] in 1824 as a unit of [[heat]] energy.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt; It entered French and English dictionaries between 1841 and 1867. The word comes {{ety|la|calor|heat}}. The small calorie was introduced by P. A. Favre and J. T. Silbermann in 1852. In 1879, [[Marcellin Berthelot]] introduced the convention of capitalizing the large Calorie to distinguish the senses. The use of the (large) calorie for nutrition was introduced to the American public by [[Wilbur Olin Atwater]], a professor at [[Wesleyan University]], in 1887.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt;

==Definitions==
The energy needed to increase the temperature of a given mass of water by 1&amp;nbsp;°C depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature. Accordingly, several different precise definitions of the calorie have been used.

The pressure is usually taken to be the [[standard atmospheric pressure]] ({{val|101.325|u=kPa}}). The temperature increase can be expressed as one [[kelvin]], which means the same as an increment of one degree Celsius.

{{reflist|group=note}}

The two definitions most common in older literature appear to be the ''15&amp;nbsp;°C calorie'' and the ''thermochemical calorie''. Until 1948, the latter was defined as 4.1833 international joules; the current standard of 4.184&amp;nbsp;J was chosen to have the new thermochemical calorie represent the same quantity of energy as before.&lt;ref name="Rossini"/&gt;

The calorie was first defined specifically to measure energy in the form of heat, especially in experimental [[calorimetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/02/calculating-calories-by-burning-gummy-bears-to-death/|title=Calculating Calories by Burning Gummy Bears to Death|publisher=Scientific American|first=Rhett|last=Allain|date=February 23, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition==
{{Main|Food energy}}
In a nutritional context, the [[kilojoule]] (kJ) is the [[SI]] unit of food energy, although the kilocalorie is still in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prospects improve for food energy labelling using SI units|url=http://metricviews.org.uk/2012/02/prospects-improve-for-food-energy-labelling-using-si-units/|work=Metric Views|publisher=[[UK Metric Association]]|accessdate=17 April 2013|date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''calorie'' is popularly used with the number of kilocalories of nutritional energy measured. As if to avoid confusion, it is sometimes written ''Calorie'' (with a capital "C") in an attempt to make the distinction, although this is not widely understood. Capitalization contravenes the rule that the initial letter of a [[unit name (SI)|unit name]] or [[derived unit|its derivative]] shall be lower case in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SI Conventions |url=http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/measurement-units/si-conventions/ |accessdate=8 February 2016 |publisher=[[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate comparison, [[specific energy]] or energy density figures are often quoted as "calories per serving" or "kilocalories per 100&amp;nbsp;g". A nutritional requirement or consumption is often expressed in calories per day. One gram of fat in food contains nine calories, while a gram of either a [[carbohydrate]] or a [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] contains approximately four calories.&lt;ref name=SciAm /&gt; Alcohol in a food contains seven calories per gram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutristrategy.com/nutrition/calories.htm|title=Calories - Fat, Protein, Carbohydrates, Alcohol. Calories per gram|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
In other scientific contexts, the term ''calorie'' almost always refers to the small calorie. Even though it is not an SI unit, it is still used in chemistry. For example, the energy released in a [[chemical reaction]] per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of reagent is occasionally expressed in [[kilocalorie per mole|kilocalories per mole]].&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt; Typically, this use was largely due to the ease with which it could be calculated in laboratory reactions, especially in [[aqueous solution]]: a volume of reagent dissolved in water forming a solution, with concentration expressed in moles per liter (1 liter weighing 1&amp;nbsp;kg), will induce a temperature change in degrees Celsius in the total volume of water solvent, and these quantities (volume, molar concentration and temperature change) can then be used to calculate energy per mole. It is also occasionally used to specify energy quantities that relate to reaction energy, such as [[bond energy|enthalpy of formation]] and the size of [[activation energy|activation barrier]]s.&lt;ref name="Bhagavan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhagavan|first1=N. V.|title=Medical Biochemistry|date=2002|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780120954407|pages=76-77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Dc9bOs9uAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=calorie+%22activation+barrier%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IRyGz36-f4&amp;sig=F6W2cLFrgfNB-62fdYtCrUCAHVI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUhvXi3o3WAhXKzlQKHdLxCJoQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=calorie%20%22activation%20barrier%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its use is being superseded by the SI unit, the joule, and multiples thereof such as the kilojoule.

== Measurement of energy content of food ==
In the past a [[Calorimeter|bomb calorimeter]] was utilised to determine the energy content of food by burning a sample and measuring a temperature change in the surrounding water. Today this method is not commonly used in the USA and has been succeeded by calculating the energy content indirectly from adding up the energy provided by energy-containing nutrients of food (such as protein, carbohydrates and fats). The fibre content is also subtracted to account for the fact fibre is not digested by the body.&lt;ref name=SciAm&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-food-manufacturers/|title=How Do Food Manufacturers Calculate the Calorie Count of Packaged Foods?|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''capacitor plague''' was a problem related to a higher-than-expected failure rate of non-solid [[aluminum electrolytic capacitor]]s, between 1999 and 2007, especially those from some Taiwanese manufacturers,&lt;ref name= Paumanok&gt;{{cite journal |author=D.

High [[failure rate]]s occurred in many well-known brands of electronics, and was particularly evident in [[motherboard]]s, [[video card]]s, and [[power supply unit (computer)|power supplies]] of [[personal computer]]s, leading to premature failure of these devices.

==History==

===First announcements===
Faulty capacitors have been a problem since capacitors' initial development, but the first flawed capacitors linked to Taiwanese raw material problems were reported by the specialist magazine ''Passive Component Industry'' in September 2002.&lt;ref name= Paumanok/&gt; Shortly thereafter, two mainstream electronics journals reported the discovery of widespread prematurely failing capacitors, from Taiwanese manufacturers, in motherboards.&lt;ref name= "EDN"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sperling |first1= Ed |last2= Soderstrom |first2= Thomas |last3= Holzman |first3= Carey |title= Got Juice? |journal= [[EE Times]] |date= October 2002 |url= http://www.edn.com/electronics-news/4347300/Got-Juice-}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Feb2003Spectrum"/&gt;

These publications informed engineers and other technically interested specialists, but the issue did not receive widespread public exposure until [[Carey Holzman]] published his experiences about "leaking capacitors" in the [[overclocking]] performance community.&lt;ref&gt;Carey Holzman, Overclockers, Capacitors: Not Just For Abit Owners, Motherboards with leaking capacitors, 10/9, 2002, [http://www.overclockers.com/capacitors-not-just-for-abit-owners/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public attention===
[[File:Brand auf Platine.jpg|thumb|right|Results of fire on a printed circuit board, caused by leaked electrolyte which [[short-circuit]]ed conductors carrying power]]

The news from the Holzman publication spread quickly on the Internet and in newspapers, partly due to the spectacular images of the failures — bulging or burst cans, expelled sealing rubber and leaking electrolyte on countless circuit boards. Many PC users were affected, and caused an avalanche of reports and comments on thousands of blogs and other web communities.&lt;ref name= "Feb2003Spectrum"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Chiu |first1= Yu-Tzu |first2= Samuel K |last2= Moore |title= Faults &amp; Failures: Leaking capacitors muck up motherboards |journal= [[IEEE Spectrum]] |volume= 40 |issue= 2 |date=February 2003 |pages= 16–17 |issn= 0018-9235 |doi= 10.1109/MSPEC.2003.1176509 |url= http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/leaking-capacitors-muck-up-motherboards |accessdate= 2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1026911/taiwanese-component-cause-mass-recalls|date=5 November 2002|accessdate=27 April 2015|first1=Paul|last1=Hales|title=Taiwanese component problems may cause mass recalls|publisher=[[The Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geek.com/science/capacitor-failures-plague-motherboard-vendors-551780/ Capacitor failures plague motherboard vendors, GEEK, 7 February 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

The quick spread of the news also resulted in many misinformed users and blogs posting pictures of capacitors that had failed due to reasons other than faulty electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;W. BONOMO, G. HOOPER, D. RICHARDSON, D. ROBERTS, and TH. VAN DE STEEG, Vishay Intertechnology, Failure modes in capacitors, [http://www.electronicproducts.com/Passive_Components/Capacitors/Failure_modes_in_capacitors.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevalence===
Most of the affected capacitors were produced from 1999 to 2003 and failed between 2002 and 2005. Problems with capacitors produced with an incorrectly formulated electrolyte have affected equipment manufactured up to at least 2007.&lt;ref name=PCTools/&gt;

Major vendors of motherboards such as [[Universal Abit|Abit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |newspaper= Heise |edition= online |title= Mainboardhersteller steht für Elko-Ausfall gerade |language= German |url= http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Mainboardhersteller-steht-fuer-Elko-Ausfall-gerade-Update-153175.html |place= [[Germany|DE]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[IBM]],&lt;ref name= Paumanok/&gt; [[Dell]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Singer, CNET News, Bulging capacitors haunt Dell, 31 October 2005 [http://news.cnet.com/Bulging-capacitors-haunt-Dell/2100-1003_3-5924742.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], and [[Intel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/PCs-plagued-by-bad-capacitors/2100-1041_3-5942647.html Michael Singer, CNET News, PCs plagued by bad capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt; were affected by capacitors with faulty electrolytes.

In 2005, Dell spent some US$420 million replacing motherboards outright and on the logistics of determining whether a system was in need of replacement.&lt;ref&gt;The guardian technology blog, How a stolen capacitor formula ended up costing Dell $300m [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/jun/29/dell-problems-capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2010&gt;{{cite news |last=Vance|first=Ashlee|title=Suit Over Faulty Computers Highlights Dell's Decline|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/technology/29dell.html|accessdate=2012-03-08|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other equipment manufacturers unknowingly assembled and sold boards with faulty capacitors, and as a result the effect of the capacitor plague could be seen in all kinds of devices worldwide.

Because not all manufactures had offered recalls or repairs, [[Do it yourself|do-it-yourself]] repair instructions were written and published on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://afrotechmods.com/tutorials/2011/11/28/capacitor-replacement-tutorial/ |publisher= Afro tech mods |title= Capacitor Replacement Video Tutorial |format= HD |type= video}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Repair and bad capacitor information |url= http://www.capacitorlab.com/ |publisher= Capacitor Lab}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsibility===
In the November/December 2002 issue of ''Passive Component Industry'', following its initial story about defective electrolyte, reported that some large Taiwanese manufacturers of electrolytic capacitors were denying responsibility for defective products.&lt;ref name=Liotta&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Bettyann |last1=Liotta |title=Taiwanese Cap Makers Deny Responsibility |journal=Passive Component Industry |date=November 2002 |volume=4 |number=6 |pages=6, 8–10 |url=http://old.passivecomponentmagazine.com/files/archives/2002/PCI_02_06Nov-Dec.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2015-11-03 |publisher=Paumanok Publications |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120065846/http://old.passivecomponentmagazine.com/files/archives/2002/PCI_02_06Nov-Dec.pdf |archivedate=20 November 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While industrial customers confirmed the failures, they were not able to trace the source of the faulty components. The defective capacitors were marked with previously unknown brands such as "Tayeh", "Choyo", or "Chhsi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opencircuits.com/Capacitor_plague |title=Capacitor plague, identifizierte Hersteller (~identified vendors) |publisher=Opencircuits.com |date=2012-01-10 |accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marks were not easily linked to familiar companies or product brands. Failed e-caps with well known brands may have had failures not related to defective electrolyte.

The motherboard manufacturer ABIT Computer Corp. was the only affected manufacturer that publicly admitted to defective capacitors obtained from Taiwan capacitor makers being used in its products.&lt;ref name=Liotta/&gt; However, the company would not reveal the name of the capacitor maker that supplied the faulty products.

==Symptoms==

===Common characteristics===
The non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors with improperly formulated electrolyte mostly belonged to the so-called "low [[equivalent series resistance|ESR]]", "low [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]", or "high ripple current" e-cap series. The advantage of e-caps using an electrolyte composed of 70% water or more is, in particular, a low ESR, which allows a higher [[Ripple (electrical)|ripple current]], and decreased production costs, water being the least costly material in a capacitor.&lt;ref name=Uzawa&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uzawa |first1=Shigeru |last2=Komatsu |first2=Akihiko |last3=Ogawara |first3=Tetsushi |last4=Rubycon Corporation |title=Ultra Low Impedance Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor with Water based Electrolyte |journal=Journal of Reliability Engineering Association of Japan |date=2002 |volume=24 |number=4 |pages=276–283 |id=Accession number 02A0509168 |issn=0919-2697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premature failure===
All electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte age over time, due to evaporation of the electrolyte. The [[capacitance]] usually decreases and the [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) usually increases. The normal lifespan of a non-solid electrolytic capacitor of consumer quality, typically rated at 2000&amp;nbsp;h/85&amp;nbsp;°C and [[operating temperature|operating]] at 40&amp;nbsp;°C, is roughly 6 years. It can be more than 10 years for a 1000&amp;nbsp;h/105&amp;nbsp;°C capacitor operating at 40&amp;nbsp;°C. Electrolytic capacitors that operate at a lower temperature can have a considerably longer lifespan.

The capacitance should normally degrade to as low as 70% of the rated value, and the ESR increase to twice the rated value, over the normal life span of the component, before it should be considered as a "degradation failure".&lt;ref name=Albertsen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jianghai-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/JIANGHAI_Elcap_Lifetime_-_Estimation_AAL.pdf |title=A. Albertsen, Electrolytic Capacitor Lifetime Estimation |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parler&gt;Sam G. Parler, Cornell Dubilier, Deriving Life Multipliers for Electrolytic Capacitors [http://www.newark.com/pdfs/techarticles/cornell/multipliers.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The life of an electrolytic capacitor with defective electrolyte can be as little as two years. The capacitor may fail prematurely after reaching approximately 30% to 50% of its expected lifetime.

===Electrical symptoms===
The electrical characteristics of a failed electrolytic capacitor with an open vent are the following:
*capacitance value decreases to below the rated value
*ESR increases to very high values.

Electrolytic capacitors with an open vent are in the process of drying out, regardless of whether they have good or bad electrolyte. They always show low capacitance values and very high ohmic ESR values. Dry e-caps are therefore electrically useless.

E-caps can fail without any visible symptoms. Since the electrical characteristics of electrolytic capacitors are the reason for their use, these parameters must be tested with instruments to definitively decide if the devices have failed. But even if the electrical parameters are out of their specifications, the assignment of failure to the electrolyte-problem is not a certainty.

Non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors without visible symptoms, which have improperly formulated electrolyte, typically show two electrical symptoms:
*relatively high and fluctuating [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage current]]&lt;ref&gt;The Aluminum Electrolytic Condenser, H. 0. Siegmund, Bell System Technical Journal, v8, 1. January 1229, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Güntherschulze, H. Betz, Elektrolytkondensatoren, Verlag Herbert Cram, Berlin, 2. Auflage 1952&lt;/ref&gt;
*increased capacitance value, up to twice the rated value, which fluctuates after heating and cooling of the capacitor body

===Visible symptoms===
[[File:Blown up electrolytic capacitor.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a broken electrolytic capacitor vent and dried electrolyte residue]]

When examining a failed electronic device, the failed capacitors can easily be recognized by clearly visible symptoms that include the following:&lt;ref name="SilChip2003"/&gt;

*Bulging of the vent on top of the capacitor. (The "vent" is stamped into the top of the casing of a can-shaped capacitor, forming a seam that is meant to split to relieve pressure build-up inside, preventing an explosion.)
*Broken or cracked vent, often accompanied with visible crusty rust-like brown or red dried electrolyte deposits.
*Capacitor casing sitting crooked on the circuit board, caused by the bottom rubber plug being pushed out, sometimes with electrolyte having leaked onto the motherboard from the base of the capacitor, visible as dark-brown or black surface deposits on the PCB.&lt;ref&gt;Blown, Burst and Leaking Motherboard Capacitors - A Serious Problem,  PCSTATS, Jan 15 2005 [http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleID=195]&lt;/ref&gt; The leaked electrolyte can be confused with thick elastic glue sometimes used to secure the capacitors against shock. A dark brown or black crust up the side of a capacitor is invariably glue, not electrolyte. The glue itself is harmless.

==Non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors==
{{see also|Aluminum electrolytic capacitor}}
The first [[electrolytic capacitor]] developed was an [[aluminum electrolytic capacitor]] with a liquid [[electrolyte]], invented by [[Charles Pollak]] in 1896.  Modern electrolytic capacitors are based on the same fundamental design. After roughly 120 years of development billions of these inexpensive and reliable capacitors are used in electronic devices.

===Basic construction===
{{gallery |title=Basic construction details of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors |align=center|lines=4

}}

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are generally called "electrolytic capacitors" or "e-caps". The components consist of two strips of aluminum foil, separated by a paper spacer, which is saturated with a liquid or gel-like electrolyte. One of the aluminum foil strips, called the anode, chemically roughened and oxidized in a process called ''forming'', holds a very thin oxide layer on its surface as an electrical insulator serving as the [[dielectric]] of the capacitor. The liquid electrolyte, which is the cathode of the capacitor, covers the irregular surface of the oxide layer of the anode perfectly, and makes the increased anode surface effectual, thus increasing the effective capacitance.

A second aluminum foil strip, called the "cathode foil", serves to make electrical contact with the electrolyte.  The spacer separates the foil strips to avoid direct metallic contact which would produce a short circuit. Lead wires are attached to both foils which are then rolled with the spacer into a wound cylinder which will fit inside an aluminum case or "can". The winding is impregnated with liquid electrolyte. This provides a reservoir of electrolyte to extend the lifetime of the capacitor. The assembly is inserted into an aluminum can and sealed with a plug. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte have grooves in the top of the case, forming a vent, which is designed to split open in the event of excessive gas pressure caused by heat, short circuit, or failing electrolyte.

===Forming the aluminum-oxide dielectric===

The aluminum foil used in non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors must have a purity of 99.99%. The foil is roughened by electrochemical etching to enlarge the effective capacitive surface.  This etched anode aluminum foil is oxidized (called ''forming''). Forming creates a very thin oxide barrier layer on the anode surface.  This oxide layer is electrically insulating and serves as the [[dielectric]] of the capacitor. The forming takes place whenever a positive voltage is applied to the anode, and generates an oxide layer whose thickness varies according to the applied voltage.  This electrochemical behavior explains the self-healing mechanism of non-solid electrolytic capacitors.

The normal process of oxide formation or self-healing is carried out in two reaction steps.&lt;ref&gt;Sundoc Bibliothek, Universität Halle, Dissertation, Aluminum anodization, [http://sundoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/diss-online/04/04H055/t2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; First, a strongly exothermic reaction transforms metallic aluminum (Al) into [[aluminum hydroxide]], Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:
:2 Al + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ↑

This reaction is accelerated by a high electric field and by high temperatures, and is accompanied by a pressure buildup in the capacitor housing, caused by the released hydrogen gas. The gel-like aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (also called alumina trihydrate (ATH), aluminic hydroxide, aluminum(III) hydroxide, or hydrated alumina) is converted, via a second reaction step (usually slowly over a few hours at room temperature, more rapidly in a few minutes at higher temperatures), into the amorphous or crystalline form of [[aluminum oxide]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:
:2 Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 AlO(OH) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

This oxide serves as dielectric and also protects the capacitor from the aggressive reactions of metallic aluminum to parts of the electrolyte. One problem of the forming or self-healing processes in non-solid aluminum electrolytics is that of corrosion, the electrolyte having to deliver enough oxygen to generate the oxide layer, with water, corrosive of aluminum, being the most efficient way.

===Electrolyte composition===
The name "electrolytic capacitor" derives from the electrolyte, the conductive liquid inside the capacitor. As a liquid it can conform to the etched and porous structure of the anode and the grown oxide layer, and form a "tailor-made" cathode.

From an electrical point of view the electrolyte in an electrolytic capacitor is the actual [[cathode]] of the capacitor and must have good electrical conductivity, which is actually [[ion]]-conductivity in liquids. But it is also a chemical mixture of [[solvent]]s with [[acid]] or [[alkali]] additives,&lt;ref&gt;Elna, Principles, 3. Electrolyte, Table 2: An Example of the Composition of the Electrolyte {{cite web |url=http://www.elna.co.jp/en/capacitor/alumi/principle.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053235/http://www.elna.co.jp/en/capacitor/alumi/principle.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which must be [[corrosion|non-corrosive]] (chemically [[Chemically inert|inert]]) so that the capacitor, whose inner components are made of aluminum, remains stable over its expected lifetime. In addition to the good conductivity of operating electrolytes, there are other requirements, including chemical stability, chemical compatibility with aluminum, and low cost. The electrolyte should also provide oxygen for the forming processes and self-healing. This diversity of requirements for the liquid electrolyte results in a broad variety of proprietary solutions, with thousands of patented electrolytes.

Up to the mid 1990s electrolytes could be roughly placed into two main groups:
*electrolytes based on [[ethylene glycol]] and [[boric acid]]. In these so-called glycol or [[borax]] electrolytes, an unwanted chemical crystal water reaction occurs: "acid + alcohol gives ester + water". These borax electrolytes have been standard in electrolytic capacitors for a long time, and have a water content between 5 and 20%. They work up to a maximum temperature of 85&amp;nbsp;°C or 105&amp;nbsp;°C in the voltage range up to 600&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref&gt;NON-AQUEOUS ELECTROLYTES and THEIR CHARACTERISTICS, FaradNet Electrolytic Capacitors, Part III: Chapter 10 [http://www.faradnet.com/deeley/chapt_10.htm#index#index]&lt;/ref&gt;
*almost anhydrous electrolytes based on organic solvents, such as [[dimethylformamide]] (DMF), [[dimethylacetamide]] (DMA), or [[γ-butyrolactone]] (GBL). These capacitors with organic-solvent electrolytes are suitable for temperatures ranging up to 105&amp;nbsp;°C, 125&amp;nbsp;°C, or 150&amp;nbsp;°C; have low leakage current values; and have very good long-term behavior.

It was known that water is a very good solvent for low ohmic electrolytes. However, the corrosion problems linked to water hindered, up to that time, the use of it in amounts larger  than 20% of the electrolyte, the water-driven corrosion using the above-mentioned electrolytes being kept under control with chemical inhibitors that stabilize the oxide layer.&lt;ref&gt;K.

==Water-based electrolyte capacitors==
In the 1990s a third class of electrolytes was developed by Japanese researchers.
*Water-based electrolytes, with up to 70% water, are relatively inexpensive and boast desirable characteristics such as low ESR and higher voltage handling. These electrolytic capacitors are typically labeled "low-impedance", "low-ESR", or "high-ripple-current" with voltage ratings up to 100&amp;nbsp;V,&lt;ref name=Uzawa/&gt; for low-cost mass-market applications.
*Despite these advantages, researchers faced several challenges during development of water-based electrolytic capacitors.
*Many of the poorly designed capacitors made it to mass market. The capacitor plague is due to faulty electrolytes of this type.

===Development of a water-based electrolyte===
At the beginning of the 1990s, some Japanese manufacturers started the development of a new, low-ohmic water-based class of electrolytes. Water, with its high [[permittivity]] of ε = 81, is a powerful solvent for electrolytes, and possesses high solubility for conductivity-enhancing concentrations of [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] [[ions]], resulting in significantly improved conductivity compared to electrolytes with organic [[solvent]]s like [[gamma-Butyrolactone|GBL]]. But water will react quite aggressively and even violently with unprotected aluminum, converting metallic aluminum (Al) into [[aluminum hydroxide]] (Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), via a highly [[exothermic]] reaction that gives off heat, causing gas expansion that can lead to an explosion of the capacitor. Therefore, the main problem in the development of water-based electrolytes is achieving long-term stability by hindering the corrosive action of water on aluminum.

Normally the anode foil is covered by the dielectric [[aluminum oxide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) layer, which protects the base aluminum metal against the aggressiveness of aqueous alkali solutions. However, some impurities or weak points in the oxide layer offer the possibility for water-driven anodic corrosion that forms aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). In e-caps using an alkaline electrolyte this aluminum hydroxide will not be transformed into the desired stable form of aluminum oxide. The weak point remains and the anodic corrosion is ongoing. This corrosive process can be interrupted by protective substances in the electrolyte known as inhibitors or passivators.&lt;ref name=Alfonso/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Stevens, T. R. Marshall, A.C. Geiculescu m, C.R. Feger, T.F.

However, if inhibitors are used in an insufficient amount, they tend to increase pitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Reaction between Anodic Aluminum Oxide and Water |first1=Walter J |last1=Bernard |first2=John J |last2=Randall Jr |date=1961-04-07 |accessdate=2015-11-03 |doi=10.1149/1.2428230 |journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society |number=7 |volume=154 |pages=355–361 |url=http://www.alueurope.eu/talat/lectures/5103.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223095439/http://www.alueurope.eu/talat/lectures/5103.pdf |archivedate=23 December 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The water problem in non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors===

The aluminum oxide layer in the electrolytic capacitor is resistant to chemical attacks, as long as the pH value of the electrolyte is in the range of pH 4.5 to 8.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aluinfo.de/index.php/alu-encyclopaedia.html?let=o&amp;lid=79 |title=Alu Encyclopaedia, oxide layer |publisher=Aluinfo.de |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pH value of the electrolyte is ideally about 7 (neutral); and measurements carried out as early as the 1970s have shown that leakage current is increased, due to chemically induced defects, when the pH value deviates from this ideal value.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Sanz, J. M. Albella, J. M. Martinez-Duart, On the inhibition of the reaction between anodic aluminum oxide and water [http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/hindawi-publishing-corporation/on-the-inhibition-of-the-reaction-between-anodic-aluminum-oxide-and-Wn4Q79WyDa]&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that water is extremely corrosive to pure aluminum and introduces chemical defects. It is further known that unprotected aluminum oxide dielectrics can be slightly dissolved by alkaline electrolytes, weakening the oxide layer.&lt;ref name="HHpaper"/&gt;

The fundamental issue of water-containing-electrolyte systems lies in the control of aggressiveness of the water towards metallic aluminum. This issue has dominated the development of electrolytic capacitors over many decades.&lt;ref&gt;K. H. Thiesbürger: ''Der Elektrolyt-Kondensator'' 4th edition, Page 88 to 91, Roederstein, Landshut 1991 (OCLC 313492506)&lt;/ref&gt;  The first commercially used electrolytes in the mid-twentieth century were mixtures of [[ethylene glycol]] and [[boric acid]]. But even these glycol electrolytes had an unwanted chemical water-crystal reaction, according to the scheme: "acid + [[alcohol]]" → "[[ester]] + water". Thus, even in the first apparently water-free electrolytes, [[esterification]] reactions could generate a water content of up to 20 percent. These electrolytes had a voltage-dependent life span, because at higher voltages the leakage current based on the aggressiveness of the water would increase exponentially; and the associated increased consumption of electrolyte would lead to a faster drying out.&lt;ref name=Albertsen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parler/&gt; Otherwise, the electrolyte has to deliver the oxygen for self-healing processes, and water is the best chemical substance to do that.&lt;ref name=Uzawa/&gt;

===Water-driven corrosion: aluminum hydroxide===
&lt;span&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Attempt at a pictorial representation of the formation of aluminum hydroxide&lt;br/&gt;in a pore of a roughened electrolytic capacitor anode foil'''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

[[File:Elko-Anodenpore-Hydroxidbildung-english.jpg|400px|center|Attempt at a pictorial representation of the formation of aluminum hydroxide in a pore of a roughened electrolytic capacitor anode foil.]]

It is known that the "normal" course of building a stable aluminum oxide layer by the transformation of aluminum, through the intermediate step of aluminum hydroxide, can be interrupted by an excessively alkaline or basic electrolyte. For example, alkaline disruption of the chemistry of this reaction results instead in the following reaction:
:2 Al (s) + 2 NaOH (aq) + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + 2[Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; (s) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

In this case, it may happen that the hydroxide formed in the first step becomes mechanically detached from the metallic aluminum surface and will not be transformed into the desired stable form of aluminum oxide.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kaesche, Die Korrosion der Metalle - Physikalisch-chemische Prinzipien und aktuelle Probleme, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1966, {{ISBN|978-3-540-51569-2}} (1990 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2015}} The initial self-healing process for building a new oxide layer is prevented by a defect or a weak dielectric point, and generated hydrogen gas escapes into the capacitor. Then, at the weak point, further formation of aluminum hydroxide is started, and prevented from converting into stable aluminum oxide. The self-healing of the oxide layer inside the electrolytic capacitor can't take place. However, reactions do not come to a standstill, as more and more hydroxide grows in the pores of the anode foil, and the first reaction step produces more and more hydrogen gas in the can, increasing the pressure.

The Japanese manufacturer [[Rubycon Corporation|Rubycon]] became a leader in the development of new water-based electrolyte systems with enhanced conductivity in the late 1990s.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} After several years of development, researchers led by Shigeru Uzawa had found a mixture of inhibitors that suppressed the aluminum hydration. In 1998, Rubycon announced two series, ZL and ZA, of the first production capacitors using an electrolyte with a water content of about 40%, which were suitable for temperatures ranging from {{convert|-40|C|F K}} to {{convert|105|C|F K}}. Later, electrolytes were developed to work with water of up to 70% by weight.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Other manufacturers, such as NCC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemi-con.co.jp/e/catalog/aluminum.html |title=Ncc, Ecc |publisher=Chemi-con.co.jp |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nichicon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichicon-us.com/english/products/menu.htm |title=Nichicon |publisher=Nichicon-us.com |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elna&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elna.co.jp/en/capacitor/alumi/index.html |title=Elna |publisher=Elna |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed with their own products a short time later.

The improved conductivity of the new electrolyte can be seen by comparing two capacitors, both of which have a nominal capacitance of 1000&amp;nbsp;µF at 16&amp;nbsp;V rated voltage, in a package with a diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;mm and a height of 20&amp;nbsp;mm. The capacitors of the Rubycon YXG series are provided with an electrolyte based on an organic solvent and can attain an impedance of 46&amp;nbsp;mΩ when loaded with a ripple current of 1400&amp;nbsp;mA. ZL series capacitors with the new water-based electrolyte can attain an impedance of 23&amp;nbsp;mΩ with a ripple current of 1820&amp;nbsp;mA, an overall improvement of 30%.

The new type of capacitor was called "Low-ESR" or "Low-Impedance", "Ultra-Low-Impedance" or "High-Ripple Current" series in the data sheets. The highly competitive market in digital data technology and high-efficiency power supplies rapidly adopted these new components because of their improved performance. Furthermore, by improving the conductivity of the electrolyte, capacitors not only can withstand a higher ripple current rating, they are much cheaper to produce since water is much cheaper than other solvents. Better performance and low cost drove widespread adoption of the new capacitors for high volume products such as PCs, LCD screens, and power supplies.

==Investigation==
===Implications of industrial espionage===
{{More citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}
Industrial espionage was implicated in the capacitor plague, in connection with the theft of an electrolyte formula. A materials scientist working for [[Rubycon Corporation|Rubycon]] in [[Japan]] left the company, taking the secret water-based electrolyte formula for Rubycon's ZA and ZL series capacitors{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}, and began working for a Chinese company. The scientist then developed a copy of this electrolyte{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. Then, some staff members who defected from the Chinese company copied an incomplete version of the formula{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and began to market it to many of the [[aluminium]] electrolytic manufacturers in Taiwan, undercutting the prices of the Japanese manufacturers.&lt;ref name="Paumanok" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Low-ESR Aluminium Electrolytic Failures Linked to Taiwanese Raw Material Problems |url=http://www.molalla.net/members/leeper/alumin~1.pdf |publisher=Molalla |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426000850/http://www.molalla.net/members/leeper/alumin~1.pdf |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This incomplete electrolyte lacked important proprietary ingredients which were essential to the long-term stability of the capacitors&lt;ref name="Feb2003Spectrum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SilChip2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconchip.com.au/cms/A_30328/article.html |work=Silicon Chip|title= Motherboard Capacitor Problem Blows Up |place= [[Australia|AU]] |date=2003-05-11 |accessdate= 2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was unstable when packaged in a finished aluminum capacitor. This faulty electrolyte allowed the unimpeded formation of hydroxide and produced hydrogen gas.&lt;ref name="HHpaper"&gt;{{Citation |last1= Hillman |first1=Craig |last2= Helmold |first2=Norman |year= 2004 |title= Identification of Missing or Insufficient Electrolyte Constituents in Failed Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors |url=http://www.dfrsolutions.com/pdfs/2004_Electrolyte_Hillman-Helmold.pdf |publisher= DFR solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no known public court proceedings related to alleged theft of electrolyte formulas. However, one independent laboratory analysis of defective capacitors has shown that many of the premature failures appear to be associated with high water content and missing inhibitors in the electrolyte, as described below.

===Incomplete electrolyte formula===
Unimpeded formation of hydroxide (hydration) and associated hydrogen gas production, occurring during "capacitor plague" or "bad capacitors" incidents involving the failure of large numbers of aluminum electrolytic capacitors, has been demonstrated by two researchers at the [[Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering]] of the [[University of Maryland]] who analyzed the failed capacitors.&lt;ref name="HHpaper"/&gt;

The two scientists initially determined, by [[ion chromatography]] and [[mass spectrometry]], that there was hydrogen gas present in failed capacitors, leading to bulging of the capacitor's case or bursting of the vent. Thus it was proved that the oxidation takes place in accordance with the first step of aluminum oxide formation.

Because it has been customary in electrolytic capacitors to bind the excess hydrogen by  using reducing or [[depolarizer|depolarizing]] compounds, such as [[aromatic]] nitrogen compounds or [[amines]], to relieve the resulting pressure, the researchers then searched for compounds of this type. Although the analysis methods were very sensitive in detecting such pressure-relieving compounds, no traces of such agents were found within the failed capacitors.

In capacitors in which the internal pressure build-up was so great that the capacitor case was already bulging but the vent had not opened yet, the [[pH]] value of the electrolyte could be measured. The electrolyte of the faulty Taiwanese capacitors was alkaline, with a pH of between 7 and 8. Good comparable Japanese capacitors had an electrolyte that was acidic, with a pH of around 4. As it is known that aluminum can be dissolved by alkaline liquids, but not that which is mildly acidic, an [[energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDX or EDS) fingerprint analysis of the electrolyte of the faulty capacitors was made, which detected dissolved aluminum in the electrolyte.

To protect the metallic aluminum against the aggressiveness of the water, some phosphate compounds, known as inhibitors or [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivators]], can be used to produce long-term stable capacitors with high-aqueous electrolytes. Phosphate compounds are mentioned in patents regarding electrolytic capacitors with aqueous electrolytic systems.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Jeng-Kuei, Liao, Chi-Min, Chen, Chih-Hsiung, Tsai, Wen-Ta, Effect of electrolyte composition on hydration resistance of anodized aluminum oxide [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775304006743]&lt;/ref&gt; Since phosphate ions were missing and the electrolyte was also alkaline in the investigated Taiwanese electrolytes, the capacitor evidently lacked any protection against water damage, and the formation of more-stable alumina oxides was inhibited. Therefore, only aluminum hydroxide was generated.

The results of chemical analysis were confirmed by measuring electrical capacitance and leakage current in a long-term test lasting 56&amp;nbsp;days. Due to the chemical corrosion, the oxide layer of these capacitors had been weakened, so after a short time the capacitance and the leakage current increased briefly, before dropping abruptly when gas pressure opened the vent. The report of Hillman and Helmold proved that the cause of the failed capacitors was a faulty electrolyte mixture used by the Taiwanese manufacturers, which lacked the necessary chemical ingredients to ensure the correct pH of the electrolyte over time, for long-term stability of the electrolytic capacitors. Their further conclusion, that the electrolyte with its alkaline pH value had the fatal flaw of a continual buildup of hydroxide without its being converted into the stable oxide, was verified on the surface of the anode foil both photographically and with an EDX-fingerprint analysis of the chemical components.

The '''second-generation [[Chrysler minivans]]''' are a series of [[Minivan|minivans]] that were manufactured and marketed by [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]] in North America and Europe from 1991 to 1995.  Officially designated the AS platform by Chrysler, the second-generation minivans were again sold in passenger and cargo configurations by the Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge divisions.  

Launched in late 1990 for the 1991 model year, the second-generation minivans were an extensive revision of the first-generation chassis and body.  The model range became the first minivans offered with driver-side airbags (1991) and with optional integrated child safety seats (1992).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/1991-voyager.html|title=1991-1995 Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager minivans|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While adding all-wheel drive as an option for the first time, the AS platform would also mark the last offering of a manual transmission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;    

As with its predecessor, Chrysler assembled second-generation minivans at [[Windsor Assembly]] in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, with additional production at [[Saint Louis Assembly|Saint Louis (North) Assembly]] in Fenton, Missouri from 1990 to 1994.  In 1992, to supplement exports from the United States, the Chrysler Voyager began production in Graz, Austria (in the [[Eurostar Automobilwerk|Eurostar]] joint venture factory between Chrysler and [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]]).

For the 1996 model year, the AS-generation minivans were replaced by the [[Chrysler minivans (NS)|NS platform]], marking the first complete redesign of the Chrysler minivans since their introduction.  

==Overview==
Introduced in November 1990, the second-generation Chrysler minivans were marketed by the Dodge, Plymouth, and Chrysler divisions.  The Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager nameplates returned, with both short-wheelbase and long-wheelbase (Grand) body configurations.  As with the first-generation minivans, base-trim examples were equipped with 5-passenger seating, with 7-passenger seating as standard in higher-trim versions (SE, LE, ES/LX, and all Town &amp; Country vans).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For 1994, the model range underwent a mid-cycle revision, primarily intended to comply with 1998 upgrades to US federal safety standards for cars (although the entire model range was officially considered a light truck).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/1994.html|title=1994 minivans: Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, Chrysler Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside minor exterior styling changes, the minivans were given given dual airbags, four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, and side impact beams in the front and sliding doors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In another set of revisions, Chrysler sought to make the vans quieter, improving fit and finish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Chrysler minivans are officially designated the Chrysler AS platform (matching the Chrysler shift to two-letter platform designations in 1990).  Largely a substantial revision of the first-generation S-platform minivans, the AS chassis retained the 112.0 inch wheelbase for standard-wheelbase vans and 119.1 inches for extended-wheelbase "Grand" vans.  While structurally unrelated to the (discontinued) [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler K-cars]], the second-generation minivans shifted mechanical commonality towards its larger derivatives, adopting engines and transmissions from the Chrysler AA platform (Dodge Spirit/Plymouth Acclaim) and the Chrysler AC/AY platform (Chrysler New Yorker/Fifth Avenue/Imperial and Dodge Dynasty).  

Retaining the unibody construction of the first-generation minivans, the second-generation minivans are fitted with a MacPherson strut front suspension with coil rear springs; all-wheel drive versions have 4-wheel independent suspension with a leaf-sprung rear axle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  During the development of the platform, attention was paid on refining the handling over the first-generation vans, in order to improve stability, maneuverability, and steering feel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For 1991 to 1993, a disc front/rear drum brake configuration was utilized, with a four-wheel disc brake system introduced in 1994.  All versions were fitted with anti-lock brakes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

====Powertrain====
With the lone exception of the Chrysler 2.5L Turbo I inline-4, the second-generation minivans returned the powertrain from their 1990 predecessors.  The standard engine was a naturally-aspirated Chrysler 2.5L inline-4, producing 100 hp; this engine was standard on standard-wheelbase passenger vans and all cargo vans.  A Mitsubishi-produced 3.0L V6 (producing 142 hp) was an option on short-wheelbase vans.  Introduced in 1990, the Chrysler 3.3L V6 (producing 150 hp; increased to 162 hp in 1994) was standard on all Grand Voyagers/Grand Caravans, Town &amp; Countrys, and vans with all-wheel drive; the 3.3L V6 was offered on short-wheelbase as a second option.

For 1994, the AS-platform minivans adopted the 3.8L V6 engine from the Chrysler Imperial.  A larger-bore version of the 3.3L V6 tuned for additional torque output, while producing the same 162 hp of the 3.3L V6, produced 213 lb-ft of torque.  The standard engine of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and all-wheel drive vans, the 3.8L engine became an option on the Grand Voyager/Grand Caravan.      

Initially deleted from the model line for 1991, the 5-speed manual transmission made a return for 1992 through 1994 on base-trim or cargo vans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The 2.5L engine was available with a 3-speed TorqueFlite automatic, along with the 3.0L V6.  The 4-speed Ultradrive overdrive automatic transmission was fitted to both the 3.3L and 3.8L V6 engines.

=== Body ===
In an extensive redesign, the second-generation minivans featured a major revision of the exterior, lowering the exterior coefficient of drag from 0.43 to 0.39.  While the styling changes were largely evolutionary, the only shared body panels from the first-generation vans were the front doors and the sliding door.    

The front fascia saw the largest degree of change, with redesigned front fenders allowing for a lower hoodline.  Introduced in 1987, composite headlamp units made their return, wrapping into the front fenders.  With the lower hoodline, a smaller grille was used.  As part of the model change, stylists sought to differentiate the three model ranges from each other.  The Plymouth Voyager was given chrome-trimmed headlights and a sleeker version of its 1987-1990 grille; the Dodge Caravan was given headlamps without chrome trim and adopted the Dodge divisional four-segment grille for the first time.  The Chrysler Town &amp; Country shared its headlamps with the Plymouth Voyager with a model-specific waterfall-style grille.  In an effort to lessen rust and improve fit and finish, front and rear bumpers were redesigned, with wraparound plastic bumpers replacing steel and rubber-ended bumpers.

For 1991, the exterior door handles were carried over from the 1984-1990 vans; for the 1992 model year, the door handles were replaced by a larger design, fitted flush with the body.  

In line with the front fascia, the rear fascia underwent several major changes, with the rear liftgate redesigned.  In addition to rounded edges to improve aerodynamics, the liftgate added a larger rear window and a center/third rear brake lamp;  the rear window wiper was updated to feature intermittent modes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In addition to the extensive exterior changes, the interior saw a complete redesign; as with the previous generation, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager shared nearly identical interiors (across comparable trim levels).  Coinciding with the addition of a driver-side airbag, the dashboard was reconfigured, placing many primary and secondary controls within closer reach of the driver.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Dodge and Plymouth vans were offered with two different analog instrument panels, with the Chrysler Town &amp; Country fitted with a digital instrument panel.  For the first time, a glovebox was added to the dashboard (the underseat storage drawer made its return).  

The 1991 redesign adopted the seating configurations offered on the 1989-1990 vans.  While 5-passenger seating remained available on base-trim vans, 7-passenger seating became standard for all SE and LE-trim vans (regardless of wheelbase).  To meet federal safety standards, all outboard seating positions were fitted with 3-point seatbelts.  The Chrysler Town &amp; Country (in line with other high-content minivans) shifted from a second-row bench seat to second-row bucket seats as part of the redesign.  Marketed as "Quad Command" seats, the configuration was available on higher-trim (LE and LX/ES) Dodge and Plymouth vans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For 1992, for vans with second-row bench seats, Chrysler introduced integrated child safety seats as an optional feature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For 1994, the integrated child safety seats were modified, allowing for a recline position (closer to a standard carseat).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;    

=== Marketing variations ===
From the first-generation minivans, Chrysler carried over the previous trim levels essentially unchanged (the Mini Ram Van was replaced by the Dodge Caravan C/V).  Although once a distinguishing feature of the Chrysler minivans in the 1980s, simulated woodgrain trim began to fall out of favor in the 1990s.  In 1992, woodgrain became a delete option from the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and removed entirely from the Dodge Caravan for 1994.  

As part of the 1994 model revision, the liftgate badging was changed from a stamped silver-on-black badge to a smaller embossed silver font; this was the first change to badging since 1984.  Chrysler Town &amp; Country versions retained their script-style badging.

==== Chrysler Town &amp; Country ====
As part of the introduction of the second-generation minivans, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country became a permanent member of the minivan model range, intended as its flagship.  Produced only in the long-wheelbase body configuration, the Town &amp; Country was equipped with woodgrain trim, body-color mirrors, and alloy wheels; the Town &amp; Country is the only version of this generation produced with a [[Electronic instrument cluster|digital instrument panel]].  As with its Chrysler New Yorker and Imperial counterparts, the Town and Country was fitted with a crystal Pentastar hood ornament.  Along with tufted leather interior trim, the Town &amp; Country was fitted with "Quad Command" seating, replacing the second row bench seat with bucket seats matching those of the front row.

Although woodgrain trim had been associated with the Town &amp; Country nameplate since the 1940s, in 1992, the feature became a delete option (replaced by a gold pinstripe and a Town &amp; Country fender script) as it began to fall out of favor with buyers.  In 1993 for [[Model year|MY]]1994, Chrysler introduced a version of the Town &amp; Country with a body-color grille alongside the woodgrain side trim.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Chrysler Voyager (export) ====
Outside North America, as Chrysler does not own the rights to the Dodge or Plymouth brands, exports of the Chrysler minivans were done under the Chrysler nameplate.  In Europe, Chrysler began sales of the Voyager in 1988.  As with its first generation counterpart, the second-generation Chrysler Voyager is largely related to the Dodge Caravan in trim.  Initially produced by St. Louis Assembly, in 1992, Chrysler began sourcing the Voyager from Eurostar in Austria.  In 1994, the Chrysler Voyager began production with a 2.5L VM Motori diesel engine; as of 2017, these are the only diesel-powered Chrysler minivans.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager ====
As with the first generation minivans, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were trimmed nearly identically, with the exception of cargo vans marketed exclusively by the Dodge division (as the Dodge Caravan C/V and Grand Caravan C/V.  With the exception of the steering wheel, second-generation Dodge and Plymouth minivans are nearly identical internally across comparable trim levels; Dodge Caravans are fitted with a four-spoke steering wheel while Plymouth and Chrysler minivans use a two-spoke steering wheel.

Along with the base-trim 5-passenger vans, both divisions continued the mid-grade SE and deluxe-trim LE, with the LX serving as the top trim for the short-wheelbase Voyager and the ES serving as the top.

In a change from the first-generation vans, all SE and LE vans were offered with 7-passenger seating, regardless of wheelbase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  LE-trim vans included many features available on SE-trim vans as option as standard, along with additional sound insulation; long-wheelbase ("Grand") vans and all-wheel drive models were equipped with 15-inch wheels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The top trim in the Caravan and the Voyager was the ES (for both versions of the Caravan) and the LX (for the short-wheelbase Voyager).  Sharing its model features with LE-trim models included as standard equipment,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA2"&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1991 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt; the LX/ES trims served as a cosmetic upgrade similar to namesake trims in the [[Plymouth Acclaim]] and [[Dodge Spirit]].  In place of woodgrain trim, the LX was given color-keyed two-tone exterior; the ES was given nearly monochrome trim (as with the Dodge Spirit, ES-trim Caravans were fitted with white-painted wheels).  In line with the European Chrysler Voyager, the Dodge Caravan ES was not fitted with a stand-up hood ornament (with a body-color Chrysler Pentastar affixed directly onto the hood).

== Alternative-fuel vehicles ==

=== CNG minivan (1994) ===
Following the production of CNG-fuel ([[compressed natural gas]]) van prototypes derived from the [[Dodge Ram Van]] in 1992, Chrysler began production of a CNG-fuel version of its minivan in 1994.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/CNG-van.html|title=Chrysler CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) Minivans|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the 3.3L V6 and 4-speed Ultradrive transmission powertrain, the CNG minivans underwent several modifications to accommodate the change in fuel.  Along with modifications to the engine valvetrain, four 3000PSI CNG fuel tanks were added to the vehicle, taking the place of the spare tire well and gasoline tank, holding the energy equivalent of 8.5 gallons of gasoline.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Electric vehicles (1992-1995) ===
{{Main|Chrysler TEVan}}
The Chrysler TEVan is a [[battery electric vehicle]] developed between Chrysler and the Electric Power Research Institute.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/corporate/electric-cars.html|title=Chrysler and Electric Cars and Minivans: TEVan, EPIC, and more|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First unveiled as a concept in 1992, an unknown number were produced between 1993 and 1995 (between 56 and 80).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Deriving its name from the original T-115 codename for the Chrysler minivans and EV, the TEVan was sold nearly exclusively to fleet buyers; the vehicle was based on a standard-wheelbase five-passenger Dodge Caravan.

The TEVan used a 27&amp;nbsp;hp, 65&amp;nbsp;hp max (48&amp;nbsp;kW) Separately-Excited [[GE]] DC traction motor coupled to a two-speed FWD trans-axle that featured Hi, Lo, Reverse and Park. The owner's manual referred to it as a 'semi-automatic transmission' although it used a clutch. The motor controller was also manufactured by GE.

Two different battery types were available for the TEVan during its production;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; weighing in at {{convert|1800|lb}}, the battery pack brought the curb weight the minivan to {{convert|5060|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.  The 180 V nickel-cadmium pack consisted of 30 [[Saft Groupe S.A.|SAFT]] STM5-180 6 V 180 Ah batteries in six removable pods under the floor of the car, delivering over {{convert|50|mi|km}} of range, and used an automatic watering system for easy battery maintenance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The nickel-iron pack consisted of 30 Eagle-Pitcher 6 V 200 Ah batteries in six pods under the floor and delivered over {{convert|60|mi|km}} of range. The TEVan owner's manual stated {{convert|80|mi|km}} of range.  The TEVan's on-board charger was a PFC Martin-Marietta and accepted 120 V AC@20 A or 40 A, 240 V AC@20 A or 40 A, and as high as 220 V AC@40 A three-phase inputs.

The TEVan had an 8.8&amp;nbsp;kW three-stage ceramic [[electric heater]]. The 120 A DC/DC converter provided all the 12 V power, there was no auxiliary (12 V) battery. [[Dashboard#Dashboard items|Gauges]] included motor temperature and SOC (state of charge, akin to "Fuel Level") using the stock instruments. It was also equipped with electric [[air conditioning]] (R-134a), regenerative braking, power brakes using a Delco electric vacuum pump, [[power steering]], [[Radio|AM/FM Stereo]], and [[airbag]]s. The original equipment tires were LRR, (Low Rolling Resistance), Goodyear P205/75R15 Momentum at 50 PSI.

As a successor, Chrysler would produce the 1997-1999 EPIC (Electric Powered Interurban Commuter Vehicle), based upon the third-generation minivans.

}}The '''Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency''' is a 1986 [[multilateral treaty|treaty]] of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) whereby states have agreed to provide notification to the IAEA of any assistance that they can provide in the case of a [[nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear accident]] that occurs in another state that has ratified the treaty. Along with the [[Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident]], it was adopted in direct response to the April 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]].

The Convention was concluded and signed at a special session of the IAEA general conference on 26 September 1986; the special session was called because of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], which had occurred five months before. Significantly, the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Ukrainian SSR]]—the states that were responsible for the Chernobyl disaster—both signed the treaty at the conference and quickly ratified it. It was signed by 68 states and the Convention entered into force on 26 February 1987 after the third ratification.

As of 2016, there are 112 states that have ratified or acceded to the Convention, plus the [[European Atomic Energy Community]], the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], the [[World Health Organization]], and the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. The states that have signed the Convention but not ratified it are Afghanistan, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, [[Holy See]], Niger, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria, and Zimbabwe. The states that have ratified the Convention but have since denounced it and withdrawn from the agreement are Bulgaria, Hungary, Mongolia, and Poland.

'''''De Historia Piscium''''', [[Latin]] for "The History of Fish," was a scientific book written by [[Francis Willughby]] and published by the [[Royal Society]] in 1686. It was unpopular and sold poorly, causing severe strain on the finances of the society.&lt;ref name=gribbin2002&gt;John Gribbin, ''Science, a History, 1543-2001'', Allen Lane (New York, NY), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the society being unable to meet its promise to finance the publication of the very wealthy [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' ("''Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy''", better known simply as ''Principia''), leaving this to [[Edmond Halley]], who was then the clerk of the society.&lt;ref name=gribbin2002 /&gt; After Halley had personally financed the publication of ''Principia'', he was informed that the society could no longer afford to provide him the promised annual salary of £50. Instead, the similarly wealthy Halley was paid with left-over copies of ''De Historia Piscium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bill Bryson|title=A Short History of Nearly Everything|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKHLD9qNs64C|year=2004|publisher=Random House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-385-66004-4|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17507">'''Electric power quality''', or simply '''power quality''', involves voltage, frequency, and waveform. Good power quality can be defined as a steady supply voltage that stays within the prescribed range, steady a.c. frequency close to the rated value, and smooth voltage curve waveform (resembles a sine wave). In general, it is useful to consider power quality as the '''compatibility between what comes out of an electric outlet and the load that is plugged into it'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Von Meier |first=Alexandra |title=Electric power systems: a conceptual introduction |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=2006 |isbn= |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is used to describe electric power that drives an [[electrical load]] and the load's ability to function properly. Without the proper power, an electrical device (or load) may malfunction, fail prematurely or not operate at all. There are many ways in which electric power can be of poor quality and many more causes of such poor quality power.

The [[electric power industry]] comprises [[electricity generation]] ([[AC power]]), [[electric power transmission]] and ultimately [[electric power distribution]] to an [[electricity meter]] located at the premises of the end user of the electric power. The [[electricity]] then moves through the wiring system of the end user until it reaches the load. The complexity of the system to move electric energy from the point of production to the point of consumption combined with variations in weather, generation, demand and other factors provide many opportunities for the quality of supply to be compromised.

While "power quality" is a convenient term for many, it is the quality of the [[voltage]]—rather than power or [[electric current]]—that is actually described by the term.  Power is simply the flow of energy and the current demanded by a load is largely uncontrollable.

[[File:Variation of utility frequency.svg|thumb|Frequency stability of some large electrical grids]]

==Introduction==
The quality of electrical power may be described as a set of values of parameters, such as:

* [[Continuity of service]]  (Whether the electrical power is subject to voltage drops or overages below or above a threshold level thereby causing blackouts or brownouts&lt;ref&gt;Energy Storage Association&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Variation in voltage magnitude (see below)
* [[Transient (oscillation)|Transient]] voltages and currents
* [[Harmonics (electrical power)|Harmonic]] content in the waveforms for AC power

It is often useful to think of power quality as a [[:wikt:compatibility|compatibility]] problem: is the equipment connected to the grid compatible with the events on the grid, and is the power delivered by the grid, including the events, compatible with the equipment that is connected?  Compatibility problems always have at least two solutions: in this case, either clean up the power, or make the equipment tougher.

The tolerance of data-processing equipment to voltage variations is often characterized by the [[International Committee for Information Technology Standards#CBEMA Curve|CBEMA curve]], which give the duration and magnitude of voltage variations that can be tolerated.&lt;ref name="pge_volts"&gt;[http://www.pge.com/includes/docs/pdfs/mybusiness/customerservice/energystatus/powerquality/voltage_tolerance.pdf pge.com – A utility pamphlet illustrating the CBEMA curve]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CBEMA Curve.png|thumb|center|CBEMA Curve]]

Ideally, AC voltage is supplied by a utility as [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] having an amplitude and frequency given by national standards (in the case of [[mains electricity|mains]]) or system specifications (in the case of a power feed not directly attached to the mains) with an [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of zero [[ohm]]s at all [[Frequency|frequencies]].

==Power Quality Deviations==
No real-life power source is ideal and generally can deviate in at least the following ways:

===Voltage===
* Variations in the [[amplitude|peak]] or [[Root mean square|RMS]] voltage are both important to different types of equipment.
* When the RMS voltage exceeds the nominal voltage by 10 to 80% for 0.5 cycle to 1 minute, the event is called a "swell".
* A "dip" (in British English) or a "sag" (in American English the two terms are equivalent) is the opposite situation: the RMS voltage is below the nominal voltage by 10 to 90% for 0.5 cycle to 1 minute.
* Random or repetitive variations in the [[Root mean square|RMS]] voltage between 90 and 110% of nominal can produce a phenomenon known as "[[Power line flicker|flicker]]" in lighting equipment.  Flicker is rapid visible changes of light level.  Definition of the characteristics of voltage fluctuations that produce objectionable light flicker has been the subject  of ongoing research.
* Abrupt, very brief increases in voltage, called "[[Voltage spike|spikes]]", "impulses", or "surges", generally caused by large [[electric motor|inductive loads]] being turned off, or more severely by [[lightning]].
*"Undervoltage" occurs when the nominal voltage drops below 90% for more than 1 minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/897338163|title=Distributed photovoltaic grid transformers|last=Madhusudan|first=Shertukde, Hemchandra|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=1482247194|location=|pages=91|oclc=897338163|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "brownout" is an apt description for voltage drops somewhere between full power (bright lights) and a blackout (no power – no light). It comes from the noticeable to significant dimming of regular incandescent lights, during system faults or overloading etc., when insufficient power is available to achieve full brightness in (usually) domestic lighting. This term is in common usage has no formal definition but is commonly used to describe a reduction in system voltage by the utility or system operator to decrease demand or to increase system operating margins.
* "[[Overvoltage]]" occurs when the nominal voltage rises above 110% for more than 1 minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/897338163|title=Distributed photovoltaic grid transformers|last=Madhusudan|first=Shertukde, Hemchandra|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=1482247194|location=|pages=91|oclc=897338163|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequency===
* Variations in the [[utility frequency|frequency]].
* Nonzero low-frequency [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (when a load draws more power, the voltage drops).
* Nonzero high-frequency impedance (when a load demands a large amount of current, then stops demanding it suddenly, there will be a dip or [[Voltage spike|spike]] in the voltage due to the inductances in the power supply line).
* Variations in the wave shape – usually described as [[Harmonics (electrical power)|harmonics]] at lower frequencies (usually less than 3&amp;nbsp;kHz) and described as Common Mode Distortion or Interharmonics at higher frequencies.

===Waveform===
* The oscillation of voltage and current ideally follows the form of a sine or cosine function, however it can alter due to imperfections in the generators or loads.
* Typically, generators cause voltage distortions and loads cause current distortions. These distortions occur as oscillations more rapid than the nominal frequency, and are referred to as harmonics. 
* The relative contribution of harmonics to the distortion of the ideal waveform is called total harmonic distortion (THD). 
* Low harmonic content in a waveform is ideal because harmonics can cause vibrations, buzzing, equipment distortions, and losses and overheating in transformers.

Each of these power quality problems has a different cause. Some problems are a result of the shared infrastructure. For example, a fault on the network may cause a dip that will affect some customers; the higher the level of the fault, the greater the number affected. A problem on one customer’s site may cause a transient that affects all other customers on the same subsystem. Problems, such as harmonics, arise within the customer’s own installation and may propagate onto the network and affect other customers. Harmonic problems can be dealt with by a combination of good design practice and well proven reduction equipment.

==Power conditioning==
[[Power conditioner|Power conditioning]] is modifying the power to improve its quality.

An [[uninterruptible power supply]] can be used to switch off of mains power if there is a [[Transient (oscillation)|transient]] (temporary) condition on the line.  However, cheaper UPS units create poor-quality power themselves, akin to imposing a higher-frequency and lower-[[amplitude]] [[square wave]] atop the sine wave.  High-quality UPS units utilize a double conversion topology which breaks down incoming AC power into DC, charges the batteries, then remanufactures an AC sine wave.  This remanufactured sine wave is of higher quality than the original AC power feed.&lt;ref name="dcf_power_quality"&gt;[http://www.datacenterfix.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=68 datacenterfix.com - A Power Quality discussion on UPS design]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Dynamic Voltage Regulator '''(DVR)''' and [[static synchronous series compensator]] or '''(SSSC)''' are utilized for series voltage sag compensation.

A [[surge protector]] or simple [[capacitor]] or [[varistor]] can protect against most overvoltage conditions, while a [[lightning arrester]] protects against severe spikes.

[[Electronic filter]]s can remove harmonics.

==Smart grids and power quality==

Modern systems use sensors called [[phasor measurement unit]]s (PMU) distributed throughout their network to monitor power quality and in some cases respond automatically to them.  Using such [[smart grid]]s features of rapid sensing and automated self healing of anomalies in the network promises to bring higher quality power and less downtime while simultaneously supporting power from [[intermittent power sources]] and [[distributed generation]], which would if unchecked degrade power quality.

==Power quality compression algorithm==
A '''power quality compression algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] used in the analysis of power quality.  To provide high quality electric power service, it is essential to monitor the quality of the electric signals also termed as power quality (PQ) at different locations along an electrical [[Electrical network|power network]]. Electrical utilities carefully monitor waveforms and currents at various network locations constantly, to understand what lead up to any unforeseen events such as a [[power outage]] and blackouts.  This is particularly critical at sites where the environment and public safety are at risk (institutions such as hospitals, sewage treatment plants, mines, etc.).

===Power quality challenges===
Engineers have at their disposal many meters,&lt;ref&gt;Galli et al.: Exploring the power of wavelet analysis?: Oct 1996, IEEE, IEEE Computer Applications in Power, vol. 9, issue 4, pp. 37-41 [http://www.ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=539845]&lt;/ref&gt; that are able to read and display electrical power waveforms and calculating parameters of the waveforms.  These parameters may include, for example, [[Electric current|current]] and [[voltage]] RMS, phase relationship between waveforms of a multi-phase signal, [[power factor]], [[Utility frequency|frequency]], [[Total harmonic distortion|THD]], active power (kW), reactive power (kVAr), apparent power (kVA) and active energy (kWh), reactive energy (kVArh) and apparent energy (kVAh) and many more.  In order to sufficiently monitor unforeseen events, Ribeiro et al.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro et al.:  An enhanced data compression method for applications in power quality analysis? Nov. 29-Dec. 2, 2001, IEEE, The 27th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 2001. IECON '01, vol. 1, pp. 676-681.[http://www.ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=976594]&lt;/ref&gt; explains that it is not enough to display these parameters, but to also capture voltage waveform data at all times.  This is impracticable due to the large amount of data involved, causing what is known the “bottle effect”. For instance, at a sampling rate of 32 samples per cycle, 1,920 samples are collected per second. For three-phase meters that measure both voltage and current waveforms, the data is 6-8 times as much. More practical solutions developed in recent years store data only when an event occurs (for example, when high levels of power system [[harmonics]] are detected) or alternatively to store the [[Alternating current|RMS]] value of the electrical signals.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro et al.: An improved method for signal processing and compression in power quality evaluation? Apr. 2004, IEEE, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, vol. 19, issue 2, pp. 464-471.[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1270480]&lt;/ref&gt; This data, however, is not always sufficient to determine the exact nature of problems.

===Raw data compression ===
Nisenblat ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |inventor1-last=Nisenblat |inventor1-first=Pol |inventor2-last=Broshi |inventor2-first=Amir M. |inventor3-last=Efrati |inventor3-first=Ofir |title=Power Quality Monitoring |issue-date=September 21, 2006 |publication-date=April 18, 2004 |country-code=US |patent-number=7415370}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes the idea of power quality compression algorithm (similar to [[lossy compression]] methods) that enables meters to continuously store the waveform of one or more power signals, regardless whether or not an event of interest was identified. This algorithm referred to as PQZip empowers a processor with a memory that is sufficient to store the waveform, under normal power conditions, over a long period of time, of at least a month, two months or even a year. The compression is performed in real time, as the signals are acquired; it calculates a compression decision before all the compressed data is received. For instance should one parameter remain constant, and various others fluctuate, the compression decision retains only what is relevant from the constant data, and retains all the fluctuation data.  It then decomposes the waveform of the power signal of numerous components, over various periods of the waveform.  It concludes the process by compressing the values of at least some of these components over different periods, separately. This real time compression algorithm, performed independent of the sampling, prevents data gaps and has a typical 1000:1 compression ratio.

=== Aggregated data compression  ===
A typical function of a [[power analyzer]] is generation of data archive aggregated over given interval. Most typically 10 minute or 1 minute interval is used as specified by the IEC/IEEE PQ standards. A significant archive sizes are created during an operation of such instrument. As Kraus ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, Jan; Tobiska, Tomas; Bubla, Viktor; "Lossless encodings and compression algorithms applied on power quality datasets," Electricity Distribution - Part 1, 2009. CIRED 2009. 20th International Conference and Exhibition on , vol., no., pp.1-4, 8–11 June 2009
URL: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5255775&amp;isnumber=5255237&lt;/ref&gt; have demonstrated  the compression ratio on such archives using [[Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm]], [[bzip]] or other similar [[lossless compression]] algorithms can be significant. By using prediction and modeling on the stored time series in the actual power quality archive the efficiency of post processing compression is usually further improved. This combination of simplistic techniques implies savings in both data storage and data acquisition processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6994">The '''Energy Commission''' ({{lang-ms|Suruhanjaya Tenaga}}), abbreviated '''ST''', was created under the Energy Commission Act 2001 as a new regulator for the [[energy]] industry in [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Sabah]]. The Commission was established to ensure that the [[energy industry]] is developed in an efficient manner so that Malaysia is ready to meet the new challenges of globalisation and liberalisation, particularly in the [[energy supply]] industry.

The commission regulates and promotes all matters relating to the [[electricity]] and [[natural gas|gas]] supply industry within the scope of applicable [[legislation]] namely Electricity Supply Act 1990,  License Supply Regulation 1990, Gas Supply Act 1993, Electricity Regulation 1994, and Gas Supply Regulation 1997. In performing its role the commission takes the [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]] approach.&lt;ref name="st"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Energy Commission| url=http://www.st.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2392&amp;Itemid=1229 | work= The Energy Commission of Malaysia | publisher= | date=26 June 2007 | accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECA2001"&gt;{{cite web | title=Energy Commission Act 2001 | url=http://www.parlimen.gov.my/actindexbi/pdf/ACT-610.pdf | work= | publisher=Enacted by the Parliament of Malaysia | date= | accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to [[privatisation]] in 1990, the responsibility for planning and operation of the electricity supply industry in [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Sabah]] vested in the National Electricity Board and the Sabah Electricity Board respectively while the Electrical Inspectorate Department, under the Ministry of Energy was responsible for licensing of [[Independent Power Producer|private generation]] and the safety of electrical installations and equipment. Whereas in [[Sarawak]], the [[Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation]] (SESCO) was the supply authority while the State Inspectorate was responsible for licensing and safety matters in the state.

In 1990, the Electrical Inspectorate Department was abolished and the Department of Electricity Supply formed under the Electricity Supply Act 1990 as the industry and safety regulator of the electricity supply industry in Peninsular and Sabah. However, in Sarawak, the State Electricity Ordinance is still in force providing the State Electrical Inspectorate with the legal power to continue with its regulatory functions.

In 1993, the Department of Gas Supply under the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister’s]] Department was formed for regulating the gas distribution industry. The Director General of Electricity Supply was also appointed as the Director General of Gas Supply. Administratively, the two departments are jointly known as the Department of Electricity and Gas Supply.

With the anticipation of industry [[deregulation]], the Energy Commission Act 2001 was approved by the [[Parliament of Malaysia|parliament]] to take over the functions of the Department of Electricity and Gas Supply. The Energy Commission was established under this act on 1 May 2001 and became fully operational on 2 January 2002.

==Roles and Responsibilities==
The Energy Commission is the regulator for the electricity and gas supply industry based on the powers provided by the Energy Commission Act 2001&lt;ref name="ECA2001" /&gt; and other related acts.&lt;ref name="st" /&gt; The following are the roles and responsibilities identified by the Energy Commission:

*'''[[Regulatory economics|Economic regulation]]''', which includes to promote efficiency and economy in the [[Electricity generation|generation]], [[Natural gas processing|production]], [[Electric power transmission|transmission]], [[Electricity distribution|distribution]], supply and the use of electricity and in the gas supply industry and the use of gas supply through [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]]; promoting and safeguarding competition; enabling fair and efficient market conduct or, in the absence of a competitive market, to prevent the misuse of [[monopoly]] or market power in respect of the generation, production, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity and the gas supply industry. It also includes licensing, enforcement of license conditions for licensee and application providers and ensuring compliance to rules and performance/service quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=EC Roles and Responsibilities | url=http://www.st.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2452&amp;Itemid=1230 | work=Suruhanjaya Tenaga | publisher= | date=14 August 2007 | accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Tariff''', to ensure that [[electricity tariff]] in the country reflect fair pricing which is affordable to consumers and less costly to [[Manufacturing|production]] industries and [[Business|commercial]] enterprises, while allowing a reasonable profit to the [[Electric utility|utility]].
*'''Technical regulation''', to achieve secure, reliable, safe system and realisation of fair and transparent conduct of [[National Grid, Malaysia|the grid]] and distribution operator, the development and enforcement of technical codes and standards.
*'''Consumer protection''', which emphasizes the empowerment of consumers while at the same time ensures adequate protection measures in areas such as [[dispute resolution]], affordability of services and service availability.
*'''Safety regulation''', to protect person(s) from dangers arising from the generation, production, transmission, generation, distribution, supply and use of electricity as provided under the electricity supply laws, arising from the supply of gas through pipelines, and the use of gas as provided under gas supply laws.

North Korea energy production in relation to population was about same as is in [[South Korea]] in 2004–2009. The difference is in the energy import. North Korea is almost self-sufficient in energy. The energy import is very small in North Korea and 86% of primary energy use in South Korea. North Korea's population in 2009 was 23,91 million, and 48,75 million in South Korea.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Per capita electricity consumption==
According to statistics compiled by the South Korean agency, Statistics Korea, based on [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) data, per capita electricity consumption fell from its peak in 1990 of 1247 kilowatt hours to a low of 712 kilowatt hours in 2000. It has slowly risen since to 819 kilowatt hours in 2008, a level below that of 1970.&lt;ref name=DNK8612&gt;{{cite news|title=Economic Collapse Reflected in Scarce Electricity |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&amp;num=9629 |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |newspaper=Daily NK |date=August 6, 2012 |author=Kim Tae Hong |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904031624/http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&amp;num=9629 |archivedate=September 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YN8612&gt;{{cite news|title=N.

[[Image:Copra - coconut oil mill.JPG|thumb|right|[[Coconut oil]] is expelled from [[copra]] at an [[oil mill]] in [[Tripunithura]], [[Kerala]], [[India]]]]
'''Expeller pressing''' (also called '''oil pressing''') is a mechanical method for extracting [[oil]] from raw materials. The raw materials are squeezed under high pressure in a single step.  When used for the extraction of food oils, typical raw materials are [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[seeds]] and [[algae]], which are supplied to the press in a continuous feed. As the raw material is pressed, friction causes it to heat up; in the case of harder nuts (which require higher pressures) the material can exceed temperatures of {{convert|120|F}}.

==Overview==
An expeller press is a screw-type machine that mainly presses oil seeds through a caged barrel-like cavity. Other materials used with an expeller press include but are not limited to meat by-products, [[synthetic rubber]] and animal feeds. Raw materials enter one side of the press and waste products exit the other side.  The machine uses friction and continuous pressure from the screw drives to move and compress the seed material. The oil seeps through small openings that do not allow seed fiber solids to pass through. Afterward, the pressed seeds are formed into a hardened cake, which is removed from the machine. Pressure involved in expeller pressing creates heat in the range of {{convert|140|-|210|F|C}}. Some companies claim that they use a cooling apparatus to reduce this temperature to protect certain properties of the oils being extracted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectrumorganics.com/?id=32 Spectrum Expeller Pressed vs. Cold Pressed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficiency==
Expeller processing cannot remove every last trace of liquid (usually oil) from the raw material. A significant amount remains trapped inside of the cake left over after pressing.  In most small-scale rural situations this is of little or no importance, as the cake that remains after the oil has been removed finds uses in local dishes, in the manufacture of secondary products, or for animal feed. Some raw materials, however, do not release oil by simple expelling, the most notable being [[rice]] [[bran]]. In order to remove oil from commodities that do not respond to expelling or to extract the final traces of oil after expelling, it is necessary to use [[solvent extraction]].

==Design==

===Continuous screw===
The earliest expeller presses utilized a continuous screw design.  The compression screws were much like the screws of a [[screw conveyor]]—that is, the [[helicoid]] flighting started at one end and ended at the other.

===Interrupted screw===
Valerius Anderson invented the interrupted screw design and patented it in the year 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6550376/description.html Twin screw press with interrupted flights - US Patent 6550376 Description&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson observed that in the continuous flighting arrangement of a compression screw, there are tendencies for slippery materials either to co-rotate with the screw or to pass through with minimal dewatering. He wrote that "[[brewer]]s' slops, [[slaughterhouse]] refuse" and other "soft and mushy" materials dewater poorly in continuous screw presses.

His invention consisted of putting interruptions in the flighting of a compression screw. It was much like having a hanger bearing in a screw conveyor: there is no flighting on the shaft at that point, so material tends to stop moving and pile up. It is only after solids accumulate in the gap that the downstream flighting catches material. When this happens, material is forced along its way. The result is better dewatering and thus a more consistent press cake.

===Resistor teeth===
After the 1900 patent, a major improvement was made with the addition of resistor teeth. Fitted into the gaps where there is no flighting, these teeth increase the agitation within the press, further diminishing co-rotation tendencies.

==Expanded applications==
As the years went by, applications of the interrupted screw design were expanded beyond slippery and slimy materials. This took place because competing continuous screw presses worked best only under conditions of constant feed, at constant consistency. If either the consistency or the flow rate diminished, squeezing would diminish until it was inadequate for proper moisture removal. At the same time, if the consistency increased, the press could jam. To counteract these tendencies it was necessary to build a very heavy press, frequently with an expensive variable speed drive.

In contrast, it was found that the interruptions in the flighting of the Anderson screw would provide cushion within the press. If consistency went down, compression was still effective. A plug of sufficiently solid material had to build up at each interruption before solids could progress towards the discharge. This self-correcting performance prevents wet material from purging at the cake discharge. It is achieved without varying the speed of the screw.

The economic advantages of these characteristics led to interrupted screw presses being used to dewater fibrous materials that are neither slippery nor slimy. Examples would be [[alfalfa]], [[corn]] [[husk]], and, more recently, [[paper mill]] fibers.

'''FR-2''' ('''Flame Resistant 2''') is a [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association|NEMA]] designation for '''synthetic resin bonded paper''', a [[composite material]] made of [[paper]] impregnated with a plasticized [[phenol formaldehyde resin]], used in the manufacture of [[printed circuit board]]s. Its main properties are similar to NEMA grade XXXP (MIL-P-3115) material, and can be substituted for the latter in many applications.

== Applications ==
FR-2 sheet with copper foil lamination on one or both sides is widely used to build low-end [[consumer electronics|consumer electronic]] equipment. While its electrical and mechanical properties are inferior to those of epoxy-bonded fiberglass, [[FR-4]], it is significantly cheaper. It is not suitable for devices installed in vehicles, as continuous vibration can make cracks propagate, causing hairline fractures in copper circuit traces. Without copper foil lamination, FR-2 is sometimes used for simple structural shapes and electrical insulation.

== Fabrication ==
FR-2 can be machined by drilling, sawing, milling and hot punching. Cold punching and shearing are not recommended, as they leave a ragged edge and tend to cause cracking. Tools made of high-speed steel can be used, although [[tungsten carbide]] tooling is preferred for high volume production.

Adequate ventilation or respiration protection are mandatory during high-speed machining, as it gives off toxic vapors.

'''Friedel's salt''' is an [[anion exchanger]] mineral belonging to the family of the [[layered double hydroxides]] (LDHs). It has affinity for anions as chloride and iodide and is capable to retain them to a certain extent in its crystallographical structure.

==Composition==

Friedel's salt general formula is:

:Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(Cl,&amp;nbsp;OH)&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

In the [[cement chemist notation]], considering that

:2&amp;nbsp;OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;↔&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O,

and doubling all the stoichiometry, it can also be written as follows:

:3CaO·Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Friedel's salt can also be considered as an [[AFm phase|AF&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; phase]] in which chloride ions have replaced sulfate ions and is formed in cements initially rich in [[Tricalcium aluminate|tri-calcium aluminate]] (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A).

:2 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 3CaO·Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  3CaO·Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

It plays a main role in the retention of chloride anions in cement and concrete. However, Friedel's salt remains a poorly understood phase in the CaO-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O system, and is critical for the stability of salt-saturated Portland cement-based grouts.

==Discovery==

Friedel's salt discovery is relatively difficult to trace back from the recent literature, simply because it is an ancient finding of a poorly known and non-natural product. It has been synthesised and identified in 1897 by [[Georges Friedel]], mineralogist and crystallographer, son of the famous French chemist [[Charles Friedel]].&lt;ref name="Friedel1897"&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://archive.org/stream/bulletindelasoc16mingoog/bulletindelasoc16mingoog_djvu.txt | first = Georges | last = Friedel | title = Sur un chloro-aluminate de calcium hydrate´ se maclant par compression | journal  = Bulletin de la Société française de minéralogie et de cristallographie | volume = 19 | date = 1897 | pages = 122&amp;ndash;136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georges Friedel also synthesised [[Calcium aluminate]] (1903) in the framework of his work on the [[Macle]]s theory (twin crystals). This point requires further verification.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;[http://www.annales.org/archives/x/gfriedel.html Biography of Georges Friedel by F.

'''Garbage''', '''trash''', '''rubbish''', or '''refuse''' is [[waste]] material that is discarded by humans, usually due to a perceived lack of utility. The term generally does not encompass bodily waste products, purely liquid or gaseous wastes, nor [[toxic waste]] products. Garbage is commonly sorted and classified into kinds of material suitable for specific kinds of disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Strasser, ''Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash'' (2014), p. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
What constitutes garbage is highly subjective, with some individuals or societies tending to discard things that others find useful or restorable.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Strasser, ''Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash'' (2014), p. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The words garbage, refuse, rubbish, trash, and waste are generally treated as interchangeable when used to describe "substances or objects which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard".&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Baptista, ''The Regulation of Water and Waste Services'' (2014), p. 1: "Solid waste, also written as municipal or urban waste, commonly known as trash, garbage, refuse or rubbish, is defined as any substances or objects which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Viney, ''Waste: A Philosophy of Things'' (2014), p. 1: "The conventional way of thinking about the creation of waste, rubbish, trash, garbage, or whichever words we like to employ to denote things without use, is that the concept like the thing is ''created'', produced through the order or disorder we construe, manufacture or identify in the world".&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these terms have historic distinctions that are no longer present. In the 1880s, material to be disposed of was divided into four general categories: ashes (derived from the burning of coal or wood), garbage, rubbish, and street-sweepings.&lt;ref name="Ciment"&gt;James Ciment, ''Social Issues in America: An Encyclopedia'' (2015), p. 1844-45.&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme of categorization reduced the terms to more specific concepts:

{{quote|Garbage, the technical term for putrescent organic matter such as kitchen or food scraps, was fed to pigs and other livestock or boiled down in a process known as “rendering,” to extract fats, oils, and greases for manufacturing lubricants, or allowed to dry to become commercial fertilizer. Rubbish, a broad category of dry goods  including boxes, bottles, tin cans, or virtually anything made from wood, metal, glass, and cloth, could be transformed into new consumer products through a variety of reclamation methods.&lt;ref name="Ciment"/&gt;}}

The distinction between terms used to describe wet and dry discarded material "was important in the days when cities slopped garbage to pigs, and needed to have the wet material separated from the dry", but has since dissipated.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Rathje, Cullen Murphy, ''Rubbish!: The Archaeology of Garbage'' (2001), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
In urban areas, garbage of all kinds is collected and treated as [[municipal solid waste]]; garbage that is discarded in ways that cause it to end up in the environment, rather than in facilities designed to receive garbage, is considered [[litter]]. Litter is a form of garbage, and municipal solid waste that is improperly disposed of, and which therefore enters the environment, is treated as litter.&lt;ref&gt;Carl A. Zimring, William L. Rathje, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Consumption and Waste: The Social Science of Garbage'' (2012), p. 657.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, however, only a small fraction of garbage that is generated becomes litter, with the vast majority being disposed of in ways intended to secure it from entering the environment.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Rathje, Cullen Murphy, ''Rubbish!: The Archaeology of Garbage'' (2001), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Man has been creating garbage throughout history, beginning with bone fragments left over from using animal parts and stone fragments discarded from toolmaking.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Simon Davis, "By their garbage shall they be known", ''New Scientist'' (November 17, 1983), p. 506-515.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which groups of early humans began engaging in [[agriculture]] can be estimated by examining the type and quality of animal bones in their garbage.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Garbage from prehistoric or pre-civilization humans was often collected into mounds called [[midden]]s, which might contain things such as "a mix of discarded food, charcoal, shell tools, and broken pottery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/2011/03/prehistoric-garbage-piles-may-have-created-tree-islands|author=Sid Perkins|title=Prehistoric Garbage Piles May Have Created 'Tree Islands'|work=sciencemag.org|date=March 22, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624120348/http://news.sciencemag.org/2011/03/prehistoric-garbage-piles-may-have-created-tree-islands|archivedate=June 24, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Prigogine was born in [[Moscow]] a few months before the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] of 1917, into a Jewish family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3-G3vi5av28C&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=prigogine+anti+semitic#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Francis Leroy.

Because the family was critical of the new [[Soviet Union|Soviet system]], they left Russia in 1921. They first went to [[Germany]] and in 1929, to [[Belgium]], where Prigogine received Belgian nationality in 1949. His brother [[Alexandre Prigogine|Alexandre]] (1913–1991) became an ornithologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Alexandre Prigogine (1913–1991)|pages=89–90|author=Louette, Michel|journal=Ibis|volume=134|year=1992|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1992.tb07238.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prigogine studied [[chemistry]] at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]], where in 1950, he became professor. In 1959, he was appointed director of the [[Solvay Conference|International Solvay Institute]] in Brussels, Belgium. In that year, he also started teaching at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in the [[United States]], where he later was appointed Regental Professor and Ashbel Smith Professor of Physics and Chemical Engineering. From 1961 until 1966 he was affiliated with the [[Enrico Fermi]] Institute at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Todd May|title=Emerging Trends in Continental Philosophy|date=September 11, 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317546784|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Austin, in 1967, he co-founded the Center for Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, now the [[Center for Complex Quantum Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2003/05/28/nr_prigogine/|title=Nobel Prize-winning physical chemist dies in Brussels at age 86|publisher=Utexas.edu|date=2003-05-28|accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, he also returned to Belgium, where he became director of the Center for Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics.

He was a member of numerous scientific organizations, and received numerous awards, prizes and 53 honorary degrees. In 1955, Ilya Prigogine was awarded the [[Francqui Prize]] for Exact Sciences. For his study in [[irreversibility|irreversible]] [[thermodynamics]], he received the [[Rumford Medal]] in 1976, and in 1977, the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]]. In 1989, he was awarded the title of [[Viscount]] in the [[Belgian nobility]] by the [[King of the Belgians]]. Until his death, he was president of the [[International Academy of Science, Munich]] and was in 1997, one of the founders of the International Commission on Distance Education (CODE), a worldwide accreditation agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias-icsd.org/history.html|title=History – International Academy of Science, Munich|author=|date=|website=www.ias-icsd.org|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias-icsd.org/resources/ICSD-IAS-Presidium.pdf International Council for Scientific Development. Presidium]. ias-icsd.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 he was awarded an ''[[honoris causa]]'' doctorate by the [[UNAM]] in [[Mexico City]].

Prigogine was first married to Belgian poet Hélène Jofé (as an author also known as Hélène Prigogine) and in 1945 they had a son Yves. After their divorce, he married Polish-born [[chemist]] Maria Prokopowicz (also known as Maria Prigogine) in 1961. In 1970 they had a son Pascal.&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Prigogine. (2003).

Prigogine received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1985 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|website=www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Prigogine is best known for his definition of [[dissipative structures]] and their role in [[thermodynamic system]]s far from [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], a discovery that won him the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry in 1977. In summary, Ilya Prigogine discovered that importation and dissipation of energy into chemical systems could result in the emergence of new structures (hence dissipative structures) due to internal self reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P. T. Macklem|title=Emergent phenomena and the secrets of life|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=3 April 2008|volume=104|issue=6|pages=1844–1846|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00942.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1955 text, Prigogine drew connections between dissipative structures and the Rayleigh-Benard instability and the Turing mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;I. Prigogine, ''Introduction to Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes'', Charles C. Thomas Publisher, Springfield, Illinois, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissipative structures theory===
Dissipative structure theory led to pioneering research in [[self-organizing system]]s, as well as philosophical inquiries into the formation of complexity on biological entities and the quest for a creative and irreversible role of time in the [[natural science]]s. See the criticism by Joel Keizer and Ronald Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joel Keizer and Ronald Fox |date=January 1974 |title=Qualms Regarding the Range of Validity of the Glansdorff-Prigogine Criterion for Stability of Non-Equilibrium States |pmc=387963 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=192–196 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.71.1.192|pmid=16592132|bibcode=1974PNAS...71..192K }} Also [https://www.academia.edu/564038/Qualms_regarding_the_range_of_validity_of_the_Glansdorff-Prigogine_criterion_for_stability_of_non-equilibrium_states on Academia.edu]. Retrieved 16 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

With professor [[Robert Herman]], he also developed the basis of the [[two fluid model]], a traffic model in [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]] for urban networks, analogous to the two fluid model in classical statistical mechanics.

Prigogine's formal concept of [[self-organization]] was used also as a "complementary bridge" between [[General Systems Theory]] and [[thermodynamics]], conciliating the cloudiness of some important systems theory concepts{{which|date=December 2013}} with scientific rigour.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Work on unsolved problems in physics===
{{see also|Unsolved problems in physics}}
In his later years, his work concentrated on the fundamental role of [[indeterminism]] in [[nonlinear dynamics|nonlinear systems]] on both the [[classical physics|classical]] and [[quantum physics|quantum]] level. Prigogine and coworkers proposed a [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville space]] extension of quantum mechanics. A Liouville space is the [[vector space]] formed by the set of (self-adjoint) [[linear operator]]s, equipped with an inner product, that act on a [[Hilbert space]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregg Jaeger: ''Quantum Information: An Overview'', Springer, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-387-35725-6}}, Chapter B.3 "Lioville space and open quantum systems", [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0ho97k7S4oC&amp;pg=PA248 p. 248]&lt;/ref&gt; There exists a mapping of each linear operator into Liouville space, yet not every self-adjoint operator of Liouville space has a counterpart in Hilbert space, and in this sense Liouville space has a richer structure than Hilbert space.&lt;ref&gt;T. Sida, K. Saitô, Si Si (eds.): ''Quantum Information and Complexity: Proceedings of the Meijo Winter School, 6–10 January 2003'', World Scientific Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|978-981-256-047-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BQ1MPLxzR4AC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]&lt;/ref&gt; The Liouville space extension proposal by Prigogine and co-workers aimed to solve the [[Entropy (arrow of time)#Current research|arrow of time problem]] of thermodynamics and the [[measurement problem]] of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=T. Petrosky; I. Prigogine|year=1997|title=The Liouville Space Extension of Quantum Mechanics|journal=Adv. Chem. Phys.|series=Advances in Chemical Physics|volume=99|pages=1–120|doi=10.1002/9780470141588.ch1|isbn=978-0-470-14158-8}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-10--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Prigogine co-authored several books with [[Isabelle Stengers]], including ''The End of Certainty'' and ''La Nouvelle Alliance'' (''Order out of Chaos'').

===''The End of Certainty''===
In his 1996 book, ''La Fin des certitudes'', co-authored by [[Isabelle Stengers]] and published in English in 1997 as ''The End of Certainty: Time, Chaos, and the New Laws of Nature'', Prigogine contends that determinism is no longer a viable scientific belief: "The more we know about our universe, the more difficult it becomes to believe in determinism." This is a major departure from the approach of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], all of whom expressed their theories in terms of deterministic equations. According to Prigogine, determinism loses its explanatory power in the face of [[irreversibility]] and [[instability]].{{fact|date=April 2017}}

Prigogine traces the dispute over determinism back to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], whose attempt to explain individual variability according to evolving populations inspired [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] to explain the behavior of gases in terms of populations of particles rather than individual particles.{{sfnp|Prigogine|Stengers|1997|p=19–20}} This led to the field of [[statistical mechanics]] and the realization that gases undergo [[irreversible process]]es. In deterministic physics, all processes are time-reversible, meaning that they can proceed backward as well as forward through time. As Prigogine explains, determinism is fundamentally a denial of the [[arrow of time]]. With no arrow of time, there is no longer a privileged moment known as the "present," which follows a determined "past" and precedes an undetermined "future." All of time is simply given, with the future as determined or as undetermined as the past. With irreversibility, the arrow of time is reintroduced to physics. Prigogine notes numerous examples of irreversibility, including [[diffusion]], [[radioactive decay]], [[solar radiation]], [[weather]] and the emergence and evolution of [[life]]. Like weather systems, organisms are unstable systems existing far from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Instability resists standard deterministic explanation. Instead, due to sensitivity to initial conditions, unstable systems can only be explained statistically, that is, in terms of [[probability]].

Prigogine asserts that [[Newtonian physics]] has now been "extended" three times:{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} first with the introduction of spacetime in [[general relativity]], then with the use of the wave function in [[quantum mechanics]], and finally with the recognition of indeterminism in the study of unstable systems ([[chaos theory]]).

The '''Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Asociacion Interamericana para la Defensa del Ambiente'') ('''AIDA''') is a non-profit international [[environmental law]] organization founded in 1996 by a collaboration of five environmental organizations in the Americas including [[Earthjustice]].

AIDA's headquarters is in [[San Francisco, California]]. The organization works internationally with partners in many different countries including [[Argentina]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], and [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;Cederstav, A. Barandiaran, A. (2002). [http://www.aida-americas.org/sites/default/files/La_Oroya_Cannot_Wait_1.pdf "La Oroya Cannot Wait"]. {{ISBN|9972-792-33-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

AIDA works primarily to improve and protect human health and the environment.  AIDA's most notable work has been in [[La Oroya]], Peru where they have fought the poisoning of local people by heavy metals and other contaminants emitted by a local [[smelter]].  AIDA has also made significant impacts protecting the [[Leatherback turtle]] in Costa Rica through a partnership with Cedarena.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, T. (2002). Justice on Earth. Chelsea Green Publishing Company.  {{ISBN|1-931498-31-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
AIDA conducts its efforts according to four basic principles:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aida-americas.org/en/about AIDA: Environmental Law for the Americas]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1. Encourage Transnational Collaboration''' - In many cases, environmental crises can’t be boxed into individual nations. Pesticide spraying in Colombia threatens forests in Ecuador; polluted waters from Bolivia damage fragile wetlands in Brazil; overfishing by boats registered in Panama causes global disruptions in marine ecosystems; and consumer excess in the United States strains environmental resources throughout the hemisphere. AIDA doesn’t let political boundaries dictate the scope of our efforts. We do what it takes to win, no matter how many borders we have to cross along the way.

'''2. Protect human rights''' - Environmental health and human rights are two sides of the same coin. Without the services provided by functioning ecosystems – clean water, breathable air, and productive soil – human communities cannot thrive. When human rights are violated, democracy fails. When significant disparities in economic capacity and political influence are involved, AIDA protects poor communities struggling against powerful corporate or state interests.

'''3. Cultivate the power of international law''' - Many international treaties make lofty promises that lead to little action. Commitments on paper are meaningless without real-world incentives and mechanisms for enforcement. AIDA designs international strategies that lead to measurable results – we hold governments accountable and build the capacity of key players in positions to make a difference.

'''4. Encourage citizen enforcement and public participation''' - Lasting change comes from the ground up. AIDA works to empower the communities and organizations that we represent. Sometimes, governments cannot be relied upon to protect basic environmental and human rights. When the authorities don’t deliver, AIDA helps nonprofit organizations enforce the law.

== Programs ==

AIDA partners with local groups to field multinational teams of lawyers and scientists to tackle a range of environmental and human rights crises – including the decline of freshwater resources, the proliferation of toxins, climate change, and the decimation of vulnerable biodiversity.

AIDA’s efforts are divided into five strategic themes:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aida-americas.org/en/projects AIDA's Work]&lt;/ref&gt;

1. [[Human Rights#Environmental rights|Human Rights and the Environment]]- AIDA works to establish the connection between environmental degradation and harm to under-resourced communities throughout the Americas. When big business moves in to extract natural resources or develop infrastructure, local people are often left with contaminated water, polluted air, and no way to feed their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aida-americas.org/humanrightsprogram AIDA: Human Rights and the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

2. [[Marine Biodiversity]] and Coastal Protection- Marine ecosystems are among the most threatened environmental resources in the Americas. AIDA works to implement legal, administrative, and political strategies to help protect endangered species, encourage the sustainable harvesting of delicate marine resources, and protect coastal areas that provide essential habitat to threatened biodiversity and human communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aida-americas.org/biodiversity Marine Biodiversity and Coastal Protection]&lt;/ref&gt;

3. [[Climate Change]] - Global warming is the most systemic and long-range threat to environmental health. AIDA has recently expanded its efforts to include work on climate change, with a focus on developing legal tools and regulatory frameworks that will help move human societies toward energy sustainability and protect those most harmed by rising sea levels and changing weather patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aida-americas.org/en/climate Climate Change]&lt;/ref&gt;

4. [[Freshwater#Freshwater as a resource|Freshwater Preservation]]- Clean water is a cornerstone of human and environmental health. AIDA implements legal strategies to protect ecosystems that serve as vital freshwater resources for nearby communities and biodiversity. AIDA also works to prevent companies from polluting freshwater supplies with poisonous toxins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aida-americas.org/en/freshwater Freshwater Preservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ship Splendido of captain Ivan Visin.jpg|thumb|''Splendido'']]
'''Ivan "Ivo" Visin''' (1806 - 1868) was a [[navigation|naval captain]] and [[List of explorers|explorer]].

Visin was born in [[Prčanj]], in the [[Bay of Kotor]], then under occupation of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]]. On request of the government of the [[Habsburg]] monarchy, he circumnavigated the globe in a vessel called ''Splendido'' between 1852 and 1859. The journey started in [[Antwerp]] and ended successfully in [[Trieste]]. The ship was 30 m long with 311 [[tonne]]s of cargo. For this undertaking of historical importance for the empire, he had been decorated with a flag of honour ''[[Merito navali]]'' by the Austrian Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]]. The trophy is on display in Birth of Our Lady church in [[Prčanj]]. Later, Visin became an honorary citizen of [[Trieste]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1689">In the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tradition, oaths were sworn upon ''Iuppiter Lapis'' or the '''Jupiter Stone''' located in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter]], [[Capitoline Hill]]. ''Iuppiter Lapis'' was held in the Roman tradition to be an [[Oath Stone]], an aspect of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in his role as divine lawmaker responsible for order and used principally for the investiture of the oathtaking of office.

According to Cyril Bailey, in "The Religion of Ancient Rome" (1907): {{Quote| text=We have, for instance, the sacred stone (''[[Silex#Archaic and foreign uses|silex]]'') which was preserved in the temple of Iuppiter on the Capitol, and was brought out to play a prominent part in the ceremony of treaty-making. The [[fetial]], who on that occasion represented the Roman people, at the solemn moment of the oath-taking, struck the sacrificial pig with the ''silex'', saying as he did so, 'Do thou, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Diespiter]], strike the Roman people as I strike this pig here to-day, and strike them the more, as thou art greater and stronger.' Here no doubt the underlying notion is not merely symbolical, but in origin the stone is itself the god, an idea which later religion expressed in the cult-title specially used in this connection, ''Iuppiter Lapis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Cyril |date=1907 |title=The Religion of Ancient Rome |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18564/18564-h/18564-h.htm#CHAPTER_II |location=London |publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co.

[[File:JürgenGmehling.jpg|thumb|200px|Jürgen Gmehling (2010)]]
'''Jürgen Gmehling''' (born January 13, 1946 in [[Duisburg]]) is a retired&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presse.uni-oldenburg.de/mit/2011/181.html&lt;/ref&gt; German [[professor]] of technical and industrial [[chemistry]] at the [[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]].

==Biography==
His career started with an apprenticeship as a laboratory assistant at the Duisburg copper works&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddbst.com/juergen-gmehling.html|title=Biography from DDBST company web site|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  before he studied chemical engineering at the engineering school in [[Essen]] and then chemistry in [[Dortmund]] and [[Clausthal]]. He received his [[diploma]] from the [[Dortmund University of Technology|University of Dortmund]] in 1970 and his PhD (Dr. rer. nat., [[inorganic chemistry]]) in 1973. After this he worked as a scientific coworker in Dortmund before he became a private lecturer and, after his [[habilitation]], an assistant professor.

Gmehling was appointed a full professor for technical chemistry at the [[University of Oldenburg]] in 1989 and retired in 2011.

==Fields of research==
Gmehling's main focus is the [[process development]]. This includes the development of software for process synthesis and [[process simulation]] as well as measurement, collection, and estimation of thermophysical properties of pure components and component mixtures. The following list summarizes fields of his scientific work but is in no way complete.

===Measurements===
* Phase equilibrium data ([[vapor-liquid equilibria]],&lt;ref&gt;Horstmann S., Fischer K., Gmehling J., "Isothermal Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium and Excess Enthalpy Data for the Binary Systems Water + Sulfolane and Methanol + N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone", J.Chem.Eng.Data, 49(6), 1499–1503, 2004
&lt;/ref&gt; liquid-liquid equilibria, solid–liquid equilibria,&lt;ref&gt;Joh R., Kreutz J., Gmehling J., "Measurement and Prediction of Ternary Solid–Liquid Equilibria", J.Chem.Eng.Data, 42(5), 886–889, 1997
&lt;/ref&gt; gas solubilities, heats of mixing, activity coefficients&lt;ref&gt;Gruber D., Topphoff M., Gmehling J., "Measurement of activity coefficients at infinite dilution using gas-liquid chromatography. 8. Results for 22 solutes in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether and 18 solutes in triethylene glycol dibutyl ether at 303.15 K and 343.15 K", Eldata Int.Electron.J.Phys.-Chem.Data, 3, 215–224, 1997
&lt;/ref&gt; and more)

===Data collection===
Gmehling began in the 1970s with the systematic evaluation of the scientific literature, aiming to build a data bank for vapor-liquid equilibria. These data were needed for the development of a new method for the prediction of activity coefficients named [[UNIFAC]]. This data bank is still named the [[Dortmund Data Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Gmehling J., Weidlich U., "Die Dortmunder Datenbank. Basis für die Weiterentwicklung der UNIFAC-Methode", Chem.Ing.Tech., 57(5), 447–449, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of estimation and correlation models===
Gmehling developed with colleagues models for the estimation of several thermodynamic and thermophysical properties:
* Activity coefficient models like [[UNIFAC]]&lt;ref&gt;Fredenslund Å., Gmehling J., Michelsen M.L., Rasmussen P., Prausnitz J.M., "Computerized Design of Multicomponent Distillation Columns Using the UNIFAC Group Contribution Method for Calculation of Activity Coefficients", Ind.Eng.Chem. Process Des.Dev., 16(4), 450–462, 1977
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weidlich U., Gmehling J., "A Modified UNIFAC Model. 1. Prediction of VLE, hE, and gamma Infinite", Ind.Eng.Chem.Res., 26(7), 1372–1381, 1987
&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[group contribution method]]) and extensions. For the further development of these widely used methods Gmehling founded an [[UNIFAC Consortium|industry consortium]] where many international companies are participating.
* Equations of state (EOS)&lt;ref&gt;Holderbaum T., Gmehling J., "PSRK: A Group-Contribution Equation of State based on UNIFAC", Fluid Phase Equilib., 70, 251–265, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; including mixing rules for applying EOS to mixtures (see [[PSRK]]).

===Software development===
The following implementation of his methods are also developments:
* an expert system&lt;ref&gt;Möllmann C., Gmehling J., "Auswahl selektiver Zusatzstoffe für die Rektifikation durch kombinierten Zugriff auf experimentelle und vorausberechnete Gleichgewichtsdaten", Chem.Ing.Tech., 69(3), 324–328, 1997
&lt;/ref&gt; for the entrainer selection for the azeotropic and extractive distillation

== Awards ==
Gmehling has received some awards:
* Arnold-Eucken Price in 1982 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ddbst.com/juergen-gmehling.html|title=Biography from DDBST company web site|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magnesium diuranate''' (MgU&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) is a compound of [[uranium]]. It is known in the uranium refining industry as "MDU" and forms the major part of some [[yellowcake]] mixtures. Yellowcakes are an intermediate product in the uranium refining process.

To produce this form of yellowcake, crushed ore is mixed with hot water to a 58% solids [[slurry]]. The solids slurry is then processed through a series of tanks, where [[sulfuric acid]], [[sodium chlorate]], and [[steam]] are used to extract the uranium from the solids slurry. The average [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaching]] efficiency for this process is 98.5%. The uranium-bearing solution is then decanted and directed to a solvent extraction (SX) process for further purification. In this extraction step, the dissolved uranium is transferred from the feed solution into the organic solvent. Next a stripping step recovers the uranium into a [[sodium chloride]] aqueous phase after which the barren solvent is recycled.  The average efficiency of the SX circuit is 99.9%. The high-grade “pregnant” strip solution from SX goes to the next stage where [[magnesium oxide|magnesia]] slurry is added to precipitate magnesium diuranate. The yellow cake precipitate is then thickened, dried, re-crushed and packed into industry standard 220 litre steel drums for shipment to customers.

As with all yellowcake process the selection of this end product is dependent on the properties of the ore to be processed.  The point of using magnesia is that you need an alkali and magnesia can be cheap.

{{Standard model of particle physics}}

A '''Majorana fermion''' ({{IPAc-en|m|aɪ|ə|'|r|ɒ|n|ə|_|'|f|ɛər|m|iː|ɒ|n}}&lt;ref name=youtube_pronunciation&gt;{{YouTube| XHUgetdkJmg | "Quantum Computation possible with Majorana Fermions" }}, uploaded 19 April 2013, retrieved 5 October 2014; and also based on [[Ettore Majorana|the physicist's name's pronunciation]].&lt;/ref&gt;), also referred to as a '''Majorana particle''', is a [[fermion]] that is its own [[antiparticle]]. They were hypothesized by [[Ettore Majorana]] in 1937. The term is sometimes used in opposition to a [[Dirac fermion]], which describes fermions that are not their own antiparticles.

With the exception of the [[neutrino]], all of the [[Standard Model]] fermions are known to behave as Dirac fermions at low energy (after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]]), and none are Majorana fermions. The nature of the neutrinos is not settled – they may be either Dirac or Majorana fermions.

In [[condensed matter physics]], bound Majorana fermions can appear as [[quasiparticle]] [[Excited state|excitations]] – the collective movement of several individual particles, not a single one, and they are governed by [[Anyon#Non-abelian anyons|non-abelian statistics]].

== Theory ==
The concept goes back to Majorana's suggestion in 1937&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-48095-2_10 |chapter=A symmetric theory of electrons and positrons |title=Ettore Majorana Scientific Papers |pages=201–33 |year=2006 |last1=Majorana |first1=Ettore |last2=Maiani |first2=Luciano |isbn=978-3-540-48091-4 |editor1-first=Giuseppe Franco |editor1-last=Bassani }} Translated from: {{cite journal |doi=10.1007/bf02961314 |title=Teoria simmetrica dell'elettrone e del positrone |journal=Il Nuovo Cimento |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=171–84 |year=1937 |last1=Majorana |first1=Ettore |language=Italian |bibcode=1937NCim...14..171M }}&lt;/ref&gt; that neutral [[Spin (physics)|spin]]-{{frac|1|2}} particles can be described by a real [[relativistic wave equations|wave equation]] (the [[Majorana equation]]), and would therefore be identical to their antiparticle (because the wave functions of particle and antiparticle are related by [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]]).

The difference between Majorana fermions and Dirac fermions can be expressed mathematically in terms of the [[creation and annihilation operators]] of [[second quantization]]: The creation operator &lt;math&gt;\gamma^{\dagger}_j&lt;/math&gt; creates a fermion in quantum state &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; (described by a ''real'' wave function), whereas the annihilation operator &lt;math&gt;\gamma_j&lt;/math&gt; annihilates it (or, equivalently, creates the corresponding antiparticle). For a Dirac fermion the operators &lt;math&gt;\gamma^{\dagger}_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_j&lt;/math&gt; are distinct, whereas for a Majorana fermion they are identical. The ordinary fermionic annihilation and creation operators &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{\dagger}&lt;/math&gt; can be written in terms of two Majorana operators &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;f=(\gamma_1+i\gamma_2)/\sqrt{2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\dagger}=(\gamma_1-i\gamma_2)/\sqrt{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

In supersymmetry models, [[neutralino]]s — superpartners of gauge bosons and Higgs bosons — are Majorana.

Another common convention for the normalization of the Majorana fermion [[creation and annihilation operators|operator]] is
:&lt;math&gt;f=(\gamma_1+i\gamma_2)/2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f^\dagger=(\gamma_1-i\gamma_2)/2&lt;/math&gt;
This convention has the advantage that the Majorana operator [[idempotence|squares to the identity]].

Using this convention, a collection of Majorana fermions &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;i=1,2,..,n&lt;/math&gt;) obey the following [[commutator|commutation]] identities
*&lt;math&gt;\{\gamma_i,\gamma_j\}=2\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{ijkl} [\gamma_i A_{ij} \gamma_j, \gamma_k B_{kl} \gamma_l]= \sum_{ij}4\gamma_i [A,B]_{ij} \gamma_j &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are [[skew-symmetric matrix|antisymmetric]] matrices.

== Elementary particles ==
Because particles and antiparticles have opposite conserved charges, Majorana fermions have zero charge. All of the elementary fermions of the [[Standard Model]] have gauge charges, so they cannot have fundamental [[Majorana mass]]es.

However, the right-handed [[sterile neutrino]]s introduced to explain [[neutrino oscillation]] could have Majorana masses. If they do, then at low energy (after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]]), by the [[seesaw mechanism]], the neutrino fields would naturally behave as six Majorana fields, with three of them expected to have very high masses (comparable to the [[GUT scale]]) and the other three expected to have very low masses (below 1&amp;nbsp;eV). If right-handed neutrinos exist but do not have a Majorana mass, the neutrinos would instead behave as three [[Dirac fermion]]s and their antiparticles with masses coming directly from the Higgs interaction, like the other Standard Model fermions.
[[File:Ettore Majorana.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ettore Majorana]] hypothesised the existence of Majorana fermions in 1937]]

The seesaw mechanism is appealing because it would naturally explain why the observed neutrino masses are so small. However, if the neutrinos are Majorana then they violate the conservation of [[lepton number]] and even of [[B − L]].

== Majorana bound states ==
In [[Superconductivity|superconducting materials]], Majorana fermions can emerge as (non-fundamental) [[quasiparticle]]s (more commonly referred to as [[Bogoliubov quasiparticles]] in condensed matter physics). This becomes possible because a quasiparticle in a superconductor is its own antiparticle.

Mathematically, the superconductor imposes [[electron hole]] "symmetry" on the quasiparticle excitations, relating the creation operator &lt;math&gt;\gamma(E)&lt;/math&gt; at energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; to the annihilation operator  &lt;math&gt;{\gamma^{\dagger}(-E)}&lt;/math&gt; at energy &lt;math&gt;-E&lt;/math&gt;. Majorana fermions can be bound to a defect at zero energy, and then the combined objects are called Majorana bound states or Majorana zero modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Frank | last = Wilczek | title = Majorana returns | journal = [[Nature Physics]] | volume=5 | pages=614–618 | date=2009 | doi = 10.1038/nphys1380 | url = http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/Wilczek_Nature/Majorana_return434.pdf | issue=9 | bibcode=2009NatPh...5..614W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This name is more appropriate than Majorana fermion (although the distinction is not always made in the literature), because the statistics of these objects is no longer [[Quantum field theory#Fermions|fermionic]]. Instead, the Majorana bound states are an example of [[Anyon#Non-abelian anyons|non-abelian anyons]]: interchanging them changes the state of the system in a way that depends only on the order in which the exchange was performed. The non-abelian statistics that Majorana bound states possess allows them to be used as a building block for a [[topological quantum computer]].&lt;ref name=nayak2008&gt;{{cite journal | title = Non-Abelian anyons and topological quantum computation | journal = [[Reviews of Modern Physics]] | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 1083–1159 | date = 2008 | first1 = Chetan | last1 = Nayak | first2= Steven H. | last2 = Simon | first3 = Ady | last3 = Stern | first4 = Michael | last4 = Freedman | first5 = Sankar | last5 = Das Sarma | bibcode = 2008RvMP...80.1083N |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.80.1083 | arxiv = 0707.1889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 August 2018, a strong evidence for the existence of Majorana bound states (or Majorana anyons) in an [[iron-based superconductor]], which many alternative trivial explanations cannot account for, was reported by researchers in Prof. Gao Hong-jun's team and Prof. Ding Hong's team at Institute of Physics, [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] and [[University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences|University of Chinese Academy of Sciences]], when they used [[scanning tunneling spectroscopy]] on the superconducting Dirac surface state of the iron-based superconductor. It was the first time that Majorana particles were observed in a bulk of pure substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Dongfei|last2=Kong|first2=Lingyuan|last3=Fan|first3=Peng|last4=Chen|first4=Hui|last5=Zhu|first5=Shiyu|last6=Liu|first6=Wenyao|last7=Cao|first7=Lu|last8=Sun|first8=Yujie|last9=Du|first9=Shixuan|date=2018-08-16|title=Evidence for Majorana bound states in an iron-based superconductor|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aao1797|journal=Science|pages=eaao1797|doi=10.1126/science.aao1797|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majorana bound states in quantum error correction===

Majorana bound states can also be realized in quantum [[error correcting code]]s.  This is done by creating so called 'twist defects' in codes such as the [[Toric code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bombin|first1=H.|title=Topological Order with a Twist: Ising Anyons from an Abelian Model|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=14 July 2010|volume=105|issue=3|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.030403|bibcode=2010PhRvL.105c0403B|arxiv=1004.1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; which carry unpaired Majorana modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.92.245139 | volume=92 | title=Demonstrating non-Abelian statistics of Majorana fermions using twist defects | journal=Physical Review B| arxiv=1508.04166 | bibcode=2015PhRvB..92x5139Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The braiding of Majoranas realized in such a way forms a [[projective representation]] of the [[braid group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.87.045130 | volume=87 | title=Twist defects and projective non-Abelian braiding statistics | journal=Physical Review B| arxiv=1208.4834 | bibcode=2013PhRvB..87d5130B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a realization of Majoranas would allow them to be used to store and process [[quantum information]] within a [[Quantum computer|quantum computation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hastings|first1=M.

A '''motor soft starter''' is a device used with [[AC motor|AC electrical motor]]s to temporarily reduce the load and [[torque]] in the [[power train]] and electric current surge of the motor during start-up. This reduces the [[mechanical stress]] on the motor and shaft, as well as the [[electrodynamics|electrodynamic]] stresses on the attached power cables and [[electricity distribution|electrical distribution network]], extending the lifespan of the system.&lt;ref name=Siskind&gt;{{cite book | first=Charles S. | last=Siskind | author link= | year=1963 | title=Electrical Control Systems in Industry | edition= | publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc. | location=New York | isbn= 0-07-057746-3 | page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can consist of mechanical or electrical devices, or a combination of both. Mechanical soft starters include [[clutch]]es and several types of [[coupling]]s using a [[fluid coupling|fluid]], magnetic forces, or steel [[Lead shot|shot]] to transmit torque, similar to other forms of [[torque limiter]]. Electrical soft starters can be any control system that reduces the torque by temporarily reducing the [[voltage]] or [[electric current|current]] input, or a device that temporarily alters how the motor is connected in the [[electric circuit]].
[[File:Digital Soft Starter with Motor Protection and In Built By Pass.jpg|thumb|Digital Soft Starter]]
Across-the line starting of induction motors is accompanied by inrush currents up to 7-10 times higher than running current, and starting torque up to 3 times higher than running torque. The increased torque results in sudden mechanical stress on the machine which leads to a reduced service life. Moreover, the high inrush current stresses the power supply, which may lead to voltage dips. As a result, lifespan  of sensitive equipment may be reduced.&lt;ref name="Siskind" /&gt;

A soft starter eliminates the undesired side effects. Several types based on control of the supply voltage or mechanical devices such as slip clutches were developed. The list provides an overview of the various electric start-up types. The current and torque characteristic curves show the behavior of the respective starter solution.
Torque surges entail high mechanical stress on the machine, which results in higher service costs and increased wear. High currents and current peaks lead to high fixed costs charged by the power supply companies (peak current calculation) and to increased mains and generator loads.

A soft starter continuously controls the three-phase motor’s voltage supply during the start-up phase. This way, the motor is adjusted to the machine’s load behavior. Mechanical operating equipment is accelerated smoothly. This lengthens service life, improves operating behavior, and smooths work flows. Electrical soft starters can use [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] devices to control the [[Electric current|current]] flow and therefore the voltage applied to the motor. They can be connected in [[series circuits|series]] with the line voltage applied to the motor, or can be connected inside the delta (Δ) loop of a [[Y-Δ transform|delta-connected motor]], controlling the voltage applied to each winding. Solid state soft starters can control one or more [[three-phase electric power|phases]] of the voltage applied to the induction motor with the best results achieved by three-phase control. Typically, the voltage is controlled by reverse-[[parallel circuits|parallel]]-connected [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s ([[thyristor]]s), but in some circumstances with three-phase control, the control elements can be a reverse-parallel-connected SCR and [[diode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://machinedesign.com/engineering-essentials/soft-starters|title= Soft starters |publisher=machinedesign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to limit motor starting current is a series [[inductor|reactor]].  If an air core is used for the series reactor then a very efficient and reliable soft starter can be designed which is suitable for all types of 3 phase induction motor [ synchronous / asynchronous ] ranging from 25 kW 415 V to 30 MW 11 kV.  Using an air core series reactor soft starter is very common practice for applications like pump, compressor, fan etc.  Usually high starting torque applications do not use this method.

==Applications==
Soft starters can be set up to the requirements of the individual application. In pump applications, a soft start can avoid pressure surges. Conveyor belt systems can be smoothly started, avoiding jerk and stress on drive components. Fans or other systems  with belt drives can be started slowly to avoid belt slipping. Soft starts are seen in electrical R/C helicopters, and allow the rotor blades to spool-up in a smooth, controlled manner rather than a sudden surge. In all systems, a soft start limits the inrush current and so improves stability of the power supply and reduces transient voltage drops that may affect other loads.

An '''optical solar reflector''' ('''OSR''') consists of a top layer made out of [[quartz]], over a [[Reflection (optics)|reflecting]] layer made of [[metal]].

OSRs are used for [[radiators]] on [[spacecraft]]. The quartz outer layer lets the [[Sun|solar]] light through which reflects on the metal layer. This results in a low [[absorption coefficient]]. The quartz layer is a good [[Infrared|IR]] emitter.  The result of these properties is a good emitting, low absorbing material, thus making it a [[cold material]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wertz|first1=James R.|last2=Larson|first2=Wiley J.|title=Space Mission Analysis and Design|date=1991|publisher=Kluwer Academic|location=Dordrecht|isbn=0-7923-0970-7|pages=380–381|edition=2. print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optical solar reflectors are a type of [[First surface mirror|second surface mirror]].

[[File:Cm-alpha-curve-Cessna-182.svg|thumb|A graph showing coefficient of pitching moment with respect to [[angle of attack]]. The negative slope for positive &amp;alpha; indicates stability in pitching.]]
In [[aerodynamics]], the '''pitching moment''' on an [[airfoil]] is the [[Moment (physics)|moment]] (or [[torque]]) produced by the [[aerodynamic force]] on the airfoil if that aerodynamic force is considered to be applied, not at the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]], but at the [[aerodynamic center]] of the airfoil.  The pitching moment on the wing of an airplane is part of the total moment that must be balanced using the lift on the [[horizontal stabilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.3&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, a pitching moment is any moment acting on the [[pitch (aviation)|pitch]] axis of a moving body.

The [[Lift (force)|lift]] on an airfoil is a distributed force that can be said to act at a point called the center of pressure.  However, as [[angle of attack]] changes on a [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] airfoil, there is [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)#Movement of center of pressure|movement of the center of pressure]] forward and aft.  This makes analysis difficult when attempting to use the concept of the center of pressure.  One of the remarkable properties of a [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] airfoil is that, even though the center of pressure moves forward and aft, if the lift is imagined to act at a point called the [[aerodynamic center]] the moment of the lift force changes in proportion to the square of the airspeed.  If the moment is divided by the [[dynamic pressure]], the area and [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] of the airfoil, the result is known as the pitching moment coefficient. This coefficient changes only a little over the operating range of angle of attack of the airfoil.  The combination of the two concepts of ''aerodynamic center'' and ''pitching moment coefficient'' make it relatively simple to analyse some of the flight characteristics of an aircraft.&lt;ref name="LJC5.10"&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
The [[aerodynamic center]] of an airfoil is usually close to 25% of the chord behind the leading edge of the airfoil.  When making tests on a model airfoil, such as in a wind-tunnel, if the force sensor is not aligned with the quarter-chord of the airfoil, but offset by a distance '''x''', the pitching moment about the quarter-chord point, &lt;math&gt;M_{c/4}&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;M_{c/4} = M_\text{indicated} + \mathbf{x}\times (D_\text{indicated}, L_\text{indicated})&lt;/math&gt;
where the indicated values of ''D'' and ''L'' are the drag and lift on the model, as measured by the force sensor.

==Coefficient==
The '''pitching moment coefficient''' is important in the study of the [[longitudinal static stability]] of aircraft and missiles.

The ''pitching moment coefficient'' &lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.4&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;C_m=\frac{M}{qSc}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''M'' is the pitching moment, ''q'' is the [[dynamic pressure]], ''S'' is the [[planform (aeronautics)|wing area]], and ''c'' is the length of the [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] of the airfoil.
&lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless coefficient so consistent units must be used for ''M'', ''q'', ''S'' and ''c''.

'''Pitching moment coefficient''' is fundamental to the definition of [[aerodynamic center]] of an airfoil.  The ''aerodynamic center'' is defined to be the point on the chord line of the airfoil at which the ''pitching moment coefficient'' does not vary with angle of attack,&lt;ref name="LJC5.10"/&gt; or at least does not vary significantly over the operating range of angle of attack of the airfoil.

In the case of a symmetric airfoil, the lift force acts through one point for all angles of attack, and the ''center of pressure'' does not move as it does in a [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] airfoil.  Consequently, the ''pitching moment coefficient'' for a symmetric airfoil is zero.

The pitching moment is, by convention, considered to be positive when it acts to pitch the airfoil in the nose-up direction.  Conventional cambered airfoils supported at the aerodynamic center pitch nose-down so the ''pitching moment coefficient'' of these airfoils is negative.&lt;ref&gt;Ira H. Abbott, and Albert E. Von Doenhoff (1959), ''Theory of Wing Sections'', Dover Publications Inc., New York SBN 486-60586-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electronics]] and [[electrical engineering]], a '''ramp generator''' is a circuit that creates a linear rising or falling output with respect to time. The output variable is usually voltage, although current ramps can be created.
Linear ramp generators are also known as sweep generators

Ramp generator produces a Sawtooth wave form, Suppose a 3V is applied to input of a comparator of X terminal and ramp generator at Y terminal. the ramp generator starts increasing its voltage but, still lower than input X terminal of the comparator the output shall be 1, As soon as the ramp voltage is equal to or more than X, comparator output goes low.
   
==Applications==
Voltage and current linear ramp generator find wide application in instrumentation and communication systems. 
Ramp generators used in [[electrical generator]]s or [[electric motor]]s to avoid transients when changing a load.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2373">The '''Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate''' ([[german language|ger.:]] Rheinisch-Westfälisches Kohlen-Syndikat -RWKS) was a cartel established in 1893 in [[Essen]] bringing together the major coal producers in the [[Ruhr]].&lt;ref name="port traffic"&gt;{{cite journal|editor1=Reginald Loyen|editor2=Paul van de Laar|title=Port traffic in Rotterdam: the competitive edge of a Rhine-port (1880–1914)|journal=Struggling for leadership : Antwerp-Rotterdam port competition 1870-2000 ; [proceedings of the International Conference on Comparative Antwerp-Rotterdam Port History, held at Antwerp, 10-11 May, 2001]|date=2003|publisher=Physica-Verl.|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3790815245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The syndicate was set up as coal producers moved towards using shipping rather than railways to deliver their coal to [[Rotterdam]]. The cartel co-operated with the [[Dutch Coal Trade Union]], to whom they gave the sole distribution rights for [[Westphalia]]n coal. [[Daniël George van Beuningen]] of the [[SHV Holdings|Steenkolen Handels Vereniging]] was a leading figure in this relationship, greatly increasing the amount of coal imported to Rotterdam and resulting in the cost of using Rhine based barges dropping as their greater use also stimulated technical innovation.

This arrangement led to Rotterdam becoming not just the leading coal transhipment port in the [[Netherlands]] but also evolving into the major [[Bunkering|bunker port]] in Europe. In 1913 this coal transhipment accounted for over two thirds of the total shipping on the Rhine.&lt;ref name="port traffic"/&gt; By this time the Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate accounted for 93% of the coal output in the Ruhr and 54% of Germany as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogdanov|first1=Alexander|title=A Short Course of Economic Science|date=1923|publisher=Communist Party of Great Britain|location=London|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO) experiment has ended, but the facilities have been expanded into a permanent underground laboratory.[[File:SNOLAB_2014-03-21.jpg|thumb|right|SNOLAB surface building.  It is connected to the underground laboratory by [[narrow-gauge railway]].]]

Although accessed through a mine, the laboratory proper is maintained as a class-2000 [[cleanroom]], with very low levels of [[dust]] and [[background radiation]].

SNOLAB is the world's second-deepest underground lab facility; its {{Convert|6800|ft|m|-1}} [[overburden]] of rock provides 6010 [[meter water equivalent|metre water equivalent]] (MWE) shielding from [[cosmic ray]]s, providing a low-background environment for experiments requiring high [[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivities]] and extremely low counting {{nobr|rates.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{Citation |title= SNOLAB User's Handbook Rev. 2 |page=13 |url=http://snolab2008.snolab.ca/snolab_users_handbook_rev02.pdf |date=2006-06-26 |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory was the world's deepest underground experiment since the [[Particle experiments at Kolar Gold Fields|Kolar Gold Fields experiments]] ended with the closing of that mine in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Status of India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO)|first=Naba K. |last=Mondal |journal=Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy |volume=70 |issue=1 |date=January 2004 |pages=71–77 |url=http://www.imsc.res.in/~ino/OpenReports/Insa/naba.pdf |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the deepest underground laboratory in North America at 2100&amp;nbsp;[[metre water equivalent]] depth, and the deepest in the world at 4800&amp;nbsp;m.w.e., many other groups were interested in conducting experiments in the 6000&amp;nbsp;m.w.e. location.

In 2002, funding was approved by the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] to expand the SNO facilities into a general-purpose laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Canada selects 9 projects to lead in international research |url=http://www.innovation.ca/en/AboutUs/News/Canadaselects9projectsleadininternationalresearch |publisher=Canada Foundation for Innovation |date=2002-06-20 |accessdate=2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more funding was received in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Province Supports Expansion of World's Deepest Lab Administered by Carleton University |url=http://newsroom.carleton.ca/2007/08/21/province-supports-expansion-of-worlds-deepest-lab-administered-by-carleton-university/ |publisher=[[Carleton University]] |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New Funding will Support Underground Lab Operations as SNOLAB nears Completion |url= https://www.snolab.ca/sites/default/files/SnolabNewsRelease-2008-01-22.pdf |publisher=SNOLAB |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the major laboratory space was completed in 2009,&lt;ref name=status2009&gt;{{Cite web |title=SNOLAB Facility Status |url=http://snolab2009.snolab.ca/snolab-workshop-09/Fraser-facility-status.pdf |first=Fraser |last=Duncan |date=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the entire lab entering operation as a 'clean' space in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snolab.ca/public/updates/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110706203932/http://www.snolab.ca/public/updates/index.html |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SNOLAB was briefly the world's deepest underground laboratory, until it was surpassed by the 2.4&amp;nbsp;km-deep [[China Jinping Underground Laboratory]] at the end of 2010.  CJPL achieves a muon flux of less than 0.2 μ/m²/day,&lt;ref name=JinPing&gt;{{Citation |title=Measurement of Cosmic Ray Flux in China JinPing underground Laboratory |journal=Chinese Physics C |volume=37 |number=8 |date=August 2013 |author1=WU Yu-Cheng |author2=HAO Xi-Qing |author3=YUE Qian |author4=LI Yuan-Jing |author5=CHENG Jian-Ping |author6=KANG Ke-Jun |author7=CHEN Yun-Hua |author8=LI Jin |author9=LI Jian-Min |author10=LI Yu-Lan |author11=LIU Shu-Kui |author12=MA Hao |author13=REN Jin-Bao |author14=SHEN Man-Bin |author15=WANG Ji-Min |author16=WU Shi-Yong |author17=XUE Tao |author18=YI Nan |author19=ZENG Xiong-Hui |author20=ZENG Zhi |author21=ZHU Zhong-Hua |doi=10.1088/1674-1137/37/8/086001 |arxiv=1305.0899 |bibcode = 2013ChPhC..37h6001W }}&lt;/ref&gt; slightly less than SNOLAB's 0.27 μ/m²/day.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; (For comparison, the rate on the surface, at sea level, is about 15 million μ/m²/day.)

The planned [[DUSEL]] laboratory in the United States, which would have been deeper, was greatly scaled back after the [[National Science Foundation]] refused major funding in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.bhpioneer.com/local_news/article_5c46ec6e-af25-11e0-aeb5-001cc4c03286.html |title=DUSEL no more |first=Wendy |last=Pitlick |journal=Black Hills Pioneer |date=2011-07-15 |accessdate=2012-11-26 |quote=Lesko said the scaled back plans boil down to just one underground research campus. Originally, lab officials planned to build a major surface campus, a science campus 4,850 feet underground that included two lab modules, and a smaller lab module campus 7,400 feet underground. The Sanford Underground Research Facility, Lesko said, focuses on building just one campus at the 4,850-foot level that will host experiments in dark matter, double beta decay, and long baseline neutrino research.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aramco World''''' (formerly ''Saudi Aramco World'') is a bi-monthly magazine published by [[Aramco Services Company]], a US-based subsidiary of [[Saudi Aramco]], the state-owned oil company of the Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The first issue of the magazine appeared in November 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=William Tracy|title=Aramco World Turns 50|url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/199906/aramco.world.turns.50.htm|accessdate=28 September 2015|work=Aramco World|issue=50 (6)|date=December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bimonthly magazine is published in [[Houston, Texas]].

While Saudi Arabia is still frequently the main feature of articles, the magazine also covers the wider Arabic and Muslim world, and is aimed at both company employees and other interested readers. The website also allows free access to back issues going back to the early 1960s, including photography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intute.ac.uk/artsandhumanities/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=humbul16167 Saudi Aramco World] (from [[Intute]], Retrieved 12 May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the magazine's website was awarded "Best Magazine Website" by the [[Web Marketing Association]].

'''Seed paper''' is a type of handmade [[paper]] that includes any number of different plant [[seed]]s. The seeds themselves can still germinate after the papermaking process and they can sprout when the paper is planted in [[soil]].

[[Papermaking|Papermakers]] have been producing paper including seeds in the United States since 1941, but international papermakers have practiced seed inclusion in the paper for centuries.{{when|date=April 2012}} Seed paper has traditionally been handmade in smaller batches and is often made-to-order for clients.

Sprouting seed paper has enjoyed a resurgence of popularity in the United States recently.{{When|date=July 2011}} Seed paper can be used for [[stationery]], cards, invitations, and for decorative wraps.

A wide variety of flower, vegetable, and tree seeds can also be used in seed paper for decorative effect. The seeds and flowers in the paper can create decorative effects and colors. Depending on the type of seed and the process used, different colors, thickness, and patterns can be created.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1274">'''Skojec''' was a medieval central European unit of account as well as a unit of mass. It was also used as a unit of currency. 1 skojec was equal to 1/24 of a [[Grzywna (unit)|grzywna]].

1 skojec = 30 [[pfennig]]s&lt;br&gt;
1 [[wiardunek]] = 6 skojecs&lt;br&gt;
1 skojec = 2 [[groschen]]

The etymology of the word skojec derives from the word ''skot'' which in old Polish described [[cattle]]; cattle were used as the reference unit of exchange since at least the time of [[ancient Greece]], as there are references in the [[Iliad]] to a suit of [[armor]] costing 9 oxen. Athenian lawgiver [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]], when establishing his laws in 621 BCE, defined all the [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s in terms of how many cattle must be paid. The [[Latin]] word for [[money]], ''pecunia'', is proof that Romans always saw cattle (''pecus'') as the source of wealth. In time, a slab of [[copper]] with an imprint of an ox became equivalent to the worth of the animal. In India, the word ''rupia'' means both cattle and money. Similarly, in Poland ''skot'' meant cattle and its extension ''skojec'' described money.&lt;ref&gt;H.Cywiński, ''Z dziejów pieniądza na świecie'', Krajowa Agencja Wydawnicza, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snake Wells''' is a term used by [[Shell Oil]] to refer to a series of [[oil well]]s drilled in the Champion West oil field [[offshore drilling|offshore]] [[Brunei]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epmag.com/archives/features/653.htm] Smart Wells article in World Oil&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offshore-mag.com/display_article/253481/120/ARTCL/none/none/1/Smart-snake-well-achieves-record-flow-for-BSP-off-Brunei/] Smart wells article in "Offshore" magazine."&lt;/ref&gt; The wells used a combination of technologies including [[extended reach drilling]], swellable wellbore packers and remotely operated zonal isolation and control. The [[directional drilling]] technique allows the path of the well to be directed to achieve contact with as many potentially producing features as possible. This results in a "snake like" well path which weaves up and down through multiple geological features in order to achieve maximum reservoir drainage.

Shells marketing suggests that this approach is an invention of Shell, however in reality the technologies involved have all been used before elsewhere.

Shell's marketing states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The creative minds at Shell refused to accept that so much perfectly good oil was going to waste - so they decided to do something about it. The snake well drill is a ground breaking piece of technology that allows us to extract oil from these previously hard to reach places. Unlike conventional drills, state of the art software  allows the snake well drill to follow complex horizontal paths, cutting through shale and sand to reach a number of different reservoir pockets from a single drilling platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://realenergy.shell.com/?page=SnakeWellDrillWhatIsIt&amp;lang=en#SnakeWellDrillWhatIsIt] Snake Well Marketing from Shell&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite the high complexity of the wells, the articles published in the industry publications refer only to existing technologies.

{{Sustainable energy}}

A '''solar thermal collector''' collects [[heat]] by [[Absorption (optics)|absorbing]] [[sunlight]]. The term "solar collector" commonly refers to [[solar hot water panel]]s, but may refer to installations such as [[solar parabolic trough]]s and [[Solar power tower|solar towers]]; or basic installations such as [[solar air heat]]ers. [[Concentrated solar power]] plants usually use the more complex collectors to generate [[electricity]] by heating a fluid to drive a [[turbine]] connected to an [[electrical generator]].&lt;ref name="Norton 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Brian|title=Harnessing Solar Heat|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-7275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple collectors are typically used in residential and commercial buildings for space heating. The first solar thermal collector designed for building roofs was patented by William H. Goettl and called the "[[Solar heat collector and radiator for building roof]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/patents/US4098260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar-thermal collectors heating liquid==

Solar collectors are either non-concentrating or concentrating. In the non-concentrating type, the collector area (i.e., the area that intercepts the solar radiation) is the same as the absorber area (i.e., the area absorbing the radiation). In these types the whole solar panel absorbs light. Concentrating collectors have a bigger interceptor than absorber.&lt;ref name="Norton 2013"/&gt;

Flat-plate and evacuated-tube solar collectors are used to collect heat for space heating, domestic hot water or cooling with an absorption chiller.

===Flat plate collectors===
[[Image:Solar panels, Santorini2.jpg|thumb|right|Flat plate thermal system for water heating deployed on a flat roof]]
Flat-plate collectors are the most common solar thermal technology. They consist of an (1) enclosure containing (2) a dark colored absorber plate with fluid circulation passageways, and (3) a transparent cover to allow transmission of solar energy into the enclosure. The sides and back of the enclosure are typically insulated to reduce heat loss to the outside air. A fluid is circulated through the absorber's fluid passageways to remove heat from the solar collector. The circulation fluid in tropical and sub-tropical climates is typically water. In climates where freezing is likely, a heat-transfer fluid similar to an automotive [[antifreeze]] solution may be used instead of water, or in a mixture with water. If a heat transfer fluid is used, a [[heat exchanger]] is typically employed to transfer heat from the solar collector fluid to a hot water storage tank. The most common absorber design consists of copper tubing attached to thermally conductive copper or aluminum fins. A dark coating is applied to the sun-facing side of the absorber assembly to increase it absorption of solar energy. A common absorber coating is flat black enamel paint. 

In higher performance solar collector designs, the transparent cover is tempered glass with reduced iron oxide content (the green color visible when viewing a pane of window glass from the side). The glass may also have a [[stippling]] pattern an anti-reflective coating to trap more solar energy by reducing reflection. The absorber coating is typically a selective coating. Selective coatings have special optical properties to improve efficiency by reducing the emittance of infrared energy from the absorber.

Some manufacturers have introduced inexpensive flat plate solar collectors that employ [[polycarbonate]] transparent covers and [[polypropylene]] absorber assemblies.  

Most air heat fabricators and some water heat manufacturers have a completely flooded absorber consisting of two sheets of metal which the fluid passes between. Because the heat exchange area is greater, they may be marginally more efficient than traditional absorbers.&lt;ref name="Domestic Solar Hot Water Systems"&gt;{{cite web|title=Domestic Hot Water Systems|author=rise.org.au|url=http://www.rise.org.au/info/Tech/lowtemp/hotwatersys.html|accessdate=2008-10-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309140814/http://www.rise.org.au/info/Tech/lowtemp/hotwatersys.html|archivedate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In locations with average available solar energy, flat plate collectors are sized approximately one-half to one square foot per gallon of one day's hot water use. Absorber piping configurations include:
* harp{{spaced ndash}}traditional design with bottom pipe risers and top collection pipe, used in low pressure thermosyphon and pumped systems;
* serpentine{{spaced ndash}}one continuous S that maximizes temperature but not total energy yield in variable flow systems, used in compact solar domestic hot water only systems (no space heating role);
* flooded absorber consisting of two sheets of metal stamped to produce a circulation zone;
* boundary layer absorber collectors consisting of several layers of transparent and opaque sheets that enable absorption in a boundary layer. Because the energy is absorbed in the boundary layer, heat conversion may be more efficient than for collectors where absorbed heat is conducted through a material before the heat is accumulated in a circulating liquid.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
Polymer flat plate collectors are an alternative to metal collectors and are now being produced in Europe. These may be wholly [[polymer]], or they may include metal plates in front of freeze-tolerant water channels made of [[silicone rubber]]. Polymers are flexible and therefore freeze-tolerant and can employ plain water instead of antifreeze, so that they may be plumbed directly into existing water tanks instead of needing [[heat exchangers]] that lower efficiency. By dispensing with a heat exchanger, temperatures need not be quite so high for the circulation system to be switched on, so such direct circulation panels, whether polymer or otherwise, can be more efficient, particularly at low light levels. Some early selectively coated polymer collectors suffered from overheating when insulated, as stagnation temperatures can exceed the polymer's melting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=17036823 |title=Polymeric absorbers for flat-plate collectors : Can venting provide adequate overheat protection? |publisher=Cat.inist.fr |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t632m867672l8w46/ |title=Solar Thermal Collectors in Polymeric Materials: A Novel Approach Towards Higher Operating Temperatures |accessdate=2013-08-20 | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-75997-3_118 |journal=Proceedings of ISES World Congress 2007 (Vol. I – Vol. V) |pages=640–643}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the melting point of [[polypropylene]] is {{convert|160|C}}, while the stagnation temperature of insulated thermal collectors can exceed {{convert|180|C}} if control strategies are not used. For this reason polypropylene is not often used in glazed selectively coated solar collectors. Increasingly polymers such as high temperate silicones (which melt at over {{convert|250|C}}) are being used. Some non polypropylene polymer based glazed solar collectors are matte black coated rather than selectively coated to reduce the stagnation temperature to {{convert|150|C}} or less.

In areas where freezing is a possibility, freeze-tolerance (the capability to freeze repeatedly without cracking) can be achieved by the use of flexible polymers. Silicone rubber pipes have been used for this purpose in UK since 1999. Conventional metal collectors are vulnerable to damage from freezing, so if they are water filled they must be carefully plumbed so they completely drain using gravity before freezing is expected, so that they do not crack. Many metal collectors are installed as part of a sealed heat exchanger system. Rather than having potable water flow directly through the collectors, a mixture of water and antifreeze such as propylene glycol is used. A heat exchange fluid protects against freeze damage down to a locally determined risk temperature that depends on the proportion of propylene glycol in the mixture. The use of glycol lowers the water's heat carrying capacity  marginally, while the addition of an extra heat exchanger may lower system performance at low light levels.

A pool or unglazed collector is a simple form of flat-plate collector without a transparent cover. Typically polypropylene or EPDM rubber or silicone rubber is used as an absorber. Used for pool heating it can work quite well when the desired output temperature is near the ambient temperature (that is, when it is warm outside). As the ambient temperature gets cooler, these collectors become less effective. Most flat plate collectors have a life expectancy of over 25 years.

===Evacuated tube collectors===
[[Image:Vakuumroehrenkollektor 01.jpg|thumb|right|Evacuated tube collector]]
[[Image:Solar vacuum tube collectors Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|An array of evacuated tubes collectors on a roof]]
Most vacuum tube collectors are used in middle Europe use heat pipes for their core instead of passing liquid directly through them. Direct flow is more popular in China.  Evacuated heat pipe tubes (EHPTs) are composed of multiple [[Vacuum|evacuated]] [[glass]] tubes each containing an absorber plate fused to a [[heat pipe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thermomax.com/Downloads/Vacuum%20Tube%20Paper.pdf |title=Vacuum Tube Liquid-Vapor (Heat-Pipe) Collectors |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heat is transferred to the transfer fluid (water or an [[antifreeze]] mix—typically [[propylene glycol]]) of a domestic hot water or [[hydronic]] space heating system in a heat exchanger called a "manifold". The manifold is wrapped in insulation and covered by a protective sheet metal or plastic case.
The vacuum inside of the evacuated tube collectors have been proven to last more than 25 years, the reflective coating for the design is encapsulated in the vacuum inside of the tube, which will not degrade until the vacuum is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucsolar.org/files/public/documents/Poster-1.pdf |title=Solar Evacuated Tube Collectors |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The vacuum that surrounds the outside of the tube greatly reduces [[convection]] and [[conduction (heat)|conduction]] heat loss, therefore achieving greater efficiency than flat-plate collectors, especially in colder conditions. This advantage is largely lost in warmer climates, except in those cases where very hot water is desirable, e.g., for commercial processes. The high temperatures that can occur may require special design to prevent overheating.
[[Image:Evacuated tube diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Glass-glass evacuated tube]]
Some evacuated tubes (glass-metal) are made with one layer of glass that fuses to the heat pipe at the upper end and encloses the heat pipe and absorber in the vacuum. Others (glass-glass) are made with a double layer of glass fused together at one or both ends with a vacuum between the layers (like a [[vacuum bottle]] or flask), with the absorber and heat pipe contained at normal atmospheric pressure. Glass-glass tubes have a highly reliable vacuum seal, but the two layers of glass reduce the light that reaches the absorber. Moisture may enter the non-evacuated area of the tube and cause absorber corrosion. Glass-metal tubes allow more light to reach the absorber, and protect the absorber and heat pipe from corrosion even if they are made from dissimilar materials (see [[galvanic corrosion]]).

The gaps between the tubes may allow for snow to fall through the collector, minimizing the loss of production in some snowy conditions, though the lack of radiated heat from the tubes can also prevent effective shedding of accumulated snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eventhorizonsolar.com/pdf/FlatvsEvac.pdf |title=Solar Flat Plate vs. Evacuated Tube Collectors |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

===Comparisons of flat plate and evacuated tube collectors===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
A longstanding argument exists between proponents of these two technologies. Some of this can be related to the physical structure of evacuated tube collectors which have a discontinuous absorbance area. An array of evacuated tubes on a roof has open space between the collector tubes, and vacuum between the two concentric glass tubes of each collector. Collector tubes cover only a fraction of a unit area on a roof. If evacuated tubes are compared with flat-plate collectors on the basis of area of roof occupied, a different conclusion might be reached than if the areas of absorber were compared. In addition, the ISO 9806 standard&lt;ref&gt;ISO 9806-2:1995. Test methods for solar collectors -- Part 2: Qualification test procedures. [[International Organization for Standardization]], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; is ambiguous in describing the way in which the efficiency of solar thermal collectors should be measured, since these could be measured either in terms of gross area or in terms of absorber area. Unfortunately, power output is not given for thermal collectors as it is for [[solar panel|PV panels]]. This makes it difficult for purchasers and engineers to make informed decisions.

Flat-plate collectors usually lose more heat to the environment than evacuated tubes, as an increasing function of temperature. They are inappropriate for high temperature applications such as process steam production. Evacuated tube collectors have a lower absorber plate area to gross area ratio (typically 60–80% of gross area) compared to flat plates. Based on absorber plate area, most evacuated tube systems are more efficient per square meter than equivalent flat plate systems. This makes them suitable where roof space is limiting, for example where the number of occupants of a building is higher than the number of square metres of suitable and available roof space. In general, per installed square metre, evacuated tubes deliver marginally more energy when the ambient temperature is low (e.g. during winter) or when the sky is overcast. However, even in areas without much sunshine and solar heat, some low cost flat plate collectors can be more cost efficient than evacuated tube collectors. Although several European companies manufacture evacuated tube collectors, the evacuated tube market is dominated by manufacturers in the East. Several Chinese companies have track records of 15–30 years. There is no unambiguous evidence that the two designs differ in long term reliability. However, evacuated tube technology is younger and (especially for newer variants with sealed heat pipes) still need to demonstrate competitive lifetimes. The modularity of evacuated tubes can be advantageous in terms of extensibility and maintenance, for example if the vacuum in one tube diminishes.

[[File:Comparison 1000.png|thumb|right|Chart showing flat-plate collectors outperforming evacuated tubes up until 120°F above ambient and, shaded in gray, the normal operating range for solar domestic hot water systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Solar Hot Water Systems: Lessons Learned, 1977 to Today | author=Tom Lane | page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For a given absorber area, evacuated tubes can therefore maintain their efficiency over a wide range of ambient temperatures and heating requirements. In most climates, flat-plate collectors will generally be more cost-effective than evacuated tubes. When employed in arrays and considered instead on a per square metre basis, the efficient but costly evacuated tube collectors can have a net benefit in winter and summer. They are well-suited to cold ambient temperatures and work well in situations of consistently low sunshine, providing heat more consistently than flat plate collectors per square metre. Heating of water by a medium to low amount (i.e. Tm-Ta) is much more efficiently performed by flat plate collectors. Domestic hot water frequently falls into this medium category. Glazed or unglazed flat collectors are the preferred devices for heating swimming pool water.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ateliving.com/pdf/Vacuum-Tube-Collector-andFlat-Plat-Collector-comparation.pdf Flatplate vs. EHTP]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203122744/http://www.ateliving.com/pdf/Vacuum-Tube-Collector-andFlat-Plat-Collector-comparation.pdf |date=December 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unglazed collectors may be suitable in tropical or subtropical environments if domestic hot water needs to be heated by less than 20&amp;nbsp;°C. A contour map can show which type is more effective (both thermal efficiency and energy/cost) for any geographic region.

EHPTs work as a thermal one-way valve due to their heat pipes. This gives them an inherent maximum [[operating temperature]] that acts as a safety feature. They have less aerodynamic drag, which may allow them to be placed onto the roof without being tied down. They can collect thermal radiation from the bottom in addition to the top. Tubes can be replaced individually without stopping the entire system. There is no condensation or corrosion within the tubes. One hurdle to wider adoption of evacuated tube collectors in some markets is their inability to pass internal thermal shock tests where ISO 9806-2 section 9 class b is a requirement for durability certification.&lt;ref&gt;[[FSEC]] test standard 102-10 section 5.6. [http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/pdf/standards/FSECstd_102-10.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that if unprotected evacuated tube collectors are exposed to full sun for too long prior to being filled with cold water the tubes may shatter due to the rapid temperature shift. There is also the question of vacuum leakage. Flat panels have been around much longer and are less expensive. They may be easier to clean. Other properties, such as appearance and ease of installation are more subjective.

====Applications====
The main use of this technology is in residential buildings where the demand for hot water has a large impact on energy bills. This generally means a situation with a large family, or a situation in which the hot water demand is excessive due to frequent laundry washing. Commercial applications include laundromats, car washes, military laundry facilities and eating establishments. The technology can also be used for space heating if the building is located off-grid or if utility power is subject to frequent outages. [[Solar water heating]] systems are most likely to be cost effective for facilities with water heating systems that are expensive to operate, or with operations such as laundries or kitchens that require large quantities of hot water. Unglazed liquid collectors  are commonly used to heat water for swimming pools but can also be applied to large scale water pre-heating. When loads are large relative to available collector area the bulk of the water heating can be done at low temperature, lower than swimming pool temperatures where unglazed collectors are well established in the marketplace as the right choice. Because these collectors need not withstand high temperatures, they can use less expensive materials such as plastic or rubber. Many unglazed collectors are made of polypropylene and must be drained fully to avoid freeze damage when air temperatures drop below 44F on clear nights.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Lane, Solar Hot Water Systems, Lessons Learned 1977 to Today p7&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller but growing percentage of unglazed collectors are flexible meaning they can withstand water freezing solid inside their absorber. The freeze concern only need be the water filled piping and collector manifolds in a hard freeze condition. Unglazed solar hot water systems should be installed to "drainback" to a storage tank whenever solar radiation is insufficient. There are no thermal shock concerns with unglazed systems. Commonly used in swimming pool heating since solar energy's early beginnings, unglazed solar collectors heat swimming pool water directly without the need for antifreeze or heat exchangers. Hot water solar systems require heat exchangers due to contamination possibilities and in the case of unglazed collectors, the  pressure difference between the solar working fluid (water) and the load (pressurized cold city water). Large scale unglazed solar hot water heaters like the one at the Minoru Aquatic Center in Richmond BC&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h2otsun.com/hotwater/minflyer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  operate at lower temperatures than evacuated tube or boxed and glazed collector systems so they require larger more expensive heat exchangers but all other components including vented storage tanks and uninsulated plastic PVC piping reduce costs of this alternative dramatically compared to the higher temperature collector types. When heating hot water, we are actually heating cold to warm and warm to hot. We can heat cold to warm as efficiently with unglazed collectors, just as we can heat warm to hot with high temperature collectors

===Bowl===
A ''solar bowl'' is a type of solar thermal collector that operates similarly to a [[#Parabolic dish|parabolic dish]], but instead of using a tracking parabolic mirror with a fixed receiver, it has a fixed spherical mirror with a tracking receiver. This reduces efficiency, but makes it cheaper to build and operate. Designers call it a ''fixed mirror distributed focus solar power system''. The main reason for its development was to eliminate the cost of moving a large mirror to track the sun as with parabolic dish systems.&lt;ref name=solarbowl&gt;Calhoun, Fryor "[https://books.google.com/books?id=giwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;ots=pzBO_Yy500&amp;dq=crosbyton%20solar%20bowl&amp;pg=PA199#v=onepage&amp;q=crosbyton%20solar%20bowl&amp;f=false Duel for the Sun]" [[Texas Monthly]] November 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

A fixed parabolic mirror creates a variously shaped image of the sun as it moves across the sky. Only when the mirror is pointed directly at the sun does the light focus on one point. That is why parabolic dish systems track the sun. A fixed [[Curved mirror|spherical mirror]] focuses the light in the same place independent of the sun's position. The light, however, is not directed to one point but is distributed on a line from the surface of the mirror to one half radius (along a line that runs through the sphere center and the sun).

[[File:Sphericalmirrorimage.jpg|thumb|Typical energy density along the 1/2 radius length focal line of a spherical reflector]]

As the sun moves across the sky, the aperture of any fixed collector changes. This causes changes in the amount of captured sunlight, producing what is called the ''sinus effect'' of power output. Proponents of the solar bowl design claim the reduction in overall power output compared with tracking parabolic mirrors is offset by lower system costs.&lt;ref name=solarbowl/&gt;

The sunlight concentrated at the focal line of a spherical reflector is collected using a tracking receiver. This receiver is pivoted around the focal line and is usually counterbalanced. The receiver may consist of pipes carrying fluid for thermal transfer or [[Solar cell|photovoltaic cells]] for direct conversion of light to electricity.

The solar bowl design resulted from a project of the Electrical Engineering Department of the Texas Technical University, headed by Edwin O'Hair, to develop a 5 MWe power plant. A solar bowl was built for the town of [[Crosbyton, Texas]] as a pilot facility.&lt;ref name=solarbowl/&gt; The bowl had a diameter of {{convert|65|ft|m|abbr=on}}, tilted at a 15° angle to optimize the cost/yield relation (33° would have maximized yield). The rim of the hemisphere was "trimmed" to 60°, creating a maximum aperture of {{convert|3318|sqft|m2}}. This pilot bowl produced electricity at a rate of 10&amp;nbsp;kW peak.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

A 15-meter diameter Auroville solar bowl was developed from an earlier test of a 3.5-meter bowl in 1979–1982 by the [[Tata Energy Research Institute]]. That test showed the use of the solar bowl in the production of steam for cooking. The full-scale project to build a solar bowl and kitchen ran from 1996, and was fully operational by 2001.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Solar-thermal collectors heating air==

A simple solar air collector consists of an absorber material, sometimes having a selective surface, to capture radiation from the sun and transfers this thermal energy to air via conduction heat transfer. This heated air is then ducted to the building space or to the process area where the heated air is used for space heating or process heating needs. Functioning in a similar manner as a conventional forced air furnace, solar-thermal-air systems provide heat by circulating air over an energy collecting surface, absorbing the sun’s thermal energy, and ducting air coming in contact with it. Simple and effective collectors can be made for a variety of air conditioning and process applications.

A variety of applications can utilize solar air heat technologies to reduce the carbon footprint from use of conventional heat sources, such as fossil fuels, to create a sustainable means to produce thermal energy. Applications such as space heating, greenhouse season extension, pre-heating ventilation makeup air, or process heat can be addressed by solar air heat devices. In the field of ‘solar co-generation,' solar thermal technologies are paired with photovoltaics (PV) to increase the efficiency of the system by taking heat away from the PV collectors, cooling the PV panels to improve their electrical performance while simultaneously warming air for space heating.

==Space heating and ventilating==

Space heating for residential and commercial applications can be done through the use of solar air heating panels. This configuration operates by drawing air from the building envelope or from the outdoor environment and passing it through the collector where the air warms via conduction from the absorber and is then supplied to the living or working space by either passive means or with the assistance of a fan. A pioneering figure of this type of system was George Löf, who built a solar heated air system in 1945 for a house in Boulder, Colorado. He later included a gravel bed for heat storage.

Ventilation, fresh air or makeup air is required in most commercial, industrial and institutional buildings to meet code requirements. By drawing air through a properly designed unglazed transpired air collector or an air heater, the solar heated fresh air can reduce the heating load during daytime operation. Many applications are now being installed where the transpired collector preheats the fresh air entering a heat recovery ventilator to reduce the defrost time of HRV's. The higher your ventilation and temperature the better your payback time will be.

==Process heating==

Solar air heat is also used in process applications such as drying laundry, crops (i.e. tea, corn, coffee) and other drying applications. Air heated through a solar collector and then passed over a medium to be dried can provide an efficient means by which to reduce the moisture content of the material.

==Solar air heating collector types==

Collectors are commonly classified by their air-ducting methods as one of three types:
* through-pass collectors
* front-pass
* back pass
* combination front and back pass collectors

Collectors can also be classified by their outer surface:
* glazed
* unglazed

{{anchor |Through-pass}}
===Through-pass air collector===

Offering the highest efficiency of any solar technology the through-pass configuration, air ducted onto one side of the absorber passes through a perforated material and is heated from the conductive properties of the material and the convective properties of the moving air. Through-pass absorbers have the most surface area which enables relatively high conductive heat transfer rates, but significant pressure drop can require greater fan power, and deterioration of certain absorber material after many years of solar radiation exposure can additionally create problems with air quality and performance.

{{anchor |Back}}
====Back, front, and combination passage air collector====

In back-pass, front-pass, and combination type configurations the air is directed on either the back, the front, or on both sides of the absorber to be heated from the return to the supply ducting headers. Although passing the air on both sides of the absorber will provide a greater surface area for conductive heat transfer, issues with dust (fouling) can arise from passing air on the front side of the absorber which reduces absorber efficiency by limiting the amount of sunlight received. In cold climates, air passing next to the glazing will additionally cause greater heat loss, resulting in lower overall performance of the collector.

{{anchor |Glazed}}
====Glazed systems====
 
Glazed systems usually have a transparent top sheet and insulated side and back panels to minimize heat loss to ambient air. The absorber plates in modern panels can have [[Absorbance|absorptivity]] of more than 93%. Glazed Solar Collectors (recirculating types that are usually used for space heating). Air typically passes along the front or back of the absorber plate while scrubbing heat directly from it. Heated air can then be distributed directly for applications such as space heating and drying or may be stored for later use. Payback for glazed solar air heating panels can be less than 9–15 years depending on the fuel being replaced.

{{anchor |Unglazed}}
====Unglazed systems====

Unglazed systems, or transpired air systems have been used to heat make-up or ventilation air in commercial, industrial, agriculture and process applications. They consist of an absorber plate which air passes across or through as it scrubs heat from the absorber. Non-transparent glazing materials are less expensive, and decrease expected payback periods. Transpired collectors are considered "unglazed" because their collector surfaces are exposed to the elements, are often not transparent and not hermetically sealed.

===Unglazed transpired solar collectors===

{{anchor |Background}}
====Background====
The term "unglazed air collector" refers to a solar air heating system that consists of a metal absorber without any glass or glazing over top. The most common type of unglazed collector on the market is the transpired solar collector. The technology has been extensively monitored by these government agencies, and Natural Resources Canada developed the feasibility tool RETScreen™ to model the energy savings from transpired solar collectors. Since that time, several thousand transpired solar collector systems have been installed in a variety of commercial, industrial, institutional, agricultural, and process applications in countries around the world. This technology was originally used primarily in industrial applications such as manufacturing and assembly plants where there were high ventilation requirements, stratified ceiling heat, and often negative pressure in the building. With the increasing drive to install renewable energy systems on buildings, transpired solar collectors are now used across the entire building stock because of high energy production (up to 750 peak thermal Watts/square metre), high solar conversion (up to 90%) and lower capital costs when compared against solar photovoltaic and solar water heating.

[[Image:Transpired Air Collector.PNG|thumb|Solar air heating is a solar thermal technology in which the energy from the sun, solar insolation, is captured by an absorbing medium and used to heat air.]]  Solar air heating is a renewable energy heating technology used to heat or condition air for buildings or process heat applications. It is typically the most cost-effective of all the solar technologies, especially in large scale applications, and it addresses the largest usage of building energy in heating climates, which is space heating and industrial process heating. They are either glazed or unglazed.

{{anchor |Method}}
====Method of operation====

Unglazed air collectors heat ambient (outside) air instead of recirculated building air. Transpired solar collectors are usually wall-mounted to capture the lower sun angle in the winter heating months as well as sun reflection off the snow and achieve their optimum performance and return on investment when operating at flow rates of between 4 and 8 CFM per square foot (72 to 144 m3/h.m2) of collector area.

The exterior surface of a transpired solar collector consists of thousands of tiny micro-perforations that allow the boundary layer of heat to be captured and uniformly drawn into an air cavity behind the exterior panels. This heated ventilation air is drawn under negative pressure into the building’s ventilation system where it is then distributed via conventional means or using a solar ducting system.

Hot air that may enter an HVAC system connected to a transpired collector that has air outlets positioned along the top of the collector, particularly if the collector is west facing. To counter this problem, Matrix Energy has patented a transpired collector with a lower air outlet position and perforated cavity framing to perpetrate increased air turbulence behind the perforated absorber for increased performance.

This cutaway view shows the MatrixAir transpired solar collector components and air flow. The lower air inlet mitigates the intake of heated air to the HVAC system during summer operation.

The extensive monitoring by Natural Resources Canada and NREL has shown that transpired solar collector systems reduce between 10-50% of the conventional heating load and that RETScreen is an accurate predictor of system performance.
Transpired solar collectors act as a rainscreen and they also capture heat loss escaping from the building envelope which is collected in the collector air cavity and drawn back into the ventilation system. There is no maintenance required with solar air heating systems and the expected lifespan is over 30 years.

{{anchor |Variations}}
====Variations of transpired solar collectors====

Unglazed transpired collectors can also be roof-mounted for applications in which there is not a suitable south facing wall or for other architectural considerations. Matrix Energy Inc. has patented a roof mounted product called the “Delta” a modular, roof-mounted solar air heating system where southerly, east or west facing facades are simply not available.

Each ten foot (3.05 m) module will deliver 250 CFM (425 m3/h)of preheated fresh air typically providing annual energy savings of 1100 kWh (4 GJ) annually. This unique two stage, modular roof mounted transpired collector operating a nearly 90% efficiency each module delivering over 118 l/s of preheated air per two square meter collector. Up to seven collectors may be connected in series in one row, with no limit to the number of rows connected in parallel along one central duct typically yielding 4 CFM of preheated air per square foot of available roof area. +

Transpired collectors can be configured to heat the air twice to increase the delivered air temperature making it suitable for space heating applications as well as ventilation air heating. In a 2-stage system, the first stage is the typical unglazed transpired collector and the second stage has glazing covering the transpired collector. The glazing allows all of that heated air from the first stage to be directed through a second set of transpired collectors for a second stage of solar heating.

==Solar-thermal collectors generating electricity==

[[Parabolic trough]]s, dishes and towers described in this section are used almost exclusively in [[solar power generating station]]s or for research purposes. Parabolic troughs have been used for some commercial [[solar air conditioning]] systems. Although simple, these solar concentrators are quite far from the theoretical maximum concentration.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roland Winston et al., ''Nonimaging Optics'', Academic Press, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0127597515}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the parabolic trough concentration is about 1/3 of the theoretical maximum for the same [[Acceptance angle (solar concentrator)|acceptance angle]], that is, for the same overall tolerances for the system. Approaching the theoretical maximum may be achieved by using more elaborate concentrators based on [[nonimaging optics]].&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"/&gt; Solar thermal collectors may also be used in conjunction with photovoltaic collectors to obtain combined heat and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mojiri'' | first1 =  | year = 2013 | title = Spectral beam splitting for efficient conversion of solar energy — A review | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032113005662 | journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 654–663 | doi=10.1016/j.rser.2013.08.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = R.A. | year = 2012 | title = Nanofluid-based optical filter optimization for PV/T systems | url = | journal = Light: Science &amp; Applications | volume = 1 | issue = | page = e34 | doi = 10.1038/lsa.2012.34 | bibcode = 2012LSA.....1E..34T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Parabolic trough.svg|thumb|left|Parabolic trough]]

===Parabolic trough===
{{main article|Parabolic trough}}

This type of collector is generally used in [[solar power]] plants. A trough-shaped [[parabolic reflector]] is used to concentrate sunlight on an insulated tube ([[Dewar tube]]) or [[heat pipe]], placed at the [[Focus (optics)|focal point]], containing [[coolant]] which transfers heat from the collectors to the [[boilers]] in the power station.

===Parabolic dish===

[[Image:Parabolic-dish.jpg|right|thumb|Solar Parabolic dish]]

With a parabolic dish collector, one or more [[parabola|parabolic]] dishes concentrate solar energy at a single focal point, similar to the way a [[reflecting telescope]] focuses starlight, or a [[dish antenna]] focuses radio waves. This geometry may be used in [[solar furnace]]s and solar power plants.

The shape of a parabola means that incoming light rays which are parallel to the dish's axis will be reflected toward the focus, no matter where on the dish they arrive. Light from the sun arrives at the Earth's surface almost completely parallel, and the dish is aligned with its axis pointing at the sun, allowing almost all incoming radiation to be reflected towards the focal point of the dish. Most losses in such collectors are due to imperfections in the parabolic shape and imperfect reflection.

Losses due to atmospheric scattering are generally minimal. However, on a hazy or foggy day, light is diffused in all directions through the atmosphere, which significantly reduces the efficiency of a parabolic dish.

In [[Concentrated solar power#Dish Stirling|dish stirling]] power plant designs, a [[stirling engine]] coupled to a dynamo, is placed at the focus of the dish. This absorbs the energy focused onto it and converts it into electricity.

===Power tower===
{{Main article|Solar power tower}}

A power tower is a large tower surrounded by tracking mirrors called [[heliostat]]s. These mirrors align themselves and focus sunlight on the receiver at the top of tower, collected heat is transferred to a power station below. This design reaches very high temperatures. High temperatures are suitable for electricity generation using conventional methods like [[steam turbine]] or a direct high temperature chemical reaction such as liquid salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woody|first=Todd|title=Secret Ingredient To Making Solar Energy Work: Salt|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddwoody/2012/04/05/secret-ingredient-to-making-solar-energy-work-salt/|publisher=Forbes magazine|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By concentrating sunlight, current systems can get better efficiency than simple solar cells. A larger area can be covered by using relatively inexpensive mirrors rather than using expensive [[solar cell]]s. Concentrated light can be redirected to a suitable location via [[optical fiber cable]] for such uses as illuminating buildings. Heat storage for power production during cloudy and overnight conditions can be accomplished, often by underground tank storage of heated fluids. [[Molten salt]]s have been used to good effect. Other working fluids, such as liquid metals, have also been proposed due to their superior thermal properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boerema | first1 =  | year = 2012 | title = Liquid sodium versus Hitec as a heat transfer fluid in solar thermal central receiver systems | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X12001703 | journal = Solar Energy| volume = 86 | issue = 9| pages = 2293–2305 | doi=10.1016/j.solener.2012.05.001| bibcode = 2012SoEn...86.2293B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, concentrating systems require [[solar tracker|sun tracking]] to maintain sunlight focus at the collector. They are unable to provide significant power in [[diffuse reflection|diffused light]] conditions. Solar cells are able to provide some output even if the sky becomes cloudy, but power output from concentrating systems drops drastically in cloudy conditions as diffused light cannot be concentrated.

'''Tetranitratoborate''' is an anion composed of boron with four nitrate groups. It has formula [B(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. It can form salts with large cations such as tetramethyl ammonium nitratoborate,&lt;ref name="Guibert1966"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guibert|first=C. R.|author2=M. D. Marshall |year=1966|title=Synthesis of the Tetranitratoborate Anion|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=88|issue=1|pages=189–190|issn=0002-7863|doi=10.1021/ja00953a051}}&lt;/ref&gt; or tetraethyl ammonium  tetranitratoborate.&lt;ref name="Titova1970"/&gt;

The ion was first discovered by C. R. Guibert, M. D. Marshall in 1966 after failed attempts to make neutral (non-ionic) boron nitrate.&lt;ref name="Guibert1966"/&gt;

The related molecule, '''boron nitrate''' B(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, has resisted attempts to make it, and if it exists it is unstable above −78&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Titova1970"/&gt;

Other related ions are the slightly more stable [[tetraperchloratoborate]]s, with perchlorate groups instead of nitrate, and [[tetranitratoaluminate]]&lt;ref name="Jones2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=CJ Bigler|title=Transition and Main Group Metals Applied to Oxidative Functionalization of Methane and Use as High Oxygen Carriers for Rocket Propellants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELjafGhBa3EC&amp;pg=PA139|accessdate=3 February 2014|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9780549231066|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the next atom down the periodic table, aluminium instead of boron ([Al(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Formation ==
Tetramethyl ammonium chloride reacts with BCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to make (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NBCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then the tetrachloroborate is reacted with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at around −20&amp;nbsp;°C to form tetramethyl ammonium nitratoborate, and other gases such as NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Titova1970"/&gt;

Another mechanism to make tetranitratoborate salts is to shake a metal nitrate with BCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in chloroform at 20&amp;nbsp;°C for several days.  [[Chloronitratoborate]] [Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is an unstable intermediate.

Also prominent is 1,297 and 1,311&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; attributed to ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, with these vibrations due to the nitrate bonded via one oxygen.&lt;ref name="Guibert1966"/&gt;

The density of tetramethyl ammonium nitratoborate is 1.555.  It is colourless and crystalline. As tetramethyl ammonium nitratoborate is heated it has some sort of transition between 51 and 62&amp;nbsp;°C.  It decomposes above 75&amp;nbsp;°C producing gas.  Above 112&amp;nbsp;°C it is exothermic, and a solid is left if it is heated to 160&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Titova1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Titova|first=K. V.|author2=V. Ya.

Tetramethyl ammonium nitratoborate is insoluble in cold water but slightly soluble in hot water.  It does not react with water. It also dissolves in liquid ammonia, acetonitrile, methanol, and [[dimethylformamide]].&lt;ref name="Guibert1966"/&gt;  It reacts with liquid [[sulfur dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Guibert1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Addison"&gt;{{cite book|authors=C.C. Addison and D. Sutton|title=Progress in Inorganic Chemistry|volume=8|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At room temperature tetramethyl ammonium nitratoborate is stable for months.  It does not explode with impact.&lt;ref name="Guibert1966"/&gt;

Alkali metal tetranitratoborates are unstable at room temperature and decompose.&lt;ref name="Titova1975"/&gt;

1-Ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolimium tetranitratoborate was discovered in 2002.  It is an ionic liquid that turns solid at −25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Jones2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=C.

'''''The Formula''''' is a 1980 American [[mystery film]] directed by [[John G. Avildsen]] and released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It features a preeminent cast including [[Marlon Brando]], [[George C. Scott]], [[John Gielgud]], and [[Marthe Keller]]. [[Craig T. Nelson]] also makes a brief appearance as a geologist.

==Plot==
The film opens in the final days of [[World War II]] as Soviet forces [[Battle of Berlin|close in on the outskirts of Berlin]]. [[Panzer corps|Panzer Korps]] General Helmut Kladen ([[Richard Lynch (actor)|Richard Lynch]]) is dispatched to the [[Germany–Switzerland border|Swiss frontier]] with top secret documents to be used as a bargaining chip with the Allies to save Germany from the Soviets. He is subsequently intercepted by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and turned over to [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]].

In contemporary [[Los Angeles]], Lt. Barney Caine ([[George C. Scott]]) is assigned to solve the murder of his former boss and friend Tom Neeley, which presumably occurred during a drug deal gone wrong. However, Neeley has written "Gene" on a newspaper in his own blood, and Caine finds a map of Germany with the name "Obermann" on it. Caine is surprised to learn that Neeley provided drugs at parties hosted by the tycoon Adam Steiffel ([[Marlon Brando]]). When he interviews Neeley's ex-wife ([[Beatrice Straight]]), he quickly catches her in several lies, and when he returns to interview her a second time, he finds her shot dead in her hot tub.

Steiffel reveals in his interview that Neeley was working for him as a [[bagman]]. Neeley was sent overseas by the company to deliver money to business partners. Caine becomes convinced he must go to Germany to solve Neeley's murder, he convinces his Chief ([[Alan North]]) to allow him to go to Germany to continue the investigation. Later, the Chief is seen phoning one of Steiffel's cronies ([[G. D. Spradlin]]) to tell him that Caine has taken the bait.

Once in Berlin, Caine meets Paul Obermann (David Byrd) at the Berlin Zoo. Obermann explains operation "Genesis". This confirms Caine's hunch that Neeley was killed over Genesis. Obermann is then murdered outside the zoo. At his apartment, his niece Lisa ([[Marthe Keller]]) shows up to be interviewed by the police. At Obermann's memorial service, Caine asks Lisa to accompany him to act as his interpreter. Lisa agrees and they follow up on a lead that Obermann gave him regarding Professor Siebold who worked on the formula.

During their interview with Siebold ([[Ferdy Mayne]]), he reveals that the inventor of the formula, Dr. Abraham Esau ([[John Gielgud]]), is still alive. After they leave his apartment, Siebold is shot in the head through a window. When they meet up with Esau, he writes down the formula for Caine, after he makes Caine promise to make it public. Lisa and Caine make photocopies and send them to the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] and a Swiss energy company. Caine also hides two copies from Lisa, depositing them in the hotel's safe. Subsequently, he reveals that he has deduced that she is not Obermann's niece at all, but a spy sent to keep tabs on him. Lisa admits it, but claims she didn't sleep with him because of her orders.

At the border with East Berlin, Caine confronts Tadesco who relates how he knew Neeley, and what transpired after his capture by the Americans. As Tadesco walks towards his car, Lisa kills Tadesco, then walks towards [[East Berlin]]. At the airport before flying home to Los Angeles, Caine realizes the two copies of the formula in the hotel safe were replaced with fakes by Lisa, and that the only real copies are with the LAPD and the Swiss.

After landing in Los Angeles, he heads straight to Steiffel's office. Steiffel has kidnapped Caine's partner (Yosuta) and is holding him to exchange for the copy of the formula.

After exchanging the formula for Yosuta's release, Caine demands answers from Steiffel. Steiffel then outlines the cartel's plan since the end of the war, to keep the formula secret. They had been able to keep it secret until Swiss businessman, Tauber, began searching for the members of the original Genesis team, in the hope the team could recreate the formula.  Tauber's actions made the members of the Genesis team a liability to the cartel, so Steiffel had pulled strings to get Caine sent on a trip to Germany, which would serve as a cover for the cartel's plot to eliminate the remaining members.

Just before leaving, Caine reveals that he sent the formula to Tauber.

After their meeting, Steiffel makes a phone call to Tauber, asking him to keep the formula secret for another 10 years in exchange for a 25% share of his [[anthracite]] holdings. They negotiate briefly, and Tauber agrees to not use the formula for 10 years.

==Response==
The film opened to mixed to negative reviews from critics. It was said that behind the scenes, John G. Avildsen was after a print of the film he liked to be released. Studio infighting led him to demand the film to be left alone, but writer-producer Steve
Shagan decided to cut the film into a different version that ultimately ended in the theaters. Avildsen was bitter. He also 
wanted the print to be released to have little of Marlon Brando to emphasize the mystery. While critics liked the acting, they were not stunned by the plot and its twists. It also won [[Golden Raspberry]] nominations.

'''Tropical rainforests''' are [[rainforest]]s that occur in areas of [[tropical rainforest climate]] in which there is no [[dry season]] – all months have an average [[precipitation]] of at least 60&amp;nbsp;mm – and may also be referred to as ''lowland equatorial evergreen rainforest''. True rainforests are typically found between 10 degrees north and south of the [[equator]] (see map); they are a sub-set of the [[tropical forest]] [[biome]] that occurs roughly within the 28 degree latitudes (in the equatorial zone between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn]]). Within the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s biome classification, tropical rainforests are a type of [[tropical moist broadleaf forest]] (or tropical wet forest) that also includes the more extensive [[seasonal tropical forest]]s.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt;

Tropical rainforests are among the most threatened ecosystems globally due to large-scale fragmentation as a result of human activity. [[Habitat fragmentation]] caused by geological processes such as volcanism and climate change occurred in the past, and have been identified as important drivers of speciation.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082| doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12|bibcode = 2010Geo....38.1079S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, fast human driven habitat destruction is suspected to be one of the major causes of species extinction.  Tropical rain forests have been subjected to heavy [[logging]] and [[Deforestation|agricultural clearance]] throughout the 20th century, and the area covered by rainforests around the world is rapidly shrinking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/forests.brazil Brazil: Deforestation rises sharply as farmers push into Amazon], The Guardian, 1 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=5728 China is black hole of Asia's deforestation], Asia News, 24 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Tropical rainforests have existed on earth for hundreds of millions of years. Most tropical rainforests today are on fragments of the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic era]] supercontinent of [[Gondwana]].&lt;ref name="CorlettandPrimack2006"/&gt; The separation of the landmass resulted in a great loss of amphibian diversity while at the same time the drier climate spurred the diversification of reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; The division left tropical rainforests located in five major regions of the world: tropical America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and New Guinea, with smaller outliers in Australia.&lt;ref name="CorlettandPrimack2006" /&gt; However, the specifics of the origin of rainforests remain uncertain due to an incomplete fossil record.

===Other types of tropical forest===
{{Main|Tropical forest}}
Several biomes may appear similar-to, or merge via [[ecotone]]s with, tropical rainforest:

;Moist seasonal tropical forest: 
[[File:Rain Forest Daintree Australia.jpg|thumb|[[Daintree rainforest|Daintree]] "rainforest" in Queensland is actually a [[seasonal tropical forest]].]]
Moist [[seasonal tropical forest]]s receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. Some trees in these forests drop some or all of their leaves during the winter dry season, thus they are sometimes called "tropical mixed forest". They are found in parts of South America, in [[Central America]] and around the [[Caribbean]], in coastal [[West Africa]], parts of the [[Indian subcontinent]], and across much of [[Indochina]].

;Montane rainforests: 
These are found in cooler-climate mountainous areas, becoming known as [[cloud forest]]s at higher elevations. Depending on latitude, the lower limit of montane rainforests on large mountains is generally between 1500 and 2500&amp;nbsp;m while the upper limit is usually from 2400 to 3300&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=Bruijnzeel/&gt;

;Flooded rainforests: 
Tropical [[freshwater swamp forests]], or "flooded forests", are found in Amazon basin (the [[Várzea forest|Várzea]]) and elsewhere.

==Forest structure==
Rainforests are divided into different strata, or layers, with vegetation organized into a vertical pattern from the top of the soil to the canopy.&lt;ref name="Golley"/&gt; Each layer is a unique biotic community containing different plants and animals adapted for life in that particular strata. Only the emergent layer is unique to tropical rainforests, while the others are also found in temperate rainforests.

===Forest floor===
[[File:Gorilla gorilla04.jpg|thumb|Western lowland gorilla]]
The [[forest floor]], the bottom-most layer, receives only 2% of the sunlight. Only plants [[Adaptation|adapted]] to low light can grow in this region. Away from riverbanks, swamps and clearings, where dense undergrowth is found, the forest floor is relatively clear of vegetation because of the low sunlight penetration. This more open quality permits the easy movement of larger animals such as: ungulates like the [[okapi]] (''Okapia johnstoni''), [[tapir]] (''Tapirus'' sp.), [[Sumatran rhinoceros]] (''Dicerorhinus sumatrensis''), and apes like the [[western lowland gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla''), as well as many species of reptiles, amphibians, and insects.  The forest floor also contains [[decomposition|decaying]] plant and animal matter, which disappears quickly, because the warm, humid conditions promote rapid decay. Many forms of [[Fungus|fungi]] growing here help decay the animal and plant waste.

===Understory layer===
{{Main|Understory}}
The understory layer lies between the canopy and the forest floor. The understory is home to a number of birds, small mammals, insects, reptiles, and predators.  Examples include [[leopard]] (''Panthera pardus''), [[poison dart frog]]s (''Dendrobates'' sp.), [[South American coati|ring-tailed coati]] (''Nasua nasua''), [[boa constrictor]] (''Boa constrictor''), and many species of [[beetle|Coleoptera]].&lt;ref name="Newman, Arnold 2002"/&gt; The vegetation at this layer generally consists of shade-tolerant shrubs, herbs, small trees, and large woody vines which climb into the trees to capture sunlight. Only about 5% of sunlight breaches the canopy to arrive at the understory causing true understory plants to seldom grow to 3 m (10&amp;nbsp;feet). As an adaptation to these low light levels, understory plants have often evolved much larger leaves. Many seedlings that will grow to the canopy level are in the understory.

[[File:FRIM canopy.JPG|thumb|The canopy at the [[Forest Research Institute Malaysia]]]]

===Canopy layer===
{{Main|Canopy (ecology)}}
The canopy is the primary layer of the forest forming a roof over the two remaining layers. It contains the majority of the largest trees, typically 30–45 m in height. Tall, broad-leaved [[evergreen trees]] are the dominant plants.  The densest areas of [[biodiversity]] are found in the forest canopy, as it often supports a rich flora of [[epiphytes]], including orchids, bromeliads, mosses and lichens.  These epiphytic plants attach to trunks and branches and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer, but more diverse. It is suggested that the total arthropod species richness of the tropical canopy might be as high as 20 million.&lt;ref name=Erwin/&gt; Other species habituating this layer include many avian species such as the [[yellow-casqued wattled hornbill]] (''Ceratogymna elata''), [[collared sunbird]] (''Anthreptes collaris''), [[grey parrot]] (''Psitacus erithacus''), [[keel-billed toucan]] (''Ramphastos sulfuratus''), [[scarlet macaw]] (''Ara macao'') as well as other animals like the [[spider monkey]] (''Ateles'' sp.), African giant swallowtail (''[[Papilio antimachus]]''), [[three-toed sloth]] (''Bradypus tridactylus''), [[kinkajou]] (''Potos flavus''), and [[tamandua]] (''Tamandua tetradactyla'').&lt;ref name="Newman, Arnold 2002" /&gt;

===Emergent layer===
The emergent layer contains a small number of very large [[trees]], called ''emergents'', which grow above the general [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]], reaching heights of 45–55&amp;nbsp;m, although on occasion a few species will grow to 70–80&amp;nbsp;m tall.&lt;ref name="Golley"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bourgeron |first= Patrick S.|editor= Frank B. Golley |title=Tropical Rain Forest Ecosystems. Structure and Function |year= 1983 |edition= 14A|series= Ecosystems of the World |publisher= Elsevier Scientific |isbn= 0-444-41986-1 |pages= 29–47 |chapter= Spatial Aspects of Vegetation Structure}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nativetreesociety.org/worldtrees/sea_ei/malaysia/sabah2005.htm | title = Sabah | publisher = [[Eastern Native Tree Society]] | accessdate= 14 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of emergents include: ''[[Balizia elegans]]'', ''[[Dipteryx panamensis]]'', ''[[Hieronyma alchorneoides]]'', ''[[Hymenolobium mesoamericanum]]'', ''[[Lecythis ampla]]'' and ''[[Terminalia oblonga]]''.&lt;ref name=King/&gt; These trees need to be able to withstand the hot temperatures and strong winds that occur above the canopy in some areas. Several unique faunal species inhabit this layer such as the [[crowned eagle]] (''Stephanoaetus coronatus''), the [[king colobus]] (''Colobus polykomos''), and the [[large flying fox]] (''Pteropus vampyrus'').&lt;ref name="Newman, Arnold 2002" /&gt;

However, [[stratification (vegetation)|stratification]] is not always clear. Rainforests are dynamic and many changes affect the structure of the forest. Emergent or canopy trees collapse, for example, causing gaps to form. Openings in the forest canopy are widely recognized as important for the establishment and growth of rainforest trees.  It’s estimated that perhaps 75% of the tree species at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica are dependent on canopy opening for seed germination or for growth beyond sapling size, for example.&lt;ref name="Denslow"/&gt;

==Ecology==

===Climate===
[[File:El bosque inundado amazonico-cosmocaixa-2009 (2).JPG|thumb|Artificial tropical rainforest in Barcelona]]
Tropical rainforests are located around and near the equator, therefore having what is called an equatorial climate characterized by three major climatic parameters: temperature, rainfall, and dry season intensity.&lt;ref name="MalhiandWright2004"/&gt; Other parameters that affect tropical rainforests are carbon dioxide concentrations, solar radiation, and nitrogen availability. In general, climatic patterns consist of warm temperatures and high annual rainfall. However, the abundance of rainfall changes throughout the year creating distinct moist and dry seasons. Tropical forests are  [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|classified]] by the amount of rainfall received each year, which has allowed ecologists to define differences in these forests that look so similar in structure.  According to [[Holdridge life zones|Holdridge’s classification]] of tropical ecosystems, true tropical rainforests have an annual rainfall greater than 2&amp;nbsp;m and annual temperature greater than 24 degrees Celsius, with a [[potential evapotranspiration]] ratio (PET) value of &lt;0.25.  However, most lowland [[tropical forest]]s can be classified as tropical moist or wet forests, which differ in regards to rainfall. Tropical forest ecology- dynamics, composition, and function- are sensitive to changes in climate especially changes in rainfall.&lt;ref name="MalhiandWright2004"/&gt;

===Soils===

====Soil types====
Soil types are highly variable in the tropics and are the result of a combination of several variables such as climate, vegetation, topographic position, parent material, and soil age.&lt;ref name="Aragao2009"/&gt; Most tropical soils are characterized by significant [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] and poor nutrients, however there are some areas that contain fertile soils. Soils throughout the tropical rainforests fall into two classifications which include the [[ultisols]] and [[oxisols]]. Ultisols are known as well weathered, acidic red clay soils, deficient in major nutrients such as calcium and potassium. Similarly, oxisols are acidic, old, typically reddish, highly weathered and leached, however are well drained compared to ultisols. The clay content of ultisols is high, making it difficult for water to penetrate and flow through. The reddish color of both soils is the result of heavy heat and moisture forming oxides of iron and aluminium, which are insoluble in water and not taken up readily by plants.

Soil chemical and physical characteristics are strongly related to above ground productivity and forest structure and dynamics. The physical properties of soil control the tree turnover rates whereas chemical properties such as available nitrogen and phosphorus control forest growth rates.&lt;ref name=Moreira/&gt; The soils of the eastern and central Amazon as well as the Southeast Asian Rainforest are old and mineral poor whereas the soils of the western Amazon (Ecuador and Peru) and volcanic areas of Costa Rica are young and mineral rich. Primary productivity or wood production is highest in western Amazon and lowest in eastern Amazon which contains heavily weathered soils classified as oxisols.&lt;ref name="Aragao2009" /&gt; Additionally, Amazonian soils are greatly weathered, making them devoid of minerals like phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, which come from rock sources. However, not all tropical rainforests occur on nutrient poor soils, but on nutrient rich floodplains and volcanic soils located in the Andean foothills, and volcanic areas of Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mongabay.com/ Environmental news and information]. mongabay.com. Retrieved on 28 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxisols, infertile, deeply weathered and severely leached, have developed on the ancient [[Gondwana]]n [[Shield (geology)|shields]]. Rapid bacterial decay prevents the accumulation of humus. The concentration of iron and aluminium oxides by the [[Laterite|laterization]] process gives the oxisols a bright red color and sometimes produces minable deposits (e.g., [[bauxite]]). On younger substrates, especially of volcanic origin, tropical soils may be quite fertile.

====Nutrient recycling====
This high rate of decomposition is the result of phosphorus levels in the soils, precipitation, high temperatures and the extensive microorganism communities.&lt;ref name="Cleveland2006"/&gt; In addition to the bacteria and other microorganisms, there are an abundance of other [[decomposer]]s such as fungi and termites that aid in the process as well. Nutrient recycling is important because below ground resource availability controls the above ground biomass and community structure of tropical rainforests. These soils are typically phosphorus limited, which inhibits net primary productivity or the uptake of carbon.&lt;ref name="Aragao2009" /&gt; The soil contains microbial organisms such as bacteria, which break down leaf litter and other organic matter into inorganic forms of carbon usable by plants through a process called decomposition. During the decomposition process the microbial community is respiring, taking up oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. The decomposition rate can be evaluated by measuring the uptake of oxygen.&lt;ref name="Cleveland2006" /&gt; High temperatures and precipitation increase decomposition rate, which allows plant litter to rapidly decay in tropical regions, releasing nutrients that are immediately taken up by plants  through surface or ground waters.  The seasonal patterns in respiration are controlled by leaf litter fall and precipitation, the driving force moving the decomposable carbon from the litter to the soil. Respiration rates are highest early in the wet season because the recent dry season results in a large percentage of leaf litter and thus a higher percentage of organic matter being leached into the soil.&lt;ref name="Cleveland2006" /&gt;

====Buttress roots====
A common feature of many tropical rainforests is the distinct [[buttress root]]s of trees.  Instead of penetrating to deeper soil layers, buttress roots create a widespread root network at the surface for more efficient uptake of nutrients in a very nutrient poor and competitive environment. Most of the nutrients within the soil of a tropical rainforest occur near the surface because of the rapid [[turnover time]] and decomposition of organisms and leaves.&lt;ref name="Young2010"/&gt; Because of this, the buttress roots occur at the surface so the trees can maximize uptake and actively compete with the rapid uptake of other trees. These roots also aid in water uptake and storage, increase surface area for gas exchange, and collect leaf litter for added nutrition.&lt;ref name="Young2010" /&gt; Additionally, these roots reduce soil erosion and maximize nutrient acquisition during heavy rains by diverting nutrient rich water flowing down the trunk into several smaller flows while also acting as a barrier to ground flow. Also, the large surface areas these roots create provide support and stability to rainforests trees, which commonly grow to significant heights. This added stability allows these trees to withstand the impacts of severe storms, thus reducing the occurrence of fallen trees.&lt;ref name="Young2010" /&gt;

===Forest succession===
[[Ecological succession|Succession]] is an ecological process that changes the biotic community structure over time towards a more stable, diverse community structure after an initial disturbance to the community.  The initial disturbance is often a natural phenomenon or human caused event.  Natural disturbances include hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, river movements or an event as small as a fallen tree that creates gaps in the forest.  In tropical rainforests, these same natural disturbances have been well documented in the fossil record, and are credited with encouraging speciation and endemism.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

==Biodiversity and speciation==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2013}}
[[File:Young orang utan.JPG|thumb|upright|Young [[orangutan]] at [[Bukit Lawang]], Sumatra]]
Tropical rainforests exhibit a vast diversity in plant and animal species. The root for this remarkable speciation has been a query of scientists and [[ecologists]] for years. A number of theories have been developed for why and how the tropics can be so diverse.

===Interspecific competition===
[[Interspecific competition]] results from a high density of species with similar niches in the tropics and limited resources available. Species which "lose" the competition may either become extinct or find a new niche. Direct competition will often lead to one species dominating another by some advantage, ultimately driving it to extinction. Niche partitioning is the other option for a species. This is the separation and rationing of necessary resources by utilizing different habitats, food sources, cover or general behavioral differences. A species with similar food items but different feeding times is an example of niche partitioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Sahney, S.,  Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pleistocene refugia===
The [[Refugium (population biology)|theory of Pleistocene refugia]] was developed by [[Jürgen Haffer]] in 1969 with his article ''Speciation of Amazonian Forest Birds''. Haffer proposed the explanation for speciation was the product of rainforest patches being separated by stretches of non forest vegetation during the last glacial period.  He called these patches of rainforest areas refuges and within these patches allopatric speciation occurred. With the end of the glacial period and increase in atmospheric humidity, rainforest began to expand and the refuges reconnected.&lt;ref name=Haffer/&gt; This theory has been the subject of debate. Scientists are still skeptical of whether or not this theory is legitimate. Genetic evidence suggests speciation had occurred in certain taxa 1–2 million years ago, preceding the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name=Moritz/&gt;

==Human dimensions==

===Habitation===
Tropical rainforests have harboured human life for many millennia, with many Indian tribes in South- and Central America, who belong to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]], the [[Congo Pygmies]] in Central Africa, and several tribes in South-East Asia, like the [[Dayak people]] and the [[Penan people]] in [[Borneo]].&lt;ref name=human-occupation-of-tropical-rainforests-intro-2012/&gt; Food resources within the forest are extremely dispersed due to the high biological diversity and what food does exist is largely restricted to the canopy and requires considerable energy to obtain. Some groups of hunter-gatherers have exploited rainforest on a seasonal basis but dwelt primarily in adjacent savanna and open [[forest]] [[Environment (biophysical)|environments]] where food is much more abundant. Other people described as rainforest dwellers are hunter-gatherers who subsist in large part by trading high value forest products such as hides, feathers, and honey with agricultural people living outside the forest.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

===Indigenous peoples===
{{Main|Indigenous peoples}}
[[File:Índios isolados no Acre 7.jpg|thumb|Members of an uncontacted tribe encountered in the [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]] in 2009.]]
A variety of indigenous people live within the rainforest as hunter-gatherers, or subsist as part-time small scale farmers supplemented in large part by trading high-value forest products such as hides, feathers, and honey with agricultural people living outside the forest.&lt;ref name=human-occupation-of-tropical-rainforests-intro-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; Peoples have inhabited the rainforests for tens of thousands of years and have remained so elusive that only recently have some tribes been discovered.&lt;ref name=human-occupation-of-tropical-rainforests-intro-2012/&gt; These indigenous peoples are greatly threatened by loggers in search for old-growth tropical hardwoods like Ipe, Cumaru and Wenge, and by farmers who are looking to expand their land, for cattle(meat), and soybeans, which are used to feed cattle in Europe and China.&lt;ref name=human-occupation-of-tropical-rainforests-intro-2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/22/brazil-rainforest-awa-endangered-tribe 'They're killing us': world's most endangered tribe cries for help].

The pygmy peoples are hunter-gatherer groups living in equatorial rainforests characterized by their short height (below one and a half meters, or 59&amp;nbsp;inches, on average). Amongst this group are the Efe, Aka, [[Twa]], [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]], and [[Mbuti]] people of Central Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/congo/congo_people.html|title=People of the Congo Rainforest|work=Mongabay.com|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the term pygmy is considered pejorative so many tribes prefer not to be labeled as such.&lt;ref name=focus&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/w1033e/w1033e03.htm Forest peoples in the central African rain forest: focus on the pygmies]. fao.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], or Amerindians, include the [[Huaorani]], [[Ya̧nomamö]], and [[Kayapo]] people of the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]]. The traditional agricultural system practiced by tribes in the Amazon is based on swidden cultivation (also known as [[slash-and-burn]] or shifting cultivation) and is considered a relatively benign disturbance.&lt;ref name="Dufour"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herrera"/&gt; In fact, when looking at the level of individual swidden plots a number of traditional farming practices are considered beneficial. For example, the use of shade trees and fallowing all help preserve soil organic matter, which is a critical factor in the maintenance of soil fertility in the deeply weathered and leached soils common in the Amazon.&lt;ref name="Ewel"/&gt;

There is a diversity of forest people in Asia, including the [[Lumad]] peoples of the Philippines and the [[Penan]] and Dayak people of Borneo. The [[Dayaks]] are a particularly interesting group as they are noted for their traditional headhunting culture.  Fresh human heads were required to perform certain rituals such as the Iban "kenyalang" and the Kenyah "mamat".&lt;ref name="Jessup"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jessup, T. C.  |author2=Vayda, A.

===Resources===

====Cultivated foods and spices====
[[Yam (vegetable)|Yam]], [[coffee]], [[chocolate]], [[banana]], [[mango]], [[papaya]], [[macadamia]], [[avocado]], and [[sugarcane]] all originally came from tropical rainforest and are still mostly grown on plantations in regions that were formerly primary forest. In the mid-1980s and 1990s, 40 million tons of bananas were consumed worldwide each year, along with 13 million tons of mango. Central American coffee exports were worth US$3 billion in 1970.  Much of the [[Genetic diversity|genetic variation]] used in evading the damage caused by new [[Pest (organism)|pests]] is still derived from resistant wild stock. Tropical forests have supplied 250 cultivated kinds of [[fruit]], compared to only 20 for [[Temperate rainforest|temperate forests]]. Forests in [[New Guinea]] alone contain 251 tree species with edible fruits, of which only 43 had been established as cultivated crops by 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N. (1985). ''The primary source'', W.

===Ecosystem services===
{{Main|ecosystem services}}
In addition to extractive human uses, rain forests also have non-extractive uses that are frequently summarized as [[ecosystem services]]. Rain forests play an important role in maintaining [[biological diversity]], [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering and storing carbon]], global climate regulation, [[disease]] control, and [[pollination]].&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt; Half of the rainfall in the Amazon area is produced by the forests.

===Tourism===
[[File:Monteverde puente.jpg|thumb|[[Canopy walkway]] for seeing the diverse tropical forest in [[Costa Rica]]]]
Despite the negative effects of tourism in the tropical rainforests, there are also several important positive effects.
* In recent years [[ecotourism]] in the tropics has increased. While rainforests are becoming increasingly rare, people are travelling to nations that still have this diverse habitat. Locals are benefiting from the additional income brought in by visitors, as well areas deemed interesting for visitors are often conserved. ''Ecotourism can be an incentive for conservation, especially when it triggers positive economic change''.&lt;ref name=Stronza/&gt; Ecotourism can include a variety of activities including animal viewing, scenic jungle tours and even viewing cultural sights and native villages. If these practices are performed appropriately this can be beneficial for both locals and the present flora and fauna.
* An increase in tourism has increased economic support, allowing more revenue to go into the protection of the habitat. Tourism can contribute directly to the conservation of sensitive areas and habitat. Revenue from park-entrance fees and similar sources can be utilised specifically to pay for the protection and management of environmentally sensitive areas. Revenue from taxation and tourism provides an additional incentive for governments to contribute revenue to the protection of the forest.
* Tourism also has the potential to increase public appreciation of the environment and to spread awareness of environmental problems when it brings people into closer contact with the environment. Such increased awareness can induce more environmentally conscious behavior. Tourism has had a positive effect on wildlife preservation and protection efforts, notably in Africa but also in South America, Asia, Australia, and the South Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Fotiou, S.

==Conservation==

===Threats===

====Deforestation====
{{further|Rainforest#Deforestation}}

=====Mining and drilling=====
[[File:OkTediMine.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ok Tedi Mine]] in southwestern Papua New Guinea]]
Deposits of precious metals ([[gold]], [[silver]], [[coltan]]) and fossil fuels ([[oil]] and [[natural gas]]) occur underneath rainforests globally.  These resources are important to developing nations and their extraction is often given priority to encourage economic growth.  [[Mining]] and [[oil and gas drilling|drilling]] can require large amounts of [[land development]], directly causing [[deforestation]].  In [[Ghana]], a West African nation, deforestation from decades of mining activity left about 12% of the country's original rainforest intact.&lt;ref&gt;Ismi, A. (1 October 2003), [http://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/monitor/october-2003-canadian-mining-companies-set-destroy-ghanas-forest-reserves Canadian mining companies set to destroy Ghana’s forest reserves], Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives Monitor, Ontario, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Conversion to agricultural land=====
With the [[History of agriculture|invention of agriculture]], humans were able to clear sections of rainforest to produce crops, [[Slash and burn#Historical background|converting it to open farmland]]. Such people, however, obtain their food primarily from farm plots cleared from the forest&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Philip L. Walker 1998"&gt;Walker, Philip L.; Sugiyama, Larry and Chacon, Richard  (1998) [http://pages.uoregon.edu/sugiyama/docs/Diet%20and%20Dental%20Health.pdf "Diet, Dental Health, and Cultural Change among Recently Contacted South American Indian Hunter-Horticulturalists"], Ch. 17  in ''Human Dental Development, Morphology, and Pathology''. University of Oregon Anthropological Papers, No. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and hunt and forage within the forest to supplement this. The issue arising is between the independent farmer providing for his family and the needs and wants of the globe as a whole. This issue has seen little improvement because no plan has been established for all parties to be aided.&lt;ref name=Tomich/&gt;

Agriculture on formerly forested land is not without difficulties. Rainforest soils are often thin and leached of many minerals, and the heavy rainfall can quickly leach nutrients from area cleared for cultivation. People such as the [[Yanomamo]] of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]], utilize [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture to overcome these limitations and enable them to push deep into what were previously rainforest environments. However, these are not rainforest dwellers, rather they are dwellers in cleared farmland&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Philip L. Walker 1998"/&gt; that make forays into the rainforest. Up to 90% of the typical Yanamomo diet comes from farmed plants.&lt;ref name="Philip L. Walker 1998"/&gt;

Some action has been taken by suggesting fallow periods of the land allowing secondary forest to grow and replenish the soil.&lt;ref name=Jong/&gt; Beneficial practices like soil restoration and conservation can benefit the small farmer and allow better production on smaller parcels of land.

====Climate change====
{{Main|Climate change}}
The tropics take a major role in reducing atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]]. The tropics (most notably the [[Amazon rainforest]]) are called [[carbon sink]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} As major carbon reducers and carbon and soil methane storages, their destruction contributes to increasing [[Radiative forcing|global energy trapping]], atmospheric gases.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Climate change has been significantly contributed to by the destruction of the rainforests. A simulation was performed in which all rainforest in Africa were removed. The simulation showed an increase in atmospheric temperature by 2.5 to 5 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name=Semazzi/&gt;

===Protection===
Efforts to protect and conserve tropical rainforest habitats are diverse and widespread.  [[Tropical rainforest conservation]] ranges from strict preservation of habitat to finding sustainable management techniques for people living in tropical rainforests.  International policy has also introduced a market incentive program called [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] (REDD) for companies and governments to outset their carbon emissions through financial investments into rainforest conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Varghese|first= Paul|title= An Overview of REDD, REDD Plus and REDD Readiness|date= August 2009|url= http://www.rightsandresources.org/documents/files/doc_1220.pdf|accessdate= 23 November 2009|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100714065137/http://www.rightsandresources.org/documents/files/doc_1220.pdf|archivedate= 14 July 2010|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1367">The '''Ukishima Solar Power Plant''' (浮島太陽光発電所) is a 7 MW solar [[photovoltaic power station]] located on the waterfront in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]]. It is the first solar plant built by [[Tokyo Electric Power Company|Tepco]], and was completed on August 10, 2011. In the first year of operation, it produced 9,453 MWh, a [[capacity factor]] of 0.15,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/news/topics/images/120810a.pdf Monthly Total]&lt;/ref&gt; which was about 30% greater than anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/news/topics/1211710_2266.html First Anniversary of Ukishima Solar Power Station, One of the Largest Solar Power Stations in Japan Located in the Coastal Area of Kawasaki City]&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual feature of the plant is that the panels are mounted at a fixed angle of 10°, instead of the 30°, which would normally be considered optimal for this latitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/challenge/energy/megasolar/index-e.html Tepco real time monitor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vinča Institute of Nuclear Sciences''' is a [[nuclear physics]] research institution near [[Belgrade]], Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/serbia/facility/vinca.htm|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Vinca Special Weapons Facilities - Serbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding, the institute has also conducted research in the fields in physics, chemistry and biology. The scholarly institute is part of the [[University of Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bg.ac.rs/eng/memb/inst/en_instvinca.php|accessdate=2011-04-19|title=Members of the University of Belgrade - Vinča Institute of Nuclear Science|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526022807/http://www.bg.ac.rs/eng/memb/inst/en_instvinca.php|archive-date=2011-05-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The institute was established in 1948 as the Institute for Physics. Several different research groups started in the 1950s, and two research reactors were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/serbia/vinca.htm|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Vinca Special Weapons Facilities - Serbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute operates two research reactors; RA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/cgi-bin/rrdb.page.pl/rrdeta.htm?country=YU&amp;site=RA&amp;facno=584|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Former Yugoslavia: Research Reactor Details - RA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and RB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/cgi-bin/rrdb.page.pl/rrdeta.htm?country=YU&amp;site=RB&amp;facno=585|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Former Yugoslavia: Research Reactor Details - RB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[research reactor]]s were supplied by the [[USSR]]. The larger of the two reactors was rated at 6.5 MW and used Soviet-supplied 80% enriched [[uranium]] fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/2010/vinca-qa.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Q&amp;A: Fuel Repatriation Project from Vinca Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nuclear research program ended in 1968, while the reactors were switched off in 1984.

===1958 reactor incident===
On 15 October 1958, there was a [[criticality accident]] at one of the research reactors. Six workers received large doses of radiation; one died shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/1958YUG1.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=1958-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other five received the first ever [[bone marrow transplant]]s in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/1958YUG1.html Vinca reactor accident, 1958], compiled by Wm. Robert Johnston&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2011/03/14/giappone-due-esplosioni-di-idrogeno-a-fukushima-bloccato-un-altro-reattore/97466/ Nuove esplosioni a Fukushima: danni al nocciolo. Ue: “In Giappone l’apocalisse”], 14 marzo 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Six young researchers, all between 24 and 26 years, were conducting an experiment on the reactor, and the results were to be used by one student for his [[thesis]]. At some point, they smelled the strong scent of ozone. It took them 10 minutes to discover the origin of the ozone, but by that time they were already irradiated. The news was briefly broadcast by the state agency [[Tanjug]], but the news on the incident were then suppressed. The reasons included the position of state in the atmosphere of the Cold war division, but also a fact that the state commission concluded that the incident was caused by the carelessness and indiscipline of the researchers. The patients were first treated in Belgrade, under care of dr Vasa Janković. Thanks to the personal connections of the Institute director [[Pavle Savić]], who was collaborator of [[Irène Joliot-Curie|Irène]] and [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]], they were transferred to the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Curie Institute]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=Politika&gt;{{Citation | author = Budo Novović | title = Miris iz pedeset osme | trans-title = Scent from fifty-eight | newspaper = [[Politika]] | language = Serbian | date = 16 October 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/194634/Miris-iz-pedeset-osme }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, they were treated by oncologist [[Georges Mathé]]. Five researchers were heavily radiated: Rosanda Dangubić, Života Vranić, Radojko Maksić, Draško Grujić and Stijepo Hajduković, while Živorad Bogojević received a low dose of radiation. Mathé operated on all five of them, performing the first successful allogeneic [[bone marrow transplant]] ever performed on unrelated human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Dr. Georges Mathé, Transplant Pioneer, Dies at 88 | work = New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/health/research/21mathe.html | date = 20 October 2010 | author = Douglas Martin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The donors were all French: Marcel Pabion, Albert Biron, Raymond Castanier and Odette Draghi, a mother of four young children. The fifth donor was Dr. {{ill|Léon Schwartzenberg|fr}}, member of Mathé's team. On 11 November 1958, Maksić became the first man to receive a graft from an unrelated donor (Pabion). Out of five treated patients, only Vranić, died. Other recovered and returned to Belgrade to continue working in Vinča or other institutes. Several years later, Dangubić gave birth to a healthy baby girl.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

===Removal of radioactive waste===
In the 1980s, the waste was kept in the open. The waste was then transferred into two hangars, H1 and H2, while the ground was remediated. Until 1990, the waste from the entire country of Yugoslavia was stashed in Vinča. H2 also harbors the barrels with the [[depleted uranium]] and DU bullets, remnants of the ammunition collected on four locations in south Serbia after the [[1999 NATO bombing of Serbia]].&lt;ref name=burad&gt;{{ cite news | author = Aleksandar Apostolovski | title = Nuklearna sigurnost u zarđalim buradima | trans-title = Nuclear security in rusty barrels | newspaper = Politika | pages = 01 &amp; 07 | language = Serbian | date = 12 February 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/398178/Nuklearna-sigurnost-u-zardalim-buradima }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 990529-O-9999M-005.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Vinča Institute of Nuclear Sciences]]

In 2009, it was reported that the nuclear fuel storage pool, containing large quantities of [[radioactive waste]], was in poor condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLN86820|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Serbs send nuclear fuel to Russia, citing security|publisher=Reuters|first=Aleksandar|last=Vasovic|date=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, 2.5 tonnes of waste, including 13&amp;nbsp;kg of 80% [[Highly enriched uranium|enriched uranium]], were transported from Vinča to a reprocessing facility at [[Mayak]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/c_press/release_082302.pdf|title=NTI Commits $5 Million To Help Secure Vulnerable Nuclear Weapons Material|accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the [[IAEA]]'s largest ever technical cooperation project, and thousands of police protected the convoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2010/12/23/feature-01|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Serbia gets rid of dangerous nuclear material (SETimes.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/2010/vinca.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Massive Operation Safely Secures Serbian Nuclear Fuel in Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Removal of the nuclear waste allows decommissioning of Vinča's remaining reactor to be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=20&amp;nav_id=69789|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Nuclear decommissioning of Vinča this year|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104142120/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=20&amp;nav_id=69789|archivedate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the Law on radiation protection and nuclear safety was adopted. It envisioned that in maximum 10 years, that is by 2022, the waste from Vinča has to be transferred to the permanent and safe depository location. A new and modern hangar, H3, was built in the meantime but due to the legal procedures and licensing problems it is still closed. Though, it is meant to be only a transition location where the processed waste from H1 is to be kept before being transported to the permanent location. Still, as of 2018, a large quantities of nuclear waste remain in the Institute, the permanent location hasn't been selected, while the waste is not being treated and processed at all.&lt;ref name=burad/&gt;

The waste in Vinča is of low to mid-level radioactivity, which means it is potentially hazardous for the health and safety of wider area of Serbia, not just for Belgrade. Additionally, after removing all the radioactive waste, the institute can truly be transformed into the modern scientific-business park.&lt;ref name=burad/&gt;

In [[forestry]], the term '''widowmaker''' or '''fool killer''' describes a detached or broken limb or tree top and denotes the hazards that such features cause, being responsible for causing fatalities to [[forest]] workers. The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] describes widowmakers as "broken off limbs that are hanging freely in the tree to be felled or in the trees close by."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/logging/manual/felling/hazards/hazards.html |title=Logging eTool: Potential Hazards |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705171102/http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/logging/manual/felling/hazards/hazards.html |archivedate=2008-07-05 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Causes==
Widowmakers are often caused by fungal growth over a sustained period.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Other causes include damage from other falling trees or stress on a branch.

==Hazards==
Widowmakers may pose a risk to equipment or personnel working under or around the tree. They can become dislodged by wind or during tree felling, and are responsible for 11% of all fatal [[chainsaw]] accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, P.A. “Chainsaw Felling Fatal Accidents” 1991. American Society of Agricultural Engineers. MI. Vol. 34, No. 6, pp. 2600-2608.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) offers ways to eliminate risks by avoiding working beneath widowmakers, knocking them down, or pulling them down with a machine.

[[File:Yellowcake (03010301).jpg|thumb|Yellowcake]]
'''Yellowcake''' (also called '''urania''') is a type of [[uranium]] concentrate [[powder (substance)|powder]] obtained from [[In-situ leach|leach solutions]], in an intermediate step in the processing of [[uranium ores]]. It is a step in the processing of uranium after it has been mined but before fuel fabrication or [[uranium enrichment]]. Yellowcake concentrates are prepared by various extraction and refining methods, depending on the types of ores. Typically, yellowcakes are obtained through the milling and chemical processing of uranium [[ore]] forming a coarse powder that has a pungent odor, is insoluble in water, and contains about 80% uranium oxide, which melts at approximately 2880&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Overview==
The ore is first crushed to a fine powder by passing raw uranium ore through crushers and grinders to produce "pulped" ore. This is further processed with concentrated [[acid]], [[alkaline]], or [[peroxide]] solutions to leach out the uranium. Yellowcake is what remains after drying and filtering. The yellowcake produced by most modern mills is actually brown or black, not yellow; the name comes from the color and texture of the concentrates produced by early mining operations.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Yellowcake|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/yellowcake.html|work=U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission|accessdate=12 April 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Yellowcake|url=https://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/y/yellow-cake.htm|work=European Nuclear Society nuclear glossary|accessdate=10 July 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the compounds formed in yellowcakes were not identified; in 1970, the [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]] still referred to yellowcakes as the final precipitate formed in the milling process and considered it to be [[ammonium diuranate]] or [[sodium diuranate]]. The compositions were variable and depended upon the leachant and subsequent precipitating conditions. The compounds identified in yellowcakes include [[uranyl hydroxide]], [[uranyl sulfate]], [[sodium para-uranate]], and [[uranyl peroxide]], along with various [[uranium oxide]]s.  Modern yellowcake typically contains 70% to 90% [[triuranium octoxide]] (U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) by weight. Other oxides such as [[uranium dioxide]] (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[uranium trioxide]] (UO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1998 |title=Characterizing and Classifying Uranium Yellow Cakes: A Background |first=Donald M. |last=Hausen |journal=[[JOM (journal)|JOM]] |volume=50 |issue=12 |pages=45–47 |doi=10.1007/s11837-998-0307-5 |bibcode = 1998JOM....50l..45H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yellowcake is produced by all countries in which uranium ore is mined.

=== Further processing ===

Yellowcake is used in the preparation of uranium fuel for [[nuclear reactor]]s, for which it is smelted into purified UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for use in [[nuclear fuel#PWR fuel|fuel rods]] for [[Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor|pressurized heavy-water reactors]] and other systems that use natural [[Natural uranium|unenriched uranium]].

Purified uranium can also be [[uranium enrichment|enriched into the isotope U-235]]. In this process, the uranium oxides are combined with [[fluorine]] to form [[uranium hexafluoride]] gas (UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). Next, that undergoes [[isotope separation]] through the process of [[gaseous diffusion]], or in a [[gas centrifuge]]. This can produce [[low-enriched uranium]] containing up to 20% U-235 that is suitable for use in most large civilian electric-power reactors. With further processing, one obtains [[highly enriched uranium]], containing 20% or more U-235, that is suitable for use in compact nuclear reactors—usually used to power naval warships and [[submarine]]s. Further processing can yield [[weapons-grade]] uranium with U-235 levels usually above 90%, suitable for [[nuclear weapon]]s.

== Radioactivity and safety ==

The uranium in yellowcake is almost exclusively (&gt;99%) U-238, with very low radioactivity. U-238 has an extremely long [[half-life]], over 4 billion years, meaning that it emits radiation at a slow rate. This stage of processing is before the more radioactive U-235 is concentrated, so by definition, this stage of uranium has the same radioactivity as it did in nature when it was underground, as the proportions of isotopes are at their native relative concentration. Despite its long radioactive half-life, it has a shorter [[biological half-life]], 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/biohalf.html#c2&lt;/ref&gt; Yellowcake is as radiologically harmless as natural potassium-carrying minerals or [[Thorium_dioxide | thorium-oxide mantles]] used in paraffin fuel lanterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eerkens|first=Jeff W.|title=The nuclear imperative : a critical look at the approaching energy crisis : (more physics for presidents)|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht [Netherlands]|isbn=978-90-481-8666-2|page=43|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''YESCO''' is a privately owned manufacturer of electric signs based in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], founded by Thomas Young in 1920. The company provides design, fabrication, installation and maintenance of signs.

Many notable sign projects have been produced by YESCO, including the NBC Experience globe in [[New York City]], the historic [[El Capitan Theatre]] and [[Wax Museum]] [[marquee (sign)|marquee]]s in [[Hollywood]], the [[Reno Arch]], and in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Vegas Vic]], the [[Fremont Street Experience]], the Astrolabe in [[The Venetian (Las Vegas)|The Venetian]], the [[Wynn Las Vegas]] resort sign, and the Aria Resort &amp; Casino.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

== History ==
The company was created by Thomas Young on March 20, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvcontractorsboard.com/Newsletter/Fall_2003.pdf Nevada Contractors' Billboard 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; The young sign painter had left [[England]] just a decade earlier to immigrate with his family to Ogden, Utah. In the beginning, his shop specialized in coffin plates, gold leaf window lettering, lighted signs and painted advertisements. As the science of lighting and sign-making advanced, so did Tom Young’s signs.

In 1933, YESCO opened a branch office in the [[Apache Hotel]] in Las Vegas. The company erected their first neon sign in Las Vegas for the [[Boulder Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dmla.clan.lib.nv.us/docs/MUSEUMS/reno/exneon/neontext.htm Nevada Department of Cultural Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vintagelasvegas.com/post/136727953412/&lt;/ref&gt;

YESCO – soon became recognized as a leader in the sign industry, tackling large and complex sign projects. For example, it erected the first neon spectacular sign in Las Vegas for the Boulder Club in the late ’30s, and in 1995 it completed the four-block-long Fremont Street Experience canopy in Las Vegas.

YESCO continues to design, build, install and maintain signs and interior displays in areas. In recent years, YESCO has built a substantial outdoor digital media (billboard) division of its business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.signindustry.com/electronic/articles/2009-02-02-LB-Digital_Signage_Ho_staking_out_new_territories.php3&lt;/ref&gt; 

YESCO has approximately 1,000 employees, more than 40 offices, and operates three manufacturing plants featuring automated and custom equipment. Additional smaller manufacturing and service facilities are located through the United States and Canada.

YESCO offers sign and lighting service franchises in states east of Colorado and throughout Canada.

In 2015 Young Electric Sign Company sold YESCO Electronics, a subsidiary company, to Samsung Electronics of America, Inc. 
== Landmark Signs ==
===The NBC Experience Store Globe===
NBC ushered in the millennium with a new YESCO “message globe” in its [[NBC Experience]] store, located at Rockefeller Center in New York City. The electronic sign quickly became recognized as one of the most distinctive electronic displays in the world.

From the outside of the building, it looks like a brilliant illuminated globe. The 35’-diameter hemisphere is covered with thousands of full-color LEDs. Colorful video and special effects, along with animations provided by YESCO’s media services group, are displayed on the globe’s surface, telling the NBC story. When it was first turned on, it literally stopped traffic on West 49th Street.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Vegas Vic===
{{Main|Vegas Vic}}
Perhaps the world’s most recognized electronic sign,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Vegas Vic was designed by and built by YESCO. Upon its installation in 1951 over the Pioneer Club on historical Fremont Street, the 40'-tall electronic cowboy immediately became Las Vegas’s unofficial greeter.

===Wynn Las Vegas===
The {{convert|135|ft|m|adj=on}} tall marquee features a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} high, {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} wide, concave, double-faced LED message center with a first-of-its-kind “moving eraser.” Conceived by [[Steve Wynn]], the massive eraser glides silently and smoothly up and down over the LED message center, appearing to change the graphics as it goes. The eraser weighs 62,000 pounds, and is counterbalanced by a 62,000-pound weight inside the sign.&lt;ref name="fishertechnical1"&gt;http://www.fishertechnical.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=69:the-wynn-hotel-sign&amp;catid=23:theme-parks&amp;Itemid=37&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign uses 4,377,600 LEDs and the eraser is powered by a {{convert|300|hp}} motor at its base that runs a gear and cable system. The firm of FTSI engineered the 62,000-pound eraser’s movement, which is capable of speeds up to {{convert|10|ft/s|m/s}}.&lt;ref name="fishertechnical1"/&gt;The company has been instrumental in supporting the [[Neon Museum]], which is dedicated to preserving the neon signs and associated artifacts of Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a2zlasvegas.com/fse/fse05.html a2zlasvegas]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the retired signs include the sign for the [[Silver Slipper]] casino and Aladdin's lamp from the first version of [[Aladdin Las Vegas|Aladdin Casino]]. In 2004 the [[Binions]] Horseshoe sign [[Harrah's Entertainment|Harrah's]].

===The Fremont Street Experience===

== Key Individuals ==
===Founder===
Born in [[Sunderland, England]], in 1895, Thomas Young was 15 years old when his family emigrated to Ogden, Utah. Hard-working and talented, the boy applied his passion to making signs, becoming a Master Sign Writer. He began by creating wall-lettering and gold-leaf window signs, working for the Electric Service Company and the Redfield-King Sign Company in Ogden.

Young married Elmina Carlisle in 1916. Four years later, in 1920, he founded his own sign company: Thomas Young Sign Company, which specialized in coffin plates, gold window lettering, lighted signs and painted advertisements.

In 1932 Young expanded his business to Las Vegas, and within two years purchased the Ogden Armory for $12,000 to expand production capacity. He also started a branch in Salt Lake City in that year.

Young was elected president of the National Sign Association in 1936, serving for two terms. A year later, in 1937, he moved his family and YESCO headquarters to Salt Lake City, Utah, and continued expanding the business.

In 1969 Young turned over the reins of company leadership to his son who currently serves as the Chairman of the Board. The company is now managed by third and fourth generations of the Young family.

=== Designers ===
Some of YESCO's most prominent [[signage]] designers have included:
* [[Charles Barnard (designer)|Charles Barnard]] - designer of [[Vegas Vickie]]
* [[Rudy Crisostomo]] - designer of the [[Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino|Rio's]] column
* [[Dan Edwards (designer)|Dan Edwards]] - designer of Lucky the Clown of [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Circus Circus]]
* [[Jack Larsen Sr]] - designer of the [[Silver Slipper]]
* [[Kermit Wayne]] - designer of the [[Stardust Resort &amp; Casino|Stardust]]
* [[Pat Denner]] - designer of the [[Vegas Vic]] and [[Wendover Will]]
