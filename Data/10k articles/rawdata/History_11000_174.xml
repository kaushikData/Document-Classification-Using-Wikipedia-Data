      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5174">The '''Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala''', or '''ALMG''' (may be translated into English as ''Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages'') is a [[Guatemala]]n organisation that regulates the use of the 22 [[Mayan languages]] spoken within the borders of the republic. It has expended particular efforts on standardising the various writing systems used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almg.org.gt/index.php/inicio/historia |title=Historia ALMG |accessdate=2015-05-30 |work= |publisher=ALMG |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530224804/http://www.almg.org.gt/index.php/inicio/historia |archivedate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of its functions is to promote Mayan culture, which it does by providing courses in the country's various Mayan languages and by training Spanish-Mayan [[interpreter]]s.

It was founded on 16 November 1990 as an autonomous state organization, following publication of the ''Ley de la Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala'', which had been passed by [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]] the previous October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almg.org.gt/index.php/quienes-somos/mision |title=Información Institutcional - Mision |accessdate=2015-05-30 |work= |publisher=ALMG |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530224820/http://www.almg.org.gt/index.php/quienes-somos/mision |archivedate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is headquartered in [[Guatemala City]]'s Zone 10, in what was formerly the official residence of the [[Ministry of Defence (Guatemala)|Minister of Defence]] at the time of the [[Guatemalan Civil War|Civil War]], during which the [[Politics of Guatemala|government]] pursued a policy of [[genocide]] against the country's indigenous [[Maya people|Maya]] population.

==Orthography==
The ALMG have developed the most widely used orthographies for the Mayan languages. The Mayan languages in Mexico use different orthographies developed by [[INALI]].

[[File:Eytzinger - Thesaurus principum.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The first ahnentafel, published by Michaël Eytzinger in ''Thesaurus principum hac aetate in Europa viventium'' Cologne: 1590, pp. 146–147, in which Eytzinger first illustrates his new functional theory of numeration of ancestors; this schema showing [[Henry III of France]] as n° 1, ''de cujus'', with his ancestors in five generations. The remainder of the volume shows 34 additional schemas for rulers and princes of Europe using his new method.]]

An '''ahnentafel''' ([[German language|German]] for "ancestor table"; {{IPA-de|ˈʔaːnənˌtaːfəl|lang}}) or '''ahnenreihe''' ("ancestor series"; {{IPA-de|ˈʔaːnənˌʁaɪə|lang}}) is a [[genealogical numbering system]] for listing a person's direct ancestors in a fixed sequence of ascent. The subject (or [[proband]]) of the ahnentafel is listed as {{Numero|1}}, the subject's father as {{Numero|2}} and the mother as {{Numero|3}}, the paternal grandparents as {{Numero|4}} and {{Numero|5}} and the maternal grandparents as {{Numero|6}} and {{Numero|7}}, and so on, back through the generations. Apart from {{Numero|1}}, who can be male or female, all even-numbered persons are male, and all odd-numbered persons are female. In this [[conceptual model|schema]], the number of any person's father is double the person's number, and a person's mother is double the person's number plus one. Using this definition of numeration, one can derive some basic information about individuals who are listed without additional research.

This construct displays a person's [[genealogy]] compactly, without the need for a diagram such as a [[family tree]]. It is particularly useful in situations where one may be restricted to presenting a [[genealogy]] in plain text, for example, in [[e-mail]]s or [[newsgroup]] articles. In effect, an ahnentafel is a [[Binary tree#Methods for storing binary trees|method for storing a binary tree in an array]] by listing the [[node (computer science)|node]]s (individuals) in [[Tree traversal|level-order]] (in generation order).

The ahnentafel system of numeration is also known as: the '''Eytzinger Method''', for [[Michaël Eytzinger]], the Austrian-born historian who first published the principles of the system in 1590;&lt;ref&gt;Eytzinger, Michael, ''Thesaurus principum hac aetate in Europa viventium, quo progenitores eorum... simul ac fratres et sonores inde ab origine reconduntur... usque ad annum...'', Cologne: G. Kempensem, 1590 (1591). Note: In commentaries, his surname may appear in variant forms, including: Aitsingeri, Aitsingero, Aitsingerum, Eyzingern.&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Sosa Method''', named for [[Jeronimo de Sosa|Jerónimo (Jerome) de Sosa]], the Spanish genealogist who popularized the numbering system in his work ''Noticia de la gran casa de los marqueses de Villafranca'' in 1676;&lt;ref&gt;Jouniaux, Léo, ''Généalogie : pratique, méthode, recherche'', Quercy: Seuil, 2006, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Sosa–Stradonitz Method''', for [[Stephan Kekulé von Stradonitz]], the genealogist and son of [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz|Friedrich August Kekulé]], who published his interpretation of Sosa's method in his ''Ahnentafel-atlas'' in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Kekulé von Stradonitz, Stephan, ''Ahnentafel-atlas. Ahnentafeln zu 32 Ahnen der Regenten Europas und ihrer Gemahlinnen'', Berlin: J. A. Stargardt, 1898–1904. This volume contains 79 charts of the sovereigns of Europe and their wives.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ahnentafel" is a loan word from the German language, and its German equivalents are ''Ahnenreihe'' and ''Ahnenliste''.  An ahnentafel list is sometimes called a "Kekulé" after Stephan Kekulé von Stradonitz.

==Inductive reckoning==
To find out what someone's number would be without compiling a list, one must first trace how they relate back to the subject or person of interest, meaning one records that someone is the subject's father's mother's mother's father's father's&amp;nbsp;... Once one has done that, one can use two methods.

===First method===

Use the definition that a father's number will be twice that individual's number, or a mother's will be twice plus one, and just multiply and add 1 accordingly. For instance, someone can find out what number [[Sophia of Hanover]] would be on an ahnentafel of [[Peter Phillips]]. She is Phillips's mother's mother's father's father's father's mother's father's father's father's father's father's mother. So, we multiply and add:

:1&amp;times;2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3
::3&amp;times;2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7
:::7&amp;times;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;14
::::14&amp;times;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;28
:::::28&amp;times;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;56
::::::56&amp;times;2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;113
:::::::113&amp;times;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;226
::::::::226&amp;times;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;452
:::::::::452&amp;times;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;904
::::::::::904&amp;times;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1808
:::::::::::1808&amp;times;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3616
::::::::::::3616&amp;times;2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''7233'''

Thus, if we were to make an ahnentafel for Peter Phillips, Electress Sophia would be #7233.

===Second method===

This is an elegant and concise way to visualize the genealogical chain between the subject and the ancestor.

1. Write down the digit "1", which represents the subject, and, writing from left to right, write "0" for each "father" and "1" for each "mother" in the relation, ending with the ancestor of interest. The result will be the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] representation of the ancestor's ahnentafel number. Using the Sophia example, there is a translation of the chain of relations into a chain of digits.

:Sophia = Peter's mother's mother's father's father's father's mother's father's father's father's father's father's mother
:Sophia = 1110001000001

2. If needed, convert the ahnentafel number from its binary to its decimal form.

:Sophia = 1110001000001
:Sophia = 7233

==Deductive reckoning==

We can also work backwards and find what the relation is from the number.

===Reverse first method===

#One starts out by seeing if the number is odd or even.
#If it is odd, the last part of the relation is "mother," so subtract 1 and divide by 2.
#If it is even, the last part is "father," and one divides by 2.
#Repeat steps 2–3, and build back from the last word.
#Once one gets to 1, one is done.

On an ahnentafel of [[Prince William]], John Wark is number 116. We follow the steps:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| align="center" | 116/2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;58
| align="center" | 58/2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;29
| align="center" | 29&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;28 and 28/2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;14
| align="center" | 14/2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7
| align="center" | 7&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 and 6/2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3
| align="center" | 3&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and 2/2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1
|-
| align="center" | father
| align="center" | father
| align="center" | mother
| align="center" | father
| align="center" | mother
| align="center" | mother
|}

We reverse that, and we get that #116, John Wark, is Prince William's mother's mother's father's mother's father's father.

===Reverse second method===

1. Convert the ahnentafel number from decimal to binary.

:John Wark = 116
:John Wark = 1110100

2. Replace the leftmost "1" with the subject's name and replace each following "0" and "1" with "father" and "mother" respectively.

:John Wark = 1110100
:John Wark = Prince William's mother's mother's father's mother's father's father

== Calculation of the generation number ==
The generation number can be calculated as the [[logarithm]] to base 2 of the ahnentafel number, and rounding down to a full integer by truncating decimal digits. 

For example, the number 38 is between 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;=32 and 2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;=64, so log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(38) is between 5 and 6. This means that ancestor no.38 belongs to generation five, and was a great-great-great-grandparent of the reference person who is no.1 (generation zero).

==Example==
The example, shown below, is an ahnentafel of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]], listing all of his ancestors up to his fourth great-grandparents.

==Multiple numbers for the same person==
An ancestor may have two or more numbers due to [[pedigree collapse]]. For example in the above Ahnentafel for Prince William, Queen Victoria is both no.79 and no.81. She is no.79 because she was the great-great-grandmother of William's grandfather Prince Philip, and she is also no.81 because she was the great-great-grandmother of William's grandmother Queen Elizabeth II. The relationships are easier to follow using the ancestry tree with ahnentafel numbering.

== Other German definitions ==
[[File:Waldburg Ahnentafel.jpg|thumb|left|Ahnentafel of [[Sigmund Christoph von Waldburg-Zeil-Trauchburg]] ]]
[[File:Genealogical table for evidence of Aryan ancestry.jpg|thumb|140px|Ahnentafel published as an Ariernachweis]]
European nobility took pride in displaying their descent. In the German language, the term ''"Ahnentafel"'' may refer to a list of coats of arms and names of one's ancestors, even when it does not follow the numbered tabular representation given above. In this case the German "Tafel" is taken literally to be a physical "display board" instead of an abstract scheme.

In [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] required a person to prove non-Jewish ancestry with an [[Ariernachweis]] (Aryan certificate). The certificate could take the form of entries in the permanent [[Ahnenpass]] (that was sorted according to the ahnentafel numbering system) or as entries in a singular [[Arierschein]] (Aryan attestation) that was titled "Ahnentafel".

'''Yusufu Bala Usman''' ( 1945 - September 24, 2005) was Nigerian academic, politician and historian who was one of the scholars who shaped Nigerian historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Olufemi. "Falola, Toyin, and Saheed Aderinto. 2010. Nigeria, Nationalism, and Writing History." Africa Today 58.2 (2011): 156+. Academic OneFile. Web. 24 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Usman was the founder of the Centre for Democratic Development, Research and Training at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.

==Life==
Usman was born in [[Musawa]], Katsina State, his father was Durbin of Katsina and brother of [[Usman Nagogo]] and his mother was a daughter of [[Abdullahi Bayero]], former Emir of [[Kano Emirate|Kano]]. He attended Musawa Junior Primary School, Kankia Senior Primary School, Minna Senior Primary School and Government College, Kaduna.&lt;ref&gt;Gwadabe, M.M. "IV Yusufu Bala Usman (1945-2005)." Africa 80.1 (2010): 165+. Academic OneFile. Web. 24 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to study at the University Tutorial College and then at [[Lancaster University|University of Lancaster]] where he completed his studies with a degree in History and Political Science. He returned to Nigeria in 1967 to become a teacher at [[Barewa College]], Zaria where he taught until 1971. Usman started his graduate studies in 1970 at Ahmadu Bello University, earning his PhD degree in 1974. He started lecturing at the university as a part-time lecturer before being promoted to full-time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamji.com/article5000/NEWS5240.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Nigerian Second Republic, he was briefly the Secretary to the Kaduna State government under the [[People's Redemption Party|PRP]] led [[Balarabe Musa]] administration.

===Academic career===
Usman was a major figure among post colonial historians at Ahmadu Bello University, {{sfn|Mamdani|2012|p=88}} his outlook on African history involves support for the use of oral and linguistic sources along with written and archaeological sources. He felt all sources are subject to bias and that increased scrutiny of oral sources for distortions and colourings was not extended to many written sources by European writers. To him, the historian cannot be divorced from his education and molding as a scholar and the [[historicity]] of the European writers likely influenced some of their writings.{{sfn|Mamdani|2012|p=91}} Some of his reflections on the writing of African history includes a critique of [[Heinrich Barth]], a respected source among Western scholars, Usman thought Barth was too focused on the physical and genetic characteristics of those he was studying{{sfn|Mamdani|2012|p=92}} which he felt was a result of the dominant traditions of nineteenth century European history writing.

Borg's recent work on Roman tombs and burial customs of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, resulting in two monographs in 2013 and 2018, has been widely praised due to Borg's meticulous and thorough treatment of the material evidence:&lt;blockquote&gt;''The thorough treatment of surviving evidence ensures that this study will endure as the primary point of reference for its subject''.  John Pearce (commenting on ''Crisis and ambition: tombs and burial customs in third-century CE Rome'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/crisis-and-ambition-9780199672738?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#|title=Crisis and Ambition: Tombs and Burial Customs in Third-Century AD Rome|date=2013-11-15|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199672738|series=Oxford Studies in Ancient Culture &amp; Representation|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''Borg has produced through her contextual approach a detailed study of the burial customs of third-century Rome that puts the epoch in a place of its own, worthy of further specialist studies. Her study can also serve as first access point to many of the main burial monuments discussed. Her main arguments are convincing and open a new view on an interesting transitional period.''

'''Bernard Nieuwentijt''', '''Nieuwentijdt''', or '''Nieuwentyt''' (10 August 1654, [[West-Graftdijk]], [[North Holland]] &amp;ndash; 30 May 1718, [[Purmerend]]) was a Dutch philosopher, mathematician, physician, magistrate, mayor (of Purmerend), and theologian.  

==Career==

As a philosopher, Nieuwentyt was a follower of [[Descartes]] and an opponent of [[Spinoza]]. In 1695 he was involved in a controversy over the foundations of infinitesimal calculus with [[Leibniz]].&lt;ref name=Beth&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beth|first=Evert W|title=Critical Epochs in the Development of the Theory of Science|journal=British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|year=1950|volume=1|number=1|pages=27–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Nieuwentijt advocated 'nilsquare' infinitesimals (which have higher powers of zero), whereas Leibniz was uncertain about explicitly adopting such a rule - they did however come to be used throughout physics from then on.

He wrote several books (in [[Dutch (language)|Dutch]]) including his chief work ''Het regt gebruik der werelt beschouwingen, ter overtuiginge van ongodisten en ongelovigen'' [The True Use of World-Concepts] (1715), which argued for the existence of God and attacked Spinoza.&lt;ref name=Israel&gt;Jonathan Israel, ''Enlightenment Contested'', p. 385&amp;ndash;6&lt;/ref&gt; It went through several editions (1715, 1717, 1720, 1725, 1730, 1740) published by Joannes Pauli, and was translated into [[English (language)|English]] as ''The religious philosopher, or the right use of contemplating the works of the Creator'' (1718) and into [[French (language)|French]] as ''De l'existence de Dieu démontrée par les merveilles de la nature, ou traité téléologique dirigé contre la doctrine de Spinoza par un médecin hollandais''. [[Voltaire]] owned a copy of this book, and it was an influence on [[William Paley]].&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt; To the English version was added a letter to the translator by [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Nieuwentyt [https://books.google.ee/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Bj_JBAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=Nieuwentyt&amp;ots=hrx6XM-kmM&amp;sig=Ymgt6HW3SXz7yQ4QEJdBGZIuQTQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nieuwentyt&amp;f=false The Religious Philosopher: Or, The Right Use of Contemplating the Works of the Creator], Vol. II (transl. by John Chamberlayne) Cambridge: Cambr. Uni. Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Nieuwentyt's posthumously published ''Gronden van zekerheid'' [Fundaments of Certitude, or the Right Method of Mathematicians in the Ideal as well as the Real] (1720) argued Spinoza's 'geometrical method' was not the proper 'experimental method' of science. The work also contains a critique of the ontological argument similar to a later critique by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;ref name=Beth /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15565">In the ancient [[Mediterranean]] region, '''bugonia''' or '''bougonia''' was a [[ritual]] based on the belief that [[bee]]s were [[spontaneous generation|spontaneously (equivocally) generated]]  from a [[cow]]'s carcass, although it is possible that the ritual had more currency as a poetic and learned [[Trope (literature)|trope]] than as an actual practice.

==Description==
A detailed description of the bugonia process can be found in [[byzantine]] [[Geoponica]]:&lt;ref name="Geoponica"&gt;[[Geoponica]], [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k25235s/f479.image XV, 2, 22 sqq.].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Build a house, ten cubits high, with all the sides of equal dimensions, with one door, and four windows, one on each side; put an ox into it, thirty months old, very fat and fleshy; let a number of young men kill him by beating him violently with clubs, so as to mangle both flesh and bones, but taking care not to shed any blood; let all the orifices, mouth, eyes, nose etc. be stopped up with clean and fine linen, impregnated with pitch; let a quantity of thyme be strewed under the reclining animal, and then let windows and doors be closed and covered with a thick coating of clay, to prevent the access of air or wind. After three weeks have passed, let the house be opened, and let light and fresh air get access to it, except from the side from which the wind blows strongest. Eleven days afterwards, you will find the house full of bees, hanging together in clusters, and nothing left of the ox but horns, bones and hair.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The story of [[Aristaeus]] was an archetype of this ritual, serving to instruct [[bee keepers]] on how to recover from the loss of their bees. By extension, it was thought that fumigation with [[cow dung]] was beneficial to the health of the hive.

===Variations===
The idea that [[wasp]]s are born of the corpses of [[horse]]s was often described alongside bugonia. And given that European wasps bear a passing resemblance to European bees, it may be possible that the myth arose out of a mis-reported or misunderstood observation of a natural event.

Different variations are attested, such as simply burying the cow, or covering the corpse with mud or dung. Another variation states that use of the [[rumen]] alone is sufficient.

In [[Ancient Egypt]] the ox would be buried with its [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] projecting above the surface of the ground. When severed, bees would emerge from the base of the horns.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antigonus of Carystus]] through Beckmann&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beckmann"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Johann Beckmann]]|title=Antigoni Carystii historiarum mirabilium collectanea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D_uSMgAACAAJ|year=1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bugonia is described twice in the second half of Virgil's Georgics and frames the [[Aristaeus]] [[epyllion]] in the second half. The first description, opening the second half of the fourth book, describes a 'traditional' form of the ritual, followed by the tale of Aristaeus, who after losing his bees, descends to the home of his mother, the nymph [[Cyrene (nymph)|Cyrene]], where he is given instructions on how to restore his colonies. He must capture the seer, [[Proteus]], and force him to reveal which divine spirit he angered. Proteus changes into many forms but is bound at last and recounts how he caused the death of [[Eurydice]], thus angering the nymphs. the ritual demanded of Aristaeus by Cyrene upon his return is markedly different. He is to sacrifice four bulls, four heifers, a black sheep and a calf in an open glen. This second version served as the climax of a large work so may be based more on the traditional Roman sacrificial ritual than bugonia itself in order to close the Georgics in a more symbolically appropriate way. Thus the first version can reflect man's relation to the gods in the [[Golden Age]] and the later the current relation.&lt;ref name="Habinek"&gt;[[Thomas Habinek]] (1990). [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/8r85c02n Sacrifice, Society, and Vergil's Ox-born Bees]. UC Berkeley: Department of Classics, UCB.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Bougonia'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''"[[wiktionary:βοῦς|βοῦς]]"'', meaning ''"[[ox]]"''  and ''"[[wiktionary:γονή|γονή]]"'' meaning ''"[[Offspring|progeny]]"''. Furthermore, the expressions ''"bugenès melissae"'' and ''"taurigenae apes"'' meant ''"oxen-born bees"'' and the ancient Greeks would sometimes simply call honey bees ''"bugenès"'' or ''"taurigenae"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Heinrich Voss]], Virgil's Georgics p277; 1789&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient attestation==
Perhaps the earliest mention is by [[Nicander of Colophon]].&lt;ref name="Theriaca"&gt;[[Nicander of Colophon]], ''Theriaca'', [https://books.google.it/books?id=Lq1fAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA261#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 741].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexipharmaca"&gt;[[Nicander of Colophon]], ''Alexipharmaca'', [https://books.google.it/books?id=Lq1fAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA300#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 447].&lt;/ref&gt;

The process is described by [[Virgil]] in the fourth book of the ''[[Georgics]]''.&lt;ref name="Virgil"&gt;[[Virgil]], ''Georgica'', IV, 284 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other writers mention the practice.&lt;ref name="Fasti"&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Fasti'', [http://www.poesialatina.it/_ns/Testi/Ovidii/Fast1.htm I, 376-78].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metamorphoses"&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoseon libri'', [http://www.poesialatina.it/_ns/Testi/Ovidii/Met15.htm XV, 365-66].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Natural History"&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Naturalis historia'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D23 XI, 23 (70)], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D21%3Achapter%3D47 21, 47 (81)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="De natura animalium"&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus]], ''De natura animalium'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Aelian/de_Natura_Animalium/2*.html II, 57].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Honoratus"&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], ''In Vergilii carmina comentarii. Georgica'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0092%3Abook%3D4%3Acommline%3D285 IV, 285] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0092%3Abook%3D4%3Acommline%3D286 286].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Libanius"&gt;[[Libanius]], ''Progymnasmata'', exercises in enconium and invective, [https://books.google.it/books?id=kRi-If9IAOYC&amp;pg=PA261#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 8, 15].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seville"&gt;[[Isidore of Seville]], ''Origines'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Isidore/12*.html XII, 8, 2].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Outlines of Pyrrhonism"&gt;[[Sextus Empiricus]], ''Πυρρώνειοι Υποτυπώσεις'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17556/17556-h/17556-h.htm#PYRRHONIC_SKETCHES I, 41].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="De antro nympharum"&gt;[[Porphyry of Tyre]], ''Περὶ τοῦ ἐν Ὀδυσσείᾳ τῶν Νυμφῶν Ἄντρου'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/porphyry_cave_of_nymphs_02_translation.htm 15 and 18].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origen"&gt;[[Origen]], ''Contra Celsum'', [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen164.html 4, 57]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] [[Cyranides]]&lt;ref name="Cyranides"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] Greek authors|title=Cyranides|date=circa 300|pages=2.39.32}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is reported that [[worm]]s are born after one week and bees after three weeks.

[[Florentinus]] of the Geoponica reports the process as a proven and obvious fact:&lt;ref name="Geoponica"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If any further evidence is necessary to enhance the faith in things already proved, you may behold that carcases, decaying from the effect of time and tepid moisture, change into small animals. Go, and bury slaughtered oxen -- the fact is known from experience -- the rotten entrails produce flower-sucking bees, who, like their parents, roam over pastures, bent upon work, and hopeful of the future. A buried war-horse produces the hornet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Scepticism===
Pre-dating Nicander by a century, [[Aristotle]] never mentions bugonia and dismisses generation of bees from other animals.&lt;ref name="Aristotle"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Aristotle]]|title=On the Generation of Animals|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/generation/index.html|date=335-323 BC|page=759a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he is able to distinguish the [[eusocial|castes]] of [[drone (bee)|drone]], [[worker bee|worker]], and [[queen bee|"king"]] so he would certainly have been able to distinguish bees from their mimics. Later authors mention bugonia in commentaries on Aristotle's ''Physics''.&lt;ref name="Simplicus"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Simplicius of Cilicia]]|title=On Aristotle's Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cr2WSQAACAAJ|pages=9.239.18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Philoponus"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Philoponus]]|title=On Aristotle Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnYhAQAAMAAJ|date=circa 500|pages=16.107.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]] calls bees the "''factitious progeny of a decaying ox''".&lt;ref&gt;Archelaus, through [[Marcus Terentius Varro]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Celsus]] and [[Columella]] are recorded as having opposed the practice.

==Later sources==
[[File:Aristee.png|thumb|Aristeas and bugonia. Virgil's ''Georgics''. Lyon. 1517]]
[[Pietro de' Crescenzi]] refers to Bugonia circa 1304.&lt;ref name="Crescenzi"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Pietro de' Crescenzi]]|title=The Book of Rural Benefits|date=1304–1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1475, [[Konrad of Megenberg]], in the first German book of natural history, claimed that the bees are born from the [[skin]] and the [[stomach]] of an ox.&lt;ref name="Megenberg"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Konrad of Megenberg]]|title=Book of Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_EEAAAAYAAJ|year=1475}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Herren]] gives a detailed description of bugonia drawn from ''Geoponica''.&lt;ref name="Herren"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Michael Herren]]|title=Verdolmetschten Veltbau|year=1563}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Colerus]] whose book constituted the book of reference for many{{Which|date=June 2011}} generations of [[apiarist]]s expresses the same belief in bugonia.&lt;ref name="Colerus"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Johannes Colerus]]|title= Nutzlichen Bericht von denen Bienen oder Immen|year=1611}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method appears even in European apiculture books of the 1700s.&lt;ref name="Worlidge"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Worlidge]]|title=Dictionarium rusticum et urbanicum|year=1704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Abrahamic religions==
A similar story of the creation of bees is seen in the [[Book of Judges]], where [[Samson]] puts forward the riddle of [[Samson's riddle|"''out of the strong came forth sweetness,''"]] referring to a swarm of bees found inside a dead [[lion]]&lt;ref name="Tanakh"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Deuteronomist]]|title=Tanakh|url=http://www.online-bible.org.uk/judges/judges-14.htm|volume=[[Book of Judges]]|date=circa 500 BC|pages=14:14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bugonia belief is also reported in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]&lt;ref name="The Talmud of Jerusalem"&gt;{{cite book|author=scholars in the school of [[Johanan ben Nappaha]]|title=The Talmud of Jerusalem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7IXAAAAIAAJ|volume=Shabbath|date=circa 400|pages=1.3b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Babylonian Talmud]].&lt;ref name="Babylonian Talmud"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Rav Ashi]]|author2=[[Ravina I|Ravina]]|title=Babylonian Talmud|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mF0pAAAAYAAJ|volume=Baba Qamma|date=circa 400|page=16a}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[Philo]] offers this origin of bees as a possible reason why honey is forbidden as a sacrifice to [[Yahweh|Yaweh]].&lt;ref name="Philo"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Philo]]|title=The Special Laws|date=circa 50|url=http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book27.html|pages=1.291.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the belief==
[[File:Wasp mimicry.jpg|thumb|Bee and wasp mimics are diverse.]]
One explanation claims that any of the numerous [[Batesian mimics]] of bees with [[scavenger]] [[larva]] were mistaken for bees ("footless at first, anon with feet and wings"&lt;ref name="Virgil"/&gt;). More specifically, the [[hoverfly]] ''[[Eristalis tenax]]'' has received particular attention.&lt;ref name="Osten-Sacken1894"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Carl Robert Osten-Sacken]]|title=On the Oxen-Born Bees of the Ancients|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uFaAAAAQAAJ|year=1894|publisher=J.

Others argue that bee keepers would have understood that flies do not produce honey and give the explanation that ''[[Apis mellifera]]'' (western honey bee) resorts to any cavity, and in particular cavities of trees and rocks, but also in skulls and in thoracic cavities of large animal carcasses in which to construct a nest.&lt;ref name="Jackob"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Nickel Jacob]]|title=Gruendtlicher und nuetzlicher Unterricht von der Bienen und ihrer Wartung|year=1568|publisher=Ambrosius Fritsch|location=Görlitz, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HarissisHarissis2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Haralampos Harissis]]|author2=[[Anastasios Harissis]]|title= Apiculture in the prehistoric Aegean.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Lyle'sGoldenSyrup.jpg|thumb|left|A tin of Lyle's Golden Syrup]]
The story of Samson and the bees is celebrated on tins of [[Tate &amp; Lyle]] [[golden syrup]].

[[William Shakespeare]] knew of bugonia as he says in [[Henry IV, Part 2|Henry IV]]: "''Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb, in the dead carrion''".&lt;ref name="Shakespeare"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[William Shakespeare]]|title=King Henry IV, Part 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEvOAAAAMAAJ|year=1599|pages=act 4, scene 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Grene''' (1629–1697), was a [[Jesuit]] priest.

Grene was the son of George Grene, by his wife Jane Tempest, and brother of Father [[Martin Grene]]. He was born in 1629 in the diocese of [[Kilkenny]], Ireland, whither his parents, who were natives of England, and belonged to the middle class, had retired on account of the persecution. He made his early studies in Ireland; entered in 1642 the [[Colleges of St Omer, Bruges and Liège|college of the English Jesuits]] at [[Liège|Liege]], where he lived for five years; was admitted into the [[English College at Rome]] for his higher course in 1647; was ordained priest in 1653; and sent to England in 1654. He entered the [[Society of Jesus]] 7 September 1658, and was professed of the four vows 2 February 1668-9. He became English penitentiary first at [[Loreto, Marche|Loreto]], and afterwards at [[St. Peter's, Rome]]. In 1692 he was appointed spiritual director at the [[English College, Rome]], and he died there on 11 November 1697.

He rendered great service to historical students by collecting the scattered records of the English Catholic martyrs, and by preserving materials for the history of the times of persecution in this country. There is an account of those portions of his manuscript collections which are preserved at [[Stonyhurst]], [[Oscott]], and in the archiepiscopal archives of [[Westminster]].

{{Ancient Egyptian culture}}

'''Ancient Egyptian clothes''' refers to [[clothing]] worn in [[ancient Egypt]] from the end of the [[Neolithic]] period (prior to 3100 BC) to the collapse of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] with the death of [[Cleopatra]] in 30 BC. Egyptian clothing was filled with a variety of colors. Adorned with precious gems and jewels, the fashions of the ancient Egyptians were made for not only beauty but also comfort. Egyptian fashion was created to keep cool while in the hot desert.&lt;ref name="ancient-egypt-online1"&gt;[http://www.ancient-egypt-online.com/ancient-egypt-fashion.html Ancient Egypt Fashion]. Ancient-egypt-online.com. Retrieved on 2012-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of Egyptian clothing==
[[File:Ancient Egyptian linen, Late Period.jpg|left|thumb| Sample of ancient Egyptian linen from [[Saqqara]], dating to 390-343 BC ([[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]])]]
In ancient Egypt, [[linen]] was by far the most common textile. It helped people to be comfortable in the subtropical heat.&lt;ref name="ancient-egypt-online1"/&gt; Linen is made from the [[flax]] plant by spinning the fibers from the stem of the plant. Spinning, weaving and sewing were very important techniques for all Egyptian societies. Plant dyes could be applied to clothing but the clothing was usually left in its natural color.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;[http://www.womenintheancientworld.com/women's%20clothing.htm WOMEN'S CLOTHING AND FASHION IN ANCIENT EGYPT]. womenintheancientworld.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wool]] was known, but considered impure. Only the wealthy wore [[animal fiber]]s that were the object of [[taboo]]s. They were used on occasion for overcoats, but were forbidden in temples and sanctuaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient-egypt-priests.com/AE-Life-english.htm|title=Priests of Ancient Egypt Daily Life|website=www.ancient-egypt-priests.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peasants, workers and other people of modest condition often wore nothing, but the shenti (made of [[flax]]) was worn by all people. Slaves often worked naked.&lt;ref name="world4.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world4.eu/ancient-egyptian-costumes/|title=Ancient Egyptian costumes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common headdress was the [[Khat (apparel)|khat]] or [[nemes]], a striped cloth worn by men.

==Deities==
There were several [[ancient Egyptian deities]] related to fabrics, clothing and weaving, chiefly the god [[Hedjhotep]] and the goddess [[Tayt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zecchi|first=Marco|journal=Chronique d'Égypte|volume=LXXVI|year=2001|title=The god Hedjhotep|pp=5&amp;ndash;19|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharaohs==
Royal clothing is particularly well documented, as well as the clothing and crowns of the [[Pharaohs]].The [[pharaohs]] would often wear animal skins, usually [[leopard]] or [[lion]], as a sign of their station.&lt;ref name="world4.eu"/&gt;

==Men==
From about 2130 BC during the Old Kingdom, garments were simple.&lt;ref name="touregypt1"&gt;[http://www.touregypt.net/egypt-info/magazine-mag01012001-magf4.htm The Latest Fashions in Ancient Egypt]. Touregypt.net (2011-06-13). Retrieved on 2012-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The men wore wrap around skirts known as the [[shendyt]], which were belted at the waist, sometimes pleated or gathered in the front.&lt;ref name="touregypt1"/&gt; During this time, men's skirts were short. As the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] (1600 BC), came, the skirt was worn longer.&lt;ref name="touregypt1"/&gt; Then, around 1420 BC, there was a light tunic or [[blouse]] with sleeves, as well as a pleated [[petticoat]].

==Women==

[[File:Porteuse d'offrandes 1 XI°dynastie.gif|thumb|145px|Egyptian woman in a kalasiris]]
During the Old, Middle and New Kingdom, ancient Egyptian women mostly wore a simple sheath dress called a ''kalasiris''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tierney|first=Tom|title=Ancient Egyptian fashions|year=1999|publisher=Dover|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=9780486408064|pages=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cdkJefk-yDcC&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women's clothing in ancient Egypt was more conservative than men's clothing.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=James. C|title=women's clothing and Fashions in Ancient Egypt|url=http://www.womenintheancientworld.com/women's%20clothing.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dresses were held up by one or two straps and were worn down to the ankle, while the upper edge could be worn above or below the breasts.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; The length of the dress denoted the social class of the wearer.&lt;ref name=resha&gt;[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/clothing.htm#rem8 Ancient Egypt: Clothing]. Reshafim.org.il. Retrieved on 2012-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Beading or feathers were also used as an embellishment on the dress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723154011/http://www2.sptimes.com/Egypt/EgyptCredit.4.2.html Egypt: Daily Life]. sptimes.com&lt;/ref&gt; Over the dress, women had a choice of wearing shawls, capes, or robes. The shawl was a piece of fine linen cloth around 4 feet wide by 13 or 14 feet long.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; This was mostly worn pleated as well.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Until the mid-[[Eighteenth Dynasty]] women wore a tight-fitting sheath dress, a simple garment that falls from just below the breasts to just above the ankles, being held up by two shoulder straps. On statues the straps cover the breasts, but in painting and relief the single breast depicted in profile is exposed. The dress hugs the body with no slack. Also when women are shown in movement, sitting or kneeling, the dress still clings to the outline of the body as if elasticated. However Egyptian clothes were mostly made from linen, which tends to sag. Surviving dresses consist of a body made from a tube of material sewn up one side, supported not by straps but by a [[bodice]] with sleeves. In contrast to dresses shown in art, such linen garments tend to be baggy, and would conceal rather than reveal the body.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Robin: ''Women in ancient Egypt'' (p. 181-2), British museum press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-7141-0956-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==
Children wore no clothing until 6 years old. Once they turned six years old they were allowed to wear clothing to protect them from the dry heat. A popular hairstyle among the children was the side-lock, an unshaved length of hair on the right side of the head. Even though children usually wore no clothing, they wore jewelry such as anklets, bracelets, collars, and hair accessories.&lt;ref name="touregypt2"&gt;Springer, I. (December, 2010) [http://www.touregypt.net/egypt-info/magazine-mag11012000-magf1.htm Egypt: Tour Egypt Monthly: A Kid in Ancient Egypt]. Touregypt.net. Retrieved on 2012-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt; When they grew up, they wore the same styles as their parents.

==Wigs==
Wigs were worn by the wealthy of both sexes. Made from human hair and sometimes supplemented with date palm fiber, they were often styled in tight curls and narrow braids.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Lucas et al., Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries. Dover, 1934. p. 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt; For special occasions, both men and women could top their wigs with cones of perfumed fat that would melt to release their fragrance and condition the hair.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhri, S, Asian Journal of Pharmaceutics (Jul 2009), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewelry==
Jewelry was very popular in [[ancient Egypt]], no matter the social class. It was heavy and rather voluminous. The main reason for wearing jewelry is because of its aesthetic function. The Egyptians were quite soberly dressed in white linen fabrics, and jewelry offered a possibility for contrast. The Egyptian preference was towards the use of bright colors, lustrous stones and precious metals. Gold was won in large quantities in the eastern desert of Egypt, but also came from Nubia, that was an Egyptian colony for centuries.

On the other hand, silver was rare and was imported from Asia. Therefore, it was silver that was often considered more precious than gold. The eastern desert was also an important source for colorful semi-precious stones such as carnelian, amethyst and jasper. In the Sinai were turquoise mines, the deep blue lapis lazuli had to come from far away Afghanistan. Glass and faience (glaze over a core of stone or sand) were favorites to replace rocks because they could be produced in many colors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://farlang.com/ancient-egyptian-jewelry-and-amulets – Ancient Egyptian Jewelry]. Dr. Maarten van Raven, Curator Archaeological Museum, Leiden, the Netherlands 2016-01-02. Retrieved on 2016-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptians became very skilled when making jewelry from turquoise, metals like gold and silver, and small beads. Both men and women adorned themselves with earrings, bracelets, rings, necklaces and neck collars that were brightly colored. Those who could not afford jewelry made from gold or other stones would make their jewelry from colored pottery beads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyonthenet.com/Egyptians/clothing.htm Clothing – Ancient Egypt]. Historyonthenet.com (2010-04-30). Retrieved on 2012-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

One creation that was specific to ancient Egypt was the [[gorgerine]], an assembly of metal discs worn on the chest, either over bare skin or over a shirt, and attached in the back.

==Cosmetics==
[[File:Egyptian cosmetic set.jpg|thumb|Ancient Egyptian cosmetic set from c. 1550–1458 BC, featuring, from left to right, a kohl tube, a razor, a pair of tweezers, a whetstone, and a mirror]]
[[Embalming]] allowed the development of [[cosmetics]] and [[perfumes]].{{clarify|date=May 2017}} The perfumes of Egypt were the most numerous, but also the most sought and the costliest of [[ancient history|antiquity]], which used them extensively. The Egyptians used makeup most of all the ancient people. Nails and hands were painted with [[henna]].

Black [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]], which was used to mark eyes, was obtained from [[galena]]. Eye shadow was made from crushed [[malachite]]. Red, which was applied to lips, came from [[ochre]]. These products were mixed with animal fat to make them compact and to preserve them. They wore [[galena]] or crushed [[malachite]] not just to enhance beauty, but because they believed it kept dust and dirt from getting into their eyes. For this reason, both men and women wore it.

Findings were published by American Chemical Society in the journal Analytic Chemistry suggest that the use of lead in makeup was intentional. Findings suggest that the lead in combination with salts produced naturally by the body produce nitric oxide which boosts the immune system. It is believed that the production and result were intentional. The increase in immune productivity would help to prevent infections like conjunctivitis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/01/100114-cleopatra-eye-makeup-ancient-egyptians/ Cleopatra's Eye Makeup Warded Off Infections?]. News.nationalgeographic.com. Retrieved on 2012-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Footwear==
Footwear was the same for both sexes. It consisted of [[sandals]] of leatherwork, or for the priestly class, [[papyrus]]. Since Egyptians were usually barefoot, sandals were worn on special occasions or at times when their feet might get hurt.&lt;ref name=resha/&gt;

The '''dashiki''' is a colorful garment for women and men worn mostly in [[West Africa]]. It covers the top half of the body. It has [[Formal wear|formal]] and informal versions and varies from simple draped clothing to fully tailored suits. A common form is a loose-fitting pullover garment, with an ornate V-shaped collar, and tailored and embroidered neck and sleeve lines. It is frequently worn with a brimless [[Kufi]] cap, which is worn in Islamic communities in Africa and the African diaspora, and a pair of pants.

The name dashiki is Yoruba adapted word from Hausa for “danshiki” or "dan ciki" means “inner garment” in [[Hausa language|Hausa]], as compared to "Babban riga" that is worn over "dan ciki" as the outer garment.

== Versions ==
The informal version of the danshiki is a traditional print or embroidered danshiki. Three formal versions exist. The first type consists of a danshiki, ''sokoto'' (drawstring trousers), and a matching [[kufi]]. This style is called a ''danshiki suit'' or ''danshiki trouser set'' and it is the attire worn by most grooms during wedding ceremonies. The second version consists of an ankle-length shirt, matching kufi, and sokoto and is called a [[Senegalese kaftan]]. The third type consists of a danshiki and matching trousers. A flowing gown is worn over these. This type is called a [[grand boubou]] or an [[agbada]].

There are several different styles of danshiki suits available from clothing stores. The type of shirt included in the set determines the name. The ''traditional'' danshiki suit includes a thigh-length shirt. The short sleeve, traditional style is preferred by purists. A ''long'' danshiki suit includes a shirt that is knee-length or longer. However, if the shirt reaches the ankles, it is a [[Senegalese kaftan]]. Finally, the ''lace'' dashiki suit includes a shirt made of lace. A hybrid of the danshiki and caftan worn by females is a traditional male danshiki with a western skirt.

It also goes by the name 'Angelina' in [[Ghana]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]. It was given its name after a [[Ghanaian]] highlife group released a popular song titled "Angelina" which coincided with the cloth. It was originally worn by the Hausa of northern Ghana for traditional functions, and with time, it became a part of the Ghanaian culture as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Wedding colors ===
Grey is the traditional color for some West African weddings.&lt;ref name="Bridalzine"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bridalzine.com/culture1.html|title=African American Wedding Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some grooms wear white danshiki suits during wedding ceremonies.&lt;ref name="IBESTBUYSELL"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibestbuysell.com/african-wedding-dress/|title=African Wedding Dress}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some couples wear non-traditional colours. The most common non-traditional colors are purple and blue.

== In the United States ==
The danshiki found a market in America during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Black Power movement]]. The term ''danshiki'' began appearing in print at least as early as 1967. Reporting on the [[1967 Newark riots]] in the ''[[The New York Amsterdam News|Amsterdam News]]'' on July 22, 1967, George Barner refers to a new African garment called a "''dan''shiki". An article by Faith Berry in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' includes it on July 7, 1968. "Danshiki" formally appeared in the ''[[Webster's New World Dictionary]]'', 1st College Edition of 1970/72.  It cites J. Benning with the first written usage of the word in 1967.  J. Benning, M. Clarke, H. Davis and W. Smith were founders of New Breed of [[Harlem]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], the first manufacturer of the garment in the United States.

The danshiki was featured in the movies ''[[Uptight (film)|Uptight]]'' (1968), ''[[Putney Swope]]'' (1969), and the weekly television series ''[[Soul Train]]'' (1971). In the [[Sanford and Son]] episode "Lamont Goes African" features Sanford's son Lamont wearing a Dashiki as part of his attempt to return to his African roots. [[Jim Brown]], [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], and [[Bill Russell]] were among the well-known [[African-American]] athletes and entertainers who wore the dashiki on talk shows. [[Hippies]] also adopted danshikis into their wardrobe as a means to express [[counterculture]] values.&lt;ref&gt;http://fashion-history.lovetoknow.com/clothing-types-styles/dashiki&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[District of Columbia]] mayor and council member [[Marion Barry]] was known for wearing a danshiki leading up to elections. Danshikis have been seen on many musicians and singers, mostly [[African Americans]], including [[Beyoncé]], [[Rihanna]], [[ScHoolboy Q]], [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]], and many others.

[[Fred Hampton]] of the [[Black Panther Party]] made note of black business owners wearing danshikis in his 1969 speech ''Power Anywhere Where There's People'': "[A]nybody who comes into the community to make profit off the people by exploiting them can be defined as a capitalist. And we don't care how many programs they have, how long a danshiki they have. Because political power does not flow from the sleeve of a dashiki; [[Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun|political power flows from the barrel of a gun]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/fhamptonspeech.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Zappa]] in his 1981 song "[[You Are What You Is (song)|You Are What You Is]]" mentions a black guy who "sold his danshiki for some [[Jordache]] jeans" in an effort to feel closer to the Caucasian look and culture.

'''Edmund Borlase''' (1620&amp;ndash;1682) was an Anglo-Irish historian and physician.

==Life==
He was son of Sir John Borlase, who received the appointment of master-general of the ordnance, Ireland, in 1634, and held office as lord justice there from 1640 to 1643. Edmund Borlase is stated by [[Anthony à Wood]] to have been educated at Dublin, and to have obtained the degree of doctor in physic at Leyden in 1650.{{sfn|Gilbert|1886}}

He subsequently settled in Chester, where, according to Wood, he 'practised his faculty with good success to his dying day.' Borlase in 1660 received the degree of doctor of medicine from the [[University of Oxford]]. He enjoyed the patronage of [[Charles Stanley, 8th Earl of Derby]], to whom he dedicated a treatise, published in 1670, on 'Latham Spa in Lancashire, with some remarkable Cases and Cures affected by it.'{{sfn|Gilbert|1886}}

In 1676, Borlase published at London an octavo volume of 284 pages, with the following title: ''The Reduction of Ireland to the Crown of England; with the Governours since the Conquest by King Henry II, anno 1172 ; with some passages in their government. A brief account of the Rebellion, anno Dom. 1641. Also, the original of the Universitie of Dublin, and the Colledge of Physicians.'' The work was mainly a compilation from printed books, and terminated at the year 1672. In it, the author introduced some medical observations on diseases prevalent in Ireland. Among remedies for dysentery, he mentioned that recently, in cases of extremity, great use had 'been made of swine's dung drank in a convenient vehicle.' The compilation of a history of affairs in Ireland from 1641 to 1662 was undertaken by Borlase chiefly with the object of demonstrating that the administrators of the English government there had not acted adversely to the royal interests nor unjustly towards Irish Catholics.

For the purposes of his work, Borlase obtained a copy of an unpublished treatise on Irish affairs by [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]]. This he unskillfully altered and interpolated, to make it accord with his views. Borlase's work, after expurgation by Sir [[Roger L'Estrange]], was published at London in 1680: 'The History of the execrable Irish Rebellion, trac'd from many preceding acts to the grand eruption, the 23 of October, 1641, and thence pursued to the Act of Settlement, 1662.' The publication attracted little attention, owing to the defective style and absence of the author's name.{{sfn|Gilbert|1886}}

The appearance of Borlase's work induced [[James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven]], to publish in the same year, at London, a small volume of 'Memoirs,' in which he gave an account of his 'engagement and carriage in the wars of Ireland.' Castlehaven's 'Memoirs' elicited a commentary which appeared at London in 1681, under the title of 'A Letter from a Person of Honour in the Country.' 
Borlase, at the instance of [[Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey]], published in the following year 'Brief Reflections on the Earl of Castlehaven's Memoirs of his engagement and carriage in the wars of Ireland,' &amp;c., London, 1682. This publication was anonymous, but the initials ' E. B.' were appended to the address to the king, prefixed to it.{{sfn|Gilbert|1886}}

Borlase gave Bishop [[Gilbert Burnet]] some materials for the 'History' of the Reformation,' among which were papers relative to the English translation of the Bible.{{sfn|Gilbert|1886}}

The date of Borlase's death has not been mentioned. A copy of Borlase's 'History of the Irish Rebellion' by him, in which he re-inserted the portions excised by the licenser of the press, together with Borlase's collections and correspondence connected with his 'History,' is now in the Stowe collection at the British Museum. Some of these papers were printed at Dublin in 1882, in the 'History of the Irish Confederation and War in Ireland, 1641-1643. Borlase's ' History ' was republished at Dublin in 1743, without the author's name. In this edition the word ‘execrable’ was omitted from the title, and some documents not previously printed were given in an appendix to the volume.{{sfn|Gilbert|1886}}

[[File:Frantz Funck-Brentano 02.jpg|thumb|right|Frantz Funck-Brentano]]
'''Frantz Funck-Brentano''' (15 June 1862 – 13 June 1947) was a French historian and librarian. He was born in the [[Munsbach Castle|castle of Munsbach]] (Luxembourg) and died at [[Montfermeil]]. He was a son of [[Théophile Funck-Brentano]].

== Biography ==
After graduating at a young age from the prestigious [[École Nationale des Chartes]], Frantz Funck-Brentano was in 1885 named curator of the [[Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal]], of which he never became director. His research focussed especially on the [[Ancien Régime in France|Ancien Régime]], primarily because this library housed the archive of documents from the [[Bastille]], which represented an incomparable source for the history, in particular the [[political history]] of the Ancien Régime. Funck-Bentano himself compiled the voluminous and exhaustive catalogue of this archive while he was curator. The depths of this resource led him to study all aspects of the history of the Ancien Régime: its institutions, peculiarities, personalities and famous events, which he made the subject of highly referenced books that brought great success to the library.

In 1900 he became replacement professor at the [[Collège de France]], in the chair of comparative legislative history, where he dealt with the foundation of western European cities.

In 1905 he was appointed a principal lecturer of the [[Alliance française]] to the United States. At the same time he was mandated by the French government to study the spread of [[French literature]] in the United States, Canada and [[Cuba]]. In this capacity he spoke before President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the [[White House]]. On his return to France, he was made a knight of the [[Légion d'honneur]].

In 1909 he spoke before French circles of [[Austria-Hungary]], in [[Vienna]], [[Prague]] and [[Budapest]], on the history of France through the ages.

After this he served several times as lecturer for the Alliance française, in the Netherlands, England, Denmark, [[Sweden and Norway]], [[Romania]] and Russia. In 1907 the [[Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres]] awarding him the important [[Prix Berger]] for his works on the [[history of Paris]]. He was elected member of the [[Académie des sciences morales et politiques]] in 1928, and president of the [[Société des études historiques]].

Alongside his academic work, Funck-Brentano pursued a literary career, writing plays and popular historical works, and in journalism: he contributed notably to ''Minerva'', a nationalist and monarchist historical and critical review, to ''[[Revue d'Action française]]'' and [[Charles Maurras]]'s ''[[Action Française]]''. His involvement with extreme right-wing politics also influenced his work; a major part of his ''Marat ou le mensonge des mots'' (1941) consists of a virulent attack on [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]], whom he describes as a "semite", riddled with classic [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] themes of the day.

One of his sons, Christian Funck-Bentano (1894&amp;ndash;1966) was among the founders of the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]''; another, Claude Théophile (born 1892) was shot down on the front at [[Vosges]] in February 1916. He is commemorated at [[Pair-et-Grandrupt]].

He authored ''Lendas da Índia'' (Legends of India), one of the earliest and most important works about Portuguese rule in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Gaspar Corrêa, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F-xYbAvY_xAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Gaspar%20Corr%C3%AAa&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false] "The three voyages of Vasco da Gama: and his viceroyalty", Introduction, Adamant Media Corporation, 2001, {{ISBN|1-4021-9543-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Avelar"&gt;[http://www.fcsh.unl.pt/cham/eve/content.php?printconceito=814 Ana Paula Avelar, "Gorreia, Gaspar"], in CHAM Letra&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:Hormuz fort-Correia.png|thumb|Hormuz Fortress from the ''Lendas da Índia'' (c.1550)]]
Little is known of the author or his family origins and birthplace. It is assumed that he was born in 1492.&lt;ref name="BAndrade"/&gt; He lived mostly in [[Portuguese India]], reportedly arriving around 1512-14 to serve as a soldier and then chosen as secretary to [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], for which he was very proud. He returned to Portugal in 1529 for some time but later returned to India. His work ''Lendas da Índia'', though written in a rude style,&lt;ref&gt;Ethel M. Pope, [https://books.google.com/books?id=m6qpf9fPVg4C&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=Bell%20Gaspar%20Correa&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q=Bell%20Gaspar%20Correa&amp;f=false] "India in Portuguese literature", p. 69, Asian Educational Services, 1989, {{ISBN|81-206-0496-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered an indispensable contemporary reference, having profited from his thirty-five years' work in India, and from privileged sources unknown to [[Fernão Lopes de Castanheda]] or [[João de Barros]]. He wrote the first European account on Asiatic Cholera.&lt;ref&gt;Ethel M. Pope, India in Portuguese literature, p. 284, Asian Educational Services, 1989, {{ISBN|81-206-0496-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory suggests that he was murdered in [[Portuguese Malacca]], by order of Governor [[Estêvão da Gama (16th century)|Estêvão da Gama]], the son of [[Vasco da Gama]].

The 3,500-page ''Lendas da Índia'' manuscript was brought from India to Portugal by Miguel da Gama shortly after Correia's death and copies circulated only among authorised persons.  One author claims, without citing any source, that the manuscript was published in 12 volumes in 1556 but, if it existed, no trace remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lach|first=Donald F|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9TRfZ9IjygC|page=338|title=Asia in the Making of Europe, Volume I: The Century of Discovery|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family retained the manuscript of the original, which was printed in 1858 (first part) and 1864 (second part) by the [[Sciences Academy of Lisbon|Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon]].

He died around 1563 in Goa, Portuguese India.

'''Gertrude "Trudi" Duby Blom''' (born Gertrude Elisabeth Lörtscher; July 7, 1901 &amp;ndash; December 23, 1993)&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite linked authority file|id=n83-134641|accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Swiss [[journalist]], [[social anthropologist]], and [[Documentary photography|documentary photographer]] who spent five decades chronicling the Mayan cultures of [[Chiapas]], Mexico, particularly the culture of the [[Lacandon people|Lacandon]] Maya. In later life, she also became an environmental activist.  Blom's former home [[Casa Na Bolom]] is a research and cultural center devoted to the protection and preservation of the Lacandon Maya and La [[Selva Lacandona]] [[rain forest]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/29/obituaries/gertrude-blom-92-long-a-chronicler-of-mayan-cultures.html ''The New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe 1901-1940==
Gertrude Blom was born in the Swiss Alps, in the canton of [[Bern]], Switzerland.  She grew up in the village of Wimmis, where her father Otto Lörtscher was a minister and much of her childhood play was influenced by the wild west tales of [[Karl May]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Alex, and Margaret Sartor. ''Gertrude Blom Bearing Witness''. Chapel Hill and London: The University of North Carolina Press. 1984. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; After completing a [[horticulture]] degree in 1918, Blom attended a school for social work in Zurich.  There she became a member of the [[Socialist Party]] and developed an interest in journalism and politics.  She left school and traveled throughout Europe, speaking and organizing on behalf of the Socialist Party. In 1925 she married Kurt Düby (1900–1951). Her marriage ended a few years later when Blom moved to Germany to report on Adolf Hitler and growing Nazi brutality for Swiss newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Sartor&lt;/ref&gt;  Working as an anti-fascist organizer, speaker, and journalist led Blom to Paris, where she joined the international movement against Hitler's Germany. In 1939, after Blom was arrested and deported back to Switzerland, she planned to travel to New York and raise funds for war refugees, but a sudden change of heart led her to join the mass [[emigration]] of  pacifists, communists, labor leaders, artists and Jews welcomed to Mexico by President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Sartor&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico 1940-1969==
In Mexico City, Blom was hired as a government social worker to study and report on the working conditions of Mexican women. Later, while researching women who had fought as ''[[Liberation Army of the South|zapatistas]]'' with [[Emiliano Zapata]]'s revolutionary army, Blom bought her first camera to help document her work.  In 1943, influenced by the adventures of French anthropologist [[Jacques Soustelle]], whose book on jungle exploration she had read on the boat to Mexico, Blom convinced a government minister to let her join a [[Chiapas]] expedition going in search of the legendary and rarely photographed Lacandon Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Sartor&lt;/ref&gt;  Blom later credited her attractive appearance and the camera she wore around her neck for her place on this first official Lacandon expedition, which was to be conducted on horseback. Blom had never ridden a horse before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/harrisalex/ Harris, Alex.  Interview with Gertrude Blom, 1982. Recording.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did Blom become an expert horsewoman, photograph the Lacandon, and write a book about the 1943 expedition,&lt;ref&gt;Duby, Gertrude. ''Los Lacandones, Su Pasado y Su'' ''Presente''. Biblioteca Enciclopedica Popular. Mexico City, 1944. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; she found in the Lacandon Mayan people and their jungle home her life's [[avocation]].  Later that year, on a second expedition to visit another Lacandon settlement, she met [[Frans Blom]], a Danish archeologist and [[cartographer]] who was in the jungle searching for the Mayan ruin of [[Bonampak]]. They teamed up on several subsequent jungle explorations, which later provided the material for a two-volume study ''La Selva Lacandona.''&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Sartor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blom, Frans and Gertrude Duby. ''La Selva Lacandona''. Editorial Libros de Mexico. Mexico City, 1955-56. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1951, Frans and Gertrude Blom had married. To be closer to the jungle, they moved from Mexico City to [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]], Chiapas.  There, they bought a derelict [[monastery]] which they restored and named [[Casa Na Bolom]], or House of the Jaguar.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse, Robert L. ''Frans Blom, Maya Explorer''. University of New Mexico Press. Albuquerque 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; To support the household and Frans' Mayan studies, the Bloms took in paying guests for meals. Eventually, Casa Na Bolom evolved into an inn attracting visitors from all over the world, including archeologists from major American universities and guests as notable as [[Diego Rivera]], [[François Mitterrand]], [[Helen Hayes]], and [[Henry Kissinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Sartor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Blom&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next 12 years, until Frans Blom's death in 1963, the Bloms shared a passion for expeditions in search of Mayan ruins. On  these trips and sometimes as a paid jungle guide for others, Gertrude Blom continued photographing the Mayan people. She had little interest in the technical side of photography. Blom considered her camera a tool for documenting the people and culture of a rapidly changing place. Once a picture was taken, Blom often lost interest or forgot to develop prints.&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Sartor&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico 1970-1993==
In the early 1970s the direction of Blom's life changed yet again. She had become increasingly disturbed by the systematic deforestation of La Selva Lacandona by loggers, immigrant settlers, the petroleum industry, and the Mexican government. Blom decided she must speak out, and thus became one of the first environmental activists of the twentieth century.  On her own, she made lecture tours with slide shows of her documentary photographs, traveling in Mexico, the United States, Germany and Switzerland to raise awareness of the irreparable damage being done to the jungle. She wrote hundreds of articles in three different languages protesting Mexican policies. Blom appeared on Mexican television shows and lobbied Mexican government officials.  In 1975, within the grounds of Na Bolom, she started El Vivero, a tree nursery which has distributed thousands of free trees for [[reforestation]].  In her essay ''The Jungle is Burning'', Blom writes "If mankind continues abusing the planet as we are today, the effects in the near future will be far worse than the devastation that would be caused by any atomic bomb."&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Sartor&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Blom oversaw the first published collection of her photographs ''Gertrude Blom - Bearing Witness,'' a project sponsored by The Center for Documentary Studies, [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Sartor&lt;/ref&gt;   ''Reina de la Selva'', a film of Blom's life in which she appears, was made by Robert Cozens in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanrafaelfilms.com/aboutus.html San Rafael Films]&lt;/ref&gt;

Blom died at age 92. She was buried next to Frans Blom in the municipal cemetery of San Cristobal de Las Casas.  In 2011, the remains of Frans and Gertrude Blom were disinterred and transported to the jungle village of [[Naha, Chiapas]] where Blom had kept a jungle camp for many years. The Bloms were finally laid to rest according to their wishes, in La Selva Lacandona and near the grave of Chan K'in Viejo,&lt;ref&gt;Catchpole, Karen."A Final Resting Place (finally)." ''Trans-Americas Journey''. 5 June 2011. Accessed 16 June 2012. Blog.&lt;/ref&gt; a Lacandon spiritual leader whom Blom considered her best friend.&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Sartor&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guerra a muerte''' (lit. English: ''War to the death'') is a term coined by [[Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna]] and used in [[Chile]]an [[historiography]] to describe the irregular, [[no quarter|no-quarter]] warfare that broke out from 1819 to 1821 during the [[Chilean War of Independence]]. 

After the royalists had been expelled from all cities and ports north of the [[Bio-Bio River]], [[Vicente Benavides]] organized royalist resistance in [[La Frontera (geographical region)|La Frontera]] with the aid of [[Mapuche]] chiefs. The aid of the Mapuches was vital to the royalists since they had lost control of all cities and ports north of [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]]. Most Mapuches valued the treaties they had with the Spanish authorities, while many other Mapuches regarded the matter with indifference and played both sides against each other. The [[Pincheira brothers]], a future outlaw group, served Benavides in the ''Guerra a muerte'' by defending the Cordillera.

As result of the Guerra a muerte the government of nascent republic begun to distrust the [[Franciscan]] missionaries of [[Chillán]] who were regarded as representatives of the old regime. This led to the recruitment of a new contingent of missionaries for Chillán in the 1830s.&lt;ref name=JRP1993&gt;{{cite journal |title=Jesuitas, Franciscanos y Capuchinos italianos en la Araucanía (1600-1900) |journal=[[Revista Complutense de Historia de América]] |year=1993 | pages = 109–147 |volume=19 | issue =|accessdate=February 22, 2014 |last1=Pinto Rodríguez |first1=Jorge |authorlink=Jorge Pinto Rodríguez|url=http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/RCHA/article/viewFile/RCHA9393110109A/29307 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hemming''' (occasionally '''Heming''') was a monk, author and compiler in medieval England from around the time of the [[Norman conquest of England]]. He was a senior brother at [[Worcester Cathedral Priory]], and his significance derives from the monastic [[cartulary]] (and works therein) attributed to him.

Hemming's name is Scandinavian, which may mean either he or his ancestors were Scandinavians settled in England. His birth and death dates are unknown, but he was actively writing soon after the Conquest. Hemming became a [[sub-prior]] in the Worcester cathedral priory.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Mason "Hemming (fl. c.1095)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; He is named in both the ''Liber Vitae'' of [[Worcester Cathedral]] as well as a list of members of the cathedral chapter that was compiled during the episcopate of [[Samson (Bishop of Worcester)|Samson]], the bishop from 1096 to 1112.&lt;ref name=BASE/&gt;

Hemming was the eponymous author and compiler of a work usually called ''[[Hemming's Cartulary]]''. This is a collection of documents gathered together with a series of narratives about Worcester and its cathedral chapter.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; His compilation includes a life of [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]], the [[Bishop of Worcester]] who died in 1095. This life was written in Latin.&lt;ref name=Grandsen87&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing in England'' p. 87 and footnotes 157 and 158&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Antonia Gransden]] describes this work as "more like an inventory of charters in narrative form than a biography".&lt;ref name=Grandsen90&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing in England'' p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hemming has traditionally been credited with the entire work of the cartulary, it is actually two works that were collected together after Hemming completed his work. Hemming was the author of the second, later part, which was later bound together with an earlier cartulary to form the manuscript [[Cotton Tiberius A xiii]], one of the manuscripts in the [[Cotton Library]]. In part of the work, the preface known as the "Enucleatios libelli", Hemming names himself as the person responsible for compiling the work, and names Wulfstan as the inspiration for his work.&lt;ref name=BASE/&gt; Historians usually take the preface to mean that Wulfstan commissioned the work.&lt;ref name=Feudal35&gt;Barlow ''Feudal Kingdom of England'' p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams145&gt;Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The cartulary is not just a collection of deeds and charters, but includes other historical information of importance, especially for his monastery.&lt;ref name=BASE/&gt; He compiled the various documents into a narrative whole.&lt;ref name=Houts110/&gt;

One of the themes of Hemming's work is the deprivations suffered by his monastery at the hands of royal officials. Hemming singled out the conquests of England by [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] and [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] as being especially damaging.&lt;ref name=Uni22&gt;Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Simon Keynes]] calls Hemming the "historian of his house".&lt;ref name=BASE&gt;Keynes "Hemming" ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 231–232&lt;/ref&gt; Hemming, according to the historian V. H. Galbraith, might be considered the first [[archivist]] in English history, as he arranged to have the documents at Worcester stored under locks, and spent time repairing and restoring some of the original documents in the cathedral.&lt;ref name=Clanchy158&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemming was a contemporary of two other Worcester monks who wrote historical works. One was Coleman, who wrote a now lost ''Life of Wulfstan'' that was used as a source by [[William of Malmesbury]].&lt;ref name=Houts110&gt;van Houts "Historical Writing" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Another was [[John of Worcester]], who reworked the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' into a ''Chronicon ex chronicis''.&lt;ref name=Houts112&gt;van Houts "Historical Writing" ''Companion to Anglo-Norman England'' pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the correct form of the name is "Hemming", a transcription error in the 18th century caused many 18th- and 19th-century historians to use the one-m form of the name, until it was corrected in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' article on Hemming in 1891.&lt;ref name=Ker49&gt;Ker "Hemming's Cartulary" ''Studies in Medieval History'' p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ibn Wahshiyyah the Nabataean''' ({{lang-ar|ابن وحشية النبطي}}), also known as ʾAbū Bakr ʾAḥmad bin ʿAlī  ({{lang-ar|أبو بكر أحمد بن علي}}) (fl. 9th/10th centuries) was an Arab [[alchemist]], [[agriculturalist]], farm [[toxicologist]],&lt;ref name="toxicologist" /&gt; [[Egyptologist]],&lt;ref&gt;El-Daly, Okasha (2005).

==Works==
[[Ibn al-Nadim]] (in ''Kitab al-Fihrist'') lists a large number of books on [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], statues, offerings, agriculture, [[alchemy]], [[physics]] and medicine, that were either written, or translated from older books, by Ibn Wahshiyya.&lt;ref&gt;"First, the books of the Nabatean corpus themselves claim to be translations from "ancient Syriac" (e.g. Filaha 1:5) made by Ibn Wahshiyya" (Hämeen-Anttila, Jaako (2006).

===The ''Nabataean Agriculture''===
{{see also|Muslim Agricultural Revolution}}

{{quote|In agriculture, the ''Filahât al-Nabâtiyyah'' (Nabataean Agriculture) of Ibn Wahshiyya  is the most influential of all Muslim works on the subject. Written in the third/ninth century and drawn mostly from Chaldaean and Babylonian sources, the book deals not only with agriculture but also with the esoteric sciences, especially magic and sorcery, and has always been considered to be one of the important books in Arabic on the occult sciences.|[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr|S.H. Nasr]]&lt;ref&gt;"''Natural History''" by [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr|S.H. Nasr]] in ''A History of Muslim Philosophy'', edited and introduced by M.M. Sharif (1966), volume II, p. 1323&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ibn Wahshiyya translated from [[Nabataean Arabic|Nabataean]] the ''Nabataean Agriculture'' (''Kitab al-falaha al-nabatiya''; c. 904), a major treatise on the subject, which was said to be based on ancient [[Babylonia]]n sources.&lt;ref&gt;Jaakko Hämeen-Anttila ''Ideology'' 2002, ''Nabataean Agriculture'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The book extols Babylonian [[civilization]] against that of the conquering [[Arabs]]. It contains valuable information on agriculture and superstitions, and in particular discusses beliefs attributed to the [[Sabians]] - understood as people who lived [[Pre-Adamite|before Adam]] - that [[Adam]] had parents and that he came from [[History of India|India]]. These ideas were discussed by the Jewish philosophers [[Yehuda Halevi]] and [[Maimonides]], through which they became an influence on the seventeenth century French [[Millenarian]] [[Isaac La Peyrère]].

====Toxicology====
He wrote a toxicology treatise, the ''Book of Poisons'', combining contemporary science, magic and astrology.&lt;ref name="toxicologist"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iovdijová|first=A|author2=Bencko, V|title=Potential risk of exposure to selected xenobiotic residues and their fate in the food chain--part I: classification of xenobiotics|journal=Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine|year=2010|volume=17|issue=2|pages=183–92|pmid=21186759|url=http://www.aaem.pl/pdf/17183.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptology===
Ibn Wahshiyya was one of the first historians to be able to at least partly decipher what was written in the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs,&lt;ref name="Daly1"/&gt; by relating them to the contemporary [[Coptic language]] used by [[Copt]]ic priests in his time. An Arabic manuscript of Ibn Wahshiyya's book ''Kitab Shawq al-Mustaham'', a work that discusses a number of ancient alphabets, in which he deciphered a number of Egyptian hieroglyphs, was later read by [[Athanasius Kircher]] in the 17th century, and then translated and published in [[English language|English]] by [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]] in 1806 as ''Ancient Alphabets and Hieroglyphic Characters Explained; with an Account of the Egyptian Priests, their Classes, Initiation, and Sacrifices in the Arabic Language by Ahmad Bin Abubekr Bin Wahishih'', 16 years before [[Jean-François Champollion]]'s complete decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs.&lt;ref name=Daly2&gt;Dr. Okasha El Daly, [http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=712 Deciphering Egyptian Hieroglyphs in Muslim Heritage], [[Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientalphabet00conggoog|title=Ancient Alphabets and Hieroglyphic Characters Explained: With an Account of ... : Aḥmad ibn ʻAlī Ibn Waḥshīyah, Ahmed ibn 'Ali ibn al Mukhtar ibn 'Abd al Karim, Joseph Hammer-Purgstall , Pforzheimer Bruce Rogers Collection (Library of Congress) : Free Download &amp;amp; Streaming : Internet Archive|publisher=archive.org|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book was known to [[Silvestre de Sacy]], a colleague of Champollion. Dr [[Okasha El Daly]], at [[University College London]]'s Institute of Archaeology, claims that some hieroglyphs had been decoded by Ibn Wahshiyya, eight centuries before Champollion deciphered the [[Rosetta stone]].&lt;ref name=Observer&gt;{{cite news |first=Robin |last=McKie |title=Arab scholar 'cracked Rosetta code' 800 years before the West |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1318435,00.html |work=The Observer |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited 2007 |date=2004-10-03 |accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A. K. Eyma critiques this idea and think that "there was no such thing as an Arabic decipherment of hieroglyphs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.egyptologyforum.org/reviews/Missing1000.html|title=egyptologyforum.org|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), page 305&lt;/ref&gt; and numbered by the scholars of [[Hellenistic]] [[Alexandria]] in the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] list of [[nine lyric poets]]. He was mainly remembered in antiquity for [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic]] verses, but he also composed lyrical narratives on mythological themes in the manner of [[Stesichorus]].&lt;ref name="David A. Campbell 1991 page 8"&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 8&lt;/ref&gt; His work survives today only as quotations by ancient scholars or recorded on fragments of papyrus recovered from archaeological sites in Egypt, yet his extant verses include what are considered some of the finest examples of Greek poetry.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), page 306, referring to fragments 286 and 287&lt;/ref&gt; The following lines, dedicated to a lover, Euryalus, were recorded by [[Athenaeus]] as a famous example of amorous praise:

:::{{lang|grc|Εὐρύαλε Γλαυκέων Χαρίτων θάλος, Ὡρᾶν}}
:::{{lang|grc|καλλικόμων μελέδημα, σὲ μὲν Κύπρις}}
:::{{lang|grc|ἅ τ' ἀγανοβλέφαρος Πει-}}
:::{{lang|grc|θὼ ῥοδέοισιν ἐν θρέψαν.}}

The rich language of these lines, in particular the accumulation of epithets, typical of Ibycus, is shown in the following translation: 
:::Euryalus, offshoot of the blue-eyed [[Graces]], darling of the lovely-haired [[Horae|Seasons]], the [[Aphrodite|Cyprian]] and soft-lidded [[Peitho|Persuasion]] nursed you among rose-blossoms.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment 288, cited and translated by David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 256-7&lt;/ref&gt;
This mythological account of his lover recalls [[Hesiod]]'s account of [[Pandora]],&lt;ref&gt;''Op.'' lines 73–100, especially:

Gerber, ''A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets'', Brill (1997), page 196&lt;/ref&gt;

As is the case with many other major poets of ancient Greece, Ibycus became famous not just for his poetry but also for events in his life, largely the stuff of legend: the testimonia are difficult to interpret and very few biographical facts are actually known.&lt;ref name="David A. Campbell 1991 page 8"/&gt;

==Life==
The [[Byzantium under the Macedonians|Byzantine]] encyclopaedia [[Suda]] represents a good example of a problematic biography, here translated by David Campbell:
{{Quotation|'''Ibycus''': son of Phytius; but some say son of the historian Polyzelus of Messana, others son of Cerdas; of Rhegium by birth. From there he went to Samos when it was ruled by the father of the tyrant Polycrates. This was in the time of [[Croesus]], in the 54th Olympiad (564–60 BC). He was completely crazed with love for boys, and he was the inventor of the so-called ''sambyke'', a kind of triangular [[cithara]]. His works are in seven books in the Doric dialect. Captured by bandits in a deserted place he declared that the cranes which happened to be flying overhead would be his avengers; he was murdered, but afterwards one of the bandits saw some cranes in the city and exclaimed, "Look, the avengers of Ibycus!" Someone overheard and followed up his words: the crime was confessed and the bandits paid the penalty; whence the proverbial expression, "the cranes of Ibycus".&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), pages 209-11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Suda's chronology has been dismissed as "muddled" since it makes Ibycus about a generation older than [[Anacreon]], another poet known to have flourished at the court of Polycrates, and it is inconsistent with what we know of the Samian tyrant from [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus 3.39, cited by C.M.Bowra, ''Greek Lyric Poetry from Alcman to Simonides'', Oxford University Press (1961, reprinted 2000), page 248&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]] recorded the poet's first experience of fame ("agnoscitur") somewhere between 542 and 537 BC&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 211, note 2:''the given range of dates reflects differences between manuscripts''&lt;/ref&gt; and this better fits the period of Polycrates' reign. Suda's account seems to be corroborated by a papyrus fragment (''P.Oxy.''1790), usually ascribed to Ibycus, glorifying a youthful Polycrates, but this was unlikely to have been '''the''' Polycrates of Samos and might instead have been his son, mentioned in a different context by [[Himerius]] as Polycrates, governor of Rhodes.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas E. Gerber, ''A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets'', Brill (1997), page 188, referring to Himerus ''Or.'' 29.22 ff. Colonna&lt;/ref&gt; Suda's list of fathers of Ibycus also presents problems:&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 208, notes 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; there were no historians in the early 6th century and ''Cerdas'' looks like an invention of the comic stage (it has low associations). There was a [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] lawgiver of Rhegium known as Phytius, but the early 6th century is too early for this candidate also. Ibycus gives no indication of being a Pythagorean himself, except in one poem he identifies the Morning Star with the Evening Star, an identity first popularized by Pythagoras.&lt;ref&gt;Scholiast on Basil, ''Genesis'', cited by David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Bowra, ''Greek Lyric Poetry from Alcman to Simonides'', Oxford University Press (1961, reprinted 2000), page 241&lt;/ref&gt; Suda's extraordinary account of the poet's death is found in other sources, such as [[Plutarch]]&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De Garrulitate'' 14 ([[Stephanus pagination|Steph.]] 509 E-F)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Antipater of Sidon]]&lt;ref&gt;''Palatine Anthology 7.745: Antipater of Sidon xix Gow-Page&lt;/ref&gt; and later it inspired [[Friedrich Schiller]] to write a ballad called "The Cranes of Ibycus"&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, David David A. ''Greek Lyric Poetry.'' MacMillan 1967, p. 305 - 306.&lt;/ref&gt; yet the legend might be derived merely from a play upon the poet's name and the Greek word for the bird {{lang|grc|ἶβυξ}} or ''ibyx''—it might even have been told of somebody else originally.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 211, note 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;However, according to [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] ([[Sub_voce#sub_verbo|s.v.]] ''[[iota]]'' 138) {{lang|grc|ἶβυξ}} is a form of [[ibis]], while the common Greek word for "[[crane (bird)|crane]]" ({{lang|grc|γέρανος}}, ''geranos'') is used of the birds associated with the death of Ibycus&lt;/ref&gt; Another proverb associated with Ibycus was recorded by [[Diogenianus]]: "more antiquated than Ibycus" or "more silly than Ibycus". The proverb was apparently based on an anecdote about Ibycus stupidly or nobly turning down an opportunity to become tyrant of Rhegium in order to pursue a poetic career instead&lt;ref&gt;Diogen.2.71, cited by David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 213&lt;/ref&gt; (one modern scholar however infers from his poetry that Ibycus was in fact '''wise''' enough to avoid the lure of supreme power, citing as an example Plato's quotation from one of his lyrics: "I am afraid it may be in exchange for some sin before the gods that I get honour from men")&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]] (242D), cited by C.M.Bowra, ''Greek Lyric Poetry from Alcman to Simonides'', Oxford University Press (1961, reprinted 2000), page 245&lt;/ref&gt; There is no other information about Ibycus' activities in the West, apart from an account by Himerius, that he fell from his chariot while travelling between [[Catana]] and [[Himera]] and injured his hand badly enough to give up playing the lyre "for some considerable time."&lt;ref&gt;Himer.''Or.''69.35, cited by David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 291&lt;/ref&gt;  

Some modern scholars have found in the surviving poetry evidence that Ibycus might have spent time at [[Sicyon]] before journeying to Samos—mythological references indicate local knowledge of Sicyon and could even point to the town's alliance with [[Sparta]] against [[Argos]] and Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas E. Gerber, ''A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets'', Brill (1997), page 189&lt;/ref&gt; His depiction of the women of Sparta as "thigh-showing" (quoted by Plutarch as proof of lax morals among the women there) is vivid enough to suggest that he might have composed some verses in Sparta also.&lt;ref&gt;Plut.''comp.Lyc. et Num.'', cited by David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 289; see also comment page 7&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that he left Samos at the same time as Anacreon, on the death of Polycrates, and there is an anonymous poem in the [[Palatine Anthology]] celebrating Rhegium as his final resting place, describing a tomb located under an elm, covered in ivy and white reeds.&lt;ref&gt;''Anth.Pal.''7.714, cited by David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 215&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
Ibycus' role in the development of Greek lyric poetry was as a mediator between eastern and western styles: 
{{quotation|[[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] wrote while [[Stesichorus]] was developing the different art of the choral ode in the West. They owed nothing to him, and he owed nothing to them. But soon afterwards the art of the West was brought to [[Ionia]], and the fusion of the two styles marked a new stage in Greek poetry. For Stesichorus left a disciple, who began by writing in the master's manner and then turned to other purposes and made his poetry the vehicle for his own private, or public, emotions. — [[Cecil Maurice Bowra]]&lt;ref name="C.M.Bowra, 1961, page 241"&gt;C.M.Bowra, ''Greek Lyric Poetry from Alcman to Simonides'', Oxford University Press (1961, reprint 2000), page 241&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Although scholars like Bowra have concluded that his style must have changed with his setting, such a neat distinction is actually hard to prove from the existing verses, which are an intricate blend of
the public, "choral" style of Stesichorus, and the private, "soloist" style of the Lesbian poets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Hutchinson (academic)|G. O. Hutchinson]], ''Greek Lyric Poetry: a commentary on selected larger pieces'', Oxford University Press (2001), page 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D.A.Campbell, 1991 page 7"&gt;D.A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 7&lt;/ref&gt; It is not certain that he ever in fact composed monody (lyrics for solo performance), but the emotional and erotic quality of his verse, and the fact that his colleague in Samos was Anacreon, who did compose monody, suggest that Ibycus did too.&lt;ref&gt;D.A.Campbell, "Monody", in P.Easterling and B.Knox (ed.s), ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 214&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some modern scholars believe that 'choral' lyrics were actually performed by soloists and therefore maybe all Ibycus' work was monody.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Nagy, ''Greek Literature Vol.7: Greek Literature in the Hellenistic Period'', Routledge (2001), page 287&lt;/ref&gt; He modelled his work on the "choral" lyrics of Stesichorus at least in so far as he wrote narratives on mythical themes (often with original variations from the traditional stories) and structured his verses in triads (units of three stanzas each, called "strophe", "antistrophe" and "epode"), so closely in fact that even the ancients sometimes had difficulty distinguishing between the two poets&lt;ref&gt;D.A.Cambell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), page 305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Cambell elsewhere (''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb, page 63) cites this comment by Athenaeus (4.172de): "but Stesichorus or Ibycus had previously said in a poem entitled ''Funeral Games''&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas however ancient scholars collected the work of Stesichorus into twenty-six books, each probably a self-contained narrative that gave its title to the whole book,&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), page 254&lt;/ref&gt; they compiled only seven books for Ibycus, which were numbered rather than titled and whose selection criteria are unknown.&lt;ref name="D.A.Campbell, 1991 page 7"/&gt; Recent papyrus finds suggest also that Ibycus might have been the first to compose 'choral' [[Epinikion|victory odes]] (an innovation usually credited to [[Simonides]]).&lt;ref&gt;D.A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), pages 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Cambell cites P.Oxy.2637 and  finds also a [[pindar]]ic/epinikion tone in a quote from [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (''comment. in Ptolem. harmon.'' iv):"with the gluttonous mouth of Strife will one day arm for battle against me."; translated by Cambell, Loeb III, page 271&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1920s, all that survived of Ibycus' work were two large-ish fragments (one seven, the other thirteen lines long) and about fifty other lines scraped together from a variety of ancient commentaries. Since then, papyrus finds have greatly added to the store of Ibycean verses - notably, and controversially, forty-eight continuous lines addressed to Polycrates, whose identification with Polycrates of Rhodes (son of Polycrates, the Samian tyrant) requires a careful selection of historical sources.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Barron, 'Ibycus:Gorgias and other poems', ''Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies'' Vol.31 Issue 1 (Dec. 1984), pages 13-24, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-5370.1984.tb00526.x/abstract online here]&lt;/ref&gt; Authorship of the poem is attributed to Ibycus on textual and historical grounds but its quality as verse is open to debate: "insipid", "inept and slovenly"&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell,  ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), pages 306-7&lt;/ref&gt; or, more gently, "not an unqualified success"&lt;ref name="C.M.Bowra, 1961, page 241"/&gt; and optimally "the work of a poet realizing a new vision, with a great command of epic material which he could manipulate for encomiastic effect."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas E. Gerber, citing opinions of Barron (1969) and Sisti (1967), ''A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets'', Brill (1997), page 191&lt;/ref&gt;  In the poem, Ibycos parades the names and characteristics of heroes familiar from Homer's Trojan epic, as types of people the poem is '''not''' about, until he reaches the final stanza, where he reveals that his real subject is Polycrates, whom he says he will immortalize in verse. An elaborate and not very amusing joke, this "puzzling" poem has been considered historically significant by some scholars as a signal from Ibycus that he is now turning his back on epic themes to concentrate on love poetry instead: a new vision or ''recusatio''.&lt;ref&gt;D.A.Campbell, 'Monody', P.Easterling and B.Knox (ed.s), ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 216&lt;/ref&gt;    

He composed like Stesichorus in a literary language, largely [[Epic Greek|Epic]] with some [[Doric Greek|Doric]] flavouring, and with a few [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolisms]] that he borrowed from the love poetry of Sappho and Alcaeus.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell,  ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), pages 307&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible however that the Doric dialect was added by editors in Hellenistic and Roman times, when the poet's home town, Rhegium, had become more Doric than it had been in the poet's own time.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Ucciardello, 'Sulla tradizione del testo di Ibico' in 'Lirica e Teatro in Grecia: Il Testo e la sua ricezione—Atti del 11 incontro di Studi, Perugia, 23-24 gennaio 2003', ''Edizioni Scientifiche Italiane'' (2005), pages 21-88. See English summary online in [http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2006/2006-08-56.html Bryn Mawr Classical Review]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this "superficial element of Doric dialect", the style of Ibycus features mainly dactylic rhythms (reflecting the Epic traditions he shared with Stesichorus), a love theme and accumulated epithets.&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Bowra, ''Greek Lyric Poetry from Alcman to Simonides'', Oxford University Press (1961, reprint 2000), page 250&lt;/ref&gt; His use of imagery can seem chaotic but it is justified as an artistic effect.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Davies, 'Symbolism and Imagery in the Poetry of Ibycus', ''Hermes'' Vol.114, No.4 (4th Qtr 1986), pages 399-405,  [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4476524 online here]&lt;/ref&gt; His style has been described by one modern scholar as "graceful and passionate." &lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Herbert Weir, ''Greek Melic Poets'' Biblo and Tannen, 1963, page 271&lt;/ref&gt; The ancients sometimes considered his work with distaste as a lecherous and corrupting influence&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;D.A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb (1991) page 8: "His love poetry was what later generations particularly remembered, sometimes with distaste", citing as proof [[Philodemus]] and [[Cicero]], translated on page 217:
#Philodemus ''On Music'', here commenting on the arguments of the Stoic [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]]: "And he did not show that Ibycus, Anacreon and the like corrupted young men by their melodies but rather by their ideas."
#Cicero''Tusc.'' 4.33: "Finally, what revelations do the greatest scholars and finest poets make about themselves in their poems and songs? Alcaeus was recognised as a valiant hero in his city, but look at what he writes about love for youths! Anacreon's poetry of course is all erotic. More than any of them Ibycus of Rhegium was ablaze with love, as his writings demonstrate. And we see that the love of all these is lustful."&lt;/ref&gt; but they also responded sympathetically to the pathos he sought to evoke—his account of [[Menelaus]]'s failure to kill [[Helen of Troy]], under the spell of her beauty, was valued by ancient critics above [[Eurypides]]'s account of the same story in his play [[Andromache (play)|Andromache]].&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Bowra, ''Greek Lyric Poetry from Alcman to Simonides'', Oxford University Press (1961, reprint 2000), page 244&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fragment 286===
The following poem was quoted by the ancient scholar Athenaeus in his wide-ranging discourses [[Deipnosophistae|''Scholars at Dinner'']] and it demonstrates some of the characteristics of Ibycean verse:
:::In spring the [[Kydonia]]n
:::apple trees, watered by flowing
:::streams there where the [[Nymphs|Maidens]]
:::have their unravished garden, and vine buds,
:::growing under the shadowy branches
:::of the vines, bloom and flourish. For me, however, love
:::is at rest in no season
:::but like the [[Thrace|Thracian]] [[Etesian|north wind]],
:::ablaze with lightning,
:::rushing from [[Aphrodite]] with scorching
:::fits of madness, dark and unrestrained,
:::it forcibly convulses from their very roots
:::my mind and heart.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew M.Miller (translator), ''Greek Lyric: an anthology in translation'', Hackett Publishing Company Inc. (1996), page 97&lt;/ref&gt;
The poem establishes a contrast between the tranquility of nature and the ever restless impulses to which the poet's desires subject him, while the images and epithets accumulate almost chaotically, communicating a sense of his inner turmoil. In the original Greek, initial tranquility is communicated by repeated vowel sounds in the first six lines.&lt;ref&gt;D.A.Campbell, 'Monody', P.Easterling and B.Knox (ed.s), ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 215&lt;/ref&gt; His love of nature and his ability to describe it in lively images are reminiscent of Sappho's work.&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Bowra, ''Greek Lyric Poetry from Alcman to Simonides'', Oxford University Press (1961, reprint 2000), page 265&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
*In book four of [[Apollonius Rhodius]]'s ''[[Argonautica]]'', the goddess Hera reveals that [[Achilles]] is destined to marry [[Medea]] in the Elysian Fields (''Argonautica'' 4.811–15). A [[scholiast]] on the passage comments that this account was first put forward by Ibycus, and that it was also taken up by [[Simonides of Ceos]]. In another scholium, it is said that the Argonautica's account of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]'s abduction by an amorous Zeus (''Argonautica'' 3.114–17) was also modelled on a version by Ibycus (in Homer's earlier account, Zeus abducted the youth to be his wine-pourer: ''Iliad'' 20.234), and that Ibycus, moreover, described the abduction of [[Tithonus]] by Dawn ([[Eos]]).&lt;ref&gt;fr. 289 and 291, D. Cambell, ''Greek Lyric'' III, Loeb Classical Library (1991) page 259&lt;/ref&gt; Apollonius Rhodius represented Eros as a child of Aphrodite (''Argonautica'' 3.25–6) and there is a relevant scholium on that passage too, according to which [[Sappho]] made Eros the son of Earth and Heaven, Simonides made him the son of Aphrodite and Ares, and Ibycus made him the son of&amp;nbsp;...? The section is lost, but it has been suggested that he made Eros the son of Aphrodite and [[Hephaestus]]&lt;ref&gt;fr. 324, D. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric'' III, Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 279&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anti-Semitism}}
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
A '''Jewish quota''' was a [[racial quota]] limiting the number of [[Jew]]s in various establishments to a certain percentage. In particular, in the 19th and 20th centuries, some countries had Jewish quotas in [[higher education]].

Jewish [[educational quotas]] could be statewide law or adopted only in certain institutions, often unofficially. The limitation took the form of total prohibition of Jewish students, or of limiting the number of Jewish students so that their share in the students' population would not be larger than their share in the general population.{{why|date=May 2018}} In some establishments, the Jewish quota placed a limit on growth rather than set a fixed level of participation to be achieved.

Jews who wanted an education used various ways to overcome this discrimination: bribing the authorities, changing their religion, or traveling to countries without such limitations. In Hungary, for example, 5,000 Jewish youngsters (including [[Edward Teller]]) left the country after the introduction of ''[[numerus clausus]]''.

==Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students==
* [[Canada]]: Certain universities, notably [[McGill University]], [[Université de Montréal]] and the [[University of Toronto]], had longstanding quotas on the number of Jews admitted to the respective universities. [[McGill University]]'s strict quota was the longest, being officially adopted in 1920 up until the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews: A People's Journey'', (Toronto: University of Toronto Press), 2008, p. 132-133, 319-321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Germany]]: On 25 April 1933, the [[Nazi]] government introduced a 1.5 percent quota for new admissions of German Non-[[Aryan race|Aryans]]—i.e. essentially of German Jews—as core issue of a law claiming to generally limit the number of (Aryan and non-Aryan) students admitted to high-schools (''höhere Schulen'') and universities. In addition, high-schools and universities deemed to have more students than required for the professions for which they were training their students were required to reduce their student enrollment; doing so, they had to reach a maximum of 5 per cent of German non-Aryan students. The law was supposedly enacted to avoid overcrowding schools and universities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19330004&amp;zoom=2&amp;seite=00000225&amp;ues=0&amp;x=9&amp;y=13 Gesetz gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (RGBl 1933 I, S. 225)] (original German text of the ''Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities'', introduced in 1933)
[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19330004&amp;seite=00000226&amp;zoom=2 Erste Verordnung zur Durchführung des Gesetzes gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (RGBl 1933 I, S. 226)] (original German text of the ''First Regulation for the Implementation of the Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities'', introduced in 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; which referred to German concerns at the time that large numbers of students would decrease the quality of higher education. At the beginning of 1933, about 0.76 percent of the German population was Jewish, but more than 3.6 percent of German university students were Jewish, this number having steadily declined from over 9 percent in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/40185665 Claudia Huerkamp (1993). Jüdische Akademikerinnen in Deutschland 1900–1938 (= Jewish academics in Germany 1900–1938). ''Geschichte und Gesellschaft, 19. Jg. (Heft 3),'' Rassenpolitik und Geschlechterpolitik im Nationalsozialismus, pp. 311–331.] Publisher: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht (GmbH &amp; Co. KG)&lt;/ref&gt; After 30 July 1939, Jews were no longer permitted to attend German public schools at all, and the prior quota law was eliminated by a non-public regulation in January 1940.&lt;ref name="Olenhusen"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/30196241 A. G. v. Olenhusen: Die "nichtarischen" Studenten an den deutschen Hochschulen (= The non-Aryan students at German universities). ''Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte, 14(1966),'' pp. 175–206.] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;193&lt;/sup&gt;

: Apart from their strong and predominant anti-Semitic agenda, the law and its subsequent regulations were temporarily indeed used to limit general university access, i.e. including "non-Aryans" (Jews), as the name of the law implied. Starting 1934, a regulation limited the overall numbers of students admitted to German universities, and a special quota was introduced reducing women's admissions to a maximum of 10 percent. Although the limits were not entirely enforced—women's quota stayed a bit above 10 percent mainly because a smaller percentage of men than women accepted their university admissions—they made it for women approximately twice as hard to enter a university career than for men with the same qualification.&lt;ref name="Bildungsbürgerinnen"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QVToe3288bEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%C3%BCberfremdung&amp;f=false Claudia Huerkamp (1996). ''Bildungsbürgerinnen. Frauen im Studium und in akademischen Berufen 1900-1945.'' (Reihe: ''Bürgertum, Band 10'')] {{ISBN|3-525-35675-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;S.&amp;nbsp;80ff.&lt;/sup&gt; After two semesters, the admission limits were revoked, however, leaving in place the non-Aryan regulations.&lt;ref name="Olenhusen"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;178&lt;/sup&gt;
:''For additional information in German, see the [[:de:Gesetz gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen|article at the German Wikipedia]]''
* [[Hungary]]: a ''Numerus Clausus'' Act was introduced in 1920, under the government of [[Pál Teleki]]. It was said that the ethnic rate of students must meet the ethnic rate of population. Limitations were relaxed in 1928. Racial criteria in admitting new students were removed and replaced by social criteria. Five categories were set up: civil servants, war veterans and army officers, small landowners and artisans, industrialists, and the merchant classes.&lt;ref&gt;See: [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_14969.html Numerus Clausus]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Imperial Russia]] and [[Soviet Union]]: ''Numerus Clausus'' was enacted in 1887, stating that the share of Jewish students should be no more than 10 percent in cities where [[Jew]]s were [[Pale of Settlement|allowed to live]], 5 percent in other cities, and only 3 percent in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. These limitations were removed in the spring of 1917 after the tsar's abdication during the early phase of the Russian revolution of 1917-1918 (the so-called [[February Revolution]] of 1917); later, in the late 1940s during the initial phase of the [[Cold War]] and the tide of the anti-"[[rootless cosmopolitan]]" campaign a [[de facto]] gross discrimination of Jewish applicants was reintroduced in many institutions of higher education in the [[Soviet Union]] until [[Perestroika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[Mikhail Shifman]] |title=You Failed Your Math Test, Comrade Einstein: Adventures and Misadventures of Young Mathematicians Or Test Your Skills in Almost Recreational Mathematics |publisher=World Scientific |date=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ho6fMF8ehogC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Edward Frenkel]] |title=The Fifth problem: math &amp; anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union |date=October 2012 |journal=The New Criterion |url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-Fifth-problem--math---anti-Semitism-in-the-Soviet-Union-7446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-more-migrants-please-especially-the-clever-ones-2368622.html |location=London |work=[[The Independent]] |date=October 11, 2011 |title=More migrants please, especially the clever ones|author=[[Dominic Lawson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Andre Geim]] |title=Biographical |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=2010 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/geim-bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Poland]]: see [[Numerus clausus#Poland|Numerus clausus in Poland]] and [[Ghetto benches]].
* [[Romania]] ''Numerus Clausus'' was not introduced by law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hist-chron.com/judentum-aktenlage/numerus-clausus/EncJud_num-claus-d/EncJud_numerus-clausus-band12-kolonne-1267-1268.gif |title=Encyclopaedia Judaica: Numerus clausus, vol. 12, col. 1267-1268}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was adopted by students in the universities Cluj, Bucharest, Iasi and Cernauti.
* [[United States]]: Certain private universities, most notably [[Harvard]], introduced policies which effectively placed a quota on the number of Jews admitted to the university. According to historian [[David Oshinsky]], on writing about [[Jonas Salk]], "Most of the surrounding medical schools ([[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], and [[Yale University|Yale]]) had rigid quotas in place. In 1935 Yale accepted 76 applicants from a pool of 501. About 200 of those applicants were Jewish and only five got in." He notes that Dean Milton Winternitz's instructions were remarkably precise: "Never admit more than five Jews, take only two Italian Catholics, and take no blacks at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard N. Burrow|title=A History of Yale's School of Medicine: Passing Torches to Others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzYX_MduAG8C&amp;pg=PA107|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|page=107ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Oshinsky added, "[[Jonas Salk]] and hundreds like him" enrolled in [[New York University]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Oshinsky, David M.

Feynman]] was turned away from [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] in the 1930s and went to [[MIT]] instead. See also [[Numerus clausus#United States|Numerus clausus in the United States]].
* [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]: In 1940, the Yugoslav government enacted the Decree on the Enrollment of Persons of Jewish Descent at the University, Secondary School, Teacher Training College and Other Vocational Schools which limited the proportion of Jewish students to the proportion of Jews in the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ceu.hu/jewishstudies/pdf/02_goldstein.pdf |title=The Jews in Yugoslavia 1918-1941: Antisemitism and the Struggle for Equality |last=Goldstein |first=Ivo |authorlink=Ivo Goldstein |pages=10–11 |format=PDF |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Erzbischof Abert Bamberg JS.jpg|thumb|Friedrich Philipp von Abert]]

Abert was born in 1879 in Würzburg. His uncle was the [[Roman Catholic]] Archbishop of [[Bamberg]], [[Friedrich Philipp von Abert]]. In 1898 he passed his final exams, and studied history in Würzburg and [[Munich]]. In 1904 he received a Ph.D. in history. His thesis was published in 1905 as ''Die Wahlkapitulationen der Würzburger Bischöfe bis zum Ende des XVII. Jahrhunderts, 1225-1698''.&lt;ref&gt;Open Library: [http://openlibrary.org/b/OL21851863M/Wahlkapitulationen_der_Wu%CC%88rzburger_Bischo%CC%88fe_bis_zum_Ende_des_XVII._Jahrhunderts_1225-1698 ''Die Wahlkapitulationen...'' (Würzburg University Press, 1905)]&lt;/ref&gt; His career as an archivist began as an intern at the General State Archives in Munich in 1904. From 1908 to 1910 he was employed by the Archive of the noble family of Schönborn.

Abert served as a lieutenant in [[World War I]]. As a member of the [[Freikorps]] "[[Franz Xaver Ritter von Epp]]" he was involved in the suppression of the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]. From 1919 to 1926 he was head of the archives of the city of Würzburg and appointed afterwards Head of the State Archives in Würzburg. In 1928 he became an honorary professor.

Joseph Friedrich Abert lived together with [[Albrecht Becker]] (1906-2002) a production designer, photographer, and actor.

During the Nazi era, they were arrested for violating [[Paragraph 175|Section 175]], the legal ban on [[homosexuality]] and imprisoned. Abert lost his membership in the SA and Nazi Party and the privileges as a public servant. Later, he lived for a while in [[Rome]], where he worked at the [[German Historical Institute]] of the [[Repertorium Germanicum]]. In 1945 he returned to Würzburg, where he died on 25 October 1959.

In the exhibition of the [[Imperial War Museum]] in [[London]] on the [[Holocaust]] the fate of Joseph Friedrich Abert and his friend Albrecht Becker is shown as an example of Nazi-persecution of homosexuals.

He was also a headmaster in [[Tromsø]], and a politician for the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] who served as mayor of Tromsø and as [[Minister of Education and Research (Norway)|Minister of Education and Church Affairs]].

==Personal life==
He was born in [[Lyngseidet]] as a son of district physician Engebret Qvigstad (1814–1869) and Petra Krogh Wadel (1828–1905). In August 1885 in [[Hammerfest]] he married Margrethe Antonette Aagaard (1859–1949).&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Just Qvigstad|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Einar|last=Niemi|authorlink=Einar Niemi|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Just_Qvigstad/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son [[Just Knut Qvigstad]] was a notable engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1973|title=Qvigstad, Just Knut|encyclopedia=[[Hvem er hvem?]]|editor=Steenstrup, Bjørn|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|url=http://runeberg.org/hvemerhvem/1973/0449.html|pages=449–350|language=Norwegian|accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a brother-in-law of [[Arnfinn Palmstrøm]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Career in education and politics==
He was homeschooled until the age of ten, when he moved to [[Tromsø]] where he took the [[examen artium]] in 1869. He enrolled in philology studies at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] in 1870 and graduated with the [[cand.philol.]] degree in 1874. He was a teacher in [[Oslo|Christiania]] from 1874 to 1875 and in Tromsø from 1875 to 1880, from 1878 at Tromsø Seminary. He studied from 1880 to 1881 to take the [[cand.theol.]] degree, and was hired as headmaster at Tromsø Seminary in 1883. He remained here to 1920. From 1910 to 1912 he was the [[Minister of Education and Research (Norway)|Minister of Education and Church Affairs]] in [[Konow's Cabinet]]. As a politician he was also a member of Tromsø city council from 1889 to 1907, serving as mayor in the years 1889, 1905 and 1907.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Academic career==
Qvigstad also made a name for himself as an academic. An interest in [[Sami language]] and culture started when he was hired at Tromsø Seminary, and he published his first of 112 academic works in 1881. This was ''Beiträge zur Vergleichung des verwandten Wortvorrathes der Lappischen und der finnischen Sprache'', published in the Finnish journal ''Acta Societatis Scientiarum Fennicae''. Other important inguistic works include ''Nordische Lehnwörter in Lappischen'' (1893). He co-wrote the eighteenth volume of ''[[Norske Gaardnavne]]'', about farm names and place names in Finnmark, and followed with ''Spitsbergens stedsnavne før 1900'' (1927), ''De lappiske stedsnavn i Troms fylke'' (1935), ''De lappiske stedsnavn i Finnmark og Nordland fylker'' (1938) and''De lappiske appellative stedsnavn'' (1944). Historical works include ''Den kvenske indvandring til Nord-Norge'' (1921), about [[Kven people|Kven]] immigration to Northern Norway. [[Cultural history|Cultural historical]] works include ''Lappiske Eventyr og Folkesagn'' (with [[Georg Sandberg]], 1887), ''Lappiske eventyr og sagn'' (four volumes, 1927–1929) and ''Lappische Heilkunde'' (1932). His academic institution was [[Tromsø Museum]], where he was a board member from 1884, and curator of the Sami collections from 1884 to 1931. However, most of his publications came after his retirement age. His last academic work was ''Opptegnelser fra samenes liv'', released in 1954 when Qvigstad was 101 years old.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

He was a member of the [[Société Finno-Ougrienne]] from 1885, the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] from 1888 and the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]] in 1894. He was an honorary member of the Société Finno-Ougrienne from 1910 and Tromsø Museum from 1926, and [[Festschrift]]s were issued for his 75th and 100th birthdays. He was awarded the [[Gunnerus Medal]] in 1930, and in 1943 a "Headmaster Qvigstad's Gold Medal" was inaugurated by Tromsø Museum. He was decorated as a Commander with Star of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] in 1912, and as a Commander of the [[Order of the White Rose of Finland]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

He was a co-founder and board member of Norsk Finnemission from 1888 to 1916 and of the regional [[Norwegian Bible Society]] office from 1889 to 1910.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He was also a board member of [[Tromsø Sparebank]].

{{Social Christianity}}

'''Liberation theology''' is a synthesis of [[Christian theology]] and [[Marxist]] [[socio-economic]] analyses that emphasizes social concern for the poor and the political liberation for oppressed peoples.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Historical Terms'' (1998), Second Edition, Chris Cook, ed., p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and the 1960s, liberation theology was the political [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] of Latin American theologians, such as [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]] of Peru, [[Leonardo Boff]] of Brazil, [[Juan Luis Segundo]] of Uruguay, and [[Jon Sobrino]] of Spain, who popularized the phrase "[[option for the poor|Preferential option for the poor]]".

The Latin American context also produced [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] advocates of liberation theology, such as [[C. René Padilla]] of Ecuador, [[Samuel Escobar]] of Peru, and [[Orlando E. Costas]] of Puerto Rico, who, in the 1970s, called for [[integral mission]], emphasizing [[evangelism]] and [[social responsibility]]. 

Theologies of liberation have developed in other parts of the world such as [[Black theology]] in the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]], [[Palestinian liberation theology]], [[Dalit theology]] in [[India]], and [[Minjung theology]] in [[South Korea]].

== Latin American liberation theology ==
The best-known form of liberation theology is that which developed within the [[Catholic Church]] in [[Latin America]] in the 1950s and 1960s, arising principally as a moral reaction to the poverty and [[social injustice]] in the region. The term was coined in 1971 by the [[Peruvian]] priest [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], who wrote one of the movement's defining books, ''[[A Theology of Liberation]]''. Other noted exponents include [[Leonardo Boff]] of Brazil, [[Jon Sobrino]] of [[Spain]], and [[Juan Luis Segundo]] of Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McBrien, ''Catholicism'' (Harper Collins, 1994), chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Gutierrez, ''A Theology of Liberation'', First (Spanish) edition published in Lima, Peru, 1971; first English edition published by Orbis Books (Maryknoll, New York), 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin American liberation theology met opposition in the United States,&lt;ref name="chomsky"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNDG7ErY-k4|title=Chomsky on Religion|first=|last=Travis Kitchens|date=June 21, 2010|publisher=|accessdate=October 17, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; which accused it of using "[[Marxism#Concepts|Marxist concepts]]", and led to admonishment by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] (CDF) in 1984 and 1986. The Vatican rejected certain forms of Latin American liberation theology for focusing on institutionalized or systemic sin and for identifying Catholic Church hierarchy in South America as members of the same privileged class that had long been oppressing indigenous populations from the arrival of [[Francisco Pizarro|Pizarro]] onward.&lt;ref name="Wojda, Paul J. 1995"&gt;Wojda, Paul J., "Liberation theology," in R.P. McBrien, ed., ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (Harper Collins, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
A major player in the formation of liberation theology was the [[Latin American Episcopal Conference]] (CELAM). Created in 1955 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, CELAM pushed the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–1965) toward a more socially oriented stance.&lt;ref name="Pelton 1995"&gt;Robert Pelton, "Latin America, Catholicism in" in R.P. McBrien, ed., ''The Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism'', Harper Collins, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; However, CELAM never supported liberation theology as such, since liberation theology was frowned upon by the Vatican, with [[Pope Paul VI]] trying to slow the movement after the Second Vatican Council.&lt;ref&gt;According to Cardinal [[Alfonso López Trujillo]], liberation theology was simultaneously created by the [[Reflection Task Force]] of CELAM, and by [[Rubem Alves]]'s book, ''[[Towards a Theology of Liberation]]'' (1968). However, Cardinal Trujillo had himself been general secretary of CELAM, and president of CELAM's Reflection Task Force. [[Antonio Samorè|Cardinal Samorè]], who as leader of the [[Pontifical Commission for Latin America]] was in charge of relations between the [[Roman Curia]] and CELAM, was ordered to put a stop to liberation theology, which was judged antithetical to the Catholic Church's global teachings.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=Previous note does not give sources for CELAM's attitude to Lib Theol|date=May 2015}}

More or less at the same time as the initial publications of Latin American liberation theology are also found voices of [[black theology|Black liberation theology]] and [[feminist theology|feminist liberation theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2005|title=Liberation Theology|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/liberation_theology.aspx|journal=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas|last1=Vuola|first1=Elina|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second Vatican Council, CELAM held two conferences which were important in determining the future of liberation theology: [[Second Episcopal Conference of Latin America|the first]] was held in [[Conference of Latin American Bishops|Medellín, Colombia]], in 1968, and the second in [[Puebla]], Mexico, in January 1979.&lt;ref name="Pelton 1995" /&gt; The Medellín conference debated how to apply the teachings of Vatican II to Latin America, and its conclusions were strongly influenced by liberation theology.&lt;ref name="Wojda, Paul J. 1995" /&gt; Although liberation theology grew out of these officially recognized ideas, the Medellín document is not a liberation theology document. It did, however, lay the groundwork, and since then liberation theology has developed rapidly in the Latin American Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;''Liberation Theology and Its Role in Latin America''. Elisabeth Erin Williams. Monitor: Journal of International Studies. The College of William and Mary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal [[Alfonso López Trujillo]] was a central figure after the Medellín Conference, who as priest in Bogota he did not attend, and was elected in 1972 as general secretary of CELAM, and then, its president in 1979 (at the Puebla conference). He represented a more orthodox position, becoming a favourite of [[Pope John Paul II]] and the "principal scourge of liberation theology."&lt;ref name="Curti"&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Elena |last=Curti |title=Study in Scarlet |magazine=The Tablet |date=May 8, 2010 |p=4 &lt;!--4,5,13--&gt; |issn=0039-8837 |url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/}} (Available upon request)&lt;/ref&gt; Trujillo's faction became predominant in CELAM after the 1972 [[Sucre]] conference, and in the Roman Curia after the CELAM conference in [[Puebla]], Mexico, in January 1979.

Despite the orthodox bishops' predominance in CELAM, a more radical form of liberation theology remained much supported in South America. Thus, the 1979 Puebla Conference was an opportunity for orthodox bishops to reassert control of the radical elements, but they failed. At the Puebla Conference, the orthodox reorientation was met by strong opposition from the liberal part of the clergy, which supported the concept of a "[[preferential option for the poor]]". This concept had been approved at the Medellín conference by Ricard Durand, president of the [[Commission about Poverty]].

Pope John Paul II gave the opening speech at the Puebla Conference. The general tone of his remarks was conciliatory. He criticized radical liberation theology, saying, "this idea of Christ as a political figure, a revolutionary, as the subversive of Nazareth, does not tally with the Church's [[Catechism|catechesis]]";&lt;ref name="Speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/speeches/1979/january/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19790128_messico-puebla-episc-latam.html|title=To members of the 3rd General Conference of the Latin American Episcopate, Puebla – Republic of Mexico (January 28, 1979) – John Paul II|website=w2.vatican.va|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he did acknowledge that "the growing wealth of a few parallels the growing poverty of the masses,"&lt;ref name="Speech" /&gt; and affirmed both the ''principle'' of private property and that the Church "must preach, educate individuals and collectivities, form public opinion, and offer orientations to the leaders of the peoples" towards the goal of a "more just and equitable distribution of goods".&lt;ref name="Speech" /&gt;

Some liberation theologians, however, including Gustavo Gutiérrez, had been barred from attending the Puebla Conference. Working from a seminary and with aid from sympathetic, liberal bishops, they partially obstructed other clergy's efforts to ensure that the Puebla Conference documents satisfied conservative concerns. Within four hours of the Pope's speech, Gutiérrez and the other priests wrote a 20-page refutation, which was circulated at the conference, and has been claimed to have influenced the final outcome of the conference. According to a socio-political study of liberation theology in Latin America, a quarter of the final Puebla documents were written by theologians who were ''not invited'' to the conference.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Christian. ''The Emergence of Liberation Theology''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===
Liberation theology could be interpreted as an attempt to return to the [[gospel]] of the [[early church]] where Christianity is politically and culturally decentralized.&lt;ref&gt;ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PEOPLES, Populorum Progressio, Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Pope Paul VI promulgated on March 26, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberation theology proposes to fight poverty by addressing its alleged source, sin. In so doing, it explores the relationship between [[Christian theology]] (especially [[Roman Catholic theology|Roman Catholic]]) and political activism, especially in relation to [[economic justice]], [[poverty]], and [[human rights]]. The principal methodological innovation is seeing theology from the perspective of the poor and the oppressed. For example, [[Jon Sobrino]] argues that the poor are a privileged channel of [[Grace (Christianity)|God's grace]].

Some liberation theologians base their social action upon the [[Bible]] scriptures describing the mission of [[Jesus Christ]], as [[But to bring a sword|bringing a sword]] ([[social unrest]]), e.g., {{bible verse||Isaiah|61:1|KJV}}, {{bible verse||Matthew|10:34|KJV}}, {{bible verse||Luke|22:35–38|KJV}} — and ''not'' as bringing peace ([[social order]]).{{Better source|date=May 2010}} This biblical interpretation is a call to ''action'' against poverty, and the sin engendering it, to affect Jesus Christ's mission of justice in this world.

[[Gustavo Gutiérrez]] gave the movement its name with his 1971 book, ''A Theology of Liberation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teología de la liberación: perspectivas|last=Gutiérrez|first=Gustavo|publisher=Centro de Estudios y Publicaciones (CEP)|year=1971|isbn=|location=Lima, Perú|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Gutiérrez combined populist ideas with the social teachings of the Catholic Church. He was influenced by an existing socialist current in the Church which included organizations such as the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] and the ''[[Jeunesse Ouvrière Chrétienne]]'', a Belgian Christian youth worker organization. He was also influenced by [[Paul Gauthier (theologian)|Paul Gauthier]]'s ''[[The Poor, Jesus and the Church]]'' (1965). Gutiérrez's book is based on an understanding of history in which the human being is seen as assuming conscious responsibility for human destiny, and yet Christ the Saviour liberates the human race from sin, which is the root of all disruption of friendship and of all injustice and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Gutierrez, ''A Theology of Liberation''(London: SCM Press,1974) 36f&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutiérrez also popularized the phrase "[[preferential option for the poor]]", which became a slogan of liberation theology and later appeared in addresses of the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ratzinger | first = Joseph | authorlink = Pope Benedict XVI | title = Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Fathers of the General Congregation of the Society of Jesus | website = Speeches February 2008 | publisher = The Holy See | date = February 21, 2008 | url = http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/february/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20080221_gesuiti_en.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from the biblical motif on the poor, Gutiérrez asserts that God is revealed as having a preference for those people who are “insignificant", "marginalized", “unimportant", "needy", "despised", and "defenseless". Moreover, he makes clear that terminology of "the poor" in scripture has social and economic connotations that etymologically go back to the Greek word, ''ptōchos''.&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez, Gustavo. The God of Life. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1991. (Original: El Dios de la vida. Lima: CEP, 1989.) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; To be sure, as to not misinterpret Gutiérrez’s definition of the term "preferential option", he stresses, "Preference implies the universality of God’s love, which excludes no one. It is only within the framework of this universality that we can understand the preference, that is, 'what comes first'."&lt;ref&gt;Nickoloff, James B. ed. Gustavo Gutierrez: Essential Writings. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1996, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutiérrez emphasized practice (or, more technically, "[[praxis (process)|praxis]]") over doctrine.  Gutiérrez clarified his position by advocating a circular relationship between [[orthodoxy]] and [[orthopraxis]] seeing the two as having a symbiotic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez, Gustavo. The Truth Shall Make You Free: Confrontations. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1990. (Original: La verdad los hara libres: confrontaciones. Lima: CEP, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Gutierrez' reading of prophets condemning oppression and injustice against the poor (i.e., Jeremiah 22:13–17) informs his assertion that to know God (orthodoxy) is to do justice (orthopraxis).&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez, Gustavo. The Power of Poor in History. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1983. (Original: La fuerza historica de los obres: seleccion de trabajos. Lima: CEP, 1971.)&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] (later Pope Benedict XVI), however, criticized liberation theology for elevating orthopraxis to the level of orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ratzinger, Joseph Cardinal (2007). "Liberation Theology: Preliminary Notes," in The Ratzinger Report.|title=Reprinted in: J.F. Thornton and S.B. Varenne, eds., The Essential Pope Benedict XVI|year=2007|publisher=Online version: Harper Collins,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard McBrien summarizes this concept as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;God is disclosed in the historical "praxis" of liberation. It is the situation, and our passionate and reflective involvement in it, which mediates the Word of God. Today that Word is mediated through the cries of the poor and the oppressed.&lt;ref&gt;McBrien, R.P. "Catholicism" (Harper Collins, 1995), pp. 249–250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another important hallmark for Gutiérrez's brand of liberation theology is an interpretation of revelation as "history". For example, Gutiérrez wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;History is the scene of the revelation God makes of the mystery of his person. His word reaches us in the measure of our involvement in the evolution of history.&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez, G. "Faith as Freedom," ‘’Horizons’’ 2/1, Spring 1975, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gutiérrez also considered the Church to be the "sacrament of history", an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace, thus pointing to the doctrine of universal salvation as the true means to eternal life, and assigning the Church itself to a somewhat temporal role, namely, liberation.

=== Practice ===
One of the most radical aspects of liberation theology was the social organization, or reorganization, of church practice through the model of [[Christian base communities]]. Liberation theology strove to be a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] movement in practice, with biblical interpretation and liturgical practice designed by lay practitioners themselves, rather than by the orthodox Church hierarchy. In this context, sacred text interpretation is understood as "praxis". Liberation theology seeks to interpret the actions of the Catholic Church and the teachings of Jesus Christ from the perspective of the poor and disadvantaged. In Latin America, liberation theologians specifically target the severe disparities between rich and poor in the existing social and economic orders within the nations' political and corporate structures. It is a strong critique of the various economic and social structures, such as an oppressive government, dependence upon First World countries and the traditional hierarchical Church, that allow some to be extremely rich while others are unable to even have safe drinking water.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

The journalist and writer [[Penny Lernoux]] described this aspect of liberation theology in her numerous and committed writings intended to explain the movement's ideas in North America. Base communities were small gatherings, usually outside of churches, in which the Bible could be discussed, and Mass could be said. They were especially active in rural parts of Latin America where parish priests were not always available, as they placed a high value on [[Laity|lay]] participation. In May 2007, it was estimated that 80,000 base communities existed in Brazil.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/07/world/americas/07theology.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5089&amp;en=34f757c655dbef9f&amp;ex=1336190400&amp;partner=rssyahoo&amp;emc=rss "As Pope Heads to Brazil, a Rival Theology Persists"] ''The New York Times'' May 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneously, [[Fanmi Lavalas]] in [[Haiti]], the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] in [[Brazil]], and [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] are three organizations that make use of liberation theology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://betacanadaandtheworld.com/liberationtheology.html Liberation Theology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311004611/http://betacanadaandtheworld.com/liberationtheology.html |date=March 11, 2012 }}, Canada &amp; the World, February 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazilian liberation theology ===
The Brazilian Catholic Church is arguably one of the most theologically progressive Catholic congregations due, in large part, to a history of violent military and political conflicts as well as a divisive socioeconomic climate. During [[Brazilian military government|Brazil's military rule]] from 1964 to 1985, the Catholic Church and its members assumed responsibility to provide services to the poor and disenfranchised, often under threat of persecution. The Vatican II and Medellín conference innovations in liberation theology entered the Brazilian Church as the Brazilian lower classes experienced sharply deteriorating economic and political conditions. Among these were an increase in landownership concentration, a decline in wages and standards of living, and a rise in the military state's political repression and violence, including mass detainment, torture, and the assassination of political opponents.&lt;ref name=Gurupa /&gt;

==== Base ecclesial communities ====
After decades of repression from the government authorities, the liberationist Catholic Church in Brazil is absent of traditional centralization and encourages an increased lay participation. Faced with a severe priest shortage, much of the Brazilian Catholic Church is organized into Base Ecclesial Communities or, "CEBs" in which the Mass, community spirituality programs, and community needs are led or addressed by a single clergy member or a trained lay member in either a small chapel or an individual's home. The CEBs introduced new social ideas and democratic methods which led to many participants' active involvement in popular movements of Brazil that worked for progressive social change. An example of progressive social change initiated by the CEBs is in [[Nova Iguaçu]]. A health program began there to try to organize the population in order to remedy widespread malnutrition, open sewers, and other health hazards.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt; Eventually the neighbourhood initiative reached a national interest level where it then became a mass movement in nearly every neighbourhood. Initiatives like the health program in Nova Iguaçu illustrate how CEBs have helped the transition from military to democratic rule.

While liberation theology has brought about significant progressive reforms in Brazil, anthropologist Robin Nagle questions the effectiveness of Catholic Church theology in Brazil. Nagle concentrates on the conflict between conservatives and liberationists in [[Recife]], Brazil, in 1990. The poor neighbourhood of Morro da Conceição had a liberationist priest named Reginaldo who was expelled by the traditionalist archbishop because the archbishop found Reginaldo's politics and social theology annoying and adverse to his own agenda. When Reginaldo and his followers refused to accept the expulsion and the new priest, the archbishop called in the Military Police. Conversely, the event did not cause a mass response because the liberationist agenda aroused distrust and even hatred among many of its intended audience. The main reason was that it was too much to ask poor parishioners to embrace a Church focused more on the troubles of this life than solace in the next.&lt;ref name=Virgin&gt;''Claiming the Virgin:The Broken Promise of Liberation Theology in Brazil''. Robin Nagle. New York: Routledge, 1997. xii+224 pp., addendums, notes, glossary, bibliography, index.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Robin Nagle claims that liberation theology is ineffective for genuine social change, anthropologist Manuel Vásquez argues that liberation theology embraced by CEBs create a twofold effect, because it not only provided moral justification for resistance but it also served as a means to organize the resistance. Many people come to the CEB through conversion experiences, but also because they are keenly concerned with the spiritual and infrastructural needs of their community.&lt;ref name=Vasquez&gt;The Brazilian Popular Church and the Crisis of Modernity. Manuel A. Vasquez. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 302 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his fieldwork in working-class neighbourhoods of [[Rio de Janeiro]], Vásquez reveals that CEBs combat disenfranchisement but also serve to overcome the obstacles associated with materialism and globalization. The social and political impact can be viewed in terms of initial consciousness-raising, the motivation for involvement, the sense of community they develop, the experience of grassroots democracy, the direct actions they engage in, and finally, directly political actions.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

==== Liberation theology and indigenous Brazil ====

===== The Tapeba =====
Anthropologist and author Max Maranhão Piorsky Aires analyzes the influence of liberation theology on the transformation of the indigenous [[Tapeba people]] of Brazil from poor, uneducated inhabitants neglected by the state to rights-bearing and involved citizens. Specifically he largely attributes the work of the Brazilian Catholic Church to the progression of the Tapeba. The Catholic Church enlisted state authorities, [[anthropologist]]s, and journalists to help uncover the identity of neglected indigenous peoples of Brazil. Early recognition by missionaries and followers of liberation theology stimulated indigenous identification of the Tapeba population as a possibility for attaining rights, especially land, health, and education.&lt;ref name=Tapeba&gt;''Legalizing Indigenous Identities: The Tapeba Struggle for Land and Schools in Caucaia, Brazil''. Max Maranhao Piorsky Aires. The Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 320–340. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church gathered and contributed historical knowledge of indigenous territory and identity of the Tapeba in Caucaia that ultimately succeeded in the tribes obtaining a legally codified identity as well as a rightful place as Brazilian subjects.

===== Gurupá =====
In [[Gurupá]], the Catholic Church employed liberation theology to defend indigenous tribes, farmers, and extractors from land expropriation by federal or corporate forces. New religious ideas, in the form of liberation theology, have fortified and legitimized an evolving political culture of resistance.&lt;ref name=Gurupa&gt;PACE, R. (1992), Social conflict and political activism in the Brazilian Amazon: a case study of Gurupá. American Ethnologist, 19: 710–732. doi: 10.1525/ae.1992.19.4.02a00050&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Church-supported Base Ecclesial Communities (CEBs) have promoted stronger social connections among community members that has led to more effective activism in Gurupá. Anthropologist Richard Pace's study of Gurupá revealed that CEBs assured safety in united activism, and, combined with liberation theology, encouraged members to challenge landowner's commercial monopolies and fight for better standards of living. Pace references a specific incident in the CEB of [[Nossa Senhora de Fátima, Santa Maria|Nossa Senhora de Fátima]], in which a community of 24 families of farmers, timber extractors, and traders resisted an extra-regional timber extraction firm. The community negotiated an agreement with the firm that gained them a higher standard of living that included imported goods, increased food availability, and access to health care. While severe social dislocations such as government-initiated capitalist penetration, land expropriation, and poor wages persist, small-farmer activism is fortified by liberation theology and receives structural support from unions, political parties, and church organizations.&lt;ref name=Gurupa /&gt;

=== Vatican reaction ===

==== Joseph Ratzinger ====
In March 1983, Cardinal [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), head of the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] (CDF), made ten observations of Gustavo Gutiérrez's theology, accusing Gutiérrez of politically interpreting the Bible in supporting temporal messianism, and stating that the predominance of [[orthopraxis]] over orthodoxy in his thought proved a Marxist influence. Ratzinger objected that the spiritual concept of the Church as "People of God" is transformed into a "Marxist myth". In liberation theology he declared, the "'people' is the antithesis of the hierarchy, the antithesis of all institutions, which are seen as oppressive powers. Ultimately anyone who participates in the class struggle is a member of the 'people'; the 'Church of the people' becomes the antagonist of the hierarchical Church."&lt;ref name=preliminary&gt;{{cite book|last=Ratzinger|first=Joseph Cardinal|title="Liberation Theology: Preliminary Notes," in The Ratzinger Report. Reprinted in: J.F. Thornton and S.B. Varenne, eds., The Essential Pope Benedict XVI|year=2007|publisher=Harper Collins, 2007|location=Online version}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratzinger did praise liberation theology in some respects, including its ideal of justice, its rejection of violence, and its stress on "the responsibility which Christians necessarily bear for the poor and oppressed".&lt;ref name=preliminary /&gt;  He subsequently stated that no one could be neutral in the face of injustice, and referred to the "crimes" of [[colonialism]] and the "scandal" of the [[arms race]]. Nonetheless, media reports tended to assume that the condemnation of "liberation theology" meant a rejection of such attitudes and an endorsement of [[conservative]] politics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In 1984, it was reported that a meeting occurred between the CDF and the CELAM bishops, during which a rift developed between Ratzinger and some of the bishops,&lt;ref name="Curti" /&gt;  with Ratzinger issuing official condemnations of certain elements of liberation theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith,|title="Instruction on certain aspects of the 'Theology of Liberation,'" Origins 14/13|date=September 13, 1984|location=Online version}}[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19840806_theology-liberation_en.html Online version]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, .|title="Instruction on Christian Freedom and Liberation," Origins 15/44|date=April 17, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "Instructions" rejected as Marxist the idea that [[class struggle]] is fundamental to history, and rejected the interpretation of religious phenomena such as the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] and the [[Eucharist]] in exclusively political terms.  Ratzinger further stated that liberation theology had a major flaw in that it attempted to apply Christ's sermon on the mount teachings about the poor to present social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ratzinger|first=Cardinal|title=op cit|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He asserted that Christ's teaching on the poor meant that we will be judged when we die, with particular attention to how we personally have treated the poor.

Ratzinger also argued that liberation theology is not originally a "grass-roots" movement among the poor, but rather, a creation of Western intellectuals: "an attempt to test, in a concrete scenario, ideologies that have been invented in the laboratory by European theologians" and in a certain sense itself a form of "cultural imperialism". Ratzinger saw this as a reaction to the demise or near-demise of the "Marxist myth" in the West.&lt;ref name=preliminary /&gt;

Throughout the 1990s, Ratzinger, as prefect of the CDF, continued to condemn these elements in liberation theology, and prohibited dissident priests from teaching such doctrines in the Catholic Church's name. [[Leonardo Boff]] was suspended and others were censured. [[Tissa Balasuriya]], in [[Sri Lanka]], was excommunicated. [[Sebastian Kappen]], an Indian theologian, was also censured for his book ''Jesus and Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kappen|first=Sebastian|title=Jesus and Freedom. In 1980, the CDF asked the General of the Society of Jesus (of which Kappen was a member) to disavow this book. Kappen responded with a pamphlet entitled "Censorship and the Future of Asian Theology." No further action was taken by the Vatican on this matter|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Ratzinger's influence, theological formation schools were forbidden from using the Catholic Church's organization and grounds to teach liberation theology in the sense of theology using unacceptable Marxist ideas, not in the broader sense.

==== Towards reconciliation under Pope Francis ====
According to Roberto Bosca, a historian at [[Austral University (Argentina)|Austral University]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Pope Francis|Jorge Bergoglio]] (later Pope Francis) had "a reputation as an opponent of liberation theology during the 1970s" but he "accepted the premise of liberation theology, especially the option for the poor, but in a 'nonideological' fashion."&lt;ref name=Allen2013 /&gt; Before becoming Pope, Bergoglio said, "The option for the poor comes from the first centuries of Christianity. It's the Gospel itself. If you were to read one of the sermons of the first [[Church Fathers|fathers of the Church]], from the second or third centuries, about how you should treat the poor, you’d say it was [[Maoism|Maoist]] or [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]]. The Church has always had the honor of this preferential option for the poor ... At the [[Second Vatican Council]] the Church was redefined as the People of God and this idea really took off at the Second Conference of the Latin-American bishops in [[Medellín]]."&lt;ref&gt;Transcript of 2010 judicial inquiry, "[http://www.abuelas.org.ar/material/documentos/BERGOGLIO2.pdf Bergoglio Declara ante el TOF N&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611191146/http://www.abuelas.org.ar/material/documentos/BERGOGLIO2.pdf |date=June 11, 2013 }}," translated in {{Citation | last = Ivereigh| first = Austen | author-link = Austen Ivereigh | publication-date = 2014 | title = The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope | edition = Kindle | publisher = Henry Holt and Co. | publication-place = New York | at = locations 1897–1903 | isbn = 978-1-62779-158-8 | date = 2014-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosca said Bergoglio was not opposed to liberation theology itself but to "giving a Catholic blessing to armed insurgency", specifically the [[Montoneros]], who claimed liberation theology as part of their political ideology.&lt;ref name=Allen2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=John L.

On September 11, 2013, Pope Francis hosted Gutiérrez in his residence, leading some to comment that this was a sign of warming relations between the hierarchy and liberation theologians.&lt;ref name=rocca&gt;{{cite news|last=Rocca|first=Francis X.|title=Under Pope Francis, liberation theology comes of age|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2013/under-pope-francis-liberation-theology-comes-of-age.cfm|accessdate=January 25, 2014|newspaper=Catholic News Service|date=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McElwee|first=Joshua J.|title=Pope meets with liberation theology pioneer|url=http://ncronline.org/news/theology/pope-meets-liberation-theology-pioneer|accessdate=January 25, 2014 |newspaper=National Catholic Reporter|date=September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' published an article praising Gutiérrez by the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Archbishop [[Gerhard Ludwig Müller|Gerhard Müller]].&lt;ref name=rocca /&gt; On January 18, 2014, Pope Francis met with Arturo Paoli, an Italian priest whom the Pope knew from Paoli's long service in Argentina. Paoli is recognized as an exponent of liberation theology ''avant la lettre'' and the meeting was seen as a sign of "reconciliation" between the Vatican and the liberationists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen Jr.|first=John L.|title=Truisms in Catholic life and a rundown of Rome news|url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/all-things-catholic/truisms-catholic-life-and-rundown-rome-news|accessdate=January 25, 2014|newspaper=National Catholic Reporter|date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann|Miguel d'Escoto]], a Maryknoll priest from [[Nicaragua]], had been sanctioned with an ''a divinis'' suspension from his public functions in 1984 by Pope John Paul II, for political activity in the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Pope Francis lifted the suspension in August 2014, in response to a request by d'Escoto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-28656661|title=BBC News – Pope reinstates suspended Nicaraguan priest D'Escoto|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 2015 press conference in the Vatican hosted by [[Caritas International]], the federation of Catholic relief agencies, Gutiérrez noted that while there had been some difficult moments in the past dialogue with the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], liberation theology had never been condemned.  Although he saw an increasingly clear emphasis on Church teachings on the poor, he did not consider that liberation theology was undergoing a rehabilitation, since it had never been "dishabilitated".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = O'Connell | first = Gerard | title = Updated: Gutiérrez: 'The Vatican Never Condemned the Theology of Liberation' | journal = [[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]] | date = May 12, 2015 | url = http://americamagazine.org/content/dispatches/gutierrez-vatican-never-condemned-theology-liberation | accessdate = May 25, 2015 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150526044306/http://americamagazine.org/content/dispatches/gutierrez-vatican-never-condemned-theology-liberation | archivedate = May 26, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin American integral mission ==
{{Main|Integral mission}}
Integral mission or holistic mission is a term coined in Spanish as ''misión integral'' in the 1970s by members of the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] group [[Latin American Theological Fellowship]] (or FTL, its Spanish acronym) to describe an understanding of Christian mission which embraces both the [[evangelism]] and [[social responsibility]]. Since [[First International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne]] 1974, integral mission has influenced a significant number of evangelicals around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMhsoyVuefIC&amp;pg=PA151|title=The Global Diffusion of Evangelicalism: The Age of Billy Graham and John Stott|last=Stanley|first=Brian|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-8308-2585-1|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=151–180|language=en|quote=|author-link=Brian Stanley (historian)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_UtDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA193|title=The End of Theology: Shaping Theology for the Sake of Mission|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David C.|publisher=Fortress Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-5064-0592-6|editor-last=Sexton|editor-first=Jason S.|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=193–210|language=en|chapter=The Widening of Christian Mission: C.

The word ''integral'' is used in Spanish to describe wholeness (as in wholemeal bread or whole wheat).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Theologians use it to describe an understanding of Christian mission that affirms the importance of expressing the love of God and neighbourly love through every means possible. Proponents such as [[C. René Padilla]] of [[Ecuador]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7X2UPpL23qAC|title=Mission Between the Times: Essays on the Kingdom|last=Padilla|first=C.

Costas|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have wanted to emphasize the breadth of the Good News and of the Christian mission, and used the word integral to signal their discomfort with conceptions of Christian mission based on a dichotomy between evangelism and social involvement.

The proponents of integral mission argue that the concept of integral mission is nothing new – rather, it is rooted in Scripture and wonderfully exemplified in Jesus’ own ministry. "Integral mission" is only a distinct vocabulary for a holistic understanding of mission that has become important in the past forty years in order to distinguish it from widely held but dualistic approaches that emphasize either evangelism or social responsibility.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Black theology ==
{{Main|Black theology}}
Black theology refers to a theological perspective which originated in some [[black church]]es in the [[United States]] and later in other parts of the world, which contextualizes [[Christianity]] in an attempt to help those of African descent overcome oppression. It especially focuses on the [[injustice]]s committed against [[African American]]s and black [[South African people|South Africans]] during [[Jim Crow laws|American segregation]] and [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]], respectively.

Black theology seeks to liberate people of color from multiple forms of political, social, economic, and religious subjugation and views [[Christian theology]] as a theology of liberation—"a rational study of the being of God in the world in light of the existential situation of an oppressed community, relating the forces of liberation to the essence of the Gospel, which is [[Jesus]] Christ," writes [[James H. Cone|James Hal Cone]], one of the original advocates of the perspective. Black theology mixes [[Christianity]] with questions of [[civil rights]], particularly raised by the [[Black Power movement]] and the [[Black Consciousness Movement]].

== Palestinian liberation theology ==
{{See also|Political theology in the Middle East#Palestinian liberation theology}}
Palestinian liberation theology is an expression of [[Political theology in the Middle East|political theology]] and a [[inculturation|contextual theology]] that represents an attempt by a number of independently working Palestinian theologians from various denominations—mostly [[Protestant]] mainline churches—to articulate the gospel message in such a way as to make that liberating gospel relevant to the perceived needs of their indigenous flocks. As a rule, this articulation involves a condemnation of the State of [[Israel]], a theological underpinning of Palestinian resistance to Israel as well as Palestinian national aspirations, and an intense valorization of Palestinian ethnic and cultural identity as guarantors of a truer grasp of the gospel by virtue of the fact that they are inhabitants of the land of [[Jesus]] and the [[Bible]]. The principal figure in Palestinian liberation theology is the [[Anglican]] cleric [[Naim Ateek]], founder of the [[Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ateek|first1=Naim|title=Justice and only Justice|date=1989|publisher=Orbis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Eastern Pennsylvania, the [[Panther Creek (Little Schuylkill River)|valley of the Panther Creek]] tributary of the [[Little Schuylkill River]], a very small and relatively short mountain creek, was historically important due to its stranglehold on energy production, a key region central to the industrial development of the United States from the 1820s through the 1870s, and remained important as an energy producing region until decline of the Eastern U.S. Steel Industries in the 1960s.

'''Panther Creek Valley''' lies between and over the [[Anthracite]] ladened folds of the two long near parallel ridgelines, [[Nesquehoning Ridge|Nesquehoning]] and [[Pisgah Ridge]]s forming the side walls and supplying the wealth which shipped from the Panther Creek Valley making the region historically important, as for several decades its land owners, ''[[Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company]] '''(LC&amp;N)''''' held a virtual monopoly on Anthracite produced and shipped not only to eastern U.S. Cities via the [[Lehigh Canal]], but to transoceanic markets.

For perspective, LC&amp;N must be viewed as a high-tech company of its day, as well as an early American conglomerate with efforts in many fields; a company which, from its start shortly after people learned to get Anthracite to burn, moved aggressively intelligently using emerging technologies to exploit the marked fuel shortage developing in post-revolutionary era cities and towns; wherein local wood bearing lands had gradually become scarce driving up the price of firewood, including charcoal needed for the fledgling North American iron foundries and dependent manufacturing industries from Boston to Richmond. 

The twin needs of heating buildings and heat for industrial processes began reshaping the world using technology by the middle of the eighteenth century in Europe&amp;mdash;eventually giving rise to public and privately funded canal projects, the use of coal, pumps so coal could be mined, steam engines, and finally rail roads&amp;mdash;all initially coming about, so people and industries could have and use heat, overcoming the energy crises of their respective areas &amp; eras. While somewhat delayed in time from the older fuel crises plaguing Great Britain, and continental Europe, the growing fuel shortages in Eastern U.S. cities and young industrial systems from 1800 onwards applied the same pressures; causing the same solutions to be considered locally as well, and were widely debated as public policies as the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]] and implemented in part by both local business interests, and the various state governments. Business interests and local governments in the young United States, were highly intertwined and there was much regional competitiveness. So there is little surprise to find such as the Pennsylvania, New York, and Maryland legislatures all put into place proactive programs to enhance transportation penetration to the new frontiers, the [[Ohio Country]] and [[Northwest Territory|Northwest Territories]] as American's looked west and plotted settlements, manufactories, and the mindset in business was still much influenced by [[Mercantilism]] and its beliefs of a static limited market, so were focused on growing industries using the internal markets of newly settled western lands.

Well before the presidential election of 1824 gave a renewed impetus to economic philosophies now called the [[American School (economics)|American School]], Philadelphia region private interests armed by newly publicized know-how of how to successfully ignite and sustain a clean burning fire using Anthracite, took notice of the fuel, its availability (it was discovered locally in the 1790s)... &lt;!--
the new knowledge's of seeing business opportunities and overcoming obstacles others found to be impossibilities, inventing solutions methodically to advance its interests. In the process, they

[[File:1928 Philip Guedalla.jpg|thumb|Philip Guedalla in 1928]]
'''Philip Guedalla''' (12 March 1889 – 16 December 1944) was an English [[barrister]], and a popular historical and travel writer and [[biographer]]. His [[wit]] and [[epigram]]s are well-known, one example being "Even reviewers read a Preface," another being "History repeats itself. Historians repeat each other."  He also was the originator of a now-common theory on [[Henry James]], writing that "The work of Henry James has always seemed divisible by a simple dynastic arrangement into three reigns: James I, James II, and the Old Pretender".

==Family and education==
Guedalla was born in [[Maida Vale]], London, into a secular Jewish family of Spanish origin; in later life he embraced his Jewish identity. He was educated at [[Rugby School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he in 1911 was the [[President of the Oxford Union]]; and was published in ''[[Oxford Poetry]] 1910–1913''. In 1919 he married Nellie Maude Reitlinger, the daughter of a banker. They never had children.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Elton (revised by Mark Pottle), ''Philip Guedalla'' in ''Dictionary of National Biography'', OUP 2004-08&lt;/ref&gt; Asked how to say his name, he told ''The [[Literary Digest]]'' "My own pronunciation is ''gwuh-dal'lah''. I have very little doubt that this is wholly incorrect."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Earle Funk]], ''What's the Name, Please?'', Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Having been [[called to the Bar]] by the [[Inner Temple]], Guedalla practised as a [[barrister]] from 1913 to 1923, before turning to writing. During the [[First World War]] he organised and acted as secretary to the [[Flax]] Control Board and also served as legal adviser to the Contracts Departments of the [[War Office]] and the [[Ministry of Munitions]].&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 18 December 1944 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In [[World War II]] he served in the [[Royal Air Force]], with the rank of [[Squadron Leader]].

==Politics==
Guedalla was a parliamentary candidate for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] five times, always unsuccessfully.
He first stood for Parliament as a Liberal at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922 general election]] in [[Hackney North (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney North]] in a straight fight with the incumbent [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Sir Walter Greene, 2nd Baronet|Sir Walter Greene]], MP. Greene held the seat with a majority of 4,615 votes.&lt;ref&gt;F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949''; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general election]] Guedalla was adopted as Liberal candidate for the [[North East Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Derbyshire North East]] constituency. This looked as if it might be a winnable seat for the Liberals as at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|general election of 1922]] the Liberal candidate [[Stanley Holmes, 1st Baron Dovercourt|Stanley Holmes]] had come within 15 votes of taking the seat from [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] in a three-cornered contest. Despite the boost the Liberals had received in the run-up to the 1923 general election with the reunion of the [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and [[H H Asquith|Asquithian]] wings of the party, Guedalla was unable to gain Derbyshire North East and fell to the foot of the poll behind the Conservatives.

Guedalla next attempted to enter the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] as Liberal candidate for [[Manchester Rusholme (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Rusholme]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]]. This had been a Liberal seat between 1923 and 1924 having been held by [[Charles Masterman]] a former Liberal [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet minister]]. Guedalla maintained second place behind the sitting Tory MP Sir [[Frank Boyd Merriman]] but was unable to regain the seat.&lt;ref&gt;F W S Craig, op cit p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 general election]] Guedalla moved constituencies again, this time to nearby [[Manchester Withington (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Withington]]. This was a Liberal seat, held between 1923–1924 and 1929-1931 by [[Ernest Simon, 1st Baron Simon of Wythenshawe|Ernest Simon]]. However, in the summer of 1931 an economic crisis led to the formation of a [[National Government (UK)|National Government]] led by [[prime minister]] [[Ramsay MacDonald]] supported by a small number of [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]] MPs and initially backed by the Conservative and Liberal parties. In many constituencies the main opposition party to Labour simply assumed the mantle of the Coalition government but in Manchester the Conservative and Liberal parties could not work together to agree an electoral pact, even in the unique circumstances of the national emergency.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 14 October 1931 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; So Guedalla found himself opposed by [[Edward Fleming]] for the Conservatives who won the seat comfortably with a majority of 14,718.&lt;ref&gt;F W S Craig, op cit p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 he was elected to serve on the Liberal Party Council.&lt;ref&gt;The Liberal Magazine, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Guedalla died in hospital in London on 16 December 1944 at the age of only 55 years, having contracted an illness during his service in the RAF.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 18 December 1944 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Sleuth'' reference==

In the play ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'' by [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]], mystery writer Andrew Wyke says, "Do you agree that the detective story is the normal recreation of noble minds? I'm quoting from Philip Guedalla, a biographer of the thirties, that golden age when every Cabinet Minister had a thriller by his bedside and all detectives were titled." &lt;ref&gt;Sleuth: A Play

'''Prienai''' ({{IPA-lt|prʲɪɛaːɪ|-|Prienai.ogg}}) is a city in [[Lithuania]] situated on the [[Neman River|Nemunas River]], {{Convert|29|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Kaunas]]. In 2011 the city had 9,867 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statistics.bookdesign.lt/table_125_02.htm?lang=en |title=2011 census |publisher=Statistikos Departamentas (Lithuania) |accessdate=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the city is a derivative from a surname ''Prienas''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Vanagas. Lietuvos miestų vardai. 1996, p.182&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pociūnai Airport]] is associated with the city.

==History==

===Early history===
The history of Prienai and its surroundings is closely linked to that of the [[Baltic region]]. Traces of sporiadic human settlement go back to the [[Neolithic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naujasisgelupis.lt/?p=27192|publisher=Naujasis Gelupis|title=Archeologinis paveldas Prienų rajone|accessdate=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vast majority of archeological findings such as tools and antiquity coins date to the [[Iron Age]], when the region of Prienai was inhabited by early [[Balts|Baltic tribes]].&lt;ref name="naujasisgelupis832"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naujasisgelupis.lt/?p=832|publisher=Naujasis Gelupis|title=Kultūros paveldas mūsų krašte|accessdate=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lush forests, strategically useful valleys, and stunningly beautiful banks of the [[Neman River|Nemunas River]] were among the main reasons why the area became dotted with 28 [[hillforts]], many of which were relatively densely populated thousands of years ago.&lt;ref name="naujasisgelupis832"/&gt;

===Grand Duchy of Lithuania===
The first documented mention of Prienai is in 1502&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regionai.stat.gov.lt/en/kauno_apskritis/prienu_rajono_savivaldybe.html|publisher=Lithuanian Department of Statistics|title=Prienai district municipality|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] [[Alexander of Poland|Alexander]] gave the land of Prienai to the [[Lithuanian nobility|noble]] [[Mykolas Glinskis]], who, following his exile from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], became the tutor of his nephew [[Ivan the Terrible]]. In 1609, the city was granted the [[Magdeburg rights]], though they were greatly expanded in 1791 by the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] [[Stanislaw II Augustus]]. The city's arms showing [[St. George]] killing the dragon was granted in the same year. [[St. George]] was one of the patron saints of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kvb.lt/prie-nemuno/prienai.php|publisher=Kauno Apskrities Viesoji Biblioteka|title=Prienai|accessdate=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1579, Prienai was given by Grand Duke of Lithuania [[Stephen Báthory|Steponas Batoras]] to the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] nobleman Gabriel Bekes, brother of the more famed [[Gáspár Bekes]], for his loyal participation in the [[Livonian War]]. The Bekes family ruled Prienai for the next two decades. Afterwards, it became the property of another Hungarian nobleman, named Kaspar Horvat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/istorija/ldk-istorija-svetimi-svetimsaliai-vengrai-xvi-a-lietuvoje-582-331233|publisher=15min|title=LDK istorija: "Svetimi" svetimšaliai – vengrai XVI a. Lietuvoje|accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1616, the Lithuanian nobleman and politician [[Stefan Pac|Steponas Pacas]], who would later became the [[Offices in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Deputy Chancellor]] of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, acquired Prienai. He and his sons Stanislovas and [[Mikołaj Stefan Pac|Mikalojus Pacas]] owned it up until 1643.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naujasisgelupis.lt/?p=18851|publisher=Naujasis Gelupis|title=Atviru žodžiu apie pagarbą ir atsakomybę krašto istorijai. "Senųjų Prienų beieškant"|accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For almost one and a half centuries, Prienai was ruled by the Butler family. In 1661, Count [[Gothard Wilhelm Butler]], a Lithuanian noblememan of distant [[Scottish descent]], built the Prienai castle.&lt;ref name="gyvenimas1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gyvenimas.eu/2016/05/17/mintys-prienu-miestui-iprasminti-dabarciai-ir-ateiciai/=Gyvenimas|title=Mintys Prienų miestui įprasminti: dabarčiai ir ateičiai|accessdate=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1701, during the [[Great Northern War]], the castle together with its amenities was completely destroyed.&lt;ref name="gyvenimas1"/&gt; In the early 18th century, the city somewhat recovered from the devastation of the Great Northern War and in the place of the former castle, the Butler family had built a spacious two-storeyed [[Baroque]] styled manor house. On the ground floor there was a large guest-hall and 16 rooms. On the first floor there were 11 additional rooms and a sizable great hall. Yet over the course of the next century, the Prienai manor house was gradually abandoned. At the onset of the 20th century, only rubble remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geraprienuose.lt/naujienos/dvaru-pedsakai-prienu-rajono-savivaldybeje/|publisher=Gera Prienuose|title=Dvarų pėdsakai Prienų rajono savivaldybėje|accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first wooden church in Prienai was built in 1604. Thanks to the active personal involvement of a priest named Vaitiekus Izdebskis, seventy years later, later a newer and much larger church was built to replace the old one. The present Baroque styled church was built in 1750, though it was refurbished and slightly expanded in 1875.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Prussia, Napoleon and the Russian Empire===
Following the [[Third Partition of Poland|third partition]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1795, Prienai was invaded and occupied by [[Prussia]]. Prussia ruled there during the years 1795-1807 and made Prienai part of [[New East Prussia]]. At the end of the eighteenth century, Prienai underwent rapid economic growth. During that time a glass factory and a paper mill, one of the largest in Lithuania, were established near the town. The paper mill produced extraordinary high quality white, coloured and wrapping paper, which was often exported to cities as distant as [[Warsaw]] and [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

After [[Napoleon]] defeated Prussia, Prussian occupied Lithuanian territories were transferred to the newly established [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. During the years 1807-1813, Prienai belonged to the Duchy of Warsaw. The [[Napoleonic code]] was then introduced in this region, which abolished [[serfdom]] and guaranteed equality before the law.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Following the demise of Napoleon in 1815 and the [[Congress of Vienna]], Prienai together with its surroundings, were annexed by the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The town dwellers of Prienai, together with the inhabitants of neighbouring towns and villages, actively participated in the [[November Uprising]] of 1830-1831 and the [[January Uprising]] of 1863-1864, both of which sought to liberate Lithuanians from the Russian yoke.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Republic of Lithuania===
Following Lithuania‘s [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|restoration of independence]] in 1918, Prienai became the center of the county and witnessed unprecedented expansion. By 1937 Prienai had a population of around 4,200, there were 4 banks, 2 pharmacies, 121 shops, 5 mills, a number of sawmills and countless workshops in the city.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; At that time the mayor of the city was Julius Greimas, the father of the world renowned [[Lithuania]]n-[[France|French]] literary scientist and semiotician [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mokslasplius.lt/mokslo-lietuva/2006-2011/node/2358.html|publisher=Mokslo Lietuva|title=Greimai ir Prienai|accessdate=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet despite the flurry of diverse economic activity, [[brewing]] was indisputably the most significant industry in Prienai.&lt;ref name="kvitrina1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kvitrina.lt/benicijono-sakovo-alaus-darykla-krasto-istorijos-garbes-zenklas-is-tarpukario-i/#prettyphoto[post_gallery]/1/|publisher=KVITRINA|title=Benicijono Šakovo alaus darykla – krašto istorijos garbės ženklas iš tarpukario|accessdate=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Goldberg beer brewery was established back in 1868 and during the [[interwar period]] its facilities dominated the urban landscape of the city.&lt;ref name="kvitrina1"/&gt; According to local contemporaries, the brewery produced one of the finest beers in Lithuania and its products were regularly exported to [[Latvia]], [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="kvitrina1"/&gt; However, the brewery together with most of its buildings was completely destroyed by the German [[Luftwaffe]] during a bombing raid in June 1941.

[[File:Prienų alaus bravoras.png|thumb|The Goldberg beer brewery.]]

===World War II and its aftermath===
During [[World War II]], when it was occupied by German troops, Prienai lost many of its inhabitants. People [[emigration|emigrated]] or were expelled, while the [[Nazism|Nazis]] killed the [[Jews]]. On August 27, 1941, 1,078 Jews from Prienai and surrounding areas were assassinated in Prienai. The massacre was perpetrated by [[Rollkommando Hamann]] and local Lithuanians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.holocaustatlas.lt/EN/#a_atlas/search/vcntfr=1000.vcntto=5000/page/3/item/36/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[World War II]], Prienai was occupied by [[Soviet Union]] and its population suffered additional losses. Throughout 1945-1946, the [[Soviets]] murdered 39 inhabitants from Prienai and its surroundings.&lt;ref name="prienubiblioteka1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prienubiblioteka.lt/krastotyra/prienai/101-prienu-miesto-istorija|publisher=Prienu biblioteka|title=Prienų miesto istorija |accessdate=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22–23 May 1948, 1,019 Lithuanians from the Prienai area were forced by the Soviets into cattle trains and deported to [[Siberia]]. In 1949, 675 more local people were deported to Siberia.&lt;ref name="prienubiblioteka1"/&gt; Most of the deportees either died there or suffered circumstances that never allowed them to return home.

===Twin towns - Sister cities===
Prienai is a member of the [[Douzelage]], a unique [[town twinning]] association of 24 towns across the [[European Union]]. This active town twinning began in 1991 and there are regular events, such as a produce market from each of the other countries and festivals.&lt;ref name="Douzelage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douzelage.org/ |title=Douzelage.org: Home |publisher=www.douzelage.org |accessdate=2009-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217044329/http://www.douzelage.org/ |archivedate=2010-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DouzelageMembers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douzelage.org/index.php?id=15 |title=Douzelage.org: Member Towns |publisher=www.douzelage.org |accessdate=2009-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406142434/http://www.douzelage.org/index.php?id=15 |archivedate=2009-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions regarding membership are also in hand with three further towns ([[Agros, Cyprus|Agros]] in [[Cyprus]], [[Škofja Loka]] in [[Slovenia]], and [[Tryavna]] in [[Bulgaria]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5163">'''Ralph Niger''', [[Latin]] '''Radulphus Niger''' or '''Radulfus Niger''', [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] '''Ralph the Black''' (c. 1140 – c. 1217), was an [[wikt:Anglo-French|Anglo-French]] theologian and one of the [[English historians in the Middle Ages|English chroniclers]].  He was from [[Bury St. Edmunds]], [[Suffolk]], and became [[Diocese of Gloucester|Archdeacon of Gloucester]].

From around 1160 to 1166, Niger studied in Paris, where he was a student of [[John of Salisbury]] and [[Gerard la Pucelle]], and, at some point in his life, probably also in [[Poitiers]]. At Paris, he may also have been a teacher of [[rhetoric]] and [[dialectics]].

Niger was part of [[Thomas Becket]]'s entourage during the latter's exile in France in the early 1160s and played an important role in connecting the exiled archbishop with [[Pope Alexander III]]'s German ally [[Conrad of Mainz]]. After the reconciliation between [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and Becket, he was employed by the king, but he left England for France after Becket's murder in 1170. After Henry's death in 1189, he returned to England, where he became a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] in [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]].

==Works==
Apart from several theological works, Niger wrote two [[chronicle]]s in Latin, one on the German emperors and the kings of France and England, which runs up to 1206, and the other one treating history from the world's origin up to the year 1199. In his chronicle, he remained a “violent partisan” of Becket&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kyuv9X9wKEcC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=%22Radulfus+Niger%22|title=English Writers: An Attempt Towards a History of English Literature|last=Morley|first=Henry|date=1888|publisher=Cassell|year=|isbn=|volume=3|location=|pages=184|language=en|author-link=Henry Morley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a critic of Henry, declaring that “the king let no year pass without molesting the country with new laws.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9-8fIBVgCQYC&amp;pg=PA439&amp;lpg=PA439&amp;dq=%22Radulfus+Niger%22|title=Law and Revolution, the Formation of the Western Legal Tradition|last=Berman|first=Harold J.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780674020856|location=|pages=439|language=en|author-link=Harold J. Berman}}&lt;/ref&gt; His English chronicle was continued by [[Ralph of Coggeshall]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Niger also wrote a treatise ''De re militari'' in which he was critical towards the [[Third Crusade]].

Niger is an important source for late [[medieval music]] in Britain. A collection of four offices – [[Liturgical year|Nativity, Annunciation, Assumption, and Purification]] — composed by him, both notation and text, is preserved in the library of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (15, fols. 33–43, excepting 42). He introduces the offices with a short Latin treatise on the [[festival|feasts]]. Most of his works are secular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QLz3pbOZLdYC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=%22Radulfus+Niger%22|title=Music in the Medieval English Liturgy: Plainsong &amp; Mediaeval Music Society Centennial Essays|last=Rankin|first=Susan|last2=Hiley|first2=David|date=1993|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|year=|isbn=9780193161252|location=|pages=250|language=en|author-link=Susan Rankin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''René Descartes''' ({{IPAc-en|d|eɪ|ˈ|k|ɑːr|t}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|k|ɑːr|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/descartes "Descartes"] entry in ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ʁəne dekaʁt|lang}}; [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinized]]: '''Renatus Cartesius'''; [[Adjective|adjectival form]]: "Cartesian";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Colie |first=Rosalie L. |title=Light and Enlightenment |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1957 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; 31 March 1596 – 11 February 1650) was a French [[philosopher]], [[Mathematics|mathematician]], and [[scientist]]. A native of the Kingdom of France, he spent about 20 years (1629–49) of his life in the [[Dutch Republic]] after serving for a while in the [[Dutch States Army]] of [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]], [[Prince of Orange]] and the [[Stadtholder]] of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]. He is generally considered one of the most notable intellectual figures of the [[Dutch Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Nadler, Steven: ''The Philosopher, the Priest, and the Painter: A Portrait of Descartes''. (Princeton University Press, 2015, {{ISBN|9780691165752}})&lt;/ref&gt; 

Descartes' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641) continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes' influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] (see [[#Mathematical legacy|below]]) was named after him. He is credited as the father of [[Analytic geometry|analytical geometry]], the bridge between algebra and geometry, used in the discovery of infinitesimal [[calculus]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Descartes was also one of the key figures in the [[Scientific Revolution]].

Descartes refused to accept the authority of previous philosophers. He frequently set his views apart from those of his predecessors. In the opening section of the ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'', an [[Early modern period|early modern]] treatise on emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic "as if no one had written on these matters before". His best known philosophical statement is "[[Cogito, ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]" ({{lang-fr|link=no|Je pense, donc je suis}}; {{lang-la|link=no|Ego cogito, ergo sum}}), found in ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' (1637; written in French and Latin) and ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644; written in Latin).&lt;ref&gt;This idea had already been proposed by the Spanish philosopher [[Gómez Pereira]] a hundred years ago in the form: "I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist" (''nosco me aliquid noscere, &amp; quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum''). See: Gómez Pereira, ''Antoniana Margarita'': "De Immortalitate Animae", 1749 [1554], p. 277; Santos López, Modesto (1986). "Gómez Pereira, médico y filósofo medinense". In: ''Historia de Medina del Campo y su Tierra, volumen I: Nacimiento y expansión'', ed. by Eufemio Lorenzo Sanz, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many elements of his philosophy have precedents in late [[Aristotelianism]], the [[Neostoicism|revived Stoicism]] of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. In his [[natural philosophy]], he differed from the [[Scholasticism|schools]] on two major points: first, he rejected the splitting of [[Matter|corporeal substance]] into matter and form; second, he rejected any appeal to [[Teleology|final ends]], divine or natural, in explaining natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R. |title=Physiology of Behavior |publisher=Pearson: Allyn &amp; Bacon |year=2001 |location=Needham Heights, Massachusetts |page=8 |url= |id= |isbn=0-205-30840-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of God's act of creation.

Descartes laid the foundation for 17th-century continental [[rationalism]], later advocated by [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and opposed by the [[Empiricism|empiricist]] school of thought consisting of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[David Hume|Hume]]. Leibniz, Spinoza&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Moorman, [http://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Spinoza/Texts/The%20Influence%20of%20Mathematics%20on%20the%20Philosophy%20of%20Spinoza.pdf "The Influence of Mathematics on the Philosophy of Spinoza"], ''National Mathematics Magazine'', Vol. 18, No. 3. (Dec., 1943), pp. 108–115.&lt;/ref&gt;, and Descartes were all well versed in mathematics as well as philosophy, and Descartes and Leibniz contributed greatly to science as well.

René Descartes was born in La Haye en Touraine (now [[Descartes, Indre-et-Loire]]&lt;!--Indre-et-Loire did not exist before 1790--&gt;), France, on 31 March 1596.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and Mathematicians: The History of Math Discoveries Around the World|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=99|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Jeanne Brochard, died soon after giving birth to him, and so he was not expected to survive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Descartes' father, Joachim, was a member of the [[Parlement of Brittany]] at [[Rennes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rodis-Lewis |first=Geneviève |chapter=Descartes' Life and the Development of His Philosophy |editor-last=Cottingham |editor-first=John |editor-link=John Cottingham |title=The Cambridge Companion to Descartes |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-36696-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Prhr9FBdQ_MC |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; René lived with his grandmother and with his great-uncle. Although the Descartes family was Roman Catholic, the Poitou region was controlled by the Protestant Huguenots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://all-history.org/world_literature/descartes1.htm All-history.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1607, late because of his fragile health, he entered the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Prytanée National Militaire|Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand]] at [[La Flèche]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and Mathematicians: The History of Math Discoveries Around the World|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=100|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (2006), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; where he was introduced to mathematics and physics, including Galileo's work.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Porter |first1=Roy |authorlink=Roy Porter |title=The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present |edition=paperback edition, 135798642 |year=1999 |origyear=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=Great Britain |isbn=0006374549 |page=217 |chapter=The New Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation in 1614, he studied for two years (1615–16) at the [[University of Poitiers]], earning a ''[[Baccalauréat]]'' and ''[[Licentiate (degree)|Licence]]'' in [[Canon law|canon]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in 1616,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in accordance with his father's wishes that he should become a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last2=Kaufmann |first2=Walter |last=Baird |first=Forrest E. |title=From Plato to Derrida |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2008 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |pages=373–377 |url= |id= |isbn=0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From there he moved to Paris.

In ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', Descartes recalls,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I entirely abandoned the study of letters. Resolving to seek no knowledge other than that of which could be found in myself or else in the great book of the world, I spent the rest of my youth traveling, visiting courts and armies, mixing with people of diverse temperaments and ranks, gathering various experiences, testing myself in the situations which fortune offered me, and at all times reflecting upon whatever came my way so as to derive some profit from it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given his ambition to become a professional military officer, in 1618, Descartes joined, as a [[mercenary]], the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Dutch States Army]] in Breda under the command of [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and undertook a formal study of [[military engineering]], as established by [[Simon Stevin]]. Descartes, therefore, received much encouragement in Breda to advance his knowledge of mathematics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this way, he became acquainted with [[Isaac Beeckman]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the principal of a [[Dordrecht]] school, for whom he wrote the ''Compendium of Music'' (written 1618, published 1650). Together they worked on [[free fall]], [[catenary]], [[conic section]], and [[Hydrostatics|fluid statics]].

===Visions===
According to [[Adrien Baillet]], on the night of 10–11 November 1619 ([[St. Martin's Day]]), while stationed in [[Neuburg an der Donau]], Descartes shut himself in a room with an "oven" (probably a ''Kachelofen'' or [[masonry heater]]) to escape the cold. While within, he had three dreams&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=101|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that a divine spirit revealed to him a new philosophy. However, it is likely that what Descartes considered to be his second dream was actually an episode of [[exploding head syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Otaiku2018"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Otaiku AI | year = 2018 | title = Did René Descartes have Exploding Head Syndrome? | url = | journal = J Clin Sleep Med. | volume =  14| issue = 4| pages =  675–8| doi = 10.5664/jcsm.7068 | pmid = 29609724 | pmc = 5886445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon exiting, he had formulated [[analytical geometry]] and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy. He concluded from these visions that the pursuit of science would prove to be, for him, the pursuit of true wisdom and a central part of his life's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Durant |first1=Will |authorlink1=Will Durant |last2=Durant |first2=Ariel |authorlink2=Ariel Durant |title=[[The Story of Civilization: Part VII, the Age of Reason Begins]] |year=1961 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-671-01320-3 |page=637}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (2006), pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes also saw very clearly that all truths were linked with one another so that finding a fundamental truth and proceeding with logic would open the way to all science. Descartes discovered this basic truth quite soon: his famous "[[Cogito, ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]".&lt;ref name="Durandin"/&gt;

===France===
In 1620 Descartes left the army. He visited [[Basilica della Santa Casa]] in Loreto, then visited various countries before returning to France, and during the next few years spent time in Paris. It was there that he composed his first essay on method: ''Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii'' ([[Rules for the Direction of the Mind]]).&lt;ref name="Durandin"/&gt; He arrived in [[The Hague|La Haye]] in 1623, selling all of his property to invest in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], which provided a comfortable income for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, William R., The Magic of Numbers and Motion, Science History Publications, U.S.A., 1991, pg. 94; Gaukroger, S.

===Netherlands===
[[File:Westermarkt 6, Descarteshuis (links).JPG|thumb|In [[Amsterdam]], Descartes lived on Westermarkt 6 (Descarteshuis, on the left).]]

Descartes returned to the Dutch Republic in 1628.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In April 1629 he joined the [[University of Franeker]], studying under [[Adriaan Metius]], living either with a Catholic family, or renting the [[Sjaerdemaslot]], where he invited in vain a French cook and an optician.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The next year, under the name "Poitevin", he enrolled at the [[Leiden University]] to study mathematics with [[Jacobus Golius]], who confronted him with [[Pappus's hexagon theorem]], and [[astronomy]] with [[Martin van den Hove|Martin Hortensius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]], ''Descartes: The Life of René Descartes and Its Place in His Times'', Simon and Schuster, 2006, pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1630 he had a falling-out with Beeckman, whom he accused of plagiarizing some of his ideas. In Amsterdam, he had a relationship with a servant girl, Helena Jans van der Strom, with whom he had a daughter, [[Francine Descartes|Francine]], who was born in 1635 in [[Deventer]]. She died of scarlet fever at the age of 5.

Unlike many moralists of the time, Descartes was not devoid of passions but rather defended them; he wept upon Francine's death in 1640.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durant |first=Will and Ariel |title=The Story of Civilization: Par VII, the Age of reason Begins |year=1961 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-671-01320-3 |page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Descartes said that he did not believe that one must refrain from tears to prove oneself a man." [[Russell Shorto]] postulated that the experience of fatherhood and losing a child formed a turning point in Descartes' work, changing its focus from medicine to a quest for universal answers.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Shorto, Descartes' Bones: A Skeletal History of the Conflict Between Faith and Reason {{ISBN|978-0-385-51753-9}} (New York, Random House, 14 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite frequent moves,&lt;ref&gt;While in the Netherlands he changed his address frequently, living among other places in Dordrecht (1628), [[Franeker]] (1629), Amsterdam (1629–30), [[Leiden]] (1630), Amsterdam (1630–32), Deventer (1632–34), Amsterdam (1634–35), [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] (1635–36), Leiden (1636), [[Egmond aan den Hoef|Egmond]] (1636–38), [[Santpoort]] (1638–1640), Leiden (1640–41), Endegeest (a castle near [[Oegstgeest]]) (1641–43), and finally for an extended time in [[Egmond-Binnen]] (1643–49).&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote all his major work during his 20-plus years in the Netherlands, where he managed to revolutionize mathematics and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;He had lived with [[Henricus Reneri]] in Deventer and Amsterdam, and had met with [[Constantijn Huygens]] and Vopiscus Fortunatus Plempius; Descartes was interviewed by Frans Burman at Egmond-Binnen in 1648. [[Henricus Regius]], [[Jan Jansz de Jonge Stampioen|Jan Stampioen]], [[Frans van Schooten]], [[Comenius]] and [[Gisbertus Voetius]] were his main opponents.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1633, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] was condemned by the [[Catholic Church]], and Descartes abandoned plans to publish ''[[The World (Descartes)|Treatise on the World]]'', his work of the previous four years. Nevertheless, in 1637 he published part of this work&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=103|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; in three essays: "Les Météores" (The Meteors), "[[Dioptrique|La Dioptrique]]" (Dioptrics) and "La Géométrie" (Geometry), preceded by an introduction, his famous ''Discours de la méthode'' (Discourse on the Method).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In it, Descartes lays out four rules of thought, meant to ensure that our knowledge rests upon a firm foundation.

{{Quote|The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt.}}In ''La Géométrie'', Descartes exploited the discoveries he made with [[Pierre de Fermat]], having been able to do so because his paper, Introduction to Loci, was published posthumously in 1679.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-de-Fermat|title=Pierre de Fermat {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later became known as Cartesian Geometry.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:René Descartes 1644 Principia philosophiae.jpg|thumb|''Principia philosophiae'', 1644]]

Descartes continued to publish works concerning both mathematics and philosophy for the rest of his life. In 1641 he published a metaphysics work, ''Meditationes de Prima Philosophia'' (Meditations on First Philosophy), written in Latin and thus addressed to the learned. It was followed, in 1644, by ''Principia Philosophiæ'' (Principles of Philosophy), a kind of synthesis of the ''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Meditations on First Philosophy''. In 1643, Cartesian philosophy was condemned at the University of Utrecht, and Descartes was obliged to flee to the Hague, and settled in [[Egmond-Binnen]].

Descartes began (through Alfonso Polloti, an Italian general in Dutch service) a long correspondence with [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], devoted mainly to moral and psychological subjects. Connected with this correspondence, in 1649 he published ''Les Passions de l'âme'' (Passions of the Soul), that he dedicated to the Princess. In 1647, he was awarded a pension by King [[Louis XIV of France]], though it was never paid.&lt;ref name="Descartes, René 2009"&gt;Descartes, René. (2009). Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica 2009 Deluxe Edition. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; A French translation of ''Principia Philosophiæ'', prepared by Abbot Claude Picot, was published in 1647. This edition Descartes also dedicated to Princess Elisabeth. In [[Principles of Philosophy#Preface to the French edition|the preface to the French edition]], Descartes praised true philosophy as a means to attain wisdom. He identifies four ordinary sources to reach wisdom and finally says that there is a fifth, better and more secure, consisting in the search for first causes.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, John J., Descartes.

By 1649, Descartes had become famous throughout Europe for being one of the continent's greatest philosophers and scientists.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; That year, [[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Queen Christina of Sweden]] invited Descartes to her court in to organize a new scientific academy and tutor her in his ideas about love. She was interested in and stimulated Descartes to publish the "[[Passions of the Soul]]", a work based on his correspondence with Princess Elisabeth.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Kurt |title=Descartes' Life and Works |work=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=Fall 2010 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-works/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes accepted, and moved to Sweden in the middle of winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=103–4|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a guest at the house of [[Pierre Chanut]], living on [[Västerlånggatan]], less than 500 meters from [[Tre Kronor (castle)|Tre Kronor]] in [[Stockholm]]. There, Chanut and Descartes made observations with a [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricellian]] barometer, a tube with [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Challenging [[Blaise Pascal]], Descartes took the first set of barometric readings in Stockholm to see if [[atmospheric pressure]] could be used in forecasting the weather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2009/alm09jun.htm Islandnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/modernmeteorolog00mete/modernmeteorolog00mete_djvu.txt Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes apparently started giving lessons to Queen Christina after her birthday, three times a week, at 5 a.m, in her cold and draughty castle. Soon it became clear they did not like each other; she did not like his [[Mechanical philosophy#Descartes and the mechanical philosophy|mechanical philosophy]], nor did he appreciate her interest in [[Ancient Greek]]. &lt;!--Mid January Christina left the city for three weeks.--&gt; By 15 January 1650, Descartes had seen Christina only four or five times.

==Philosophical work==
{{Further|Cartesianism}}

Initially, Descartes arrives at only a single first principle: I think. Thought cannot be separated from me, therefore, I exist (''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Principles of Philosophy''). Most famously, this is known as ''cogito ergo sum'' (English: "I think, therefore I am"). Therefore, Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting, therefore the very fact that he doubted proved his existence.  "The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence, that is in and of itself proof that he does exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten books: Chosen by Raj Persuade|publisher=The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]]|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/181/3/258}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two first principles—I think and I exist—were later confirmed by Descartes's clear and distinct perception (delineated in his Third Meditation): that I clearly and distinctly perceive these two principles, Descartes reasoned, ensures their indubitability.

Descartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks. But in what form? He perceives his body through the use of the senses; however, these have previously been unreliable. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a ''thinking thing''. Thinking is what he does, and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines "thought" (''cogitatio'') as "what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it". Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately [[Consciousness|conscious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=René |last=Descartes |year=1644 |title=The Principles of Philosophy (IX)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from [[dream argument|dreams]], and that one's mind cannot have been "hijacked" by an [[evil demon]] placing an illusory external world before one's senses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|And so something that I thought I was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind.}}

In this manner, Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge, discarding [[perception]] as unreliable and, instead, admitting only [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] as a method.&lt;ref name="Preface"/&gt;

===Dualism===

[[File:L'homme V00083 00000004.tif|thumb|''L'homme'' (1664)]]

Descartes, influenced by the [[automaton]]s on display throughout the city of Paris, began to investigate the connection between the mind and body, and how the two interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://people.whitman.edu/~herbrawt/classes/339/Descartes.pdf |title='A Brute to the Brutes?': Descartes' Treatment of Animals |last=Cottingham |first=John |author-link=John Cottingham |access-date=24 February 2018 |work=Whitman People |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main influences for [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] were [[theology]] and [[physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor=20013943|title=What Moves the Mind: An Excursion in Cartesian Dualism |last=Watson |first=Richard A. |author-link=Richard Watson (philosopher) |date=January 1982 |journal=[[American Philosophical Quarterly]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=73–81 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory on the dualism of mind and body is Descartes' signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced. Known as [[Cartesian dualism]] (or Mind-Body Dualism), his theory on the separation between the mind and the body went on to influence subsequent Western philosophies. In ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', Descartes attempted to demonstrate the existence of [[God]] and the distinction between the human soul and the body. Humans are a union of mind and body;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes’ Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=9781107729148|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus Descartes' dualism embraced the idea that mind and body are distinct but closely joined. While many contemporary readers of Descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp, he thought it was entirely straightforward. Descartes employed the concept of ''modes'', which are the ways in which substances exist. In ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'', Descartes explained, "we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it, whereas we cannot, conversely, understand the mode apart from the substance". To perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction,&lt;ref name="David Cunning 2014 278"&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes’ Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=9781107729148|pages=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Descartes explained as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention. Thus, when I consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is, I make a mental abstraction.&lt;ref name="David Cunning 2014 278"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Descartes two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other. Thus Descartes reasoned that God is distinct from humans, and the body and mind of a human are also distinct from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes’ Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=9781107729148|pages=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the great differences between body (an extended thing) and mind (an un-extended, immaterial thing) make the two ontologically distinct. But that the mind was utterly indivisible: because "when I consider the mind, or myself in so far as I am merely a thinking thing, I am unable to distinguish any part within myself; I understand myself to be something quite single and complete."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes’ Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=9781107729148|pages=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Meditations'' Descartes discussed a piece of [[wax]] and exposed the single most characteristic doctrine of Cartesian dualism: that the universe contained two radically different kinds of substances—the mind or soul defined as [[Thought|thinking]], and the body defined as matter and unthinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP USA|year=2013 |isbn=9780195380323|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] of Descartes' days held that the universe was inherently purposeful or theological. Everything that happened, be it the motion of the [[star]]s or the growth of a [[tree]], was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose, goal or end that worked its way out within nature. Aristotle called this the "final cause", and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated. With his theory on dualism Descartes fired the opening shot for the battle between the traditional Aristotelian science and the new science of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] which denied the final cause for explaining nature. Descartes' dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter and he expelled the final cause from the physical universe (or ''res extensa''). For Descartes the only place left for the final cause was the mind (or ''res cogitans''). Therefore, while Cartesian dualism paved the way for modern [[physics]], it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP USA|year=2013 |isbn=9780195380323|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes' dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings. A human was according to Descartes a composite entity of mind and body. Descartes gave priority to the mind and argued that the mind could exist without the body, but the body could not exist without the mind. In ''Meditations'' Descartes even argues that while the mind is a substance, the body is composed only of "accidents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP USA|year=2013 |isbn=9780195380323|pages=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he did argue that mind and body are closely joined:&lt;ref name="Georges Dicker 2013 303"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP USA|year=2013 |isbn=9780195380323|pages=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nature also teaches me, by the sensations of pain, hunger, thirst and so on, that I am not merely present in my body as a pilot in his ship, but that I am very closely joined and, as it were, intermingled with it, so that I and the body form a unit. If this were not so, I, who am nothing but a thinking thing, would not feel pain when the body was hurt, but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect, just as a sailor perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken.&lt;ref name="Georges Dicker 2013 303"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Descartes' discussion on embodiment raised one of the most perplexing problems of his dualism philosophy: What exactly is the relationship of union between the mind and the body of a person?&lt;ref name="Georges Dicker 2013 303"/&gt; Therefore, Cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the [[mind–body problem]] for many years after Descartes' death.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (online): Descartes and the Pineal Gland.&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes was also a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and believed in the power of [[Innatism|innate ideas]].&lt;ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 88"&gt;{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= SAGE|year=2010 |isbn=9781412973830|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes argued the theory of [[innate knowledge]] and that all humans were born with knowledge through the higher power of God. It was this theory of innate knowledge that later led philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) to combat the theory of [[empiricism]], which held that all knowledge is acquired through experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor=27532614 |title=John Locke's Contributions to Education |last=Baldwin |first=Bird T. |date=April 1913 |publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] |journal=[[The Sewanee Review]] |access-date=|volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=177–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes on physiology and psychology===
In ''The Passions of the Soul'' written between 1645 and 1646 Descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits. These animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles, and served as a metaphor for feelings, like being in high or bad spirit. These animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul, or [[passions]] of the soul. Descartes distinguished six basic passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy and sadness. All of these passions, he argued, represented different combinations of the original spirit, and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions. He argued, for example, that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body. In line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body, he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the [[pineal gland]] as connector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= SAGE|year=2010 |isbn=9781412973830|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland, through animal spirits. Thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits. He argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on God's will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them. But he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland, thus humans had to learn how to control their passions.&lt;ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 87"&gt;{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= SAGE|year=2010 |isbn=9781412973830|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events which influenced 19th-century [[reflex]] theory. He argued that external motions such as touch and sound reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits. Heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions, with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system, and in turn animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire.&lt;ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 87"/&gt; Through this chain of reactions the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process.&lt;ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 88"/&gt;

Above all he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation. He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was [[Divinity|divine]], thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous. Descartes' writings went on to form the basis for theories on [[emotion]]s and how [[Cognition|cognitive]] evaluations were translated into affective processes. Descartes believed that the brain resembled a working machine and unlike many of his contemporaries believed that mathematics and mechanics could explain the most complicated processes of the mind. In the 20th century [[Alan Turing]] advanced [[computer science]] based on [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]] as inspired by Descartes. His theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced [[Physiology|physiological theories]] more than 200 years after his death. The physiologist [[Ivan Pavlov]] was a great admirer of Descartes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= SAGE|year=2010 |isbn=9781412973830|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes' moral philosophy===
For Descartes, [[ethics]] was a science, the highest and most perfect of them. Like the rest of the sciences, ethics had its roots in metaphysics.&lt;ref name="Preface"/&gt; In this way, he argues for the existence of God, investigates the place of man in nature, formulates the theory of mind-body dualism, and defends [[free will]]. However, as he was a convinced rationalist, Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that we should seek, and [[virtue]] consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Nevertheless, the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge, because a well-informed mind will be more capable of making good [[choices]], and it also depends on mental condition. For this reason, he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body. He discussed this subject in the correspondence with [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], and as a result wrote his work ''The Passions of the Soul'', that contains a study of the [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] processes and reactions in man, with an emphasis on emotions or passions.&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;Blom, John J., Descartes. His moral philosophy and psychology. New York University Press. 1978. {{isbn|0-8147-0999-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works about human passion and emotion would be the basis for the philosophy of his followers (see [[Cartesianism]]), and would have a lasting impact on ideas concerning what literature and art should be, specifically how it should invoke emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Revolution A Brief History with Documents|last=Jacob|first=Margaret C.|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2009|isbn=0312653492|location=Boston|pages=16, 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans should seek the [[summum bonum|sovereign good]] that Descartes, following [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], identifies with virtue, as this produces a solid [[Blessing|blessedness]] or [[pleasure]]. For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that, in fact, this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that this good contributes to happiness but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.&lt;ref name="Blom"/&gt; The moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life, but earlier, in his ''Discourse on the Method'' he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. This is known as his [[Discourse on the Method#Part III: Morals, and Maxims accepted while conducting Method|"Provisional Morals"]].

=== Descartes on religious beliefs ===
[[File:Descartes3.jpg|thumb|right|René Descartes at work]]
In the third and fifth ''Meditation'', he offers an [[Ontological argument|ontological proof]] of a benevolent God (through both the ontological argument and [[trademark argument]]). Because God is benevolent, he can have some faith in the account of reality his senses provide him, for God has provided him with a working mind and [[Sensory nervous system|sensory system]] and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition, however, he finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction ''and'' perception. Regarding [[epistemology]], therefore, he can be said to have contributed such ideas as a rigorous conception of [[foundationalism]] and the possibility that [[reason]] is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. He, nevertheless, was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories.&lt;ref name="Preface"/&gt;

In his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' Descartes sets forth two proofs for God's existence. One of these is founded upon the possibility of thinking the "idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite," and suggests that "of all the ideas that are in me, the idea that I have of God is the most true, the most clear and distinct."&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, Rene "Meditations on First Philosophy, 3rd Ed., Translated from Latin by: Donald A. Cress&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic&lt;ref name="books.google.be" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KrR-5EKLSQMC p. 207" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gh_BAAAQBAJ p. 107" /&gt; and one of the purposes of the ''Meditations'' was to defend the Catholic faith. His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time, however: [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] regarded Descartes' views as rationalist and mechanist, and accused him of [[deism]]: "I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God," while a powerful contemporary, [[Martin Schoock]], accused him of [[Atheism|atheist]] beliefs, though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his ''Meditations''. The Catholic Church prohibited his books in 1663.&lt;ref name="Descartes, René 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward C. Mendler, ''False Truths: The Error of Relying on Authority, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
{{check quotation}}
Descartes also wrote a response to [[Philosophical skepticism|external world scepticism]]. Through this method of scepticism, he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information. In other words, certainty. He argues that sensory [[perception]]s come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the "propensity" to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true “substance”. But minds are substances, meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/|title=Descartes, Rene {{!}} Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes and natural science===
Descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Grosholz |first=Emily |title=Cartesian method and the problem of reduction |authorlink=Emily Grosholz |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2EtAVLU1eIAC&amp;pg=PA1 |isbn=0-19-824250-6 |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=But contemporary debate has tended to...understand [Cartesian method] merely as the 'method of doubt'...I want to define Descartes' method in broader terms...to trace its impact on the domains of mathematics and [[physics]] as well as [[metaphysics]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him the philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge, and expressed it in this way:&lt;ref name="Preface"&gt;{{cite web |last=Descartes |first=René |translator-last=Veitch |translator-first=John |url=http://www.classicallibrary.org/descartes/principles/preface.htm |title=Letter of the Author to the French Translator of the Principles of Philosophy serving for a preface |accessdate= 6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Thus, all Philosophy is like a tree, of which Metaphysics is the root, Physics the trunk, and all the other sciences the branches that grow out of this trunk, which are reduced to three principals, namely, Medicine, Mechanics, and Ethics. By the science of Morals, I understand the highest and most perfect which, presupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences, is the last degree of wisdom.}}
In his ''Discourse on the Method'', he attempts to arrive at a fundamental set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt. To achieve this, he employs a method called hyperbolical/metaphysical doubt, also sometimes referred to as [[methodological scepticism]]: he rejects any ideas that can be doubted and then re-establishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rebecca |last=Copenhaver |title=Forms of skepticism |url=http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050108095032/http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archivedate=8 January 2005 |accessdate=15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes built his ideas from scratch. He relates this to architecture: the top soil is taken away to create a new building or structure. Descartes calls his doubt the soil and new knowledge the buildings. To Descartes, Aristotle's foundationalism is incomplete and his method of doubt enhances foundationalism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/descartes-epistemology/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Newman|first=Lex|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes on animals===
Descartes denied that animals had reason or intelligence. He argued that animals did not lack sensations or perceptions, but these could be explained mechanistically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Animal Consciousness'', No. 2. Historical background| publisher=Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|date=23 December 1995|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-animal/#hist|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas humans had a soul, or mind, and were able to feel [[pain]] and [[anxiety]], animals by virtue of not having a soul could not feel pain or anxiety. If animals showed signs of distress then this was to protect the body from damage, but the innate state needed for them to [[Suffering|suffer]] was absent. Although Descartes' views were not universally accepted they became prominent in Europe and North America, allowing humans to treat animals with impunity. The view that animals were quite separate from humanity and merely [[machine]]s allowed for the maltreatment of animals, and was sanctioned in law and societal norms until the middle of the 19th century. The publications of [[Charles Darwin]] would eventually erode the Cartesian view of animals. Darwin argued that the continuity between humans and other species opened the possibilities that animals did not have dissimilar properties to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Charles Darwin: The Shaping of Evolutionary Thinking|author=Lance Workman |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|year=2013 |isbn= 9781137313232|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical impact==
===Emancipation from Church doctrine===
[[File:DescartesMeditations.png|thumb|Cover of ''Meditations'']]

Descartes has often been dubbed the father of modern [[Western philosophy]], the thinker whose approach has profoundly changed the course of Western philosophy and set the basis for [[modernity]].&lt;ref name="Russell2004p516"&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&amp;pg=PA516 ''History of western philosophy''] pp.511, 516–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger [1938] (2002), p. 76 quotation: {{quote|Descartes... that which he himself founded... modern (and that means, at the same time, Western) metaphysics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two of his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', those that formulate the famous [[Cartesian doubt|methodic doubt]], represent the portion of Descartes' writings that most influenced modern thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tad Schmaltz|Schmaltz, Tad M.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=pIYcUBCOrNgC&amp;pg=PA27 ''Radical Cartesianism: The French Reception of Descartes''] p.27 quotation: {{quote|The Descartes most familiar to twentieth-century philosophers is the Descartes of the first two ''Meditations'', someone proccupied with hyperbolic doubt of the material world and the certainty of knowledge of the self that emerges from the famous cogito argument.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that Descartes himself didn't realize the extent of this revolutionary move.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Wood Sellars]] (1949) [https://books.google.com/books?id=y1wNAAAAIAAJ ''Philosophy for the future: the quest of modern materialism''] quotation: {{quote|Husserl has taken Descartes very seriously in a historical as well as in a systematic sense [...] [in ''The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology'', Husserl] finds in the first two Meditations of Descartes a depth which it is difficult to fathom, and which Descartes himself was so little able to appreciate that he let go "the great discovery" he had in his hands.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In shifting the debate from "what is true" to "of what can I be certain?," Descartes arguably shifted the authoritative guarantor of truth from God to humanity (even though Descartes himself claimed he received his visions from God)—while the traditional concept of "truth" implies an external authority, "certainty" instead relies on the judgment of the individual.

In an [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] revolution, the human being is now raised to the level of a subject, an agent, an [[Emancipation|emancipated]] being equipped with autonomous reason. This was a revolutionary step that established the basis of modernity, the repercussions of which are still being felt: the emancipation of humanity from Christian [[revelation]]al truth and [[Catholic Church|Church doctrine]]; humanity making its own law and taking its own stand.&lt;ref name="Heidegger1938emancipated"&gt;Martin Heidegger [1938] (2002) ''The Age of the World Picture'' quotation: {{quote|For up to Descartes...a particular ''sub-iectum''...lies at the foundation of its own fixed qualities and changing circumstances. The superiority of a ''sub-iectum''...arises out of the claim of man to a...self-supported, unshakeable foundation of truth, in the sense of certainty. Why and how does this claim acquire its decisive authority? The claim originates in that emancipation of man in which he frees himself from obligation to Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine to a legislating for himself that takes its stand upon itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ingraffia95p126"&gt;Ingraffia, Brian D.

Swazo (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=INP_cy6Mu7EC&amp;pg=PA97 ''Crisis theory and world order: Heideggerian reflections''] pp.97–9&lt;/ref&gt; In modernity, the guarantor of truth is not God anymore but human beings, each of whom is a "self-conscious shaper and guarantor" of their own reality.&lt;ref name="Lovitt77pxxv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briton, Derek [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hd_xwb6EolMC&amp;pg=PA76 ''The modern practice of adult education: a postmodern critique''] p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In that way, each person is turned into a reasoning adult, a subject and agent,&lt;ref name="Lovitt77pxxv"&gt;Lovitt, Tom (1977) introduction to [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''The question concerning technology, and other essays'', pp.xxv-xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to a child obedient to God.

This anthropocentric perspective of Descartes' work, establishing human reason as autonomous, provided the basis for the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s emancipation from God and the Church. According to Martin Heidegger, the perspective of Descartes' work also provided the basis for all subsequent [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Heidegger19382002p75"&gt;Heidegger [1938] (2002), p. 75 quotation: {{quote|With the interpretation of man as ''subiectum'', Descartes creates the metaphysical presupposition for future anthropology of every kind and tendency.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes' philosophical revolution is sometimes said to have sparked modern [[anthropocentrism]] and [[subjectivism]].&lt;ref name="Russell2004p516"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Isadore Schwart [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wt4XDLEpjWYC&amp;pg=PA95 ''China and Other Matters''] p.95 quotation: {{quote|...&amp;nbsp;the kind of anthropocentric subjectivism which has emerged from the Cartesian revolution.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles B.

Descartes work has been used, in fact to inaugurates an entirely new kind of philosophy. Changing its total style, philosophy takes a radical turn: from naïve objectivism to transcendental subjectivism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematical legacy===
[[File:Cartesian coordinates 2D.svg|thumb|A Cartesian coordinates graph, using his invented ''x'' and ''y'' axes]]

One of Descartes' most enduring legacies was his development of [[analytic geometry|Cartesian or analytic geometry]], which uses algebra to describe geometry. He "invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', and knowns by ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''". He also "pioneered the standard notation" that uses [[Subscript and superscript|superscripts]] to show the powers or exponents; for example, the 2 used in x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to indicate x squared.&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes, ''Discourse de la Méthode'' (Leiden, Netherlands): Jan Maire, 1637, appended book: ''La Géométrie'', book one, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86069594/f383.image page 299.] From page 299: ''" ... Et ''aa'', ou ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, pour multiplier ''a'' par soy mesme; Et ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, pour le multiplier encore une fois par ''a'', &amp; ainsi a l'infini ; ... "'' ( ... and ''aa'', or ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, in order to multiply ''a'' by itself; and ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, in order to multiply it once more by ''a'', and thus to infinity ; ... )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Sorell, ''Descartes: A Very Short Introduction'' (2000). New York: Oxford University Press. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in our system of knowledge, using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning, particularly about abstract, unknown quantities. European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics, serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as [[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli]], [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardan]], [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and [[Lodovico Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Equations of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] higher than the third were regarded as unreal, because a three-dimensional form, such as a cube, occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity ''a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians, such as [[François Viète|Vieta]], who argued that it could represent only area. Although Descartes did not pursue the subject, he preceded [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in envisioning a more general science of algebra or "universal mathematics," as a precursor to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically, and mechanize general reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (1972). New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes' work provided the basis for the [[calculus]] developed by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and Leibniz, who applied infinitesimal calculus to the [[Tangent#Analytical approach|tangent line problem]], thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jan |last=Gullberg |authorlink=Jan Gullberg |year=1997 |title=Mathematics From The Birth of Numbers |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=0-393-04002-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Descartes' rule of signs|rule of signs]] is also a commonly used method to determine the number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial.

The beginning to Descartes' interest in physics is accredited to the amateur scientist and mathematician [[Isaac Beeckman]], who was at the forefront of a new school of thought known as [[mechanical philosophy]]. With this foundation of reasoning, Descartes formulated many of his theories on mechanical and geometrical physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/descartes-physics/|last=Slowik|first=Edward|title=Descartes' Physics|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Archive|date=22 August 2017|editor=Edward N. Zalta|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes discovered an early form of the law of conservation of mechanical [[momentum]] (a measure of the motion of an object), and envisioned it as pertaining to motion in a straight line, as opposed to perfect circular motion, as [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] had envisioned it. He outlined his views on the universe in his ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''.

Descartes also made contributions to the field of [[optics]]. He showed by using geometric construction and the [[law of refraction]] (also known as Descartes' law or more commonly [[Snell's law]]) that the angular radius of a [[rainbow]] is 42 degrees (i.e., the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbow's centre is 42°).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=P. A. and G. Mosca |year=2004 |title=Physics For Scientists And Engineers |publisher=W. H. Freeman |isbn=0-7167-4389-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also independently discovered the [[Specular reflection|law of reflection]], and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2008 |encyclopedia=Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555262/Rene_Descartes.html#s3 |title=René Descartes |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=15 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907142158/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555262/Rene_Descartes.html |archivedate=7 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Newton's mathematics===
Current opinion is that Descartes had the most influence of anyone on the young Newton, and this is arguably one of Descartes' most important contributions. Newton continued Descartes' work on cubic equations, which freed the subject from the fetters of the Greek perspectives. The most important concept was his very modern treatment of independent variables.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Newtonian Research'', edited by Z. Bechler, p. 109-129, ''Newton the Mathematician'', by Daniel T. Whiteside, Springer, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary reception===
Although Descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life, the teaching of his works in schools was controversial. Henri de Roy ([[Henricus Regius]], 1598–1679), Professor of Medicine at the University of Utrecht, was condemned by the Rector of the University, [[Gisbertus Voetius|Gijsbert Voet]] (Voetius), for teaching Descartes' physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cottingham |first=John |author-link=John Cottingham |first2=Dugald |last2=Murdoch |first3=Robert |last3=Stoothof |title=The Philosophical Writings of Descartes |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=T5cSfRS4m5QC&amp;pg=PA293 |chapter=Comments on a Certain Broadsheet |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1984 |page=293 |isbn=9780521288071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Principia philosophiae.tif|thumb|''Principia philosophiae'' (1685)]]

* 1618. ''Musicae Compendium''. A treatise on music theory and the aesthetics of music written for Descartes' early collaborator, Isaac Beeckman (first posthumous edition 1650).
* 1626–1628. ''Regulae ad directionem ingenii'' (''[[Rules for the Direction of the Mind]]''). Incomplete. First published posthumously in Dutch translation in 1684 and in the original Latin at Amsterdam in 1701 (''R. Des-Cartes Opuscula Posthuma Physica et Mathematica''). The best critical edition, which includes the Dutch translation of 1684, is edited by Giovanni Crapulli (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1966).
* 1630–1631. ''La recherche de la vérité par la lumière naturelle'' (''The Search for Truth'') unfinished dialogue published in 1701.
* 1630–1633. ''Le Monde'' (''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'') and ''L'Homme'' (''Man''). Descartes' first systematic presentation of his natural philosophy. ''Man'' was published posthumously in Latin translation in 1662; and ''The World'' posthumously in 1664.
* 1637. ''Discours de la méthode'' (''[[Discourse on the Method]]''). An introduction to the ''Essais'', which include the ''Dioptrique'', the ''Météores'' and the ''Géométrie''.
* 1637. ''[[La Géométrie]]'' (''Geometry''). Descartes' major work in mathematics. There is an English translation by Michael Mahoney (New York: Dover, 1979).
* 1641. ''Meditationes de prima philosophia'' (''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''), also known as ''Metaphysical Meditations''. In Latin; a second edition, published the following year, included an additional objection and reply, and a ''Letter to Dinet''. A French translation by the Duke of Luynes, probably done without Descartes' supervision, was published in 1647. Includes six [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Objections and replies|Objections and Replies]]. 
* 1644. ''Principia philosophiae'' (''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''), a Latin textbook at first intended by Descartes to replace the Aristotelian textbooks then used in universities. A French translation, ''Principes de philosophie'' by Claude Picot, under the supervision of Descartes, appeared in 1647 with a letter-preface to Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia.
* 1647. ''Notae in programma'' (''Comments on a Certain Broadsheet''). A reply to Descartes' one-time disciple Henricus Regius.
* 1648. ''La description du corps humain'' (''[[The Description of the Human Body]]''). Published posthumously by Clerselier in 1667.
* 1648. ''Responsiones Renati Des Cartes...'' (''Conversation with Burman''). Notes on a Q&amp;A session between Descartes and Frans Burman on 16 April 1648. Rediscovered in 1895 and published for the first time in 1896. An annotated bilingual edition (Latin with French translation), edited by Jean-Marie Beyssade, was published in 1981 (Paris: PUF).
* 1649. ''Les passions de l'âme'' (''[[Passions of the Soul]]''). Dedicated to Princess [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate]].
* 1657. ''Correspondance'' (three volumes: 1657, 1659, 1667). Published by Descartes' literary executor [[Claude Clerselier]]. The third edition, in 1667, was the most complete; Clerselier omitted, however, much of the material pertaining to mathematics.

In January 2010, a previously unknown letter from Descartes, dated 27 May 1641, was found by the Dutch philosopher Erik-Jan Bos when browsing through [[Google Search|Google]]. Bos found the letter mentioned in a summary of autographs kept by [[Haverford College]] in [[Haverford, Pennsylvania]]. The college was unaware that the letter had never been published. This was the third letter by Descartes found in the last 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vlasblom |first=Dirk |url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2492445.ece/Unknown_letter_from_Descartes_found |title=Unknown letter from Descartes found |newspaper=[[NRC.nl]] |date=25 February 2010 |access-date=30 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023903/http://vorige.nrc.nl/international/article2492445.ece/Unknown_letter_from_Descartes_found |archive-date=8 November 2016 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |language=nl |url=http://www.nrc.nl/wetenschap/article2491995.ece/Hoe_Descartes_in_1641_op_andere_gedachten_kwam |title=Hoe Descartes in 1641 op andere gedachten kwam |last=Vlasblom |first=Drik |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027192606/http://vorige.nrc.nl/wetenschap/article2491995.ece/Hoe_Descartes_in_1641_op_andere_gedachten_kwam |archive-date=27 October 2016 |newspaper=[[NRC.nl]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ripley Ville''' or '''Ripleyville''' was an estate of model houses for the working classes in [[Broomfields, Bradford|Broomfields]] in the [[East Bowling]] ward of the [[City of Bradford]] in [[West Yorkshire]], England.

Started in 1866 the development was built for the industrialist, politician and philanthropist [[Henry William Ripley]]. It was intended as a commercial development of model houses but when completed in 1881 had many aspects of an industrial [[model village]] – although residency was not limited to Ripley's employees. It was the only model village in the Borough of Bradford&lt;ref&gt;Saltaire was not incorporated into the City of Bradford until the 1970s&lt;/ref&gt; and can be compared with [[Akroydon]] in Halifax, built by Ripley's friend and schoolmate [[Edward Akroyd]], [[Saltaire]] and model housing schemes in other West Riding textile towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jowitt|1986}} includes descriptions of Saltaire, Copley, Ackroyden, West Hill Park, Wilshaw and Meltham Mills.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ripley Ville contained 196 workmen's cottages, a school and teacher's house, a church, allotment gardens and, on a separate site about a half-mile distant, a vicarage and ten almshouses which are still standing although all the other buildings had been demolished by 1970.

== Background ==

By the 1860s Ripley was managing partner of the Bowling Dye works, founded by his grandfather in 1808. In 1822 the dye works had relocated from West Bowling to a site in Spring Wood next to the Spring Wood Colliery pumping shaft – which supplied the works with steam and water. The works employed 18 men and boys. From 1835 as the junior partner Henry was "regarded as the boss of the dyehouse".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cudworth|1891|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; He built up the business to be the biggest dye works in Yorkshire. From the [[Bowling Iron Works]] he purchased the freehold of the dye works and about 100 acres of land surrounding it and subsequently built up the landholding to about 130 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cudworth|1891|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landholding added to the available water supply – "The whole of the water required for the supply of the works is an available source of 1,250,000 gallons per day". To the dye works income he had added income from several mills&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cudworth|1891|p=257}}: "the enterprise and forsight of the late Sir Henry Ripley who erected .. many large blocks wholly devoted to the worsted industry"&lt;/ref&gt; rented out on a "room and power" basis, from a water works (supplying 600,000 gallons per day) and a gas works. He was recognised as one of Bradford's "big four" industrialists alongside [[Titus Salt]], [[Samuel Lister]] and [[Isaac Holden]]. As a councillor, JP and public figure Ripley was deeply involved in the debates which engaged the recently (1847) incorporated borough council and its citizens.

After four decades of rapid economic and population growth Bradford had some of the worst housing and sanitary conditions in the UK and about the lowest life expectancy. A sanitary commissioner reported – "Taking the general condition of Bradford, I am obliged to pronounce it to be the most filthy town I visited."&lt;ref&gt;James Smith, Report on the Sanatory Condition of the Town of Bradford, Health of Towns Commission, 2nd Report, 1845, Vol. XVIII, Pt.2, p.315.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850 Titus Salt relocated his mills outside of the town and embarked on developing his model community at Saltaire. Bradford's Building and Improvement Committee reported in 1855 to the council "Your committee again beg to draw the attention of the Council and the public to the continued practice of building houses back-to-back. Out of 1401 sanctioned, 1070 or 76.9 per cent are laid out upon that objectionable principle.".&lt;ref&gt;George Sheeren.[[Back-to-back houses]] in Bradford. Bradford Antiquary 1986 in volume 2, pp. 47–53, of the third series.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradford council passed a series of building bylaws (1854, 1860, 1866 and 1870&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cudworth|1882}} – entries under the relevant years.&lt;/ref&gt; ) intended to ensure that new houses were of a decent standard. The bylaw of 1860 effectively banned construction of back to back houses which had been the predominant form of working class housing for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sheeran|1990|pp=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building interests mounted a campaign to have the bylaw rescinded, maintaining it was impossible to build "through" houses at a price that working-class people could afford and as evidence pointed to the precipitate fall in new building starts. In the elections of 1865 the chairman of the Building and Improvement Committee lost his seat and was replaced by a councillor more sympathetic to the building interests. In 1866 Bradford council issued a revised by-law which allowed construction of "back to backs" provided they met stringent requirements for space, ventilation, water supply and sanitary provision. These "tunnel backs" became Bradford's predominant form of working class houses during the next 20 years. The council approved no further plans for back to back houses after the 1870 bylaw but the builders had a sufficient stock of approvals to continue building them well into the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Caffyn|1986|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripley was not convinced by the arguments of the speculative builders. In November 1865 he issued a prospectus for the construction of 300 "Working-men's dwellings" on his own land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walker|2008|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were four-bedroom through houses with rear yards and front gardens and equipped with an internal WC. The houses were intended for sale to small landlords and owner occupiers with a provision for rental purchase and some renting. The Bradford firm Andrews and Pepper were appointed architects. The specification for the Ripley Ville houses was influenced by the proponents of model housing, such as J.Hole&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hole|1868}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Godwin, editor of "The Builder" and the practices of contemporary model builders in the West Riding. By the mid 1860s the views of the improvers had moved on from the provision of basic accommodation to considerations of lighting, ventilation, heating, storage, privacy and open space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Caffyn|1986|loc=chapter 8 "Improvement", pp. 82–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the Ripley Ville houses incorporated these enhanced standards, and in several respects exceeded them.

== Construction ==

Planning permission to build 254 houses was granted on 24 January 1866. Four invitations to tender appeared in the ''Bradford Observer'' – the first on 23 March 1866 and the fourth and final on 21 March 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walker|2008|pp=13–15}} sets out the planning approval and invitations to tender dates.&lt;/ref&gt; amounting in total to 200 houses. The reduction in the number of houses to be built in part reflected the decision to include a school. Planning approval for the school was given 8 June 1867.

All the houses were completed by early 1868 and the school was in use by autumn that year. Houses built under tenders 1 and 2 were completed with internal WCs in the cellar. A change of plan in spring 1867 led houses built under tenders 3 and 4 having external ash closets. Tenders 1 and 2 houses were retrofitted with external ash closets and the WCs removed. Reasons for the change remain obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Caffyn|1986|p=89}} reports that a plan for WC's in the Akroyden houses was dropped in view of the high water charges the Halifax Corporation demanded. Bradford Corporation bought Ripley's public supply water works in late 1866; this may have resulted in an increase in charges above the level Ripley's water works would have levied. The Corporation water works was desperately short of water in the 1860s and 1870s and discouraged the use of WC's. See {{harvp|Jowitt|Wright|1986|pp=144–146}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 1868 the Bradford Ten Churches Building Committee announced its intention to build its tenth church in Ripley Ville on land donated by Ripley.&lt;ref&gt;''Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser'', 14 December 1868 "Church building at Bradford". ''Leeds Mercury'' 12 December 1868 "Proposed New Church at Bowling"&lt;/ref&gt; T.H and F Healey who designed [[Holy Rood Church, Barnsley#Parish|Our Lady and St James Church]] in [[Worsbrough]] were appointed architects. St Bartholomew's Church was consecrated in December 1872. The architecture and townscape of Ripley Ville was complete and remained substantially unchanged until demolition a century afterwards. In 1875 a vicarage for the incumbent of St Bartholomew's was completed on land given by Ripley at the extreme southern boundary of his landholding. At that time it was a semi rural environment. In 1881 ten [[almshouse]]s were built at the cost of Ripley on a plot close to the vicarage. Six of the almshouses replaced almshouses built in 1857 on a site which had been partly taken over by the Thornton Railway.&lt;ref&gt;During construction the Thornton Railway Company was incorporated into the Great Northern Railway Company (GNR).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Site and architectural scheme ==

[[File:Ripley Ville location 1855.jpg|thumb|right| Ripley Ville – the surrounding landscape. OS map 1855 with developments to 1861]]

In 1865 more than 80 acres of Ripley's land holding were still undeveloped. The area was dotted with the Bowling Iron Company's former mine workings. Several old mine shafts had been converted to wells to provide the dye works with its soft water supply. Ripley Ville occupied most of the Broom Hall Estate: Broom Hall was a working farmhouse into the 1860s. The northern part of the estate had been acquired by the Great Northern Railway Company (GNR) to build the Bowling Curves that opened in 1867. The site chosen for Ripley Ville had the disadvantage being irregularly shaped with steep gradients. Its central street fell 40 feet over a distance of 300 feet but it was relatively free of old mine workings and contiguous to the urban development along Hall Lane which gave access to the town centre.

The site's gradients and the irregular shape determined the architectural scheme. Thirteen terraces of houses along four residential streets were laid out on a north–south axis. The outer streets, Vere Street and Ripley Terrace had houses on one side and full width carriageways. The internal Sloane and Saville Streets had 6&amp;nbsp;ft pedestrian walkways separating the front gardens. The cobbled back streets provided access for wheeled traffic and contained the mains services (water, gas, sewerage). Three streets on an east-west alignment (Ellen Street, Linton Street and Merton Street) provided access to the residential streets and locations for retail premises and public buildings.
[[File:Ripley Ville site map.jpg|thumb|right|Ripley Ville site map showing house types and retail premises]]
The development had 196 houses with three sizes of house, 25 of the largest Type 1 houses in two terraces, 140 of the intermediate Type 2 houses in nine terraces and 31 of the smallest Type 3 houses in two terraces. The front elevations, apart from a small difference in width, were identical for each type, and permitted a unified architectural scheme.

The church was completed four years after the houses and school by other architects and it seems that Andrews and Pepper's scheme anticipated a major building at this point. The impact of the completed scheme was dramatic, especially when viewed from the east. Ripley terrace was virtually level along its 750&amp;nbsp;ft length. The slight fall of about 4&amp;nbsp;ft was compensated for by building up gardens walls in the lower section so that doors and windows remained in alignment. Behind the south section of the terrace the school buildings rose above the house roofs with the pinnacle of the clock tower about 50 feet above the roof ridge of the houses. Behind the central and north sections of Ripley Terrace the roof lines of the successive terraces rose in echelon with the gable of St Bartholomew's rising 40 feet above the highest roofs. The pyramidical theme was repeated in the front elevations of the terraces.

[[File:Ripley Ville houses front elevations.jpg|thumb|right|Ripley Terrace front elevations Nos.1 to 11]]
Architectural punctuation of the terraces' front elevations was provided by tall gables to the terminal and central houses. In the north section the outer terraces had gables intermediate between the central and terminal houses. Different designs of gable window were used in different terraces. Left and right handed houses were used to provide symmetry. In a left-handed house the front door was to the left of the ground floor window. In a-right handed house it was to the right. The handedness changed in the centre of the terrace and was marked by a gable house. Between the gable house and its partner was a double chimney stack. Thus there were no chimney stacks on the terminal walls of the terrace and each terminal wall had a front door adjacent to it.

Externally the houses were of hammer-dressed Bradford stone set in black ash mortar with sills and lintels of sawn stone. Brick was used for internal walls and liners to external walls but was nowhere externally visible. House roofs were Welsh slate. Privies were of hammer dressed stone with Elland Flag roofs. Back yard walls were of hammer dressed stone, about 4&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;in high and with triangular capstones. Ripley Terrace and Vere Street front garden walls were about 3&amp;nbsp;ft high with broad rounded capstones surmounted by wrought iron railings. Gardens of the internal "front" streets had wrought iron railings of about 3&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;in height set on stone plinths and with wrought iron gates.
 [[File:Ripley Ville house plans and sections.jpg|thumb|right|Ripley Ville house plans and sections]]

All three types of house had two attic bedrooms, two first floor bedrooms and a cellar. Ground floor designs varied between the types.

Type 1 houses had a frontage of 16&amp;nbsp;ft 7 inches and a depth of 28 feet. They had two large ground floor rooms and a scullery in a back extension. The cellar was fitted out as a "cellar kitchen" with a sink and range. The cellar also contained a WC and a coal store.

Type 2 houses had a frontage of 15&amp;nbsp;ft 9" and a depth of 24 feet. They had a large front ground floor room and a smaller back room. The basement contained a storage cellar, WC in houses built under tenders 1 and 2 and coal store.

Type 3 houses had a frontage of 16&amp;nbsp;ft 7" and a depth of 20 feet. They had a single "through room" and small scullery on the ground floor. The basement contained a storage cellar, a coal store and a second enclosure. No WCs were fitted to type 3 houses, all of which were built under tenders 3 and 4.

All habitable rooms in the houses had gas lighting. The streets were gas lit supplied from Ripley's gas works in Mill Lane. All habitable rooms had a fireplace or range. In the bedrooms fireplaces were decorative cast iron. Type 1 houses had ranges in the back room and cellar kitchen and a polished slate fireplace in the ground floor front room. Type 2 houses had ranges in both ground floor rooms. Type 3 houses had a range in the single ground floor room.

Internal staircases from the ground floor were constructed of stone. Attic staircases were timber.The staircases were well lit by windows in the rear elevation. Cellars and back rooms had stone flagged floors, other floors were suspended timber

[[File:Ripley Ville houses rear elevations new.jpg|thumb|right|Ripley Ville houses rear elevations.]]
Front attic bedrooms were lit by casement windows in the dormer or on the case of gable houses a variety of decorative window designs. All other windows above ground apart from the back attic bedrooms of end of terrace gable houses, which had sky lights were double opening sashes of large size. Provision was made for built in storage. Cellars were fitted with stone shelves and three storage alcoves set into the wall. Living rooms had a cupboard mounted on a set of drawers. Walk in clothes closets were provided on the attic landings. In keeping with other Andrews and Pepper buildings all materials were of excellent quality and standards of workmanship and finish very high.

== Context ==
Discussion about the superiority of the Ripley Ville houses compared to the average working class houses of the time focused on the provision of WCs. In November 1866 Mr Gott, the corporation's chief engineer gave evidence to the Pollution of Rivers Commission.&lt;ref&gt;''Bradford Observer'', 22 November 1866. p6 col 1 "the Rivers Commission"&lt;/ref&gt; He said there were 26,000 houses in the town and 19,500 privies – of which 1,500 were WCs, 6,000 ash pits and 12,000 [[pail closet]]s.   Half of all houses, 13,000 in total, did not have sole use of a privy and WCs were installed in 5.7% of the total housing stock. WC's were a middle class preserve and virtually unknown in working class dwellings&lt;ref&gt;The Peadbody Islington Estate opened in 1865 had WCs. This may be the only example of provision of WCs in working class dwellings that predates Ripley Ville. The estate was of tenement blocks. Ten flats on each floor shared four WCs. For further details visit the Peabody Website at http://www.peabody.org.uk/media/2598/islington-archaeological-report-final-2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; – other than the houses being constructed in Ripley Ville.

A more useful comparator is habitable rooms per house and usable space in sq ft. The typical working class cottage built in the 1850s was a "one up and one down". The houses in Fig.4 in Hird Street (built c.1858, under the 1854 bylaw) are typical of this type- one is included in the table as a comparison with the Ripley Ville houses.

Also included is an example of tunnel back to backs which were built in large numbers in Bowling after the 1866 bylaw change. The tunnel gave access to the rear two houses and a group of four privies. Most such houses exceeded the bylaw minimum (the 1870 bylaw still permitted construction of the one up and one down) by including a side scullery and often a small front garden. In the example in the table the ground floor had a good size living room and a side scullery with access to the tunnel. Such houses had either two or three bedrooms, the third being in a flying free hold over the tunnel. Even the three-bedroom type was considerably smaller than the type 3 Ripley Ville house.

The type 1 and 2 Ripley Ville houses were comparable in size to the houses built at Saltaire for supervisors and managers and to contemporary lower middle class houses elsewhere.

It is difficult to judge how the example set by developers such as Ripley affected the standards of speculative builders. Writing in 1891 William Cudworth had no doubt about the beneficial impact of the improved dwellings movement over the longer term. "There can be no question that the housing of the operative classes is comparably better than it was fifty years ago. There is more provision for separate bedrooms.... The cottage of today with its wide streets and separate closets is a fair approach to sanitary perfection".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cudworth|1977|p=58}}; also quoted in {{harvp|Sheeran|1990|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Working class houses comparable in space and number of rooms to the Ripley Ville houses started to be built in Bowling from about 1895 and were built in large numbers between 1900 and 1914. From about 1906 they usually had a bathroom with a WC on the first floor.&lt;ref&gt;Cf 1891, 1903 and 1912 1:2500 OS maps of Bowling." My west Bowling" web site.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a transverse staircase as opposed to the longitudinal staircase in the Ripley Ville houses allowed access to a bathroom in addition to the rear bedroom. Retro fitting of bathrooms to the earlier houses of this type was accomplished by partitioning the rear bedroom. The transverse staircases were very steep compared to the Ripley Ville staircases and had no direct lighting. In most houses of this period attic bedrooms were lit only by skylights and did not have fireplaces. Although this type of house was comparable to the Ripley Ville houses of a half century earlier some aspects of the design were less satisfactory.

The 1911 census shows that the recently built houses were occupied by the upper stratum of the working classes with a high proportion of white collar workers and school teachers. The lower strata of the working classes had to await the building of council estates in the 1920s and 1930s to obtain three and four-bedroom houses with a bathroom and garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Caffyn|1986|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== School ==
[[File:Ripley Ville school north elevation.jpg|thumb|right| Ripley Ville school north elevation]]

The school building was financed by Ripley and run by the non-denominational [[British and Foreign School Society]] It was designed by Andrews Son and Pepper in a gothic revivalist style. The halls and classrooms were on a single level with service rooms in a basement. Internally the ground floor (total area 4,192 sq. ft.) was mainly taken up by two large halls of double height. The south hall of 1600 sq. ft. accommodated the girls primary school and the northern hall of 1300 sq. ft. accommodated the boys. Two smaller classrooms accommodated the infants.&lt;ref&gt;Use of spaces are shown on the deposit plan held at West Yorkshire Archives Bradford. Building plan reference 4473/1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Later photographic evidence suggests that the class room block as built varied from the plan. Instead of two unequally sized classrooms with an entrance lobby to the north there were two equally sized rooms separated by a centrally placed entrance lobby. The entrance door was beneath a gabled semi-dormer with a round window in the gable – very similar to the gables of the north façade.

The formal entrance to the school was through a carved and columned arched doorway on the ground floor of a very decorative clock tower. The tower was about 75&amp;nbsp;ft in height and had four clock faces – illuminated at night.

Each of the two play grounds had a pupils' entrance: junior girls and infants in the west and junior boys in the east. Boundary walls, gates and railings to the street frontages were similar to those of the workmen's cottages.

[[File:Ripely Ville school plans with compass.jpg|thumb|right| Ripley Ville school ground plan]]
The large halls were separated by sliding panels which could be drawn back to create a single space of about 2,900 sq ft. which was used for social events and public meetings. Contemporary press reports refer to the "fine and spacious hall" where "between four and five hundred people sat down to tea."

The teacher's house had three levels and apart from ornate external stone carving was similar in size and features to the workmen's cottages. The basement contained a storage cellar, pantry and space for a WC. As with the houses and school building it is not certain that any WC's were actually installed. The ground floor contained two living rooms, one with a sink, range and access to a private yard. An entrance hall opened to the stair hall. At the mezzanine landing of the stair was a door into the school corridor. On the first floor there were two bedrooms, each with a fireplace, and a smaller bedroom in the clock tower. Flues from the four fireplaces were carried to a single central chimney stack supported by an arch (hidden in the roof space) across the stair hall. This was unusual and expensive form of construction, but visually impressive.

Heating of the halls and classrooms was by coke stoves. In the 1880s Ripley's estates department converted the north hall for use as offices. A central heating boiler was installed in the basement and the coke stoves were replaced by radiators. Some features of the building prefigured, on a smaller scale, Andrews and Pepper's design for the grammar school in Manor Row (1872).

== St Bartholomew's Church ==

[[File:Ripley Ville church plan.jpg|thumb|right| Fig.10 Plan of St Bartholomew's church. ICBS archive, Lambeth]]

St Bartholomew's was the last church constructed under the Bradford Ten Churches building Campaign inspired by Charles Hardy, managing partner of the Low Moor Iron works and a leading Anglican layman. Ripley agreed to provide a site at no cost after he and Hardy had inspected it in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;''Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser''. 14 December 1868. "Church Building at Bradford"&lt;/ref&gt; The building cost in excess of £7,000, was largely met by donations from the Hardy family. The church contained a chapel with a window dedicated to the memory of Charles Hardy

In 1870 T. H and F. Healey were appointed architects. Planning permission was given in January 1871&lt;ref&gt;West Yorkshire Archives Bradford. Building Plan 6503/1-3, submitted 20 January 1871. The ground plan is identical to the As Built plan in ICBS archive.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Incorporated Church Building Society (ICBS) approved the design and a grant towards the cost. Site preparation works involving large-scale engineering started immediately. The foundation stone was laid at a service of dedication in April 1871 and the church was consecrated in December 1872. The bell turret was finished in 1874 when ICBS paid its grant towards the costs

The Memorial church of St Bartholomew's at Ripleyville.&lt;/ref&gt; ceremonies provide a detailed account of the architecture. The style was a simplified Early English. External masonry was Bradford stone and its roof was made of green Westmoreland slate. The churchyard had low stone walls with decorative wrought iron railings and gates. Internally the church walls were of pressed brick with moulded capitals to the columns and arches of polychrome brick – reportedly, "a very cheerful effect". Its 740 sittings were provided free.
The church occupied the dominant site in Ripley Ville and with the west gable apex 70&amp;nbsp;ft above street level the external appearance was very impressive. The architectural carving was executed by [[Charles Mawer]].&lt;ref name="YP &amp; LI 11 December 1872" &gt;[http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000686/18721211/096/0003 Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer - Wednesday 11 December 1872 p3 col3–5: Consecration of St Bartholomew's Church, Bradford]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vicarage and almshouses ==
[[File:Ripley Ville vicarage.jpg|thumb|right|St Bartholomew's vicarage c1880]]
The first vicar, Mr Rice, lived in a rented house at 22 Edmund Street which still exists. The parish, under the leadership of Ripley, decided a more permanent arrangement was needed. Ripley donated the site (0.406 acres) on New Cross Street about half a mile south of the church. The architects were T.H and F Healy who placed an invitation to tender in the ''Bradford Observer'' on 26 February 1874. The vicarage was completed in 1875, costing £2,050. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners provided £1,300 and the parish raised £750 from benefactions.&lt;ref&gt;''Leeds Mercury'', 25 August 1874 "Augmentation of Benefices"&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary press articles describe it as "on the scale of a "gentleman's residence" and as having "both day and night nurseries".&lt;ref&gt;George Sheeran in " Brass Castles", pages 8–17, analyses the relationships between social class, wealth, income and house size and design in Victorian Bradford. St Bartholomew's Vicarage can be classed as a villa of the "affluent". Chapter 3 "The Workings of the House" provides exemplar plans of similar houses to the vicarage. The section " A room for Everything" describes the social assumptions behind design decisions&lt;/ref&gt; No plans survive but from the large scale Ordnance Survey map its ground area can be measured as 2036 sq.ft compared with the 505 sq.ft. ground area of a type 1 Ripley Ville house.
[[File:Ripley Ville vicarage map.jpg|thumb|right| Ripley's alms houses and St Bartholomew's vicarage. 1908]]

By the late 1920s the vicarage was uneconomic. Vicars' salaries were insufficient for domestic servants and it may have been affected by mining subsidence.(The adjacent Durston's House was demolished about that time.) It was sold to a property developer who demolished and replaced it with a row of houses by 1931. The parish took the lease of a detached house at 205 Hall Lane until 1942 when on amalgamation of the St Luke's parish with St Bartholomew's the former St Luke's vicarage in Caledonia Street became available. Both the vicarages were early-19th century houses of elegant classical design. The Caledonia Street house had been built for a local mill owner in 1834

In 1881 Ripley paid for ten almshouses in New Cross Street a short distance from the vicarage. Six replaced alms houses built in 1857&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cudworth|1891|pp=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; by his parents near their house, Bowling Lodge. The old almshouses site had been partly taken over by the GNR line from Ripleyville to Thornton. The commemorative plaque of 1857 was re-affixed to the new almshouses which are grade II listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1132972|desc=Bowling Dyeworks Almshouses – 9/885 II|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect was James Ledingham&lt;ref&gt;James Ledingham, 1849–1926. Born Aberdeen. Articled to A &amp; W Reid of Elgin and Inverness in 1864. Assistant to Andrews &amp; Pepper, Bradford 1870 to 1880. Commenced independent practice in 1880, initially at 53 Market Street, later at 1 New Ivegate. Passed RIBA qualifying exam in 1884; admitted ARIBA 1885 elevated to FRIBA 1892. He enjoyed a prosperous practice in Bradford, particularly in Manningham.&lt;/ref&gt; who had worked as an assistant to Andrews and Pepper.

Plans deposited by Ledingham&lt;ref&gt;West Yorkshire Archive, Bradford. Bradford Building Plan 11110/1-4&lt;/ref&gt; show that each house had a ground area of about 350 sq. ft.(the projecting end of terrace houses were slightly larger) with a frontage of about 18&amp;nbsp;ft. On the ground floor front was a living room containing a range. To the rear was a scullery with a sink and access to a back yard containing an ash house, coal store and a gate to a service road. On the first floor front was a bedroom with a fireplace and walk in wardrobe. On the mezzanine level was a WC.

The relative isolation of the area where the vicarage and almshouses were built was greatly reduced in 1881 when the GNR opened Bowling Junction station, about 50 yards distant from the almshouses. It had services to Bradford (about 5 minutes journey time), Leeds, Halifax and Wakefield.

Occupancy of the almshouses was not limited to former Ripley employees but was open to all old residents of Bowling. Occupants received an allowance of 3/- per week.

== Retail premises ==

Six end terrace houses adjoining Linton Street and two adjoining Ellen street were retail premises at the time of the 1871 census. All except No 2 Vere Street continued in commercial use until demolition. Architectural and structural changes were in most cases carried out at the time of construction.

Ripley would not allow the sale of beer in Ripley Ville – although the 1872 Smith's Directory records Stephen Gibson of No 2 Linton Street as a grocer, tea dealer and beer retailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bradford Directory|2009|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially there was no public house but residents could drink at the Locomotive Inn (which predated Ripley Ville) at No 7 Ellen Street or in Hall Lane at the Bowling Hotel or any of the four beer retailers recorded there in Smiths Directory.

During the 1870s the shop at No 2 Linton Street was joined to the adjacent house (40 Saville Street) and modifications undertaken. The 8-bedroom building was run by Mrs Gibson as a shop and coffee tavern and probably a temperance hotel. In the 1890s (after Ripley's death) Benjamin Spenser&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Spencer was reported in the 1901 census as "grocer and beerseller" at "38 and 40 Linton Street"&lt;/ref&gt; obtained a beer license. Under the name Gibson Hotel it continued as the village pub until demolition.

In 1874 the Co-op opened a store at No 10 Ellen Street replacing temporary store at No 5 Ellen Street. Branch 11 was an imposing building and continued trading until demolition in 1960.

== Early history ==

Ripley's expectations for the model development were not fully met. He had intended the houses should be for outright purchase – but very few, mainly the end terrace houses adapted for retail use, were purchased outright. A scheme for rental purchase was abandoned because of low take up. Most of the houses were offered for rent but the take up was slow. Ripley's political opponents accused him of charging exorbitant rents.&lt;ref&gt;''Bradford Observer'', 4 November 1868 "Election Intelligence"&lt;/ref&gt; The 1871 census returns bears out the slow take up and high rent levels. In one terrace of 13 houses 7 were unoccupied. Overall 17 of the 196 properties were unoccupied and 24 were in multiple accommodation.

In 1868 the building society movement was still in its infancy. Caffyn&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Caffyn|1986|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes – "By the late 19th century many building societies' requirements excluded less affluent workers from membership. Borrowers from the Bradford Equitable Building society and the Freehold Land Society for example, were largely foremen, clerks, school-masters, shopkeepers and the like.." Only in the first decade of the 20th century were significant numbers of working-class people in south Bradford able obtain a mortgage for house purchase

The ''Bradford Observer'' gave an impression of an active community life in Ripley Ville. Cricket and football teams were successful in local leagues. Meetings and other events took place in the school hall on a regular basis. There are reports of teas and tea evenings, usually with Ripley hosting the event and making a speech. The opening of the Co-op store was marked by an event at Ripley Ville school.&lt;ref&gt;''Bradford Observer'' 28 March 1874 Page 3 "The New Co-operative store at Ripleyville"&lt;/ref&gt; Speeches were made by officers of the Bradford Industrial Society and by the Rev A.B Cunningham, a travelling lecturer of the University Extension Movement.&lt;ref&gt;Crockford's Clerical Directory 1896 lists Dr.A.B Cunningham as Vicar of Great St Mary's Cambridge (the University Church), Rural Dean of Cambridgeshire and Fellow of Trinity College)&lt;/ref&gt; Other meetings were held to raise money for the vicarage and church organ, and to celebrate its installation in 1878. In 1881 when it was announced that the parish of St Bartholomew's had a debt of £800, Ripley led the fund raising campaign and it was paid off in months. The tone of press reports show Ripley greatly enjoying himself as leader of his new community

The Thornton Railway, of which Ripley was an enthusiastic proponent, opened in 1878 with a station, St Dunstan's, in Ripley Ville. The following year the line was extended to Halifax and in 1883 to Keighley. Ripley Ville was a node on the expanding rail network.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Richardson|1976|pp=56–59, esp. Fig. 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; With services to Bradford, Leeds, Halifax, Wakefield and intermediate villages and suburbs the station expanded commercial and job opportunities for the residents.

A main sewer from The Roughs to central Bradford was completed by Bradford Corporation. The Ripley Ville sewer system, installed 1866-8 but out of use following the change of plan over WCs, was connected to it. Subsequently the external ash closets of the Ripley Ville houses were converted to WCs.

Sir Henry Ripley (knighted in 1881) died in early 1882. His younger son, also Henry, succeeded him as manager of the dye works. After his death most of Sir Henry's property, including the Ripley Ville estate, was administered by a body of trustees. The junior school ceased to operate in the early 1880s when the Board School took its pupils. Ripley's trustees and their estates office moved into the junior school accommodation. The infants school continued until just before the First World War. Its premises continued in use as a parish hall and village social centre until after the Second World War.

Successive census results give a picture of a prosperous and stable community. Ripley had achieved his aim of providing houses for the working classes but the census returns of 1881 and 91 show that the residents represented the upper stratum of working class occupations. White collar occupations were well represented, especially in the type 1 houses of Vere Street. Skilled craftsmen and self-employed tradesmen were numerous, with the construction and engineering trades well represented. Some residents had become members of the middle classes. Edward Wright of no. 83 Ripley Terrace, described in earlier censuses as a master mill-right, engineer and employer of labour, is described in later censuses as the owner of an engineers' tool supply company.

== Subsequent history ==

In 1899 ownership and control of the dye works passed to the newly created Bradford Dyers Association. Members of the Ripley family ceased to have any personal relationship with Ripley Ville.

In 1896 the Midland Railway obtained an act of Parliament authorising it to build a through railway from its main line at Royston to connect with its existing tracks at Bradford Foster Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thornhill|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed line of railway passed under Ripley Ville. The Midland's cash offer of £6,000 for the purchase of Ripley property was unacceptable to the Ripley Trust who also felt that there was a direct threat to the soft water supply to the dye works. An Arbitration hearing in 1900&lt;ref&gt;''Birmingham Daily Post'' 1 May 1900 "Heavy Arbitration Award"&lt;/ref&gt; awarded the Ripley Trust £14,000 for 3 acres of land in Ripley Ville. This included 4 terraces of houses and a strip of land across Ladywell Fields. After another Act of Parliament in 1912 and several changes of plan the Midland Railway decided, in the changed economic circumstances after the Great War, to abandon the scheme. Bradford Corporation (who were wholly in favour of the scheme and deeply regretted its abandonment) agreed to buy all the land acquired by the Midland. This included, in addition to much land in the centre of the city, the four terraces of houses in Ripley Ville and Ladywell fields. Ladywell Fields were designated as a public park. Management of the four terraces of houses passed to the Borough's housing department.

With control of Ripley Ville rented houses divided between Ripley's Trustees and the Corporation there were no co-ordinated attempts to upgrade and modernise the estate. Both landlords followed a policy of minimum maintenance. Ripley's Trustees undertook no external painting after about 1920. Linton Street and Merton Street remained un-adopted. They had never been paved other than with a scattering of blast furnace slag. Vere Street, Ellen Street and the back streets had cobbled carriageways and flagged pavements and remained in a fairly decent state. The council "tarmaced" Ripley Terrace when it became a bus route.

[[File:Ripley Ville house fronts 1956.jpg|thumb|right| Fig.15 Vere Street houses 1958]]
There was no electricity supply to the houses until 1938 when supply cables were laid by the municipal power authority. Ripley's Trustees required tenants to contribute to the cost of connection (£60 in 1958) so take up was slow. Some houses still used gas lighting in the 1960s. By that time the estate had a very neglected appearance. Removal of the iron gates and railings "for the war effort" in 1941 had made maintenance of front gardens very difficult – especially in the internal rows where there were no garden walls.

Under the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, Bradford Corporation adopted "The Bradford Development Plan" in 1951. (Mainly authored by Stanley Wardley, the city's Chief Engineer) The plan envisaged large scale demolition of 19th-century houses in Bowling and redevelopment for "light industrial" use. In the late 1950s the Corporation's demolition program approached Ripley Ville. By 1958 the houses in Hird Street and most of those in Hall Lane had been demolished. The Ellen Street co-op and St Bartholomew's church had been demolished by 1962. In 1970 the Ripley Ville houses and School were demolished and the site levelled for redevelopment. There were few protests and no mention of the desirability of preserving an historical and architectural heritage.

== 21st century ==

[[File:Ripley Ville Locations on Open Street Map.jpg|thumb|right| Fig.16 Ripley Ville locations 2014]]

Apart from minor changes the pattern of land use on Ripley's land holdings and the built environment established at the time of Henry Ripley's death continued into the 1960s and until the demolition of Ripley Ville in 1970. Subsequently Ripley's dye works and mills have also been demolished and redeveloped and previously undeveloped land has been built on. In recent years (2014) even some major railway engineering features have been obliterated and it is now difficult to see how former land use relates to the modern landscape. Fig.16 shows some of the earlier features superimposed on a recent (2014) street map.

== Sources of information ==

Unlike his contemporaries Titus Salt and Samuel Cunliffe Lister, Henry William Ripley had no biographer. Information about Ripley and Ripley Ville must be drawn from a wide range of sources. Principal sources are listed in the bibliography. Some must be treated with caution.

Henry William Ripley and his model village of Ripley Ville were well covered by contemporary press articles. Bradford had a very active local press at that time. Rhodes "Bradford Past and Present" provides a history and list of publications to 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rhodes|1890|pp=57–70}}: "The Bradford Newspapers"&lt;/ref&gt; The article is anonymous but the author was probably William Cudworth. The ''Bradford Observer'' in particular is a very rich source of comments and reports.&lt;ref&gt;David James "William Byles and the Bradford Observer" in "Victorian Bradford" (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; Digitised copies are available on the British Newspaper Archive website. Copies of other local publications are held at Bradford Library.

The various works of the local historian and reporter William Cudworth, a younger contemporary of Ripley, are also a valuable source of information. In the "History of Bowling" he provides an account of the geology and mining history of the area and describes the deepening of former pumping shafts to the Rough Rock level to tap the soft water aquifer. He provides a history of the dye works and in his references to Ripley Ville gives details of the rental purchase scheme and its abandonment. However, the usually reliable Cudworth misdates".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cudworth|1891|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; the building of Ripley Ville to 1863–4 – an error perpetuated by some later authors.

Cudworth's "Historical Notes on the Bradford Corporation " provides an account of the development of water and sewage works and the building by-laws.

Few publications between Cudworth's death and the 1970s dealt directly with Ripley, Ripley Ville or the history of Bowling and for this period newspaper reports are the principal source of information. The "Centenary Yearbook" (1947) records that Bradford's sewage treatment problems were not properly solved until completion of the Esholt scheme in the early years of the 20th century and that the water supply problems continued until completion of the Nidderdale scheme in the inter war years.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford Centenary Yearbook, "Water Supply" and "Better Sanitation"&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1982 David Wright noted&lt;ref&gt;"J.A. Jowitt and D. Wright(editors) "Victorian Bradford" page 1&lt;/ref&gt; in the Introduction to "Victorian Bradford" that "Although Bradford produced some eminent historians of the city in the Victorian age, its history during the first half of the twentieth century remained sunk in a mass of antiquarianism and neglect. Only on the last fifteen years or so has there appeared a significant and fruitful crop of academic historical studies". These studies from about 1970 were often inspired by Jack Reynolds of the University of Leeds or sponsored by Bradford Library and the recently (1966) chartered Bradford University.

The unpublished dissertation by Derek Pickles shows that the eastern and southern boundaries of Ripley's landholding followed the lines of former coal tramways, and that Ripley Road which bisected the dye works was also a tramway route. Richardson's "Geography of Bradford" (1976) provides a modern spatial analysis and shows the impact of earlier transport and mining features on the location of subsequent industrial and residential developments. A paper "All Change" (1986) presented to the Bradford Society of Antiquaries describes how the Midland Railway Company's scheme for a through line led to divided ownership of the Ripley Ville estate.

Publications by Caffyn, Sheeran and Jowitt (1986– 1990) deal directly with workers houses in the 19th century. They provide many house plans, photographs and descriptions. They also describe the works of "model builders" and the aims of the "model housing" movement. All make reference to Ripley Ville but include no plans or photographs. Cafin's remit from the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments was to record extant buildings so such an absence is understandable: Ripley Ville had been demolished twenty years before the time of her survey. Sheeran and Jowitt probably had no good documentary evidence available. The location of Andrews and Pepper's archive, if it still exists, is unknown. The plans included in Ripley's prospectus and planning applications (Deposit Plans) held at Bradford library are no more than rough sketches. Absence of evidence may also account for the incorrect statements by Koditschek"&lt;ref&gt;Koditschek. Class Formation and Urban Industrial Society in Bradford Page 433.&lt;/ref&gt; – that

"Ripley built 300 cottages to sell on mortgage to his workers.......When it became clear that the model dwellings were beyond the means of the majority of workers, a less ambitious scheme was implemented, providing cheaper units only marginally superior to existing housing in other working-class districts..... Ripley Ville disappeared as a distinctive community and remained only a name on a map"

In 2008 R.L Walker published a well researched booklet "When was Ripley Ville Built?". The booklet finally laid to rest Cudworth's incorrect dating. Using documents and copies of newspapers held at Bradford Library Walker established the dates and contents of Ripley's prospectus for the Ripley Ville houses, the grant of planning approval and issues of invitations to tender by Andrews and Pepper. This placed Ripley's initiative firmly in the context of the "bylaw revolt" and 1865 local elections. The expansion of the scheme to include a school and church were placed in the context of Henry Ripley's transition from local to national politician. One of the first events in the school (reported in the ''Bradford Observer'') was a meeting in support of Ripley's candidature in the 1868 parliamentary election.

In 2011 R.L Walker established a website "Rediscovering Ripley Ville". The site has stimulated interest in the history of Ripley Ville and the dye works. Several of the "guest posts" are by former residents of Ripley Ville, who have provided copies of rare photographs. Some former residents had retained survey notes and measured drawings of the houses – details of which have been posted on the site. These are the source of the plans and section drawings shown in Fig. 6.

Another local history website "My West Bowling" has photographs of Ripley Ville and the surrounding area. The site also contains a series (1891–1934) of large scale (1:2500) Ordnance Survey Maps, available for viewing or download. These maps were marked up by Smith, Gotthard &amp; Co. Land Agents and Surveyors to show land ownership boundaries (including Ripley's landholdings) and ownership changes. The 1911 maps are marked up to show the Midlands's through railway scheme described in "All Change".

Records and papers of Ripley' Dye Works and Ripley's Trustees are held at the West Yorkshire Archive, Wakefield. The WYA site provides an on line index to the collection

'''Rooigrond''' is a town in [[ Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality]] in the [[North West (South African province)|North West]] province of [[South Africa]].

Hamlet 16 km south-east of [[Mafikeng]] and 25 km south-west of [[Ottoshoop]]. Afrikaans for ‘red ground’. The place was formerly known as Vrywilligersrus and Heliopolis. Part of the region Rooigrond, ceded to Boer volunteers under [[Adriaan de la Rey]] by Tswana chiefs in the 1880s, became the republics of [[State of Stellaland|Stellaland]] and [[State of Goshen|Goshen]].&lt;ref name=dsapn&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary of Southern African Place Names (Public Domain)|url=https://archive.org/details/DictionaryOfSouthernAfricanPlaceNames|publisher=Human Science Research Council|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rooigrond served as capital of the [[State of Goshen]] from 1882 to 1883.

The '''Small Carpathian Museum''' (aka ''Little Carpathian Museum'') in [[Pezinok]], [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]], is a local museum with an emphasis on wine making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.sk/default.php?obj=muzeum&amp;ix=mkm |title=Malokarpatské múzeum v Pezinku /* Little&amp;nbsp;– Carpathian Museum in Pezinok /Muzeum.SK&amp;nbsp;– múzeum, galéria, hrad, zámok/ |publisher=Muzeum.sk |date=2011-09-23 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The museum was reopened to the public on 18 November 2008 after two years of renovation. By using [[European Union]] funds and funds from the founder, the Bratislava self-governing region, the museum’s building has undergone a complete reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitslovakia.com/small-carpathian-museum-pezinok/&lt;/ref&gt;  The institution is being shaped as a regional museum with a strong accent on viticulture, grape growing and notably wine from the Small [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Carpathia]]n viticulture region.

The museum features a tour of the cellar exposition with the biggest collection of viticulture presses in [[Europe]], temporary exhibitions on various topics, workshops for schools and Small Carpathian wine tasting in the unique premises of the museum. It is one of the organisers of the St. Urban event, the Richard Réti Memorial international chess tournament, the Ceramic market and it is one of the stops during the Open Cellar Day on the Small Carpathian Wine Road. Together with the civic association Museum Vinorum, it is an organiser of the Pezinok Wine Cellars. The museum also organises temporary exhibitions abroad (e.g., the Vinohrady, wine and people exhibition presented in September 2005 in the [[European Parliament]] in [[Strasbourg]] and later in [[Vienna]] and [[Milotice]], [[Czech Republic]]).

The institution has its own sommelier along with professional employees and technical staff.

== Facilities ==
=== Tour of the cellar exposition ===
The exposition is focused on introducing viticulture and grape growing in the region of the Small Carpathians using multimedia as a modern communication means. After consulting professionals, a friendly application of modern design elements in the ancient cellar premises was used, however only in those cases where it did not interfere with the atmosphere and character of the area.

The tour uses light, sound, tasting, and other interactive activities. There is an aroma bar where it is possible to smell typical local wine. The exposition includes the biggest collection of wine presses in Central Europe.

=== Tasting Small Carpathian wines ===
At the end of the exposition tour, there is a tasting of cultivar wines of the Small Carpathian region in the cellar premises.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11630">The '''Syrian Crisis of 1957''' was a period of severe diplomatic confrontations during the [[Cold War]] that involved [[Syrian Republic (1946–63)|Syria]] and the Soviet Union on one hand, and the United States and its allies, including Turkey and the [[Central Treaty Organization|Baghdad Pact]], on the other.

The tensions began in August 18,{{sfn|Brecher|1997|pp=345-346}} when the Syrian government presided by [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] made a series of provocative institutional changes, such as the appointment of Col. [[Afif al-Bizri]] as chief-of-staff of the Syrian Army, who was alleged by Western governments of being a Soviet sympathizer. Suspicion that a communist takeover had occurred in Damascus grew larger, prompting neighboring Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon to consider supporting an Arab or Western military intervention to overthrow the Syrian government. Turkey was the only country to step in by deploying thousands of troops along the Syrian-Turkish border. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] threatened that he would launch missiles at Turkey if it attacked Syria, while the United States said that it could attack the Soviet Union in response to an assault on Turkey. The crisis ended in late October, when Turkey agreed to cease its border operations following pressure by the United States,{{sfn|Yaqub|2011|pp=114-116}} and when Khrushchev made an unexpected visit to the Turkish embassy in Moscow.{{sfn|Brecher|1997|pp=345-346}} Eisenhower approved a CIA-MI6 plan to stage fake border incidents as an excuse for an invasion by Syria's pro-Western neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/sep/27/uk.syria1|title=Macmillan backed Syria assassination plot|first=Ben|last=Fenton|date=September 27, 2003|website=The Guardian|access-date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events are widely seen as a major failure of the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], which stressed that the United States could intervene militarily on behalf of a Middle Eastern ally to fight "international communism".{{sfn|Yaqub|2011|pp=114-116}}

==Events==
The crisis began in mid-August, when the Syrian government made a series of important moves, furthering the idea that communists were in control of Damascus. Such changes included the replacement of [[Tawfik Nizam al-Din]] by Col. [[Afif al-Bizri]] as chief-of-staff of the Syrian Army. The latter was suspected by Western governments of being a pro-Soviet [[fellow traveller]]. This came four days after Syria expelled three American diplomats who were accused by Damascus of plotting to overthrow the government.{{sfn|Anderson|1995|pp=25}}

President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s special envoy to the Middle East, [[James P. Richards]], warned about moving too fast and believed that the tensions could "change character and ease off in a few days or weeks", following Anglo-American talks in response to the incidents. US Secretary of State, [[John Foster Dulles]], described the situation as "totally unacceptable" and called for further efforts to prevent Syria from becoming a "Soviet satellite". He had hoped, however, that a violent response to the developments would be prevented, especially by Israel. On August 21, as advised by Dulles, Eisenhower made unclear statements on the events during a press conference, without alleging that the Syrian government was communist-controlled. Syria responded with another press conference two days later, stating that Damascus was committed to "positive neutralism", a foreign policy doctrine that stressed independence from the "paternalism" of the Cold War superpowers.{{sfn|Anderson|1995|pp=25}}

|style="text-align: left;"|"Time approaching, if indeed not already arrived, when Syria will cease be effectively an independent nation but will have been taken over as was Czechoslovakia in 1948 and made into Soviet satellite having independence only in name and not in substance. We also convinced that once present group now in control Damascus has consolidated its position in Syria it will reach out in efforts subvert surrounding countries, thus propagating Communist virus and paving way for control by elements subservient to Moscow."

|}

By the end of August, both Washington and London were convinced that Syria was no longer on the non-aligned camp, and that something had to be done in order to prevent the subverting of neighboring countries. In a letter to Dulles on August 28, British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] described Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] as "a more dangerous man even than Stalin", and further stressed the importance of taking action so that neighboring Lebanon, Jordan, and eventually Iraq don't fall under the Soviet sphere of influence. The same day, British ambassador to Jordan, [[Charles Hepburn Johnston]], said that the Jordanian government was aware of anti-government cells within Syria that it considered arming, but then gave up the idea and decided to wait for further developments. At the end of the month, Eisenhower sent [[Loy W. Henderson]] as a special envoy to the Middle East, who was to work out a solution to the crisis by consulting different involved governments, all except the Syrian government.{{sfn|Anderson|1995|pp=26}}

On September 2, Secretary Dulles said during a press conference in Washington, that all the countries bordering Syria were of the opinion that Syria would become a communist state if nothing had been done within the next 60 days. This came after Henderson delivered Eisenhower a report from his visit to the Middle East.{{sfn|Anderson|1995|pp=28}} It also followed a series of important diplomatic exchanges between officials from different countries, during which it was revealed that Israel was willing to take military action, unless other countries neighboring Syria decided to "seal off" the country, which was discussed in the beginning of September during a meeting in [[Ankara]] between Turkish Prime Minister [[Adnan Menderes]], Iraqi Crown Prince [['Abd al-Ilah]] and the American ambassador in Turkey. Israel was eventually pressured by the West to show restraint and not to react. 'Abd al-Ilah was cautious, as he wanted to consult Jordan first before making any move. A penetration of Syrian territory through Jordan appeared like an "easier" plan to him than through the Iraqi-Syrian border.{{sfn|Anderson|1995|pp=27}} Turkey, however, was willing to adopt military measures, since it viewed the situation as a matter of its national security.{{sfn|Anderson|1995|pp=28}}

'''Thomas Richards''', MA, D.Litt., F.R.Hist.S (15 March [[1878 in Wales|1878]] &amp;ndash; 24 June [[1962 in Wales|1962]]) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] historian, author and librarian.

Richards was born at Tal-y-bont, [[Ceredigion|Cardiganshire]], and was nicknamed "Doctor Tom". He studied history at the University College of North Wales (now [[Bangor University]]), before working as a history teacher at [[Tywyn]], [[Bootle]] and, from 1912, [[Maesteg]] Secondary School, later returning to his old College as Librarian from 1926 to 1946. As well as his prize-winning studies of the history of nonconformity in Wales, he published two autobiographical works in Welsh, edited journals for the Welsh Baptist Historical Society and the Welsh Bibliographical Society, gave lectures and radio talks, and was a member of the Board of Celtic Studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6236">The '''Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP)''' is an interagency plan by the [[United States]] government, combining efforts by both civil and military agencies, "to combat terrorism in Trans-Saharan Africa. The military component of TSCTI comprises the U.S. efforts of [[Operation Enduring Freedom - Trans Sahara]]. The goal of TSCTI is to counter terrorist influences in the region and assist governments to better control their territory and to prevent huge tracts of largely deserted African territory from becoming a safe haven for terrorist groups." The first partner nations in the program included [[Algeria]], [[Chad]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Morocco]], [[Niger]], [[Senegal]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Tunisia]].  Current membership includes eleven African countries: Algeria, [[Burkina Faso]], [[Libya]], Morocco, Tunisia, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal.  The goal of the alliance is not to fight in hot spots, but to provide preventative training and engagement with governments to help prevent the growth of terrorist organizations in the partner countries.&lt;ref name=STATEMENT-GEN-JONES-USMC&gt;{{cite web

The [[US Congress|Congress]] approved $500 million for the TSCTI over six years to support countries involved in [[counterterrorism]] against threats of [[Al Qaeda]] operating in central African countries. In February 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] also authorized the creation of a new [[United States Africa Command|Africa Command]] to be established by September 2007, under which future African continental operations would be conducted.&lt;ref name=AFRICA-TO-GET-ITS-OWN-US-MILITARY-COMMAND&gt;{{cite news

Critics of the initiative have questioned of the extent and presence of Islamic-extremist terrorism in the region and the actions and past behavior of some of the partner governments, who may be using the program to gain training, equipment and funds in order to effectively control and repress legitimate democratic movements in member states, or to fuel wars between neighboring African countries.&lt;ref name=DESERT-FAUX&gt;{{cite web

'''Élie Benoist''' (20 January 1640 – 15 November 1728), was a [[France|French]] [[Protestant]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], known as an [[historian]] of the [[Edict of Nantes]].&lt;ref&gt;Dates and biographical details in this article are drawn from Charles Johnston, "Elie Benoist, Historian of the Edict of Nantes" ''Church History'' '''55''' (1986) pp. 468–488, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benoist was born in [[Paris]] to parents who were servants of the Protestant family of [[La Trémoille]]. He displayed an early fondness for the [[classics]], and supported himself tutoring in divinity while he studied at [[Collège de Montaigu|Montaigu College]] and at the Collège de La Marche (in the [[University of Paris]]) after the Huguenot college at [[Montauban]] was disbanded on protest from the [[Jesuits]]. 

He was ordained in 1664 from [[Puylaurens]]. In 1665 he was called to [[Alençon]], where the original temple of the [[Huguenots]] had been ordered demolished the previous year. He served for twenty years as Protestant minister on the outskirts of the city, with as much prudence as capacity, under the watchful eye of the authorities. He married a difficult wife. He met with much opposition from the [[Roman Catholics]], especially from the [[Charles de la Rue|Jesuit de la Rue]], who attacked him and even incited a riot against him in August 1681.

He was already in hiding in Paris at the time of the [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revocation of the Edict of Nantes]]. Benoist immediately went to [[Holland]], and was called as minister to the Walloon church of [[Delft]], which worshiped in a chapel adjacent to the Prinsenhof; there he stayed thirty years, followed by an actively participating retirement. In 1687 he engaged on his massive project of the history of the Edict of Nantes, published from 1693 to 1695 and rapidly translated into English as it appeared. "To this undertaking Benoist brought the advantages of a solid education, a capacity for meticulous detail and painstaking research, integrity in the use of his sources, and a desire to be fair while acknowledging his ardent desire to vindicate his people," is the conclusion of his biographer Charles Johnston.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Johnston 1986, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;  He died, aged 88, in [[Delft]].

'''Étienne-Michel Faillon''' (3 January 1800 &amp;ndash; 25 October 1870) was a Catholic historian.

==Biography==
Faillon was born in [[Tarascon]], France.  He studied in [[Avignon]] and [[Aix-en-Provence]], joined the [[Sulpicians]] (1821), and was ordained priest in 1824. While director of "La Solitude", he wrote several ascetic and biographical works and collected materials for future publications.

In 1848, during an official visit to [[Montreal]], he conceived the plan of his ''Histoire de la Colonie française au Canada'' (History of the French Colony in Canada). Of the twelve intended volumes of this work, intended to embrace the entire period of French rule (1534–1759), only three were published, the narrative closing with the year 1675. Two subsequent voyages to Canada enabled him to write several important biographies, those of Sister [[Marguerite Bourgeoys]], of [[Jeanne Mance]] (with the history of the [[Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal|Hôtel-Dieu]], Ville-Marie), of [[Marie-Marguerite d'Youville]], and of [[Jeanne Le Ber]]. He died in Paris.

==Works==
His chief works relating to Old France are his life of Monsieur Olier and ''Monuments inédits sur l'apostolat de Sainte Marie-Madeleine en Provence''. He has been repeatedly criticized for his partiality towards his society, to Montreal and to the [[Jesuits]]. On the other hand, he has been credited for giving prominence to persons and events of Ville-Marie, less elaborately treated by the Jesuit "Relations" and later histories.
