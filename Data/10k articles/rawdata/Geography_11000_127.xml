The '''A671''' is a road in the [[North West England|North West]] of [[England]], that runs between [[Oldham]], [[Greater Manchester]] and [[Worston]], near [[Clitheroe]], [[Lancashire]]. Major towns on the route include [[Rochdale]] and [[Burnley]]. The road is approximately {{convert|35|mi|km}} long. Between Burnley and the [[A59 road|A59]], the A671 has [[primary road|primary]] status.

The section of road between Burnley and [[Whalley, Lancashire|Whalley]] has been identified as one of the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s ten most dangerous roads, with 48 serious or fatal collisions between 2000-2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6236636.stm | title=Britain's most dangerous roads | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=2007-06-25 | accessdate=2008-03-09 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080229074117/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6236636.stm| archivedate= 29 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route==
The southern end of the road, formerly part of the [[A627 road|A627]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/map.html#389,414,1 | title=New Popular Edition Maps | accessdate=2008-03-09 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080314030500/http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/map.html| archivedate= 14 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the main route from Oldham to Rochdale until it was bypassed by the [[A627(M) motorway]] in 1972.
Between Rochdale and [[Bacup]], the road passes through the small town of [[Whitworth, Lancashire|Whitworth]]. The {{convert|3|mi|adj=on}} section through the town is called Market Street, and has several speed cameras as well as being the scene of a number of accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lancashireeveningtelegraph.co.uk/2008/3/7/1082612.html |title=Crisis talks over 'danger' road |date=2008-03-07 |accessdate=2008-03-08 |work=[[Lancashire Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Newsquest Media Group]] }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The road passes through the centre of [[Bacup]], where it crosses the [[A681 road|A681]]. It then processes through [[Broadclough]] and [[Weir]] before going over Deerplay Moor. It later crosses the [[A646 road|A646]] before reaching [[Burnley]]. North of Burnley the A671 is a [[primary road]]. There is a junction with the [[M65 motorway]] (junction 10) before the road passes through [[Padiham]], a small town within the borough of Burnley. The A671 forms the [[High Street|main street]] through the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clitheroethefuture.co.uk/market_town_report_padiham.html |title=Padiham Case Study |publisher=Clitheroe the Future |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-03-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514193600/http://www.clitheroethefuture.co.uk/market_town_report_padiham.html |archivedate=14 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond Padiham is a stretch of the road known as the Devils Elbow, near the village of [[Read, Lancashire|Read]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.lancashire.gov.uk/corporate/news/press_releases/2004/06/22/0003.asp | title=News: Works On A671 Whalley Road, Read | publisher=Lancashire County Council | date=2004-06-22 | accessdate=2008-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further to the north-west there is the junction with the [[A680 road|A680]].

The road then bypasses Whalley, and ends at a roundabout, joining the [[A59 road|A59]] near [[Barrow, Clitheroe|Barrow]]. {{convert|2|mi}} further north-east, the road leaves the A59. This section of the A671 is non-primary and forms a loop through the town of Clitheroe, which is bypassed by the A59 to the south and east of the town. It heads to the north through Clitheroe, and heads east as it leaves the town, terminating at another junction with the A59 again near [[Worston]].

==Bypass Proposals==

There have been a large number of road traffic incidents on the A671 as it passes through the small hamlets of [[Broadclough]] and [[Weir, Lancashire|Weir]] near [[Bacup]] including fatalities. Currently police are monitoring the road&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/northwest/11308062.Police_monitoring_Bacup_Weir_accident__blackspot_/ | title=Police Monitoring Bacup Weir Accident Blackspot | work=[[The Bolton News]] | publisher=[[The Bolton News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been calls from local residents, led by County Councillor Jimmy Easton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/northwest/11172039.UPDATED__Man_fighting_for_life_after_Bacup_crash/ | title=UPDATED: Man fighting for life after Bacup crash | publisher= Bolton News}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the creation of a bypass with the suggestion of utilising elements of the old highway Bacup Old Road.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5444">'''Johann August Zeune''' (12 May 1778 &amp;ndash;14 November 1853) was a German [[teacher]] of [[geography]] and [[Germanic languages]], as well as the founder of the [[Berlin Foundation for the Blind]].

[[File:Johann August Zeune wb.jpg|thumb|Johann August Zeune]]

== Life ==
Zeune was born on 12 May 1778 in [[Wittenberg|Lutherstadt Wittenberg]] as the son of [[Johann Karl Zeune]], professor of Greek at the [[University of Wittenberg]]. In his parents' house, he was educated by his father and tutor. In 1798 Zeune started studying at the [[Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg University enrolled]]. He graduated with his thesis on the history of geography, and was awarded for a short time the dignity of an academic faculty, as a Quasi-professor of Geography. His novel „Höhenschichten-Karte” "Topological map" of the earth, had made him famous in academic circles.

In 1803, he moved to Berlin and became a teacher at the  Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster (gray convent school). In Berlin, where he lived as a scholar, he was on friendly terms with [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and the historian [[Johannes Peter Müller|Johannes von Müller]]. He applied unsuccessfully for an expedition into the interior of Africa, and shortly thereafter went into the "inner world of the [[blindness|blind]]". In the field of ophthalmology Zeune expanded his knowledge to the founder of the first European foundation for the Blind, [[Valentin Haüy]] in [[Paris]]. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] decreed on 11 August 1806 to create a foundation for the blind in Berlin . Zeune was offered that job. On 13 October the same year he was able to start classes. It was the first blind school in Germany.

With money from friends and his own fortune, he saved the school by the time of distress.  Johann August Zeune was a professor of geography in 1810 in Berlin. From 1811 to 1821 he lectured at the University of Berlin also about German language and literature. Educational skills were presented in his Manual of Education of the Blind "Belisarius" (1808) and the work "Gea. Attempt at a scientific geography" (1808).

After the French occupation, he joined as a political journalist of decidedly patriotic stance.

As Germanist Zeune stood under the spell of romantic notions, he fought against the usage of foreign words and  worked on the publication of the [[Nibelungenlied]] which he published a prose translation (1813) and a paperback edition (1815).

August Zeune died on  November 14, 1853 in Berlin, after he had lost his eyesight in old age. He was buried at the Berlin [[St. George's Cemetery]] in the [[Greifswald Street]] 229/234

In his honor,  the Johann August Zeune School for the Blind in [[Berlin-Steglitz]] and the Zeunepromenade where named after him (see [[Rothenburg (Berlin)]]).

The [[shoreline]] is where the land meets the sea and it is continually changing. Over the long term, the water is eroding the land. Beaches represent a special case, in that they exist where sand accumulated from the same processes that strip away rocky and sedimentary material. That is, they can grow as well as erode. [[River delta|River deltas]] are another exception, in that silt that erodes up river can accrete at the river's outlet and extend ocean shorelines. Catastrophic events such as [[tsunami]]s, [[hurricane]]s and [[storm surge]]s accelerate beach erosion, potentially carrying away the entire sand load. Human activities can be as catastrophic as hurricanes, albeit usually over a longer time interval.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Erosion and accretion==

=== Extraordinary processes: tsunamis and hurricane-driven storm surges ===
[[Image:Storm surge graphic.svg|thumb|400px]]
[[Tsunamis]], potentially enormous [[wave]]s often caused by [[earthquake]]s, have great [[erosion]]al and [[sediment]]-reworking potential.  They may strip beaches of [[sand]] that may have taken years to accumulate and may destroy trees and other coastal vegetation.  Tsunamis are also capable of [[flooding]] hundreds of meters inland past the typical high-water level and fast-moving water, associated with the inundating tsunami, can crush homes and other coastal structures.

A [[storm surge]] is an onshore gush of water associated with a [[low pressure]] weather system&amp;mdash;storms.  Storm surges can cause [[Accretion (coastal management)|beach accretion]] and erosion.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2005AM/finalprogram/abstract_96788.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Historically notable storm surges occurred during the [[North Sea Flood of 1953]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]].

===Gradual processes===
The gradual evolution of beaches often comes from the interaction of [[longshore drift]], a wave-driven process by which sediments move along a beach shore, and other sources of erosion or accretion, such as nearby rivers.

====Deltas====
[[River delta|Deltas]] are nourished by [[alluvial]] systems and accumulate [[sand]] and [[silt]], growing where the sediment flux from land is large enough to avoid complete removal by coastal currents, tides, or waves.

Most modern deltas formed during the last five thousand years, after the present sea-level high stand was attained. However, not all sediment remains permanently in place: in the short term (decades to centuries), exceptional river floods, storms or other energetic events may remove significant portions of delta sediment or change its lobe distribution and, on longer geological time scales, sea-level fluctuations lead to destruction of deltaic features.

====Historical accretion of European beaches====
[[Image:rhone delta img.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Main stages of Holocene evolution of the Rhone delta]]
In the [[Mediterranean sea]], deltas have been continuously growing for the last several thousand years.  Six to seven thousand years ago, the sea level stabilized, and continuous river systems, ephemeral torrents, and other factors began this steady accretion.  Since intense human use of coastal areas is a relatively recent phenomenon (except in the [[Nile]] delta), beach contours were primarily shaped by natural forces until the last centuries.

In [[Barcelona]], for example, the accretion of the coast was a natural process until the late Middle Ages, when [[harbor]]-building increased the rate of [[Accretion (coastal management)|accretion]].

The port of [[Ephesus]], one of the great cities of the [[Ancient Greece|Ionian Greeks]] in [[Asia Minor]], was filled with sediment due to accretion from a nearby river; it is now {{convert|5|km|mi|sp=us}} from the sea. Likewise, [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], the once-important port near [[ancient Rome]], is now several kilometers inland, the coastline having moved slowly seaward.

[[Bruges]] became a port during the early Middle Ages and was accessible by sea until around 1050. At that time, however, the natural link between Bruges and the sea silted up.  In 1134, a storm flood opened a deep channel, the [[Zwin]], linking the city to the sea until the fifteenth century via a canal from the Zwin to Bruges. Bruges had to use a number of outports, such as [[Damme]] and [[Sluis]], for this purpose. In 1907, a new seaport was inaugurated in [[Zeebrugge]].

==Modern beach recession==
[[Image:Porto2 eurosion.jpg|Eroding beach in Portugal.|thumb|180px]]
At the present time important segments of low coasts are in recession, losing sand and reducing beach dimensions. This loss can occur very rapidly. There are various reasons for beach recession, some more natural than others (degree of [[anthropization]]). Examples of this are occurring at [[Sète]], in California, in Poland, in [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]] (Portugal), and in the Netherlands and elsewhere along the [[North Sea]]. In Europe, coastal erosion is widespread (at least 70%) and distributed very irregularly.

===France===

====Atlantic coast====
[[File:Capbreton Blockhauss vus du Sud.jpg|thumb|300px|Old German-built WWII bunkers at [[Capbreton]], south-west of France]]
Some of the coastal defence bunkers of the [[Atlantic Wall]], built by the German soldiers during the Second World War at the top of the dunes are now underwater 2/3 of the times. It shows 200 meters of recession of the beach in 65 years.

====Sète====

The coast recession near [[Sète]] is related with coastal drift sand supply interruption due to growth of the [[Rhone]] delta, which (like most deltas) is becoming independent of the rest of the coast. The present [[wikt:Lido|lido]] shoreline is 210 meters away from the Roman lido.

[[California]]'s beaches and other shoreline features change according to the availability of beach sand, the wave and current energy impinging on the coast, and other physical processes that affect the movement of sand. A constant supply of sand is necessary for beaches to form and be maintained along this shoreline. Many human activities, including dam construction and river channelization, have reduced the supply of sand that reaches the ocean.  This, in turn, has prevented beaches from being replenished and has thus created greater vulnerability for shorelines that have always been subject to varying levels of erosion.  There are few practical solutions to improving sand supply from inland sources, so management of shoreline erosion will likely continue to focus at the land/sea interface along the California coastline.

Construction of [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]], [[jetties]], or [[groyne]] fields to protect harbor entrances, maintain beaches, or protect coastal structures have both helped and harmed the movement of sand along the shoreline. Protective [[armor (hydrology)|armoring formations]] trap sand and allow beaches to expand up-coast from the device, but can interrupt the flow of sand to beaches located down-coast.

===Poland===
During the last [[glaciation]], the Baltic Polish area was covered in ice and associated morainal sediments. Deglaciation left a substantial amount of unconsolidated sediment. Currently, these unconsolidated sediments are strongly eroded and reworked by the sea.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Aveiro===
The North Portuguese coast and its beaches were fed by large [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] rivers.  The massive building of dams in the [[Douro River]] basin has cut the sediment supply to the [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]] coast, resulting in its recession.  Hard protective works have been done all along.

===The Netherlands===
[[Image:holland 8.jpg|thumb|left|Holland coast]]
The Dutch coast consists of sandy, multi-barred beaches and can be characterised as a wave-dominated coast. Approximately 290&amp;nbsp;km of the coast consists of dunes and 60&amp;nbsp;km is protected by structures such as [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] and [[dams]]. With the melting of the ice at the end of the last [[ice age]] the coastline shifted eastward until about 5000 years ago the present position of the Dutch coastline was reached. 

As the [[sea level rise]] stagnated, the sand supply decreased and the formation of the beach ridges stopped, after which when the sea broke through the lines of [[dune]]s during storms, men started to defend the land by building primitive dikes and walls. The dunes, together with the beach and the shoreline, offer a natural, sandy defence to the sea. About 30% of the Netherlands lies below sea level. 

[[Image:holland recession.jpg|thumb|right|Holland coast recession]]

Over the last 30 years, approximately 1 million m³ sand per year has been lost from the Dutch coast to deep water. In most northern coastal sections, erosion occurs in deep water and also in the nearshore zone. In most southern sections, sedimentation occurs in the nearshore zone and erosion in deep water.

Structural erosion is due to sea level rise relative to the land and, in some spots, it is caused by harbour dams. The Dutch coast looked at as a single unit shows erosive behaviour. Approximately 12 million m³ of sand is transferred annually from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Wadden Sea]] as a result of relative rising sea level and coastal erosion.

==Relative sea level changes==
Several geological events and the climate can change (progressively or suddenly) the relative height of the Earth's surface to the [[sea-level]]. These events or processes continuously change coastlines.

===Volcanism and earthquakes===
[[Image:port pozzuolim.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Old sea level mark before these tremors.]]
[[Image:port pozzuoli6.jpg|thumb|150px|right|New quay at the [[Bay of Pozzuoli]]]]

Volcanic activity can create new islands. The {{convert|800|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter [[Surtsey]] Island, [[Iceland]], for example, was created between November 1963 and June 1967. The island has since partially eroded, but it is expected to last another 100 years.

Some earthquakes can create sudden variations of relative ground level and change the coastline dramatically. Structurally controlled coasts include the [[San Andreas fault]] zone in California and the seismic Mediterranean belt (from Gibraltar to Greece).

The Bay of Pozzuoli, in [[Pozzuoli]], Italy experienced hundreds of tremors between August 1982 and December 1984. The tremors, which reached a peak on October 4, 1983, damaged 8,000 buildings in the city center and raised the sea bottom by almost {{convert|2|m|ft|sp=us}}. This rendered the Bay of [[Pozzuoli]] too shallow for large craft and required the reconstruction of the harbour with new quays. The photo at the upper right shows the harbor before the uplift while the one on the bottom right shows the new quay.

===Gradual processes: subsidence and uplift===
[[Subsidence]] is the motion of the Earth's surface downward relative to the sea level due to internal [[geodynamic]] causes. The opposite of subsidence is [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]], which increases elevation.

[[Image:Venezia acqua alta notte 2005 modificata.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[St. Mark's Square (Venice)|St. Mark's Square]], [[Venice]], during flooding]]

[[Venice]] is probably the best-known example of a subsiding location.  It experiences periodic flooding when extreme high tides or surges arrive.  This phenomenon is caused by the compaction of young sediments in the [[Po River]] delta area, magnified by subsurface water and gas exploitation. Man-made works to solve this progressive sinking have been unsuccessful.

[[Mälaren]], the third-largest lake in Sweden, is an example of [[glaciation|deglacial]] uplift.  It was once a bay on which seagoing vessels were once able to sail far into the country's interior, but it ultimately became a lake. Its uplift was caused by deglaciation: the removal of the weight of ice-age glaciers caused rapid uplift of the depressed land.  For 2,000 years as the ice was unloaded, uplift proceeded at about {{convert|7.5|cm|in|sp=us}}/year. Once deglaciation was complete, uplift slowed to about {{convert|2.5|cm|in|sp=us}} annually, and it decreased exponentially after that. Today, annual uplift rates are {{convert|1|cm|in|sp=us}} or less, and studies suggest that rebound will continue for about another 10,000 years. The total uplift from the end of deglaciation may be up to {{convert|400|m|ft|sp=us}}.

{{refimprove|date=November 2017}}'''Crawford''' is a surname (and occasional given name) of [[England|English]], [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[Northern Irish]] origin. In some cases it is a habitational name derived from several different places called ''Crawford'' (for example [[Crawford, South Lanarkshire]], Scotland; [[Dorset]], England; and [[Somerset]], England). The placename is derived from the [[Old English]] elements ''crāwe'' ("[[crow]]") and ''ford'' ("[[Ford (crossing)|ford]]"). In some cases the surname is a variant spelling of the English surname ''Crowfoot'' (see ''[[Crofoot]]''). As a surname, Crawford is the 289th most common name in Great Britain, with 30,292 bearers. It is most common in [[South Lanarkshire]] where it is the 5th most common surname with 3,384 bearers and in [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] where it is the 8th most common surname with 3,394 bearers. Other concentrations include [[Belfast]] (25th, 3,328), [[Greater Manchester]] (58th, 3,378), [[Lancashire]] (327th, 1,852), [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] (341st, 1,796) and [[Essex]] (374th, 1,722), and [[Yorkshire]]. The countries with the highest percentages of Crawford families are [[Canada]], [[Jamaica]], [[Northern Ireland]], and [[Scotland]].

[[Image:Ta-YuanMap.jpg|thumb|320px|The '''Dayuan''' (in [[Ferghana]]) was one of the three advanced civilizations of [[Central Asia]] around 130 BCE, together with [[Parthia]] and [[Greco-Bactria]], according to the Chinese historical work ''[[Book of Han]]''.]]
'''Dayuan''' ('''Ta-yuan'''; [[Old Chinese]] reconstructed pronunciation: /dhaːts ʔwan/; [[Middle Chinese]] reconstructed pronunciation according to [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank]]: /daj ʔuan/; {{zh|c={{linktext|大宛}}|p=Dàyuān|w=Ta&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-yuan&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;|l=Great [[Ionians]]}}) was a country in [[Ferghana valley]] in [[Central Asia]], described in the [[Chinese literature|Chinese]] historical works of ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' and the ''[[Book of Han]]''. It is mentioned in the accounts of the famous Chinese [[explorer]] [[Zhang Qian]] in 130 BCE and the numerous embassies that followed him into Central Asia. The country of Dayuan is generally accepted as relating to the [[Ferghana Valley]], and its Greek city [[Alexandria Eschate]] (modern [[Khujand]], [[Tajikistan]]).

These Chinese accounts describe the Dayuan as urbanized dwellers with [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] features, living in walled cities and having "customs identical to those of the [[Greco-Bactrians]]", a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] kingdom that was ruling [[Bactria]] at that time in today's northern Afghanistan. The Dayuan are also described as manufacturers and great lovers of wine.&lt;ref name="Watson, Burton 1993 pp. 244-245"&gt;Watson, Burton(1993). ''Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian''. Translated by Burton Watson. Han Dynasty II (Revised Edition), pp. 244-245. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-08166-9}}; {{ISBN|0-231-08167-7}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dayuan were probably the descendants of the [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek colonists]] that were settled by [[Alexander the Great]] in [[Ferghana]] in 329 BCE (see [[Alexandria Eschate]]), and prospered within the Hellenistic realm of the [[Seleucids]] and [[Greco-Bactrians]], until they were isolated by the migrations of the [[Yuezhi]] around 160 BCE. It appears that the name "Yuan" was simply a transliteration of [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Yavana]]'' or [[Pali]] ''[[Yona]]'', used throughout antiquity in Asia to designate [[Greeks]] ("[[Ionians]]"), so that Dayuan would mean "Great Ionians".

[[Image:Tayuan.png|thumb|140px|Characters for '''Dayuan''', associating the character for "Great", and a character originally depicting two persons seated under one roof, but used for its sound value here.  It is pronounced "yuan" instead of the more usual "wan".]]
The interaction between the Dayuan and the Chinese is historically crucial, since it  represents one of the first major contacts between an urbanized Western civilization and the Chinese civilization, opening the way to the formation of the [[Silk Road]] that was to link the East and the West in material and cultural exchange from the 1st century BCE to the 15th century.

==Hellenistic rule (329–160 BCE)==
[[Image:UrumqiWarrior.jpg|thumb|170px|Probable Greek soldier, woollen wall hanging, [[Sampul tapestry]], 3rd-2nd century BCE, Sampul, [[Urumqi]] [[Xinjiang]] Museum.]]
The region of Ferghana was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] in 329 BCE and became his most advanced base in Central Asia. He founded the fortified city of [[Alexandria Eschate]] (Lit. "Alexandria the Furthest") in the southwestern part of the [[Ferghana]] valley, on the southern bank of the river [[Syr Darya]] (ancient Jaxartes), at the location of the modern city of [[Khujand]] (also called Khozdent, formerly Leninabad), in the state of [[Tajikistan]]. Alexander built a 6 kilometer long brick wall around the city and, as similarly in the cases of the other cities he founded, had a garrison of his retired veterans and wounded settle there.

The whole of [[Bactria]], [[Transoxiana]] and the area of Ferghana remained under the control of the Hellenistic [[Seleucid Empire]] until 250 BCE.  The region then wrested independence under the leadership of its Greek governors [[Diodotus of Bactria]], to become the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].

===Greco-Bactrian kingdom (250–160 BCE)===
[[Image:EuthydemusI.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Euthydemus I]] (230–200 BC)]]
The [[Greco-Bactrian]]s held their territory, and according to the Greek historian [[Strabo]] even went beyond Alexandria Eschate and ''"extended their empire as far as the [[Seres]] and the [[Phryni]]"'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+11.11.1 Strabo XI.XI.I]). There are indications that they may have led expeditions as far as [[Kashgar]] in [[Xinjiang]], leading to the first known contacts between China and the West around 200 BC. Various statuettes and representations of Greek soldiers have been found north of the [[Tien Shan]], and are today on display in the museum of [[Urumqi]] (Boardman).

Around 160 BC, the area of Ferghana seems to have been invaded by [[Saka]] tribes (called the Sai-Wang by the Chinese). The Sai-Wang, originally settled in the [[Ili River|Ili]] valley in the general area of Lake [[Issyk Kul]], were retreating southward after having been dislodged by [[Yueh-Chi|Yuezhi]] (who themselves were fleeing from the [[Xiongnu]]):

[[Image:Tetradrachm Eukratides.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Silver tetradrachm of King [[Eucratides|Eucratides I]], who probably lost the territory of Ferghana to the Sakas.]]

{{quote|The Yuezhi attacked the king of the Sai ("Sai-Wang") who moved a considerable distance to the south and the Yuezhi then occupied his lands|Han Shu, 61 4B.}}

The Sakas occupied the Greek territory of Dayuan, benefiting from the fact that the Greco-Bactrians were fully occupied with conflicts in India against the [[Indo-Greeks]], and could hardly defend their northern provinces. According to W. W. Tarn, 

{{quote|The remaining of the Sai-Wang tribes apparently seized the Greek province of Ferghana… It was easy at this time to occupy Ferghana: [[Eucratides]] had just overthrown the [[Euthydemus I|Euthydemid]] dynasty, he himself was with his army in India, and in 159 he met his death… [[Heliocles]], preoccupied first with the recovery of Bactria and then with the invasion of India, must have let this outlying province go|W. W. Tarn, ''The Greeks in Bactria and India''.}}

==Saka rule (160 BCE onward)==
[[Image:PazyrikHorseman.JPG|thumb|170px|A [[Saka]] (Scythian) horseman from the area north of the [[Tian Shan]], [[Ukok Plateau|Pazyryk]], ''c.''300 BCE.]]
When the Chinese envoy [[Zhang Qian]] described Dayuan around 128 BCE, he mentioned, besides the flourishing urban civilization, warriors "shooting arrows on horseback",&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Burton(1993). ''Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian''. Translated by Burton Watson. Han Dynasty II (Revised Edition), p. 233. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-08166-9}}; {{ISBN|0-231-08167-7}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt; a probable description of [[Saka]] [[nomad]] warriors. Dayuan had probably by then become a kingdom of nomadic people exacting tribute from the local urbanized Hellenistic population.

Also in 106&amp;ndash;101 BCE, during their conflict with China, the country of Dayuan is said to have been an ally with the neighbouring tribes of [[Kangju]] (probably Sodgia). The Chinese also record the name of the king of Dayuan as "Mu-Kua", a Saka name rendered in Greek as Mauakes or Maues. (Another Scythian ruler by the name of [[Maues]] was later a ruler of the [[Indo-Scythian]] kingdom in northern India, during the 1st century BCE).

==Yuezhi migration==
According to the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] Chronicles In 132BCE the [[Yuezhi]] were driven out of the [[Ili River]] valley by the [[Wusun]]. They fled south from the Ili river area, by-passed the urban civilization of the Dayuan in [[Ferghana]], and re-settled north of the [[Oxus]] in [[Bactria]], definitively cutting Dayuan from contact with the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. The Yuezhi would further expand southward into Bactria proper around 125 BCE, and then going on to form the [[Kushan Empire]] in the 1st century CE.

==Interaction with China (130 BCE onward)==
The Dayuan remained a healthy and powerful civilization which had numerous contacts and exchanges with China from 130 BCE.

===Zhang Qian's Report===
[[Image:ZhangQianTravels.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Zhang Qian]] leaving emperor [[Han Wudi]], for his expedition to Central Asia from 138 to 126 BCE, [[Mogao Caves]] mural, 618–712 CE.]]
Around 130 BCE, at the time of [[Zhang Qian]]'s embassy to Central Asia, the Dayuan were described as inhabitants of a region corresponding to the [[Ferghana]], far to the west of the Chinese empire. 

{{quote|The capital of the kingdom of Dayuan is the city of Guishan ([[Khujand]]), distant from [[Chang'an]] 12,550 [[Li (Chinese unit)|li]] (Shiji,123 calls the capital Ershi). The kingdom contains 60,000 families, comprising a population of 300,000, with 60,000 trained troops, a Viceroy, and a National Assistant Prince. The seat of the Governor General lies to the east at a distance of 4,031 li.|Han Shu}}

To their south-west were the territories of the Yuezhi, with the [[Greco-Bactrians]] further south still, beyond the [[Oxus]].

{{quote|The great Yueh-chih is situated about 2000 or 3000 li west of Dayuan; they dwell north of the river Kuei (Oxus). To the south of them there is [[Daxia]] ([[Bactrians]]), to the west, Anxis ([[Parthia]]ns); to the north [[Kangju]] ([[Sogdians]]).|[[Shiji]], 123.5b}}

The Shiji then explains that the Yuezhi originally inhabited the [[Hexi Corridor]], before they were defeated by the Xiongnu under [[Mao-tun]] and later his son in 176 BCE, forcing them to go beyond the territory of the Dayuan and resettle in the West by the banks of the Oxus, between the territory of the Dayuan and Bactria to the south.

'''Urbanized city-dwellers'''
The customs of the Dayuan are said by [[Zhang Qian]] to be identical to those of the Bactrians in the south, who actually formed the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] at that time.
[[Image:HelioclesCoin.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Silver coin of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Heliocles I]] (150-125 BCE) at the time of [[Zhang Qian]]'s embassy.]]

{{quote|Their customs (the Bactrians) are the same as those of Dayuan. The people have fixed abodes and live in walled cities and regular houses like the people of Dayuan. They have no great kings or heads, but everywhere in their walled cities and settlements they have installed small kings.|[[Shiji]], 123.3b}}

They are described as town-dwellers, as opposed to other populations such as the [[Yuezhi]], the [[Wusun]] or the [[Xiongnu]] who were nomads.

{{quote|They have walled cities and houses; the large and small cities belonging to them, fully seventy in number, contain an aggregate population of several hundreds of thousands…There are more than seventy other cities in the country.|Han Shu}}

'''Appearance and Culture'''
The Shiji comments on the Caucasian-like appearance and the culture of the people around Dayuan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the states from Dayuan west to Anxi speak rather different languages, their customs are generally similar and their languages mutually intelligible. The men all have deep-set eyes and profuse beards  and whiskers. They are skillful at commerce and will haggle over a fraction of a cent. Women are held in great respect, and the men make decisions on the advice of their women.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Burton(1993). Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian. Translated by Burton Watson. Han Dynasty II (Revised Edition), pp. 245. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-08166-9}}; {{ISBN|0-231-08167-7}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They were great manufacturers and lovers of [[History of wine|wine]]:

{{quote|Round about Dayuan they make wine from grapes. Wealthy people store up as much as 10,000 stones and over in their cellars, and keep it for several tens of years without spoiling. The people are fond of wine.|[[Shiji]], 123}}

According to the Shiji, grapes and [[alfalfa]] were introduced to China from Dayuan following Zhang Qian's embassy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The regions around Dayuan make wine out of grapes, the wealthier inhabitants keeping as much as 10,000 or more [[picul]]s stored away. It can be kept for as long as twenty or thirty years without spoiling. The people love their wine and the horses love their alfalfa. The Han envoys brought back grape and alfalfa seeds to China and the emperor for the first time tried growing these plants in areas of rich soil. Later, when the Han acquired large numbers of the "heavenly horses" and the envoys from foreign states began to arrive with their retinues, the lands on all sides of the emperor's summer palaces and pleasure towers were planted with grapes and alfalfa for as far as the eye could see.&lt;ref name="Watson, Burton 1993 pp. 244-245" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Shiji also claims that [[metal casting]] was introduced to the Dayuan region by Han [[deserter]]s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the casting of coins and vessels was formerly unknown. Later, however, when some of the Chinese soldiers attached to the Han embassies ran away and surrendered to the people of the area, they taught them how to cast metal and manufacture weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Burton(1993). ''Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian''. Translated by Burton Watson. Han Dynasty II (Revised Edition), p. 245. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-08166-9}}; {{ISBN|0-231-08167-7}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Relations with China===
{{See also|War of the Heavenly Horses}}
Following the reports of Zhang Qian (who was originally sent to obtain an alliance with the [[Yuezhi]] against the [[Xiongnu]], in vain), the Chinese emperor [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Wudi]] became interested in developing commercial relationships with the sophisticated urban civilizations of Ferghana, Bactria and Parthia:
"The Son of Heaven on hearing all this reasoned thus: Ferghana (Dayuan) and the possessions of Bactria and Parthia are large countries, full of rare things, with a population living in fixed abodes and given to occupations somewhat identical with those of the Chinese people, but with weak armies, and placing great value on the rich produce of China" ([[Shiji]], 123)

The Chinese subsequently sent numerous embassies, around ten every year, to these countries and as far as [[Seleucid]] Syria.
"Thus more embassies were dispatched to An-si ([[Parthia]]), An-ts'ai (the Aorsi, or [[Alans]]), Li-kan (Syria under the Seleucids), T'iau-chi ([[Chaldea]]), and Shon-tu ([[India]])... As a rule, rather more than ten such missions went forward in the course of a year, and at the least five or six." ([[Shiji]], 123)

[[Image:HanHorse.jpg|thumb|250px|Fragment of a terracotta horse sculpture of the [[Han dynasty#Eastern Han|Later Han Dynasty]] (1st-2nd century AD/CE)]]
The Chinese were also strongly attracted by the tall and powerful horses ("heavenly horses") in the possession of the Dayuan, which were of capital importance to fight the nomad Xiongnu. The refusal of the Dayuan to offer them enough horses along with a series of conflicts and mutual disrespect resulted in the death of the Chinese ambassador and the confiscation of the gold sent as payment for the horses.

Enraged, and thinking Dayuan weak, the Chinese Emperor in 104 BCE sent out [[Li Guangli]], the brother of his favorite concubine. He was given 6,000 horsemen and '30,000 young men of bad reputation rounded up from the provinces'. General Li lost many men along the way in petty fights with local rulers. After a severe defeat at a place called Yucheng Li concluded that he was not strong enough to take the enemy capital and therefore returned to [[Dunhuang]] (about 102 BC).

Emperor Wudi responded by giving Li Guangli a much larger army along with a huge number of oxen, donkeys and camels to carry supplies. With this force he had no difficulty reaching Ershi, the Dayuan capital. After a 40-day siege the Chinese had broken through the outer wall and cut off the water supply. The nobles of Ershi killed their king and sent his head to Li Guangli, offering the Chinese all the horses they wanted. Li accepted the offer, appointed one of the nobles to be the new king and withdrew with the horses. On his return journey all the petty states accepted Chinese sovereignty. He reached the [[Jade Gate]] about 100 BC with 10,000 men and 1,000 horses.

Contacts with the West were re-established following the peace treaty with the Yuan. Ambassadors were once again sent to the West, caravans were sent to Bactria.

==An era of East-West trade and cultural exchange==
The [[Silk Road]] essentially came into being from the 1st century BCE, following the efforts of China to consolidate a road to the Western world, both through direct settlements in the area of the Tarim Basin and diplomatic relations with the countries of the Dayuan, Parthians and Bactrians further west.

Intense trade followed soon, confirmed by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] craze for Chinese [[silk]] (supplied by the Parthians) from the 1st century BC, to the point that the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] issued, in vain, several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk, on economic and moral grounds. This is attested by at least three significant authors:
* [[Strabo]] (64/ 63 BCE&amp;ndash;c. 24 CE).
* [[Seneca the Younger]] (c. 3 BCE&amp;ndash;65 CE).
* [[Pliny the Elder]] (23&amp;ndash;79 CE).

This is also the time when the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] faith and the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] culture started to travel along the Silk Road, penetrating China from around the 1st century BCE.

'''''Diyār Mudar''''' ("abode of Mudar") is the medieval [[Arabic]] name of the westernmost of the three provinces of al-Jazira ([[Upper Mesopotamia]]), the other two being [[Diyar Bakr]] and [[Diyar Rabi'a]]. According to [[al-Baladhuri]], all three provinces were named after the main Arab tribes that were settled there by [[Mu'awiya I]] in the course of the [[early Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century. The Diyar Mudar was settled by the [[Mudar]] tribe.

Diyar Mudar encompasses the region on both banks of the middle course of the river [[Euphrates]], from the area of [[Samosata]] to the town of [[Anah]], and includes the area of the [[Balikh River]] and the lower reaches of the river [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]]. Its main cities were [[Raqqa]] in the south and [[Edessa]] (al-Ruha in Arabic) in the north, and other major cities included [[Harran]], and Saruj (now [[Suruç]]).

Geographically and politically, in early Islamic times the Diyar Mudar was usually part of al-Jazira. In the mid-10th century, the region came under [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid]] control, and under [[Sayf al-Dawla]] it was detached from the Jazira and the Hamdanids of [[Mosul]] and subordinated to the northern Syria-based [[Emirate of Aleppo]]. In the same period, the region came under attack by the resurgent [[Byzantine Empire]].

After the loss of control of the Hamdanids, the Diyar Mudar and its cities came under the sway of the [[Numayrid dynasty|Banu Numayr]], with [[Waththab ibn Ja'bar al-Numayri]] becoming autonomous governor of Harran by 1002, while Edessa was conquered by the [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[George Maniakes]] in 1032. Thereafter the region became divided into a mostly Christian-ruled northern portion, subject to [[Armenians|Armenian]] colonization, while the area from Harran to the Euphrates was dominated by Arab nomadic tribes.

[[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] raids began in the 1060s and 1070s, but it was not until 1086 that the Seljuq [[sultan]] [[Malik-Shah I]] unified the province under his control. The advent of the [[Crusades]] re-established the division between a Christian north (the [[County of Edessa]]) and a Muslim south, which lasted until the mid-12th century. The [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]]s gained control of the region under [[Saladin]], and kept it until the [[Mongol invasions of the Levant|Mongol invasion of the Levant]] in 1260.

The '''GPS-aided GEO augmented navigation''' ('''GAGAN''') is an implementation of a regional [[satellite-based augmentation system]] (SBAS) by the [[Government of India|Indian government]]. It is a system to improve the accuracy of a [[Global navigation satellite system|GNSS receiver]] by providing reference signals.&lt;ref name="ASM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asmmag.com/news/india-approves-gagan-system |title=India Approves Gagan System |date=15 September 2008 |work=Magazine article |publisher=Asian Surveying and Mapping |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519215721/http://www.asmmag.com/news/india-approves-gagan-system |archivedate=19 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Airports Authority of India|AAI]]'s efforts towards implementation of operational SBAS can be viewed as the first step towards introduction of modern [[Communication, navigation and surveillance]]/[[Air Traffic Management]] system over Indian airspace.&lt;ref name="mycoordinates.org"&gt;[http://www.mycoordinates.org/gagan-update-arjunsingh-mar-06.php GAGAN Update Dr. Arjin Singh, Additional GM, Directorate of Global Navigation System, Airport Authority of India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828035632/http://www.mycoordinates.org/gagan-update-arjunsingh-mar-06.php |date=28 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has established 15 Indian reference stations, 3 Indian navigation land uplink stations, 3 Indian mission control centers, and installation of all associated software and communication links.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gagan-system-ready-for-operations/article5565700.ece&lt;/ref&gt; It will be able to help pilots to navigate in the Indian airspace by an accuracy of 3 m. This will be helpful for landing aircraft in marginal weather and difficult approaches like [[Mangalore Airport (India)|Mangalore]] and [[Kushok Bakula Rimpochhe Airport|Leh]] airports.

==Implementation==
The {{INRConvert|7.74|b|0}} project was created in three phases through 2008 by the [[Airports Authority of India|Airport Authority of India]] with the help of the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]]'s (ISRO) technology and space support.&lt;ref name=Isro&gt;{{cite news|title=Satellite Navigation – GAGAN|url=http://www.isro.org/scripts/futureprogramme.aspx#Satellite|accessdate=13 June 2012|newspaper=ISRO website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to provide navigation system for all phases of flight over the Indian airspace and in the adjoining area. It is applicable to safety-to-life operations, and meets the performance requirements of international civil aviation regulatory bodies.

The space component  became  available after the launch of the GAGAN payload on the GSAT-8 communication satellite, which was successfully launched. This payload was also part of the GSAT-4 satellite that was lost when the geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) failed during launch in April 2010. A final system acceptance test was conducted during June 2012 followed by system certification during July 2013.&lt;ref name=Isro/&gt;

== Technology ==

To begin implementing a satellite-based augmentation system over the Indian airspace, [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] ([[Wide Area Augmentation System|WAAS]]) codes for L1 frequency and L5 frequency were obtained from the [[United States Air Force]] and [[United States|U.S]] [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] on November 2001 and March 2005.&lt;ref name="mycoordinates.org" /&gt; The system will use eight reference stations located in [[Delhi]], [[Guwahati]], [[Kolkata]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Bangalore]], [[Jammu]] and [[Port Blair]], and a master control center at [[Bangalore]]. US defense contractor [[Raytheon]] has stated they will bid to build the system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-defence.com/reports-3966 Raytheon to bid for geosynchronous augmented navigation system (GAGAN) Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology demonstration ==

A national plan for satellite navigation including implementation of technology demonstration system (TDS) over the Indian air space as a proof of concept had been prepared jointly by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and ISRO. TDS was successfully completed during 2007 by installing eight Indian Reference Stations (INRESs) at eight Indian airports and linked to the Master Control Center (MCC) located near Bangalore. Preliminary system acceptance testing has been successfully completed in December 2010.&lt;ref name=Isro/&gt; The [[ground segment]] for GAGAN, which has been put up by the Raytheon, has 15 reference stations scattered across the country. Two mission control centres, along with associated uplink stations, have been set up at Kundalahalli in Bangalore. One more control centre and uplink station are to come up at Delhi. As a part of the programme, a network of 18 total electron content (TEC) monitoring stations were installed at various locations in India to study and analyse the behaviour of the ionosphere over the Indian region.

GAGAN's TDS signal in space provides a three-metre accuracy as against the requirement of 7.6 metres. Flight inspection of GAGAN signal is being carried out at [[Kozhikode]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Nagpur]] and [[Bangalore]] airports and the results have been satisfactory so far.

=== Study of Ionosphere ===
One essential component of the GAGAN project is the study of the ionospheric behaviour over the Indian region. This has been specially taken up in view of the uncertain nature of the behaviour of the ionosphere in the region. The study will lead to the optimisation of the algorithms for the ionospheric corrections in the region.

To study the ionospheric behaviour more effectively over entire Indian airspace, Indian universities and R&amp;D labs, which are involved in the development of regional based ionotropic model for GAGAN, have suggested nine more TEC stations.&lt;ref name="mycoordinates.org"/&gt;

== Technology Integration ==

GAGAN after its final operational phase completion, will be compatible with other SBAS systems such as the [[wide-area augmentation system]] (WAAS), the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS) and the [[Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System]] (MSAS) and will provide seamless air navigation service across regional boundaries. While the ground segment consists of eight reference stations and a master control center, which will have sub systems such as data communication network, [[SBAS]] correction and verification system, operations and maintenance system, performance monitoring display and payload simulator, Indian land uplinking stations will have dish antenna assembly. The space segment will consist of one geo-navigation transponder.

== Effective flight-management system ==

A flight-management system based on GAGAN will then be poised to save operators time and money by managing climb, descent and engine performance profiles. The FMS will improve the efficiency and flexibility by increasing the use of operator-preferred trajectories.
It will improve airport and airspace access in all weather conditions, and the ability to meet the environmental and obstacle clearance constraints. It will also enhance reliability and reduce delays by defining more precise terminal area procedures that feature parallel routes and environmentally optimised airspace corridors.

* GAGAN will increase safety by using a three-dimensional approach operation with course guidance to the runway, which will reduce the risk of controlled flight into terrain i.e., an accident whereby an airworthy aircraft, under pilot control, inadvertently flies into terrain, an obstacle, or water.
* GAGAN will also offer high position accuracies over a wide geographical area like the Indian airspace. These positions accuracies will be simultaneously available to 80 civilian and more than 200 non-civilian airports and airfields and will facilitate an increase in the number of airports to 500 as planned. These position accuracies can be further enhanced with ground-based, augmentation system.

== Developments ==

The first GAGAN transmitter was integrated into the [[GSAT-4]] [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] satellite, and had a goal of being operational in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-defence.com/reports/2239 ISRO, Raytheon complete tests for GAGAN satellite navigational system.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205075702/http://www.india-defence.com/reports/2239 |date=5 December 2006 }} India Defense Website. 20 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.N. Suryanarayana Rao and S. Pal.

Abstract from the India-United States Conference on Space Science, Applications, and Commerce. June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a series of delays, GSAT-4 was launched on 15 April 2010, however it failed to reach orbit after the third stage of the [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle]] Mk.II that was carrying it malfunctioned.&lt;ref name="GSAT-4 failure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/article398070.ece|title=India's indigenous GSLV D3 rocket fails in mission|last=Subramanian|first=T. S.|date=15 April 2010|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Raytheon had won an 82 million dollar contract. It was mainly dedicated to modernise Indian air navigation system.&lt;ref name="GovCon"/&gt; The vice president of Command &amp; Control Systems, Raytheon Network Centric Systems, Andy Zogg commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;GAGAN will be the world's most advanced air navigation system and further reinforces India's leadership in the forefront of air navigation. GAGAN will greatly improve safety, reduce congestion and enhance communications to meet India's growing air traffic management needs&lt;ref name="GovCon"&gt;{{cite news|title=Raytheon Wins $82M Air Navigation Contract From India|url=http://www.govconwire.com/2009/07/raytheon-wins-82m-air-navigation-contract-from-india/|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=GovCon Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2012, the [[DRDO|Defence Research and Development Organisation]] received a "miniaturised version" of the device with all the features from [[global positioning systems]] (GPS) and [[global navigation satellite systems]] (GNSS). The module weighing just 17 gm, can be used in multiple platforms ranging from aircraft (e.g. winged or rotor-craft) to small boats, ships. Reportedly, it can also assist "survey applications". It is a cost-efficient device and can be of "tremendous" civilian use. The navigation output is composed of GPS, GLONASS and GPS+GLONASS position, speed and time data. According to a statement released by the DRDO, G3oM is a state-of-the-art technology receiver, integrating Indian GAGAN as well as both global positioning system and GLONASS systems.&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;

According to Deccan chronicle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[G. Satheesh Reddy]], associate director of the city-based Research Centre Imarat, said the product is bringing about a quantum leap in the area of GNSS technology and has paved the way for highly miniaturised GNSS systems for the future.&lt;ref name=DC&gt;[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/17-gm-device-guide-missiles-968 17-gm device to guide missiles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905014057/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/17-gm-device-guide-missiles-968 |date=5 September 2012 }} Deccan Chronicle.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 30 December 2012, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), India provisionally certified the GPS-aided geo-augmented navigation (GAGAN) system to RNP0.1 (Required Navigation Performance, 0.1 Nautical Mile) service level. The certification enabled aircraft fitted with SBAS equipment to use GAGAN signal in space for navigation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isro.org/pressrelease/scripts/pressreleasein.aspx?Jan03_2014 | title=GAGAN System Certified for RNP0.1 Operations | date=3 January 2014 | accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellites===

'''GSAT-8''' is an Indian geostationary satellites, which was successfully launched using [[Ariane 5]] on 21 May 2011 and is positioned in geosynchronous orbit at 55 degrees E longitude.

'''GSAT-10''' is envisaged to augment the growing need of Ku and C-band transponders and carries 12 Ku Band, 12 C Band and 12 Extended C Band transponders and a GAGAN payload. The spacecraft employs the standard I-3K structure with power handling capability of around 6&amp;nbsp;kW with a lift off mass of 3400&amp;nbsp;kg. GSAT-10 was successfully launched by [[Ariane 5]] on 29 September 2012.&lt;ref name=Isro/&gt;

'''GSAT-15''' carries 24 Ku band transponders with India coverage beam and a GAGAN payload. was successfully launched on 10 November 2015, 21:34:07 UTC, completing the constellation.

===Indian regional navigation satellite system===
{{main|Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System}}
The Indian government has stated that it intends to use the experience of creating the GAGAN system to enable the creation of an autonomous regional navigation system called the '''I'''ndian '''R'''egional '''N'''avigation '''S'''atellite '''S'''ystem [[IRNSS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isro.org/newsletters/spaceindia/aprsep2006/Satnavindustry.htm SATNAV Industry Meet 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331145825/http://www.isro.org/newsletters/spaceindia/aprsep2006/Satnavindustry.htm |date=31 March 2007 }}. ISRO Space India Newsletter. April – September 2006 Issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

IRNSS-1
Indian regional navigational satellite system (IRNSS)-1, the first of the seven satellites of the [[IRNSS]] constellation, carries a navigation payload and a C-band ranging transponder. The spacecraft employs an optimised I-1K structure with a power handling capability of around 1660W and a lift off mass of 1425&amp;nbsp;kg, and is designed for a nominal mission life of 10 years. The first satellite of IRNSS constellation was launched onboard PSLV (C22) on 1 July 2012. While the full constellation was planned to be realised during 2014 time frame, launch of subsequent satellites got delayed.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Currently all 7 satellites are in orbit but in 2017 it was announced that all three&amp;nbsp;[[rubidium]]&amp;nbsp;[[atomic clock]]s&amp;nbsp;on board&amp;nbsp;[[IRNSS-1A]]&amp;nbsp;had failed, mirroring similar failures in the&amp;nbsp;[[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] constellation. The first failure occurred in July 2016, following which two other clocks also failed. This rendered the satellite somewhat redundant and required replacement. Although the satellite still performs other functions, the data is coarse, and thus cannot be used for accurate measurements.&amp;nbsp;ISRO plans to replace it with IRNSS-1H in July or August 2017.

Two more clocks in the navigational system had started showing signs of abnormality, thereby taking the total number of failed clocks to five.

As a precaution to extend the operational life of navigation satellite, ISRO is running only one rubidium atomic clock instead of two in the remaining six satellites.&amp;nbsp;Each satellite has three clocks, therefore a total of 27 clocks for all satellites in the system (including standby satellites). The clocks of both IRNSS and GALILEO were supplied by SpectraTime. ISRO replaced the atomic clocks in two standby NavIC satellites.&amp;nbsp;The setback comes at a time when IRNSS is yet to start commercial operations.

== Applications ==

Karnataka Forest Department has used GAGAN to build a new, accurate and publicly available satellite based database of its forestlands. This is a followup to the Supreme Court directive to states to update and put up their respective forest maps. The geospatial database of forestlands pilot has used data from the Cartosat-2 satellite. The maps are meant to rid authorities of ambiguities related to forest boundaries and give clarity to forest administrators, revenue officials as also the public, according to R.K. Srivastava, chief conservator of forests (headquarters).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gagan-kicks-off-new-forest-database/article7118060.ece?w=city GAGAN kicks off new forest database]. The Hindu. Retrieved on 2015-04-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various Indian manufactured missiles including the [[BrahMos]] will use GAGAN for guidance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/Desi-G3OM-Makes-BrahMos-Smarter/2014/07/09/article2320976.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sometimes, the term is used for a particular computational method for transverse Mercator: that is, how to convert between latitude/longitude and projected coordinates.  There is no simple closed formula to do so when the earth is modelled as an ellipsoid.  But the ''Gauss–Krüger'' method gives the same results as other methods, at least if you are sufficiently near the central meridian: less than 100 degrees of longitude, say.  Further away, some methods become inaccurate.
* The term is also used for a particular set of transverse Mercator projections used in narrow zones in Europe and South America, at least in Germany, Turkey, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Finland and Argentina.  This ''Gauss–Krüger'' system is similar to the [[universal transverse Mercator]] system, but the central meridians of the Gauss–Krüger zones are only 3° apart, as opposed to 6° in UTM.

'''[[Panama]]''' is a country located in [[Central America]], bordering both the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]], between [[Colombia]] and [[Costa Rica]]. Panama is located on the narrow and low [[Isthmus of Panama]].

This S-shaped isthmus is situated between 7° and 10° north [[latitude]] and 77° and 83° west [[longitude]]. Panama encompasses approximately 77,082 square kilometers (29,762&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi), is 772 kilometers (480&amp;nbsp;mi) in length, and is between 60 and 177 kilometers (37 and 110&amp;nbsp;mi) in width.

==Elevation==
[[File:Panama Topography.png|thumb|550px|Panama's topography.]]

The dominant feature of Panama's landform is the central spine of mountains and hills that forms the continental divide. The divide does not form part of the great mountain chains of North America, and only near the Colombian border are there highlands related to the [[Andes|Andean]] system of South America. The spine that forms the divide is the highly eroded arch of an uplift from the sea bottom, in which peaks were formed by volcanic intrusions.

The mountain range of the divide is called the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] near the Costa Rican border. Farther east it becomes the Serranía de Tabasará, and the portion of it closer to the lower saddle of the isthmus, where the canal is located, is often called the Sierra de Veraguas. As a whole, the range between Costa Rica and the canal is generally referred to by Panamanian geographers as the [[Cordillera Central, Costa Rica|Cordillera Central]].

The highest point in Panama is the [[Volcán Barú]] (formerly known as the Volcán de Chiriquí), which rises to {{convert|3475|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. The apex of a highland that includes Panama's richest soil, the Volcán Barú is still referred to as a volcano, although it has been inactive for millennia. It offers a view of both the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seeit360.com/360-virtual-tours/volcan-baru-summit|title=Volcan Baru Summit Virtual Tour|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
{{See also|Panama_City#Climate}}
[[File:Panama map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Panama map of Köppen climate classification.]]

Panama has a tropical climate. Temperatures are uniformly high—as is the relative humidity—and there is little seasonal variation. Diurnal ranges are low; on a typical dry-season day in the capital city, the early morning minimum may be {{convert|24|°C|1}} and the afternoon maximum {{convert|29|°C|1}}. The temperature seldom exceeds {{convert|32|°C|1}} for more than a short time.

Temperatures on the Pacific side of the isthmus are somewhat lower than on the Caribbean, and breezes tend to rise after dusk in most parts of the country. Temperatures are markedly cooler in the higher parts of the mountain ranges, and frosts occur in the Cordillera de Talamanca in western Panama.

Climatic regions are determined less on the basis of temperature than on rainfall, which varies regionally from less than {{convert|1300|mm|in|1|sp=us}} to more than {{convert|3000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year. Almost all of the rain falls during the rainy season, which is usually from May through November, but varies in length from seven to nine months, with certain exception due to [[Monsoon]]s. The cycle of rainfall is determined primarily by two factors: moisture from the Caribbean, which is transported by north and northeast winds prevailing during most of the year, and the continental divide, which acts as a rain shield for the Pacific lowlands.

A third influence that is present during the late autumn is the southwest wind off the Pacific. This wind brings some precipitation to the Pacific lowlands, modified by the highlands of the [[Península de Azuero]], which form a partial rainshield for much of central Panama.  Rainfall is generally much heavier on the Caribbean than on the Pacific side. The annual average in Panama City is little more than half of that in Colón. Although rainy-season thunderstorms are common, the country is outside the [[hurricane belt]].

==Vegetation==
[[File:Panama veg 1981.jpg|thumb|550px|Panama's vegetation, 1981.]]
Panama's tropical environment supports an abundance of plants. Forests dominate, interrupted in places by grasslands, scrub, and crops. Nearly 40 percent of Panama is wooded. Deforestation is a continuing threat to the rain-drenched woodlands. Tree cover has been reduced by more than 50 percent since the 1940s.

Subsistence farming, widely practiced from the northeastern jungles to the southwestern grasslands, consists largely of corn, bean, and tuber plots. [[Mangrove]] swamps occur along parts of both coasts, with [[banana]] plantations occupying deltas near Costa Rica. In many places, a multi-canopied rain forest abuts the swamp on one side of Panama and largens to the lower reaches of slopes in the other.

==Harbors==
{{See also|List of islands of Panama}}

The Caribbean coastline is marked by several good natural harbors. The numerous islands of the Archipiélago de Bocas del Toro, near the Beaches of Costa Rica, provide an extensive natural roadstead and shield the banana port of [[Almirante, Bocas del Toro|Almirante]]. The over 350 [[San Blas Islands]], near Colombia, are strung out for more than {{convert|abbr=on|160|km|0}} along the sheltered Caribbean coastline.

The major port on the Pacific coastline is [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]]. The principal islands are those of the [[Archipiélago de las Perlas]] in the middle of the [[Gulf of Panama]], the penal colony on the [[Isla de Coiba]] in the Golfo de Chiriquí, and the decorative island of [[Taboga Island|Taboga]], a tourist attraction that can be seen from Panama City. In all, there are some 1,000 islands off the Pacific coast.

The Pacific coastal waters are extraordinarily shallow. Depths of {{convert|180|m|0}} are reached only outside the perimeters of both the Gulf of Panama and the Golfo de Chiriquí, and wide mud flats extend up to {{convert|abbr=on|70|km|0}} seaward from the coastlines. As a consequence, the tidal range is extreme. A variation of about {{convert|70|cm|ft|1}} between high and low water on the Caribbean coast contrasts sharply with over {{convert|abbr=on|700|cm|ft|0}} on the Pacific coast, and some {{convert|abbr=on|130|km|0}} up the Río Tuira, the tidal range is still over {{convert|abbr=on|500|cm|ft|0}}.

==Waterways==
Nearly 500 rivers lace Panama's rugged landscape. Mostly unnavigable, many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. The Río Chepo and the [[Río Chagres]] are sources of hydroelectric power. The Kampia lake and Madden Lake (also filled with water from the Río Chagres) provide hydroelectricity for the area of the former Canal Zone.

More than 300 rivers empty into the Pacific. These Pacific-oriented rivers are longer and slower running than those of the Caribbean side. Their basins are also more extensive. One of the longest is the [[Río Tuira]] which flows into the [[Golfo de San Miguel]] and is the nation's only river navigable by larger vessels.

==Administrative divisions==

[[Image:Countries-Panama-provinces-2005-10-18-en.png|thumb|550px|A map of Panama showing its ten provinces and five provincial-level ''comarcas indígenas'' (indigenous regions).]]
Panama is divided into 10 provinces, plus several indigenous ''[[comarca]]s''. The provinces are divided into districts, which in turn are subdivided into sections called corregimientos. Configurations of the corregimientos are changed periodically to accommodate population changes as revealed in the census reports.

A '''greenhouse''' (also called a '''glasshouse''', or, if with sufficient heating, a '''hothouse''') is a structure with walls and roof made chiefly of transparent material, such as glass, in which [[plant]]s requiring regulated climatic conditions are grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures range in size from small sheds to industrial-sized buildings. A miniature greenhouse is known as a [[cold frame]]. The interior of a greenhouse exposed to sunlight becomes significantly warmer than the external ambient temperature, protecting its contents in cold weather.

Many commercial glass greenhouses or hothouses are [[high tech]] production facilities for vegetables or flowers. The glass greenhouses are filled with equipment including screening installations, heating, cooling, lighting, and may be controlled by a computer to optimize conditions for plant growth. Different techniques are then used to evaluate optimality-degrees and comfort ratio of greenhouse micro-climate (i.e., air temperature, relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit) in order to reduce production risk prior to cultivation of a specific crop.

The idea of growing plants in environmentally controlled areas has existed since [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times. The Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] ate a [[Armenian cucumber|cucumber-like]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/aob/mcm242 | volume=100 | issue=7 | title=The Cucurbits of Mediterranean Antiquity: Identification of Taxa from Ancient Images and Descriptions | journal=Annals of Botany | pages=1441–1457 | pmid=17932073 | pmc=2759226 | last1 = Janick | first1 = J | last2 = Paris | first2 = HS | last3 = Parrish | first3 = DC | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; vegetable daily. &lt;!--Why?--&gt; The Roman gardeners used artificial methods (similar to the greenhouse system) of growing to have it available for his table every day of the year. Cucumbers were planted in wheeled carts which were put in the sun daily, then taken inside to keep them warm at night. The cucumbers were stored under frames or in cucumber houses glazed with either oiled cloth known as ''specularia'' or with sheets of [[Selenite (mineral)|selenite]] (a.k.a. ''lapis specularis''), according to the description by [[Pliny the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;Note:

Bohn, 1856), vol. 4, book 19, chapter 23: "Vegetables of a cartilaginous nature – cucumbers.  Pepones.", [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUoMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 156.]
*  The Roman poet [[Martial]] also briefly mentions greenhouses or cold frames in:  Martial with Walter C. A.

The first description of a heated greenhouse is from the ''[[Sanga Yorok]]'', a treatise on husbandry compiled by a royal physician of the [[Joseon]] dynasty of Korea during the 1450s
, in its chapter on cultivating vegetables during winter. The treatise contains detailed instructions on constructing a greenhouse that is capable of cultivating vegetables, forcing flowers, and ripening fruit within an artificially heated environment, by utilizing ''[[ondol]]'', the traditional Korean underfloor heating system, to maintain heat and humidity; cob walls to insulate heat; and semi-transparent oiled ''[[Korean paper|hanji]]'' windows to permit light penetration for plant growth and provide protection from the outside environment. The [[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]] confirm that greenhouse-like structures incorporating ''ondol'' were constructed to provide heat for [[mandarin orange]] trees during the winter of 1438.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yoon|first1=Sang Jun|last2=Woudstra|first2=Jan|title=Advanced Horticultural Techniques in Korea: The Earliest Documented Greenhouses|journal=Garden History|date=1 January 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=68–84|doi=10.2307/25472355|jstor=25472355|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of greenhouses also appeared in the [[Netherlands]] and then [[England]] in the 17th century, along with the plants. Some of these early attempts required enormous amounts of work to close up at night or to winterize. There were serious problems with providing adequate and balanced heat in these early greenhouses. Today, the [[Netherlands]] has many of the largest greenhouses in the world, some of them so vast that they are able to produce millions of vegetables every year.

The French botanist [[Charles Lucien Bonaparte]] is often credited with building the first practical modern greenhouse in [[Leiden]], Holland, during the 1800s to grow medicinal tropical plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeglasshouse.co.uk/news/history-of-the-greenhouse|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509082654/http://www.cambridgeglasshouse.co.uk/news/history-of-the-greenhouse|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 May 2013|title=Cambridge Glasshouse|location= Newport, North Humberside|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Originally only on the estates of the rich, the growth of the science of [[botany]] caused greenhouses to spread to the universities. The French called their first greenhouses ''orangeries'', since they were used to protect orange trees from freezing. As pineapples became popular, ''pineries'', or [[Pineapple Pit|pineapple pits]], were built.

Experimentation with the design of greenhouses continued during the 17th century in Europe, as technology produced better glass and construction techniques improved. The greenhouse at the [[Palace of Versailles]] was an example of their size and elaborateness; it was more than {{convert|150|m}} long, {{convert|13|m}} wide, and {{convert|14|m}} high.

The golden era of the greenhouse was in England during the Victorian era, where the largest glasshouses yet conceived were constructed, as the wealthy upper class and aspiring botanists competed to build the most elaborate buildings. A good example of this trend is the pioneering [[Kew Gardens]]. [[Joseph Paxton]], who had experimented with glass and iron in the creation of large greenhouses as the head gardener at [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]], in [[Derbyshire]], working for the [[Duke of Devonshire]], designed and built [[The Crystal Palace]] in [[London]], (although the latter was constructed for both horticultural and non-horticultural exhibition).

Other large greenhouses built in the 19th century included the [[New York Crystal Palace]], [[Munich]]’s [[Glaspalast (Munich)|Glaspalast]] and the [[Royal Greenhouses of Laeken]] (1874–1895) for [[King Leopold II of Belgium]].

In Japan, the first greenhouse was built in 1880 by [[Samuel Cocking]], a British merchant who exported [[herb]]s.

In the 20th century, the [[geodesic dome]] was added to the many types of greenhouses. Notable examples are the [[Eden Project]], in [[Cornwall]], [[The Rodale Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A dome grows in our garden|url=http://rodaleinstitute.org/2013/a-dome-grows-in-our-garden/|accessdate=9 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610021257/http://rodaleinstitute.org/2013/a-dome-grows-in-our-garden/|archivedate=10 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in Pennsylvania, the [[Climatron]] at the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]] in St. Louis, Missouri, and [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rounding Out the Waste Cycle: TMMK's On-Site Greenhouse|url=http://www.toyotageorgetown.com/enviro3.asp|work=TMMK and the Environment|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenhouse structures adapted in the 1960s when wider sheets of polyethylene film became widely available. Hoop houses were made by several companies and were also frequently made by the growers themselves. Constructed of aluminum extrusions, special galvanized steel tubing, or even just lengths of steel or PVC water pipe, construction costs were greatly reduced. This resulted in many more greenhouses being constructed on smaller farms and garden centers. Polyethylene film durability increased greatly when more effective UV-inhibitors were developed and added in the 1970s; these extended the usable life of the film from one or two years up to 3 and eventually 4 or more years.

Gutter-connected greenhouses became more prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s. These greenhouses have two or more bays connected by a common wall, or row of support posts. Heating inputs were reduced as the ratio of floor area to exterior wall area was increased substantially. Gutter-connected greenhouses are now commonly used both in production and in situations where plants are grown and sold to the public as well. Gutter-connected greenhouses are commonly covered with structured polycarbonate materials, or a double layer of polyethylene film with air blown between to provide increased heating efficiencies.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Theory of operation ===

The warmer temperature in a greenhouse occurs because incident [[solar radiation]] passes through the transparent roof and walls and is absorbed by the floor, earth, and contents, which become warmer. As the structure is not open to the atmosphere, the warmed air cannot escape via [[Convective heat transfer|convection]], so the temperature inside the greenhouse rises. This differs from the earth-oriented theory known as the "[[Greenhouse effect#Real greenhouses|greenhouse effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Physics'' (6 ed.), Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|9780199233991}}: "greenhouse effect"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Chemistry'' (6 ed.), edited by John Daintith, Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|9780199204632}}: "greenhouse effect"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, RW (1909).

Quantitative studies suggest that the effect of infrared radiative cooling is not negligibly small, and may have economic implications in a heated greenhouse. Analysis of issues of near-infrared radiation in a greenhouse with screens of a high coefficient of reflection concluded that installation of such screens reduced heat demand by about 8%, and application of dyes to transparent surfaces was suggested. Composite less-reflective glass, or less effective but cheaper anti-reflective coated simple glass, also produced savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://uwm.edu.pl/wnt/technicalsc/tech_17_4/b04.pdf|title= Energy Effects During Using the Glass with Different Properties in a Heated Greehouse|author= Sławomir Kurpaska|journal= Technical Sciences| volume= 17|issue=4 |date=2014|pages= 351–360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ventilation ===
[[Ventilation (architecture)|Ventilation]] is one of the most important components in a successful greenhouse. If there is no proper ventilation, greenhouses and their growing plants can become prone to problems. The main purposes of ventilation are to regulate the temperature and humidity to the optimal level, and to ensure movement of air and thus prevent build-up of plant pathogens (such as ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]'') that prefer still air conditions. Ventilation also ensures a supply of fresh air for photosynthesis and plant [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], and may enable important [[pollinators]] to access the greenhouse crop.

Ventilation can be achieved via use of vents - often controlled automatically via a computer - and recirculation fans.

=== Heating and cooling ===

[[Heating]] or [[electricity]] is one of the most considerable costs in the operation of greenhouses across the globe, especially in colder climates. The main problem with heating a greenhouse as opposed to a building that has solid [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] walls is the amount of heat lost through the greenhouse covering. Since the coverings need to allow light to filter into the structure, they conversely cannot insulate very well. With traditional plastic greenhouse coverings having an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] of around 2, a great amount of money is therefore spent to continually replace the heat lost. Most greenhouses, when supplemental heat is needed use natural gas or [[Electric heating|electric furnaces]].

Passive heating methods exist which seek heat using low energy input. [[Solar thermal collector|Solar energy can be captured]] from periods of relative abundance (day time/summer), and released to boost the temperature during cooler periods (night time/winter). [[Waste heat]] from livestock can also be used to heat greenhouses, e.g., placing a chicken coop inside a greenhouse recovers the heat generated by the chickens, which would otherwise be wasted.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Some greenhouses also rely on [[geothermal heating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/02/11/466050766/citrus-in-the-snow-geothermal-greenhouses-grow-local-produce-in-winter|title=Citrus In The Snow: Geothermal Greenhouses Grow Local Produce In Winter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooling is typically done by opening windows in the greenhouse when it gets too warm for the plants inside it. This can be done manually, or in an automated manner. Window actuators can open windows due to temperature difference&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hunecke-zubehoer.de/Vent-Opener-non-electric/Vent-Opener-up-to-7-kg/Automatic-Vent-Opener-H-29-no-electricity-needed::39.html?language=en Example of a non-electric window actuator]&lt;/ref&gt; or can be opened by [[Electronics|electronic]] controllers. Electronic controllers are often used to monitor the temperature and adjusts the furnace operation to the conditions. This can be as simple as a basic thermostat, but can be more complicated in larger greenhouse operations.

===Lighting===
During the day, light enters the greenhouse via the windows and is used by the plants. Some greenhouses are also equipped with [[grow light]]s (often LED lights) which are switched on at night to increase the amount of light the plants get, hereby increasing the yield with certain crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4823311 | pmid=27092163 | doi=10.3389/fpls.2016.00448 | volume=7 | title=Nighttime Supplemental LED Inter-lighting Improves Growth and Yield of Single-Truss Tomatoes by Enhancing Photosynthesis in Both Winter and Summer | year=2016 | journal=Front Plant Sci | page=448 | last1 = Tewolde | first1 = FT | last2 = Lu | first2 = N | last3 = Shiina | first3 = K | last4 = Maruo | first4 = T | last5 = Takagaki | first5 = M | last6 = Kozai | first6 = T | last7 = Yamori | first7 = W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carbon dioxide enrichment ===

The possibility of using [[carbon dioxide]] enrichment in greenhouse cultivation to enhance plant growth has been known for nearly 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;E. Reinau, ''Praktische Kohlensäuredüngung'', Springer, Berlin, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Brijer, "Een verlaten goudmijn: koolzuurbemesting".

For example, Cornerways Nursery in the UK is strategically placed near a major sugar refinery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishsugar.co.uk/tomatoes.aspx|title=Products and Services, tomatoes|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624042707/http://www.britishsugar.co.uk/Tomatoes.aspx|archivedate=24 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consuming both waste heat and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the refinery which would otherwise be vented to atmosphere. The refinery reduces its carbon emissions, whilst the nursery enjoys boosted tomato yields and does not need to provide its own greenhouse heating.

Enrichment only becomes effective where, by [[Liebig's law]], carbon dioxide has become the [[limiting factor]]. In a controlled greenhouse, [[irrigation]] may be trivial, and soils may be [[Soil fertility|fertile]] by default. In less-controlled gardens and open fields, [[Keeling Curve|rising CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels]] only increase [[primary production]] to the point of soil depletion (assuming no droughts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buis|first1=A|title=NASA Finds Drought May Take Toll on Congo Rainforest|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-124|website=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buis|first1=A|title=Study Finds Severe Climate Jeopardizing Amazon Forest|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-025|website=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=BI|last2=Ault|first2=TR|last3=Smerdon|first3=J.

== Types ==
[[File:!!! Palazzo Scicluna, now Parisio 06.jpg|thumb|Recreational Greenhouse at [[Palazzo Parisio (Naxxar)|Palazzo Parisio]], Malta.]]
In domestic greenhouses, the glass used is typically 3mm (or ⅛″) 'horticultural glass' grade, which is good quality glass that should not contain air bubbles (which can produce scorching on leaves by acting like lenses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Garden DIY Expert |author=Hessayon, DG |authorlink = D. G. Hessayon|publisher=pbi Publications |year=1992 |page=104 |isbn=978-0-903505-37-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastics mostly used are [[polyethylene]] film and multiwall sheets of [[polycarbonate]] material, or PMMA [[acrylic glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aluminium greenhouses|url=https://www.swgreenhouses.co.uk/blog/the-benefits-of-aluminium-greenhouses.html|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial glass greenhouses are often high-tech production facilities for vegetables or flowers. The glass greenhouses are filled with equipment such as screening installations, heating, cooling and lighting, and may be automatically controlled by a computer.

===Dutch Light===

In the UK and other Northern European countries a pane of horticultural glass referred to as "Dutch Light" was historically used as a standard unit of construction, having dimensions of 28¾″ x 56″ (approx. 730mm x 1422&amp;nbsp;mm). This size gives a larger glazed area when compared with using smaller panes such as the 600mm width typically used in modern domestic designs which then require more supporting framework for a given overall greenhouse size. A style of greenhouse having sloped sides (resulting in a wider base than at eaves height) and using these panes uncut is also often referred to as of "Dutch Light design", and a [[cold frame]] using a full- or half-pane as being of "Dutch" or "half-Dutch" size.

== Uses ==

Greenhouses allow for greater control over the growing environment of plants. Depending upon the technical specification of a greenhouse, key factors which may be controlled include temperature, levels of light and shade, [[irrigation]], [[fertilizer]] application, and atmospheric [[humidity]]. Greenhouses may be used to overcome shortcomings in the growing qualities of a piece of land, such as a short growing season or poor light levels, and they can thereby improve food production in marginal environments.  Greenhouses in hot, dry climates used specifically to provide shade are sometimes called "shadehouses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shade houses|url=http://www.harnois.com/en/shadehouse/shade-houses.html|accessdate=3 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610204624/http://www.harnois.com/en/shadehouse/shade-houses.html|archive-date=10 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Wicking_boxes Wicking_beds Our_standard_shade_house Macro-pots_and_small_beds Our Standard Shade-house|url=http://www.easygrowvegetables.net/Our_standard_shade_house.html|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plastic sea, Almería Spain.jpg|thumbnail|Greenhouses in [[Almería]] as seen from space. Credit: [[NASA]]]]
As they may enable certain crops to be grown throughout the year, greenhouses are increasingly important in the food supply of high-latitude countries. One of the largest complexes in the world is in [[Province of Almería|Almería]], [[Andalucía]], [[Spain]], where greenhouses cover almost {{convert|200|km2|acre|abbr=on}}.

Greenhouses are often used for growing [[floriculture|flowers]], [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, and [[Transplanting|transplants]]. Special greenhouse varieties of certain crops, such as tomatoes, are generally used for commercial production. Many vegetables and flowers can be grown in greenhouses in late winter and early spring, and then transplanted outside as the weather warms. [[Bumblebee]]s are the [[pollinator]]s of choice for most [[pollination]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} although other types of [[bee]]s have been used, as well as artificial pollination. [[Hydroponics]] (especially hydroponic [[A-frame]]s) can be used to make the most use of the interior space.

The relatively closed environment of a greenhouse has its own unique management requirements, compared with outdoor production. [[Pest (animal)|Pests]] and [[disease]]s, and extremes of heat and humidity, have to be controlled, and irrigation is necessary to provide water. Most greenhouses use sprinklers or drip lines. Significant inputs of heat and light may be required, particularly with winter production of warm-weather vegetables.

Greenhouses also have applications outside of the [[agriculture]] industry. [[GlassPoint Solar]], located in [[Fremont, California]], encloses solar fields in greenhouses to produce steam for [[Solar Enhanced Oil Recovery|solar-enhanced oil recovery]]. For example, in November 2017 GlassPoint announced that it is developing a [[Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery|solar enhanced oil recovery]] facility near Bakersfield, CA that uses greenhouses to enclose its [[parabolic trough]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solarpaces.org/glasspoint-brings-gigantic-850-mwth-solar-eor-to-california/|title=GlassPoint Belridge Solar Project|last=|first=|date=2017-11-30|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Alpine house}}
An "alpine house" is a specialized greenhouse used for growing [[alpine plant]]s. The purpose of an alpine house is to mimic the conditions in which alpine plants grow; particularly to provide protection from wet conditions in winter. Alpine houses are often unheated, since the plants grown there are hardy, or require at most protection from hard frost in the winter. They are designed to have excellent ventilation.&lt;ref name=Grif85&gt;{{Citation |last=Griffith |first=Anna N. |year=1985 |title=Collins Guide to Alpines and Rock Garden Plants |location=London |publisher=Collins |isbn=978-0-907486-81-7 |pages=20–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption ==
Worldwide, there's an estimated 9 million acres of greenhouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNutty|first1=Jennifer|title=Solar greenhouses generate electricity and grow crops at the same time, UC Santa Cruz study reveals|url=https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/11/loik-greenhouse.html|accessdate=6 November 2017|work=USC Newscenter|publisher=University of California |location=Santa Cruz|date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
[[File:TomateJungpflanzenAnzuchtNiederlande.jpg|thumb|Young tomatoes in an industrial-sized greenhouse in the Netherlands]]
The [[Netherlands]] has some of the largest greenhouses in the world. Such is the scale of food production in the country that in 2000, greenhouses occupied 10,526 hectares, or 0.25% of the total land area.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
[[File:Westland kassen.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Greenhouses in the [[Westland (region), Netherlands|Westland region]].]]
Greenhouses began to be built in the [[Westland (region), Netherlands|Westland region]] of the Netherlands in the mid-19th century. The addition of sand to bogs and clay soil created fertile soil for agriculture, and around 1850, grapes were grown in the first greenhouses, simple glass constructions with one of the sides consisting of a solid wall. By the early 20th century, greenhouses began to be constructed with all sides built using glass, and they began to be heated. This also allowed for the production of fruits and vegetables that did not ordinarily grow in the area. Today, the Westland and the area around [[Aalsmeer]] have the highest concentration of greenhouse agriculture in the world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The Westland produces mostly vegetables, besides plants and flowers; Aalsmeer is noted mainly for the production of flowers and potted plants. Since the 20th century, the area around [[Venlo]] and parts of [[Drenthe]] have also become important regions for greenhouse agriculture.

Since 2000, technical innovations include the "closed greenhouse", a completely closed system allowing the grower complete control over the growing process while using less energy. Floating greenhouses{{Clarify|what are these?|date=October 2012}} are used in watery areas of the country.

The Netherlands has around 4,000 greenhouse enterprises that operate over 9,000 hectares&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?VW=T&amp;DM=SLNL&amp;PA=80780NED&amp;D1=295-296,299-300,303,305,309,311,317,320-321,323,326-327,332,338-339,360,363-364&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0,5,(l-2),(l-1),l&amp;HD=150529-1850&amp;HDR=G1,G2&amp;STB=T|title=  gewassen, dieren en grondgebruik naar regio|publisher=CBS StatLine – Landbouw|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of greenhouses and employ some 150,000 workers, producing €7.2 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?VW=T&amp;DM=SLNL&amp;PA=80785NED&amp;D1=a&amp;D2=a&amp;D3=0-1,7,17,21,30,38,40,43&amp;D4=0,7,13-14&amp;HD=150529-1858&amp;HDR=T,G3&amp;STB=G2,G1|title= economische omvang naar omvangsklasse, bedrijfstype|publisher=CBS StatLine – Landbouw|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; worth of vegetables, fruit, plants, and flowers, some 80% of which is exported.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''Kékes''' {{IPA-hu|ˈkeːkɛʃ|}} is [[Hungary]]'s [[List of elevation extremes by country|highest]] [[mountain]], at {{convert|1015|m|}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=pb/&gt; It lies {{convert|12|km}} northeast of [[Gyöngyös]],&lt;ref name="Földvary"&gt;{{cite book |author=G. Z. Földvary |year=1988 |title=Geology of the Carpathian Region |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-9971-5-0345-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7dNVzg4UHIC&amp;pg=PA278}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Mátra]] range of [[Heves County|Heves county]]. It is Hungary's third most popular [[tourist attraction]], after [[Lake Balaton]] and the [[Danube]], and has a number of hotels and skiing [[piste]]s. The [[Kékestető TV Tower]] stands at the summit.

The name ''Kékes'' is derived from the mountain's often bluish colour. In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the word ''{{lang|hu|kék}}'' means 'blue', while ''{{lang|hu|kékes}}'' means implicitly 'bluish'.

==Road cycling==
For [[road bicycle racing]] enthusiasts, the mountain can be climbed by two main routes.

* South from [[Gyöngyös]]: 839 m over 17.8&amp;nbsp;km. This is the most famous and difficult ascent. 
* North from [[Parád]]: 775 m over 16.9&amp;nbsp;km. About equal in difficulty as the Bédoin ascent, but better sheltered against the climb.

The flat country is reclaimed marshland, similar to but not part of the [[Agro Pontino]]. It is now called the South Pontino. The [[Via Appia]] went through this region on its way south to [[Campania]], which is located beyond the mountains seen in the distance.]]
'''Latium adiectum''' or '''Latium Novum''' is an ancient Roman geographical term used at least as early as the 1st century AD, when mention of it occurs in [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in conjunction with Latium antiquum, the original territory of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latini]] tribe. Says Pliny of the latter:&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'', III.56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Its inhabitants have often changed: at various times it has been occupied by various peoples - the Aborigines, the Pelasgi, the Arcades, the Siculi, the [[Aurunci]], the [[Rutuli]] ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Then he speaks of a later extension to the river [[Garigliano]], to include the [[Volsci]], [[Osci]] and [[Ausones]]. The "last town" in the Adiectum Latium, or "Extension of Latium", was [[Sinuessa]].&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'', III.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny's remarks concerning Latium are part of his description of [[Italy]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'', III.39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"...a land which is at once the nurseling and the mother of all other lands, chosen by providence of the gods to make heaven itself more glorious, to unite scattered empires, to make manners gentle, to draw together in converse by community of language the jarring and uncouth tongues of so many nations, to give mankind civilization, and in a word to become throughout the world the single fatherland of all the races."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After waxing yet more eloquent concerning Italy - he was in fact north Italian himself, rather than Roman - he then gives:&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'', III.46.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"an account of a circuit of Italy, and of its cities. Herein it is necessary to premise that we intend to follow the authority of his late Majesty Augustus, and to adopt the division that he made of the whole of Italy into eleven regions ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Latium and Campania together comprise Region I, of which Latium is divided into Latium Vetus or Antiquus and Latium Adiectum or Novum.

==Geography of Old Latium==
{{main|Old Latium}}

==Geography of New Latium==
It included the Hernican cities of [[Anagnia]], [[Ferentinum]], [[Aletrium]], and [[Verulae]], a group of mountain strongholds on the north side of the valley of the [[Trerus]] (Sacco); together with the Volscian cities on the south of the same valley, and in that of the [[Liris]], the whole of which, with the exception of its extreme upper end, was included in the Volscian territory. Here were situated [[Segni|Signia]], [[Frusino]], [[San Giovanni Incarico|Fabrateria]], [[Fregellae]], [[Sora, Italy|Sora]], [[Arpinum]], [[Atina, Lazio|Atina]], [[Aquinum]], [[Casinum]], and [[Liri River|Interamna]]; Anxur ([[Terracina]]) was the only seaport that properly belonged to the Volscians, the coast from there to the mouth of the Liris being included in the territory of the [[Aurunci]], or Ausones as they were termed by [[Greek literature|Greek]] writers, who possessed the maritime towns of [[Fondi|Fundi]], [[Formiae]], [[Caieta]], and [[Minturnae]], together with [[Suessa]] in the interior, which had replaced their more ancient capital of [[Aurunca]]. Sinuessa, on the seacoast between the [[Liris]] (Garigliano) and the [[Volturno|Vulturnus]], at the foot of the [[Monte Massico|Mons Massicus]], was the last town in Latium according to the official use of the term and was sometimes assigned to [[Campania]], while Suessa was more assigned to Latium. On the other hand, as Nissen points out (Italische Landeskunde, ii. 554), the [[Pons Campanus]], by which the [[Via Appia]] crossed the [[Savo (river)|Savo]] some 9 m. SE of Sinuessa, indicates by its name the position of the old Campanian frontier. In the interior the boundary fell between Casinum and [[Teanum Sidicinum]], at about the 100th [[milestone]] of the Via Latina, a fact which led later to the jurisdiction of the [[Rome|Roman]] courts being extended on every side to the 100th mile from the city, and to this being the limit beyond which banishment from Rome was considered to begin.

Though the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] comprised within the boundaries of Latium do not rise to a height approaching that of the loftiest summits of the central range, they attain to a considerable altitude, and form steep and rugged mountain masses from 4,000 to 5,000 ft. high. They are traversed by three principal valleys: (1) that of the Anio, now called [[Aniene]] (and formerly [[Teverone]]), which descends from above [[Subiaco, Italy|Subiaco]] to [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]], where it enters the plain of the [[Campagna]]; (2) that of the Trerus ([[Sacco]]), which has its source below Palestrina ([[Praeneste]]), and flows through a comparatively broad valley that separates the main mass of the Apennines from the Volscian mountains or [[Monti Lepini]], until it joins the Liris below [[Ceprano]]; (3) that of the Liris ([[Garigliano]]), which enters the confines of New Latium about 20 m. from its source, flows past the town of [[Sora, Italy|Sora]], and has a very tortuous course from there to the sea at [[Minturnae]]; its lower valley is for the most part of considerable width, and forms a fertile tract of considerable extent, bordered on both sides by hills covered with vines, olives and fruit trees, and thickly studded with towns and villages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5612">This is a '''list of geocoding systems''', in the sense of schemes that assign systematic labels to geographic entities.

This is ''not'' a list of software systems that can perform [[geocoding]] in the sense of turning a geographic name into a [[latitude]] and [[longitude]].

Some of these code systems are free for use, others have different [[licence]]s.

==Administrative==
Codes with only partial coverture of the globe, mainlly for "administrative regions", like countries or biomes.
 
'''General''' use:
*[[ISO 3166-1]] and [[ISO 3166-2]]: country codes and codes of its subdivisions
*[[Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes|HASC]] (Hierarchical Administrative Subdivision Codes)
*[[ONS coding system|ONS]] code, [[United Kingdom|UK]] only, administrative
*[[MARC country code]]s
*[[Standard Geographical Classification code (Canada)|SGC codes]], [[Canada]] only, statistical
*[[UN M.49]] region codes, area code, continents, countries (like [[ISO 3166-1 numeric]])

'''Airport''' codes:

*[[IATA airport code]]s, area /point codes, airports and 3-letter city codes 
*[[ICAO airport code]]s, area /point codes, airports

'''Internet''' codes: [[IANA country code]]s similar to [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]

'''Sport''' codes: [[IOC country code]]s, area, worldwide

'''Environment''' codes: [[Longhurst code]], a set of four-letter codes used in ecological geography

=== National standards ===
*  [[United States|U.S.]], '''FIPS''' codes:
**[[FIPS country code]]s (FIPS 10-4), area code, administrative, free
**[[FIPS place code]]s (FIPS 55) [[United States|U.S.]] only, free
**[[FIPS county code]]s (FIPS 6-4) US only, free
**[[FIPS state code]]s (FIPS 5-2) US only

==Geodesy==
:Summarized from [[Discrete_Global_Grid#Geocoding_variants|Discrete Global Grid]]

Popular or in "official use":

*[[ISO 6709]] Standard Representation for Geographic Point Location by Coordinates
*[[Universal Transverse Mercator|UTM]]
*[[Geohash]] and [[Geohash-36]] open-source [[hash function|hash]] notation for locations
*[[Open Location Code]] (PlusCode)
*[[What3words]], patent-restrictions system, converts 3x3 meter squares into 3 words &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What3words: Find and share very precise locations via Google Maps with just 3 words|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/07/02/what3words-a-new-way-to-search-for-and-share-locations-via-google-maps-with-just-3-words-universal-address-system/|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old or "low use":

*[[C-squares]] - compact encoding of geographic coordinate bounds (latitude-longitude)

*[[World Geographic Reference System]] (GEOREF), a military / air navigation coordinate system for point and area identification

*Geotude, converts latitude and longitude to a single string

*[[Global Area Reference System]] (GARS), reference system developed by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)

*[[Military Grid Reference System]] (MGRS), derived from UTM and UPS grids by NATO with a unique naming convention

*[[Munich Orientation Convention]], converts lat/lon to metrical monopolar codes for targets, crossings, stations, stop points, bridges, tunnels, towns, islands, volcanoes, highway exits etc. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navipedia.org/index.php/Step By Step Navigation|Navipedia / ESA]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*S2, a geocoding scheme using [[spherical geometry]] and the space-filling [[Hilbert curve]], developed at [[Google]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://s2geometry.io/about/overview|title=Overview|website=s2geometry.io|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/s2-cells-and-space-filling-curves-keys-to-building-better-digital-map-tools-for-cities-a312aa5e2f59|title=S2 cells and space-filling curves: Keys to building better digital map tools for cities|last=Kreiss|first=Sven|date=2016-07-27|website=Medium|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[World Meteorological Organization squares|WMO squares]]

*{{anchor|GEOID}}GEOID, the name of [[United States Census Bureau]] geographic identifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/geoidentifiers.html | title = Understanding Geographic Identifiers (GEOIDs) | website = [[United States Census Bureau]] | accessdate = March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telephony &amp; radio broadcasting==
*[[ITU letter codes|ITU-R country code]]s
*[[ITU-T country calling code]]s
*[[ITU-T mobile calling code]]s
*[[Maidenhead Locator System]] (used by amateur radio operators)
*[[Marsden Square]]s

==Postal address==
*[[Postal code]]s, area, worldwide, country-codes by [[UPU]], free
*[[Natural Area Code|NAC]], area codes (area can be indefinitely small)
*[[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] area code, partially administrative, worldwide: countries, Europe : country to community
*[[Postal addresses in the Republic of Ireland#OpenPostcode|OpenPostcode]], opensource global algorithm (local adaptations as Irish &amp; Hong Kong postcodes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OpenPostcode.org|url=http://www.openpostcode.org|accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Munich Orientation Convention]]

==Mapping not geodesy==
*[[WOEID]]
*[[OpenStreetMap]] shortlink, used as a short permanent link to map locations
*[[QDGC|Quarter Degree Grid Cells]]
*[[UN M.49]] region codes, area code, continents, countries (like [[ISO 3166-1 numeric]])

===The 1:50,000 series===
Between the early 1950s and the late 1970s the UK [[Directorate of Overseas Surveys]] published several editions of a series of maps of Jamaica at the scale of 1:50,000. The following table summarises the known publication dates. Online copies can be found on Commons or at the University of Texas Libraries.

The following is a list of known [[Orogeny|orogenies]] organised by continent, starting with the oldest at the top. The organization of this article is along present-day continents that do not necessarily reflect the geography contemporary to the orogenies. Note that some orogenies encompass more than one continent and might have different names in each continent. Like-wise some very large orogenies include a number of sub-orogenies. As with other geological phenomena orogenies are often subject to different and changing interpretations regarding to their age, type and associated [[paleogeography]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="551">A '''lost toponym''' is a [[toponym|name given to a place]] which is no longer known or identifiable. For example, in 1618 the crew of the ''Mauritius'' explored a river in north-western Australia, which they named ''Willems Revier'' ("Willem's River"). However it is not now known which river they explored, so ''Willems River'' cannot be placed on a present-day map. ''Willems River'' is therefore a lost toponym.  [[Tibet]] is one such real life example.

'''Lágheiði''' is a heath between [[Ólafsfjörður]] and [[Fljót]]. 
Through the centuries this has been the route between this two settlements. 
Road was built over the heath in 1945 and it was the first driving connection with Ólafsfjörður. Due to heavy snows in the winter the road was generally closed from September to may.
One folktale is known from the heath - Dýrhóll.

'''Mahakoshal''' is a [[list of regions of India|region]] of central [[India]]. Mahakoshal lies in the upper or eastern reaches of the [[Narmada River]] valley in the Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. [[Jabalpur]] is the largest city in the region. [[Nimar]] region lies to the west, in the lower reaches of the Narmada valley.

Mahakoshal is mainly a [[Hindi language|Hindi]]-speaking area. Other languages used in the region include [[Standard Hindi]], [[Gondi language|Gondi]], and [[Marathi language|Marathi]].

==Geography==
The [[Vindhya Range]] forms the northern boundary of the region; north of the Vindhya Range lie the regions of [[Malwa]] to the northwest, [[Bundelkhand]] to the north, and [[Bagelkhand]] to the northeast. [[Chhattisgarh]] state lies to the east, and the [[Vidarbha]] region of [[Maharashtra]] state lies to the south across the [[Satpura Range]]. Cities and districts of the region include [[Jabalpur]], [[Katni]], [[Narsinghpur]], [[Mandla]], [[Dindori, Madhya Pradesh|Dindori]], [[Seoni]] and [[Chhindwara]].

==History==
Dynasties that have held the territory include the [[Gondi people|Gonds,]] [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]], [[Satavahana]]s, and [[Maratha]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, William Wilson, Sir, et al. (1908). ''[[Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', Volume 6. 1908-1931; Clarendon Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[British Raj]] Mahakoshal was part of the [[Central Provinces]] which contained two distinct linguistic regions: Mahakoshal and [[Vidarbha]]. The two linguistic regions could not be fully integrated as a unit owing to regional and cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;Raghaw Raman Pateriya, ''Provincial Legislatures and the National Movement''. Northern Book Centre, 1992. pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demand for a Separate State==
It is highly demanded state from an undivided Madhya Pradesh due to lack of recognition and development. An initiative has been started by MP High Court Bar council with a demand of a new state of "Rewakhand" with 25 districts of Mahakaushal and Bundelkhand.

'''Malcolm Ian Logan''', [[Order of Australia|AC]] is an Australian geographer and university administrator. He was Vice-Chancellor of [[Monash University]] from 1987-1996.

Logan grew up in country [[New South Wales]], attending secondary school in the remote town of [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]]. He moved to Sydney to complete an honours degree in geography at the [[University of Sydney]], which he finished in 1951. After spending some time as a teacher in secondary schools, he returned to Sydney to complete his PhD and take up a position as Professor of Geography and Urban Planning. He then spent time at a range of universities overseas, living in the US and Nigeria. Later in his career, he became involved in both the [[World Bank]] and the [[OECD]] as an adviser on urban planning.

In 1971, Sir [[Louis Matheson]], then Vice-Chancellor of Monash, invited Logan to take up a professorship at Monash. Although Logan knew little about Monash at the time, he wanted to return to Australia, and chose the University because it seemed "the liveliest and brightest place". Once there, he quickly raised through the administrative ranks, first as Pro Vice-Chancellor and then, in 1987, he was appointed Vice-Chancellor.

His leadership at Monash marked the most drastic expansion of a University in Australian history. Prompted by the [[Dawkins reforms]], Logan aggressively pursued Monash's takeover of a number of tertiary institutions. He was attracted to the notion of a "multiversity", similar to the big state universities in the US, such as the [[University of California]] and the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eduweb.vic.gov.au/edulibrary/public/highered/Monash_Com_engagement_July05jw.pdf Microsoft Word - Monash case study final.doc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414103527/http://www.eduweb.vic.gov.au/edulibrary/public/highered/Monash_Com_engagement_July05jw.pdf |date=2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monash went from one campus in [[Clayton, Victoria|Clayton]] with 20,000 students, to 6 Victorian campuses with 40,000 students. Through Logan's close personal relationships with members of the [[Hawke Government|Hawke]] and [[Keating Government|Keating]] governments, Logan was able to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to develop the new campuses.

He also argued that Australia's future lay in Asia. Consequently, he established a Monash teaching presence in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia and Laos. He also oversaw the massive increase in international students at Monash, particularly from Asia. He established the university's link with the [[Sunway Group]], a relationship which led to the establishment of a Monash Malaysia Campus in 1998. With the increased inflow of international students, Monash's income increased dramatically, such that its annual reports were often discussed in financial newspapers. Reportedly, Logan was fond of citing the fact that Monash's annual budget was greater than the State of [[Tasmania]]'s. In the year that he retired, 1996, he became a Companion of the Order of Australia ([[Order of Australia|AC]]), the highest honour which can be awarded to an Australian citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Marginson, Monash: Remaking the University, Allen &amp; Unwin, 2000, pp. 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4471">[[File:Coat of arms of Transnistria.svg|thumb|[[Coat of arms of Transnistria]]]]
Although most commonly known in English as Transnistria, the official name of the region is [[Pridnestrovie]]. Here is a detailed explanation of the '''names''' used '''for Transnistria''', both official and unofficial, as they appear in the local languages and in English.

==Official names, long==
Transnistria has three official languages: [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Moldovan language|Moldavian]] (in the Cyrillic alphabet),  and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]. In each of the three national languages the name reads: 
 
*Russian: Приднестровская Молдавская Республика (Pridnestrovskaya Moldavskaya Respublika), abbreviated ПМР
*Moldavian Cyrillic: Република Молдовеняскэ Нистрянэ (Republica Moldovenească Nistreană), abbreviated РМН
*Ukrainian: Придністровська Молдавська Республіка (rydnistrovs'ka Moldavs'ka Respublika), abbreviated ПМР

The abbreviations of each name in the official languages also appear on the Transnistrian [[Coat of arms of Transnistria|coat of arms]].

The [[Constitution of Transnistria]] gives the official name as Pridnestrovskaia Moldavskaia Respublica (PMR).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://mfa-pmr.org/index.php?newsid=644 Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authorities, such as the [[President of Transnistria|President's office]], translate this name to English as the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic. The official abbreviation in English is PMR.

==Official names, short==
The official shortform name (the name in daily usage) in Russian is "Приднестровье", Pridnestrovie, which literally means "Cisdniestria". Short name in Moldavian is Нистрения - ''Nistrenia'', in Ukrainian Придністров'я - ''Prydnistrovya''. 

The PMR government favours not to translate the country name when written in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pridnestrovie.info/news/whats-in-a-name-pridnestrovie-vs-transnistria What's in a name: "Pridnestrovie" vs "Transnistria"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721231952/http://pridnestrovie.info/news/whats-in-a-name-pridnestrovie-vs-transnistria |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Per a 2000 presidential naming decree, the official transliteration in Latin script is Pridnestrovie.

==Other names in use==
In Russian, the names used for Transnistria are always consistently either Pridnestrovskaia Moldavskaia Respublica or Pridnestrovie (the two official names, long- and short- respectively). However, in English a wide variety of names have been used to describe the region, among them: Trans-Dniester, Transdnistria, Transdniestria, Transdniestr, Trans-Dniestria, Transdniester, Transniestria, Transdnestr, also Trans-Dnjestr and Trans-Dnjester.

The government of [[Moldova]] refers to the region Stînga Nistrului, which means "Left Bank of the Dniester" although in the [[Moldovan language|Moldavian Latin script]], the official name is Republica Moldovenească Nistreană (which translates to English as "Nistrian Moldavian Republic"). 

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] used the name Moldavian Republic of Transdniestria or Moldovan Republic of Transnistria (MRT), while [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and others sometimes refer to it as the Transnistrian Moldovan Republic (TMR). Author Charles King, in his book ''The Moldovans'', uses the names Dnestr Republic and Dnestr Moldovan Republic (DMR).

==Naming background==
All of the names cited above have their root in the name of the river [[Dniester]]. In Romanian/Moldavian, the river is known as [[Nistru]]. The name "Transnistria" is Romanian/Moldavian and literally means "beyond the river Dniester". The name has been in use in Romania as early as 1924, but it was [[Transnistria (World War II)|popularized internationally during World War II]].

In both Russian and Ukrainian, the name has a more literal meaning as it is called "Cisdniestria" which means "On ''this'' side of the Dniester", "By-The-Dniester" or "On-The-Dniester" (as opposed to ''beyond'' the Dniester).

The Nawab of Bengal shifted the capital from Dhaka to Murshidabad in the early-18th century. With the rise of Calcutta (now Kolkata) during the British rule, Dhaka began to decline and came to be known as the "City of Magnificent Ruins".

{{main|History of Dhaka}}
The existence of a settlement in the area that is now Dhaka dates from the 7th century. The city area was ruled by the Buddhist kingdom of [[Kamarupa]] and the [[Pala Empire]] before passing to the control of the [[Hindu]] [[Sena dynasty]] in the 9th century. The name of the town may have derived after the establishment of the Goddess [[Dhakeshwari Temple|Dhakeshvari]]'s temple by Ballal Sena in the 12th century.

After the [[Sena Empire]], Dhaka was successively ruled by the [[Sultanate of Bengal]] as well as interruption{{clarify|date=April 2012}} of governors from the [[Delhi Sultanate]] before being taken over by the [[Mughals]] in 1608. Dhaka started to grow from 1610 under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Subedhars.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/allure-of-old-dhaka-32555|title=Allure of Old Dhaka|date=2014-07-11|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest standing mosque was built in 1454 by Bakht Binat during the rule of [[Mahmud Shah (Sultan of Bengal)|Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The development of townships and housing has resulted in a significant growth in population came as the city was proclaimed the capital (Rajmahal) of Subah Bangalah under Mughal rule in 1608. Mughal Subahdar Islam Khan was the first administrator of the city. Khan named the town "Jahangir Nagar" (জাহাঙ্গীর নগর; City of Jahangir) in honour of the Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]], although this name was dropped soon after Jahangir's death. [[Farashganj]] (French town) was settled by the French 1780, then known as French Market. The area is known for its 19th and early 20th century mansions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/magazine/2016/11/26/farashganj-lost-history/|title=Farashganj, a lost history {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|date=2016-11-26|work=Dhaka Tribune|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farashganj also had the presence of French East India Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/lifestyle/cover-story/edifices-the-past-1290313|title=Edifices of the past|date=2016-09-27|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th and 19th century saw significant number of [[Armenians]] settle down in [[Armanitola]], then a predominantly Armenian neighborhood.

[[Image:San Juan Promenade.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The Priority Bus Route in [[San Juan, Trinidad and Tobago|San Juan]]]]
The '''Priority Bus Route''' (or PBR) is a public transit corridor roadway on [[Trinidad]] island in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. 

It is dedicated to use only by [[bus]]es, [[maxi taxi]]s, and [[emergency vehicle]]s. Private vehicles can use the road, but only if the owner possesses a special pass required to do so.

==Route==
The route serves the [[East–West Corridor]] metro region, from the city of [[Port of Spain]] from the west, to the borough of [[Arima]] to the east.

It was built on the right of way of the former [[Trinidad Government Railway]] line. The Priority Bus Route is parallel to the public [[Eastern Main Road]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3190">A '''reef knoll''' is a land-based landform that comprises an immense pile of [[calcareous]] material that accumulated on a previously existing ancient sea floor.&lt;ref&gt;Cope, F. Wolverson (1976) ''Geology Explained in the Peak District'', David &amp; Charles&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its accumulation it may have had enough structure from [[organism]]s such as [[sea sponge|sponge]]s to have been free-standing and to withstand the [[sea current]]s as material accumulated, and was likely an [[atoll]]. Another possibility is the remains of [[deep water coral]].  Such structures are thus often [[fossil]]-rich.

==England==

Examples on the [[Derbyshire]]/[[Staffordshire]] border include [[Thorpe Cloud]] and [[Bunster Hill]] in southern [[Dovedale]], and also [[Chrome Hill]] and [[Parkhouse Hill]] at the northern end.

These structures are often most clearly seen where the surrounding rocks are much softer and so can be preferentially [[erosion|eroded]]. All the Derbyshire examples quoted lie at the edge of the [[limestone]] areas; Chrome and Parkhouse lie at the divide between limestone and the much softer [[shale]]. 

Examples in the [[Yorkshire Dales]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ramsbottom |first=W.H.C. |author2=R.F.Goosens |author3=E.G. Smith |author4=M.A. Calver |editor=D.H. Rayner and J.E.

There is one set located around Thorpe (Skelterton, Butter Haw, Stebden, Elbolton, Thorpe Kail, Myra Bank and Hartlington Kail); one set located around Malham (Burns Hill, Cawden, and Wedber); and a set around Settle (High Hill and Scaleber).

It was one proposed that in Lancashire, reef knolls could be seen between the villages of [[Worston]] and [[Downham, Lancashire|Downham]] near [[Clitheroe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/geological/sites/area_ID20.asp |title=English Nature: Lancashire Geology |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702162405/http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/geological/sites/area_ID20.asp |archivedate=2 July 2007 |accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- refers to pre 1972 theory--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=J.|last2=Grayson|first2=R.F.|title=Origin and structure of Lower Viséan "reef"limestones near Clitheroe, Lancashire|journal=Proceedings of the Yorkshire Geological Society|date=1972|volume=38|pages=607–638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crb&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kabrna|first1=Paul|title=Clitheroe Reef Belt|url=http://www.kabrna.com/cpgs/craven/reef_belt.htm|website=Craven Basin:Waulsortian Mudmounds|publisher=Craven &amp; Pendle Geological Society|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8777">The [[Nahua people]] such as the [[Aztec mythology|Aztecs]], [[Chichimecs]] and the [[Toltecs]] believed that the heavens were constructed and separated into 13 levels, usually called '''Topan''' or simply each one '''Ilhuicatl iohhui''', '''Ilhuicatl iohtlatoquiliz'''. Each level had from one to many Lords (gods) living in and ruling them.

{{main|Aztec mythology}}

In [[Aztec mythology]], the '''Thirteen Heavens''' were formed out of [[Cipactli]]'s head when the gods made creation out of its body, whereas [[:es:Tlaltícpac|Tlaltícpac]], the earth, was made from its center and the nine levels of the underworld ([[Mictlan]]) from its tail.&lt;ref name="Fernández1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adela Fernández|title=Dioses prehispánicos de México: mitos y deidades del panteón náhuatl|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FG45qSQgDwwC|date=1 January 1992|publisher=Panorama Editorial|isbn=978-968-38-0306-1|pages=30, 33, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important of these heavens was [[Omeyocan]] (Place of Two), where [[Ometeotl]] - the dual Lord, creator of the Dual-Genesis who, as male, takes the name Ometecuhtli (Two Lord), and as female is named Omecihuatl (Two Lady) - resided.

The '''Trillion dollar club''' is an unofficial classification of the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|world's major economies]] with a [[gross domestic product]] (nominal GDP) of more than US$1 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2007/04/26/india-trillion-mark-markets-econ-cx_rd_0426markets24.html Welcome to the Trillion Dollar Club] - [[Forbes.com]] 26 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/04/27/stories/2007042708181700.htm Indian joins the Trillion Dollar Club] - ''[[The Hindu]]'' 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2017 it  included 16 countries.

Due to the world financial crisis, South Korea and Australia exited the trillion dollar club as their nominal GDPs shrank below $1 trillion in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Australia rejoined the list in 2010 while South Korea did so in 2011 as these countries' nominal GDPs once again were above $1 trillion. Accordingly, with the IMF, Mexico's estimated nominal GDP in 2009 also disminished below the trillion dollar mark, although other sources such as the CIA reported it above the mark.

[[Africa]] and [[Antarctica]] are the only continents without countries included in the group.

All of the [[G8]] and [[BRIC]] countries are currently $1 trillion economies in United States dollars. Since currency valuations can be subject to rapid change, a country could achieve the US$1 trillion nominal GDP mark one year and then produce less than that in total goods and services the following year(s). The 2010 data used here are compiled according to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) values. As for the former Soviet Union, the last statistics about its economy stated that it had an over US$2.5 trillion economy in the 1990 fiscal year, before its collapse. Also, the Soviet Union reached US$1 trillion in 1988.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7844">'''Toponymic Guidelines''' (full title: ''Toponymic guidelines for map and other editors, for international use'') are up-to-date documents promoted by the [[United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names]] (UNGEGN). The aim of these documents is to compile information on [[Toponymy|toponymic]] issues of a certain country, especially from the perspective of [[standardization]] of geographical names.

==Origin==
At the Third [[United Nations]] Conference on the Standardization of geographical Names held in August/September 1977 at [[Athens]] (Greece), gathering and dissemination of toponymic information was discussed. The great variation in approaches from country to country led [[Josef Breu]], who was elected Chair of the United Nations Group of Experts (UNGEGN) on that very Conference, to initiate the compilation of more or less standardized Toponymic Guidelines. As a sample for these guidelines he elaborated Toponymic Guidelines for International Cartography of his native Austria and presented them as Working Paper Nr. 5 at the Eighth Session of The UNGEGN, held in February/March 1979 at [[New York City|New York]]. This sample sticks to the table of contents which Breu had already outlined in 1977.

==UN resolutions promoting Toponymic Guidelines==
The echo on Breus proposal was very positive. In the years to come four [[United Nations Resolution|resolutions]] were adopted in favour of the promotion of Toponymic Guidelines. At the 4th UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names ([[Geneva]], August/September 1982) resolution nr. 4 was drafted,&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/docs/4th-uncsgn-docs/4-uncsgn-rpt-en.pdf Report of the Fourth United Nations Conference on The Standardization of Geographical Names, page 29]&lt;/ref&gt; concerning the Publication of Toponymic Guidelines for map and other editors: This resolution presents a checklist on the contents of Guidelines and recommends that the Toponymic Guidelines submitted by Austria should serve as a sample of format and contents. It also recommends that a correspondent should be appointed by the UNGEGN to coordinate the work of developing national Toponymic Guidelines and to maintain communication with national experts involved in their elaboration.

At the 5th United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names ([[Montreal]], August 1987) another two resolutions were passed that concern Toponymic Guidelines: Resolution nr. 11 recommends that a clear typographical distinction should be made on national maps between toponyms and text items for other purposes. The methods of differentiations should be explained in the national Toponymic Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/docs/5th-uncsgn-doc/5-uncsgn-rpt-en.pdf Report of the Fifth United Nations Conference on The Standardization of Geographical Names, page 37]&lt;/ref&gt;

Resolution nr. 14 of this Conference recommends that countries should be strongly encouraged to publish and keep up to date Toponymic Guidelines, and that the United Nations Secretariat should provide appropriate assistance for their publication and dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/docs/5th-uncsgn-doc/5-uncsgn-rpt-en.pdf Report of the Fifth United Nations Conference on The Standardization of Geographical Names, page 38]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 6th UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names (New York, August/September 1992) resolution nr. 14 recommends Toponymic Guidelines in combined volumes, in at least one of the working languages of the United Nations, and that provision should be made to issue the Guidelines in the World Cartography bulletin.

The title of the Toponymic Guidelines has been modified in 1982 and 1986. Whereas Breu in his sample used the title ''Toponymic Guidelines for International Cartography'', the above-mentioned resolution nr. 4 of the 4th UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names uses the title ''Toponymic guidelines for map and other editors''. In 1986, on the 12th Session of the UNGEGN, it was decided to add ''for international use'' to the title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/docs/12th-gegn-docs/12th_gegn_E.pdf Report of the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names on the Work of its Twelfth Session, page 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Resolution nr. 4, passed at the 4th UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names in 1982, presented a checklist of items, which Toponymic Guidelines should contain:

* Legal status of geographical names in the respective languages of multilingual countries;
* Alphabets of the language or languages and, furthermore, in the case of non-Roman alphabets and scripts, the officially introduced [[romanization]] keys;
* Spelling rules for geographical names;
* Aids to pronunciation of geographical names;
* Linguistic [[Substratum|substrata]] recognizable in the existing place names, but only as far as their knowledge could be of benefit to the [[cartographer]];
* Relationship between [[Dialect|dialect(s)]] and [[Standard language|standard language(s)]];
* Peculiarities of dialect and areal distribution of the main dialects;
* Areal distribution of languages in multilingual countries;
* Names authorities and measures taken in names standardization;
* Source material;
* Glossary of words necessary for the understanding of maps;
* Abbreviations in official maps;
* Administrative divisions.

==List of countries that have published Toponymic Guidelines==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1761">'''''US Census Bureau International Data Base''''' (IDB) is a global demographic product created by the [[United States Census Bureau]]. The U.S. Census Bureau has been preparing estimates and projections of the populations of foreign countries since the 1960s &lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/international-database.html U.S. Census International Data Base Website&lt;/ref&gt; for a number of reasons. In the 1980s, the Census Bureau released its first comprehensive set of estimates and projections for over 200 countries and areas of the world. Since then, the Census Bureau periodically updates estimates and projections for countries as new data become available, funding permits, and conditions warrant. IDB estimates and projections are produced for those countries and areas recognized by the U.S. Department of State which have populations of 5,000 or more. The statistics are maintained for every year from 1950 until the present plus have future projections until 2050. Population size (by single year of age and sex) and components of change (fertility, mortality, and migration) are provided for each calendar year beyond the initial or base year, through 2050.

The U.S. Census Bureau International Programs office has released a web map viewer that allows everyone to explore this data set, the International Map Viewer.

'''Val Demone''' or '''Val di Demona''' (English: 'Valley of Demona') is a historical and geographical region encompassing the north-eastern third of [[Sicily]]. Historically, it was one of the [[three valli of Sicily]].

Val Demone was the last part of the island to be [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|conquered]] by the Arabs in the 10th century. Christian refugees from other parts of Sicily congregated there, and the region remained in contact with the [[Byzantine]] provinces in [[southern Italy]]. It was the base for the Byzantine attempt to reconquer Sicily under [[George Maniakes]] in the early 11th century. Consequently it was the least Arabicized and Islamicized part of Sicily,&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe (2009), pp. 34–36, 40&lt;/ref&gt; and was still mostly Greek-speaking at the time of the Norman conquest in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Loud, G. A. |title=The Latin Church in Norman Italy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |page=494 |isbn=978-0-521-25551-6 |quote=At the end of the twelfth century&amp;nbsp;... While in Apulia Greeks were in a majority – and indeed present in any numbers at all – only in the Salento peninsula in the extreme south, at the time of the conquest they had an overwhelming preponderance in Lucaina and central and southern Calabria, as well as comprising anything up to a third of the population of Sicily, concentrated especially in the north-east of the island, the Val Demone.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10392">'''Volunteered geographic information''' ('''VGI'''){{dubious|date=November 2018}} is the harnessing of tools to create, assemble, and disseminate geographic data provided voluntarily by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10708-007-9111-y | last1 = Goodchild | first1 = M.F. | year = 2007 | title = Citizens as sensors: the world of volunteered geography | url = | journal = GeoJournal | volume = 69 | issue = 4| pages = 211–221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sangiambut |first1=Suthee |last2=Sieber |first2=Renee |title=The V in VGI: Citizens or Civic Data Sources |journal=Urban Planning |volume=1 |issue=2 |doi=10.17645/up.v1i2.644 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/644}}&lt;/ref&gt; VGI is a special case of the larger Web phenomenon known as [[user-generated content]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10708-007-9111-y | last1 = Goodchild | first1 = M.F. | year = 2007 | title = Citizens as sensors: the world of volunteered geography | url = | journal = GeoJournal | volume = 69 | issue = 4| pages = 211–221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows citizens to have a more active role in [[urban planning]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steiniger |first1=Stefan |last2=Poorazizi |first2=M. Ebrahim |last3=Hunter |first3=Andrew |title=Planning with Citizens: Implementation of an e-Planning Platform and Analysis of Research Needs |journal=Urban Planning |volume=1 |issue=2 |doi=10.17645/up.v1i2.607 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/607}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some examples of this phenomenon are [[WikiMapia]], [[OpenStreetMap]], and [[Yandex.Map editor]]. VGI can also be seen as an extension of critical and participatory approaches to [[geographic information systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10708-008-9186-0 | last1 = Elwood | first1 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Volunteered Geographic Information: Future Research Directions Motivated by Critical, Participatory, and Feminist GIS | url = | journal = GeoJournal | volume = 72 | issue = 3&amp;4 | pages = 173–183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
VGI attracted concerns about [[data quality]], and specifically about its [[credibility]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10708-008-9188-y | last1 = Flanagin | first1 = A. J. | last2 = Metzger | first2 = M. J. | year = 2008 | title = The credibility of volunteered geographic information | url = | journal = GeoJournal | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 137–148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the possibility of [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ballatore |first1=A. |title=Defacing the map: Cartographic vandalism in the digital commons |journal=The Cartographic Journal |year=2014 | volume=51 | number=3 | pages= 214–224|arxiv=1404.3341| doi = 10.1179/1743277414Y.0000000085}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These sites provide general base map information and allow users to create their own content by marking locations where various events occurred or certain features exist, but aren’t already shown on the base map. Some examples include 311-style request systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lu |first1=Qing |last2=Johnson |first2=Peter |title=Characterizing New Channels of Communication: A Case Study of Municipal 311 Requests in Edmonton, Canada |journal=Urban Planning |volume=1 |issue=2 |doi=10.17645/up.v1i2.621 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/621}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3D spatial technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sabri |first1=Soheil |last2=Rajabifard |first2=Abbas |last3=Ho |first3=Serene |last4=Amirebrahimi |first4=Sam |last5=Bishop |first5=Ian |title=Leveraging VGI Integrated with 3D Spatial Technology to Support Urban Intensification in Melbourne, Australia |journal=Urban Planning |volume=1 |issue=2 |doi=10.17645/up.v1i2.623 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important elements of VGI in contrast to standard UGC is the geographic element, and its relationship with [[collaborative mapping]]. The information volunteered by the individual is linked to a specific geographic region. While this is often taken to relate to elements of traditional cartography, VGI offers the possibility of including subjective, emotional, or other non-cartographic information.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, C.J., 2014. The Fundamentals of Human Factors Design for Volunteered Geographic Information, London, UK: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Geo-referenced data produced within services such as [[Trip Advisor]], [[Flickr]], [[Twitter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Resch |first1=Bernd |last2=Summa |first2=Anja |last3=Zeile |first3=Peter |last4=Strube |first4=Michael |title=Citizen-Centric Urban Planning through Extracting Emotion Information from Twitter in an Interdisciplinary Space-Time-Linguistics Algorithm |journal=Urban Planning |volume=1 |issue=2 |doi=10.17645/up.v1i2.617 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/617}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Instagram]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guerrero |first1=Paulina |last2=Møller |first2=Maja |last3=Olafsson |first3=Anton |last4=Snizek |first4=Bernhard |title=Revealing Cultural Ecosystem Services through Instagram Images: The Potential of Social Media Volunteered Geographic Information for Urban Green Infrastructure Planning and Governance |journal=Urban Planning |volume=1 |issue=2 |doi=10.17645/up.v1i2.609 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/609}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Panoramio]] can be considered as VGI.

==Criticism of the term==

The term VGI has been criticized for poorly representing common variations in the data of [[OpenStreetMap]] and other sites: that some of the data is paid, in the case of CloudMade's ambassadors, or generated by another entity, as in US Census data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorman|first=Sean|title=Why VGI is the Wrong Acronym|url=http://blog.geoiq.com/2010/04/15/why-vgi-is-the-wrong-acronym/|publisher=Fortius One|accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because it is gathered by individuals with no formal training, the quality and reliability of VGI is a topic of much debate.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, A., 2007. The Cult of the Amateur, London, UK: Nicholas Brealey.&lt;/ref&gt; Some methods of quality assurance have been tested, namely, the use of control data to verify VGI accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Comber | first1 = A. | last2 = See | first2 = L. | last3 = Fritz | first3 = S. | last4 = Van der Velde | first4 = M. | last5 = Perger | first5 = C. | last6 = Foody | first6 = G. | year = 2013 | title = Using Control Data to Determine the Reliability of Volunteered Geographic Information about Land Cover | url = | journal = International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 37–48 | doi = 10.1016/j.jag.2012.11.002 | bibcode = 2013IJAEO..23...37C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on users==

While there is concern over the authority of the data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Brien |first1=Jamie |last2=Serra |first2=Miguel |last3=Hudson-Smith |first3=Andrew |last4=Psarra |first4=Sophia |last5=Hunter |first5=Anthony |last6=Zaltz-Austwick |first6=Martin |title=Ensuring VGI Credibility in Urban-Community Data Generation: A Methodological Research Design |journal=Urban Planning |volume=1 |issue=2 |doi=10.17645/up.v1i2.620 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/620}}&lt;/ref&gt; VGI may provide benefits beyond that of PGI (Professional Geographic Information),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Christopher J.|date=2014|title=The Fundamentals of Human Factors Design for Volunteered Geographic Information|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-03503-1|journal=SpringerBriefs in Geography|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-03503-1|issn=2211-4165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = M. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = Usability of Geographic Information; Current Challenges and Future Directions | url = | journal = Applied Ergonomics | volume = 44 | issue = 6| pages = 855–865 | doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2012.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; partly due to its ability to collect and present data not collected or curated by traditional/professional sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = C.J. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = Capturing Volunteered Information For Inclusive Service Design: Potential Benefits And Challenges | url = | journal = The Design Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 197–218 | doi=10.2752/175630613x13584367984947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = C.J. | last2 = May | first2 = A.J. | last3 = Mitchell | first3 = V. | year = 2012 | title = The Role Of VGI And PGI In Supporting Outdoor Activities | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687012000816 | journal = Applied Ergonomics | volume = 44 | issue = 6| pages = 886–894 | doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2012.04.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = May | first1 = A. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2014 | title = Evaluating a concept design of a crowd-sourced "mashup" providing ease-of-access information for people with limited mobility | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X1400299X | journal = Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies | volume = 49 | issue = 1| pages = 103–113 | doi=10.1016/j.trc.2014.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, VGI provides positive emotional value to users in functionality, satisfaction, social connection and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, C.J., May, A.J. &amp; Mitchell, V., 2010.

'''West Bengal Survey Institute''', or '''WBSI''', is a [[public]] [[Vocational education|technical]] [[education]] college located in [[Bandel]], [[West Bengal]]. It is affiliated with [[West Bengal State Council of Technical Education]] (WBSCTE) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Affiliated Polytechnic with the West Bengal State Council of Technical Education | url=http://wbscte.net/info/list-of-politichnic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and approved by [[All India Council For Technical Education]] (AICTE). It provides Diploma level technical education to its students in [[Surveying]], [[Civil Engineering]] and GIS-GPS Engineering. It is counted amongst the most reputed and renowned technical engineering education in the state of West Bengal. WBSI was established in 1947 with the intention of providing professional, technical and engineering education.

==History==
In the year 1914 a survey school was established at Maynamati (Comilla)now in Bangladesh and after independent major number of teaching &amp; non-teaching staffs along some materials of noted institute left Maynamati to find its address at Bandel. For the time being it was shifted elsewhere; but soon it was rehabilitated at Bandel bearing name West Bengal Survey Institute (WBSI). Prior to 1991, WBSI was under the administration of West Bengal Government's "Land &amp; Land Revenue Departments", and was awarding a 2-year trade certificate on Land Surveying. Binoy Choudhury, then land &amp; land reform minister once visited the area and then he was interested to think for better utilisation of institute's land. Professor Narayan Ch Ghosh, closed to Choudhury, convinced him for its transformation to a higher level survey course training institute.  Binoy Choudhury took initiative and in the year 1988, the first ever Diploma in Survey Engineering was introduced and other courses were discontinued. Dr. Pradip K. Roy, then associate professor of Civil &amp; Structural Engineering, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur was instrumental behind course formation. Later Professor Narayan Ch Ghosh was AICTE nominee in the Governing Body of West Bengal Survey Institute. Dr. N. C. Ghosh was proposer &amp; Director of 1st National Seminar organised by West Bengal Survey Institute. Noted seminar was sponsored by funding agencies of Central Government of India &amp; W.B. State Government. He took initiative for up-gradation of West Bengal Survey Institute to a degree level institute. He moved it to the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), met officials at Delhi and institute got 'letter of intent' from AICTE for Starting a degree level Survey Institute in the vast land of West Bengal Survey Institute introducing the B.Tech courses in i. Survey Engineering and ii. Town &amp; Country Panning Engineering. Later though Diploma in Civil Engineering were introduced, starting of B.Tech courses did not materialized.
