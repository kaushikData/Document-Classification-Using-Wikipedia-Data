'''110''' (''one hundred [and] ten'') is the [[natural number]] following [[109 (number)|109]] and preceding [[111 (number)|111]].

==In mathematics==
110 is a [[sphenic number]] and a [[pronic number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002378|title=Sloane's A002378 : Oblong (or promic, pronic, or heteromecic) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[prime quadruplet]] (101, 103, 107, 109), at 110, the [[Mertens function]] reaches a low of −5.

110 is the sum of three consecutive [[Square (algebra)|square]]s, &lt;math&gt;110 = 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2&lt;/math&gt;.

110 is the side of the smallest square that can be tiled with distinct integer-sided squares.

[[RSA-110]] is one of the [[RSA numbers]], large semiprimes that are part of the [[RSA Factoring Challenge]].

The [[Rule 110 cellular automaton]], like [[Conway's Game of Life]], exhibits what [[Stephen Wolfram]] calls "[[Cellular_automaton#Wolfram_classes|Class 4]] behavior," which is neither completely random nor completely repetitive.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Wolfram, ''A New Kind of Science'' p229.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3615">In [[probability theory]], '''Bennett's [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]''' provides an [[upper bound]] on the [[probability]] that the sum of [[independent random variables]] deviates from its [[expected value]] by more than any specified amount. Bennett's inequality was proved by George Bennett of the [[University of New South Wales]] in 1962.&lt;ref name=bennett&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = G. | title = Probability Inequalities for the Sum of Independent Random Variables | journal = [[Journal of the American Statistical Association]] | volume = 57 | issue = 297 | pages = 33–45 | doi = 10.2307/2282438 | jstor = 2282438| year = 1962 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statement ==
Let 
{{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, … ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}
be [[independent random variables]] with finite variance and assume (for simplicity but [[without loss of generality]]) they all have zero expected value.

Then for any {{math|''t'' ≥ 0}},

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr\left( S_n &gt; t \right) \leq
\exp\left( - \frac{\sigma^2}{a^2} h\left(\frac{at}{\sigma^2} \right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

For generalizations see Freedman (1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On tail probabilities for martingales.| first1=D. A. |last1=Freedman| authorlink1=David A. Freedman |  publisher=[[The Annals of Probability]]|volume= 3| year=1975| pages=100–118| url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2959268?uid=3738016&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104036220407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fan, Grama and Liu (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hoeffding's inequality for supermartingales| first1=X. |last1=Fan|  first2=I. |last2=Grama |first3=Q. |last3=Liu| journal=[[Stochastic Processes and their Applications]]|volume= 122| year=2012| pages=3545–3559| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304414912001378 | doi=10.1016/j.spa.2012.06.009|arxiv=1109.4359}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] version of Bennett's inequality and its improvement, respectively.

[[Hoeffding's inequality]] only assumes the summands are bounded almost surely, while Bennett's inequality offers some improvement when the variances of the summands are small compared to their almost sure bounds. However Hoeffding's inequality entails sub-Gaussian tails, whereas in general Bennett's inequality has Poissonian tails.{{cn|date=September 2016}}
In both inequalities, unlike some other inequalities or limit theorems, there is no requirement that the component variables have identical or similar distributions.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5699">In [[combinatorics]], '''bijective proof''' is a [[mathematical proof|proof]] technique that finds a [[bijective function]] ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' between two [[finite set]]s ''A'' and ''B'', or a size-preserving bijective function between two [[combinatorial class]]es, thus proving that they have the same number of elements, |''A''| = |''B''|.  One place the technique is useful is where we wish to know the size of ''A'', but can find no direct way of counting its elements.  Then establishing a bijection from ''A'' to some ''B'' solves the problem in the case when ''B'' is more easily countable.  Another useful feature of the technique is that the nature of the bijection itself often provides powerful insights into each or both of the sets.

==Basic examples==

=== Proving the symmetry of the binomial coefficients ===

The symmetry of the binomial coefficients states that

:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k}. &lt;/math&gt;

This means there are exactly as many [[permutations and combinations|combinations]] of ''k'' in a set of ''n'' as there are combinations of ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' in a set of&amp;nbsp;''n''.

==== The bijective proof ====

The key idea of the proof may be understood from a simple example: selecting out of a group of ''n'' children which ''k'' to reward with ice cream cones has exactly the same effect as choosing instead the ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' children to be denied them. More abstractly and generally, we note that the two quantities asserted to be equal count the subsets of size ''k'' and ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'', respectively, of any ''n''-element set ''S''.  There is a simple bijection between the two families ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of subsets of ''S'': it associates every ''k''-element subset with its [[complement (set theory)|complement]], which contains precisely the remaining ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' elements of ''S''.  Since ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; have the same number of elements, the corresponding binomial coefficients must be equal.

=== Pascal's triangle recurrence relation ===
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}\text{ for }1 \le k \le n - 1. &lt;/math&gt;

==== The bijective proof ====

''Proof''.
We count the number of ways to choose ''k'' elements from an ''n''-set.
Again, by definition, the left hand side of the equation is the number of ways to choose ''k'' from ''n''.
Since 1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n'' &amp;minus; 1, we can pick a fixed element ''e'' from the ''n''-set so that the remaining subset is not empty.
For each ''k''-set, if ''e'' is chosen, there are

: &lt;math&gt;{n-1 \choose k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

ways to choose the remaining ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 elements among the remaining ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 choices; otherwise, there are 

: &lt;math&gt;{n-1 \choose k}&lt;/math&gt;

ways to choose the remaining ''k'' elements among the remaining ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 choices. Thus, there are 

:&lt;math&gt;{n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}&lt;/math&gt;

ways to choose ''k'' elements depending on whether ''e'' is included in each selection, as in the right hand side expression. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

Problems that admit combinatorial proofs are not limited to binomial coefficient identities. As the complexity of the problem increases, a combinatorial proof can become very sophisticated. This technique is particularly useful in areas of [[discrete mathematics]] such as [[combinatorics]], [[graph theory]], and [[number theory]].

The most classical examples of bijective proofs in combinatorics include:
* [[Prüfer sequence]], giving a proof of [[Cayley's formula]] for the number of [[labeled tree]]s.
* [[Robinson-Schensted algorithm]], giving a proof of [[William Burnside|Burnside]]'s formula for the [[symmetric group]].
* [[Partition (number theory)#Ferrers graph|Conjugation]] of [[Young diagram]]s, giving a proof of a classical result on the number of certain [[Partition (number theory)|integer partitions]].
* Bijective proofs of the [[pentagonal number theorem]].
* Bijective proofs of the formula for the [[Catalan number]]s.

'''Chaim Goodman-Strauss''' (born June 22,1967 in Austin TX) is an American mathematician who works in [[convex geometry]], especially [[aperiodic tiling]]. He is on the faculty of the [[University of Arkansas]] and is a co-author with [[John H. Conway]] of ''The Symmetries of Things'', a comprehensive book surveying the mathematical theory of patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plus.maths.org/content/symmetries-things Review of ''The symmetries of things''], by Phil Wilson, [[Plus Magazine]], December 1, 2008:  "The book presents a whole new way of looking at patterns. The methods have been worked out so exhaustively, and the trails opened up in the book have been followed so extensively, that you almost can't believe that such a huge body of knowledge could have lain dormant for so long!"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Goodman-Strauss received both his B.S. (1988) and Ph.D. (1994) in mathematics from the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref name=collegeboard&gt;[https://www.collegeboard.org/node/12446 Chaim Goodman-Strauss] The College Board&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral advisor was [[John Edwin Luecke]].&lt;ref name="nodak"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=13187|title=Chaim Goodman-Strauss - The Mathematics Genealogy Project|website=genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu|accessdate=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the faculty at the [[University of Arkansas, Fayetteville]] (UA) in 1994 and served as departmental chair from 2008 to 2015. He held visiting positions at the  [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] and at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name=collegeboard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebrationofmind.org/?project=chaim-goodman-strauss Gathering for Gardner] Celebration of Mind Presenter&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1995 he did research at [[The Geometry Center]], a mathematics research and education center at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he investigated aperiodic tilings of the plane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/about/people/home/strauss.html Chaim Goodman-Strauss: Activities at the Geometry Center] University Of Minnesota&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodman-Strauss has been fascinated by patterns and mathematical paradoxes for as long as he can remember. He attended a lecture about the mathematician [[Georg Cantor]] when he was 17 and says, "I was already doomed to be a mathematician, but that lecture sealed my fate."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://researchfrontiers.uark.edu/the-shape-of-everyday-things/ The Shape of Everyday Things]'' by Melissa Lutz Blouin. Research News, Spring 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He became a mathematics writer and popularizer. From 2004 to 2012, in conjunction with [[KUAF|KUAF 91.3 FM]], the University of Arkansas [[NPR]] affiliate, he presented ”The Math Factor", a podcast website dealing with recreational mathematics.&lt;ref name=factor&gt;[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/about/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] July 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He is an admirer of [[Martin Gardner]] and is on the Math &amp; Science Advisory Council of [[Gathering 4 Gardner]], an organization that celebrates the legacy of the famed mathematics popularizer and [[Scientific American]] columnist,&lt;ref name=g4g&gt;[http://www.gathering4gardner.org/about/ About The G4G Foundation] Gathering 4 Gardner&lt;/ref&gt; and is particularly active in the associated [[Celebration of Mind]] events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebrationofmind.org/project/chaim-goodman-strauss Presenter: Chaim Goodman-Strauss] Celebration of Mind&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebrationofmind.org/archives/1357 Doubly Marked Robinson Tiles] Celebration of Mind&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical artist==
In 2008 Goodman-Strauss teamed up with [[J. H. Conway]] and [[Heidi Burgiel]] to write ''The Symmetries of Things'', an exhaustive and reader accessible overview of the mathematical theory of patterns. He produced hundreds of full-color images for this book using software that he developed for the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathimagery/thumbnails.php?album=17 Chaim Goodman-Strauss :: Symmetries] AMS:  Mathematical Imagery&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mathematical Association of America said, "The first thing one notices when one picks up a copy … is that it is a beautiful book … filled with gorgeous color pictures … many of which were generated by Goodman-Strauss. Unlike some books which add in illustrations to keep the reader's attention, the pictures are genuinely essential to the topic of this book."&lt;ref name=glass&gt;[https://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/the-symmetries-of-things Review of ''The symmetries of things''], by Darren Glass, [[The Mathematical Association of America]], July 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He also creates large-scale sculptures inspired by mathematics, and some of these have been featured at Gathering 4 Gardner conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] Pictures from the Gathering&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''Clélie''' or '''Clelia curve''' is a curve parameterized by&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Modern Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces with Mathematica|first=Mary|last=Gray|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1997|isbn=9780849371646|page=928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LRumtTimYgC&amp;pg=PA928}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;x=a \sin(m\theta) \cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y=a \sin(m\theta) \sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;z=a \cos(m\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

A curve of this type is confined to the surface of a [[sphere]] of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Universal Book of Mathematics: From Abracadabra to Zeno's Paradoxes|first=David|last=Darling|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Son|year=2004|isbn=9780471667001|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrOxRdtYYaMC&amp;pg=PA70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as is obvious from the parametric equations for the surface of a sphere. When &lt;math&gt;m=1&lt;/math&gt;, this is [[Viviani's curve]].

The curve was named by [[Luigi Guido Grandi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Aperçu historique sur l'origine et le développement des méthodes en géométrie: particulièrement de celles qui se rapportent à la géométrie moderne, suivi d'un Mémoire de géométrie sur deux principes généraux de la science, la dualité et l'homographie|first=Michel|last=Chasles|language=French|authorlink=Michel Chasles|publisher=M.

A '''coherent algebra''' is an [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] of complex square matrices that is closed under [[Matrix multiplication|ordinary matrix multiplication]], [[Hadamard product (matrices)|Schur product]], [[Matrix transpose|transposition]], and contains both the [[identity matrix]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and the all-ones matrix &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~cgodsil/pdfs/assoc2.pdf|title=Association Schemes|last=Godsil|first=Chris|date=2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
A subspace &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Mat}_{n \times n}(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a coherent algebra of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; if:
* &lt;math&gt;I, J \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;M^{T} \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;M \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;MN \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M \circ N \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;M, N \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.
A coherent algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; is said to be:
* ''Homogeneous'' if every matrix in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; has a constant diagonal.
* ''Commutative'' if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; is commutative with respect to ordinary matrix multiplication.
* ''Symmetric'' if every matrix in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; is symmetric.
The set &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; of ''Schur-primitive matrices'' in a coherent algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(\mathcal{A}) := \{ M \in \mathcal{A} : M \circ M = M, M \circ N \in \operatorname{span} \{ M \} \text{ for all } N \in \mathcal{A} \} &lt;/math&gt;.

Dually, the set &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; of ''primitive matrices'' in a coherent algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\mathcal{A}) := \{ M \in \mathcal{A} : M^{2} = M, MN \in \operatorname{span} \{ M \} \text{ for all } N \in \mathcal{A} \} &lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
* The [[Centralizer and normalizer|centralizer]] of a group of permutation matrices is a coherent algebra, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; is a coherent algebra of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W} := \{ M \in \mathrm{Mat}_{n \times n}(\mathbb{C}) : MP = PM \text { for all } P \in S \}&lt;/math&gt; for a group &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; permutation matrices.  Additionally, the centralizer of the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of permutation matrices representing the [[Graph automorphism|automorphism group]] of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is homogeneous if and only if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is [[vertex-transitive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Godsil|first=Chris|date=2011-01-26|title=Periodic Graphs|url=http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v18i1p23|journal=The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics|volume=18|issue=1|pages=P23|issn=1077-8926}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The span of the set of matrices relating pairs of elements lying in the same orbit of a diagonal action of a finite group on a finite set is a coherent algebra,   i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W} := \operatorname{span} \{ A(u,v) : u,v \in V \}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A(u,v) \in \operatorname{Mat}_{V \times V}(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;(A(u,v))_{x, y} := \begin{cases} 1 \ \text{if } (x, y) = (u^{g}, v^{g}) \text { for some } g \in G \\ 0 \text{ otherwise } \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;for all &lt;math&gt;u, v \in V&lt;/math&gt; of a finite set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; acted on by a finite group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.
* The span of a [[regular representation]] of a finite group as a group of permutation matrices over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a coherent algebra.

== Properties ==
* The [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of a set of coherent algebras of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a coherent algebra.
* The [[Kronecker product|tensor product]] of coherent algebras is a coherent algebra, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \otimes \mathcal{B} := \{ M \otimes N : M \in \mathcal{A} \text{ and } N \in \mathcal{B} \}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in \operatorname{Mat}_{m \times m}(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B} \in \mathrm{Mat}_{n \times n}(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; are coherent algebras.
* The ''symmetrization'' &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathcal{A}} := \operatorname{span} \{ M + M^{T} : M \in \mathcal{A} \}&lt;/math&gt; of a commutative coherent algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a coherent algebra.
* If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a coherent algebra, then &lt;math&gt;M^{T} \in \Gamma(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;M \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = \operatorname{span} \left ( \Gamma(\mathcal{A} \right ))&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I \in \Gamma(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is homogeneous.
* Dually, if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative coherent algebra (of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;E^{T}, E^{*} \in \Lambda(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;E \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n} J \in \Lambda(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = \operatorname{span} \left ( \Lambda(\mathcal{A} \right ))&lt;/math&gt; as well.
* Every symmetric coherent algebra is commutative, and every commutative coherent algebra is homogeneous.
* A coherent algebra is commutative if and only if it is the [[Bose–Mesner algebra]] of a (commutative) [[association scheme]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* A coherent algebra forms a [[principal ideal ring]] under Schur product; moreover, a commutative coherent algebra forms a principal ideal ring under ordinary matrix multiplication as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">In [[dynamical systems theory]], '''Conley index theory''', named after [[Charles C. Conley|Charles Conley]], analyzes topological structure of invariant sets of [[diffeomorphism]]s and of smooth [[flow (mathematics)|flows]]. It is a far-reaching generalization of the [[Hopf index theorem]] that predicts existence of fixed points of a flow inside a planar region in terms of information about its behavior on the boundary. Conley's theory is related to [[Morse theory]], which describes the topological structure of a closed [[manifold]] by means of a nondegenerate [[gradient vector field]]. It has an enormous range of applications to the study of dynamics, including existence of [[periodic orbit]]s in [[Hamiltonian system]]s and [[travelling wave]] solutions for [[partial differential equation]]s, structure of global [[attractor]]s for [[reaction-diffusion equation]]s and [[delay differential equation]]s, proof of [[chaotic behavior]] in dynamical systems, and [[bifurcation theory]]. Conley index theory formed the basis for development of [[Floer homology]].

== Short description ==
A key role in the theory is played by the notions of [[isolating neighborhood]] ''N'' and isolated invariant set ''S''. The '''Conley index''' ''h''(''S'') is the [[homotopy type]] of a certain pair (''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of compact subsets of ''N'', called an '''index pair'''. Charles Conley showed that index pairs exist and that the index of ''S'' is independent of the choice of an isolated neighborhood ''N'' and the index pair. In the special case of the negative gradient flow to a smooth function, the Conley index of a nondegenerate (Morse) critical point of index ''k'' is the pointed homotopy type of the [[n-sphere|''k''-sphere]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.

A deep theorem due to Conley asserts '''continuation invariance''': Conley index is invariant under certain deformations of the dynamical system. Computation of the index can, therefore, be reduced to the case of the diffeomorphism or a vector field whose invariant sets are well understood. 

If the index is nontrivial then the invariant set ''S'' is nonempty. This principle can be amplified to establish existence of fixed points and periodic orbits inside ''N''.

'''David Bernard Shmoys''' (born 1959) is a Professor in the [[Cornell University College of Engineering|School of Operations Research and Information Engineering]] and the [[Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences|Department of Computer Science]] at [[Cornell University]]. He obtained his Ph.D. from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1984. His major focus has been in the design and [[analysis of algorithms]] for discrete optimization problems.

In particular, his work has highlighted the role of [[linear programming]] in the design of [[approximation algorithms]] for [[NP-hard]] problems. He is known for his pioneering research on providing first constant factor performance guarantee for several scheduling and clustering problems including the k-center and k-median problems and the generalized assignment problem. [[Polynomial-time approximation scheme]]s that he developed for [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] problems have found applications in many subsequent works. His current research includes stochastic [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], computational sustainability and optimization techniques in computational biology. Shmoys is married to [[Éva Tardos]], who is the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University.

==Key contributions==
Two of his key contributions are

# Constant factor approximation algorithm for the [[Generalized Assignment Problem]] and [[Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling]].

# Constant factor approximation algorithm for [[k-Medians]] and [[Facility location problem]].

These contributions are described briefly below:

===Generalized Assignment Problem &amp; Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling===

The paper&lt;ref name=MATHPROG93&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01585178| title = An approximation algorithm for the generalized assignment problem| journal = Mathematical Programming| volume = 62| pages = 461| year = 1993| last1 = Shmoys | first1 = D. B. | authorlink1 = David Shmoys| last2 = Tardos | first2 = É. }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a joint work by David Shmoys and Eva Tardos.

The generalized assignment problem can be viewed as the following problem of scheduling unrelated parallel machine with costs.
Each of  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; independent jobs (denoted &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt;) have to be processed by exactly one of &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; unrelated parallel machines (denoted &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;). Unrelated implies same job might take different amount of processing time on different machines. Job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; takes &lt;math&gt; p_{i,j} &lt;/math&gt; time units when processed by machine &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; and incurs a cost &lt;math&gt; c_{i,j} , i=1,2,..,m; j=1,2,..,n; n \geq m&lt;/math&gt;. Given &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; T_i , i=1,2,..,m &lt;/math&gt;, we wish to decide if there exists a schedule with total cost at most &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt;  such that for each machine &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; its load, the total processing time required for the jobs assigned to it is at most &lt;math&gt; T_i , i=1,2,..,m &lt;/math&gt;. By scaling the processing times, we can assume, without loss of generality, that the machine load bounds satisfy &lt;math&gt; T_1=T_2=..=T_m=T&lt;/math&gt;. ``In other words, generalized assignment problem is to find a schedule of minimum cost subject to the constraint that the makespan, that the maximum machine load is at most &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; ".

The work of Shmoys with [[Jan Karel Lenstra|Lenstra]] and Tardos  cited here&lt;ref name=MATHPROG193&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01585745| title = Approximation algorithms for scheduling unrelated parallel machines| journal = Mathematical Programming| volume = 46| pages = 259| year = 1990| last1 = Lenstra | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Shmoys | first2 = D. B. | authorlink2 = David Shmoys| last3 = Tardos | first3 = É. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
gives a 2 approximation algorithm for the unit cost case. The algorithm is based on a clever design of linear program using [[parametric pruning]] and then rounding an [[extreme point solution]] of the linear program deterministically. Algorithm for the
generalized assignment problem is based on a similar LP through parametric pruning and then using a new rounding technique on a carefully designed bipartite graph. We now state the LP formulation and briefly describe the rounding technique.

We guess the optimum value of makespan &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; and write the following LP. This technique is known as parametric pruning.

&lt;math&gt;LP(T)::\sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^n c_{ij} x_{ij} \le C &lt;/math&gt;;
::&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^m x_{ij} = 1 \qquad j=1, \ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;;
::&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^m p_{ij}x_{ij} \leq T \qquad i=1, \ldots, m&lt;/math&gt;;
::&lt;math&gt; x_{ij} \geq 0 \qquad i=1, \ldots, m, \quad j=1, \ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;;
::&lt;math&gt; x_{ij}=0 \qquad \text{if} \qquad p_{ij} \geq T, \qquad i=1, \ldots, m, \quad j=1, \ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;;

The obtained LP solution is then rounded to an integral solution as follows. A weighted bipartite graph 
&lt;math&gt; G=(W \cup V, E)&lt;/math&gt; is constructed. One side of the bipartite graph contains the job nodes, &lt;math&gt; W =\{w_j | j \in J\}&lt;/math&gt;, and the other side contains several copies of each machine node, 
&lt;math&gt; V=\{v_{i,s} | i=1,2,..,m; s=1,2,..,k_i \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; k_i=\lceil \sum_{j} x_{ij} \rceil&lt;/math&gt;. To construct the edges to machine nodes corresponding to say machine &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, first jobs are arranged in decreasing order of processing time &lt;math&gt; p_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;. For simplicity, suppose, &lt;math&gt; p_{i1} \geq p_{i2} \geq \ldots \geq p_{in}&lt;/math&gt;. Now find the minimum index &lt;math&gt; j_1 &lt;/math&gt;, such that 
&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i}^{j_1} x_{ij} \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Include in &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; all the edges &lt;math&gt; (w_j,v_{i1}, j=1,2,..,j_1-1) &lt;/math&gt; with nonzero &lt;math&gt; x_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; and set their weights to &lt;math&gt;x'_{v_{i1}j}= x_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;. Create the edge &lt;math&gt; (w_{j_1}, v_{i1}) &lt;/math&gt;  and set its weight to &lt;math&gt; x'_{v_{i1}j_1}=1-\sum_{i=1}^{j_1-1} x'_{v_{i1}j} &lt;/math&gt;. This ensures that the total weight of the edges incident on the vertex &lt;math&gt; v_{i1} &lt;/math&gt; is at most 1. If &lt;math&gt;x'_{v_{i1}j_1} &lt; x_{ij_1}&lt;/math&gt;, then create an edge &lt;math&gt;(w_{j_1}, v_{i2})&lt;/math&gt; with weight &lt;math&gt; x'_{v_{i2}j_1}=x_{ij}-x'_{v_{i1}j_1} &lt;/math&gt;. Continue with assigning edges to &lt;math&gt; v_{i2} &lt;/math&gt; in a similar way. 

In the bipartite graph thus created, each job node in &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt; has a total edge weight of 1 incident on it, and each machine node in &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; has edges with total weight at most 1 incident on it. Thus the vector &lt;math&gt; x' &lt;/math&gt; is an instance of a fractional matching on &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; and thus it can be rounded to obtain an integral matching of same cost. 

Now considering the ordering of processing times of the jobs on the machines nodes during construction of &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; and using an easy charging argument, the following theorem can be proved:

'''Theorem:''' If &lt;math&gt;LP(T)&lt;/math&gt; has a feasible solution then a schedule can be constructed with makespan  
&lt;math&gt; T + max_{i,j}   p_{i,j} &lt;/math&gt; and cost &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt; max_{i,j} p_{i,j} \leq T &lt;/math&gt;, a 2 approximation is obtained.

===K-medians and Facility Location Problem===

The paper&lt;ref name=JCSS02&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1006/jcss.2002.1882| title = A Constant-Factor Approximation Algorithm for the k-Median Problem| journal = Journal of Computer and System Sciences| volume = 65| pages = 129| year = 2002| last1 = Charikar | first1 = M. | last2 = Guha | first2 = S. | last3 = Tardos | first3 = É. | last4 = Shmoys | first4 = D. B. | authorlink4 = David Shmoys}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a joint work by [[Moses Charikar]], [[Sudipto Guha]], [[Éva Tardos]] and David Shmoys. They obtain a &lt;math&gt; 6 \frac{2}{3} &lt;/math&gt; approximation to the metric [[k medians]] problem. This was the first paper to break the previously best known &lt;math&gt; O(\log{k}\ \log{\log{k}})&lt;/math&gt; approximation.

Shmoys has also worked extensively on the  [[facility location]] problem. His recent results include obtaining a &lt;math&gt; 3 &lt;/math&gt; approximation algorithm for the capacitated facility location problem. The joint work with [[Fabian Chudak]],&lt;ref name=S99&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10107-004-0524-9| title = Improved approximation algorithms for capacitated facility location problems| journal = Mathematical Programming| volume = 102| issue = 2| pages = 207| year = 2004| last1 = Chudak | first1 = F. N. A. | last2 = Williamson | first2 = D. P.  | author2-link = David P. Williamson}}&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in improving the previous known &lt;math&gt; 5.69 &lt;/math&gt; approximation for the same problem. Their algorithm is based on a variant of [[randomized rounding]] called the randomized rounding with a backup, since a backup solution is incorporated to correct for the fact that the ordinary randomized rounding rarely generates a feasible solution to the associated [[set cover]]ing problem. 

For the uncapacitated version of the facility location problem, again in a joint work with Chudak&lt;ref name=S03&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1137/S0097539703405754| title = Improved Approximation Algorithms for the Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem| journal = SIAM Journal on Computing| volume = 33| pages = 1| year = 2003| last1 = Chudak | first1 = F. N. A. | last2 = Shmoys | first2 = D. B. | authorlink2 = David Shmoys}}&lt;/ref&gt; he obtained a &lt;math&gt; (1+2/e) \approx 1.736 &lt;/math&gt;-approximation algorithm which was a significant improvement on the previously known approximation guarantees.
The improved algorithm works by rounding an optimal fractional solution of a linear programming relaxation and using the properties of the optimal solutions of the linear program and a generalization of a decomposition technique.

[[File:Edwin Hewitt.jpg|thumb|220px|Edwin Hewitt]]
'''Edwin Hewitt''' (January 20, 1920, [[Everett, Washington]] – June 21, 1999) was an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] known for his work in abstract [[harmonic analysis]] and for his discovery, in collaboration with [[Leonard Jimmie Savage]], of the [[Hewitt–Savage zero–one law]].

He received his Ph.D. in 1942 from  [[Harvard University]], and served on the faculty of mathematics at the [[University of Washington]] from 1954.

Hewitt pioneered the construction of the [[hyperreal number|hyperreals]] by means of an ultrapower construction (Hewitt, 1948).

Hewitt wrote the 1975 English translation of [[Alexandre Kirillov|A. A. Kirillov's]] 1972 Russian [[monograph]] ''Elements of the Theory of Representations'' (Элементы Теории Представлений), and co-authored "Abstract Harmonic Analysis" with [[Kenneth A. Ross]] (1st edn., 1st vol. in 1963; 1st edn., 2nd vol. in 1970), an extensive work in two volumes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10011">In [[coding theory]], an '''erasure code''' is a [[forward error correction]] (FEC) code under the assumption of bit erasures (rather than bit errors), which transforms a message of ''k'' symbols into a longer message (code word) with ''n'' symbols such that the original message can be recovered from a subset of the ''n'' symbols. The fraction ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''/''n'' is called the [[code rate]]. The fraction ''k’/k'', where ''k’'' denotes the number of symbols required for recovery, is called [[reception efficiency]].

==Optimal erasure codes==
Optimal erasure codes have the property that any ''k'' out of the ''n'' code word symbols are sufficient to recover the original message (i.e., they have optimal reception efficiency). Optimal erasure codes are [[Maximum distance separable code#MDS codes|maximum distance separable codes]] (MDS codes).

===Parity check===
{{see also||Parity bit}}
Parity check is the special case where ''n'' = ''k'' + 1. From a set of ''k'' values &lt;math&gt;\{v_i\}_{1\leq i \leq k}&lt;/math&gt;, a checksum is computed and appended to the ''k'' source values:
:&lt;math&gt;v_{k+1}= - \sum_{i=1}^k v_i.&lt;/math&gt;
The set of ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 values &lt;math&gt;\{v_i\}_{1\leq i \leq k+1}&lt;/math&gt; is now consistent with regard to the checksum.
If one of these values, &lt;math&gt;v_e&lt;/math&gt;, is erased, it can be easily recovered by summing the remaining variables:
:&lt;math&gt;v_{e}= - \sum_{i=1 ,i \neq e }^{k+1}v_i.&lt;/math&gt;

===Polynomial oversampling===

====Example: Err-mail (''k'' = 2)====
In the simple case where ''k'' = 2, redundancy symbols may be created by sampling different points along the line between the two original symbols. This is pictured with a simple example, called err-mail:

[[Alice and Bob|Alice]] wants to send her telephone number (555629) to [[Alice and Bob|Bob]] using err-mail. Err-mail works just like e-mail, except 
#About half of all the mail gets lost.&lt;ref&gt;Some versions of this story refer to the err-mail daemon.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Messages longer than 5 characters are illegal.
#It is very expensive (similar to air-mail).

Instead of asking Bob to acknowledge the messages she sends, Alice devises the following scheme.

#She breaks her telephone number up into two parts ''a'' = 555, ''b'' = 629, and sends 2 messages – "A=555" and "B=629" – to Bob.
#She constructs a linear function, &lt;math&gt;f(i) = a + (b-a)(i-1)&lt;/math&gt;, in this case &lt;math&gt;f(i) = 555 + 74(i-1)&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;f(1) = 555&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(2) = 629&lt;/math&gt;.
[[File:Code d'effacement optimal 1.gif]]
#She computes the values ''f''(3), ''f''(4), and ''f''(5), and then transmits three redundant messages: "C=703", "D=777" and "E=851".

Bob knows that the form of ''f''(''k'') is &lt;math&gt;f(i) = a + (b-a)(i-1)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''a'' and ''b'' are the two parts of the telephone number.
Now suppose Bob receives "D=777" and "E=851".

[[File:Code d'effacement optimal 2.gif]]

Bob can reconstruct Alice's phone number by computing the values of ''a'' and ''b'' from the values (''f''(4) and ''f''(5)) he has received. 
Bob can perform this procedure using any two err-mails, so the erasure code in this example has a rate of 40%.

Note that Alice cannot encode her telephone number in just one err-mail, because it contains six characters, and that the maximum length of one err-mail message is five characters. If she sent her phone number in pieces, asking Bob to acknowledge receipt of each piece, at least four messages would have to be sent anyway (two from Alice, and two acknowledgments from Bob). So the erasure code in this example, which requires five messages, is quite economical.

&lt;!-- The reader should also note that --&gt;This example is a little bit contrived&lt;!-- in that the linear function itself actually contains Alice's telephone number, i.e., 555&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;74&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;629.  This makes the given linear function really only useful for the given data --&gt;.  For truly generic erasure codes that work over any data set, we would need something other than the ''f''(''i'') given.

====General case====
The linear construction above can be generalized to [[polynomial interpolation]]. Additionally, points are now computed over a [[finite field]].

First we choose a finite field ''F'' with order of at least ''n'', but usually a power of 2. The sender numbers the data symbols from 0 to ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 and sends them. He then constructs a [[Lagrange polynomial|(Lagrange) polynomial]] ''p''(''x'') of order ''k'' such that ''p''(''i'') is equal to data symbol ''i''. He then sends ''p''(''k''), ..., ''p''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1). The receiver can now also use polynomial interpolation to recover the lost packets, provided he receives ''k'' symbols successfully. If the order of ''F'' is less than 2&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;, where b is the number of bits in a symbol, then multiple polynomials can be used.

The sender can construct symbols ''k'' to ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 'on the fly', i.e., distribute the workload evenly between transmission of the symbols. If the receiver wants to do his calculations 'on the fly', he can construct a new polynomial ''q'', such that ''q''(''i'') = ''p''(''i'') if symbol ''i'' &lt; ''k'' was received successfully and ''q''(''i'') = 0 when symbol ''i'' &lt; ''k'' was not received. Now let ''r''(''i'') = ''p''(''i'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''q''(''i''). Firstly we know that ''r''(''i'') = 0 if symbol ''i'' &lt; ''k'' has been received successfully. Secondly, if symbol ''i'' ≥''k'' has been received successfully, then ''r''(''i'') = ''p''(''i'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''q''(''i'') can be calculated. So we have enough data points to construct ''r'' and evaluate it to find the lost packets. So both the sender and the receiver require ''O''(''n'' (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'')) operations and only ''O''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'') space for operating 'on the fly'.

====Real world implementation====
This process is implemented by [[Reed–Solomon code]]s, with code words constructed over a [[finite field]] using a [[Vandermonde matrix]].

==Near-optimal erasure codes==
''Near-optimal erasure codes'' require (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε)''k'' symbols to recover the message (where ε&gt;0). Reducing ε can be done at the cost of CPU time.
''Near-optimal erasure codes'' trade correction capabilities for computational complexity: practical algorithms can encode and decode with linear time complexity.

[[Fountain code]]s (also known as ''rateless erasure codes'') are notable examples of ''near-optimal erasure codes''. They can transform a ''k'' symbol message into a practically infinite encoded form, i.e., they can generate an arbitrary amount of redundancy symbols that can all be used for error correction. Receivers can start decoding after they have received slightly more than ''k'' encoded symbols.

[[Regenerating code]]s address the issue of rebuilding (also called repairing) lost encoded fragments from existing encoded fragments. This issue occurs in distributed 
storage systems where communication to maintain encoded redundancy is a problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">In [[mathematics]], the '''Fictitious domain method''' is a method to find the solution of a [[partial differential equation]]s on a complicated [[Domain of a function|domain]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, by substituting  a given  problem
posed on a domain &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, with a new problem posed on a simple domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.

==General formulation==
Assume in some area &lt;math&gt;D \subset \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt; we want to find solution &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; of the [[equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
 Lu = - \phi(x), x = (x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n) \in D
&lt;/math&gt;

with [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
 lu = g(x), x \in \partial D
&lt;/math&gt;

The basic idea of fictitious domains method is to substitute  a given  problem
posed on a domain &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, with a new problem posed on a simple [[shaped domain]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;D \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt;). For example, we can choose ''n''-dimensional parallelepiped as &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

Problem in the [[extended domain]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; for the new solution &lt;math&gt;u_{\epsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
 L_\epsilon u_\epsilon = - \phi^\epsilon(x), x = (x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n) \in \Omega
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
 l_\epsilon u_\epsilon = g^\epsilon(x), x \in \partial \Omega
&lt;/math&gt;

It is necessary to pose the problem in the extended area so that the following condition is fulfilled:

: &lt;math&gt;
 u_\epsilon (x) \xrightarrow[\epsilon \rightarrow 0]{ } u(x), x \in D
&lt;/math&gt;

== Simple example, 1-dimensional problem ==

:&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = -2, \quad 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \quad (1) 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
 u(0) = 0, u(1) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Prolongation by leading coefficients ===

&lt;math&gt;u_\epsilon(x)&lt;/math&gt; solution of problem:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d}{dx}k^\epsilon(x)\frac{du_\epsilon}{dx} = - \phi^{\epsilon}(x), 0 &lt; x &lt; 2 \quad (2)
&lt;/math&gt;
Discontinuous [[coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;k^{\epsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt; and right part of equation previous equation we obtain from expressions:

: &lt;math&gt;
k^\epsilon (x)=\begin{cases} 1, &amp;  0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \\ \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}, &amp; 1 &lt; x &lt; 2
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\phi^\epsilon (x)=\begin{cases} 2, &amp;  0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \\ 2c_0, &amp; 1 &lt; x &lt; 2 
 \end{cases}\quad (3)
&lt;/math&gt;

Boundary conditions:

: &lt;math&gt;
 u_\epsilon(0) = 0, u_\epsilon(2) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Connection conditions in the point &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
 [u_\epsilon] = 0,\  \left[k^\epsilon(x)\frac{du_\epsilon}{dx}\right] = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;[ \cdot ]&lt;/math&gt; means:

: &lt;math&gt;
 [p(x)] = p(x + 0) - p(x - 0)
&lt;/math&gt;

Equation (1) has [[analytical solution]] therefore we can easily obtain error:

: &lt;math&gt;
 u(x) - u_\epsilon(x) = O(\epsilon^2), \quad 0 &lt; x &lt; 1
&lt;/math&gt;

===Prolongation by lower-order coefficients===
&lt;math&gt;u_\epsilon(x)&lt;/math&gt; solution of problem:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d^2u_\epsilon}{dx^2} - c^\epsilon(x)u_\epsilon = - \phi^\epsilon(x), \quad 0 &lt; x &lt; 2 \quad (4)
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\phi^{\epsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt; we take the same as in (3), and expression for &lt;math&gt;c^{\epsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
c^\epsilon(x)=\begin{cases} 
  0,                    &amp;  0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \\ 
  \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}, &amp; 1 &lt; x &lt; 2.
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Boundary conditions for equation (4) same as for (2).

Connection conditions in the point &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
 [u_\epsilon(0)] = 0,\  \left[\frac{du_\epsilon}{dx}\right] = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Error:

: &lt;math&gt;
 u(x) - u_\epsilon(x) = O(\epsilon), \quad 0 &lt; x &lt; 1
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5579">In [[statistics]], '''Fieller's theorem''' allows the calculation of a [[confidence interval]] for the ratio of two [[arithmetic mean|means]].

==Approximate confidence interval==
Variables ''a'' and ''b'' may be measured in different units, so there is no way to directly combine the [[standard error]]s as they may also be in different units. The most complete discussion of this is given by Fieller (1954).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fieller, EC. |title=Some problems in interval estimation. |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B]] |volume=16 |issue= 2|pages=175–185 |year=1954 |jstor=2984043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fieller showed that if ''a'' and ''b'' are (possibly [[correlation|correlated]]) [[sample mean|means of two samples]] with [[expected value|expectations]] &lt;math&gt;\mu_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_b&lt;/math&gt;, and variances &lt;math&gt;\nu_{11}\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu_{22}\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; and covariance &lt;math&gt;\nu_{12}\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;\nu_{11}, \nu_{12}, \nu_{22} &lt;/math&gt; are all known, then a (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''α'') confidence interval (''m''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;) for &lt;math&gt;\mu_a/\mu_b&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;(m_L, m_{U}) = \frac{1}{(1-g)} \left[\frac{a}{b} - \frac{g\nu_{12}}{\nu_{22}} \mp \frac{t_{r,\alpha}s}{b} \sqrt{\nu_{11} - 2\frac{a}{b}\nu_{12} + \frac{a^2}{b^2} \nu_{22} - g\left(\nu_{11} - \frac{\nu_{12}^2}{\nu_{22}}\right)} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g=\frac{t^{2}_{r,\alpha}s^2\nu_{22}}{b^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;s^2&lt;/math&gt; is an [[bias of an estimator|unbiased estimator]] of &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; based on r degrees of freedom, and &lt;math&gt;t_{r,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-level deviate from the [[Student's t-distribution]] based on ''r'' degrees of freedom.

Three features of this formula are important in this context:

a) The expression inside the square root has to be positive, or else the resulting interval will be imaginary.

b) When ''g'' is very close to 1, the confidence interval is infinite.

c) When ''g'' is greater than 1, the overall divisor outside the square brackets is negative and the confidence interval is exclusive.

== Other methods ==

One problem is that, when ''g'' is not small, the confidence interval can blow up when using Fieller's theorem. Andy Grieve has provided a Bayesian solution where the CIs are still sensible, albeit wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Hagan A, Stevens JW, Montmartin J | title=Inference for the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve and cost-effectiveness ratio. |journal=[[PharmacoEconomics (journal)|Pharmacoeconomics]] |volume=17|issue=4 |pages=339–49 |year=2000 |doi=10.2165/00019053-200017040-00004 |pmid=10947489}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|Bootstrapping]] provides another alternative that does not require the assumption of normality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=M.

== History ==
Edgar C. Fieller (1907&amp;ndash;1960) first started working on this problem while in [[Karl Pearson]]'s group at [[University College London]], where he was employed for five years after graduating in Mathematics from [[King's College, Cambridge]]. He then worked for the [[Boots UK|Boots Pure Drug Company]] as a statistician and [[operational research]]er before becoming deputy head of operational research at [[RAF Fighter Command]] during the [[Second World War]], after which he was appointed the first head of the Statistics Section at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Irwin, J.

'''''Geometric Algebra''''' is a book written by [[Emil Artin]] and published by [[Interscience Publishers]], New York, in 1957. It was republished in 1988 in the Wiley Classics series ({{ISBN|0-471-60839-4}}).

In 1962 ''Algèbra Géométrique'', translation into French by M. Lazard, was published by Gauthier-Villars, and reprinted in 1996. ({{ISBN|2-87647-089-6}}) In 1968 a translation into Italian was published in Milan by Feltrinelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{mr|id=0256245}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 a translation into Russian was published in Moscow by Nauka&lt;ref&gt;{{mr|id=0242847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long anticipated as the sequel to ''[[Moderne Algebra]]'' (1930), which [[Bartel van der Waerden]] published as his version of notes taken in a course with Artin, ''Geometric Algebra'' is a research monograph suitable for graduate students studying mathematics. From the Preface:
:Linear algebra, topology, differential and algebraic geometry are the indispensable tools of the mathematician of our time. It is frequently desirable to devise a course of geometric nature which is distinct from these great lines of thought and which can be presented to beginning graduate students or even to advanced undergraduates. The present book has grown out of lecture notes for a course of this nature given a New York University in 1955. This course centered around the foundations of affine geometry, the geometry of quadratic forms and the structure of the general linear group. I felt it necessary to enlarge the content of these notes by including projective and [[symplectic geometry]] and also the structure of the symplectic and [[orthogonal group]]s.

The book is illustrated with six [[geometric configuration]]s in chapter 2, which retraces the path from geometric to [[field axioms]] previously explored by [[Karl von Staudt]] and [[David Hilbert]].

==Contents==
Chapter one is titled "Preliminary Notions". The ten sections explicate notions of [[set theory]], [[vector space]]s, [[homomorphism]]s, [[duality (linear algebra)|duality]], [[linear equation]]s, [[group theory]], [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], [[ordered field]]s and [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]]s. On page vii Artin says "Chapter I should be used mainly as a reference chapter for the proofs of certain isolated theorems."

[[File:Pappus-aff.svg |right|thumb|300px|Pappus's hexagon theorem holds if and only if ''k'' is commutative]]
Chapter two is titled "Affine and Projective Geometry". Artin posits this challenge to generate algebra (a field ''k'') from geometric axioms:
:Given a plane geometry whose objects are the elements of two sets, the set of points and the set of lines; assume that certain axioms of a geometric nature are true. Is it possible to find a field ''k'' such that the points of our geometry can be described by coordinates from ''k'' and the lines by linear equations ?
The [[parallel lines#Reflexive variant|reflexive variant of parallelism]] is invoked: parallel lines have either all or none of their points in common. Thus a line is parallel to itself.

Axiom 1 requires a unique line for each pair of distinct points, and a unique point of intersection of non-parallel lines. Axiom 2 depends on a line and a point; it requires a unique parallel ''to'' the line and ''through'' the point. Axiom 3 requires three non-collinear points. Axiom 4a requires a translation to move any point to any other. Axiom 4b requires a dilation at ''P'' to move ''Q'' to ''R'' when the three points are [[collinear]].

Artin writes the line through ''P'' and ''Q'' as ''P'' + ''Q''. To define a ''dilation'' he writes, "Let two distinct points ''P'' and ''Q'' and their images ''P''′ and ''Q''′ be given." To suggest the role of [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]] in geometry, a dilation is specified by this property: "If ''l''′ is the line parallel to ''P'' + ''Q'' which passes through ''P''′, then ''Q''′ lies on ''l''′." Of course, if ''P''′ ≠ ''Q''′, then this condition implies ''P'' + ''Q'' is parallel to ''P''′ + ''Q''′, so that the dilation is an [[affine transformation]].

The dilations with no [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s are [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s, and the group of translations ''T'' is shown to be an [[invariant subgroup]] of the group of dilations. 
For a dilation ''σ'' and a point ''P'', the ''trace'' is ''P'' + ''σP''. The mappings ''T'' → ''T'' that are trace-preserving homomorphisms are the elements of ''k''. First ''k'' is shown to be an [[ring (mathematics)|associative ring with 1]], then a [[skew field]].

Conversely, there is an [[affine geometry]] based on any given skew field ''k''. Axioms 4a and 4b are equivalent to [[Desargues' theorem]]. When [[Pappus's hexagon theorem]] holds in the affine geometry, ''k'' is [[commutative property|commutative]] and hence a field.

Chapter three is titled "Symplectic and Orthogonal Geometry". It begins with metric structures on vector spaces before defining symplectic and orthogonal geometry and describing their common and special features. There are sections on geometry over [[finite field]]s and over ordered fields.

Chapter four is on [[general linear group]]s. First there is [[Jean Dieudonne]]'s theory of [[determinant]]s over "non-commutative fields" ([[division ring]]s). Artin describes GL(''n, k'') group structure. More details are given about vector spaces over finite fields.

Chapter five is "The Structure of Sympletic and Orthogonal Groups". It includes sections on [[elliptic space]]s, [[Clifford algebra]], and spinorial norm.

==Reviews==
[[Alice T. Schafer]] wrote "Mathematicians will find on many pages ample evidence of the author’s ability to penetrate a subject and to present material in a particularly elegant manner." She notes the overlap between Artin's text and Baer's ''Linear Algebra and Projective Geometry'' or Dieudonné's ''La Géometrie des Groupes Classique''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Geometric Algebra'' by Emil Artin|author=Schafer, Alice T.|authorlink=Alice T.

Jean Dieudonné reviewed the book for [[Mathematical Reviews]] and placed it on a level with Hilbert's ''Grundlagen der Geometrie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{mr|id=0082463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Group action on equilateral triangle.svg|right|thumb|Given an [[equilateral triangle]], the counterclockwise [[rotation]] by 120° around the center of the triangle maps every vertex of the triangle to another one. The [[cyclic group]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; consisting of the rotations by 0°, 120° and 240° acts on the set of the three vertices.]]

In [[mathematics]], an '''action''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a formal way of interpreting the manner in which the elements of the group correspond to transformations of some [[Space (mathematics)|space]] in a way that preserves the [[mathematical structure|structure]] of that space. Common examples of spaces that groups act on are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[vector spaces]], and [[topological spaces]]. Actions of groups on vector spaces are called [[Group representation|representations]] of the group.

When there is a natural correspondence between the set of group elements and the set of space transformations, a group can be interpreted as acting on the space in a [[canonical map|canonical]] way. For example, the [[symmetric group]] of a finite [[set (mathematics)|set]] consists of all [[bijective]] transformations of that set; thus, applying any element of the permutation group to an element of the set will produce another (not necessarily distinct) element of the set. More generally, [[symmetry groups]] such as the [[homeomorphism group]] of a [[topological space]] or the [[general linear group]] of a [[vector space]], as well as their subgroups, also admit canonical actions. For other groups, an interpretation of the group in terms of an action may have to be specified, either because the group does not act canonically on any space or because the canonical action is not the action of interest. For example, we can specify an action of the two-element [[cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C}_2 = \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; on the finite set &lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt; by specifying that 0 (the identity element) sends &lt;math&gt;a\mapsto a,b\mapsto b,c\mapsto c&lt;/math&gt;, and that 1 sends &lt;math&gt;a\mapsto b,b\mapsto a,c\mapsto c&lt;/math&gt;. This action is not canonical.

A common way of specifying non-canonical actions is to describe a [[homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; from a group ''G'' to the group of symmetries of a set ''X''. The action of an element &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; on a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be identical to the action of its image &lt;math&gt;\varphi(g) \in \text{Sym}(X)&lt;/math&gt; on the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is also frequently called the "action" of ''G'', since specifying &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to specifying an action. Thus, if ''G'' is a group and ''X'' is a set, then an action of ''G'' on ''X'' may be formally defined as a [[group homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; from ''G'' to the [[symmetric group]] of ''X''. The action assigns a [[permutation]] of ''X'' to each element of the group in such a way that:
* the [[identity element]] of ''G'' is assigned the [[identity transformation]] of ''X'';
* any product ''gk'' of two elements of ''G'' is assigned the [[function composition|composition]] of the permutations assigned to ''g'' and&amp;nbsp;''k''.
If ''X'' has additional structure, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is only called an action if for each &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, the permutation &lt;math&gt;\varphi(g)&lt;/math&gt; preserves the structure of&amp;nbsp;''X''.

The [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] provided by group actions is a powerful one, because it allows geometrical ideas to be applied to more abstract objects. Many objects in mathematics have natural group actions defined on them. In particular, groups can act on other groups, or even on themselves. Because of this generality, the theory of group actions contains wide-reaching [[theorem]]s, such as the orbit stabilizer theorem, which can be used to prove deep results in several fields.

== Definition ==
If ''G'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and ''X'' is a set, then a (''left'') ''group action'' ''&amp;phi;'' of ''G'' on ''X'' is a function
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi\colon G \times X \to X\colon (g,x)\mapsto \varphi(g,x)&lt;/math&gt;
that satisfies the following two axioms (where we denote ''&amp;phi;''(''g'', ''x'') as ''g''⋅''x''):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eie &amp; Chang |title=A Course on Abstract Algebra|year=2010|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=jozIZ0qrkk8C|page=144|text=group action}}|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Identity: {{nowrap|1=''e''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} for all ''x'' in ''X''. (Here, ''e'' denotes the identity element of the group ''G''.)
; Compatibility: {{nowrap|1=(''gh'')⋅''x'' = ''g''⋅(''h''⋅''x'')}} for all ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X''. (Here, ''gh'' denotes the result of applying the group operation of ''G'' to the elements ''g'' and ''h''.)

The group ''G'' is said to act on ''X'' (on the left). The set ''X'' is called a (''left'') ''G-set''.

From these two axioms, it follows that for every ''g'' in ''G'', the function which maps ''x'' in ''X'' to ''g''⋅''x'' is a [[bijective function|bijective map]] from ''X'' to ''X'' (its [[inverse function|inverse]] being the function which maps ''x'' to ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''x''). Therefore, one may alternatively define a group action of ''G'' on ''X'' as a [[group homomorphism]] from ''G'' into the [[symmetric group]] Sym(''X'') of all bijections from ''X'' to ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;This is done, e.g., by {{cite book|author=Smith |title=Introduction to abstract algebra|year=2008|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=PQUAQh04lrUC|page=253|text=group action}}|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In complete analogy, one can define a ''right group action'' of ''G'' on ''X'' as an operation {{nowrap|''X'' × ''G'' → ''X''}} mapping {{nowrap|(''x'', ''g'')}} to ''x''⋅''g'' and satisfying the two axioms:
; Identity: {{nowrap|1=''x''⋅''e'' = ''x''}} for all ''x'' in ''X''.
; Compatibility: {{nowrap|1=''x''⋅(''gh'') = (''x''⋅''g'')⋅''h''}} for all ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X'';

The difference between left and right actions is in the order in which a product like ''gh'' acts on ''x''. For a left action ''h'' acts first and is followed by ''g'', while for a right action ''g'' acts first and is followed by ''h''. Because of the formula {{nowrap|1=(''gh'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, one can construct a left action from a right action by composing with the inverse operation of the group. Also, a right action of a group ''G'' on ''X'' is the same thing as a left action of its [[opposite group]] ''G''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; on ''X''. It is thus sufficient to only consider left actions without any loss of generality.

== Types of actions ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Diffeomorphism]], and redirected from "Transitive action" --&gt;
The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is called
* ''{{visible anchor|Transitive}}'' if ''X'' is non-empty and if for each pair ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'' there exists a ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''y''}}. For example, the action of the symmetric group of ''X'' is transitive, the action of the [[general linear group]] or the [[special linear group]] of a vector space ''V'' on {{nowrap|''V'' ∖ {0}{{null}}}} is transitive, but the action of the [[orthogonal group]] of a [[Euclidean space]] ''E'' is not transitive on {{nowrap|''E'' ∖ {0}{{null}}}} (it is transitive on the [[unit sphere]] of ''E'', though).
* ''{{visible anchor|Faithful}}'' (or ''{{visible anchor|effective}}'') if for every two distinct ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' ≠ ''h''⋅''x''}}; or equivalently, if for each {{nowrap|''g'' ≠ ''e''}} in ''G'' there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' such that {{nowrap|''g''⋅''x'' ≠ ''x''}}.  In other words, in a faithful group action, different elements of ''G'' induce different permutations of ''X''. In algebraic terms, a group ''G'' acts faithfully on ''X'' [[if and only if]] the corresponding homomorphism to the symmetric group, {{nowrap|''G'' → Sym(''X'')}}, has a trivial [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]]. Thus, for a faithful action, ''G'' embeds into a [[permutation group]] on ''X''; specifically, ''G'' is isomorphic to its image in Sym(''X''). If ''G'' does not act faithfully on ''X'', one can easily modify the group to obtain a faithful action. If we define {{nowrap|1=''N'' = {''g'' in ''G'' : ''g''⋅''x'' = ''x'' for all ''x'' in ''X''}{{null}}}}, then ''N'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of ''G''; indeed, it is the kernel of the homomorphism {{nowrap|''G'' → Sym(''X'')}}. The [[factor group]] ''G''/''N'' acts faithfully on ''X'' by setting {{nowrap|1=(''gN'')⋅''x'' = ''g''⋅''x''}}. The original action of ''G'' on ''X'' is faithful if and only if {{nowrap|1=''N'' = {''e''}{{null}}}}.
* ''{{visible anchor|Free}}'' (or ''semiregular'' or ''fixed point free'') if, given ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'', the existence of an ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''h''⋅''x''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''h''}}. Equivalently: if ''g'' is a group element and there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} (that is, if ''g'' has at least one fixed point), then ''g'' is the identity. Note that a free action on a [[non-empty]] set is faithful.
* ''{{visible anchor|Regular}}'' (or ''{{visible anchor|simply transitive}}'' or ''sharply transitive'') if it is both transitive and free; this is equivalent to saying that for every two ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'' there exists precisely one ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''y''}}.  In this case, ''X'' is called a [[principal homogeneous space]] for ''G'' or a ''G''-torsor. The action of any group ''G'' on itself by left multiplication is regular, and thus faithful as well. Every group can, therefore, be embedded in the symmetric group on its own elements, Sym(''G''). This result is known as [[Cayley's theorem]].
* ''{{visible anchor|n-transitive}}'' if ''X'' has at least ''n'' elements and for all pairwise distinct ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and pairwise distinct ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' there is a ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n''}}.  A 2-transitive action is also called ''{{visible anchor|doubly transitive}}'', a 3-transitive action is also called ''triply transitive'', and so on.  Such actions define interesting classes of subgroups in the symmetric groups: [[2-transitive group]]s and more generally [[multiply transitive group]]s. The action of the symmetric group on a set with ''n'' elements is always ''n''-transitive; the action of the [[alternating group]] is ''n-2''-transitive.
* ''{{visible anchor|Sharply n-transitive}}'' if there is exactly one such ''g''.
* ''{{visible anchor|Primitive}}'' if it is transitive and preserves no non-trivial partition of ''X''. See [[primitive permutation group]] for details.
* ''Locally free'' if ''G'' is a [[topological group]], and there is a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] ''U'' of ''e'' in ''G'' such that the restriction of the action to ''U'' is free; that is, if  {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} for some ''x'' and some ''g'' in ''U'' then {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''e''}}.

Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts on a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then the action is:

*''Wandering'' if every point &lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt; has a neighbourhood &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{g \in G : g \cdot U \cap U \neq \emptyset\}&lt;/math&gt; is finite.&lt;ref name="Thurston 1980 p175"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Thurston | first1=William | title=The geometry and topology of three-manifolds | url=http://library.msri.org/books/gt3m/ | series=Princeton lecture notes | year=1980 | page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the action of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z^n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; by translations is wandering. The action of the [[modular group]] on the Poincaré half-plane is also wandering.
*''Properly discontinuous'' if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[locally compact space]] and for every compact subset &lt;math&gt;K \subset X&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;\{g \in G: gK \cap K \neq \emptyset \}&lt;/math&gt; is finite.

[[File:Compound of five tetrahedra.png|thumb|In the [[compound of five tetrahedra]], the symmetry group is the (rotational) [[icosahedral group]] ''I'' of order 60, while the stabilizer of a single chosen tetrahedron is the (rotational) [[tetrahedral group]] ''T'' of order 12, and the orbit space ''I''/''T'' (of order 60/12&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5) is naturally identified with the 5 tetrahedra – the coset ''gT'' corresponds to the tetrahedron to which ''g'' sends the chosen tetrahedron.]]

Consider a group ''G'' acting on a set ''X''. The ''orbit'' of an element ''x'' in ''X'' is the set of elements in ''X'' to which ''x'' can be moved by the elements of ''G''. The orbit of ''x'' is denoted by ''G''⋅''x'':

:&lt;math&gt; G\cdot x = \left\{ g\cdot x \mid g \in G \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The defining properties of a group guarantee that the set of orbits of (points ''x'' in) ''X'' under the action of ''G'' form a [[partition of a set|partition]] of ''X''. The associated [[equivalence relation]] is defined by saying {{nowrap|''x'' ∼ ''y''}} [[if and only if]] there exists a ''g'' in ''G'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''y''}}. The orbits are then the [[equivalence class]]es under this relation; two elements ''x'' and ''y'' are equivalent if and only if their orbits are the same; i.e., {{nowrap|1=''G''⋅''x'' = ''G''⋅''y''}}.

The group action is [[Group action#Types of actions|transitive]] if and only if it has exactly one orbit, i.e., if there exists ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''G''⋅''x'' = ''X''}}. This is the case if and only if {{nowrap|1=''G''⋅''x'' = ''X''}} for ''all'' ''x'' in ''X''.

The set of all orbits of ''X'' under the action of ''G'' is written as ''X''/''G'' (or, less frequently: ''G''\''X''), and is called the ''quotient'' of the action. In geometric situations it may be called the ''{{visible anchor|orbit space}}'', while in algebraic situations it may be called the space of ''{{visible anchor|coinvariants}}'', and written ''X&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'',  by contrast with the invariants (fixed points), denoted ''X&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'': the coinvariants are a ''quotient'' while the invariants are a ''subset.'' The coinvariant terminology and notation are used particularly in [[group cohomology]] and [[group homology]], which use the same superscript/subscript convention.

===Invariant subsets===
If ''Y'' is a [[subset]] of ''X'', we write ''GY'' for the set {{nowrap|{ ''g''⋅''y'' : ''y'' ∈ ''Y'' and ''g'' ∈ ''G''}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}. We call the subset ''Y'' ''invariant under G'' if {{nowrap|1=''G''⋅''Y'' = ''Y''}} (which is equivalent to {{nowrap|''G''⋅''Y'' ⊆ ''Y''}}). In that case, ''G'' also operates on ''Y'' by restricting the action to ''Y''. The subset ''Y'' is called ''fixed under G'' if {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''y'' = ''y''}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''y'' in ''Y''. Every subset that is fixed under ''G'' is also invariant under ''G'', but not vice versa.

Every orbit is an invariant subset of ''X'' on which ''G'' acts [[Group action#Types of actions|transitively]]. The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is ''transitive'' if and only if all elements are equivalent, meaning that there is only one orbit.

A ''G-invariant'' element of ''X'' is {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} for all {{nowrap|''g'' ∈ ''G''}}. The set of all such ''x'' is denoted ''X&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'' and called the ''G-invariants'' of ''X''. When ''X'' is a [[G-module|''G''-module]], ''X&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the zeroth [[group cohomology]] group of ''G'' with coefficients in ''X'', and the higher cohomology groups are the [[derived functor]]s of the [[functor]] of ''G''-invariants.

===Fixed points and stabilizer subgroups===
Given ''g'' in ''G'' and ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}}, we say ''x'' is a fixed point of ''g'' and ''g'' fixes ''x''.

For every ''x'' in ''X'', we define the ''stabilizer subgroup'' of ''G'' with respect to ''x'' (also called the ''isotropy group'' or ''little group''&lt;ref name="Procesi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Procesi|first1=Claudio|title=Lie Groups: An Approach through Invariants and Representations|date=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387289298|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sl8OAGYRz_AC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22little+group%22+action&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP0P3X5qbSAhXriFQKHfNLDDsQ6AEIODAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22little%20group%22%20action&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as the set of all elements in ''G'' that fix ''x'':
:&lt;math&gt;G_x = \{g \in G \mid g \cdot x = x\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a [[subgroup]] of ''G'', though typically not a normal one. The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is [[Group action#Types of actions|free]] if and only if all stabilizers are trivial. The kernel ''N'' of the homomorphism with the symmetric group, {{nowrap|''G'' → Sym(''X'')}}, is given by the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the stabilizers ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all ''x'' in ''X''. If ''N'' is trivial, the action is said to be faithful (or effective).

Let ''x'' and ''y'' be two elements in ''X'', and let ''g'' be a group element such that {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''g''⋅''x''}}. Then the two stabilizer groups ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''G&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' are related by {{nowrap|1=''G&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''g'' ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Proof: by definition, {{nowrap|''h'' &amp;isin; ''G&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''h''⋅(''g''⋅''x'') = ''g''⋅''x''}}. Applying ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to both sides of this equality yields {{nowrap|1=(''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''hg'')⋅''x'' = ''x''}}; that is, {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''hg'' &amp;isin; ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. An opposite inclusion follows similarly by taking {{nowrap|''h'' &amp;isin; ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and supposing {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''y''}}.

The above says that the stabilizers of elements in the same orbit are [[Conjugacy class|conjugate]] to each other. Thus, to each orbit, one can associate a conjugacy class of a subgroup of ''G'' (i.e., the set of all conjugates of the subgroup). Let &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt; denote the conjugacy class of ''H''. Then one says that the orbit ''O'' has type &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt; if the stabilizer &lt;math&gt;G_x&lt;/math&gt; of some/any ''x'' in ''O'' belongs to &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt;. A maximal orbit type is often called a [[principal orbit type]].

==={{visible anchor|Orbit-stabilizer theorem}} and Burnside's lemma===
Orbits and stabilizers are closely related. For a fixed &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, consider the map &lt;math&gt;G\to X&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;g \mapsto g\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;. This map induces a bijection from the set &lt;math&gt;G/G_x&lt;/math&gt; of  [[coset]]s of &lt;math&gt;G_x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to the orbit &lt;math&gt;G\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, as the translate &lt;math&gt;g\cdot x&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the left coset &lt;math&gt;gG_x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Artin, &lt;em&gt;Algebra&lt;/em&gt;, Proposition 6.4 on p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;. This result is known as the ''orbit-stabilizer theorem''. 

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is finite then the orbit-stabilizer theorem, together with [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], gives
:&lt;math&gt;|G\cdot x| = [G\,:\,G_x] = |G| / |G_x|.&lt;/math&gt;

This result is especially useful since it can be employed for counting arguments (typically in situations where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite as well).

[[File:Labeled cube graph.png|thumb|Cubical graph with vertices labeled]]
: '''Example:'''  One can use the orbit-stabilizer theorem to count the automorphisms of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. Consider the [[cubical graph]] as pictured, and let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; denote its [[Graph automorphism|automorphism]] group. Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts on the set of vertices &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,\ldots,8\}&lt;/math&gt;, and this action is transitive as can be seen by composing rotations about the center of the cube. Thus, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we have that &lt;math&gt;|G| = |G\cdot1||G_1| = 8|G_1|&lt;/math&gt;. Applying the theorem now to the stabilizer &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain &lt;math&gt;|G_1| = |(G_1)\cdot2||(G_1)_2|&lt;/math&gt;. Any element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that fixes &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; must send &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; to either &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;. There are such automorphisms; consider for example the map that transposes &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, transposes &lt;math&gt;6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;8&lt;/math&gt;, and fixes the other vertices. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\left|(G_1)\cdot2\right| = 3&lt;/math&gt;. Applying the theorem a third time gives &lt;math&gt;|(G_1)_2| = |((G_1)_2)\cdot3||((G_1)_2)_3|&lt;/math&gt;. Any element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that fixes &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; must send &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; to either &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;6&lt;/math&gt;, and one easily finds such automorphisms. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\left|((G_1)_2)\cdot3\right| = 2&lt;/math&gt;. One also sees that &lt;math&gt;((G_1)_2)_3&lt;/math&gt; consists only of the identity automorphism, as any element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; fixing &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; must also fix &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; and consequently all other vertices. Combining the preceding calculations, we now obtain &lt;math&gt;|G| = 8\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1 = 48&lt;/math&gt;.

A result closely related to the orbit-stabilizer theorem is [[Burnside's lemma]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\left|X/G\right|=\frac{1}{\left|G\right|}\sum_{g\in G}\left|X^g\right|&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;X^g&lt;/math&gt; the set of points fixed by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. This result is mainly of use when &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are finite, when it can be interpreted as follows: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of points fixed per group element.

Fixing a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, the set of formal differences of finite &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-sets forms a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] called the [[Burnside ring]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, where addition corresponds to [[disjoint union]], and multiplication to [[Cartesian product]].

== Examples ==
* The ''{{visible anchor|trivial}}'' action of any group ''G'' on any set ''X'' is defined by {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X''; that is, every group element induces the [[identity function|identity permutation]] on ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eie &amp; Chang |title=A Course on Abstract Algebra|year=2010|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=jozIZ0qrkk8C|page=144|text=trivial action}}|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In every group ''G'', left multiplication is an action of ''G'' on ''G'': {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''gx''}} for all ''g'', ''x'' in ''G''. This action forms the basis of a rapid proof of [[Cayley's theorem]] - that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group of permutations of the set ''G''.
* In every group ''G'' with subgroup ''H'', left multiplication is an action of ''G'' on the set of cosets ''G/H'': {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''aH'' = ''gaH''}} for all ''g'',''a'' in ''G''. In particular if H contains no nontrivial normal subgroups of ''G'' this induces an isomorphism from ''G'' to a subgroup of the permutation group of degree ''[G : H]''.
* In every group ''G'', [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] is an action of ''G'' on ''G'': {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''gxg''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. An exponential notation is commonly used for the right-action variant: {{nowrap|1=''x&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''xg''}}; it satisfies ({{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''gh''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
* In every group ''G'' with subgroup ''H'', [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] is an action of ''G'' on conjugates of ''H'': {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''K'' = ''gKg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and ''K'' conjugates of ''H''.
* The [[symmetric group]] S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and its [[subgroup]]s act on the set {{nowrap|{ 1, …, ''n'' }&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} by permuting its elements
* The [[symmetry group]] of a [[polyhedron]] acts on the set of vertices of that polyhedron. It also acts on the set of faces or the set of edges of the polyhedron.
* The symmetry group of any geometrical object acts on the set of points of that object.
* The [[automorphism group]] of a [[vector space]] (or [[graph theory|graph]], or group, or [[ring (algebra)|ring]]…) acts on the vector space (or set of vertices of the graph, or group, or ring…).
* The [[general linear group]] {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''K'')}} and its subgroups, particularly its [[Lie subgroup]]s (including the [[special linear group]] {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''K'')}}, [[orthogonal group]] {{nowrap|O(''n'', ''K'')}}, special orthogonal group {{nowrap|SO(''n'', ''K'')}}, and [[symplectic group]] {{nowrap|Sp(''n'', ''K'')}}) are [[Lie group]]s that act on the [[vector space]] ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The group operations are given by multiplying the matrices from the groups with the vectors from ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The [[general linear group]] {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''Z''')}} acts on '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; by natural matrix action. The orbits of its action are classified by the greatest common divisor of coordinates of the vector in '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The [[affine group]] acts [[#Types of actions|transitively]] on the points of an [[affine space]], and the subgroup V of the affine group (i.e., a vector space) transitive and free (i.e., ''regular'') action on these points;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geometry and topology|last=Reid|first=Miles|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780521613255|location=Cambridge, UK New York|pages=170|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed this can be used to give a definition of an [[Affine space#Definition|affine space]].
* The [[projective linear group]] {{nowrap|PGL(''n'' + 1, ''K'')}} and its subgroups, particularly its Lie subgroups, which are Lie groups that act on the [[projective space]] '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(''K''). This is a quotient of the action of the general linear group on projective space. Particularly notable is {{nowrap|PGL(2, ''K'')}}, the symmetries of the projective line, which is sharply 3-transitive, preserving the [[cross ratio]]; the [[Möbius group]] {{nowrap|PGL(2, '''C''')}} is of particular interest.
*The [[Isometry|isometries]] of the plane act on the set of 2D images and patterns, such as [[wallpaper group|wallpaper pattern]]s. The definition can be made more precise by specifying what is meant by image or pattern; e.g., a function of position with values in a set of colors. Isometries are in fact one example of affine group (action).{{dubious|reason=The isometries of a space are a subgroup of the affine group of that space, but not an affine group in themselves|date=March 2015}}
*The sets acted on by a group G comprise the category of G-sets in which the objects are G-sets and the morphisms are G-set homomorphisms: functions {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅(''f''(''x'')) = ''f''(''g''⋅''x'')}} for every ''g'' in ''G''.
* The [[Galois group]] of a [[field extension]] ''L''/''K'' acts on the field L but has only a trivial action on elements of the subfield K. Subgroups of Gal(L/K) correspond to subfields of L that contain K, i.e., intermediate field extensions between L and K.
* The additive group of the [[real number]]s {{nowrap|('''R''', +)}} acts on the [[phase space]] of "[[well-behaved]]" systems in [[classical mechanics]] (and in more general [[dynamical systems]]) by [[time translation]]: if ''t'' is in '''R''' and ''x'' is in the phase space, then ''x'' describes a state of the system, and {{nowrap|''t'' + ''x''}} is defined to be the state of the system ''t'' seconds later if ''t'' is positive or &amp;minus;''t'' seconds ago if ''t'' is negative.
*The additive group of the real numbers {{nowrap|('''R''', +)}} acts on the set of real functions of a real variable in various ways, with (''t''⋅''f'')(''x'') equal to, e.g., {{nowrap|''f''(''x'' + ''t'')}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') + ''t''}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''xe&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'')}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''x'')''e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''x'' + ''t'')''e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, or {{nowrap|''f''(''xe&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'') + ''t''}}, but not {{nowrap|''f''(''xe&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' + ''t'')}}.
*Given a group action of ''G'' on ''X'', we can define an induced action of ''G'' on the [[power set]] of ''X'', by setting {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''U'' = {''g''⋅''u'' : ''u'' ∈ ''U''}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} for every subset ''U'' of ''X'' and every ''g'' in ''G''. This is useful, for instance, in studying the action of the large [[Mathieu group]] on a 24-set and in studying symmetry in certain models of [[finite geometry|finite geometries]].
* The [[quaternions]] with [[Norm of a quaternion|norm]] 1 (the [[versor]]s), as a multiplicative group, act on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: for any such quaternion {{nowrap|1=''z'' = cos ''α''/2 + '''v''' sin ''α''/2}}, the mapping {{nowrap|1=''f''('''x''') = ''z'''''x'''''z''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a counterclockwise rotation through an angle ''α'' about an axis given by a unit vector '''v'''; ''z'' is the same rotation; see [[quaternions and spatial rotation]].

== Group actions and groupoids ==
The notion of group action can be put in a broader context by using the ''action [[groupoid]]'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle G' \;=\;  G \,\ltimes\, X&lt;/math&gt;  associated to the group action, thus allowing techniques from groupoid theory such as presentations and [[fibration]]s. Further the stabilizers of the action are the vertex groups,  and the orbits of the action are the components, of the action groupoid. For more details, see the book ''Topology and groupoids'' referenced below.

This action groupoid comes with a morphism &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p:\; G' \,\rightarrow\, G&lt;/math&gt; which is a ''covering morphism of groupoids''. This allows a relation between such morphisms and [[covering maps]] in topology.

== Morphisms and isomorphisms between ''G''-sets ==
If ''X'' and ''Y'' are two ''G''-sets, we define a ''[[morphism]]'' from ''X'' to ''Y'' to be a function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f''(''g''⋅''x'') = ''g''⋅''f''(''x'')}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X''. Morphisms of ''G''-sets are also called ''[[equivariant map]]s'' or ''G-maps''.

The composition of two morphisms is again a morphism.

If a morphism ''f'' is [[bijective]], then its inverse is also a morphism, and we call ''f'' an ''[[isomorphism]]'' and the two ''G''-sets ''X'' and ''Y'' are called ''isomorphic''; for all practical purposes, they are indistinguishable in this case.

Some example isomorphisms:
* Every regular ''G'' action is isomorphic to the action of ''G'' on ''G'' given by left multiplication.
* Every free ''G'' action is isomorphic to {{nowrap|''G'' × ''S''}}, where ''S'' is some set and ''G'' acts on {{nowrap|''G'' × ''S''}} by left multiplication on the first coordinate. (''S'' can be taken to be the set of orbits ''X''/''G''.)
* Every transitive ''G'' action is isomorphic to left multiplication by ''G'' on the set of left [[coset]]s of some [[subgroup]] ''H'' of ''G''. (''H'' can be taken to be the stabilizer group of any element of the original ''G''-set.the original action.)

With this notion of morphism, the collection of all ''G''-sets forms a [[category theory|category]]; this category is a [[Grothendieck topos]] (in fact, assuming a classical metalogic, this topos will even be Boolean).

== Continuous group actions ==
{{main article|continuous group action}}

One often considers ''continuous group actions'': the group ''G'' is a [[topological group]], ''X'' is a [[topological space]], and the map {{nowrap|''G'' × ''X'' → ''X''}} is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] with respect to the [[product topology]] of {{nowrap|''G'' × ''X''}}. The space ''X'' is also called a ''G-space'' in this case. This is indeed a generalization, since every group can be considered a topological group by using the [[discrete space|discrete topology]]. All the concepts introduced above still work in this context, however we define morphisms between ''G''-spaces to be ''continuous'' maps compatible with the action of ''G''. The quotient ''X''/''G'' inherits the [[quotient topology]] from ''X'', and is called the ''quotient space'' of the action. The above statements about isomorphisms for regular, free and transitive actions are no longer valid for continuous group actions.

If ''X'' is a [[Covering map#Deck transformation group, regular covers|regular covering space]] of another topological space ''Y'', then the action of the [[Covering map#Deck transformation group, regular covers|deck transformation group]]  on ''X'' is properly discontinuous as well as being free. Every free, properly discontinuous action of a group ''G'' on a [[path-connected]] topological space ''X'' arises in this manner: the quotient map {{nowrap|''X'' ↦ ''X''/''G''}} is a regular covering map, and the deck transformation group is the given action of ''G'' on ''X''. Furthermore, if ''X'' is simply connected, the fundamental group of ''X''/''G'' will be isomorphic to ''G''.

These results  have been generalized in the book ''Topology and Groupoids'' referenced below to obtain the [[fundamental groupoid]] of the orbit space of a discontinuous action of a discrete group on a Hausdorff space, as,  under reasonable  local conditions, the orbit groupoid of the fundamental groupoid of the space. This allows calculations such as the fundamental group of the [[symmetric square]] of a space ''X'', namely the orbit space of the product of ''X'' with itself under the twist action of the cyclic group of order 2 sending {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} to {{nowrap|(''y'', ''x'')}}.

An action of a group ''G'' on a [[locally compact space]] ''X'' is ''cocompact'' if there exists a compact subset ''A'' of ''X'' such that {{nowrap|1=''GA'' = ''X''}}. For a properly discontinuous action, cocompactness is equivalent to compactness of the quotient space ''X/G''.

The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is said to be ''proper'' if the mapping {{nowrap|''G'' × ''X'' → ''X'' × ''X''}} that sends {{nowrap|(''g'', ''x'') ↦ (''g⋅x'', ''x'')}} is a [[proper map]].

===Strongly continuous group action and smooth points===
A group action of a topological group ''G'' on a topological space ''X'' is said to be ''strongly continuous'' if for all ''x'' in ''X'', the map {{nowrap|''g'' ↦ ''g''⋅''x''}} is continuous with respect to the respective topologies. Such an action induces an action on the space of continuous functions on ''X'' by defining {{nowrap|1=(''g''⋅''f'')(''x'') = ''f''(''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''x'')}} for every ''g'' in ''G'', ''f'' a continuous function on ''X'', and ''x'' in ''X''. Note that, while every continuous group action is strongly continuous, the converse is not in general true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The subspace of ''smooth points'' for the action is the subspace of ''X'' of points ''x'' such that {{nowrap|''g'' ↦ ''g''⋅''x''}} is smooth; i.e., it is continuous and all derivatives{{where|date=August 2013}} are continuous.

== Variants and generalizations ==
One can also consider actions of [[monoid]]s on sets, by using the same two axioms as above. This does not define bijective maps and equivalence relations however. See [[semigroup action]].

Instead of actions on sets, one can define actions of groups and monoids on objects of an arbitrary [[category theory|category]]: start with an object ''X'' of some category, and then define an action on ''X'' as a monoid homomorphism into the monoid of endomorphisms of ''X''. If ''X'' has an underlying set, then all definitions and facts stated above can be carried over. For example, if we take the category of [[vector space]]s, we obtain [[group representation]]s in this fashion.

One can view a group ''G'' as a category with a single object in which every [[morphism]] is invertible. A (left) group action is then nothing but a (covariant) [[functor]] from ''G'' to the [[category of sets]], and a group representation is a functor from ''G'' to the [[category of vector spaces]]. A morphism between G-sets is then a [[natural transformation]] between the group action functors.  In analogy, an action of a [[groupoid]] is a functor from the groupoid to the category of sets or to some other category.

In addition to [[continuous group action|continuous actions]] of topological groups on topological spaces, one also often considers [[Lie group action|smooth actions]] of [[Lie groups]] on [[manifold|smooth manifold]]s, regular actions of [[algebraic group]]s on [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], and [[group-scheme action|actions]] of [[group scheme]]s on [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. All of these are examples of [[group object]]s acting on objects of their respective category.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8923">In [[mathematics]], the notion of the [[continuous function|continuity]] of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] is not immediately extensible to [[multivalued function|multivalued mappings]] or [[correspondence (mathematics)|correspondences]] between two sets ''A'' and ''B''.  The dual concepts of '''upper hemicontinuity''' and '''lower hemicontinuity''' facilitate such an extension.  A correspondence that has both properties is said to be '''continuous''' in an analogy to the property of the same name for functions.

Roughly speaking, a function is upper hemicontinuous when (1) a convergent sequence of points in the domain maps to a sequence of sets in the range which (2) contain another convergent sequence, then the image of limiting point in the domain must contain the limit of the sequence in the range.  Lower hemicontinuity essentially reverses this, saying if a sequence in the domain converges, given a point in the range of the limit, then you can find a sub-sequence whose image contains a convergent sequence to the given point.

== Upper hemicontinuity ==
[[Image:Upper hemicontinuous.svg|thumb|right|An upper hemicontinuous correspondence that is not lower hemicontinuous. It is not lower hemicontinuous because for a sequence of points ''{x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}'' that converges to ''x'', we have a ''y'' (''y'' in ''f(x)'') such that no sequence of ''{y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}'' converges to ''y'' where each ''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is in ''f(x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;)''.]]
&lt;!-- Very dry, I realize, this needs to be said in text also, possibly with a graph. --&gt;

A correspondence &amp;Gamma; : ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' is said to be '''upper hemicontinuous''' at the point ''a'' if for any open neighbourhood ''V'' of &amp;Gamma;(''a'') there exists a neighbourhood ''U'' of ''a'' such that for all ''x'' in ''U'', &amp;Gamma;(''x'') is a subset of ''V''.

===Sequential characterization===

For a correspondence &amp;Gamma; : ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' with closed values, 
&amp;Gamma; :  ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' is upper hemicontinuous at &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\forall a_n \in A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\forall b \in B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\forall  b_n \in \Gamma(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = a,\; \lim_{n\to\infty} b_n = b \implies b \in \Gamma(a) &lt;/math&gt;
If &amp;Gamma; is compact-valued (i.e. &amp;Gamma;(''x'') is compact for all ''x'') the converse is also true.

===Closed Graph Theorem===
The graph of a correspondence &amp;Gamma; : ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' is the set defined by &lt;math&gt;Gr(\Gamma) = \{(a,b)\in A\times B : b\in\Gamma(a)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &amp;Gamma; : ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' is an upper hemicontinuous correspondence with closed domain (that is, the set of points ''a'' ∈ ''A'' where &amp;Gamma;(''a'') is not the empty set is closed) and closed values (i.e. &amp;Gamma;(''a'') is closed for all ''a'' in ''A''), then Gr(&amp;Gamma;) is closed. If ''B'' is compact, then the converse is also true.&lt;ref&gt;Proposition 1.4.8 of {{cite book |first=Jean-Pierre |last=Aubin |first2=Hélène |last2=Frankowska |author2-link= Hélène Frankowska |title=Set-Valued Analysis |publisher=Birkhäuser |location=Basel |year=1990 |isbn=3-7643-3478-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVUl3smcGlcC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lower hemicontinuity ==
[[Image:Lower hemicontinuous.svg|thumb|right|A lower hemicontinuous correspondence that is not upper hemicontinuous. It is not upper hemicontinuous because the graph (set) is not closed.]]
A correspondence &amp;Gamma; :  ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' is said to be '''lower hemicontinuous''' at the point ''a'' 
if for any open set ''V'' intersecting &amp;Gamma;(''a'') there exists a neighbourhood ''U'' of ''a'' such that &amp;Gamma;(''x'') intersects ''V'' for all ''x'' in ''U''. (Here ''V'' ''intersects'' ''S'' means nonempty intersection &lt;math&gt;V \cap S \neq\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;).

===Sequential characterization===
&amp;Gamma; :  ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' is lower hemicontinuous at ''a'' if and only if

:&lt;math&gt; \forall a_m \in A, \, a_m \rarr a, \forall b \in \Gamma(a), \exists a_{m_k}&lt;/math&gt; subsequence of &lt;math&gt;a_m, \, \exists b_k \in \Gamma(a_{m_k}), \, b_k \rarr b &lt;/math&gt;

===Open Graph Theorem===
A correspondence &amp;Gamma; :  ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' have ''open lower sections'' if the set &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^{-1}(b) =\{ a \in A : b \in \Gamma(a)\}&lt;/math&gt;
is open in ''A'' for every ''b'' ∈ ''B''. If &amp;Gamma; values are all open sets in ''B'', then &amp;Gamma; is said to have ''open upper sections''. 

If &amp;Gamma; has an open graph ''Gr''(&amp;Gamma;), then &amp;Gamma; has open upper and lower sections and if &amp;Gamma; has open lower sections then it is lower hemicontinuous.&lt;ref name="Zhou:95"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=J.X.|title=On the Existence of Equilibrium for Abstract Economies|journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications|date=August 1995|volume=193|issue=3|pages=839–858|doi=10.1006/jmaa.1995.1271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The open graph theorem says that if &amp;Gamma; : ''A'' &amp;rarr; P('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;) is a convex-valued correspondence with open upper sections, then &amp;Gamma; has an open graph in ''A'' × '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; if and only if &amp;Gamma; is lower hemicontinuous.&lt;ref name="Zhou:95" /&gt;

== Properties ==
Set-theoretic, algebraic and topological operations on multivalued maps (like union, composition, sum, convex hull, closure)
usually preserve the type of continuity. But this should be taken with appropriate care since, for example there exists a pair of lower hemicontinuous correspondences whose intersection is not lower hemicontinuous. This can be fixed upon strengthening continuity properties: if one of those lower hemicontinuous multifunctions has open graph then their intersection is again lower hemicontinuous.

Very important part of set-valued analysis (in view of applications) constitutes the investigation of single-valued [[choice function|selections]] and approximations to multivalued maps. Typically lower hemicontinuous correspondences admit single-valued selections ([[Michael selection theorem]], Bressan–Colombo directionally continuous selection theorem, Fryszkowski decomposable map selection), likewise upper hemicontinuous maps admit approximations (e.g. Ancel–Granas–Górniewicz–Kryszewski theorem).

== Implications for continuity ==
&lt;!-- Needs more elaboration and cleaning up --&gt;
If a correspondence is both upper hemicontinuous and lower hemicontinuous, it is said to be continuous. A continuous function is in all cases both upper and lower hemicontinuous.

== Other concepts of continuity ==
The upper and lower hemicontinuity might be viewed as usual continuity:

: &amp;Gamma; :  ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' is lower [resp. upper] hemicontinuous if and only if the mapping &amp;Gamma; : ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''P(B)'' is continuous where the [[Hyperspace (topology)|hyperspace]] ''P(B)'' has been endowed with the lower [resp. upper] Vietoris topology.

(For the notion of hyperspace compare also [[power set]] and [[function space]]).

Using lower and upper Hausdorff [[Uniform space|uniformity]] we can also define the so-called '''upper''' and '''lower semicontinuous maps in the sense of Hausdorff''' (also known as '''metrically lower / upper semicontinuous maps''').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2812">In [[mathematics]], '''Hodge–Arakelov theory''' of [[elliptic curve]]s is an analogue of classical and ''p''-adic [[Hodge theory]] for elliptic curves carried out in the framework of [[Arakelov theory]]. It was introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Mochizuki|authorlink=Shinichi Mochizuki|year=1999}}.

Mochizuki's main comparison  theorem in Hodge–Arakelov theory states (roughly) that the space of [[polynomial function]]s of degree less than ''d'' on the universal extension of a smooth elliptic curve in [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0 is naturally [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (via restriction) to the ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-dimensional space of functions on the ''d''-[[Torsion (algebra)|torsion points]]. It is called a comparison theorem as it is an analogue for Arakelov theory of comparison theorems in cohomology relating [[de Rham cohomology]] to [[singular cohomology]] of complex varieties or [[étale cohomology]] of ''p''-adic varieties.

In {{harvs|txt|last=Mochizuki|authorlink=Shinichi Mochizuki|year=1999}} and {{harvs|txt|last=Mochizuki|authorlink=Shinichi Mochizuki|year=2002a}} he pointed out that arithmetic Kodaira-Spencer map and [[Gauss–Manin connection]] may give some important hints for [[Vojta's conjecture]], [[ABC conjecture]] and so on.

      <comment>"Face validity," in which instrument users casually apprise whether an item appears to be measuring what it is meant to measure, is no longer considered to be a necessary, or in most cases even relevant, criterion in item development (e.g., DeVellis, 2017, Scale Development, 4th Edition, p. 100-102). This term lacks a clear definition and is dated.  I have suggested a replacement term "content validity" that is at least somewhat better defined and more contemporary than "face validity."</comment>

Much data in the field of social sciences is represented in various indices such as [[Gender Gap Index]], [[Human Development Index]] or the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]].

Item in indexes are usually weighted equally, unless there are some reasons against it (for example, if two items reflect essentially the same aspect of a variable, they could have a weight of 0.5 each).&lt;ref name="Babbie2012-170"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k-aza3qSULoC&amp;pg=PA170|title = The Practice of Social Research|date = 1 January 2012|publisher = Cengage Learning|isbn = 1-133-04979-6|page = 162|author = Earl Babbie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructing the items involves four steps. First, items should be selected based on their [[content validity]], [[unidimensionality]], the degree of [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] in which a dimension is to be measured, and their amount of [[variance]]. Items should be empirically related to one another, which leads to the second step of examining their multivariate relationships. Third, indexes scores are designed, which involves determining their score ranges and weights for the items. Finally, indexes should be validated, which involves testing whether they can predict indicators related to the measured variable not used in their construction.&lt;ref name="Babbie2012-185"&gt;{{cite book|author=Earl Babbie|title=The Practice of Social Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k-aza3qSULoC&amp;pg=PA185|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-133-04979-6|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infinitism''' is the view that knowledge may be justified by an infinite chain of reasons. It belongs to [[epistemology]], the branch of [[philosophy]] that considers the possibility, nature, and means of [[knowledge]].

==Epistemological infinitism==

Since [[Gettier problem|Gettier]], "knowledge" is no longer widely accepted as meaning "[[justified true belief]]" only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite SEP|url-id=knowledge-analysis|title=The Analysis of Knowledge|date=2017-03-17|edition=Fall 2017|last=Ichikawa|first=Jonathan Jenkins|last2=Steup|first2=Matthias}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some epistemologists{{who|date=March 2016}}  still consider knowledge to have a justification condition. Traditional theories of justification ([[foundationalism]] and [[coherentism]]) and indeed some philosophers{{who|date=March 2016}} consider an infinite regress not to be a valid justification. In their view, if ''A'' is justified by ''B'', ''B'' by ''C'', and so forth, then either 
# The chain must end with a link that requires no independent justification (a foundation), 
# The chain must come around in a circle in some finite number of steps (the belief may be justified by its coherence), or 
# Our beliefs must not be justified after all (as is posited by [[Philosophical skepticism|philosophical skeptics]]).

Infinitism, the view, for example, of [[Peter D. Klein]], challenges this consensus, referring back to work of [[Paul Moser]] (1984) and John Post (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/inf-epis/#H2|title = Infinitism in Epistemology|accessdate = 2015-06-19|website = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last = Klein|first = Peter D.|last2 = Turri|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the evidential ancestry of a justified belief must be infinite and non-repeating, which follows from the conjunction two principles that Klein sees as having straightforward intuitive appeal: "The Principle of Avoiding Circularity" and "The Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness."

The Principle of Avoiding Circularity (PAC) is stated as follows: "For all x, if a person, S, has a justification for x, then for all y, if y is in the evidential ancestry of x for S, then x is not in the evidential ancestry of y for S."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAC says that the proposition to be justified cannot be a member of its own evidential ancestry, which is violated by coherence theories of justification.

The Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness (PAA) is stated as follows: "For all x, if a person, S, has a justification for x, then there is some reason, r1, available to S for x; and there is some reason, r2, available to S for r1; etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAA says that in order to avoid arbitrariness, for any proposition ''x'' to be justified for an epistemological agent, there must be some reason ''r'' available to the agent; this reason will in turn require the same structure of justification, and so on ''ad infinitum''. Foundationalist theories can only avoid arbitrariness by claiming that some propositions are self-justified. But if a proposition is its own justification (e.g. coherentism), then it is a member of its own evidential ancestry, and the structure of justification is circular.

In this view, the conjunction of both PAC and PAA leaves infinitism as the only alternative to skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Availability of Reasons: Klein also relies on the notion of "availability". In other words, a reason must be available to the subject in order for it to be a candidate for justification. There are two conditions that need to be satisfied in order for a reason to be available: objectively and subjectively.

An objectively available reason is stated as follows: "a belief, r, is objectively available to S as a reason for p if '''(1)''' r has some sufficiently high probability and the conditional probability of p given r is sufficiently high; or '''(2)''' an impartial, informed observer would accept r as a reason for p; or '''(3)''' r would be accepted in the long run by an appropriately defined set of people; or '''(4)''' r is evident for S and r makes p evident for S; or '''(5)''' r accords with S's deepest epistemic commitments; or '''(6)''' r meets the appropriate conversational presuppositions; or '''(7)''' an intellectually virtuous person would advance r as a reason for p."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these conditions are sufficient to describe objectively available reasons and are compatible with infinitism. Klein concedes that, ultimately, the proper characterization of objectively available need be a member of this list, but, for the scope of Klein's defense of infinitism, he need not provide a fully developed account of objectively available reasons. Objective availability could be best understood, at least as a working definition, as an existing, truth-apt reason not dependant on the subject.

A subjectively available reason is stated as follows: "S must be able to call on r." (Subjectively available is comparatively straightforward compared to objectively available.) The subject must be able to evoke the reason in their own mind and use the reason in the process of justification. In essence, the reason must be "properly hooked up with S's own beliefs" in order to be subjectively available.

A reason that is both objectively and subjectively available to a subject is a candidate for justification according to infinitism (or, at least for Klein).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objection to Infinitism: Klein addresses an objection to infinitism.

The finite mind objection (attributed to John Williams): The human mind is finite and has a limited capacity. "It is impossible to consciously believe an infinite number of propositions (because to believe something takes some time) and it is impossible to "unconsciously believe"...an infinite number of propositions because the candidate beliefs are such that some of them "defeat human understanding."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is simply an impossibility that a subject has an infinite chain of reasons which justify their beliefs because the human mind is finite. Klein concedes that the human mind is finite and cannot contain an infinite number of reasons, but the infinitist, according to Klein, is not committed to a subject actually possessing infinite reasons. "The infinitist is not claiming that in any finite period of time...we can consciously entertain an infinite number of thoughts. It is rather that there are an infinite number of propositions such that each one of them would be consciously thought were the appropriate circumstances to arise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, an infinite chain of reasons need not be present in the mind in order for a belief to be justified rather it must merely be possible to provide an infinite chain of reasons. There will always be another reason to justify the preceding reason if the subject felt compelled to make the inquiry and had subjective access to that reason.

'''Jerome (Jerry) Ravetz''' is a philosopher of science.  He is best known for his books analysing scientific knowledge from a social and ethical perspective, focussing on issues of quality.  He is the co-author (with [[Silvio Funtowicz]]) of the [[NUSAP]] notational system and of [[Post-normal science]].  He is currently an Associate Fellow at the Institute for Science, Innovation and Society, [[University of Oxford]].

== Biography ==
Ravetz was born in [[Philadelphia]]; his grandfather was a Russian-Jewish immigrant and his father a truck driver and trade union organiser.  He attended [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]] and [[Swarthmore College]].  He came to England in 1950 on a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied for a Ph.D. in Pure Mathematics under the supervision of [[A.S. Besicovitch]]. In 1955 his passport was taken away, as part of the wave of [[McCarthyism]]; it was returned in 1958 and in 1961 he became a British citizen.  He taught mathematics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and then at [[Durham University]].  In 1957 he moved to [[Leeds University]] to join [[Stephen Toulmin]] in the establishment of a centre in the History and Philosophy of Science.  He stayed at Leeds, eventually becoming a Reader, until taking early retirement in 1983.  Since then he has been an independent scholar.

He has visited at [[Utrecht University]], [[Harvard|Harvard University]], the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], the [[University of California Santa Cruz|University of California, Santa Cruz]], [[Fudan University]] (Shanghai), the [[University of Texas at Dallas]], the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and the University of Luxembourg. Over the years he has worked closely with colleagues at the European Commission [[Joint Research Centre]], Ispra, Italy.

His earliest research, after mathematics, was in the history of the mathematical sciences, with books on Copernicus and Fourier.  In 1971, he published the influential book ''[[Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems]]''.  This went through several English language editions, plus German and Japanese translations, and was republished in 1996. This book raises issues of uncertainty and ethics in the social practice of science. It was an early attempt to recast the philosophy of science for the conditions of 'industrialised science' and to shift the philosophy of science from epistemology to the social and ethical aspects of science. In it he proposed a 'critical science' for a new version of the idealism that had characterised science in the pre-industrial age.

In the years around 1970 he was an active member of the [[British Society for Social Responsibility in Science]].

From 1973 to 1976 he was Executive Secretary of the [[Council for Science and Society]] in London, whose founder was the law reformer [[Paul Sieghart]].  He drafted its report on 'The Acceptability of Risks'.  From 1977 to 1978, he was a member of the [[Genetic Manipulation Advisory Group]], regulating research in [[recombinant DNA]].
With [[Silvio Funtowicz]] he created the [[NUSAP]] notational system, described in their book [[Uncertainty and quality in science for policy]] (Reidel 1990). This was the stimulus for the development of the 'Guidance' for managing uncertainty, at the Netherlands Environment Agency.&lt;ref name="Guidance"&gt;A.C. Petersen, P.H.M. Janssen, J.P. van der Sluijs, J.S. Risbey, J.R. Ravetz, J.A. Wardekker, H. Martinson Hughes, Guidance for Uncertainty Assessment and Communication, 2nd Edition, PBL, 2013. 
&lt;/ref&gt; They also created the theory of [[Post-normal science]], which applies when 'Facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent.'&lt;ref name="PNS1"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. and Ravetz, J. R., 1991. "A New Scientific Methodology for Global Environmental Issues", in Costanza, R. (ed.), Ecological Economics: The Science and Management of Sustainability: 137–152.

With Zia Sardar he co-authored Cyberfutures: Culture and Politics on the Information Superhighway in 1996.[2] His most recent book is The [[No nonsense guide to science]] (New Internationalist 2006).
His research continues in two main directions:   new trends in the social practice of science; and new approaches to the management of uncertainty.  On the former, he has co-authored (with [[Silvio Funtowicz]]) chapters on 'Science, New Forms of'  and 'Peer Review and Quality Control' for the International Encyclopedia of Social and Behavioral Sciences (2015).&lt;ref name="PRQC"&gt;Funtowicz, S. and Ravetz, J.

D., (ed.), International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, 2nd edition, Vol. 21: 248–254. Oxford: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the latter he is concerned with the analysis of ignorance and the representation and manipulation of quantitative information where there is 'not even one significant digit'. He has also recently written 
on the quality control crisis of science.&lt;ref name="Benessia"&gt;Benessia, A., Funtowicz, S., Giampietro, M., Guimarães Pereira, A., Ravetz, J., Saltelli, A., Strand, R., van der Sluijs, J., 2016.

He is currently an Associate Fellow at the Institute for Science, Innovation and Society at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was interviewed by the [[Great Transition]] Initiative's [http://www.greattransition.org/publication/democratizing-science blog] on June 2016.

'''John Hopkinson,''' FRS, (27 July 1849 – 27 August 1898) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physicist]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and President of the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE (now the IET)]] twice in 1890 and 1896. He invented the three-wire ([[three-phase]]) system for the distribution of electrical power, for which he was granted a [[patent]] in 1882. He also worked in many areas of [[electromagnetism]] and [[electrostatics]], and in 1890 was appointed professor of [[electrical engineering]] at [[King's College London]], where he was also director of the [[Siemens Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]: ''Hopkinson, John'' by T. H. Beare&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Hopkinson's law]], the magnetic counterpart to [[Ohm's law]], is named after him.

==Life and career==
John Hopkinson was born in [[Manchester]], the eldest of 5 children. His father, also called John, was a [[mechanical engineer]]. He was educated at [[Queenwood College|Queenwood School]] in [[Hampshire]] and [[Owens College]] in Manchester. He won a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1867 and graduated in 1871 as [[Senior Wrangler]], having placed first in the demanding [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]] examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=HPKN867J|name=Hopkinson, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he also studied for and passed the examination for a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] from the [[University of London]]. Hopkinson could have followed a purely academic career but instead chose engineering as his vocation. He was a [[Cambridge Apostle]].

After working first in his father's engineering works, Hopkinson took a position in 1872 as an engineering manager in the [[lighthouse]] engineering department of [[Chance Brothers|Chance Brothers and Company]] in [[Smethwick]]. In 1877 Hopkinson was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in recognition of his application of [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of [[electromagnetism]] to problems of [[electrostatic]] capacity and residual charge. In 1878 he moved to [[London]] to work as a consulting engineer, focusing particularly on developing his ideas about how to improve the design and efficiency of [[dynamo]]s. Hopkinson's most important contribution was his three-wire distribution system, patented in 1882. In 1883 Hopkinson showed mathematically that it was possible to connect two alternating current dynamos in parallel-—a problem that had long bedevilled electrical engineers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/originalpaperson00hopkrich Original papers on dynamo machinery and allied subjects (London, Whittaker, 1893)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5300514 THE THEORY OF ALTERNATING CURRENTS, PARTICULARLY
IN REFERENCE TO TWO ALTERNATECURRENT
MACHINES CONNECTED TO THE SAME
CIRCUIT.*&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied magnetic permeability at high temperature, and discovered what was later called the [[Hopkinson effect|Hopkinson peak effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Magnetic and Other Physical Properties of Iron at a High Temperature | author = Hopkinson, J. | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A | volume = 180 | year = 1889 | pages = 443–465 | jstor = 90545| bibcode = 1889RSPTA.180..443H | doi = 10.1098/rsta.1889.0014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Series-parallel control|series-parallel method of electric motor control]], for which Hopkinson was granted a British patent in 1881, would prove to be an important advance in the development of electric railways.&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain Patent 2989 of 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; He applied for a US patent in 1892, triggering an [[interference proceeding]] against American inventor [[Rudolph M. Hunter|Rudolph M Hunter]], who had been granted a US patent for the method in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=385055&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;homeurl=http%3A%252F%252Fpatft.uspto.gov%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fpatimg.htm US Patent 385,055.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|US Patent Office]] affirmed Hopkinson’s claim to priority of invention, but his British patent expired before the case was resolved, rendering him ineligible for a US patent (his US patent, had one been issued, would have expired concurrently with his British patent).&lt;ref&gt;''Hopkinson v.

Hopkinson twice held the office of President of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. During his second term, Hopkinson proposed that the Institution should make available the technical knowledge of electrical engineers for the defence of the country. In 1897 the Volunteer Corps of Electrical Engineers was formed and Hopkinson became major in command of the corps.

==Personal life and legacy==
[[File:Memorial to John Hopkinson, Free School Lane - geograph.org.uk - 699093.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque at Cambridge]]
On 27 August 1898, Hopkinson and three of his six children, John Gustave, Alice and Lina Evelyn, were killed in a mountaineering accident on the [[Petite Dent de Veisivi]], [[Val d'Hérens]], in the [[Pennine Alps]], [[Switzerland]].

As a memorial to John Hopkinson and his son, the 1899 extension to the Engineering Laboratory in the [[New Museums Site]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] was named after him. A plaque commemorating this is fixed to the wall in [[Free School Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/bioelectrochemistry/hopkinson.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+16:35:41 John Hopkinson biography]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hopkinson and Imperial Chemical Industries Professor of Applied Thermodynamics|Hopkinson and Imperial Chemical Industries Professorship of Applied Thermodynamics]] is named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/1950-1975/prof_thermo.html Cambridge University - 125 Years of Engineering Excellence]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a memorial sundial to Alice Hopkinson in the gardens of Newnham College, Cambridge from which she had recently graduated; the Lina Evelyn Hopkinson Scholarship is awarded to pupils at [[Wimbledon High School]] for English Literature.

At the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] the Electro-technical Laboratory (1912) in Coupland Street was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Manchester and Salford''. Manchester: George Falkner &amp; Sons, 1929; p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

His sons [[Bertram Hopkinson|Bertram]] and Cecil, wife Evelyn and daughter Ellen (married [[James Alfred Ewing]] in 1912) are buried in the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge]]; the rest of the family are interred in [[Switzerland]].

'''''Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] covering [[algebraic combinatorics]]. It is published by [[Springer Science+Business Media]] and was established in 1992. The editor-in-chief is Ilias S. Kotsireas ([[Wilfrid Laurier University]]).

In 2017, the journal's four [[editors-in-chief]] and [[editorial board]] resigned to protest the publisher's high prices and limited accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/07/31/math-journal-editors-resign-start-rival-open-access-journal |title=Math Journal Editors Quit for Open Access|author=Lindsay McKenzie|publisher=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=2017-07-31 |access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://gowers.wordpress.com/2017/07/27/another-journal-flips/ |title=Another journal flips |last=Gowers |first=Tim |date=2017-07-27 |work=Gowers's Weblog |access-date=2018-02-07 |author-link=Timothy Gowers}}&lt;/ref&gt; They criticized Springer for "double-dipping", that is, charging large subscription fees to libraries in addition to high fees for authors who wished to make their publications open access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2017/08/15/scholarly-communications-shouldnt-just-be-open-but-non-profit-too/ |title=Scholarly communications shouldn’t just be open, but non-profit too |last=Pooley |first=Jefferson |date=2017-08-15 |work=Impact of Social Sciences |access-date=2018-02-08 |publisher=[[London School of Economics and Political Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board subsequently started their own [[open access journal]], ''Algebraic Combinatorics''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McKenzie |first1=Lindsay |title=Math Journal Editors Quit for Open Access |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/07/31/math-journal-editors-resign-start-rival-open-access-journal |website=[[Inside Higher Ed]]|accessdate=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is published with the help of MathOA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Journal of algebraic combinatorics flips to fair OA|access-date=2018-03-16|url=http://www.mathoa.org/journal-of-algebraic-combinatorics-flips-to-fair-oa/}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Centre Mersenne]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1187">'''Keysigning''' refers to [[digital signature|digitally signing]] someone else's [[public key]] using your own.
A more correct term would be '''[[digital certificate|certificate]] signing''', since the actual key material is not changed by the process of signing. However, in the [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] community it is customary not to distinguish in speaking between someone's key and certificate, and the term '''keysigning''' is used. (The term PGP refers here to all implementations of the [[OpenPGP]] standard, such as [[GnuPG]].)

Users of PGP sign one another's keys to indicate to any third party that the signer trusts the signee. This enables someone who trusts the signer to extend her trust to the signee as well. In this way, a [[web of trust]] is built.

PGP users often organize [[key signing party|key signing parties]], where many people meet in person to verify each other's identity using some printed certificate of identity and then sign each other's keys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3792">In mathematics, '''Krener's theorem''' is a result attributed to [[Arthur J. Krener]] in geometric [[control theory]] about the topological properties of [[attainable set]]s of finite-dimensional control systems.  It states that any attainable set of a [[bracket-generating]] system has nonempty interior or, equivalently, that any attainable set has nonempty interior in the topology of the corresponding [[orbit (control theory)|orbit]]. Heuristically, Krener's theorem prohibits attainable sets from being [[hairy ball theorem|hairy]].

==Theorem==
Let 
&lt;math&gt;{\ }\dot q=f(q,u)&lt;/math&gt; 
be a smooth control system, where 
&lt;math&gt;{\ q}&lt;/math&gt; 
belongs to a &lt;!-- &lt;math&gt;\ n&lt;/math&gt;- --&gt;finite-dimensional manifold &lt;math&gt;\ M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ u&lt;/math&gt; belongs to a control set &lt;math&gt;\ U&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the family  of vector fields &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal F}=\{f(\cdot,u)\mid u\in U\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\ \mathrm{Lie}\,\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Lie algebra]] generated by &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal F}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the [[Lie bracket of vector fields]]. 
Given &lt;math&gt;\ q\in M&lt;/math&gt;, if the vector space &lt;math&gt;\ \mathrm{Lie}_q\,\mathcal{F}=\{g(q)\mid g\in \mathrm{Lie}\,\mathcal{F}\}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\ T_q M&lt;/math&gt;,
then &lt;math&gt;\ q&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the closure of the interior of the attainable set from &lt;math&gt;\ q&lt;/math&gt;.

==Remarks and consequences==
Even if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Lie}_q\,\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is different from &lt;math&gt;\ T_q M&lt;/math&gt;,
the attainable set from &lt;math&gt;\ q&lt;/math&gt; has nonempty interior in the orbit topology,
as it follows from Krener's theorem applied to the control system restricted to the orbit through &lt;math&gt;\ q&lt;/math&gt;.

When all the vector fields in &lt;math&gt;\ \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; are analytic,  &lt;math&gt;\ \mathrm{Lie}_q\,\mathcal{F}=T_q M&lt;/math&gt; '''if and only if''' &lt;math&gt;\ q&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the closure of the interior of the attainable set from &lt;math&gt;\ q&lt;/math&gt;. This is a consequence of Krener's theorem and of the [[orbit (control theory)#Orbit theorem (Nagano-Sussmann)|orbit theorem]].

As a corollary of Krener's theorem one can prove that if the system is bracket-generating and if the attainable set from &lt;math&gt;\ q\in M&lt;/math&gt; is dense in &lt;math&gt;\ M&lt;/math&gt;, then the attainable set from &lt;math&gt;\ q&lt;/math&gt;
is actually equal to &lt;math&gt;\ M&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3961">'''Larisa Lvovna Maksimova''' ({{lang-ru|Лариса Львовна Максимова}}, born 1943) is a Russian [[mathematical logic]]ian known for her research in [[non-classical logic]].

==Education and career==
Maksimova was born on November 5, 1943, near [[Novosibirsk]], the daughter of two biologists who had temporarily moved there from [[Tomsk State University]] to escape the war. She grew up in Novosibirsk, where her parents became geographers at the Novosibirsk Pedagogical Institute. She studied mechanics and mathematics at [[Novosibirsk State University]], publishing her first paper on [[Wilhelm Ackermann]]'s axioms for [[strict implication]] in [[relevance logic]] in 1964 and graduating in 1965.{{r|autobio}}

Meanwhile, in 1964, she joined the [[Sobolev Institute of Mathematics]], and has remained there for the rest of her career. She defended her doctorate at Novosibirsk State University in 1968, a year after the death of her primary mentor at the university, [[Anatoly Maltsev]]. She completed a [[habilitation]] at the Sobolev Institute in 1986, and was promoted to full professor in 1993.{{r|autobio}}

==Contributions==
Maksimova's books include
*''Problems in Set Theory, Mathematical Logic and the Theory of Algorithms'' (with Igor Lavrov, Izdat Nauka, 1975, 1984, and 1995; translated into English by Valentin Shehtman, Kluwer, 2003){{r|pst}}
*''Interpolation and Definability: Modal and Intuitionistic Logics'' (with [[Dov Gabbay]], Clarendon Press, 2005){{r|id}}

==Recognition==
Maksimova won the Maltsev Prize of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 2009, for her papers on [[Beth definability|definability]] and [[Craig interpolation|interpolation]] in [[non-classical logic]].{{r|mp}}
With several others from the Sobolev Institute, she won the Russian Federation Government Prize in Education in 2010.{{r|si}}
She is the subject of a [[festschrift]], ''Larisa Maksimova on Implication, Interpolation, and Definability'' (Sergei Odintsov, ed., Springer, 2018).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10759">{{Redirect|Signal masking||Masking (disambiguation)}}

In [[computer science]], a '''mask''' is data that is used for [[bitwise operation]]s, particularly in a [[bit field]]. Using a mask, multiple bits in a [[byte]], [[nibble]], [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] etc. can be set either on, off or inverted from on to off (or vice versa) in a single bitwise operation.

==Common bitmask functions==

===Masking bits to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;===
To turn certain bits on, the [[Logical disjunction|bitwise &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;]] operation can be used, following [[Logical disjunction#Bitwise operation|the principle]] that &lt;code&gt;Y OR 1 = 1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Y OR 0 = Y&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, to make sure a bit is on, &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt; can be used with a &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. To leave a bit unchanged, &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt; is used with a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.

Example: Masking ''on'' the higher [[nibble]] (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. 
     '''1001'''0101   '''1010'''0101
  OR '''1111'''0000   '''1111'''0000
   = '''1111'''0101   '''1111'''0101

===Masking bits to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;===
More often in practice bits are "masked ''off''" (or masked to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;) than "masked ''on''" (or masked to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;). When a bit is &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;ed with a 0, the result is always 0, i.e. &lt;code&gt;Y AND 0 = 0&lt;/code&gt;. To leave the other bits as they were originally, they can be &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;ed with &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, since &lt;code&gt;Y AND 1 = Y&lt;/code&gt;.

Example: Masking ''off'' the higher [[nibble]] (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. 
     '''1001'''0101   '''1010'''0101
 AND '''0000'''1111   '''0000'''1111
   = '''0000'''0101   '''0000'''0101

===Querying the status of a bit===
It is possible to use bitmasks to easily check the state of individual bits regardless of the other bits. To do this, turning off all the other bits using the bitwise &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt; is done as discussed [[#Masking bits to 0|above]] and the value is compared with &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. If it is equal to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, then the bit was off, but if the value is any other value, then the bit was on. What makes this convenient is that it is not necessary to figure out what the value actually is, just that it is not &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.

Example: Querying the status of the 4th bit
     1001'''1'''101   1001'''0'''101
 AND 0000'''1'''000   0000'''1'''000
   = 0000'''1'''000   0000'''0'''000

===Toggling bit values===
So far the article has covered how to turn bits on and turn bits off, but not both at once. Sometimes it does not really matter what the value is, but it must be made the opposite of what it currently is. This can be achieved using the [[Exclusive or|&lt;code&gt;XOR&lt;/code&gt; (exclusive or)]] operation. &lt;code&gt;XOR&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; [[if and only if]] an [[odd number]] of bits are &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, if two corresponding bits are &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, the result will be a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, but if only one of them is &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, the result will be &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore inversion of the values of bits is done by &lt;code&gt;XOR&lt;/code&gt;ing them with a &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. If the original bit was &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, it returns &lt;code&gt;1 XOR 1 = 0&lt;/code&gt;. If the original bit was &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; it returns &lt;code&gt;0 XOR 1 = 1&lt;/code&gt;. Also note that &lt;code&gt;XOR&lt;/code&gt; masking is bit-safe, meaning that it will not affect unmasked bits because &lt;code&gt;Y XOR 0 = Y&lt;/code&gt;, just like an &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;.

Example: Toggling bit values
     10011101   10010101
 XOR '''00001111   11111111'''
   = 10010010   01101010

To write arbitrary 1s and 0s to a subset of bits, first write 0s to that subset, then set the high bits:

   register = (register &amp; ~bitmask) | value;

==Uses of bitmasks==

=== Arguments to functions ===
In programming languages such as [[C (language)|C]], bit fields are a useful way to pass a set of named boolean arguments to a function. For example, in the graphics API [[OpenGL]], there is a command, &lt;code&gt;glClear()&lt;/code&gt; which clears the screen or other buffers. It can clear up to four buffers (the color, depth, accumulation, and stencil buffers), so the API authors could have had it take four arguments. But then a call to it would look like
&lt;source lang="c"&gt; glClear(1,1,0,0); // This is not how glClear actually works and would make for unstable code.&lt;/source&gt;
which is not very descriptive. Instead there are four defined field bits, &lt;code&gt;GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;glClear()&lt;/code&gt; is declared as
&lt;source lang="c"&gt; void glClear(GLbitfield bits);&lt;/source&gt;
Then a call to the function looks like this
&lt;source lang="c"&gt; glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);&lt;/source&gt;
Internally, a function taking a bitfield like this can use binary &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; to extract the individual bits. For example, an implementation of &lt;code&gt;glClear()&lt;/code&gt; might look like:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
void glClear(GLbitfield bits) {
  if ((bits &amp; GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {
    // Clear color buffer.
  }
  if ((bits &amp; GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {
    // Clear depth buffer.
  }
  if ((bits &amp; GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {
    // Clear accumulation buffer.
  }
  if ((bits &amp; GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {
    // Clear stencil buffer.
  }
}&lt;/source&gt;
The advantage to this approach is that function argument overhead is decreased. Since the minimum datum size is one byte, separating the options into separate arguments would be wasting seven bits per argument and would occupy more stack space. Instead, functions typically accept one or more 32-bit integers, with up to 32 option bits in each. While elegant, in the simplest implementation this solution is not [[type safety|type-safe]]. A &lt;code&gt;GLbitfield&lt;/code&gt; is simply defined to be an &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt;, so the compiler would allow a meaningless call to &lt;code&gt;glClear(42)&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;glClear(GL_POINTS)&lt;/code&gt;. In [[C++]] an alternative would be to create a class to encapsulate the set of arguments that glClear could accept and could be cleanly encapsulated in a library (see the external links for an example).

===Inverse masks===
Masks are used with IP addresses in IP ACLs (Access Control Lists) to specify what should be permitted and denied. To configure IP addresses on interfaces, masks start with 255 and have the large values on the left side: for example, IP address 209.165.202.129 with a 255.255.255.224 mask. Masks for IP ACLs are the reverse: for example, mask 0.0.0.255. This is sometimes called an inverse mask or a [[wildcard mask]]. When the value of the mask is broken down into binary (0s and 1s), the results determine which address bits are to be considered in processing the traffic. A 0 indicates that the address bits must be considered (exact match); a 1 in the mask is a "don't care". This table further explains the concept.

Mask example:

network address (traffic that is to be processed) 	
10.1.1.0

mask	
0.0.0.255

network address (binary)	
00001010.00000001.00000001.00000000

mask (binary)	
00000000.00000000.00000000.11111111

Based on the binary mask, it can be seen that the first three sets ([[Octet (computing)|octets]]) must match the given binary network address exactly (00001010.00000001.00000001). The last set of numbers is made of "don't cares" (.11111111). Therefore, all traffic that begins with 10.1.1. matches since the last octet is "don't care". Therefore, with this mask, network addresses 10.1.1.1 through 10.1.1.255 (10.1.1.x) are processed.

Subtract the normal mask from 255.255.255.255 in order to determine the ACL inverse mask. In this example, the inverse mask is determined for network address 172.16.1.0 with a normal mask of 255.255.255.0.

255.255.255.255 - 255.255.255.0 (normal mask) = 0.0.0.255 (inverse mask)

ACL equivalents

The source/source-wildcard of 0.0.0.0/255.255.255.255 means "any".

The source/wildcard of 10.1.1.2/0.0.0.0 is the same as "host 10.1.1.2"

===Image masks===
{{see also|Bit blit|Clipping path}}
[[Image:Blit dot.gif|thumb|[[Raster graphics|Raster graphic]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s (left) and masks (right)]]
In [[computer graphics]], when a given image is intended to be placed over a background, the transparent areas can be specified through a binary mask. This way, for each intended image there are actually two [[bitmap]]s: the actual image, in which the  unused areas are given a [[pixel]] value with all [[bit]]s set to 0s, and an additional ''mask'', in which the correspondent image areas are given a pixel value of all bits set to 0s and the surrounding areas a value of all bits set to 1s. In the sample at right, black pixels have the all-zero bits and white pixels have the all-one bits.

At [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], to put the image on the screen over the background, the program first masks the screen pixel's bits with the image mask at the desired coordinates using the [[bitwise AND]] operation. This preserves the background pixels of the transparent areas while resets with zeros the bits of the pixels which will be obscured by the overlapped image.

Then, the program renders the image pixel's bits by combining them with the background pixel's bits using the [[Logical disjunction|bitwise OR]] operation. This way, the image pixels are appropriately placed while keeping the background surrounding pixels preserved. The result is a perfect compound of the image over the background.

[[Image:Sprite rendering by binary image mask.png|center]]

This technique is used for painting pointing device cursors, in typical 2-D videogames for characters, bullets and so on (the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s), for [[GUI]] [[Icon (computing)|icon]]s, and for video titling and other image mixing applications.

Although related (due to being used for the same purposes), [[Palette (computing)#Transparent color in palettes|transparent color]]s and [[alpha channel]]s are techniques which do not involve the image pixel mixage by binary masking.

===Hash tables===
To create a hashing function for a [[hash table]], often a function is used that has a large domain. To create an index from the output of the function, a modulo can be taken to reduce the size of the domain to match the size of the array; however, it is often faster on many processors to restrict the size of the hash table to powers of two sizes and use a bitmask instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7696">The '''minimum-cost flow problem''' ('''MCFP''') is an [[optimization]] and [[decision problem]] to find the cheapest possible way of sending a certain amount of flow through a [[flow network]]. A typical application of this problem involves finding the best delivery route from a factory to a warehouse where the road network has some capacity and cost associated. The minimum cost flow problem is one of the most fundamental among all flow and circulation problems because most other such problems can be cast as a minimum cost flow problem and also that it can be solved very efficiently using the [[network simplex algorithm]].

== Definition ==

A flow network is a [[directed graph]] &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; with a source vertex &lt;math&gt;s \in V&lt;/math&gt; and a sink vertex &lt;math&gt;t \in V&lt;/math&gt;, where each edge &lt;math&gt;(u,v) \in E&lt;/math&gt; has capacity &lt;math&gt;c(u,v) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, flow &lt;math&gt;f(u,v) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; and cost &lt;math&gt;a(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;, with most minimum-cost flow algorithms supporting edges with negative costs. The cost of sending this flow along an edge &lt;math&gt;(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f(u,v)\cdot a(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;. The problem requires an amount of flow &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; to be sent from source &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to sink &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

The definition of the problem is to minimize the '''total cost''' of the flow over all edges:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{(u,v) \in E} a(u,v) \cdot f(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;

with the constraints
:{|
|-
| '''Capacity constraints''': || &lt;math&gt;\,f(u,v) \le c(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| '''Skew symmetry''': || &lt;math&gt;\,f(u,v) = - f(v,u)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| '''Flow conservation''': || &lt;math&gt;\,\sum_{w \in V} f(u,w) = 0 \text{ for all } u \neq s, t&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| '''Required flow''': || &lt;math&gt;\,\sum_{w \in V} f(s,w) = d \text{ and } \sum_{w \in V} f(w,t) = d&lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Relation to other problems ==

A variation of this problem is to find a flow which is maximum, but has the lowest cost among the maximum flow solutions. This could be called a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem and is useful for finding minimum cost maximum [[Matching (graph theory)|matching]]s.

With some solutions, finding the minimum cost maximum flow instead is straightforward. If not, one can find the maximum flow by performing a [[binary search]] on &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

A related problem is the [[minimum cost circulation problem]], which can be used for solving minimum cost flow. This is achieved by setting the lower bound on all edges to zero, and then making an extra edge from the sink &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to the source &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, with capacity &lt;math&gt;c(t,s)=d&lt;/math&gt; and lower bound &lt;math&gt;l(t,s)=d&lt;/math&gt;, forcing the total flow from &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to also be &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

The problem can be specialized into two other problems：
* if the capacity constraint is removed, the problem is reduced to the [[shortest path problem]],
* if the costs are all set equal to zero, the problem is reduced to the [[maximum flow problem]].

== Solutions ==

The minimum cost flow problem can be solved by [[linear programming]], since we optimize a linear function, and all constraints are linear.

Apart from that, many combinatorial algorithms exist, for a comprehensive survey, see {{ref|AMO93}}. Some of them are generalizations of [[maximum flow|maximum flow algorithms]], others use entirely different approaches.

Well-known fundamental algorithms (they have many variations):

* ''Cycle canceling'': a general primal method.{{ref|K67}}
* ''Minimum mean cycle canceling'': a simple [[strongly polynomial]] algorithm.{{ref|GT89}}
* ''Successive shortest path'' and ''capacity scaling'': dual methods, which can be viewed as the generalizations of the [[Ford–Fulkerson algorithm]].{{ref|EK72}}
* ''Cost scaling'': a primal-dual approach, which can be viewed as the generalization of the [[push-relabel algorithm]].{{ref|GT90}}
* ''[[Network simplex algorithm]]'': a specialized version of the [[linear programming]] [[simplex method]].{{ref|O97}}
* ''[[Out-of-kilter algorithm]]'' by [[D. R. Fulkerson]]

== Application ==

=== Minimum weight bipartite matching ===
[[File:Minimum weight bipartite matching.pdf|thumb|Reducing Minimum weight bipartite matching to minimum cost max flow problem]]
Given a [[bipartite graph]] ''G'' = (''A'' ∪ ''B'', ''E''), the goal is to find the maximum cardinality matching in ''G'' that has minimum cost. Let ''w'': ''E'' → ''R'' be a weight function on the edges of ''E''. The minimum weight bipartite matching problem or assignment problem is to find a 
perfect matching ''M'' ⊆ ''E'' whose total weight is minimized. The idea is to reduce this problem to a network flow problem.

Let ''G’'' = (''V’'' = ''A'' ∪ ''B'', ''E’'' = ''E''). Assign the capacity of all the edges in ''E’'' to 1. Add a source vertex ''s'' and connect it to all the vertices in ''A’'' and add a sink 
vertex ''t'' and connect all vertices inside group ''B’'' to this vertex. The capacity of all the new edges is 1 and their costs is 0. It is proved that there is minimum weight perfect bipartite matching in ''G'' if and only if there a minimum cost flow in ''G’''. {{ref|AMO93}}{{Dead link|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6935">In [[mathematics]], there are many senses in which a sequence or a series is said to be convergent.  This article describes various modes (senses or species) of convergence in the settings where they are defined.  For a list of '''modes of convergence''', see [[Modes of convergence (annotated index)]]

Note that each of the following objects is a special case of the types preceding it: [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[topological spaces]], [[uniform spaces]], [[topological abelian group|TAGs]] (topological abelian groups), [[Normed vector space|normed spaces]], [[Euclidean spaces]], and the real/complex numbers. Also, note that any [[metric space]] is a uniform space.

==Elements of a topological space==
Convergence can be defined in terms of [[Limit of a sequence|sequences]] in [[first-countable space]]s. [[Net (mathematics)|Net]]s are a generalization of sequences that is useful in spaces which are not first countable. [[Filter (mathematics)|Filter]]s further generalize the concept of convergence.

In metric spaces, one can define [[Cauchy sequence]]s. Cauchy nets and filters are generalizations to [[uniform space]]s. Even more generally, [[Cauchy space]]s are spaces in which Cauchy filters may be defined. Convergence implies "Cauchy-convergence", and Cauchy-convergence, together with the existence of a convergent subsequence implies convergence. The concept of [[complete metric space|completeness]] of metric spaces, and its generalizations is defined in terms of Cauchy sequences.

==Series of elements in a topological abelian group==
In a [[topological abelian group]], convergence of a [[series (mathematics)|series]] is defined as convergence of the sequence of partial sums. An important concept when considering series is [[unconditional convergence]], which guarantees that the limit of the series is invariant under permutations of the summands.

In a normed vector space, one can define [[absolute convergence]] as convergence of the series of norms (&lt;math&gt;\Sigma|b_k|&lt;/math&gt;). Absolute convergence implies Cauchy convergence of the sequence of partial sums (by the triangle inequality), which in turn implies absolute-convergence of some grouping (not reordering). The sequence of partial sums obtained by grouping is a subsequence of the partial sums of the original series. The norm convergence of absolutely convergent series is an equivalent condition for a normed linear space to be [[Banach space|Banach]] (i.e.: complete).

Absolute convergence and convergence together imply unconditional convergence, but unconditional convergence does not imply absolute convergence in general, even if the space is Banach, although the implication holds in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;.

==Convergence of sequence of functions on a topological space==
The most basic type of convergence for a sequence of functions (in particular, it does not assume any topological structure on the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the functions) is [[pointwise convergence]]. It is defined as convergence of the sequence of values of the functions at every point. If the functions take their values in a uniform space, then one can define pointwise Cauchy convergence, [[uniform convergence]], and [[uniformly Cauchy sequence|uniform Cauchy convergence]] of the sequence.

Pointwise convergence implies pointwise Cauchy-convergence, and the converse holds if the space in which the functions take their values is complete. Uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence and uniform Cauchy convergence. Uniform Cauchy convergence and pointwise convergence of a subsequence imply uniform convergence of the sequence, and if the codomain is complete, then uniform Cauchy convergence implies uniform convergence.

If the domain of the functions is a topological space, [[local uniform convergence]] (i.e. uniform convergence on a neighborhood of each point) and [[compact convergence|compact (uniform) convergence]] (i.e. uniform convergence on all [[compact subset]]s) may be defined. Note that "compact convergence" is always short for "compact uniform convergence," since "compact pointwise convergence" would mean the same thing as "pointwise convergence" (points are always compact).

Uniform convergence implies both local uniform convergence and compact convergence, since both are local notions while uniform convergence is global. If ''X'' is [[locally compact]] (even in the weakest sense: every point has compact neighborhood), then local uniform convergence is equivalent to compact (uniform) convergence.  Roughly speaking, this is because "local" and "compact" connote the same thing.

==Series of functions on a topological abelian group==
Pointwise and uniform convergence of series of functions are defined in terms of convergence of the sequence of partial sums.

For functions taking values in a [[normed linear space]], absolute convergence refers to convergence of the series of positive, real-valued functions &lt;math&gt;\Sigma|g_k|&lt;/math&gt; . "Pointwise absolute convergence" is then simply pointwise convergence of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma|g_k|&lt;/math&gt;.
 
[[Normal convergence]]&lt;sup&gt;[http://eom.springer.de/N/n067430.htm]&lt;/sup&gt; is convergence of the series of non-negative real numbers obtained by taking the [[uniform norm|uniform (i.e. "sup") norm]] of each function in the series (uniform convergence of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma|g_k|&lt;/math&gt;). In [[Banach space]]s, pointwise absolute convergence implies pointwise convergence, and normal convergence implies uniform convergence.

For functions defined on a topological space, one can define (as above) [[local uniform convergence]] and [[compact convergence|compact (uniform) convergence]] in terms of the partial sums of the series. If, in addition, the functions take values in a normed linear space, then [[Normal convergence#Local normal convergence|local normal convergence]] (local, uniform, absolute convergence) and [[Normal convergence#Compact normal convergence|compact normal convergence]] (absolute convergence on [[compact set]]s) can be defined.

Normal convergence implies both local normal convergence and compact normal convergence. And if the domain is [[locally compact]] (even in the weakest sense), then local normal convergence implies compact normal convergence.

==Functions defined on a measure space==
{{Main|Convergence of random variables}}
If one considers sequences of [[measurable function]]s, then several modes of convergence that depend on measure-theoretic, rather than solely topological properties, arise. This includes pointwise convergence almost-everywhere, convergence in ''p''-mean and convergence in measure. These are of particular interest in [[probability theory]].

The '''Object Constraint Language''' ('''OCL''') is a [[declarative language]] describing rules applying to [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) models developed at [[IBM]] and is now part of the UML standard. Initially, OCL was merely a formal specification language extension for UML.&lt;ref&gt;Object Management Group (OMG); ''Object Constraint Language Specification'', Chapter 7 of ''OMG Unified Modeling Language Specification'', Version 1.3, March 2000 (first edition)&lt;/ref&gt; OCL may now be used with any [[Meta-Object Facility]] (MOF) [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) [[Metamodeling|meta-model]], including UML.&lt;ref&gt;Object Management Group (OMG); ''Object Constraint Language OMG Available Specification Version 2.0'', May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Object Constraint Language is a precise text language that provides constraint and object query expressions on any MOF model or meta-model that cannot otherwise be expressed by diagrammatic notation. OCL is a key component of the new OMG standard recommendation for transforming models, the Queries/Views/Transformations ([[QVT]]) specification.

== Description ==
OCL is a descendant of [[Syntropy (Software)|Syntropy]], a second-generation object-oriented analysis and design method. The OCL 1.4 definition specified a constraint language. In OCL 2.0, the definition has been extended to include general object query language definitions.

OCL statements are constructed in four parts:

# a context that defines the limited situation in which the statement is valid 
# a property that represents some characteristics of the context (e.g., if the context is a class, a property might be an attribute)
# an operation (e.g., arithmetic, set-oriented) that manipulates or qualifies a property, and 
# keywords (e.g., if, then, else, and, or, not, implies) that are used to specify conditional expressions.

==Relation==
=== OCL and UML ===
OCL supplements [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] by providing expressions that have neither the ambiguities of natural language nor the inherent difficulty of using complex mathematics. OCL is also a navigation language for graph-based models.

=== OCL and MOF ===
OCL makes a [[Meta-Object Facility]] model more precise by associating assertions with its meta-elements.

=== OCL and QVT ===
Of particular importance to [[Model Driven Engineering]] (MDE) or [[model-driven architecture]] is the notion of [[Model transformation]]. The [[Object Management Group|OMG]] has defined a specific standard for model transformation called '''MOF/QVT''' or in short [[QVT]]. Several model transformation languages like [[GReAT]], [[VIATRA]], or [[Tefkat]] are presently available, with different levels of compliance with the QVT standard. Many of these languages are built on top of OCL, which is the main part of the [[QVT]]-compliance.

== Alternatives ==
Being a rule-based validation language, [[Schematron]] may be considered an alternative to OCL. However Schematron works for Extensible Markup Language [[XML tree|(XML) tree]]s while OCL makes it possible to navigate [[Meta-Object Facility|MOF]]-based models and meta-models (i.e. XML Metadata Interchange ([[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]]) trees). In other words, OCL relates to [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] or MOF similarly to how Schematron relates to [[XML]]. (Note that Schematron uses [[XPath]] to navigate inside the XML trees.)&lt;br&gt;Being a model specification language permitting designers to decorate a model or a meta-model with side-effect-free annotations, OCL could be replaced by languages like [[Alloy language|Alloy]]. Automated OCL generation is possible through Natural Language like [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~bxb/NL2OCLviaSBVR/ NL2OCL].&lt;ref name="NL2OCL"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Imran Sarwar Bajwa|title=OCL Constraints Generation from Natural Language Specification, 2010|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5630350|publisher =[[IEEE]]|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

=== Constraints ===
# The age of a person is not negative.
# A person is younger than its parents.
# After a birthday, a person becomes one year older.
# A Person has 2 parents at max.
# After somebody got a child, his/her child-set is not empty, and it is larger than before.
# Only an adult can be owner of a car.
# The first registration of a car can not be before it is built.
# Every Person that has a car has at least one car which is younger than the Person.
# Nobody can be his/her own parent.
# There's at least one Person which owns a car.

=== OCL Constraints ===
# &lt;code&gt;'''context''' Person '''inv''': self.age &gt;=0&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;'''context''' Person '''inv''': self.parents-&gt;forAll(p|p.age&gt;self.age)&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;'''context''' Person::hasBirthday() '''post''': self.age=self.age@pre+1&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;'''context''' Person '''inv''': self.parents-&gt;size()&lt;=2&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;'''context''' Person::getsChild() '''post''': self.childs-&gt;notEmpty() and self.childs-&gt;size() &gt; self.childs@pre-&gt;size()&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;'''context''' Person '''inv''': self.age&lt;18 '''implies''' self.cars-&gt;isEmpty()&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;'''context''' Auto '''inv''': self.registration&gt;=self.constructionYear&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;'''context''' Person '''inv''': self.cars-&gt;notEmpty() '''implies''' self.cars-&gt;exists( c | '''Calendar.YEAR''' - c.constructionYear &lt; self.age)&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;'''context''' Person '''inv''': self.parents-&gt;excludes(self)&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;'''context''' Person '''inv''': Person.allInstances()-&gt;exists(p | p.cars-&gt;size() &gt; 0)&lt;/code&gt;

A '''quantum spin model''' is a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|quantum Hamiltonian]] model that describes a system which consists of spins either interacting or not and are an active area of research in the fields of [[strongly correlated material|strongly correlated electron]] systems, [[quantum information theory]], and [[quantum computing]]. The [[physical observables]] in these quantum models are actually operators in a [[Hilbert space]] acting on state vectors as opposed to the physical observables in the corresponding classical [[spin model]]s - like the [[Ising model]] - which are [[commutative]] variables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">In [[complex analysis]], a branch of mathematics, the '''residue at infinity''' is a [[Residue (complex analysis)|residue]] of a [[holomorphic function]] on an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] having an infinite external radius.  The ''infinity'' &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is a point added to the local space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C &lt;/math&gt; in order to render it [[compact space|compact]] (in this case it is a [[Alexandroff extension|one-point compactification]]). This space noted &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbb C} &lt;/math&gt; is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Riemann sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Michèle Audin, ''Analyse Complexe'', lecture notes of the University of Strasbourg [http://www-irma.u-strasbg.fr/~maudin/analysecomp.pdf available on the web], pp. 70–72&lt;/ref&gt; One can use the residue at infinity to calculate some [[integral]]s.

==Definition==
Given a holomorphic function ''f'' on an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] &lt;math&gt; A(0, R, \infty) &lt;/math&gt; (centered at 0, with inner radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and infinite outer radius), the '''residue at infinity''' of the function ''f'' can be defined in terms of the usual [[residue (mathematics)|residue]] as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Res}(f,\infty) = -\mathrm{Res}\left( {1\over z^2}f\left({1\over z}\right), 0  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, one can transfer the study of &lt;math&gt; f(z) &lt;/math&gt; at infinity to the study of &lt;math&gt; f(1/z) &lt;/math&gt; at the origin.

Note that &lt;math&gt;\forall r &gt; R&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Res}(f, \infty) = {-1\over 2\pi i}\int_{C(0, r)} f(z) \, dz&lt;/math&gt;

In [[computer science]], the '''sign bit''' is a [[bit]] in a [[signed number representation]] that indicates the [[sign (mathematics)|sign]] of a number.  Although only [[signedness|signed]] numeric data types have a sign bit, it is invariably located in the [[most significant bit]] position, so the term may be used interchangeably with "most significant bit" in some contexts.

Almost always, if the sign bit is 0, the number is non-negative (positive or zero).  If the sign bit is 1 then the number is negative, although formats other than [[two's complement]] integers allow a [[signed zero]]: distinct "positive zero" and "negative zero" representations, the latter of which does not correspond to the mathematical concept of a [[negative number]].

In the two's complement representation, the sign bit has the [[positional notation|weight]] {{math|−2&lt;sup&gt;''w''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} where {{mvar|w}} is the number of bits.  In the ones' complement representation, the most negative value is {{math|1 − 2&lt;sup&gt;''w''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, but there are [[signed zero|two representations of zero]], one for each value of the sign bit.  In a [[sign-and-magnitude]] representation of numbers, the value of the sign bit determines whether the numerical value is positive or negative.&lt;ref name=Bryant/&gt;{{Rp|52–54}}

[[Floating point]] numbers, such as [[IEEE floating point|IEEE format]], [[IBM Floating Point Architecture|IBM format]], [[VAX]] format, and even the format used by the Zuse [[Z1 (computer)|Z1]] and [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] use a sign-and-magnitude representation.

When using a complement representation, to convert a signed number to a wider format the additional bits must be filled with copies of the sign bit in order to preserve its numerical value,&lt;ref name=Bryant/&gt;{{Rp|61–62}} a process called ''[[sign extension]]'' or ''sign propagation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.adrc.com/glossary/s1.html |title=Data Dictionary (Glossary and Algorithms) |website=Adroit Data Recovery Centre Pte Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Smith's Prize''' was the name of each of two prizes awarded annually to two research students in [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1769.&lt;ref name=BG&gt;{{Citation|first=June|last=Barrow-Green|title=A Corrective to the Spirit of too Exclusively Pure Mathematics: Robert Smith (1689–1768) and his Prizes at Cambridge University|journal=Annals of Science|volume=56|year=1999|pages=271–316|doi=10.1080/000337999296418|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the reorganization in 1998, it is now awarded under the name of '''Smith-Knight Prize''' and '''Rayleigh-Knight Prize'''.

==History==

The Smith Prize fund was founded by bequest of [[Robert Smith (mathematician)|Robert Smith]] upon his death in 1768, having by his will left £3500 [[South Sea Company]] stock to the University. Every year two or more junior [[Bachelor of Arts]] students who had made the greatest progress in mathematics and natural philosophy were to be awarded a prize from the fund. The prize was awarded every year from 1769 to 1998 except 1917.

From 1769 to 1885, the prize was awarded for the best performance in a series of examinations. In 1854 [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Stokes]] included an examination question on a particular theorem which [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] had written to him about, which is now known as [[Stokes' theorem]]. [[Thomas William Körner|T. W. Körner]] notes
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Only a small number of students took the Smith's prize examination in the nineteenth century. When [[Karl Pearson]] took the examination in 1879, the examiners were [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|Stokes]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]], and [[Isaac Todhunter|Todhunter]] and the examinees went on each occasion to an examiner's dwelling, did a morning paper, had lunch there and continued their work on the paper in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/current/weekly/6138/16.html |title=Discussion on the establishment of a degree of Master of Mathematics and a degree of Master of Advanced Study |publisher=Cambridge University |date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2009-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902022108/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/current/weekly/6138/16.html |archivedate=2 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1885, the examination was renamed ''Part III'', (now known as the [[Certificate of Advanced Study in Mathematics]]) and the prize was awarded for the best submitted essay rather than examination performance. According to Barrow-Green
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By fostering an interest in the study of applied mathematics, the competition contributed towards the success in mathematical physics that was to become the hallmark of Cambridge mathematics during the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=BG /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the twentieth century, the competition stimulated postgraduate research in mathematics in Cambridge and the competition has played a significant role by providing a springboard for graduates considering an academic career. The majority of prize-winners have gone on to become professional mathematicians or physicists.

The '''Rayleigh Prize''' was an additional prize, which was awarded for the first time in 1911.

The Smith's and Rayleigh prizes were only available to Cambridge graduate students who had been undergraduates at Cambridge. The '''J.T. Knight Prize''' was established in 1974 for Cambridge graduates who had been undergraduates at other universities. The prize commemorates J.T. Knight (1942-1970), who had been an undergraduate student at Glasgow and a graduate student at Cambridge. He was killed in a motor car accident in Ireland in April 1970.

===Value of the prizes===
Originally, in 1769, the prizes were worth £25 each and remained at that level for 100 years. In 1867, they fell to £23 and in 1915 were still reported to be worth that amount.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} By 1930, the value had risen to about £30, and by 1940, the value had risen by a further one pound to £31. By 1998, a Smith’s Prize was worth around £250.&lt;ref name=BG /&gt;

In 2007, the value of the three prize funds was roughly £175,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2006-07/special/09/section_g.pdf Cambridge University Trust Funds] p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reorganization of prizes===
In 1998 the Smith Prize, Rayleigh Prize and J. T. Knight Prize were replaced by the '''Smith-Knight Prize''' and '''Rayleigh-Knight Prize''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/1998-9/weekly/5755/20.html Reporter 11/11/98: Graces submitted to the Regent House on 11 November 1998&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the standard for the former being higher than that required for the latter.

In [[geometry]] a '''space diagonal''' (also '''interior diagonal''' or '''body diagonal''') of a [[polyhedron]] is a line connecting two [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] that are not on the same [[face (geometry)|face]]. Space diagonals contrast with [[face diagonal]]s, which connect vertices on the same face (but not on the same [[edge (geometry)|edge]]) as each other.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Kern, James R Bland,''Solid Mensuration with proofs'', 1938, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] has no space diagonals, while a [[cube]] (shown at right) or more generally a [[parallelepiped]] has four space diagonals.

== Axial diagonal==
An '''axial diagonal''' is a space diagonal that passes through the center of a polyhedron.

For example, in a [[cube]] with edge length ''a'', all four space diagonals are axial diagonals, of common length &lt;math&gt;a\sqrt {3}.&lt;/math&gt; More generally, a [[cuboid]]  with edge lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' has all four space diagonals axial, with common length &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

A regular [[octahedron]] has 3 axial diagonals, of length &lt;math&gt;a\sqrt {2}&lt;/math&gt;, with edge length ''a''. 

A [[regular icosahedron]] has 6 axial diagonals of length &lt;math&gt;a\sqrt {2+\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[golden ratio]] &lt;math&gt;(1+\sqrt 5)/2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Platonic &amp; Archimedean Solids|series=Wooden Books|first=Daud|last=Sutton|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=2002|isbn=9780802713865|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vgo7bTxDmIsC&amp;pg=PA55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Space diagonals of magic cubes==

For a cube to be considered [[magic cube|magic]], the four space diagonals must each sum to the sum number as does each row, each column, and each pillar.

== ''r''-agonals ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2017}}
This section applies particularly to [[magic hypercubes]].

The magic hypercube community has started to recognize an abbreviated expression for these ''space diagonals''. By using ''r'' as a variable to describe the various ''agonals'', a concise notation is possible.

If ''r'' = 
* 2 then we have a diagonal. 2 coordinates change. 
* 3 = a ''triagonal''. 3 coordinates change
* 4 = a ''quadragonal''. 4 coordinates change
* ''n'' = the dimension of the [[hypercube]], the ''2&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;'' agonals are required to sum correctly for the hypercube to be considered magic.
...
By extension, if ''r'' =
* 1, the line is parallel to a face. Only 1 coordinate changes. A 1-agonal may be called a monagonal, in keeping with a diagonal, a triagonal, etc. Lines parallel to the faces of the hypercube have, in the past, also been referred to as i-rows.

Because the prefix ''pan'' indicates ''all'', we can concisely state the characteristics or a magic hypercube.

For example;
* If pan-''r''-agonals sum correctly for ''r'' = 1 and 2, we know the square is pandiagonal magic.
* If pan-''r''-agonals sum correctly for ''r'' = 1 and 3, we have a pantriagonal magic cube (the equivalent of a pandiagonal magic square).
* If the ''r''-agonals sum correctly for ''r'' = 1 and ''n'', then the magic hypercube is simple magic regardless of what dimension it is.

The length of an ''r''-agonal of a [[hypercube]] with side length ''a'' is &lt;math&gt;a\sqrt {r}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5201">'''Superslow processes''' are processes in which values change so little that their capture is very difficult because of their smallness in comparison with the measurement error.&lt;ref name="supersl"&gt;{{citation |first=Vladimir M. |last=Miklyukov |url=http://www.uchimsya.info/SuperslowPrAbstract.pdf |title=Abstract|periodical=uchimsya.info |accessdate=10/25/09;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the time, the superslow processes lie beyond the scope of investigation due to the reason of their superslowness.  Multiple gaps can be easily detected in [[biology]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[mechanics]], [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[ecology]], [[gerontology]], etc.&lt;ref name="supersl" /&gt;

Traditional scientific research in this area was focused on the describing some brain reactions.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;See N.A.Aladjanova ({{lang-ru|Н.А. Аладжанова}}, 1979), V.A.Ilyukhina ({{lang-ru|В.А.Илюхина}}, 1982), Z.G.Khabaeva ({{lang-ru|З.Г.Хабаева}}, L.I.Nikitina {{lang-ru|Л.И.Никитина}}, 1986), I.B.Zabolotskih ({{lang-ru|И.Б.Заболотских}}, A.

In 2003, the term ''superslow processes'' was brought to wide attention by Russian mathematician [[Vladimir Miklyukov]] who founded ''Superslow Processes laboratory'' on the base of the [[Volgograd State University]] ([[Russia]]).  Reports of seminar members are published yearly in ''Notes of the Seminar 'Superslow Processes'''.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

In [[mathematics]], when the fluid flows through thin and long tubes it forms [[Stagnation point|stagnation zones]] where the flow becomes almost immobile.  If the ratio of tube length to its diameter is large, then the potential function and stream function are almost invariable on very extended areas.  The situation seems uninteresting, but if we remember that these minor changes occur in the extra-long intervals, we see here a series of first-class tasks that require the development of special mathematical methods.

[[A priori and a posteriori|Apriori]] information regarding the [[Stagnation point|stagnation zones]]  contributes to optimization of the [[computational process]] by replacing the unknown functions with the corresponding constants in such zones.  Sometimes this makes it possible to significantly reduce the amount of computation, for example in approximate calculation of [[conformal map]]ings of strongly elongated rectangles.

The obtained results are particularly useful for applications in [[economic geography]].  In a case where the function describes the intensity of [[Commodity#Commodity trade|commodity trade]], a theorem about its stagnation zones gives us (under appropriate restrictions on the selected  model) [[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing|geometric dimensions]] estimates of the stagnation zone of the world-economy (for more information about a ''stagnation zone of the world-economy'', see [[Fernand Braudel]], Les Jeux de L'echange).&lt;ref&gt;[[Fernand Braudel]], ''Civilisation matérielle, économie et capitalisme, XV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;-XVIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'': ''Les jeux de l'échange'', Civilisation Paris, 1979, {{ISBN|2-253-06456-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if the subarc of a domain boundary has zero transparency, and the flow of the [[gradient vector field]] of the function through the rest of the boundary is small enough, then the domain for such function is its stagnation zone.

Stagnation zones [[theorem]]s are closely related to pre-[[Liouville's theorem (disambiguation)|Liouville's theorem]]s about evaluation of solutions fluctuation, which direct consequences are the different versions of the classic [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville theorem]] about conversion of the entire [[doubly periodic function]] into the identical constant.

Identification of what parameters impact the sizes of stagnation zones opens up opportunities for practical recommendations on targeted changes in configuration (reduction or increase) of such zones.

Any pair of adjacent vertices can be mapped to another by an [[Graph automorphism|automorphism]], since any five-vertex ring can be mapped to any other.]]

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ''G'' is '''symmetric''' (or '''arc-transitive''') if, given any two pairs of adjacent vertices ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;—''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''G'', there is an [[Graph automorphism|automorphism]]

:''f'' : ''V''(''G'') → ''V''(''G'')

such that

:''f''(''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="biggs"&gt;{{cite book | author=Biggs, Norman | title=Algebraic Graph Theory | edition=2nd | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1993 | pages=118–140 | isbn=0-521-45897-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, a graph is symmetric if its automorphism [[group (mathematics)|group]] [[group action|acts transitively]] upon ordered pairs of adjacent vertices (that is, upon edges considered as having a direction).&lt;ref name="godsil"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Chris|last1=Godsil|authorlink1=Chris Godsil|first2=Gordon|last2=Royle|authorlink2=Gordon Royle|title=Algebraic Graph Theory| location=New York| publisher=Springer | year=2001 | page=59 | isbn=0-387-95220-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a graph is sometimes also called '''1-arc-transitive'''&lt;ref name="godsil"/&gt; or '''flag-transitive'''.&lt;ref name="babai"&gt;{{Cite book | first = L | last = Babai | editor-last = Graham | editor-first = R | editor2-last =  Grötschel | editor2-first = M | editor2-link = Martin Grötschel | editor3-last = Lovász | editor3-first = L | title = Handbook of Combinatorics | contribution = Automorphism groups, isomorphism, reconstruction | contribution-url = http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/files/tr_authentic/TR-94-10.ps | year = 1996 | publisher = Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By definition (ignoring ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a symmetric graph without isolated vertices must also be [[Vertex-transitive graph|vertex-transitive]].&lt;ref name="biggs" /&gt; Since the definition above maps one edge to another, a symmetric graph must also be [[Edge-transitive graph|edge-transitive]]. However, an edge-transitive graph need not be symmetric, since ''a''—''b'' might map to ''c''—''d'', but not to ''d''—''c''. [[Semi-symmetric graph]]s, for example, are edge-transitive and [[regular graph|regular]], but not vertex-transitive.

{{Graph families defined by their automorphisms}}

Every connected symmetric graph must thus be both vertex-transitive and edge-transitive, and the converse is true for graphs of odd degree.&lt;ref name="babai" /&gt;  However, for even degree, there exist connected graphs which are vertex-transitive and edge-transitive, but not symmetric.&lt;ref&gt;Bouwer, Z. "Vertex and Edge Transitive, But Not 1-Transitive Graphs." Canad. Math. Bull. 13, 231&amp;ndash;237, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such graphs are called [[half-transitive graph|half-transitive]].&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gross, J.L.  |author2=Yellen, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Handbook of Graph Theory | publisher=CRC Press | year=2004| page=491 | isbn=1-58488-090-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest connected half-transitive graph is [[Holt's graph]], with degree 4 and 27 vertices.&lt;ref name="biggs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A graph which is edge transitive but not arc transitive|first=Derek F.|last=Holt|journal=Journal of Graph Theory|volume=5|issue=2|pages=201–204|year=1981|doi=10.1002/jgt.3190050210}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Confusingly, some authors use the term "symmetric graph" to mean a graph which is vertex-transitive and edge-transitive, rather than an arc-transitive graph. Such a definition would include half-transitive graphs, which are excluded under the definition above.

A [[distance-transitive graph]] is one where instead of considering pairs of adjacent vertices (i.e. vertices a distance of 1 apart), the definition covers two pairs of vertices, each the same distance apart. Such graphs are automatically symmetric, by definition.&lt;ref name="biggs" /&gt;

A ''t''-arc is defined to be a sequence of ''t''+1 vertices, such that any two consecutive vertices in the sequence are adjacent, and with any repeated vertices being more than 2 steps apart. A '''''t''-transitive graph''' is a graph such that the automorphism group acts transitively on ''t''-arcs, but not on (''t''+1)-arcs.  Since 1-arcs are simply edges, every symmetric graph of degree 3 or more must be ''t''-transitive for some ''t'', and the value of ''t'' can be used to further classify symmetric graphs.  The cube is 2-transitive, for example.&lt;ref name="biggs" /&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;!--Please do not change section heading as "Foster Census" and "Foster census" redirect to it.--&gt;
Combining the symmetry condition with the restriction that graphs be [[Cubic graph|cubic]] (i.e. all vertices have degree 3) yields quite a strong condition, and such graphs are rare enough to be listed.  The '''Foster census''' and its extensions provide such lists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marston Conder]], ''[http://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~conder/preprints/cubic768.ps Trivalent symmetric graphs on up to 768 vertices],'' J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput, vol. 20, pp. 41&amp;ndash;63&lt;/ref&gt; The Foster census was begun in the 1930s by [[R. M. Foster|Ronald M.

''[[Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers]]'' '''51''', 309&amp;ndash;317, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1988 (when Foster was 92&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt;) the then current Foster census (listing all cubic symmetric graphs up to 512 vertices) was published in book form.&lt;ref&gt;"The Foster Census: R.M.

Other well known cubic symmetric graphs are the [[Dyck graph]], the [[Foster graph]] and the [[Biggs&amp;ndash;Smith graph]].  The ten distance-transitive graphs listed above, together with the [[Foster graph]] and the [[Biggs&amp;ndash;Smith graph]], are the only cubic distance-transitive graphs.

Non-cubic symmetric graphs include [[cycle graph]]s (of degree 2), [[complete graph]]s (of degree 4 or more when there are 5 or more vertices), [[hypercube graph]]s (of degree 4 or more when there are 16 or more vertices), and the graphs formed by the vertices and edges of the [[octahedron]], [[icosahedron]], [[cuboctahedron]], and [[icosidodecahedron]]. The [[Rado graph]] forms an example of a symmetric graph with infinitely many vertices and infinite degree.

== Properties ==
The [[Connectivity (graph theory)|vertex-connectivity]] of a symmetric graph is always equal to the [[regular graph|degree]] ''d''.&lt;ref name="babai" /&gt; In contrast, for [[vertex-transitive graph]]s in general, the vertex-connectivity is bounded below by 2(''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/3.&lt;ref name="godsil" /&gt;

A ''t''-transitive graph of degree 3 or more has [[Girth (graph theory)|girth]] at least 2(''t''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1).  However, there are no finite ''t''-transitive graphs of degree 3 or more for&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;8.  In the case of the degree being exactly 3 (cubic symmetric graphs), there are none for&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;6.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n(n+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

(the series of [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s of [[pronic number]]s) simplifies as 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n(n+1)} &amp; {} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right) \\
{} &amp; {} = \lim_{N\to\infty} \sum_{n=1}^N \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right) \\
{} &amp; {} = \lim_{N\to\infty} \left\lbrack {\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3}\right) + \cdots + \left(\frac{1}{N} - \frac{1}{N+1}\right) } \right\rbrack  \\
{} &amp; {} = \lim_{N\to\infty} \left\lbrack {  1 + \left( - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left( - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}\right) + \cdots + \left( - \frac{1}{N} + \frac{1}{N}\right) - \frac{1}{N+1} } \right\rbrack \\
{} &amp; {} = \lim_{N\to\infty} \left\lbrack {  1  - \frac{1}{N+1} } \right\rbrack = 1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==In general==
Let &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of numbers. Then, 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^N \left(a_n - a_{n-1}\right) =  a_N - a_{0},&lt;/math&gt;

and, if &lt;math&gt;a_n \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(a_n - a_{n-1}\right) =  - a_{0}.&lt;/math&gt;

==More examples==

* Many [[trigonometric function]]s also admit representation as a difference, which allows telescopic cancelling between the consecutive terms.

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{n=1}^N \sin\left(n\right) &amp; {} = \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{2} \csc\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(2\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\sin\left(n\right)\right) \\
&amp; {} =\frac{1}{2} \csc\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \sum_{n=1}^N \left(\cos\left(\frac{2n-1}{2}\right) -\cos\left(\frac{2n+1}{2}\right)\right) \\
&amp; {} =\frac{1}{2} \csc\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(\cos\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) -\cos\left(\frac{2N+1}{2}\right)\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

* Some sums of the form

::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^N {f(n) \over g(n)},&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''f'' and ''g'' are [[polynomial function]]s whose quotient may be broken up into [[partial fraction]]s, will fail to admit [[summation]] by this method.  In particular, one has

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum^\infty_{n=0}\frac{2n+3}{(n+1)(n+2)} &amp; {} =\sum^\infty_{n=0}\left(\frac{1}{n+1}+\frac{1}{n+2}\right) \\
&amp; {} = \left(\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\right) + \cdots \\
&amp; {} \cdots + \left(\frac{1}{n-1} + \frac{1}{n}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n+1}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{n+2}\right) + \cdots \\
&amp; {} =\infty.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:The problem is that the terms do not cancel.

* Let ''k'' be a positive integer.  Then

::&lt;math&gt;\sum^\infty_{n=1} {\frac{1}{n(n+k)}} = \frac{H_k}{k} &lt;/math&gt;

:where ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''k''th [[harmonic number]].  All of the terms after 1/(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) cancel.

== An application in probability theory ==

In [[probability theory]], a [[Poisson process]] is a stochastic process of which the simplest case involves "occurrences" at random times, the waiting time until the next occurrence having a [[memorylessness|memoryless]] [[exponential distribution]], and the number of "occurrences" in any time interval having a [[Poisson distribution]] whose expected value is proportional to the length of the time interval.  Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of "occurrences" before time ''t'', and let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; be the waiting time until the ''x''th "occurrence".  We seek the [[probability density function]] of the [[random variable]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;.  We use the [[probability mass function]] for the Poisson distribution, which tells us that

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(X_t = x) = \frac{(\lambda t)^x e^{-\lambda t}}{x!}, &lt;/math&gt;

where λ is the average number of occurrences in any time interval of length 1.  Observe that the event {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ x} is the same as the event {''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''t''}, and thus they have the same probability.  The density function we seek is therefore

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f(t) &amp; {} = \frac{d}{dt}\Pr(T_x \le t) = \frac{d}{dt}\Pr(X_t \ge x) = \frac{d}{dt}(1 - \Pr(X_t \le x-1)) \\  \\
&amp; {} =  \frac{d}{dt}\left( 1 - \sum_{u=0}^{x-1} \Pr(X_t = u)\right)
= \frac{d}{dt}\left( 1 - \sum_{u=0}^{x-1} \frac{(\lambda t)^u e^{-\lambda t}}{u!}  \right) \\  \\
&amp; {} = \lambda e^{-\lambda t} - e^{-\lambda t} \sum_{u=1}^{x-1} \left( \frac{\lambda^ut^{u-1}}{(u-1)!} - \frac{\lambda^{u+1} t^u}{u!} \right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The sum telescopes, leaving

: &lt;math&gt; f(t) = \frac{\lambda^x t^{x-1} e^{-\lambda t}}{(x-1)!}. &lt;/math&gt;

The '''tilde''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪ|l|d|ə}}&lt;ref name=ah&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=tilde tilde] in the American Heritage dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪ|l|d|i}}; '''˜''' or '''~''')&lt;ref&gt;Several more or less common informal names are used for the tilde that usually describe the shape, including ''squiggly'', ''squiggle(s)'', and ''flourish''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[grapheme]] with several uses. The name of the character came into English from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], which in turn came from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:titulus|titulus]]'', meaning "title" or "superscription".&lt;ref name=ah/&gt;

The reason for the name was that it was originally written over a letter as a [[scribal abbreviation]], as a "mark of suspension", shown as a straight line when used with capitals. Thus the commonly used words ''[[Anno Domini]]'' were frequently abbreviated to ''A&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; Dñi'', an elevated terminal with a suspension mark placed over the "n". Such a mark could denote the omission of one letter or several letters. This saved on the expense of the scribe's labour and the cost of vellum and ink. Medieval European charters written in Latin are largely made up of such abbreviated words with suspension marks and other abbreviations; only uncommon words were given in full. The tilde has since been applied to a number of other uses as a [[diacritic]] mark or a character in its own right. These are encoded in [[Unicode]] at {{unichar|0303|Combining Tilde|cwith=&amp;#x25cc;}} and {{unichar|007e|Tilde|note=as a spacing character}}, and there are [[#Similar characters|additional similar characters]] for different roles. In [[lexicography]], the latter kind of tilde and the '''[[swung dash]]''' (⁓) are used in dictionaries to indicate the omission of the entry word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=swung+dash&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o8=1&amp;o1=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o9=&amp;o6=&amp;o3=&amp;o4=&amp;h=000000000000 | title = WordNet | type = search | edition = 3.0 | contribution = Swung dash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common use==
This symbol (in English) informally&lt;ref name=wolfram_tilde /&gt; means [[approximation|"approximately"]], "about", or "around", such as "~30 minutes before", meaning "''approximately'' 30 minutes before".&lt;ref name="bymath1"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bymath.com/symbols/symbols.html | title =All Elementary Mathematics – Mathematical symbols dictionary |publisher=Bymath | accessdate =11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/maths.aspx|title=Character design standards - Maths|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can mean "similar to",&lt;ref name="htmlhelp1"&gt;{{cite web| first =Liam | last = Quinn |url=http://htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/symbols.html |title=HTML 4.0 Entities for Symbols and Greek Letters |publisher=HTML help |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including "of the same [[order of magnitude]] as",&lt;ref name=wolfram_tilde&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tilde.html | publisher = Wolfram/MathWorld | title = Tilde |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as: "{{math |{{mvar |x}} ~ {{mvar|y}}}}" meaning that {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are of the same [[order of magnitude]]. Another approximation symbol is the double-tilde [[≈]], meaning "approximately equal to",&lt;ref name = "bymath1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="htmlhelp1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solving-math-problems.com/math-symbols-approximately-equal.html | title = Math Symbols...

The tilde is also used to indicate "equal to" or "approximately equal to" by placing it over the "=" symbol, like so: '''≅'''. In the computing field, especially in [[Unix]] based systems, the tilde indicates the user's home directory.

===Use by medieval scribes===

The text of the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, relating for example, to the [[manor of Molland]] in [[Devon]] (see image left), is highly [[Scribal abbreviation|abbreviated]] as indicated by numerous tildes. The text with abbreviations expanded is as follows:

===Role of mechanical typewriters===
The incorporation of the tilde (~) into [[ASCII]] is a direct result of its appearance as a distinct character on mechanical [[typewriters]] in the late nineteenth century. When all [[character set]]s were pieces of metal permanently installed, and number of characters much more limited than in [[typography]], the question of which languages and markets required which characters was an important one. Any good typewriter store had a catalog of alternative keyboards that could be specified for machines ordered from the factory.

At that time, the tilde was used only in Spanish and Portuguese typewriters (keyboards). In Modern Spanish, the tilde is used only with ''n'' and ''N''. Both were conveniently assigned to a single mechanical typebar, which sacrificed a key that was felt to be less important, usually the ½—¼ key.

Portuguese, however, uses not ''ñ'' but ''nh''. It uses the tilde on the vowels ''a'' and ''o''. So as not to sacrifice two of the tightly limited keys to ã Ã õ Õ, the decision was made to make the ~ a separate "dead" character in which the carriage holding the paper did not move. [[Dead key]]s, which had a notch cut out to avoid hitting a mechanical linkage that triggered carriage movement, were used for characters that were intended to be combined (overstruck).

On mechanical typewriters, Spanish keyboards (the first, or one of the first, non-English keyboards) had a dead key, which contained the [[acute accent]] (´), used over any vowel, and the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|dieresis]] (¨), used only over ''u''. It was a simple matter to create a dead key for a Portuguese keyboard (created later than the Spanish one) to be overstruck with ''a'' and ''o'' and so the ~ was born as a typographical character, which did not exist previously as a [[sort (typesetting)|type]] or [[hot-lead]] printing character. That was probably a product of the first and leading manufacturer of (mechanical) typewriters, [[E. Remington and Sons|Remington]].

==Connection to Spanish==
{{Main|Ñ}}
[[File:Logotipo del Instituto Cervantes.svg|thumbnail|left|Logo of the Instituto Cervantes]]
[[File:CNN en Español.svg|thumbnail|right|Logo of CNN en Español]]
As indicated by the etymological origin of the word "tilde" in English, this symbol has been closely associated with the [[Spanish language]]. The connection stems from the use of the tilde above the letter "n" to form "ñ" in Spanish, a feature shared by only [[Tilde#Palatal n|a few other languages]], all historically connected to Spanish. This peculiarity can help non-native speakers quickly identify a text as being written in Spanish with little chance of error. In addition, most native speakers, although [[names given to the Spanish language|not all]], use the word "espa'''ñ'''ol" to refer to their language. Particularly during the 1990s, Spanish-speaking intellectuals and news outlets demonstrated support for the language and the culture by defending this letter against [[globalisation]] and [[computer]]isation trends that threatened to remove it from keyboards and other standardised products and codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26 argumentos para seguir defendiendo la Ñ|url=http://www.larazon.es/historico/651-26-argumentos-para-seguir-defendiendo-la-n-SLLA_RAZON_352314#.Ttt1ZN8CWth9pio|website=La Razón|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=AFP|title=Batalla de la Ñ: Una aventura quijotesca para defender el alma de la lengua|url=http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/internacionales/batalla-de-la-n-una-aventura-quijotesca-para-defender-el-alma-de-la-lengua-797718.html|website=Periódico ABC Paraguay|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Instituto Cervantes]], founded by [[Spanish government|Spain's government]] to promote the Spanish language internationally, chose as its logo a highly stylised Ñ with a large tilde. The 24-hour news channel [[CNN]] in the US later adopted a similar strategy on its existing logo for the launch of its [[CNN en Español|Spanish-language version]]. And similarly to the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the [[Spain men's national basketball team]] is nicknamed ''ÑBA''.

Confusingly, in Spanish itself the word ''tilde'' is used more generally for diacritics, including the stress-marking acute accent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dle.rae.es/?id=ZkHNOE8 Diccionario de la lengua española], Real Academia Española&lt;/ref&gt;  The diacritic ''~'' is more commonly called  ''la virgulilla'' or ''la tilde de la eñe'', and is not considered an accent mark in Spanish, but rather simply a part of the letter ñ (much like [[tittle|the dot over the i]]).

==Diacritical use==
In some languages, the tilde is used as a [[diacritic]]al mark ('''&amp;thinsp;˜&amp;thinsp;''') placed over a [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] to indicate a change in pronunciation, such as [[nasalization]].

===Pitch===
It was first used in the [[Greek diacritics|polytonic orthography]] of [[Ancient Greek]], as a variant of the [[circumflex]], representing a rise in [[pitch accent|pitch]] followed by a return to standard pitch.

===Abbreviation===
[[File:Hic Fabricatur Naves.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Carta marina]]'' showing Finnish economy, with the captions ''Hic fabricantur naves'' and ''Hic fabricantur [[Bombard (weapon)|bombarde]]'' abbreviated]]
Later, it was used to make [[scribal abbreviation|abbreviations]] in medieval [[Latin language|Latin]] documents.  When an {{angle bracket|n}} or {{angle bracket|m}} followed a vowel, it was often omitted, and a tilde (i.e., a small {{angle bracket|n}}) was placed over the preceding vowel to indicate the missing letter; this is the origin of the use of tilde to indicate nasalization  (compare [[Umlaut (diacritic)#Umlaut|the development of the umlaut]] as an abbreviation of {{angle bracket|e}}.)  The practice of using the tilde over a vowel to indicate omission of an {{angle bracket|n}} or {{angle bracket|m}} continued in printed books in [[French language|French]] as a means of reducing text length until the 17th century. It was also used in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The tilde was also used occasionally to make other abbreviations, such as over the letter {{angle bracket|q}} ("[[wikt:q̃|q̃]]") to signify the word ''que'' ("that").

===Nasalization===
It is also as a small {{angle bracket|n}} that the tilde originated when written above other letters, marking a [[Latin language|Latin]] {{angle bracket|n}} which had been [[elision|elided]] in old Galician-Portuguese.  In modern [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] it indicates [[nasalization]] of the base vowel: ''mão'' "hand", from Lat. ''manu-''; ''razões'' "reasons", from Lat. ''rationes''.  This usage has been adopted in the orthographies of several [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|native languages of South America]], such as [[Guarani language|Guarani]] and [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]], as well as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) and many other phonetic alphabets. For example, {{IPA|[ljɔ̃]}} is the IPA transcription of the pronunciation of the French place-name ''[[Lyon]]''.

In [[Breton language|Breton]], the symbol {{angle bracket|ñ}} after a vowel means that the letter {{angle bracket|n}} serves only to give the vowel a nasalised pronunciation, without being itself pronounced, as it normally is. For example, {{angle bracket|an}} gives the pronunciation {{IPA|[ãn]}} whereas {{angle bracket|añ}} gives {{IPA|[ã]}}.

===Palatal n===
{{main|Ñ}}
The tilded {{angle bracket|n}} ({{angle bracket|ñ}}, {{angle bracket|Ñ}}) developed from the digraph {{angle bracket|nn}} in Spanish. In this language, {{angle bracket|ñ}} is considered a separate letter called ''[[Ñ|eñe]]'' ({{IPA-es|ˈeɲe|IPA}}), rather than a letter-diacritic combination; it is placed in Spanish dictionaries between the letters {{angle bracket|n}} and {{angle bracket|o}}. In Spanish the word ''tilde'' can refer to diacritics in general, e.g. the acute accent in ''José'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ortografía de la lengua española |year=2010 |publisher=Real Academia Española |location=Madrid |isbn=978-84-670-3426-4 |page=279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the diacritic in {{angle bracket|ñ}} can also be called "virgulilla".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=virgulilla|title=Lema en la RAE|publisher=[[Real Academia Española]]|accessdate=10 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current languages in which the tilded {{angle bracket|n}} ({{angle bracket|ñ}}) is used for the [[palatal nasal]] consonant {{IPA|/ɲ/}} include:
{{div col|colwidth=8em}}
* [[Asturian language|Asturian]]
* [[Basque language|Basque]]
* [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]]
* [[Filipino language|Filipino]]
* [[Galician language|Galician]]
* [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]]
* [[Iñupiaq]]
* [[Mapudungun]]
* [[Papiamento]]
* [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]
* [[Spanish language|Spanish]]
* [[Tetum language|Tetum]]
{{div col end}}

===Tone===
In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], a tilde over a vowel represents a creaky rising [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] (''ngã'').

===International Phonetic Alphabet===
In [[phonetics]], a tilde is used as a [[IPA diacritics|diacritic that is placed]] above a letter, below it or [[superimpose]]d onto the middle of it:

* A tilde above a letter indicates [[nasalization]], e.g. {{IPA|[ã], [ṽ]}}.
* A tilde superimposed onto the middle of a letter indicates [[velarization]] or [[pharyngealization]], e.g. {{IPA|[ɫ], [z̴]}}. If no precomposed [[Unicode]] character exists, the Unicode character {{unichar|0334|COMBINING TILDE OVERLAY|cwith=&amp;#x25cc;}} can be used to generate one.
* A tilde below a letter indicates [[Creaky voice|laryngealisation]], e.g. {{IPA|[d̰]}}. If no precomposed Unicode character exists, the Unicode character {{unichar|0330|COMBINING TILDE BELOW|cwith=&amp;#x25cc;}} can be used to generate one.

===Letter extension===
In [[Estonian language|Estonian]], the symbol {{angle bracket|õ}} stands for the [[close-mid back unrounded vowel]], and it is considered an independent letter.

===Other uses===
Some languages and alphabets use the tilde for other purposes:
* [[Arabic script]]: A symbol resembling the tilde ({{unichar|0653|ARABIC MADDAH ABOVE|cwith=&amp;#x0640;|nlink=Arabic diacritics#Maddah}}) is used over the letter {{angle bracket|ا}} ({{IPA|/a/}}) to become &lt;big&gt;{{angle bracket|[[آ]]}}&lt;/big&gt;, denoting a long {{IPA|/aː/}} sound ({{IPA|[ʔæː]}}).
* [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]]: The tilded {{angle bracket|[[G̃]]}} (note that {{angle bracket|G/g}} with tilde is not available as a precomposed glyph in [[Unicode]]) stands for the [[velar nasal]] consonant.  Also, the tilded {{angle bracket|y}} ({{angle bracket|Ỹ}}) stands for the nasalized upper central rounded vowel {{IPA|[ɨ̃]}}.  A small number of other alphabets also use {{angle bracket|g̃}}. 
* [[Syriac script]]: A tilde (~) under the letter ''[[Kaph]]'' represents a {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} sound, transliterated as ''ch'' or ''č''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eberhard Nestle|Nestle, Eberhard]] (1888). ''Syrische Grammatik mit Litteratur, Chrestomathie und Glossar''. Berlin: H. Reuther's Verlagsbuchhandlung. [translated to English as ''Syriac grammar with bibliography, chrestomathy and glossary'', by R. S. Kennedy. London: Williams &amp; Norgate 1889. p. 5].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Estonian phonology|Estonian]] uses the tilde above the letter o ('''õ''') to indicate the vowel {{IPA|[ɤ]}}, a rare sound among languages.  
* [[Unicode]] has a [[combining character|combining]] vertical tilde character: {{unichar|033E|COMBINING VERTICAL TILDE|cwith=&amp;#x25cc;}}. It is used to indicate [[tone accent|middle tone]] in linguistic transcription of certain dialects of the [[Lithuanian language]].&lt;ref&gt;Lithuanian Standards Board (LST), [http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2597.pdf proposal for a zigzag diacritic]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dot printer ASCII0x7C+.png|thumb|right|160px|Raised tilde from a [[dot matrix printer]]]]
Most modern [[proportional font]]s align plain [[spacing character|spacing]] tilde at the same level as [[dash]]es, or only slightly upper. This distinguishes it from a ''small tilde''&amp;nbsp;( ˜ ), which is always raised. But in some [[monospace font]]s, especially used in [[text user interface]]s, [[ASCII]] tilde character is raised too. This apparently is a legacy of [[typewriter]]s, where pairs of similar spacing and combining characters relied on one glyph. Even in [[line printer]]s' age character repertoires were often not large enough to distinguish between plain tilde, small tilde and combining tilde. Overprinting of a letter by the tilde was a working method of [[combining character|combining a letter]].

==Punctuation==
The tilde (~) is used in various ways in punctuation:

===Range===
In some languages (though not generally in English),{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} a tilde-like wavy dash may be used as [[punctuation]] (instead of an unspaced [[hyphen]], [[en dash]] or [[em dash]]) between two [[number]]s, to indicate a [[Interval (mathematics)|range]] rather than [[subtraction]] or a hyphenated number (such as a part number or model number). For example, "12~15" means "12 to 15", "~3" means "up to three", and "100~" means "100 and greater". [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]] and other [[East Asian languages]] almost always use this convention, but it is often done for clarity in some other languages as well. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] uses the wavy dash and full-width em dash interchangeably for this purpose. In English, the tilde is often used to express ranges and model numbers in [[electronics]], but rarely in formal grammar or in type-set documents, as a wavy dash preceding a number sometimes represents an approximation (see below).

=== Approximation ===
Before a number the tilde can mean "approximately";  "~42" means "approximately 42".&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation

| title = Abstract Math | contribution = Other symbols
}}{{better source|date=December 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]; uses [[Approximation]] as its source}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese===
{{further|Japanese punctuation#Wave dash}}

The {{Nihongo|'''wave dash'''|波ダッシュ|nami dasshu}} is used for various purposes in Japanese, including to denote ranges of numbers, in place of dashes or brackets, and to indicate origin. The wave dash is also used to separate a title and a subtitle in the same line, as a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] is used in English.

When used in conversations via email or instant messenger it may be used as a [[sarcasm mark]].

The sign is used as a replacement for the [[Chōonpu|chouon]], katakana character, in Japanese, extending the final syllable.

====Unicode and Shift JIS encoding of wave dash====
{{double image|right|Wave Dash.svg|100|Wave Dash2.svg|100|Correct JIS wave dash.|Previous Unicode wave dash (incorrect).|Correct JIS wave dash.|Previous Unicode wave dash (incorrect).}} 
In practice the {{Nihongo|'''full-width tilde'''|全角チルダ|zenkaku chiruda}}, Unicode U+FF5E, is often used instead of the {{Nihongo|'''wave dash'''|波ダッシュ|nami dasshu}}, Unicode U+301C, because the [[Shift JIS]] code for the wave dash, 0x8160, which is supposed to be mapped to U+301C,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://x0213.org/codetable/sjis-0213-2004-std.txt | title = JIS X 0213:2004 | chapter = Appendix 1: Shift_JIS-2004 vs Unicode mapping table | publisher = X 0213}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/OBSOLETE/EASTASIA/JIS/SHIFTJIS.TXT | title = Shift-JIS to Unicode | publisher = Unicode}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is instead mapped to U+FF5E&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/dbcs/932/932_81.htm |title=Windows 932_81 |publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[code page 932 (Microsoft Windows)|Windows code page 932]] ([[Microsoft]]'s [[code page]] for Japanese), a widely used extension of Shift JIS.

This avoided a shape definition error in the Unicode code charts: the wave dash reference glyph in JIS / Shift JIS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |place=[[Japan|JP]] |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/087.pdf |title=ISO-IR-087: Japanese Graphic Character Set for Information Interchange |publisher=Information Technology Standards Commission of Japan (IPSJ/ITSCJ) |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jisplane1"&gt;{{cite web| place = [[Japan|JP]] | url = http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/ISO-IR/233.pdf | title = ISO-IR-233: Japanese Graphic Character Set for Information Interchange, Plane 1 | publisher = Information Technology Standards Commission of Japan (IPSJ/ITSCJ) | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; matches the Unicode reference glyph for '''U+FF5E''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFF00.pdf | title = Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms | type = chart | publisher = Unicode}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while the reference glyph for '''U+301C'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130827100409if_/http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U3000.pdf | title = CJK Symbols and Punctuation (Unicode 6.2) | type = chart | publisher = Unicode}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was reflected, incorrectly,&lt;ref name="errata8"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/erratafixed.html|title=Errata Fixed in Unicode 8.0.0|publisher=Unicode}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Unicode imported the JIS wave dash. In other platforms such as the [[classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]], 0x8160 is correctly mapped to U+301C. It is generally difficult, if not impossible, for users of Japanese Windows to type U+301C, especially in legacy, non-Unicode applications.

A similar situation exists regarding the Korean [[KS X 1001]] character set, in which Microsoft maps the [[EUC-KR]] or [[Unified Hangul Code|UHC]] code for the wave dash (0xA1AD) to U+223C (Tilde Operator),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ssl.icu-project.org/icu-bin/convexp?conv=windows-949-2000&amp;b=A1&amp;s=ALL#layout|title=windows-949-2000 (lead byte A1)|work=ICU Demonstration - Converter Explorer|publisher=International Components for Unicode}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc194958.aspx|title=Lead Byte A1-A2 (Code page 949)|work=MSDN|publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[IBM]] and [[Apple, Inc|Apple]] map it to U+301C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ssl.icu-project.org/icu-bin/convexp?conv=ibm-1363_P110-1997&amp;b=A1&amp;s=ALL#layout|title=ibm-1363_P110-1997 (lead byte A1)|work=ICU Demonstration - Converter Explorer|publisher=International Components for Unicode}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ssl.icu-project.org/icu-bin/convexp?conv=euc-kr&amp;b=A1&amp;s=ALL#layout|title=euc-kr (lead byte A1)|work=ICU Demonstration - Converter Explorer|publisher=International Components for Unicode}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/KOREAN.TXT|title=Map (external version) from Mac OS Korean encoding to Unicode 3.2 and later.|publisher=Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Unicode reference glyph for U+301C has been corrected&lt;ref name="errata8"/&gt; to match the JIS standard&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U3000.pdf | title = CJK Symbols and Punctuation | type = chart | publisher = Unicode}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to a 2014 proposal, which noted that while the existing Unicode reference glyph had been matched by fonts from the discontinued [[Windows XP]], all other major platforms including later versions of Microsoft Windows matched the JIS reference glyph for U+301C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14198-wave-dash.pdf | title=L2/14-198: Proposal for the modification of the sample character layout of WAVE_DASH (U+301C) | last=Komatsu | first=Hiroyuki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JIS / Shift JIS wave dash is still formally mapped to U+301C as of [[JIS X 0213]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://x0213.org/codetable/sjis-0213-2004-std.txt | title=Shift_JIS-2004 (JIS X 0213:2004 Appendix 1) vs Unicode mapping table | publisher=x0213.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the [[WHATWG]] Encoding Standard used by [[HTML5]] follows Microsoft in mapping 0x8160 to U+FF5E.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/shift_jis.html | title=Shift_JIS visualization | work=Encoding Standard | publisher=WHATWG}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two code points have a similar or identical glyph in several fonts, reducing the confusion and incompatibility.

==Mathematics==

===As a unary operator===

A tilde in front of a single quantity can mean "approximately", "about" or "of the same [[order of magnitude]] as."

In written [[mathematical logic]], the tilde represents [[negation]]: "~''p''" means "not ''p''", where "''p''"  is a [[proposition]].  Modern use often replaces the tilde with the negation symbol (¬) for this purpose, to avoid confusion with [[equivalence relation]]s.

===As a relational operator===

In [[mathematics]], the tilde operator (Unicode U+223C), sometimes called "twiddle", is often used to denote an [[equivalence relation]] between two objects.  Thus "{{math|{{mvar|x}} ~ {{mvar|y}}}}" means "{{mvar|x}} is [[equivalence relation|equivalent]] to {{mvar|y}}". It is a weaker statement than stating that {{mvar|x}} [[equality (mathematics)|equals]] {{mvar|y}}. The expression "{{math|{{mvar|x}} ~ {{mvar |y}}}}" is sometimes read aloud as "{{mvar|x}} twiddles {{mvar|y}}", perhaps as an analogue to the verbal expression of "{{math |1={{mvar |x}} = {{mvar|y}}}}".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Derbyshire | first = J | title = Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics | place = New York | publisher = Penguin | year = 2004 | url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tilde.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tilde can indicate approximate equality in a variety of ways.  It can be used to denote the [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic equality]] of two functions. For example, {{math|{{mvar|f}} ({{mvar|x}}) ~ {{mvar |g}}({{mvar |x}})}} means that {{math|1=lim&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|x}} → ∞&lt;/sub&gt; {{mvar|f}}( {{mvar |x}}) ∕ {{mvar |g}}({{mvar |x}}) = 1}}.&lt;ref name=wolfram_tilde /&gt;

A tilde is also used to indicate "[[Approximation|approximately]] equal to" (e.g. 1.902 ~= 2).  This usage probably developed as a typed alternative to the [[:Image:Libra.svg|libra symbol]] used for the same purpose in written mathematics, which is an equal sign with the upper bar replaced by a bar with an upward hump, bump, ︎or loop in the middle (︍︍&amp;#x264E;&amp;#xFE0E;) or, sometimes, a tilde (≃).  The symbol "≈" is also used for this purpose.︎

In [[physics]] and [[astronomy]], a tilde can be used between two expressions (e.g. {{math|{{mvar|h}} ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; J s}}) to state that the two are of the same [[order of magnitude]].&lt;ref name=wolfram_tilde /&gt;

In [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], the tilde means "is distributed as";&lt;ref name = wolfram_tilde /&gt; see [[random variable]].

A tilde can also be used to represent geometric [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity]] (e.g. {{math |∆{{mvar |ABC}} ~ ∆{{mvar|DEF}}}}, meaning [[triangle]] {{mvar|ABC}} is similar to {{mvar|DEF}}). A triple tilde ('''≋''') is often used to show [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]], an equivalence relation in geometry.

===As an accent===

The symbol "&lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt;" is pronounced as "eff tilde" or, informally, as "eff twiddle" or, in American English, "eff wiggle".&lt;ref&gt;

A tilde placed below a letter in mathematics can represent a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity (e.g. &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n) = \underset{^\sim}{\mathbf x}&lt;/math&gt;).

In [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], a tilde placed on top of a variable is sometimes used to represent the [[median]] of that variable; thus &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\mathbf y}&lt;/math&gt; would indicate the median of the variable &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y&lt;/math&gt;. A tilde over the letter n (&lt;math&gt;\tilde{n}&lt;/math&gt;) is sometimes used to indicate the [[harmonic mean]].

In machine learning, a tilde may represent a candidate value for a cell state in [[Gated recurrent unit|GRUs]] or [[LSTM]] units. (e.g. c̃)

==Physics==
Often in physics, one can consider an equilibrium solution to an equation, and then a perturbation to that equilibrium.  For the variables in the original equation (for instance &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) a substitution &lt;math&gt;X\to x+\tilde{x}&lt;/math&gt; can be made, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium part and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the perturbed part.

A tilde is also used in [[particle physics]] to denote the hypothetical [[supersymmetric]] partner.  For example, an [[electron]] is referred to by the letter ''e'', and its [[superpartner]] the [[selectron (particle)|selectron]] is written ''ẽ''.

==Economics==
For relations involving preference, [[economist]]s sometimes use the tilde to represent [[Preference (economics)#Notation|indifference]] between two or more bundles of goods.  For example, to say that a consumer is indifferent between bundles ''x'' and ''y'', an economist would write ''x'' ~ ''y''.

==Electronics==
It can approximate the sine wave symbol (∿, [[Unicode|U+]]223F), which is used in [[electronics]] to indicate [[alternating current]], in place of +, −, or ⎓ for [[direct current]].

==Computing==

=== Directories and URLs ===
On [[Unix]]-like [[operating system]]s (including [[AIX]], [[BSD]], [[Linux]] and [[macOS]]), tilde normally indicates the current user's [[home directory]]. For example, if the current user's home directory is {{mono|/home/bloggsj}}, then the command {{mono|cd ~}} is equivalent to {{mono|cd /home/bloggsj}}, {{mono|cd $HOME}}, or {{mono|cd}}. This convention derives from the [[Lear-Siegler]] [[ADM-3A]] terminal in common use during the 1970s, which happened to have the tilde symbol and the word "Home" (for moving the cursor to the upper left) on the same key.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}&lt;!-- may be true, but we need a source for "derives" --&gt; When prepended to a particular username, the tilde indicates that user's home directory (e.g., {{mono|~janedoe}} for the home directory of user {{mono|janedoe}}, such as {{mono|/home/janedoe}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Tilde expansion | publisher = The GNU project | title = C Library Manual | accessdate = 4 July 2010 | url = https://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/Tilde-Expansion.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Used in [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] on the [[World Wide Web]], it often denotes a personal website on a [[Unix]]-based server. For example, {{mono|&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.com/~johndoe/&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} might be the personal web site of John Doe. This mimics the Unix shell usage of the tilde.  However, when accessed from the web, file access is usually directed to a [[subdirectory]] in the user's home directory, such as {{mono|/home/''username''/public_html}} or {{mono|/home/''username''/www}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Module mod_userdir | publisher = The Apache foundation | title = HTTP Server Documentation | edition = version 2.0 | accessdate = 4 July 2010 | url = http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_userdir.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In URLs, the characters {{mono|%7E}} (or {{mono|%7e}}) may substitute for tilde if an input device lacks a tilde key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#page-12 | title = RFC 3986 | publisher = IETF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, {{mono|&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.com/~johndoe/&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} and {{mono|&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.com/%7Ejohndoe/&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} will behave in the same manner.

=== Computer languages ===
The tilde is used in the [[AWK]] [[programming language]] as part of the pattern match operators for [[regular expression]]s:
*&lt;code&gt;''variable'' ~ /''regex''/&lt;/code&gt; returns true if the variable is matched.
*&lt;code&gt;''variable'' !~ /''regex''/&lt;/code&gt; returns false if the variable is matched.

A variant of this, with the plain tilde replaced with &lt;code&gt;=~&lt;/code&gt;, was adopted in [[Perl]], and this semi-standardization has led to the use of these operators in other programming languages, such as [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]] or the [[SQL]] variant of the database [[PostgreSQL]].

In [[APL (programming language)|APL]] and [[MATLAB]], tilde represents the monadic logical function NOT.

In the [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming languages, the tilde character is used as [[bitwise NOT]] [[Operators in C and C++|operator]], following the notation in logic (an &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; causes a logical NOT, instead).  In C++ and C#, the tilde is also used as the first character in a [[Class (computer science)|class]]'s [[method (computer science)|method]] name (where the rest of the name must be the same name as the class) to indicate a [[destructor (computer science)|destructor]] – a special method which is called at the end of the [[Object lifetime|object's life]].

In ASP.NET application tilde ('~') is used as a shortcut to the root of the application's virtual directory.

In the [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] stylesheet language, the tilde is used for the indirect adjacent combinator as part of a selector.

In the [[D programming language]], the tilde is used as an [[Array data structure|array]] [[concatenation]] operator, as well as to indicate an object destructor and bitwise not operator.  Tilde operator can be overloaded for user types, and binary tilde operator is mostly used to merging two objects, or adding some objects to set of objects. It was introduced because plus operator can have different meaning in many situations. For example, what to do with "120" + "14" ? Is this a string "134" (addition of two numbers), or "12014" (concatenation of strings) or something else? D disallows + operator for arrays (and strings), and provides separate operator for concatenation (similarly [[PHP]] programming language solved this problem by using dot operator for concatenation, and + for number addition, which will also work on strings containing numbers).

In [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], the tilde is used for object comparison. If ''a'' and ''b'' denote objects, the boolean expression ''a'' ~ ''b'' has value true if and only if these objects are equal, as defined by the applicable version of the library routine ''is_equal'', which by default denotes field-by-field object equality but can be redefined in any class to support a specific notion of equality. If ''a'' and ''b'' are references, the object equality expression ''a'' ~ ''b'' is to be contrasted with ''a'' = ''b'' which denotes reference equality. Unlike the call ''a''.''is_equal'' (''b''), the expression ''a'' ~ ''b'' is [[type safety|type-safe]] even in the presence of [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariance]].

In the [[Groovy (programming language)|Apache Groovy programming language]] the tilde character is used as an operator mapped to the bitwiseNegate() method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groovy.codehaus.org/Operator%20Overloading|title=The Groovy programming language - Operators|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a String the method will produce a java.util.regex.Pattern. Given an integer it will negate the integer bitwise like in different C variants. &lt;code&gt;=~&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;==~&lt;/code&gt; can in Groovy be used to match a regular expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://groovy.codehaus.org/Regular+Expressions | title = Groovy Regular Expression User Guide | publisher = Code haus}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://groovy.codehaus.org/FAQ+-+RegExp | title = Groovy RegExp FAQ | publisher = Code haus}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], the tilde is used in type constraints to indicate type equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Type_families#Equality_constraints | title = Haskell Wiki | contribution = Type Families}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, in pattern-matching, the tilde is used to indicate a lazy pattern match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lazy_pattern_match|title=Lazy pattern match - HaskellWiki|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Inform]] programming language, the tilde is used to indicate a quotation mark inside a quoted string. &lt;!-- but what does it use to indicate a ~ inside a quoted string? --&gt;

In "text mode" of the [[LaTeX]] typesetting language a tilde diacritic can be obtained using, e.g., &lt;code&gt;\~{n}&lt;/code&gt;, yielding "ñ". A stand-alone tilde can be obtained by using &lt;code&gt;\textasciitilde&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\string~&lt;/code&gt;.
In "math mode" a tilde diacritic can be written as, e.g., &lt;code&gt;\tilde{x}&lt;/code&gt;. For a wider tilde &lt;code&gt;\widetilde&lt;/code&gt; can be used. The &lt;code&gt;\sim&lt;/code&gt; command produce a tilde-like binary relation symbol that is often used in mathematical expressions, and the double-tilde [[≈]] is obtained with &lt;code&gt;\approx&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; package also supports entering tildes directly, e.g., &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;\url{http://server/~name}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
In both text and math mode, a tilde on its own (&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;) renders a white space with no line breaking.

In [[MediaWiki]] [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]], four tildes are used as a shortcut for a user's signature.

In [[Common Lisp]], the tilde is used as the prefix for format specifiers in format strings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/22_c.htm |title=CLHS: Section 22.3 |publisher=Lispworks.com |date=2005-04-11 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Max/MSP]], a tilde is used to denote objects that process at the computer's sampling rate, i.e. mainly those that deal with sound.

In [[Standard ML]], the tilde is used as the prefix for negative numbers and as the unary negation operator.

In [[OCaml]], the tilde is used to specify the label for a labeled parameter.

In Microsoft's SQL Server [[Transact-SQL|Transact-SQL (T-SQL)]] language, the tilde is a unary [[Bitwise NOT#NOT|Bitwise NOT]] operator.

In [[JavaScript]], the tilde is used as a unary [[Bitwise operation#NOT|bitwise complement]] (or bitwise negation) operation (&lt;code&gt;~number&lt;/code&gt;). Because JavaScript internally uses floats and the bitwise complement only works on integers, numbers are stripped of their decimal part before applying the operation. This has also given rise to using two tildes &lt;code&gt;~~number&lt;/code&gt; as a short syntax for a cast to integer (numbers are stripped of their decimal part and changed into their complement, and then back. The net result is thus only the removal of the decimal part). For positive numbers, this is equivalent to the mathematical ''[[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]]'' function.

In [[Object REXX]], the twiddle is used as a "message send" symbol. For example, &lt;code&gt;Employee.name~lower()&lt;/code&gt; would cause the &lt;code&gt;lower()&lt;/code&gt; method to act on the object &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute, returning the result of the operation. &lt;code&gt;~~&lt;/code&gt; returns the object that received the method rather than the result produced. Thus it can be used when the result need not be returned or when cascading methods are to be used. &lt;code&gt;team~~insert("Jane")~~insert("Joe")~~insert("Steve")&lt;/code&gt; would send multiple concurrent &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt; messages, thus invoking the &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt; method three consecutive times on the &lt;code&gt;team&lt;/code&gt; object.

=== Backup filenames ===
The dominant [[Unix]] convention for naming backup copies of files is appending a tilde to the original file name.
It originated with the [[Emacs]] text editor&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Backup-Names.html#Backup-Names Emacs Manual]&lt;/ref&gt; and was adopted by many other editors and some command-line tools.

Emacs also introduced an elaborate numbered backup scheme, with files named {{mono|filename.~1~}}, {{mono|filename.~2~}} and so on.  It didn't catch on, as the rise of [[version control]] software eliminates the need for this usage.

=== Microsoft filenames ===
The tilde was part of [[Microsoft]]'s [[filename mangling]] scheme when it extended the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file system standard to support long filenames for [[Microsoft Windows]].  Programs written prior to this development could only access filenames in the so-called [[8.3 filename|8.3 format]]—the filenames consisted of a maximum of eight characters from a restricted character set (e.g. no spaces), followed by a period, followed by three more characters.  In order to permit these legacy programs to access files in the FAT file system, each file had to be given two names—one long, more descriptive one, and one that conformed to the 8.3 format.  This was accomplished with a name-mangling scheme in which the first six characters of the filename are followed by a tilde and a digit.  For example, "{{mono|Program Files}}" might become "{{mono|PROGRA~1}}".

The tilde symbol is also often used to prefix hidden temporary files that are created when a document is opened in Windows. For example, when a document "Document1.doc" is opened in Word, a file called "~$cument1.doc" is created in the same directory. This file contains information about which user has the file open, to prevent multiple users from attempting to change a document at the same time.

=== Other uses ===
[[Computer programmers]] use the tilde in various ways and sometimes call the symbol (as opposed to the diacritic) a '''squiggle''', '''squiggly''', or '''twiddle'''.  According to the [[Jargon File]], other synonyms sometimes used in programming include '''not''', '''approx''', '''wiggle''', '''enyay''' (after ''[[ñ|eñe]]'') and (humorously) '''sqiggle''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|ɪ|ɡ|əl}}.  It is used in many languages as a binary inversion operator, swapping a number's binary 1's and 0's for example ~10 (binary ~1010) is equal to 5 (binary 0101).

In [[Perl 6]], "&lt;nowiki&gt;~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;" is used instead of "[[=~]]".

==Juggling notation==
In the [[juggling notation]] system Beatmap, tilde can be added to either "hand" in a pair of fields to say "cross the arms with this hand on top". [[Mills Mess]] is thus represented as (~2x,1)(1,2x)(2x,~1)*.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jugglingdb.com/help/?id=125 | title=The Internet Juggling Database | archivedate=28 July 2005 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050728104414/http://www.jugglingdb.com/help/?id=125 | accessdate=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Keyboards==
Where a tilde is on the keyboard depends on the computer's language settings according to the following chart. On many keyboards it is primarily available through a [[dead key]] that makes it possible to produce a variety of [[precomposed character]]s with the diacritic.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} In that case, a single tilde can typically be inserted with the dead key followed by the space bar, or alternatively by striking the dead key twice in a row.

To insert a tilde with the dead key, it is often necessary to simultaneously hold down the [[Alt Gr]] key. On the keyboard layouts that include an ''Alt Gr'' key, it typically takes the place of the right-hand [[Alt key]]. With a [[Macintosh]] either of the Alt/[[Option key|Option]] keys function similarly.

In the US and European [[Windows]] systems, the [[Alt code]] for a single tilde is &lt;code&gt;126&lt;/code&gt;.

For Mac use option+'n' key

The '''unary numeral system''' is the [[Bijective numeration|bijective]] [[Radix|base]]-[[1 (number)|1]] [[numeral system]]. It is the simplest numeral system to represent [[natural number]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=One to Nine: The Inner Life of Numbers|first=Andrew|last=Hodges|publisher=Anchor Canada|year=2009|isbn=9780385672665|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UCuwrtBax7AC&amp;pg=PA14|quote=The simplest way to write the natural numbers is by the unary notation}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to represent a number ''N'', an arbitrarily chosen symbol representing 1 is repeated ''N'' times.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Computability, Complexity, and Languages: Fundamentals of Theoretical Computer Science|first1=Martin|last1=Davis|first2=Ron|last2=Sigal|first3=Elaine J.|last3=Weyuker|edition=2nd|publisher=Academic Press|year=1994|series=Computer Science and Scientific Computing|isbn=9780122063824|page=117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRWOqKwZGRAC&amp;pg=PA117|quote=the base 1 (or unary) representation of the number {{mvar|x}} is simply a string of ones of length {{mvar|x}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... would be represented in this system as&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=33|title=Programming Structures: Machines and programs|volume=1|series=Programming Structures|first=Jan|last=Hext|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1990|isbn=9780724809400}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111, ...
These numbers should be distinguished from [[repunit]]s, which are also written as sequences of ones but have their usual [[decimal]] numerical interpretation.

This system is used in [[tally mark|tallying]]. For example, using the tally mark '''&amp;#124;''', the number 3 is represented as '''&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;'''. In [[East Asia]]n cultures, the number three is represented as “[[wikt:三#Translingual|三]]” (1 and 2 are represented the same way), a character that is drawn with three strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=16|issue=8–9|pages=125–133|first=Charles E.|last=Woodruff|title=The evolution of modern numerals from ancient tally marks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JggPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125|doi=10.2307/2970818|year=1909|jstor=2970818}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Addition]] and [[subtraction]] are particularly simple in the unary system, as they involve little more than [[string concatenation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Complexity==
Compared to standard [[Positional notation|positional numeral systems]], the unary system is inconvenient and hence is not used in practice for large calculations. It occurs in some [[decision problem]] descriptions in [[theory of computation|theoretical computer science]] (e.g. some [[P-complete]] problems), where it is used to "artificially" decrease the run-time or space requirements of a problem. For instance, the problem of [[integer factorization]] is suspected to require more than a polynomial function of the length of the input as run-time if the input is given in [[binary numeral system|binary]], but it only needs linear runtime if the input is presented in unary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Using a unary input is slower for any given number, not faster; the distinction is that a binary (or larger base) input is proportional to the base 2 (or larger base) logarithm of the number while unary input is proportional to the number itself. Therefore, while the run-time and space requirement in unary looks better as function of the input size, it does not represent a more efficient solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Nature of Computation|first1=Cristopher|last1=Moore|author1-link=Cristopher Moore|first2=Stephan|last2=Mertens|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780199233212|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4zMiZyAE1kC&amp;pg=PA29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computational complexity theory]], unary numbering is used to distinguish [[strongly NP-complete]] problems from problems that are [[NP-complete]] but not strongly NP-complete. A problem in which the input includes some numerical parameters is strongly NP-complete if it remains NP-complete even when the size of the input is made artificially larger by representing the parameters in unary. For such a problem, there exist hard instances for which all parameter values are at most polynomially large.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Thus, it is closely related to the theorem of {{harvtxt|Euler|1736}} that a finite graph has an [[Euler tour]] (a single non-simple cycle that covers the edges of the graph) if and only if it is [[connected graph|connected]] and every vertex has even degree. Indeed, a representation of a graph as a union of simple cycles may be obtained from an Euler tour by repeatedly splitting the tour into smaller cycles whenever there is a repeated vertex. However, Veblen's theorem applies also to disconnected graphs, and can be generalized to [[infinite graph]]s in which every vertex has finite degree {{harv|Sabidussi|1964}}.

If a countably infinite graph ''G'' has no odd-degree vertices, then it may be written as a union of disjoint (finite) simple cycles if and only if every finite subgraph of ''G'' can be extended (by adding more edges and vertices of ''G'') to a finite Eulerian graph. In particular, every countably infinite graph with only one [[end (graph theory)|end]] and with no odd vertices can be written as a union of disjoint cycles {{harv|Sabidussi|1964}}.

A '''Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) auction''' is a type of sealed-bid auction of multiple items. Bidders submit bids that report their valuations for the items, without knowing the bids of the other bidders. The auction system assigns the items in a [[socially optimal]] manner: it charges each individual the harm they cause to other bidders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = von Ahn | first = Luis | authorlink = Luis von Ahn | coauthors =  | title = Sponsored Search | work = 15–396: Science of the Web Course Notes | publisher = Carnegie Mellon University | date = 2011-10-13 | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150306210734/http://server251.theory.cs.cmu.edu/15-396/lectures_f11/lecture12.pdf | format = PDF | doi = | accessdate = 2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives bidders [[Incentive compatibility|an incentive to bid their true valuations]], by ensuring that the optimal strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuations of the items. It is a generalization of a [[Vickrey auction]] for multiple items.

The auction is named after [[William Vickrey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Counterspeculation, Auctions, and Competitive Sealed Tenders | author=Vickrey, William | journal=The Journal of Finance | year=1961 | volume=16 | issue=1 | pages=8–37 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1961.tb02789.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward H. Clarke]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clarke, E. | year=1971 | title=Multipart Pricing of Public Goods | journal=Public Choice | volume=11 | issue=1 | pages=17–33 | doi=10.1007/bf01726210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Theodore Groves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Incentives in Teams | author=Groves, T. | journal=Econometrica | year=1973 | volume=41 | issue=4 | pages=617–631 | doi=10.2307/1914085| jstor=1914085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for their papers that successively generalized the idea.

The VCG auction is a specific use of the more general [[Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism|VCG Mechanism]]. While the VCG auction tries to make a socially optimal allocation of items, VCG mechanisms allow for the selection of a socially optimal outcome out of a set of possible outcomes.

== Intuitive description==

Consider an auction where a set of identical products are being sold. Bidders can take part in the auction by announcing the maximum price they are willing to pay to receive N products. Each buyer is allowed to declare more than one bid, since its [[willingness-to-pay]] per unit might be different depending on the total number of units it receives. Bidders cannot see other people's bids at any moment since they are sealed (only visible to the auction system). Once all the bids are made, the auction is closed.

All the possible combinations of bids are then considered by the auction system, and the one maximizing the total sum of bids is kept, with the condition that it does not exceed the total amount of products available and that at most one bid from each bidder can be used. Bidders who have made a successful bid then receive the product quantity specified in their bid. The price they pay in exchange, however, is not the amount they had bid initially but only the marginal harm their bid has caused to other bidders (which is at most as high as their original bid).

This marginal harm caused to other participants (i.e. the final price paid by each individual with a successful bid) can be calculated as: (sum of bids of the auction from the second best combination of bids) - (what other bidders have bid in the current (best) combination of bids). If the sum of bids of the second best combination of bids is the same as that of the best combination, then the price paid by the buyers will be the same as their initial bid. In all other cases, the price paid by the buyers will be lower.

At the end of the auction, the total utility has been maximized since all the goods have been attributed to the people with the highest combined willingness-to-pay. If agents are fully rational and in the absence of collusion, we can assume that the willingness to pay have been reported truthfully since only the marginal harm to other bidders will be charged to each participant, making [[Incentive compatibility|truthful reporting]] a weakly-[[dominant strategy]]. This type of auction, however, will not maximize the seller's revenue unless the sum of bids of the second best combination of bids is equal to the sum of bids of the best combination of bids.

== Formal description==
; Notation
For any set of auctioned items &lt;math&gt;M = \{t_1,\ldots,t_m\}&lt;/math&gt; and any set of bidders &lt;math&gt;N = \{b_1,\ldots,b_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;V^M_N&lt;/math&gt; be the social value of the VCG auction for a given bid-combination. That is, how much each person values the items they've just won, added up across everyone. The value of the item is zero if they do not win. For a bidder &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; and item &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt;, let the bidder's bid for the item be &lt;math&gt;v_{i}(t_{j})&lt;/math&gt;. The notation &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B&lt;/math&gt; means the [[set-theoretic difference|set of elements of A which are not elements of B]].
; Assignment
A bidder &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; whose bid for an item &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; is an "overbid", namely &lt;math&gt;v_{i}(t_{j})&lt;/math&gt;, wins the item, but pays &lt;math&gt;V^{M}_{N \setminus \{b_i\}}-V^{M \setminus \{t_j\}}_{N \setminus \{b_i\}}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the social cost of their winning that is incurred by the rest of the agents.
; Explanation
Indeed, the set of bidders other than &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;N \setminus \{b_i\}&lt;/math&gt;. When item &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; is available, they could attain welfare &lt;math&gt;V^{M}_{N \setminus \{b_i\}}.&lt;/math&gt; The winning of the item by &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; reduces the set of available items to &lt;math&gt;M \setminus \{t_j\}&lt;/math&gt;, however, so that the attainable welfare is now &lt;math&gt;V^{M \setminus \{t_j\}}_{N \setminus \{b_i\}}&lt;/math&gt;. The difference between the two levels of welfare is therefore the loss in attainable welfare suffered by the rest of the bidders, as predicted, '''given''' the winner &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; got the item &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt;. This quantity depends on the offers of the rest of the agents and is unknown to agent &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;.
; Winner's utility
''The winning bidder whose bid is the true value &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; for the item &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_{i}(t_{j})=A,&lt;/math&gt; derives maximum utility &lt;math&gt;A - \left(V^{M}_{N \setminus \{b_i\}}-V^{M \setminus \{t_j\}}_{N \setminus \{b_i\}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;''

==Examples==

===Two items, three bidders===
Suppose two apples are being auctioned among three bidders.
* Bidder A wants one apple and is willing to pay $5 for that apple.
* Bidder B wants one apple and is willing to pay $2 for it.
* Bidder C wants two apples and is willing to pay $6 to have both of them but is uninterested in buying only one without the other.

First, the outcome of the auction is determined by maximizing bids: the apples go to bidder A and bidder B, since their combined bid of $5 + $2 = $7 is greater than the bid for two apples by bidder C who is willing to pay only $6. Thus, after the auction, the value achieved by bidder A is $5, by bidder B is $2, and by bidder C is $0 (since bidder C gets nothing). Note that the determination of winners is essentially a [[knapsack problem]].

Next, the formula for deciding payments gives:
* For bidder '''A''': The payment for winning required of A is determined by the difference in two alternative auctions. First, in an auction for both apples that excludes bidder A, the social-welfare maximizing outcome would assign both apples to bidder C for a total social value of $6. In the more limited alternative of an auction for only one apple that excludes bidder A, the social-welfare maximizing outcome assigns the apple to bidder B for $2, as C is uninterested in only one apple. Thus, the payment required of A is $6&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;$2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;$4. 
* For bidder '''B''': Similar to the above, the best outcome for an auction for both apples that excludes bidder B assigns both apples to bidder C for $6. In an auction for only one apple, the best outcome assigns the apple to bidder A for $5. Thus, the payment required of B is $6&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;$5&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;$1.
* Finally, the payment for bidder C is (($5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;$2)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;($5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;$2))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;$0.

After the auction, A is $1 better off than before (paying $4 to gain $5 of utility), B is $1 better off than before (paying $1 to gain $2 of utility), and C is neutral (having not won anything).

===Two bidders===
Assume that there are two bidders, &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt;, two items, &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;, and each bidder is allowed to obtain one item. We let &lt;math&gt;v_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; be bidder &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;'s valuation for item &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt;. Assume &lt;math&gt;v_{1,1} = 10&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_{1,2} = 5&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_{2,1} = 5&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;v_{2,2} = 3&lt;/math&gt;. We see that both &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; would prefer to receive item &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;; however, the socially optimal assignment gives item &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; to bidder &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; (so their achieved value is &lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt;) and item &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; to bidder &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; (so their achieved value is &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;). Hence, the total achieved value is &lt;math&gt;13&lt;/math&gt;, which is optimal.

If person &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; were not in the auction, person &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; would still be assigned to &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;, and hence person &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; can gain nothing. The current outcome is &lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt; hence &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; is charged &lt;math&gt;10-10=0&lt;/math&gt;.

If person &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; were not in the auction, &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; would be assigned to &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt;, and would have valuation &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;. The current outcome is 3 hence &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; is charged &lt;math&gt;5-3=2&lt;/math&gt;.

A multiple item auction with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; bidders, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; houses, and values &lt;math&gt;\tilde v_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, representing the value player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; has for house &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. Possible outcomes are characterized by [[Matching (graph theory)|bipartite matchings]], pairing houses with people.
If we know the values, then maximizing social welfare reduces to computing a maximum weight bipartite matching.

If we do not know the values, then we instead solicit bids &lt;math&gt;\tilde b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, asking each player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; how much they would wish to bid for house &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;.
Define &lt;math&gt;b_i(a) = \tilde b_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; if bidder &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; receives house &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in the matching &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Now compute &lt;math&gt;a^*&lt;/math&gt;, a maximum weight
bipartite matching with respect to the bids, and compute

:  &lt;math&gt;p_i = \left[ \max_{a \in A} \sum_{j \neq i} b_j(a) \right] - \sum_{j \neq i} b_j(a^*) &lt;/math&gt;.

The first term is another max weight bipartite matching, and the second term can be computed easily from &lt;math&gt;a^*&lt;/math&gt;.

==Optimality of truthful bidding==

The following is a proof that bidding one's true valuations for the auctioned items is optimal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~arielpro/15896/docs/notes14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For each bidder &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; be their true valuation of an item &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;, and suppose ([[without loss of generality]]) that &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; wins &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; upon submitting their true valuations.
Then the net utility &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; attained by &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; is given by their own valuation of the item they've won, minus the price they've paid: 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U_i &amp;= v_i-\left(V^{M}_{N \setminus \{b_i\}}-V^{M \setminus \{t_i\}}_{N \setminus \{b_i\}}\right) \\
&amp;=\sum_{j}v_j-\sum_{j\neq i}v_j+V^{M\setminus \{t_i\}}_{N\setminus \{b_i\}}-V^M_{N\setminus\{b_i\}} \\
&amp;=\sum_j v_j-V^{M\setminus \{t_i\}}_{N\setminus \{b_i\}}+V^{M\setminus \{t_i\}}_{N\setminus \{b_i\}}-V^M_{N\setminus\{b_i\}} \\
&amp;=\sum_j v_j-V^M_{N\setminus\{b_i\}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;. 

As &lt;math&gt;V^M_{N\setminus\{b_i\}}&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;, the maximization of net utility is pursued by the mechanism along with the maximization of corporate gross utility &lt;math&gt;\sum_j v_j&lt;/math&gt; for the declared bid &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;.

To make it clearer, let us form the difference &lt;math&gt;U_i - U_j = \left[v_i + V^{M \setminus \{t_i\}}_{N \setminus \{b_i\}}\right] - \left[v_j + V^{M \setminus \{t_j\}}_{N \setminus \{b_i\}}\right] &lt;/math&gt; between net utility &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; under truthful bidding &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; gotten item &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;, and net utility &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; of bidder &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; under non-truthful bidding &lt;math&gt;v'_i&lt;/math&gt; for item &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; gotten item &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; on true utility &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\left[v_j + V^{M \setminus \{t_j\}}_{N \setminus \{b_i\}}\right] &lt;/math&gt; is the corporate gross utility obtained with the non-truthful bidding. But the allocation assigning &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; is different from the allocation assigning &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; which gets maximum (true) gross corporate utility. Hence &lt;math&gt;\left[v_i + V^{M \setminus \{t_i\}}_{N \setminus \{b_i\}}\right] - \left[v_j + V^{M \setminus \{t_j\}}_{N \setminus \{b_i\}}\right]\geq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_i\geq U_j&lt;/math&gt; q.e.d.
