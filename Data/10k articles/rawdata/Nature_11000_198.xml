'''{{mp|2014 SC|324}}''' is a sub-kilometer [[asteroid]] and [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fast rotator]], classified as a [[near-Earth object]] of the  [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately 50 meters in diameter.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; It was first observed on 30 September 2014, by the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] at an [[apparent magnitude]] of 21 using a {{convert|1.5|m|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[reflecting telescope]].&lt;ref name="MPEC2014-T10"/&gt; With an [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude]] of 24.3,&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; the asteroid is about 37–85&amp;nbsp;meters in diameter.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

== Description ==

The preliminary orbit with a short [[observation arc]] of 2 days showed that the asteroid had a very small chance of passing {{convert|0.000125|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from the Moon or {{convert|0.0012|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth on about 23 October 2014.&lt;ref name="archive141002"/&gt; But with an observation arc of 10 days, the [[Curve fitting|nominal]] (best fit) orbit showed that on 24 October 2014 the asteroid would pass {{convert|0.0038|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} (1.5 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|LD]]) from Earth and even further from the Moon.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; The asteroid peaked at [[apparent magnitude]] 13.5,&lt;ref name="NEODyS2014"/&gt; placing it in the range of amateurs with roughly {{convert|0.25|m|in|0|adj=on|sp=us}} telescopes.

It was removed from the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] on 10 October 2014 using JPL solution #5 with a 10-day observation arc.&lt;ref name="removed"/&gt;

It was observed by [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] [[radar astronomy|radar]] on 24–25 October 2014.&lt;ref name="Goldstone"/&gt;

'''{{mp|2017 VW|13}}''' (also written [[Astronomical naming conventions#Minor planets|2017 VW13]]) is an [[List of Apollo asteroids|Apollo]] [[near-Earth asteroid]] roughly {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter. It was discovered on 13 November 2017 when the asteroid was about {{convert|0.069|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth and had a [[solar elongation]] of 110 degrees. Ten days earlier, on 3 November 2017, the asteroid had passed {{convert|0.02818|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} from Earth,&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; but only had a solar elongation of 65 degrees.

== 2001 Earth approach ==
Calculating the orbit backwards it is known that the asteroid made a close approach to Earth on 8 November 2001.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; The nominal ([[best-fit]]) solution shows that the asteroid passed about {{convert|0.001|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} from Earth. But due to the uncertainties in the trajectory, the asteroid could have passed as far as {{convert|0.008|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} from Earth. As the observation arc becomes longer the precise distance of the 2001 approach will become better constrained.

The Alberta Energy Regulator "regulates approximately 181,000 active wells, more than 50,000 oil and gas facilities, and {{convert|415,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of pipelines."&lt;ref name="What we do"&gt;{{cite web|title=What we do|url=http://www.aer.ca/about-aer/what-we-do|website=Alberta Energy Regulator|publisher=Alberta Energy Regulator|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AER also "considers some 36,800 applications for [[energy development]] every year."&lt;ref name=AERbrochure2013 /&gt;

==History==
Energy regulation in Alberta has a 76-year history, evolving over time to meet changing technologies and public needs. Following its creation in 1938&lt;ref name=Steward&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaremko|first1=Gordon|title=Steward|date=2013|publisher=Energy Resources Conservation Board|location=Calgary, Canada|isbn=978-0-9918734-0-1|edition=1|url=http://www.aer.ca/documents/about-us/Steward_Ebook.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board, the regulatory body has consistently overseen energy development in the province. It has existed under several names throughout its history, including the '''Alberta Oil and Gas Conservation Board''', the '''Alberta Energy and Utilities Board''', and the '''Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board'''. The Alberta Energy Regulator builds off of this legacy, but it is, under the ''Responsible Energy Development Act,'' an entirely new organization with new regulatory functions and authority over energy-related applications and developments.

=== Responsible Energy Development Act ===
In December 2012, the [http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/r17p3.pdf ''Responsible Energy Development Act'']&lt;ref name=RespEnergydec2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/r17p3.pdf|format=PDF|title=Responsible Energy Development Act|date=10 December 2012|publisher=Government of Alberta|location=Edmonton, Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed in the Alberta Legislature as part of the Regulatory Enhancement Project. The ''REDA'' made the Alberta Energy Regulator "responsible for all projects from application to reclamation," with "the authority to administer the [[Public Lands Act]], the [[Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act]] and the [[Water Act]], with regards to energy development."&lt;ref name=GovABjune2013 /&gt; The Alberta Energy Regulator was phased in over nine months beginning in June 2013.&lt;ref name=GovABjune2013 /&gt; In March 2014, the Alberta Energy Regulator became the single regulator for energy development in Alberta; it now enforces environmental laws and issues environmental and water permits for energy developments, which were formerly responsibilities of Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development.&lt;ref name=Pratt18June2013AER /&gt;

==Responsibilities==

The Alberta Energy Regulator "ensures the safe, efficient, orderly, and environmentally responsible development of hydrocarbon resources over their entire life cycle. This includes allocating and conserving water resources, managing [[public lands]], and  [[environmental protection]] while providing economic benefits for all Albertans."&lt;ref name=AERbrochure2013&gt;{{cite web|title=The Alberta Energy Regulator |url=http://www.aer.ca/documents/about-us/AER_Brochure.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) |year=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421082116/http://www.aer.ca/documents/about-us/AER_Brochure.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marketwire22June2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/alberta-energy-regulator-operations-continue-during-southern-alberta-floods-1804731.htm|date=22 June 2013|title=Alberta Energy Regulator Operations Continue During Southern Alberta Floods|location=Calgary, Alberta|publisher=Marketwired}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hydrocarbon resources are among the world's largest reserves at 167 billion barrels of [[bitumen]] and [[crude oil]], 33.7 trillion cubic feet of [[natural gas]], and 37 billion tons of coal.&lt;ref name="EnerFAQs What is the Alberta Energy Regulator"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Alberta Energy Regulator|url=http://www.aer.ca/compliance-and-enforcement/enerfaqs/enerfaqs-01|website=Alberta Energy Regulator|publisher=Alberta Energy Regulator|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alberta Energy Regulator also regulates the infrastructure associated with these reserves, including a provincial pipeline network of 415,000 kilometres (km), over 181,000 operating wells, more than 50,000 oil and gas facilities, over 200 thermal oil sands projects, 9 oil sands mines, 11 coal mines, and 4 coal processing plants.&lt;ref name="EnerFAQs What is the Alberta Energy Regulator"/&gt;

The Government of Alberta has granted the AER authority to review and make decisions on proposed [[energy developments]], to oversee all aspects of [[energy resource]] activities in accordance with government policies, to regularly inspect energy activities to ensure that all applicable requirements are met, to penalize companies that fail to comply with AER requirements, and to hold hearings on proposed energy developments. As the single regulator, it is responsible for all energy-related applications under the ''Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act'', the ''Water Act'', the ''Public Lands Act'', and the ''Mines and Minerals Act''. The AER also responds to concerns from landowners, First Nations, industry, and other stakeholders regarding energy regulations in Alberta and mediates disputes surrounding energy projects.

In the past the Energy Resources Conservation Board and [[Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development]] (formerly [[Alberta Environment]]) conducted investigations separately, but, with the creation of a single regulatory body for energy developments, the Alberta Energy Regulator now conducts investigations and inspections to ensure compliance with all regulatory, environmental, and safety requirements.&lt;ref name="EnerFAQs Inspections and Enforcement of Energy Developments in Alberta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inspections and Enforcement of Energy Developments in Alberta |url=http://www.aer.ca/compliance-and-enforcement/enerfaqs/enerfaqs-inspections-and-enforcement-of-energy-developments-in-alberta |website=Alberta Energy Regulator |publisher=Alberta Energy Regulator |accessdate=3 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606205103/http://www.aer.ca/compliance-and-enforcement/enerfaqs/enerfaqs-inspections-and-enforcement-of-energy-developments-in-alberta |archivedate=6 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AER can enforce industry compliance with regulations using tools that include more frequent and detailed inspections, more stringent planning requirements, enforcement orders, shutting down operations, administrative penalties,&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Fines under the [http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/r17p3.pdf Responsible Energy Development Act] are limited to $500,000 or less for a corporation and $50,000 or less for an individual.&lt;/ref&gt; and prosecution. The AER regularly posts details of compliance activities on the [http://www.aer.ca AER website], which also includes copies of all investigation reports.

Since the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) was succeeded by AER, as part of their succession title pages of all existing ERCB directives such as Directive 074 regarding [[oil sands tailings ponds]] performance dated 3 February 2009, now carry the AER logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Directive 074: Tailings Performance Criteria and Requirements for Oil Sands Mining Schemes |date=3 February 2009 |work=AER}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance structure==
The AER's governance structure uses a corporate-style system to "achieve benefits of both strong corporate oversight and independent adjudication."&lt;ref name=Governance&gt;{{cite web|title=Governance|url=http://www.aer.ca/about-aer/governance|website=Alberta Energy Regulator|publisher=Alberta Energy Regulator|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the board of directors determines the general direction of the regulator rather than overseeing the AER's day-to-day operations and decisions — these are the responsibility of the chief executive officer. The CEO receives and makes decisions on applications, monitors and investigates energy resource activities for compliance, and oversees the closure of energy developments, including reclamation and remediation of the land.

Hearing commissioners constitute another part of the AER's structure. They conduct all hearings into energy applications and regulatory appeals, in addition to helping to develop the organization's hearing procedures and rules as well as other day-to-day operations. Hearing commissioners are independent adjudicators, and their decisions may only be reviewed by the Court of Appeal of Alberta.&lt;ref name="EnerFAQs What is the Alberta Energy Regulator"/&gt;

AER chair, Gerry Protti was a former executive with Encana, the founding president of the [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP), and a long-time lobbyist for the [[Energy Policy Institute of Canada]]. The appointment was met with calls for his resignation as he was seen to be biased in favour of industry.&lt;ref name=Pratt18June2013AER&gt;{{cite news|title=Critics want Alberta's new energy regulator removed |date=18 June 2013 |work=Edmonton Journal |first=Sheila |last=Pratt |url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/Critics+condemn+Alberta+energy+regulator/8330118/story.html#ixzz2X5Jj2uZW |accessdate=22 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522024930/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/Critics%2Bcondemn%2BAlberta%2Benergy%2Bregulator/8330118/story.html |archivedate=22 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's governance structure, however, delegates decisions on contested applications and developments to the hearing commissioners, with the chair heading a board of directors tasked with setting performance expectations and approving regulatory change.&lt;ref name="Governance"/&gt; Jim Ellis, a former deputy minister in environment and energy, was appointed as CEO by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.&lt;ref name=AERbrochure2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pratt18June2013AER /&gt;&lt;ref name=ABjune2013&gt;{{cite web|date=12 June 2013|title=Strong team leads Alberta Energy Regulator|publisher=Government of Alberta|location=Edmonton, Alberta|url=http://alberta.ca/acn/201306/343223905E4CD-CB74-5432-4E114A5BFDDE7583.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
The Alberta Energy Regulator is 100 per cent funded by industry and is authorized to collect funds through an administrative fee levied on oil and gas wells, oil sands mines, and coal mines. The industry-funded model is commonly used by regulatory agencies from various sectors across North America, such as the Alberta Utilities Commission and the BC Oil and Gas Commission.&lt;ref name=AERbrochure2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="EnerFAQs What is the Alberta Energy Regulator"/&gt; Its budget is established through a formal process between the Government of Alberta's Treasury Board and the AER, and the budget must be approved by the Government of Alberta. The AER has an annual budget of more than $165 million and more than 1200 staff working in 15 locations across Alberta.&lt;ref name=AERbrochure2013 /&gt;

==2014==
Gerry Protti, provided an overview of AER's first year in operation beginning April 2014, to one hundred participants at Green Regs &amp; Ham in Calgary hosted by the Environmental Law Centre and sponsored by Devon Canada and Cenovus Energy.&lt;ref name="ELC_2014"&gt;{{citation |url=http://elc.ab.ca/calgary-likes-green-regs-ham/ |date=5 June 2014 |title=Calgary likes Green Regs &amp; Ham! |first=Brenda Heelan |last=Powell |accessdate=10 March 2015|work=Environmental Law Centre (Alberta) |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protti described AER's "holistic approach" to oil and gas development and regulation under Alberta's Water Act and Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act, the "adoption of "play-based" regulation, which focuses on regulating the surface and subsurface of a particular formation (as opposed to the traditional one well-one licence approach); use of a performance-based approach to regulate outcomes, which includes managing cumulative effects, minimizing spread of surface infrastructure, and conserving and managing water; and increased planning and collaboration among companies and community stakeholders."&lt;ref name="ELC_2014" /&gt; During question period Protti admitted "despite working hard on it over the past year, the AER could have communicated better with the public."&lt;ref name="ELC_2014" /&gt;

==2015==
During the 2015 [[IHS Inc.]] [[CERAWeek]], [[Rex Tillerson]], Chairman and CEO of [[ExxonMobil]], the world's biggest energy company, praised Alberta's province's regulatory process for bringing critical regulatory "functions under one umbrella...[the AER]...decreasing duplication and costs and increasing efficiency." Tillerson argued that the U.S. energy policy has not "kept up with rapid changes in the sector."&lt;ref name="T-Rex_2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/canadian-energy-oversight-wins-high-praise |work=Calgary Herald |title=Canadian energy oversight wins high praise |first=Deborah |last=Yedlin |date=22 April 2015 |accessdate=22 April 2015 |location=Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
In March 2013, critics expressed concern that the AER would lead to less transparency in the regulation of the oil, gas and coal industry and would weaken environmental protection.&lt;ref name="Pratt8Mar13AER"&gt;{{cite news|title=New energy regulator will weaken environmental protection, say critics|date=17 March 2013 |accessdate=8 March 2015 |work=Edmonton Journal|first=Sheila|last=Pratt|url=http://www.albertalandownerscouncil.com/March%2017,%202013,%20Edmonton%20Journal-New%20energy%20regulator%20will%20weaken%20environmental%20protection.pdf |format=PDF |location=Edmonton, AB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy Minister Ken Hughes argued that the Policy Management Office would oversee AER when it takes over from Environment and Sustainable Resource Development (ESRD) in issuing permits related to water and to the environment. The [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP) welcomes the change that will streamline access to water and environmental permits for oil companies, by creating a one-stop-shop with "much needed clarity". Rachel Notley, the New Democrat's environment critic, expressed concern that the security of water and the environment would be compromised if the all decisions relating to development in the energy sector—including oil, gas and coal—are regulated under the AER, which is entirely funded by these industries. Prior to Bill 2, the Responsible Energy Development Act, the Alberta Environment regulated these permits under three provincial laws, the Water Act, the Public Lands Act, and the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act.&lt;ref name="Pratt8Mar13AER" /&gt;

A '''bioindicator''' is any [[species]] (an '''indicator species''') or group of species whose function, population, or status can reveal the qualitative status of the environment. For example, [[copepod]]s and other small water [[crustacean]]s that are present in many [[water body |water bodies]] can be monitored for changes (biochemical, [[physiological]], or [[behavioural]]) that may indicate a problem within their ecosystem. Bioindicators can tell us about the cumulative effects of different [[pollution |pollutants]] in the ecosystem and about how long a problem may have been present, which [[Water pollution#Measurement |physical and chemical testing]] cannot.&lt;ref name="Karr"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=James R. |year=1981 |title=Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities |journal=Fisheries |volume=6 |issue= 6 |pages=21–27 |url= |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1981)006&lt;0021:AOBIUF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1548-8446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''biological monitor''' or '''biomonitor''' is an [[organism]] that provides [[quantitative property |quantitative]] information on the quality of [[Environment (biophysical) |the environment]] around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.water.ncsu.edu/watershedss/info/biomon.html |title=Biomonitoring |author=NCSU Water Quality Group |website=WATERSHEDSS: A Decision Support System for Nonpoint Source Pollution Control |publisher=North Carolina State University |location=Raleigh, NC |access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a good biomonitor will indicate the presence of the pollutant and also attempt to provide additional information about the amount and intensity of the exposure.

A '''biological indicator''' is also the name given to a process for assessing the sterility of an environment through the use of resistant microorganism strains (eg. ''[[Bacillus]]'' or ''[[Geobacillus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.protakscientific.com/biological-indicators |title=Biological ind |author=Protak Scientific |website=Protak Scientific |publisher=Protak Scientific |location=United Kingdom |access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological indicators can be described as the introduction of a highly resistant microorganisms to a given environment before [[sterilization (microbiology) |sterilization]], tests are conducted to measure the effectiveness of the sterilization processes. As biological indicators use highly resistant [[microorganisms]], you can be assured that any sterilization process that renders them inactive will have also killed off more common, weaker [[pathogens]].
==Overview==
A bioindicator is an organism or biological response that reveals the presence of the pollutants by the occurrence of typical symptoms or measurable responses and is, therefore, more [[qualitative data |qualitative]]. 
These organisms (or communities of organisms) deliver information on alterations in the environment or the quantity of environmental [[pollutant]]s by changing in one of the following ways: [[physiological]]ly, [[chemical]]ly or [[behavioural]]ly.  
The information can be deduced through the study of:

# their content of certain [[Chemical element |element]]s or [[Chemical compound |compound]]s
# their [[Morphology (biology) |morphological]] or [[Cell (biology) |cellular structure]]
# [[metabolic]] [[biochemical]] processes
# behaviour
# population structure(s)

The importance and relevance of biomonitors, rather than man-made equipment, is justified by the observation that the best indicator of the status of a species or system is itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tingey |first1=David T. |year=1989 |title=Bio indicators in Air Pollution Research – Applications and Constraints |journal=Biologic Markers of Air-Pollution Stress and Damage in Forests. |pages=73–80 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1414&amp;page=73 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-07833-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioindicators can reveal indirect biotic effects of pollutants when many physical or chemical measurements cannot. Through bioindicators, scientists need to observe only the single indicating species to check on the environment rather than monitor the whole community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1538-bioindicators |title=Bioindicators |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2015-02-10 |website=Science Learning Hub |publisher=The University of Waikato, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a biomonitor is described as [[Biomonitoring |biological monitoring]] and is the use of the properties of an organism to obtain information on certain aspects of the biosphere. Biomonitoring of air pollutants can be passive or active. Passive methods observe plants growing naturally within the area of interest. Active methods detect the presence of air pollutants by placing test plants of known response and [[genotype]] into the study area.

[[Bioaccumulation |Bioaccumulative]] indicators are frequently regarded as biomonitors. Depending on the organism selected and their use, there are several types of bio-indicators.&lt;ref name="bioportal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biobasics.gc.ca/english/View.asp?x=740 |author=Government of Canada |accessdate= |title=Biobasics: bio-indicatorrs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003162258/http://www.biobasics.gc.ca/english/View.asp?x=740 |archivedate=October 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chessman&gt;{{cite book |title=SIGNAL 2 – A Scoring System for Macro-invertebrate ('Water Bugs') in Australian Rivers |last=Chessman |first=Bruce |authorlink= |year=2003 |series=Monitoring River Heath Initiative Technical Report no. 31 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia, Department of the Environment and Heritage |location=Canberra |isbn=0642548978 |page= |pages= |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/water/publications/environmental/rivers/nrhp/pubs/signal.pdf |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913163911/http://www.environment.gov.au/water/publications/environmental/rivers/nrhp/pubs/signal.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant indicators==
[[File:Lobaria pulmonaria 010108c.jpg|thumb|The lichen ''[[Lobaria pulmonaria]]'' is sensitive to air pollution.]]

The presence or absence of certain plant or other vegetative life in an ecosystem can provide important clues about the health of the environment: [[environmental preservation]]. There are several types of plant biomonitors, including [[moss]]es, [[lichen]]s, [[Bark (botany) |tree bark]], [[bark pocket]]s, [[tree ring]]s, and [[leaf |leaves]]. Fungi too may be useful as indicators.

Lichens are organisms comprising both fungi and [[algae]]. They are found on rocks and tree trunks, and they respond to environmental changes in forests, including changes in forest structure – [[conservation biology]], [[air pollution |air quality]], and climate. The disappearance of lichens in a forest may indicate environmental stresses, such as high levels of [[sulfur dioxide]], sulfur-based pollutants, and [[nitrogen oxide]]s.
The composition and total biomass of algal species in aquatic systems serve as an important metric for organic [[water pollution]] and nutrient loading such as nitrogen and phosphorus.
There are [[genetically engineered]] organisms that can respond to [[toxicity]] levels in the [[Environment (biophysical) |environment]]; ''e.g.'', a type of genetically engineered grass that grows a different colour if there are toxins in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1565508,00.html#ixzz0geEjnTG1 |title=Saving Lives And Limbs With a Weed |last=Halper |first=Mark |date=2006-12-03 |newspaper=Time |access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal indicators and toxins==

Changes in animal [[population biology |populations]], whether increases or decreases, can indicate [[pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |first1=Jeffrey D. |last1=Grabarkiewicz |first2=Wayne S. |last2=Davis |date=November 2008  |title=An Introduction to Freshwater Fishes As Biological Indicators |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P1002J1W.TXT |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-260-R-08-016 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if pollution causes depletion of a plant, animal species that depend on that plant will experience [[population decline]]. Conversely, [[overpopulation (biology) |overpopulation]] may be opportunistic growth of a species in response to loss of other species in an ecosystem. On the other hand, [[Stress (biology) |stress]]-induced [[Sublethal |sub-lethal]] effects can me manifested in animal [[physiology]], [[Morphology (biology) |morphology]], and [[Behavioral ecology |behaviour]] of individuals long before responses are expressed and observed at the population level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Beaulieu |first=Michaël |last2=Costantini |first2=David |date=2014-01-01 |title=Biomarkers of oxidative status: missing tools in conservation physiology |url=https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/2/1/cou014/327234/Biomarkers-of-oxidative-status-missing-tools-in |journal=Conservation Physiology |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1093/conphys/cou014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such sub-lethal responses can be very useful as "early warning signals" to predict how population will further respond. 

Pollution and other stress agents can be monitored by measuring any of several variables in animals: the concentration of [[toxin]]s in animal tissues; the rate at which deformities arise in animal populations; behaviour in the field or in the laboratory&lt;ref name="Molluscan"&gt;Université Bordeaux et al. [http://molluscan-eye.epoc.u-bordeaux1.fr/index.php?rubrique=accueil&amp;lang=en MolluSCAN ''eye'' project]&lt;/ref&gt;; and by assessing changes in individual physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=França |first=Filipe |last2=Barlow |first2=Jos |last3=Araújo |first3=Bárbara |last4=Louzada |first4=Julio |date=2016-12-01 |title=Does selective logging stress tropical forest invertebrates?

===Frogs and toads as bioindicators===
Amphibians, particularly anurans which consist of frogs and toads, are increasingly used as bioindicators of contaminant accumulation in pollution studies.&lt;ref name="Simon, E. 2010"&gt;Simon, E., Braun, M. &amp; Tóthmérész, B. Water Air Soil Pollut (2010) 209: 467. doi:10.1007/s11270-009-0214-6&lt;/ref&gt; Anurans absorb toxic chemicals through their skin and larval gill membranes and are sensitive to alterations in their environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lambert |first=M.

What are the frogs trying to tell us? OR Malformed Amphibians. Retrieved from http://cgee.hamline.edu/frogs/archives/corner3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Pond breeding anurans are especially sensitive to pollution because of their complex life cycles, which could consist of terrestrial and aquatic living.&lt;ref name="Simon, E. 2010"/&gt; During the embryonic development of them, morphological and behavioral alterations are the effects most frequently cited in connection with chemical exposures.&lt;ref&gt;Venturino, A., Rosenbaum, E., De Castro, A.

Biomarkers, 8(3/4), 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Effects of exposure may result in shorter body length, lower body mass and malformations of limbs or other organs.&lt;ref name="Simon, E. 2010"/&gt; The slow development, late morphological change, and small metamorph size result in increased risk of mortality and exposure to predation.&lt;ref name="Simon, E. 2010"/&gt;

==Microbial indicators==

===Chemical pollutants===

[[Microorganism]]s can be used as indicators of [[aquatic ecosystem |aquatic]] or [[Terrestrial ecoregion |terrestrial]] [[ecosystem health]]. Found in large quantities, microorganisms are easier to sample than other organisms. Some microorganisms will produce new [[proteins]], called [[stress protein]]s, when exposed to contaminants such as [[cadmium]] and [[benzene]]. These stress proteins can be used as an early warning system to detect changes in levels of pollution.

===In oil and gas exploration===
Microbial Prospecting for oil and gas (MPOG) is often used to identify prospective areas for oil and gas occurrences. In many cases oil and gas is known to seep toward the surface as a [[hydrocarbon]] reservoir will usually leak or have leaked towards the surface through [[buoyancy]] forces overcoming sealing pressures. These hydrocarbons can alter the chemical and microbial occurrences found in the near surface soils or can be picked up directly. Techniques used for MPOG include [[DNA analysis]], simple bug counts after culturing a soil sample in a hydrocarbon based medium or by looking at the consumption of hydrocarbon gases in a culture cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rasheed |first1=M. A. et al |title=Application of geo-microbial prospecting method for finding oil and gas reservoirs |journal=Frontiers of Earth Science |date=2015 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=40–50 |doi=10.1007/s11707-014-0448-5 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11707-014-0448-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microalgae in water quality===
[[Microalgae]] have gained attention in the recent years due to several reasons because of their greater sensitivity to pollutants than many other organisms. In addition, they occur abundantly in nature, they are an essential component in very many food webs, they are easy to culture and to use in assays and there are few if any ethical issues involved in their use.

[[File:Gravitactism Euglena.png|thumb|Gravitactic mechanism of the [[microalgae]] ''[[Euglena gracilis]]'' (A) in the absence and (B) in the presence of pollutants.]]

''[[Euglena gracilis]]'' is a motile freshwater photosynthetic flagellate. Although ''Euglena'' is rather tolerant to acidity, it responds rapidly and sensitively to environmental stresses such as heavy metals or inorganic and organic compounds. Typical responses are the inhibition of movement and the change of orientation parameters. Moreover, this organism is very easy to handle and grow, making it a very useful tool for eco-toxicological assessments. One very useful particularity of this organism is the gravitactic orientation, which is very sensitive to pollutants. The gravireceptors are impaired by pollutants such as heavy metals and organic or inorganic compounds. Therefore, the presence of such substances is associated with random movement of the cells in the water column. For short term tests, gravitactic orientation of ''E. gracilis'' is very sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Azizullah |first1=Azizullah |last2=Murad |first2=Waheed |last3=Muhammad |first3=Adnan |last4=Waheed |first4=Ullah |last5=Häder |first5=Donat-Peter |title=Gravitactic orientation of Euglena gracilis - a sensitive endpoint for ecotoxicological assessment of water pollutants |journal=Frontiers in Environmental Science |date=2013 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=1–4 |doi=10.3389/fenvs.2013.00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tahedl |first1=Harald |last2=Donat-Peter |first2=Haeder |title=Automated Biomonitoring Using Real Time Movement Analysis of Euglena gracilis |journal=Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=161–169 |doi=10.1006/eesa.2000.2004 |pmid=11161690 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other species such as ''Paramecium biaurelia'' (see ''[[Paramecium aurelia]]'') also use gravitactic orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hemmersbach |first1=Ruth |last2=Simon |first2=Anja |last3=Waßer |first3=Kai |last4=Hauslage |first4=Jens |last5=Christianen |first5=Peter C.M. |last6=Albers |first6=Peter W. |last7=Lebert |first7=Michael |last8=Richter |first8=Peter |last9=Alt |first9=Wolfgang |last10=Anken |first10=Ralf |title=Impact of a High Magnetic Field on the Orientation of Gravitactic Unicellular Organisms—A Critical Consideration about the Application of Magnetic Fields to Mimic Functional Weightlessness |journal=Astrobiology |date=2014 |volume=14 |issue=3 |doi=10.1089/ast.2013.1085 |pmid=24621307 |pages=205–215 |pmc=3952527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatic [[bioassay]] is possible, using the flagellate ''[[Euglena gracilis]]'' in a device which measures their motility at different dilutions of the possibly polluted water sample, to determine the [[EC50]](the concentration of sample which affects 50 percent of organisms) and the G-value (lowest dilution factor at which no-significant toxic affect can be measured).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tahedl |first1=Harald |last2=Hader |first2=Donat-Peter |title=Fast examination of water quality using the automatic biotest ECOTOX based on the movement behavior of a freshwater flagellate |journal=Water Research | date=1999 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=426–432 |doi=10.1016/s0043-1354(98)00224-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ahmed |first1=Hoda |last2=Häder |first2=Donat-Peter |title=Monitoring of Waste Water Samples Using the ECOTOX Biosystem and the Flagellate Alga Euglena gracilis |journal=Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution |date=2011 |volume=216 |pages=547–560 |doi=10.1007/s11270-010-0552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Europe]], a remote online biomonitoring system was designed in 2006. It is based on bivalve [[mollusc]]s and the exchange of real time data between a remote intelligent device in the field (able to work for more than 1 year without ''[[in-situ]]'' human intervention) and a data centre designed to capture, process and distribute on the web information derived from the data. The technique relates bivalve behaviour, specifically shell gaping activity, to water quality changes. This technology has been successfully used for the assessment of coastal water quality in various countries (France, Spain, Norway, Russia, Svalbard ([[Ny Alesund]]) and New Caledonia).&lt;ref name=Molluscan/&gt;

In the [[United States]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency |Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) published ''Rapid Bioassessment Protocols,'' in 1999, based on measuring macroinvertebrates, as well as [[periphyton]] and [[fish]] for assessment of [[water quality]].&lt;ref name="EPA=RBP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwla.org/index.php?ht=display/ContentDetails/i/1479/pid/1976 |title=Biological Stream Monitoring |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Izaak Walton League of America |access-date=2010-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421203157/http://www.iwla.org/index.php?ht=display%2FContentDetails%2Fi%2F1479%2Fpid%2F1976 |archive-date=2015-04-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=November 1997 |title=Volunteer Stream Monitoring: A Methods Manual |url=http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-06/documents/stream.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-97-003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Africa]], the Southern African Scoring System (SASS) method is based on benthic macroinvertebrates, and is used for the assessment of water quality in Southern African rivers. The SASS [[aquatic biomonitoring]] tool has been refined over the past 30 years and is now on the fifth version (SASS5) in accordance with the [[ISO/IEC 17025]] protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dickens | first1 = CWS | last2 = Graham | first2 = PM | year = 2002 | title = The Southern Africa Scoring System (SASS) version 5 rapid bioassessment for rivers | url = http://www.dwa.gov.za/iwqs/rhp/methods/dickens%20and%20graham.pdf | format = PDF | journal = African Journal of Aquatic Science | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 1–10 | doi=10.2989/16085914.2002.9626569}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SASS5 method is used by the South African [[Department of Water Affairs]] as a standard method for River Health Assessment, which feeds the national River Health Programme and the national Rivers Database.

The [[imposex]] phenomenon in the [[dog conch]] species of [[sea snail]] leads to the abnormal development of a penis in females, but does not cause sterility. Because of this, the species has been suggested as a good indicator of pollution with organic man-made tin compounds in [[Malaysia]]n ports.&lt;ref name=CobImposex&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cob |first=Z.

The '''Centre for Marine Living Resources &amp; Ecology''' ('''CMLRE''') is a [[research institute]] in [[Kochi]], [[Kerala]] under the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences]], [[Government of India]] with a mandate to study the marine living resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Call for research to protect marine life  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/12/03/stories/2010120362620300.htm |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=3 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, apart from implementing various research projects of the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences|ministry]], the institute also manages and operates the [[FORV Sagar Sampada|Fishery Oceanographic Research Vessel (FORV) ''Sagar Sampada'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ministry of Earth Sciences Overview |url=http://dod.nic.in/New%20RTI%20Particulars.pdf |date= |publisher=[[Ministry of Earth Sciences]] (MoES) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417153108/http://dod.nic.in/New%20RTI%20Particulars.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The institute has its origins in the [[FORV Sagar Sampada|''Sagar Sampada'']] cell, which was established under the then Department of Ocean Development, DOD (upgraded to the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences]] in 2006) for managing and co-ordinating activities of [[FORV Sagar Sampada]]. During the beginning of the 9th [[Five-Year plans of India|Five Year Plan]] of the [[Government of India]] in 1998, the Marine Living Resources Programme (MLR Programme) was formulated by the DOD with a view of promoting ocean development activities in the country which inter-alia include mapping of the living resources, preparing inventory of commercially exploitable living marine resources, their optimum utilization through [[ecosystem management]] and R &amp; D in basic sciences on Marine Living Resources &amp; Ecology. With the objective of implementing this programme, the [[FORV Sagar Sampada|''Sagar Sampada'']] cell was upgraded to the Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology. To this date, the research vessel [[FORV Sagar Sampada|''Sagar Sampada'']] serves as the backbone of the MLR research activities co-ordinated by CMLRE.

During the 9th [[Five-Year plans of India|five-year plan]] (1998-2002), the Centre co-ordinated the first systematic study of [[marine life]] along the [[India]]n [[continental shelf|shelf]] waters, along the  eastern and western coasts of India. The environmental characteristics of this region and the [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], marine [[benthos]], [[fishery]] resources etc. of this region were systematically characterized for the first time. During the 10th [[five-Year plans of India|five-year plan]] (2002-2007) the exploration was extended to the [[continental slope]] regions, particularly in the case of marine [[benthos]] and [[fisheries]]. Research thrust was also placed on studies of [[harmful algal blooms]] and [[marine mammals]] around the Indian subcontinent. The environmental and productivity patterns around the Indian [[EEZ]] continued to be monitored and research on the productivity and [[fishery]] resources of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Andaman and Nicobar regions]] was also carried out. In January 2005, after the devastating [[2004 tsunami]] the institute along with [[National Institute of Oceanography, India|National Institute of Oceanography]] and School of Marine Sciences, [[Cochin University of Science and Technology]] (CUSAT), Kochi carried out the one of the first scientific studies regarding the impact of the tsunami on marine life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sagar Sampada to study impact of tsunami  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/05/stories/2005010507390500.htm |newspaper=The Hindu |date=5 Jan 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Tsunami: Research vessel assessing damage to marine ecology|url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/jan/10tsunami4.htm |date=10 January 2005 |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] News }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th and 10th [[Five-Year plans of India|plan periods]], the CMLRE served chiefly as a co-ordinating and fund granting agency, managing the projects that were granted to various other research institutes and universities.

During the 11th [[Five-Year plans of India|five-year plan]] (2007-2012), the CMLRE established in-house R&amp;D activities, apart from co-ordination of projects in other institutes. In this period, focus was placed on continued monitoring of the [[pelagic]] environment and productivity, marine [[benthos]], [[harmful algal blooms]], studies on reproduction and recruitment of [[sardines]] in the south-east [[Arabian Sea]], deep-sea [[fisheries]] and [[myctophid]] resources in the Indian EEZ. Several projects during this period also focused on isolating and identifying [[Bioactive compound|bioactive]] compounds from marine organisms.

A '''chemiresistor''' is a material that changes its [[Electrical_resistance_and_conductance|electrical resistance]] in response to changes in the nearby chemical environment.&lt;ref&gt;Florinel-Gabriel Banica, ''Chemical Sensors and Biosensors: Fundamentals and Applications'', John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, 2012, chapter 11, Print {{ISBN|978-0-470-71066-1}}; Web {{ISBN|0-470710-66-7}}; {{ISBN|978-1-118-35423-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chemiresistors are a class of chemical sensors that rely on the direct chemical interaction between the sensing material and the analyte.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nanosensors: Physical, chemical, and biological|last = Khanna|first = V.K.|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-4398-2712-3|location = Boca Raton, FL|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensing material and the analyte can interact by [[covalent bond]]ing, [[hydrogen bond]]ing, or [[molecular recognition]]. Several different materials have chemiresistor properties: [[MOSFET#Metal–oxide–semiconductor structure|metal-oxide semiconductors]], some [[conductive polymer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandia.gov/mstc/MsensorSensorMsystems/technical-information/chemiresistor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217061257/http://www.sandia.gov/mstc/MsensorSensorMsystems/technical-information/chemiresistor.html |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and nanomaterials like [[graphene]], [[carbon nanotubes]] and [[nanoparticles]]. Typically these materials are used as partially selective [[sensor]]s in devices like [[electronic tongue]]s or [[electronic nose]]s.

A basic chemiresistor consists of a sensing material that bridges the gap between two electrodes or coats a set of [[Interdigital transducer|interdigitated electrodes]]. The resistance between the electrodes can be easily [[Ohmmeter|measured]]. The sensing material has an inherent resistance that can be modulated by the presence or absence of the analyte. During exposure, analytes interact with the sensing material. These interactions cause changes in the resistance reading. In some chemiresistors the resistance changes simply indicate the presence of analyte. In others, the resistance changes are proportional to the amount of analyte present; this allows for the amount of analyte present to be measured.

==History==
As far back as 1965 there are reports of semiconductor materials exhibiting electrical conductivities that are strongly affected by ambient gases and vapours.&lt;ref&gt;J. I. Bregman and A. Dravnieks  Surface Effects in Detection,  1965 :Spartan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Gutman and L.E.

In recent years chemiresistor technology has been used to develop promising sensors for many applications, including conductive polymer sensors for secondhand smoke, carbon nanotube sensors for gaseous ammonia, and metal oxide sensors for hydrogen gas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Detection of Secondhand Cigarette Smoke via Nicotine Using Conductive Polymer Films|url = http://ntr.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/9/1511|journal = Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research|date = 2013-09-01|issn = 1462-2203|pmc = 3842131|pmid = 23482719|pages = 1511–1518|volume = 15|issue = 9|doi = 10.1093/ntr/ntt007|language = en|first = Yuan|last = Liu|first2 = Sadik|last2 = Antwi-Boampong|first3 = Joseph J.|last3 = BelBruno|first4 = Mardi A.|last4 = Crane|first5 = Susanne E.|last5 = Tanski}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Wireless gas detection with a smartphone via rf communication|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/111/51/18162|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2014-12-23|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 4280584|pmid = 25489066|pages = 18162–18166|volume = 111|issue = 51|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1415403111|language = en|first = Joseph M.|last = Azzarelli|first2 = Katherine A.|last2 = Mirica|first3 = Jens B.|last3 = Ravnsbæk|first4 = Timothy M.|last4 = Swager|bibcode = 2014PNAS..11118162A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of chemiresistors to provide accurate real-time information about the environment through small devices that require minimal electricity makes them an appealing addition to the [[internet of things]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

]]

=== Device architectures ===
Chemiresistors can be made by coating an interdigitated electrode with a thin film or by using a thin film or other sensing material to bridge the single gap between two electrodes. Electrodes are typically made of conductive metals such as gold and chromium which make good ohmic contact with thin films.&lt;ref name="Wohltjen85" /&gt; In both architectures, the chemiresistant sensing material controls the conductance between the two electrodes; however, each device architecture has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Interdigitated electrodes allow for a greater amount of the film's surface area to be in contact with the electrode. This allows for more electrical connections to be made and increases the overall conductivity of the system.&lt;ref name="Wohltjen85" /&gt; Interdigitated electrodes with finger sizes and finger spacing on the order of microns are difficult to manufacture and require the use of [[photolithography]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Larger features are easier to fabricate and can be manufactured using techniques such as thermal evaporation. Both interdigitated electrode and single-gap systems can be arranged in parallel to allow for the detection of multiple analytes by one device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nanoscaled interdigitated electrode arrays for biochemical sensors|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400598001282|journal = Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical|date = 1998-06-25|pages = 73–80|volume = 49|issue = 1–2|doi = 10.1016/S0925-4005(98)00128-2|first = Peter|last = Van Gerwen|first2 = Wim|last2 = Laureyn|first3 = Wim|last3 = Laureys|first4 = Guido|last4 = Huyberechts|first5 = Maaike|last5 = Op De Beeck|first6 = Kris|last6 = Baert|first7 = Jan|last7 = Suls|first8 = Willy|last8 = Sansen|first9 = P.|last9 = Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensing materials ===

====Metal oxide semiconductors====
[[MOSFET#Metal–oxide–semiconductor structure|Metal oxide]] chemiresistor sensors were first commercialized in 1970&lt;ref name=Wilson01&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=D. M. |last2=Hoyt |first2=S. |last3=Janata |first3=J. |last4=Booksh |first4=K. |last5=Obando |first5=L. |title=Chemical Sensors for Portable, Handheld Field Instruments |journal=IEEE Sensors Journal |volume=1 |number=4 |pages=256–274 |year=2001 |doi=10.1109/7361.983465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[Carbon monoxide detector#Semiconductor|carbon monoxide detector]] that used powdered [[Tin dioxide#Gas sensing|SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. However, there are many other metal oxides that have chemiresistive properties. Metal oxide sensors are primarily gas sensors, and they can sense both [[Oxidizing agent#Atom-transfer reagents|oxidizing]] and [[Reducing agent#Common reducing agents|reducing]] gases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This makes them ideal for use in industrial situations where gases used in manufacturing can pose a risk to worker safety.

'''Codorus State Park''' is a {{convert|3,500|acre|sing=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Heidelberg Township, York County, Pennsylvania|Heidelberg]], [[Manheim Township, York County, Pennsylvania|Manheim]], [[Penn Township, York County, Pennsylvania|Penn]], and [[West Manheim Township, York County, Pennsylvania|West Manheim]] Townships in southwestern [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the United States. The park was created around Lake Marburg, an [[Reservoir|artificial lake]] covering {{convert|1,275|acre}}, and is named for [[Codorus Creek]], which forms the lake. Codorus State Park is located on [[Pennsylvania Route 216]], {{convert|3|mi}} from the borough of [[Hanover, Pennsylvania|Hanover]].

==History==

===Early history===
When Europeans first reached the land that became Codorus State Park, it was the territory of [[Susquehannock Indians]], a powerful tribe that controlled much of the land near the [[Susquehanna River]]. Wars and the push of settlers, most of which were German farmers, led to the demise of the Susquehannocks, but industry soon followed.

Built in 1762, Mary Ann Furnace is believed to be the first charcoal furnace built on the western side of the Susquehanna River. The furnace supplied [[Round shot|cannonball]]s and grapeshot for the continental army and employed Hessian prisoners to run the ironworks while many of the available workforce were off fighting the British. Nothing remains of the ironworks except memories.

The four original founders of Mary Ann Furnace had a great impact on the United States. George Stevenson emigrated from Ireland and was employed as a deputy surveyor by the [[William Penn|Penn Family]]. Stevenson organized wagons and supplies for the Forbes Campaign during the [[French and Indian War]]. When the British occupied Philadelphia and York became the capital of the Colonies, George Washington called on Stevenson to take charge of the supply lines.

[[George Ross (delegate)|George Ross]] was a lawyer from Lancaster. During the American Revolutionary War, he served in the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Provincial Assembly]], the Provincial Conference and the Continental Congress. He signed the Declaration of Independence. He also introduced George Washington to the widow of his nephew, the flagmaker [[Betsy Ross]].

[[William Thompson (general)|William Thompson]] emigrated from Ireland. In the French and Indian War, he served as an officer under John Armstrong in the [[Kittanning Expedition]] and as a captain of the light horse in the Forbes Campaign. In the American Revolution, he became the colonel of the first colonial infantry and advanced to brigadier general. He was captured in the [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Second Assault on Quebec]] and held prisoner for four years, only to die not long after his release.

Mark Bird was the son of ironmaster William Bird, of [[Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site|Hopewell Furnace]]. In the American Revolution, Bird served as deputy quartermaster and as a colonel. He used his own money and ironworks to supply cannons and munitions. After the war, he was never repaid. Deep in debt, he went bankrupt and fled to North Carolina to avoid his creditors.

===Modern history===
The creation Codorus State Park is tied to a cooperative effort between private enterprise and state and local government. The borough of [[Spring Grove, Pennsylvania|Spring Grove]] and the [[Glatfelter|P.H. Glatfelter Company]] worked together to [[dam]] Codorus Creek. The purpose of the dam was to provide drinking water for Spring Grove and to meet the industrial needs of the paper plant owned by the P.H. Glatfelter Company in the borough. The construction of this dam was also beneficial to the people of Pennsylvania when a park was created on the shores of the newly made [[Lake Marburg]].&lt;ref name="codorussp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/codorus/index.htm|title=Codorus State Park|accessdate=2006-10-16|publisher=[[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake Marburg gets its name from the small community of Marburg, home of a handful of buildings - including a farmstead - that was flooded in December 1966, when Codorus Creek was dammed. The dam is {{convert|109|ft}} high, {{convert|1690|ft}} wide and {{convert|750|ft}} thick. It is not owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but is instead owned by and on the property of the P.H. Glatfelter Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating Over 150 Years of Sustainability|url=http://www.glatfelter.com/about_us/history.aspx|website=Glatfelter History|publisher=Glatfelter|accessdate=23 August 2015|location=27m49s point|format=Video|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land for the park was acquired as part of the [[Project 70 Land Acquisition and Borrowing Act]], with the governor approving the acquisition on December 10, 1964.

To fill its massive water demands, P.H.

The drought also convinced Pennsylvania officials that more reservoirs were needed and that dovetailed with separate state plans to build a new state park on the west branch of the three-pronged Codorus Creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipper, Ph.D.|first1=Mark|title=Paper, People, Progress : The Story of the P.H.

Lake Marburg has {{convert|26|mi}} of coastline.&lt;ref name="codorussp"/&gt; The lake holds many different species of fish. Fishermen will find [[largemouth bass]], [[yellow perch]], [[crappie]], [[muskellunge]], [[catfish]], [[northern pike]], and [[bluegill]] in the warm waters of Lake Marburg. Cold water fishing is available in the east branch of Codorus Creek where anglers will find [[rainbow trout]] and [[brown trout]] that have been [[fish stocking|stocked]] for sport fishing by the [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]].&lt;ref name="codorussp"/&gt; [[Canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s, [[sailboat]]s and motor boats up to 20&amp;nbsp;hp are all permitted on Lake Marburg, provided they are registered properly with the state.&lt;ref name="codorussp"/&gt;
[[File:Kayaking on codorus.jpg|thumb|left|Kayaking at Codorus State Park]]

==Recreation==
The park is open for [[fishing]], [[boating]], and [[camping]]. It also has a [[human swimming|swimming]] pool and a 54-hole [[disc golf]] course.

Codorus State Park has modern and rustic camp site available. There are 198 camp sites that are suitable for [[Recreational vehicle|RV's]] (up to {{convert|50|ft|m}} in length) and tents. There are eight campsites with [[electricity]] or accommodate campers with disabilities. Codorus State Park also has 13 walk-in campsites for those interested in camping in tents only.&lt;ref name="codorussp"/&gt;

Picnic tables are scattered throughout the park, and two pavilions may be reserved for use by large groups.&lt;ref name="codorussp"/&gt;

There are {{convert|5|mi}} of [[hiking]] trails with Codorus State Park. The Mary Ann Furnace trail is {{convert|3.5|mi}} long. It is a loop trail that winds through pine plantations, [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|hardwood forests]] and some [[wetland]]s. The LaHo trail is {{convert|1.5|mi}} long and follows the lakeshore of Lake Marburg through hardwoods and wetlands. Hiking is also possible on the {{convert|7|mi}} horse trail on the west side of the park.&lt;ref name="codorussp"/&gt;

There are two 18-hole disc golf courses, and two 9-hole extra courses at Codorus State Park.  There is also a 9-hole minis course.  The blue course is a more technical 18 holes mostly through wooded areas.  The red course is more open, but has some longer holes.  There is a bonus course with 9 holes and a cross country course with 9 holes.

Hunting is permitted in Codorus State Park. The most common game species are [[ruffed grouse]], [[eastern gray squirrel]], [[wild turkey]] and [[white-tailed deer]]. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania State Game Commission. Hunters are limited to using [[shotgun]]s, [[flintlock|muzzleloaders]] and [[bow (weapon)|bows]].&lt;ref name="codorussp"/&gt;

Codorus State Park does not close in winter. Snowmobiling, cross country skiing, sledding, ice skating, ice fishing and ice sailing are all popular winter activities, when the weather permits.&lt;ref name="codorussp"/&gt;

[[File:Cowpens - main sign 2.JPG|thumb|left|Main Entrance to Cowpens National Battlefield]]

Brigadier General [[Daniel Morgan]] won the [[Battle of Cowpens]], a decisive [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] victory over British Lieutenant Colonel [[Banastre Tarleton]] on January&amp;nbsp;17, 1781. It is considered one of the most memorable victories of Morgan and one of the most memorable defeats of Tarleton.

Established as '''Cowpens National Battlefield Site''' March 4, 1929; transferred from the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] August 10, 1933; redesignated April 11, 1972.  Listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966.&lt;ref name = nris/&gt; Area: 841.56 acres (3.41&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), Federal: {{convert|790.9|acre|km2|1}}, Nonfederal: {{convert|50.66|acre|m2|-1}}.

The visitor center features a museum with exhibits about the American Revolution and the battle, including a fiber-optic map that illustrates the Southern Campaign of the American Revolution and the battle, a walking tour of the battlefield itself, and the reconstructed [[log cabin]] of one Robert Scruggs, who had farmed the land before the establishment of the park.

Polyborodimethylsiloxane&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is a substance called a dilatant that in its raw state flows freely but on shock locks together to absorb and disperse energy as heat before returning to its semi fluid state. The commercial material known as D3O is in essence a closed cell polyurethane foam composite with polyborodimethylsiloxane (PBDMS) as the dilatant dispersed through the foam matrix&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which makes the product rate sensitive thus dissipating more energy than plain polyurethane at specific energy levels. The patent cites optimal proportions for a shock absorbing foam composite formula : by volume, 15–35% of PBDMS and 40–70% fluid (the gas resulting from the foaming process, generally carbon dioxide) the remainder being polyurethane&lt;ref&gt;Richard Palmer &amp; Philip Green for Design Blue Ltd, ''Shock Absorbing Material'' US patent 7,381,460 B2,  https://patents.google.com/patent/US7381460&lt;/ref&gt;. D3O's technology is found in many sports equipment such as body armor.

==History==
British engineers Dr Phil Green and Richard Palmer discovered the material in 1999, first isolating it at the [[University of Hertfordshire]]. Palmer and Green went on to found the firm D3O Lab to develop and market the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/oct2006/id20061013_166852.htm |title=A Superhero Suit for Athletes |publisher=[[Businessweek]] |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2012-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804182103/http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/oct2006/id20061013_166852.htm |archivedate=2011-08-04 |df= }} Article was written by Maria Kamenev, a ''BusinessWeek'' intern.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/10988649/Real-life-Flubber-made-in-the-UK-saving-lives-in-war-zones-and-on-the-football-field.html|title=Real-life 'Flubber', made in the UK, saving lives in war zones and on the football field|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company commercialized the D3O material in 2006. In 2009, the UK Ministry of Defence awarded D3O Lab £100,000 to fit helmets in order to reduce the kinetic energy of a bullet or shrapnel on impact, because of its moldable properties.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harding |first=Thomas |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/4862103/Military-to-use-new-gel-that-stops-bullets.html |title=Military to use new gel that stops bullets |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2009-02-27 |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The Emin Valley has a [[steppe]] ecosystem of mostly [[grassland]]s; with two [[saline lake]]s, [[Lake Alakol|Alakol]] and [[Lake Sasykkol|Sasykkol]]; and mountains with temperate climates.

The Emin Valley Steppe is a [[Palearctic]] [[ecoregion]] in the [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[Biome]]. It lies within the vast and larger [[Eurasian Steppe]].

==Hydrology==
[[Orography|Orographically]], the Emil Valley is an [[endorrheic basin]]. In the north, the [[Tarbagatai Mountains]] separate it from the [[Lake Zaysan]] basin, which is part of the basin of the [[Irtysh]] River, eventually draining into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. In the southeast, another series of mountain ranges separate it from the [[Dzungaria]]n Basin ([[Gurbantünggüt Desert]]).

The Emin Valley's main watercourse is the [[Emil River|Emin (Emil) River]], which flows in the general western direction, receiving numerous streams flowing from the Tarbagatai Mountains and carrying their water to Lake Alakol.

[[Lake Alakol]] and [[Lake Sasykkol]], situated in the western (Kazakhstan) part of the valley, are the homes of the rare [[Dalmatian pelican]] and [[relict gull]].

==Nuclear power==
{{Further information|Nuclear power in India}}
[[File:Kudankulam NPP.jpg|200 px|left|thumb|The Kudankulam Nuclear power plant (2x1000 MW) in [[Tamil Nadu]] while under construction]]
India boasts a quickly advancing and active nuclear power programme. It is expected to have 20 GW of nuclear capacity by 2020, though it currently stands as 9th in the world in terms of nuclear capacity.

An Achilles' heel of the Indian nuclear power programme, however, is the fact that India is not a signatory of the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. This has many times in its history prevented it from obtaining nuclear technology vital to expanding its nuclear industry. Another consequence of this is that much of its programme has been domestically developed much like its nuclear weapons programme. The [[United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act]] seems to be a way to get access to advanced nuclear technologies for India.

{{further information|India's three-stage nuclear power programme}}
India has been using imported enriched uranium and is under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, but it has developed various aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle to support its reactors. Development of select technologies has been strongly affected by limited imports. Use of heavy-water reactors has been particularly attractive for the nation because it allows uranium to be burnt with little to no enrichment. India has also done a great amount of work in the development of a [[India's three stage nuclear power programme|thorium-centred fuel cycle]]. While uranium deposits in the nation are extremely limited, there are much greater reserves of thorium, and it could provide hundreds of times the energy with the same mass of fuel. The fact that thorium can theoretically be utilised in heavy water reactors has tied the development of the two. A prototype reactor that would burn uranium-plutonium fuel while irradiating a thorium blanket is under construction at the Madras/Kalpakkam Atomic Power Station.

Uranium used for the weapons programme has been separate from the power programme using uranium from scant indigenous reserves.

==Hydro electricity==

India is endowed with economically exploitable and viable hydro potential assessed to be about 125,570 MW at 60% [[capacity factor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WEResources_Hydropower_2016.pdf  |title=World Energy Resources Hydro Power, 2016 |publisher= World Energy Council|accessdate=30 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; India ranked fourth globally by underutilized hydro power potential. In addition, 6,780 MW in terms of installed capacity from Small, Mini, and Micro Hydel schemes have been assessed. Also, 56 sites for [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage]] schemes with an aggregate installed capacity of 94,000 MW have been identified for catering to peak electricity demand and water pumping for irrigation needs. It is the most widely used form of [[renewable energy]] but the economically exploitable hydro power potential keeps on varying due to technological developments and the comparable cost of electricity generation from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/365955283/Harnessing-gigantic-hydro-power-potential-of-Indus-Jhelum-and-Chenab-rivers-in-India  |title=Harnessing gigantic hydro power potential of Indus, Jhelum and Chenab rivers in India |accessdate=30 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hydro-electric potential of India ranks 5th in terms of exploitable hydro-potential on global scenario.

The installed capacity of hydro power is 45,315 MW as of 31 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cea.nic.in/monthlyhpi.html  |title=List of Hydro Electric Stations in the Country| publisher=Central Electricity Authority, GoI |accessdate=30 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; India ranks sixth in [[hydro electricity]] generation globally after China, Canada, Brazil, USA and Russia. During the year 2017-18, the total hydro electricity generation in India is 126.123 billion kWh which works out to 24,000 MW at 60% capacity factor. Till now, hydroelectricity sector is dominated by the state and central government owned companies but this sector is going to grow faster with the participation of private sector for developing the hydro potential located in the [[Himalayas|Himalaya]] mountain ranges including north east of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/proj_mon/he_execution.pdf| title=List of Hydro projects under execution | publisher=Central Electricity Authority, Ministry of Power, Government of India | date=April 2014 | accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the hydro power potential in central India forming part of [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]] and [[Narmada River|Narmada]] river basins has not yet been developed on major scale due to potential opposition from the tribal population.

[[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|Pumped storage]] schemes are perfect centralised peaking power stations for the load management in the electricity grid.  Pumped storage schemes would be in high demand for meeting peak load demand and storing the surplus electricity as India graduates from  electricity deficit to electricity surplus. They also produce secondary /seasonal power at no additional cost when rivers are flooding with excess water. [[Grid energy storage|Storing electricity]] by other alternative systems such as [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[Compressed air battery|compressed air storage]] systems, etc. is more costlier than electricity production by [[standby generator]]. India has already established nearly 6800 MW pumped storage capacity which is part of its installed [[List of power stations in India|hydro power plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://npti.in/Download/Hydro/Pumped%20Storage%20Hydro%20Power%20Plant,%20Electrical%20India,%20Nov,%202013.pdf |title=Pumped storage hydro power plant |accessdate=27 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707211619/http://npti.in/Download/Hydro/Pumped%20Storage%20Hydro%20Power%20Plant%2C%20Electrical%20India%2C%20Nov%2C%202013.pdf |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

India's [[solar energy]] insolation is about 5,000 T kWh per year (i.e. ~ 600 TW), far more than its current total primary energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VMY-4CSXM8T-2&amp;_user=520880&amp;_coverDate=10%2F01%2F2005&amp;_alid=611831031&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=full&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=6163&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=1&amp;_acct=C000023460&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=520880&amp;md5=fb8bc24f0ebe81f43f43d217306373c5 Sustainable production of solar electricity] with particular reference to the Indian economy (publication archived in ScienceDirect, shows numbers in detail, but needs subscription / access via university)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewingindia.org/finren.html Renewing India – Under Heading:Solar Photovoltaics]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar power in India|India's]] long-term solar potential could be unparalleled in the world because it has the ideal combination of both high [[Insolation|solar insolation]] and a big potential [[consumer|consumer base]] density.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/01/solar_leds_brig.php Solar LEDs Brighten Rural India's Future]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3623864.stm Solar plan for Indian computers]&lt;/ref&gt;
With a major section of its citizens still surviving off-grid, India's grid system is considerably under-developed. Availability of cheap solar can bring electricity to people, and bypass the need of installation of expensive grid lines.
Also a major factor influencing a region's [[energy intensity]] is the cost of energy consumed for temperature control. Since cooling load requirements are roughly in phase with the sun's intensity, [[Air conditioning|cooling]] from intense solar radiation could make perfect energy-economic sense in the subcontinent, whenever the required technology becomes competitively cheaper.

Installation of [[solar power]] PV plants require nearly 2.0 hectares (5 acres) land per MW capacity which is similar to coal-fired power plants  when life cycle coal mining, consumptive water storage &amp; ash disposal areas are also accounted and hydro power plants when submergence area of water reservoir is also accounted. 1.6 million MW capacity solar plants can be installed in India on its 1% land (32,000 square km). There are vast tracts of land suitable for solar power in all parts of India exceeding 8% of its total area which are unproductive barren and devoid of vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://dolr.nic.in/dolr/wasteland_atlas.asp |title=  Waste lands atlas of India, 2011 |accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/58789333/Geographical-Area-and-Its-Effective-Utilization |title=  Geographical Area and Its Effective Utilization|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of waste lands (32,000 square km) when installed with solar power plants can produce 2400 billion kWh of electricity (two times the total generation in 2013-14) with land productivity/yield of 0.9 million Rs per acre (3 Rs/kWh price) which is at par with many industrial areas and many times more than the best productive irrigated agriculture lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/this-gujarat-village-is-harvesting-a-sunny-crop/53473954 |title=This Gujarat village is harvesting a sunny crop |accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these solar power units are not dependent on supply of any raw material and are self productive. There is unlimited scope for solar electricity to replace all fossil fuel energy requirements (natural gas, coal, lignite and crude oil) if all the marginally productive lands are occupied by solar power plants in future. The solar power potential of India can meet perennially to cater per capita energy consumption at par with USA/Japan for the peak population in its [[demographic transition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://populationpyramid.net/india/  Population pyramids of India from 1950 to 2100]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synergy with irrigation water pumping and hydro power stations'''
[[File:Price history of silicon PV cells since 1977.svg|thumb|Price history of silicon PV cells since 1977. The great thing about solar power is that it is a technology and not a fuel. It is unlimited and the more it is deployed the cheaper it would be.&lt;ref name=tariff/&gt; While the more limited fossil fuels are used, the more expensive they become.]]
The major disadvantage of solar power (PV type only) is that it can not produce electricity during the night time and cloudy day time also. In India, this disadvantage can be overcome by installing [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] stations. Ultimate  electricity requirement for river water pumping (excluding ground water pumping) is 570 billion kWh to pump one cubic meter of water for each square meter area by 125 m height on average for irrigating 140 million hectares of net sown area (42% of total land) for three crops in a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwc.nic.in/main/webpages/statistics.html#2 India – Land and Water Resources at a glance, CWC (accessdate 12 June 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved by utilising  all the usable river waters by [[Indian Rivers Inter-link|interlinking Indian rivers]] by envisaging [[coastal reservoir]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/390880621/Feasibility-of-coastal-reservoir-to-harness-Brahmaputra-and-Ganga-surplus-waters |title=Feasibility of coastal reservoir to harness Brahmaputra and Ganga surplus waters|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These river water pumping stations would also be envisaged with pumped-storage hydroelectricity features to generate electricity when necessary to stabilise the grid. Also, all existing and future hydro power stations can be expanded with additional pumped-storage hydroelectricity units to cater night time electricity consumption. Most of the ground water pumping power can be met directly by solar power during daytime. To achieve [[food security]], India needs to achieve [[water security]] which is possible only by [[energy security]] for harnessing its [[Water Resources in India|water resources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Lester R.

'''Electric vehicles'''
{{See also|Electric vehicle industry in India}}
The retail prices of [[Gasoline|petrol]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] are high in India to make [[Electric vehicle|electricity driven vehicles]] more economical as more and more electricity is generated from solar energy in near future without appreciable environmental effects. During the year 2013, many [[Independent Power Producer|IPPs]] offered to sell solar power below 6.50 Rs/kWh to feed into the low voltage (&lt; 33 KV) grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/states/solar-power-bidders-accept-rs-649unit-offer-from-ap/article4873499.ece|title= Solar power bidders accept Rs 6.49/unit offer from AP|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This price is below the affordable electricity retail tariff for the solar power to replace petrol and diesel use in transport sector.

The  retail price of diesel is 53.00 Rs/litre in 2012-13. The affordable electricity retail price (860 kcal/kWh at 75% input electricity to shaft power efficiency) to replace diesel (lower heating value 8572 kcal/litre at 40% [[Brake specific fuel consumption|fuel energy to crank shaft efficiency]]) is 9.97 Rs/kWh. The  retail price of petrol is 75.00 Rs/litre in 2012-13. The affordable electricity retail price (860 kcal/kWh at 75% input electricity to shaft power efficiency) to replace petrol (lower heating value 7693 kcal/litre at 33% fuel energy to crank shaft efficiency) is 19.06 Rs/kWh. In 2012-13, India consumed 15.744 million tons petrol and 69.179 million tons diesel which are mainly produced from imported crude oil at huge foreign exchange out go.&lt;ref name=png2013/&gt;

== Electricity as substitute to imported LPG and kerosene==
{{See also|Energy in India}}
The net import of [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] is 6.093 million tons and the domestic consumption is 13.568 million tons with Rs. 41,546 crores subsidy to the domestic consumers in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/india-challenges-china-as-worlds-biggest-lpg-importer/62263809|title= India challenges China as world's biggest LPG importer|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=png2013/&gt; The LPG import content is nearly 40% of total consumption in India. The affordable electricity retail price (860 kcal/kWh at 90% heating efficiency) to replace LPG (lower heating value 11,000 kcal/kg at 75% heating efficiency) in domestic cooking is 6.47 Rs/kWh when the retail price of LPG cylinder is Rs 1000 (without subsidy) with 14.2&amp;nbsp;kg LPG content. Replacing LPG consumption with electricity reduces its imports substantially.

The domestic consumption of [[Kerosene]] is 7.349 million tons with Rs. 30,151 crores subsidy to the domestic consumers in 2012-13. The subsidised retail price of Kerosene is 13.69 Rs/litre whereas the export/import price is 48.00 Rs/litre. The affordable electricity retail price(860 kcal/kWh at 90% heating efficiency) to replace Kerosene (lower heating value 8240 kcal/litre at 75% heating efficiency) in domestic cooking is 6.00 Rs/kWh when Kerosene retail price is 48 Rs/litre (without subsidy).

During the year 2013-14, The [[Capacity factor|plant load factor]] (PLF) of coal-fired thermal power stations is only 65.43% whereas these stations can run above 85% PLF comfortably provided there is adequate electricity demand in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/monthly/generation_rep/tentative/mar14/opm_11.pdf|title= All India coal fired stations performance (2013-14)|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The additional electricity generation at 85% PLF is nearly 240 billion units which is adequate to replace all the LPG and Kerosene consumption in domestic sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/arvind-panagariya-pitches-for-electricity-as-clean-cooking-option-to-lpg/articleshow/51786931.cms|title= Niti Aayog pitches for electricity as clean cooking option to LPG|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incremental cost of generating additional electricity is only their coal fuel cost which is less than 3 Rs/kWh. Enhancing the PLF of coal-fired stations and encouraging domestic electricity consumers to substitute electricity in place of LPG and Kerosene in household cooking, would reduce the government subsidies and idle capacity of thermal power stations can be put to use economically. The domestic consumers who are willing to surrender the subsidised LPG / Kerosene permits or eligible for subsidised LPG / Kerosene permits, may be given free electricity connection and subsidised electricity tariff.

==Energy conservation==
{{See also |Negawatt power}}
[[Energy conservation]] has emerged as a major policy objective, and the Energy Conservation Act 2001, was passed by the Indian Parliament in September 2001, 35.5% of the population still live without access to electricity. This Act requires large energy consumers to adhere to energy consumption norms; new buildings to follow the [[Energy Conservation Building Code]]; and appliances to meet energy performance standards and to display energy consumption labels. The Act also created the Bureau of Energy Efficiency to implement the provisions of the Act. In 2015, Prime Minister Mr. Modi launched a scheme called 
[[Bachat Lamp Yojna|Prakash Path]] urging people to use [[LED lamps]] in place of other lamps to drastically cut down lighting power requirement. Energy efficient fans at subsidised price are offered to the electricity consumers by the electricity distribution companies (DisComs) to decrease peak electricity load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-01-20/news/69931198_1_eesl-fans-ceiling|title= Andhra Pradesh to replace 1 Lakh ceiling fans with energy-efficient ones|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural electrification==
{{See|Rural Electrification Corporation Limited}}
# The key development objectives of the power sector is supply of electricity to all areas including rural areas as mandated in section 6 of the [[The Electricity Act, 2003|Electricity Act]]. Both the central government and state governments would jointly endeavour to achieve this objective at the earliest. Consumers, particularly those who are ready to pay a tariff which reflects efficient costs have the right to get uninterrupted twenty four hours supply of quality power. About 56% of rural households have not yet been electrified even though many of these households are willing to pay for electricity. Determined efforts should be made to ensure that the task of [[rural electrification]] for securing [[Indian states ranking by households having electricity|electricity access to all households]] and also ensuring that electricity reaches poor and marginal sections of the society at reasonable rates is completed within the next five years. India is using Renewable Sources of Energy like [[Hydroelectricity|Hydel Energy]], [[Wind Energy]], and [[Solar Energy]] to electrify villages.
# Reliable rural electrification system will aim at creating the following:
## Rural Electrification Distribution Backbone (REDB) with at least one 33/11 kv (or 66/11 kv) substation in every Block and more if required as per load, networked and connected appropriately to the state transmission system
## Emanating from REDB would be supply feeders and one distribution transformer at least in every village settlement.
## Household Electrification from distribution transformer to connect every household on demand.
## Wherever above is not feasible (it is neither cost effective nor the optimal solution to provide grid connectivity) decentralised [[distributed generation]] facilities together with local distribution network would be provided so that every household gets access to electricity. This would be done either through conventional or non-conventional methods of electricity generation whichever is more suitable and economical. Non-conventional sources of energy could be utilised even where grid connectivity exists provided it is found to be cost effective.
## Development of infrastructure would also cater for requirement of agriculture &amp; other economic activities including irrigation pump sets, small and medium industries, khadi and village industries, cold chain and social services like health and education.
# Particular attention would be given in household electrification to dalit bastis, tribal areas and other weaker sections.
# Rural Electrification Corporation of India, a Government of India enterprise will be the nodal agency at Central Government level to implement the programme for achieving the goal set by National Common Minimum Programme of giving access to electricity to all the households in next five years. Its role is being suitably enlarged to ensure timely implementation of rural electrification projects.
# Targeted expansion in access to electricity for rural households in the desired timeframe can be achieved if the distribution licensees recover at least the cost of electricity and related O&amp;M expenses from consumers, except for lifeline support to households below the poverty line who would need to be adequately subsidised. Subsidies should be properly targeted at the intended beneficiaries in the most efficient manner. Government recognises the need for providing necessary capital subsidy and soft long-term debt finances for investment in rural electrification as this would reduce the cost of supply in rural areas. Adequate funds would need to be made available for the same through the Plan process. Also commensurate organisational support would need to be created for timely implementation. The Central Government would assist the State Governments in achieving this.
# Necessary institutional framework would need to be put in place not only to ensure creation of rural electrification infrastructure but also to operate and maintain supply system for securing reliable power supply&lt;ref name=Energy2&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/58789313/Electricity-Online-Trading "Electricity online trading in India"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Energy3&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iefe.unibocconi.it/wps/allegatiCTP/RR_No_2_ERI_viola_1.pdf |title=  Integrating European Electricity Markets|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to consumers. Responsibility of operation &amp; maintenance and cost recovery could be discharged by utilities through appropriate arrangements with Panchayats, local authorities, NGOs and other franchisees etc.
# The gigantic task of rural electrification requires appropriate cooperation among various agencies of the State Governments, Central Government and participation of the community. Education and awareness programmes would be essential for creating demand for electricity and for achieving the objective of effective community participation.

The electricity industry was restructured by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061210173250/http://www.powermin.nic.in/acts_notification/electricity_act2003/preliminary.htm Electricity Act 2003], which unbundled the [[vertically integrated]] electricity supply utilities in each state of India into a transmission utility, and a number of generating and distribution utilities. [[Central Electricity Regulatory Commission|Electricity Regulatory Commissions]] in each state set tariffs for electricity sales. The Act also enables open access on the transmission system, allowing any consumer (with a load of greater than 1 MW) to buy electricity from any generator. Significantly, it also requires each Regulatory Commission to specify the minimum percentage of electricity that each distribution utility must source from [[renewable energy]] sources.

The introduction of [[Availability based tariff]] has brought about stability to a great extent in the Indian transmission grids. However, presently it is becoming outdated in a power surplus grid. A report in 2005 suggested that there was room for improvement in terms of the efficiency of electricity generation in India, and suggested that two factors possibly responsible for the inefficiency were [[public ownership]] of utilities and low [[capacity utilisation]].&lt;ref name=twsA37&gt;{{cite news

'''Energy technology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[engineering]] [[science]] having to do with the efficient, safe, [[environmentally friendly]] and economical extraction, conversion, transportation, storage and use of [[energy]], targeted towards yielding high efficiency whilst skirting [[adverse effect|side effects]] on humans, nature and the environment.

For people, energy is an overwhelming need and as a scarce [[resource]] it has been an underlying cause of political conflicts and wars. The gathering and use of energy resources can be harmful to local ecosystems and may have global outcomes.

==Interdisciplinary fields==
As an interdisciplinary science Energy technology is linked with many interdisciplinary fields in sundry, overlapping ways.

* [[Physics]], for [[thermodynamics]] and [[nuclear physics]]
* [[Chemistry]] for [[fuel]], [[combustion]], [[air pollution]], [[flue gas]], [[battery (electricity)|battery]] technology and [[fuel cells]].
* [[Electrical engineering]]
* [[Engineering]], often for fluid energy machines such as [[combustion engines]], turbines, pumps and [[compressors]].
* [[Geography]], for [[geothermal]] energy and exploration for resources.

==Electrical engineering==
[[Image:Qatar, power lines (6).jpg|thumb|High-voltage lines for the long distance transportation of electrical energy]]

[[Electric power engineering]] deals with the production and use of [[electrical energy]], which can entail the study of machines such as [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[electric motor]]s and [[transformer]]s. [[Infrastructure]] involves [[Electrical substation|substations]] and [[transformer station]]s, [[power line]]s and [[Power cable|electrical cable]]. [[Load management]] and [[power management]] over networks have meaningful sway on overall energy efficiency. [[Electric heating]] is also widely used and researched.

==Thermodynamics==
{{Main article|Thermodynamics}}

[[Thermodynamics]] deals with the fundamental laws of energy conversion and is drawn from theoretical [[Physics]].

==Thermal and chemical energy==
[[Image:Wood-fired grate stoker.jpg|thumb|left|A [[wikt:grate|grate]] for a wood fire]]
Thermal and chemical energy are intertwined with [[chemistry]] and [[environmental studies]]. [[Combustion]] has to do with [[Gas burner|burner]]s and chemical [[engine]]s of all kinds, grates and [[incinerator]]s along with their energy efficiency, [[pollution]] and operational safety.

[[Exhaust gas]] purification technology aims to lessen [[air pollution]] through sundry mechanical, thermal and chemical cleaning methods. [[Emission control (disambiguation)|Emission control]] technology is a field of [[process engineering|process]] and [[chemical engineering]]. [[Boiler]] technology deals with the design, construction and operation of [[steam]] boilers and [[steam turbine|turbine]]s (also used in nuclear power generation, see below), drawn from [[applied mechanics]] and [[materials engineering]].

[[Energy conversion]] has to do with internal combustion engines, turbines, pumps, fans and so on, which are used for transportation, mechanical energy and power generation. High thermal and mechanical loads bring about operational safety worries which are dealt with through many branches of applied engineering science.
{{Clear}}

==Nuclear energy==
[[Image:Turbogenerator01.jpg|thumb|A [[steam turbine]].]]
[[Nuclear technology]] deals with [[nuclear power]] production from [[nuclear reactor]]s, along with the processing of nuclear fuel and disposal of radioactive waste, drawing from applied [[nuclear physics]], [[nuclear chemistry]] and [[radiation]] science.

Nuclear power generation has been politically controversial in many countries for several decades but the electrical energy produced through [[nuclear fission]] is of worldwide importance. There are high hopes that [[Fusion power|fusion]] technologies will one day replace most fission reactors but this is still a research area of [[nuclear physics]].

==Renewable energy==
{{Main article|Renewable energy}}
[[Image:Nellis AFB Solar panels.jpg|thumb|Solar ([[photovoltaic]]) panels at a military base in the US.]]
[[Renewable energy]] has many branches.

===Solar power===
{{Main article|Solar power}}

* [[Photovoltaic]] power draws electricity from solar radiation through [[solar cells]], either locally or in large photovoltaic power plants and uses [[semiconductor]] technology.
* [[Solar heating]] uses [[solar panel]]s which gather heat from sunlight to heat buildings and water.
* [[Solar thermal power]] produces electricity by converting solar heat.

===Wind power===
[[Image:WindMills.jpg|right|thumb|[[Wind turbine]]s on [[Inner Mongolia]]n grassland]]
{{Main article|Wind power}}

[[Wind turbine]]s draw energy from atmospheric currents and are designed using [[aerodynamics]] along with knowledge taken from mechanical and electrical engineering.

===Geothermal===
{{Main article|Geothermal}}

Where it can be had, [[geothermal]] energy is used for heating and electricity.

===Hydropower===
[[Image:Walchenseewerk Pelton 120.jpg|thumb|Building of [[Pelton turbine|Pelton water turbine]]s in [[Germany]].]]
{{Main article|Hydropower}}

Hydropower draws mechanical energy from rivers, [[wave power plant|ocean waves]] and [[tidal power|tides]]. [[Civil engineering]] is used to study and build [[dam]]s, [[tunnel]]s, [[waterways]] and manage coastal resources through [[hydrology]] and [[geology]]. A low speed [[water turbine]] spun by flowing water can power an [[electrical generator]] to produce electricity.

===Bioenergy===
{{Main article|Bioenergy}}
Bioenergy deals with the gathering, processing and use of biomasses grown in biological manufacturing, [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] from which [[power plant]]s can draw burning fuel. [[Ethanol]], [[methanol]] (both controversial) or hydrogen for [[fuel cells]] can be had from these technologies and used to generate electricity.

===Enabling technologies===

[[Heat pumps]] and [[Thermal energy storage]] are classes of technologies that can enable the utilization of renewable energy sources that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or [[waste heat]] from a process).

Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal]], and can involve storage of [[Sensible heat|sensible energy]] (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or [[latent energy]] (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hyropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|borehole thermal energy storage]] allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Bill (June 28, 2011), [http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf "Drake Landing Solar Community"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030520/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto, pp. 1–30, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong B., Thornton J.

Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|between opposing seasons]] (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a [[Heat pumps|heat pump]]. Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called [[phase-change material]]s (PCMs).

The '''Europium anomaly''' is the phenomenon whereby the [[europium]] (Eu) concentration in a mineral is either enriched or depleted relative to some standard, commonly a [[chondrite]] or mid-ocean ridge basalt ([[MORB]]).  In [[geochemistry]] a europium anomaly is said to be "positive" if the Eu concentration in the mineral is enriched relative to the other [[rare-earth elements]] (REEs) and is said to be "negative" if Eu is depleted relative to the other REEs. 

While all [[lanthanide]]s form relatively large trivalent (3+) ions, Eu and [[cerium]] (Ce) have additional [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]s, europium forms 2+ ions, and Ce forms [[Cerium anomaly|4+]] ions, leading to chemical reaction differences in how these ions can partition versus the 3+ REEs. In the case of Eu, its reduced divalent (2+) cations are similar in size and carry the same charge as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, an ion found in [[plagioclase]] and other minerals. While Eu is an [[incompatible element]] in its trivalent form (Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) in an oxidizing [[magma]], it is preferentially incorporated into plagioclase in its divalent form (Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in a reducing magma where it substitutes for [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OmUXW8pqUe8C&amp;pg=PA550 | chapter = The Europium anomaly| pages = 550–553 | title = Systematics and the properties of the lanthanides | isbn = 978-90-277-1613-2 | author1 = Sinha, Shyama P | author2 = Scientific Affairs Division, North Atlantic Treaty Organization | year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrichment or depletion is generally attributed to europium's tendency to be incorporated into plagioclase preferentially over other minerals. If a magma crystallizes stable plagioclase, most of the Eu will be incorporated into this mineral causing a higher than expected concentration of Eu in the mineral versus other REE in that mineral (a positive anomaly). The rest of the magma will then be relatively depleted in Eu with a concentration of Eu lower than expected versus the concentrations of other REEs in that magma.  If the Eu-depleted magma is then separated from its plagioclase crystals and subsequently solidifies, its chemical composition will display a negative Eu anomaly (because the Eu is locked up in the plagioclase left in the magma chamber). Conversely, if a magma ''accumulates'' plagioclase crystals before solidification, its rock composition will display a relatively positive Eu anomaly.&lt;ref name="science-plag1973"&gt;{{cite journal

A well-known example of the Eu anomaly is seen on the moon.  REE analyses of the moon's light-colored [[lunar highlands]] show a large positive Eu anomaly due to the plagioclase-rich [[anorthosite]] comprising the highlands.  The darker [[lunar mare]], consisting mainly of [[basalt]], shows a large negative Eu anomaly. This has led geologists to speculate as to the genetic relationship between the lunar highlands and mare.  It is possible that much of the moon's Eu was incorporated into the earlier, plagioclase-rich highlands, leaving the later basaltic mare strongly depleted in Eu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''Feersum Endjinn''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[Novel in Scotland|novel by Scottish]] writer [[Iain M. Banks]], first published in 1994. It won a [[BSFA award|British Science Fiction Association Award]] in 1994.

The novel is sometimes referred to as Banks' second science fiction novel not set within the [[The Culture|Culture universe]], the first being ''[[Against a Dark Background]]''.

==Setting==

The book is set on a far future [[Earth]] where the [[mind uploading|uploading of mindstate]]s into a world-spanning [[computer network]] (known as "Cryptosphere", "the Data Corpus", or simply "Crypt") is commonplace, allowing the dead to be easily [[reincarnation|reincarnated]], a set number of times, first physically and then virtually within the crypt.  The crypt has become increasingly chaotic, causing much concern within society. Much of the story takes place within a giant, decaying megastructure known as the "Fastness" or "Serehfa" built to resemble a medieval castle, in which each "room" spans several kilometers horizontally and vertically, and the king's palace occupies one room's chandelier. The structure used to be a space elevator, left behind by the ancestors of those who remained on earth, with the circuitry of the crypt built into its structure. The world is in crisis as the [[solar system]] is slowly drifting into an interstellar [[molecular cloud]] ("the Encroachment"), which will eventually dim and then destroy the Sun, ending life on Earth.

==Plot summary==

The narrative switches between four main characters. Count Sessine is a high-ranking member of the court who is assassinated, ending his last life. Reborn inside the crypt he comes under repeated attack and is almost permanently killed. On his last virtual life, he makes contact with a copy of himself who assists him. He spends many subjective years wandering the wider reaches of the crypt before being contacted by its representative who requests his aid in relation to the encroachment.

Gadfium, the Chief Scientist of the ruling class, is engaged in a conspiracy with like-minded nobles who believe that the elite are not acting in the best interests of the population, and who question the real motive of the ongoing war with the rival clan of Engineers. She becomes aware of a message that has apparently been sent from the fast tower, the highest, inaccessible part of the castle which stresses the danger of the Encroachment and tells of an attempt by the crypt to activate a long forgotten sub system which may prevent disaster. The message also warns that this will be opposed by those in power as it will threaten their interests. She and her fellow conspirators are considering how to respond when the security forces attempt to arrest them, although Gadfium manages to escape into the depths of the castle.

Bascule the Teller is a young man who contacts the dead personalities within the crypt on behalf of their relatives or other interested parties. Whilst searching for a lost friend, he attracts the attention of the Security forces and takes refuge with various [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeric]] animals whose implants have taken on personalities from the within the crypt. He is eventually tasked with ascending the central shaft of the highest tower in a vacuum balloon in order to reach its control room.

[[Asura]] is a young woman who awakens in an re-incarnation facility with no memory. She is compelled to travel towards the castle, rapidly gathering knowledge about the world before being captured by the security forces. She is interrogated within the crypt, but is able to resist the questioning, becoming stronger at understanding and manipulating her virtual environments. As she escapes her virtual prison, she is physically freed by Gadfium, assisted by the copy of Count Sessine who had guided her to Asura's location. Asura broadcasts to the world the truth regarding the encroachment and the attempts of the monarchy to prevent the activation of the crypt sub-systems. She explains her origin, being an emissary of the crypt that was combined with the mind of Count Sessine who sacrificed himself in the process. She was created by the crypt because the relevant systems were kept separate by their designers to prevent infection by chaos. The so-called chaotic elements of the crypt are a burgeoning [[ecology]] of [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligences]]. Asura states that both the humans and chaos will have to learn to live with each other. Asura and Gadfium depart, reaching an elevator which is activated for them by Bascule after reaching the control room at the summit of the tower. Asura is able to activate the "Fearsome Engine" of the title, which begins the slow process of relocating the solar system out of reach of the cloud.

==Writing style==

A quarter of the book is told by Bascule the Teller and is written [[phonetic transcription|phonetically]] in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] using phonetic transcription and shorthand (also evinced in the novel's title). No dialect words are used, but there are (inconsistent) hints of a Scottish and a [[Cockney]] accent.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline McCracken-Flesher ''Scotland as Science Fiction'', (Bucknell University Press, 2011), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth chapter of the book's Part One opens with:
{{quote|Woak up. Got dresd. Had brekfast. Spoke wif Ergates thi ant who sed itz juss been wurk wurk wurk 4 u lately master Bascule, Y dont u ½ a holiday? &amp; I agreed &amp; that woz how we decided we otter go 2 c Mr Zoliparia in thi I-ball ov thi gargoyle Rosbrith.}}

==Literary significance and criticism==
''Feersum Endjinn'' was generally well-received, the completeness of the plot and the detailed description of the mega-architecture and the crypt were praised by critics.

Literary critic and historian Ian Duncan has argued that Banks’s ‘fearsome engine’, like his bridge, “is another allegory of the state, except that this apparatus is not just sublime in its dissociation from human accountability – it is omniscient, providential, and even organic.”&lt;ref&gt;''Culture, Nation, And the New Scottish Parliament'' (Bucknell University Press, 2007) edited by Caroline McCracken-Flesher, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' described it as "Dazzling stuff: a shame it doesn't add up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/iain-m-banks/feersum-endjinn/ |journal=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |title=''Feersum Endjinn'' by Iain M.

[[Terry Pratchett]]'s [[fiction]]al [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]] has a large number of creatures and plants unique to it or its parasite universes (such as Fairyland or [[Death's Domain]]).

==Fauna==

===Ambiguous Puzuma===
A [[big cat]] with a unique black and white check coat, the ambiguous puzuma is the Disc's fastest animal. Due to the Disc's standing [[Magic (Discworld)|magical]] field, which slows down light to approximately the speed of sound, the puzuma can actually achieve near-[[speed of light|light-speed]]. Therefore, seeing a puzuma in motion means it isn't there. Puzumas commonly die from complications caused by [[Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle|Sangrit Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle]]; they lose concentration because they cannot simultaneously know who they are and where they are, frequently causing them to crash into an obstacle. Many males also die from ankle failure caused by excessively running after females who aren't present.

===Basilisk===

A giant and nearly extinct snake, seen in ''[[Sourcery]]''. It has similar powers to a traditional [[basilisk]], such as deadly venom and the ability to kill something by looking at it. When the basilisk in ''Sourcery'' met [[the Luggage]], it attempted to stare the Luggage to death. However, thanks to the luggage's penetrating eyeless stare, the basilisk was unable to win the resulting staring contest, and was forced to blink.  It was then killed by the Luggage.

===Bookworm, .303===
A [[bookworm (insect)|bookworm]] that has evolved in magical libraries. Because of the constant danger of running into a volume containing spells (which release thaumic radiation), the [[.303 British|.303 caliber]] bookworm eats quickly. So quickly, in fact, that it has been known to ricochet off walls after boring through a shelf of books. It is the second fastest thing on the Disc (the fastest being [[Casanunda]] in a nunnery).

===Chimera===
A parody of the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]] of Greek mythology, an archetypal Greek "hybrid monster". The Discworld chimera pastiches this by having, according to a bestiary quoted in ''[[Sourcery]]'', "thee legges of a mermaide, the hair of a tortoise, the teeth of a fowel and the winges of a snake. Of course, I have only my worde for it, the beast having the breathe of a furnace and the temperament of a rubber balloon in a hurricane."

The chimera is native to [[Discworld geography#Klatch|Klatch]], but is a very rare species. The only one seen in the books made itself rarer by attacking [[the Luggage]].

===Clock cuckoo===
A [[cuckoo]] that builds clocks to impress potential mates (compare [[bowerbird]]). The clocks, however, keep lousy time, and thus cannot be seen as evidence for an [[intelligent designer]].

===Curious Squid===
A small species of [[squid]], whose curiosity exceeds their ability at making connections. They are small, harmless and reckoned by many experts to have the foulest taste of any creature in the world. Due to this they are in great demand at a certain type of [[restaurant]] where skilled chefs with great care make dishes containing no trace of the squid at all (a spoof on [[fugu]]). Apparently the only place they can be found is in the area around the sunken island of Leshp, in the Circle Sea, approximately halfway between Al-Khali and [[Ankh-Morpork]].

===Dragons ===
Dragons are a [[genus]] of [[reptile]]s which apparently evolved from a group of ''Draco lunaris'' on the Disc's [[Moon]].

====''Draco lunaris''====
Possibly the original species of dragon, these Moon Dragons inhabit the Disc's moon. They are quite similar to ''Draco vulgaris'', but have silver scales and flame from their rears. This allows them [[flight]] by means of the [[rocket]] principle. They subsist on a silvery plant which apparently covers much of the Moon and glows by means of [[phosphorescence]], creating moonlight. This species is seen in ''[[The Last Hero]]''.  Errol from [[Guards! Guards!]] could also be an [[atavism]] to this species as by the end of the book he had turned pale from neck down and started flying around by shooting flame from his rear.

====''Draco nobilis''====
Noble Dragons are the large, graceful fire-breathing [[European dragon|creatures of legend]]. Probably evolved from ''Draco vulgaris'', these dragons use [[Magic (Discworld)|magic]] to combat the physical laws that would normally kill a flapping-winged creature weighing several tons and spitting burning substances. Because this requires more magic than the Discworld can in normal circumstances provide, ''Draco nobilis'' now exist mostly in a [[parasite universe]] closely connected to the human imagination. They can be briefly released from this universe by a sufficient expenditure of magic, or summoned on a more permanent basis in areas of high [[background magic]]. Examples of this can be found in ''[[The Colour of Magic]]'' and ''[[Guards! Guards!]]''

====''Draco stellaris nauticae''====
The Star-voyaging Dragon is massive even when compared to ''Draco nobilis''. Like ''Draco lunaris'', this species flames from the rear to achieve propulsion. Their food is the various debris they trawl from the voids they travel. Smaller dragons voyage by attaching themselves to the hide of this species, much like the [[remora]]. The species was first observed by [[Leonard of Quirm]] during the events of ''[[The Last Hero]]'', which may mean that they are either quite rare or avoid positioning themselves so as to be visible from the Disc.  A hibernating specimen was viewed by Tethis during his involuntary interstellar sojourn in ''[[The Colour of Magic]]''.

====''Draco vulgaris''====
'''Swamp Dragons''' ''(Draco vulgaris)'' are small, fly badly and tend to explode, due to the generation of various flammable gases in their internal plumbing. They are, in short, [[European dragon|dragons]] as they would have to be in order to work in reality. Swamp dragons are inexplicably popular as pets, and there are a number of different breeds. They will eat and drink anything that can be used as or converted to fuel for fire-breathing (and as such are fond of coal and fuel oil), and they have a corrosive saliva.

A male Swamp Dragon is called a ''pewmet'' between hatching and eight months, a ''cock'' between eight and fourteen months, a ''snood'' between fourteen months and two years, and a ''cobb'' between two years and death. A female Swamp Dragon is called a ''hen'' until her third clutch, and a ''dam'' thereafter. A dead Swamp Dragon of either sex is called a ''crater''. A group of swamp dragons is called either a ''slump'' or an ''embarrassment''. During mating season, male Swamp Dragons will compete when they see each other by attempting to inflate themselves as large as possible (hopefully without exploding). Because of this, dragon owners are discouraged from keeping mirrors.

The portrayal of dragon-breeders (such as [[Sam Vimes#Lady Sybil|Lady Sybil Ramkin]]) in the books is a parody of "horsey" upper-class people, although there are also similarities to pedigree dog-breeding (in particular, the [[Ankh-Morpork]] Cavern Club is a parody of [[Kennel club]]s.) However, due to the nature of the creatures, a dragon house is typically constructed as one would an [[ammunition dump]].

In ''[[The Colour of Magic]]'', a brief line suggests that Swamp Dragons are flightless, flameless and extinct. ''[[GURPS Discworld]]'' suggests this may be a subspecies of the Swamp Dragons seen in later books.

===Drome===
In ''[[The Wee Free Men]]'', '''dromes''' are bizarre, inhuman creatures that inhabit the [[parasite universe]] known as Fairyland.

Dromes are large, blobby grey creatures, much like misshapen [[snowmen]], with grey, doughy flesh, beady eyes and a small, toothless mouth.

Dromes have the unique ability to project and control dreams, trapping their victims within. If someone were to eat anything in the dream, they would be trapped forever until they starve to death. Once dead, the drome eats its victim (but not right away, as they have no teeth). Within a dream, dromes can shapeshift to blend in with their environment, but the one thing they cannot mimic is speech, which sounds like muffled gibberish. When several dromes gather together their powers increase and anyone nearby can be trapped within dreams within dreams within dreams until they are unsure of what is truly real or not. The only way to get out of a drome's dream is to slice off its head.

Dromes originated in a parallel reality; one of many visited by the floating [[parasite universe]] of the Elves. The Elf Queen abducted several of them to aid her in her selfish desires. The homeworld of the dromes is described as a twilight land of red rock against an unmoving sea under a great red sun, populated by crablike creatures, which they eat. This closely echoes the description of the far future Earth described by the protagonist of [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The Time Machine]]''.

===Hermit Elephant===
A native of [[Discworld geography#Continent of Klatch|Howondaland]], the hermit elephant is a close relative of the more commonly known [[elephant]]. However, the hermit elephant has an uncommonly thin and vulnerable skin by comparison to these. In order to protect itself, the hermit elephant will walk into a village, enter a house or hut and lift it upon its back, carrying it away. As it grows, the elephant will periodically shed its house in favor of a new, larger one, much like [[hermit crab]]s. Hermit elephants frequently travel in herds, and these can easily be mistaken for villages if found while the animals are resting. Mentioned in ''[[Men at Arms]]''. Also described in ''[[A Hat Full of Sky]]'' where it states that an entire village of hermit elephants moving across the plains is one of the finest sights on the continent.

===Kickstool crab===
A harmless crustacean creature that inhabits [[List of dimensions of the Discworld|L-space]], and feeds on dust. Mentioned in ''[[Guards! Guards!]]''.

===Land Eel===
Black, slippery eels which slither on land. They are from the dark and mysterious [[Überwald (Discworld)|Überwald]]. They live in deep underground caves, where there is not sunshine, not the lack of light, but the substance of darkness itself. An Überwaldean land eel will emit ''dark light'' when surprised, much as a salamander will emit light. One vampire iconographer in [[Ankh-Morpork]], Otto Chriek, once attempted to use dark light for [[Technology of the Discworld#Iconographs|iconography]]. The results were unreliable in the traditional iconographical sense. Dark light seems to affect the psyche of humans and members of other humanoid species. When used in iconography, dark light seems to illuminate, if such word can be used, a sort of truth, such as who really was in a room a few hours ago, or a father who's constantly watching over a son's shoulder.

===Pointless Albatross===
A species of migratory [[albatross]]. The bird's name refers not to its [[plumage]] but its migration habits, consisting of a series of lazy treks from Hub to Rim deemed pointless by most ornithologists of the Disc. One was sent to Lord Vetinari from the Agatean Empire in ''[[Interesting Times]]'' bearing a message for a "[[Rincewind|Great Wizzard]]". The name is a play on [[wandering albatross]], while its odd migration pattern mimics that of the [[Arctic tern]].

===Quantum Weather Butterfly===
The Quantum Weather Butterfly ("[[papilio]] tempestae") is a butterfly which has evolved the curious trait of localized weather control. This is used as a defense mechanism and a sexual characteristic. The insect is yellow, with [[Mandelbrot set|Mandelbrot]] patterned wings: these wings have an infinite wing perimeter, but only a finite area.  A reference to the [[butterfly effect]], it features mainly in ''[[Interesting Times]]''.

===Republican Bee===
A species of [[honeybee]] that, rather than being ruled by the traditional [[queen bee|queen]], runs its hives as democratic republics. Republican bees "[[committee]] rather than [[swarming (honeybee)|swarm]], and tend to stay in the hive a lot, voting for more honey."

===Salamander===
A small [[lizard]] mostly found in [[desert]]s and other sunny locations, the Salamander is unusual in that it has no [[Body orifice|orifice]]s. It subsists on the magical energy contained in [[Octarine]] wavelengths of light, which it absorbs through its skin. Other wavelengths are also absorbed, but these are not "digested". The salamander must therefore occasionally "excrete" them, producing a bright but short-lived flash of light. [[Technology of the Discworld#Iconographs|Iconographers]] use this effect to enable [[flash (photography)|flash iconography]], by keeping the salamander(s) covered until needed and then scaring them when taking the picture.

===Scalbie===
A shabby and disreputable species of [[seabird]] (actually a corvid, but they won't admit to have it in their family), which looks like it has been in an oil slick, and eats [[carrion]]. The ultimate [[scavenger]], it has been said that not only will scalbies eat things so disgusting they would make a [[vulture]] sick, they will even eat "vulture sick". Appears in ''[[Small Gods (novel)|Small Gods]]''

===Shadowing Lemma===
A creature which exists in only two [[dimension]]s and eats [[mathematician]]s. The name is a reference to the [[shadowing lemma]], a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] from [[dynamical system]]s theory. Mentioned in [[Men at Arms]].

===Vermine===
This small rodent is a more careful variant of the [[lemming]], as it only throws itself off small pebbles. It also [[abseil]]s (rappels) down cliffs and builds rafts to cross lakes. Its fur coat is very valuable (particularly to the creature itself, which will do anything rather than let go of it). Many articles of expensive clothing, such as wizard's robes, tend to be lined with vermine. Its name is a play on [[vermin]] and [[ermine]].

===Vurm===
A small toothless [[scavenger]] [[insect]] native to the deep caves and dwarf mines of [[Uberwald|Überwald]]. They are very patient, and able to digest practically anything with any nutrient value (one character even claims that the exhalations of visitors is food to them). Vurms are [[bioluminescent]], giving off a weak greenish-white glow. Dwarfish [[Dwarfs (Discworld)#Religion|''drudak'ak'']] seem to have a special connection to the creature, possibly using vurm blood to tattoo a luminescent personal identifier (the ''draht'') onto their forearms and apparently spreading the creature intentionally to new mines and territories. The creature is adapted from real-life cave glowworms (see [[Waitomo Glowworm Cave]]). Appears and is named in ''[[Thud!]]'', and may have appeared in ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]''.

===World-bearing Turtle===
{{see|Great A'Tuin}}

==Animal characters==

===The Clan===
The Clan is a tribe of intelligent rats (and one cat) who gained their sentience through consuming the rubbish outside the [[Unseen University]], much like [[Gaspode]]. They make their living by hiring a rather dull-witted young man to serve as their "piper", who then pretends to rid a local town of the rats who then conveniently leave, moving on to the next town.

====Dangerous Beans====
Dangerous Beans is a small [[albino]] rat. He is one of the main characters in ''[[The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents]]''. Dangerous Beans is tiny, rather weak, and nearly blind. He is the most intelligent of the band of Changeling rats. He is quite idealistic and morally pure, which many other rats find puzzling. Due to his intellectual power, he is the only one who can withstand the psychic onslaught of Spider, the terrible [[rat king (folklore)|rat king]].

====Darktan====
Darktan is a Changeling rat who appears in ''[[The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents]]''. He is a tough, battle-hardened rat. Hamnpork, the leader of the rats at the beginning of the book, is wary and afraid of him; it is clear that Darktan, who is in his prime and much more accustomed to being [[sapience|sapient]], is a better leader for the rats. When Hamnpork is trapped in a pit with a terrier, Darktan rescues him by [[bungee jumping]] into the pit and grabbing him. Soon afterward, Darktan is caught in a rat trap and has a [[near death experience]]. When he regains consciousness, he finds that Hamnpork has died. The rats elect him as their new leader and he uses his so-called "meeting with the [[Death of Rats|Bone Rat]]" to rally them into action.

====Maurice====
Maurice, the eponymous character in ''[[The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents]]'', is a [[sapience|sapient]] talking [[cat]]. He has a rather tricky and money-grubbing personality, willing to swindle even his colleagues the Changelings (intelligent rats). However, over the course of the book, he develops a conscience and eventually sacrifices one of his nine lives to save his friend Dangerous Beans. He is last seen at the end of the book setting up a new scam, which seems to be related to the story of [[Dick Whittington]].

===Gaspode===
'''Gaspode''' is a small [[terrier]]-like dog featured in seven novels. He possesses human-level intelligence and the ability to speak, as well as an extensive collection of diseases (including 'Licky end' which is only found in pregnant sheep); he claims that the only reason the diseases haven't killed him is that they're too busy fighting amongst themselves to focus on him. However, since everyone knows that dogs can't speak, people tend to interpret his speech as their own personal thoughts, a tendency which Gaspode regularly uses to wangle food from passers by. (In fact it has been mentioned in the books that a passerby kicked Gaspode into the gutter, and had gone no more than five steps before he thought "I'm a bastard, aren't I"). The exceptions to this are [[Carrot Ironfoundersson]] (who eventually figures out the truth himself), [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Captain Angua von .C3.9Cberwald|Angua]] (whom he tries to court because she's a werewolf), the staff of the Times (whom he needs to pass some information to), and the [[Canting Crew]] (who believe in much stranger things than talking dogs). Gaspode's ability to speak also has uses against other dogs, particularly against the [[misanthropic]] Dog Guild in ''[[Men at Arms]]'', shouting commands in human tongue (e.g. "Sit!", "Bad Dog!") that cause dogs to reflexively respond, in spite of better wishes. Gaspode frequently feels conflict between his desire to be a ''Good Dog'' and his belief that he has to look out for himself, because no one else will. Despite being given a home with happy children and suchlike, he ran away from this for the life he's always known.

As a newborn pup, Gaspode was thrown into the River Ankh in a brick-weighted sack. Since it was the Ankh, Gaspode was subsequently able to crawl ashore and find shelter in an alley, though not before forming a rather confused parental relationship with the brick.

Gaspode originally gained his intelligence and ability to speak in ''[[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]]'' as the result of a "wild idea" which sought to (re)create a Discworld version of [[Hollywood]]. Descended from dogs that fled the destruction of the first appearance of this idea, Gaspode was "selected" to fill the movie role of the Wonder Dog. Unfortunately, he looks nothing like the common conception of what a Wonder Dog is, and so lost the position to Laddie (an obvious [[Lassie]] and [[Lad, A Dog|Lad]] amalgam), whereupon he became an agent for Laddie and the human actors Victor Tugelbend (renamed Victor Maraschino) and Theda "Ginger" Withel (renamed Delores de Syn). After the wild idea was contained/defeated, Gaspode lost the unwanted gifts that had been bestowed on him, and returned to being a homeless street dog.

In ''Men at Arms'', Gaspode has regained his intelligence and speech as a result of sleeping too close to the High Energy Magic Building in [[Unseen University]] and being exposed to [[Discworld (world)#Magic|magical]] seepage. In this and the rest of the books he appears in, Gaspode is portrayed as something like a [[Dickens]]ian urchin, scrambling to survive the harsh life of the streets while maintaining a lovable (if filthy) nature. He has in the past been described as "didn't look as though it could talk but looked as though it could swear". Gaspode becomes the "thinking brain" dog (like a "seeing eye" dog) for [[Discworld characters#Foul Ole Ron|Foul Ole Ron]], and eventually joins the Canting Crew, a group of variably sane homeless people who have, as aforementioned, no difficulty in believing in talking dogs. Overall, within his disreputable appearance, Gaspode has acquired a survivor's intelligence that combines the street smarts of his upbringing with book smarts from reading badly-chewed-up books.

Gaspode also appears in the second Discworld game, ''Trouble with Dragons'', which is largely based on ''Guards! Guards!'' but features Rincewind. He makes a small appearance at the inn where he gives the player trouble by using Rincewind like a doll and let him anger a nearby Sailor.

Gaspode enjoys using his powers of speech to antagonize [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Captain Angua von .C3.9Cberwald|Angua]] and poke fun at her.  During the events of ''Men at Arms'' he often points out that Angua can not hide her attraction to Carrot from him because he can "smell" her feelings.  In one instance, Angua is forced to change into a human with no clothes on, finding herself in Carrot's bedroom, Gaspode tells Carrot to "kiss her", prompting Angua to throw the luckless dog out of the room.

Gaspode is named after "the famous Gaspode", a dog who, upon his master's death, stayed at the graveside howling until he died (possibly because the gravestone was on his tail). This is a reference to [[Greyfriars Bobby]].

===Greebo===
{{hatnote|This section refers to the Discworld character. For the UK subculture term the character is named after, see [[Grebo (music)|Grebo]].}}

'''Greebo''' is a foul-tempered one-eyed grey tomcat whose owner, [[Nanny Ogg]], insists against all the evidence that he is a sweet, harmless kitten. In the course of the books, he has killed two [[vampire]]s, eating at least one of them in the novel ''[[Witches Abroad]]'':
:&lt;blockquote&gt;

''"The bat squirmed under his claw.  It seemed to Greebo's small cat brain that it was trying to change its shape, and he wasn't having any of that from a mouse with wings on."''

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in ''[[Maskerade]]'', Magrat recalls when Greebo once killed an elf.

In ''[[Lords and Ladies (novel)|Lords and Ladies]]'', Greebo's overall attitude is best described in an allusion to [[Schrödinger's cat]]:

:Greebo had spent an irritating two minutes in that box. Technically, a cat locked in a box may be alive or it may be dead. You never know until you look. In fact, the mere act of opening the box will determine the state of the cat, although in this case there were three determinate states the cat could be in: these being Alive, Dead, and Bloody Furious.

:Shawn dived sideways as Greebo went off like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]].

:"Don't worry about him," said Magrat dreamily, as the elf flailed at the maddened cat. "He's just a big softy."

In ''[[Witches Abroad]]'' he was transformed, for reasons that seemed to be a good idea at the time, into a human. He was confused by the differences between human and cat morphology and social relationships, but picked some aspects up quickly. In this incarnation, the character is reminiscent of ''[[Red Dwarf|Red Dwarf's]]'' [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]]; he looks like a 'beautiful, brainless bully' who has raided a leather goods store for the discerning pirate, and appears ready to unbuckle any amount of swash, radiating an aura of raw sex that can be felt several rooms away, and of a [[megawatt]] magnitude. He is typically covered in scars, has retractable nails (or more accurately, claws) and maintains a slitted left eye. When he found a table with masquerade masks, he perused them, selected an orange cat mask and then stating "Always did want to be a ginger."

The incident left him with an unstable [[phenotype]], that is, a tendency to temporarily switch forms when completely cornered, which causes some excitement. In ''[[Maskerade]]'' he once more took longer-term human shape, attending the [[Ankh-Morpork]] [[Opera]] in the guise of the Le Comte de Gribeau.

In a passing reference in ''[[Witches Abroad]]'' Nanny Ogg said that Greebo was a demon ("Just between you and me, he's a fiend from hell"), possibly indicating that Greebo is indeed demonic, partially due to Nanny's insistence otherwise that Greebo is a gentle kitten. This might just refer to Greebo's temperament. It is mentioned in ''[[Wyrd Sisters]]'' that, in addition to his other qualities, he is pursuing a study in [[inbreeding]] with all of the other cats in [[Lancre]] that are related to him (which by dint of some effort is all of them, as he is currently every male ancestor for at least 30 generations), which may be involved in the "raw sex" aura he possesses mentioned above. The same book mentions that he has also seriously surprised a she-bear and chased a female wolf up a tree.

To date, Greebo is known to fear only three things:
*the [[Nac Mac Feegle]] (in ''[[Carpe Jugulum]]'').
*the black cockerel Legba, who belongs to the voodoo witch [[Witches (Discworld)#Erzulie Gogol|Mrs Gogol]] (although this is more of a mutual respect—as the familiars of powerful witches, neither one is going to admit being scared of the other despite Greebo's claws and teeth and Legba's razor-sharp spurs (in ''Witches Abroad'').
*''You'', a small white kitten owned by [[Granny Weatherwax]].  Their first encounter ended with You burying her claws in Greebo's face and his subsequent retreat.  He now hides behind the pots and pans whenever she is in the same house as him (in ''[[Wintersmith]]'').

In Terry Pratchett's [[Johnny Maxwell]] series, Mrs Tachyon owns a cat named Guilty who has many qualities similar to Greebo.

====Reception and legacy====

The [[Cretaceous]] [[conifer]] species ''[[Sciadopityoides greeboana]]'' is named after Greebo.&lt;ref name="greeboana"&gt;Watson, J., Lydon, S. J. and Harrison, N. A. (2001).[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/36952440 "A revision of the English Wealden Flora, III: Czekanowskiales, Ginkgoales &amp; allied Coniferales"]. Bulletin of the Natural History Museum (Geology Series), 57(1), 29-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quoth the Raven===
''See [[Death (Discworld)#Quoth]]''

===Mr. Tiddles===
Mr. Tiddles is a very old cat with a very set routine of walking through the [[Ankh-Morpork Post Office]]. He follows it exactly; if there is an obstruction he will butt against it until the path is clear. When the Post Office burns down in ''Going Postal'' Moist goes back into the burning Post Office to save Mr. Tiddles. Ultimately Mr. Tiddles and Moist are saved by the diligent, unrelenting firefighting efforts of the city's golems, many of them Post Office employees themselves. In ''Making Money'' Moist wonders why he prefers to get up every day at 11:30 AM and move a chair so that Mr. Tiddles can pass by it.  Implied, but not stated, is that he could just move the chair once and leave it in the new, non-obstructing position.

===Wuffles===
A small dog of indeterminate breed belonging to the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, Lord Vetinari. By the time of ''[[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]]'' he is sixteen years old, and has a rather interesting smell ("It's his teeth...")
He partially foils the attempt to discredit the Patrician by attacking and biting one of the perpetrators of the deed, and his subsequent evidence (interpreted by Gaspode) helps to uncover the plot.

By the time the events of ''[[Going Postal]]'' occur Wuffles has died, and is buried in the grounds of the Patrician's Palace. Lord Vetinari leaves dog biscuits on his grave. Seeing as this is one of the few instances where Vetinari shows any emotion, this implies a very strong bond between them.

==Flora==

===Apples===
Apples in the Discworld include the [[Lancre]] Blackheart, the Golden Disagreeable, and the Green [[Unseen University#Drum Billet|Billet]] (which goes immediately from ripe to rotten upon being picked). All these varieties are used to make Scumble.

In "[[The Sea and Little Fishes]]" a variety called Nanny Ogg is invented, a play on [[Granny Smith]]. After a chain of events, a breed of onion called [[Granny Weatherwax]] also appears.

====Scumble====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cider]] --&gt;
An alcoholic beverage made of mostly apples and drunk in very small cups some months apart.

It was first introduced in ''[[Mort]]'' which tells us:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A lot of stories are told about scumble,  and how it is made out on the damp marshes, according to ancient recipes passed down rather unsteadily from father to son. It's not true about the rats, or the snakes' heads, or the lead shot. The one about the dead sheep is a complete fabrication. We can lay to rest all the variants of the one about the trouser button. But the one about not letting it come into contact with metal is absolutely true..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Mort'' it was drunk on the [[Sto Plains]], but in later books it is associated with [[Lancre]], where it is distilled by [[Nanny Ogg]] (whose particular variant is known as "Suicider"). The consumption of scumble in Lancre has earned the populace of the area a reputation for having "Four brain cells, huddling together for warmth". The word scumble is a pun on the West Country cider known as [[List of ciders by country#The West Country of England|scrumpy]], but scumble is clearly stronger than cider and distilled, therefore it is the Discworld version of [[Applejack (beverage)|applejack]].

When scumble is mixed with dwarfish beer, it creates a highly intoxicating cocktail known as "[[Snakebite (beer cocktail)|Fluff]]".

Scumble is unable to be watered down and usually served in small thimble sized wooden cups.

===Counting pines===
The only known example of borrowed evolution, counting pines alter their genetic code to adapt to outside forces. This unique ability has run into a snag when dealing with humans however. When humans first started cutting them down, the counting pines assumed that they wished to count their rings, and so adapted by displaying their age in numbers on their trunks. Unfortunately, this adaptation led to their being nearly exterminated by the demand for exotic house number-plates.&lt;ref name="KirbyPratchett1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pratchett|first1=Terry|last2=Kirby|first2=Josh|title=Reaper Man|series=Discworld series|year=1991|publisher=Victor Gollancz|location=London|isbn=0-575-04979-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-annual plant===
In addition to the more common [[annual plant]]s, [[biennial plant]]s and [[perennial plant]]s, [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]] harbors a small number of re-annual plants. These are plants which, due to a rare 4-dimensional twist in their genetic structure, flower and grow before their seed germinates. This is usually only possible in areas with considerable amounts of [[background magic]]. Farmers who grow re-annual plants are usually very careful about dates of sowing, lest they cause devastating temporal paradoxes (such as dying of starvation because the food one lived off months ago was never grown). ''[[The Discworld Almanak]]'' also mentions how a garden implement carelessly strewn among re-annuals months later can cause serious damage today.

When re-annual plant products undergo [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]], the product is time-reversed alcohol (such as counterwise wine), a rare substance much sought by fortune-tellers and the like, as ingesting it allows some ability to foretell the future, which from the point of view of the plant is the past. Time-reversed alcohol produces inebriation in the normal way, but the [[hangover]] is thrust backwards in time to several hours before the actual ingestion of the alcohol.&lt;ref name="Pratchett1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratchett|first=Terry|title=Pyramids; a Discworld Novel|year=1996|publisher=Corgi Books|location=London|isbn=0-552-13461-9|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as a hangunder, and is usually very strong since one feels so dreadful one imbibes large amounts of alcohol to get over it.

The only revealed re-annual plants are the vul nut vine, which is remarkable in that it can begin to flower as much as eight years before being sown; and re-annual grapes (the source of counterwise wine), which are harvested a year in advance of being sown.&lt;ref name="Pratchett1996"/&gt;

===Sapient pearwood===
A type of semi-intelligent wood that grows in areas of high residual magic. Impervious to magic, it is used in the manufacture of wizards' staffs. Mostly extinct outside the [[Agatean Empire]] where it is still quite common, and used to make a number of aggressively ill-tempered artifacts, such as [[The Luggage]] in [[Colour of Magic]]. An artifact made of sapient pearwood will follow its owner ''anywhere''. One of its earliest uses was in the manufacture of [[grave goods]] for which the well-worn phrase "You can't take it with you" is manifestly incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Wahoonie===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ankh-Morpork]] --&gt;
A fruit that grows in [[Discworld geography#Continent of Klatch|Howondaland]]. It is highly prized by connoisseurs as they rarely prize something common; the colour (earwax) and smell (like a sick anteater) make most people feel ill. It is also covered in spikes.

Its name may be based on the poisonous [[Euonymus|wahoo]] fruit, although the description is similar to the [[durian]].

[[Ankh-Morpork]] is known as the Big Wahoonie, although the fruit does not smell ''that'' bad.&lt;ref name="Pratchett1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratchett|first=Terry|title=Moving Pictures|year=1990|publisher=Gollancz|location=London|isbn=0-575-04763-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wow-Wow sauce====
A [[parody]] of [[Wow-Wow sauce|the real world sauce of the same name]]. The Discworld version was invented by an uncle of [[Mustrum Ridcully]], and its ingredients include grated [[#Wahoonie|wahoonie]], [[asafoetida]], [[#Scumble|scumble]], [[sulfur|sulphur]] and [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]]. It is a highly unstable substance and believed to be responsible (when combined with a [[charcoal biscuit]] and an after-dinner [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]]) for the elder Ridcully's explosive death. (See [[Black powder]] for why the combination might be problematic.) A presumably different uncle of Ridcully's used to swear by (or rather, swear at) Wow-Wow Sauce as a [[hangover]] cure; according to Ridcully, "He seemed very peaceful when they came to lay him out". Ridcully also advised that Wow-Wow Sauce must never be consumed when sweat is condensing on the bottle (a reference to the danger posed by [[dynamite]] that has begun to sweat its [[nitroglycerin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pratchett|first1=Terry|last2=Briggs|first2=Stephen|title=[[The Discworld Companion]]|edition=2nd|year=1997|publisher=Books Britain|isbn=0-575-60030-6|pages=450–452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Green Energy (Definition and Promotion) Act 2009''' (c 19) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The Act is intended to reduce [[carbon emissions]] in order to reduce [[climate change]], to increase the diversity and security of energy supplies, to reduce [[fuel poverty]], and to contribute to meeting the [[EU 2020 renewable energy targets]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmbills/123/en/09123x--.htm Explanatory notes to the Bill], paragraph 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Section 1 - Definition and promotion of green energy==
Sections 1(2) and (3) define the expression "green energy" for the purposes of this Act.

==Sections 2 to 4==
These sections make provision for the promotion of [[microgeneration]].

==Section 5 - Interpretation==
This section defines the words and expressions "dwellinghouse", "energy efficiency measure", "equipment", "fuel poverty", "the GPDO" and "renewable or low-carbon source" for the purposes of the Act.

==Section 6 - Short title, commencement and extent==
Section 6(1) authorises the citation of the Act by a [[short title]]. 

Section 6(2) provides that the Act came into force at the end of the period of two months that began on the day that it was passed. The word "months" means [[calendar month]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Interpretation Act 1978]], section 5 and Schedule 1&lt;/ref&gt; The day (that is to say, 12 November 2009) on which the Act was passed (that is to say, received royal assent) is included in the period of two months.&lt;ref&gt;Hare v Gocher [1962] 2 QB 641, [1962] 2 All ER 673; Trow v Ind Coope (West Midlands) Ltd [1967] 2 QB 899 at 909, [1967] 2 All ER 900, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]].&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the Act came into force on 12 January 2010.

Section 6(3) provides for its extent.

'''Heath forest''' is a type of [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forest]] found in areas with acidic, sandy soils that are extremely nutrient-poor. Notable examples are the [[Rio Negro campinarana]] of the [[Amazon Basin]] in [[South America]], and the [[Sundaland heath forests]] (also known as ''Kerangas'' forests) of [[Borneo]] and neighboring islands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">The '''Irish Peatland Conservation Council''' (IPCC; {{Lang-ga|Comhairle Chaomhnaithe Phortaigh na hÉireann}}) is a national charitable organisation established in 1982 to conserve and protect a representative sample of [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] bogs,&lt;ref name=aboutipcc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ie/aboutIPCC.html|title=Who we are|publisher=Irish Peatland Conservation Council|accessdate=19 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831045357/http://www.ipcc.ie/aboutIPCC.html|archivedate=31 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to campaign on bog-related issues.

==History==
Having been for many years in Dublin city centre, the Council's headquarters are currently located at the [[Bog of Allen]] Nature Centre, [[Lullymore]], [[Rathangan, County Kildare|Rathangan]], [[Co. Kildare]]. The Bog of Allen Nature Centre was acquired by IPCC in 2003{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and since then work has been ongoing to develop an internationally recognised centre for peatland conservation, education and research.

==Membership==
The ''Friend of the Bog'' scheme is one means by which members of the public can become involved in and help the Save the Bogs Campaign. Other fundraising methods include special appeals, sale of symbolic share certificates in Irish bogs, a ''Save the Bogs'' card and gift catalogue, raffles, open days and sales of work, visits to the Bog of Allen Nature Centre.

==Objectives==
IPCC's conservation aims and objectives are set out in a series of Action Plans, the most recent being ''Bogs and Fens of Ireland Conservation Plan 2005''. An account of the first fifteen years of the Save the Bogs Campaign is contained in ''Save the Bogs Story'', with all IPCC publications orderable through the charity's website [http://www.ipcc.ie].  IPCC also produces a twice-yearly campaign newsletter Peatland News which goes out to ''Friends of the Bog''.

The IPCC is a registered charity, It is not state-funded and so relies on public support to ensure its independence and influence.&lt;ref name="aboutipcc"/&gt; The IPCC is a member of the [[Irish Environmental Network]], a network of Ireland's environmental [[NGOs]].

'''Kanjli Wetland''', a man made Wetland, which subsumes the '''Kanjli Lake''',  located in the [[Kapurthala district]] of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] state in [[India]], was created in 1870 by constructing the headworks across the perennial Bien River, a tributary of the [[Beas River]] to provide irrigation facilities to the hinterland. The rich biodiversity of the wetland comprising [[Aquatic plant|aquatic]], [[mesophytic]] and [[Terrestrial plant|terrestrial]] [[flora]] and [[fauna]] including some important species of plants and animals was recognized internationally by the [[Ramsar Convention]] in 2002 by designating the Kanjli Lake in the List of [[Wetland]]s of International Importance.&lt;ref name = info&gt;[http://www.ramsar.org/ris/ris_india_kanjli.htm Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands (RIS) -- India, Kanjli, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it is reported that the Punjab State which has 14 wetlands covering an area of 225.76&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (2% of the geographical area of the State) has the unique position of three of its wetlands viz., the Kanjli Wetland covering an area of 490 ha of which the Kanjli Lake water spread is 184 ha), the Harike Wetland (4100 ha) and the Ropar Wetland (1365 ha) chosen by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoE&amp;F), [[Government of India]] for their conservation and management are now also included in the Ramsar list covering a total area of 5650 ha; Kanjli is upstream of Harike wetland located in the Beas river basin while the [[Ropar]] wetland is in the Roopnagar district.&lt;ref name = map&gt;[http://www.gisdevelopment.net/aars/acrs/1997/ps1/ps2004.aspMapping and Monitoring of Natural Resources of Kanjli Wetland Ecosystem (Punjab) India-An Integrated Approach for its Conservation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlakes.org/uploads/Management_of_lakes_in_India_10Mar04.pdf Management of Lakes in India]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wetland ==
{{Main|Wetland}}
The Kanjli Wetland is one of the manmade wetlands in India identified by the Government of India, as per the Expert Group’s (set up in 1983 by the Ministry of Environment and Forests) report published in 1990. Since the main article on [[Wetland]] does not cover the aspects of Indian wetlands, the work done in this regard in [[India]] is explained. The Expert Group has based its directory on the basis of the definition enunciated by the Ramsar International Convention on Wetlands:&lt;ref&gt;[http://envfor.nic.in/divisions/csurv/Wetland%20Inventory.pdf Inventory of Wetlands]&lt;/ref&gt;

" areas of [[marsh]], [[fen]], [[peatland]], or water whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] water the depth of which at low [[tide]] does not exceed six metres".

Further, considering the definition of wetlands given by Cowden in 1979 for classification of wetlands in the US, three key attributes of hydrology (the degree of flooding or soil saturation), wetland vegetation (hydrophytes) and hydric soils have also been considered for identification. In this list, [[mangroves]] are not included since it falls under a separate category.

The Expert Group's directory has made a distinction between Natural and Man-Made wetlands (including wetlands of less than 100 ha area). In India, in its 24 states and two union territories (as per the 1990 report), there are 2167 nos of natural wetlands with a total area of 1.45 million ha and Man-Made wetlands of 65,254 nos with total area of 2.59 million ha. The inland water bodies listed in the report covers [[lake]]s, [[tanks]], [[reservoirs]] etc.

==Royal patronage==
The erstwhile Maharaja of Kapurthala (Raja Randhir Singh - 1862 to 1870), built the headworks on the river Kali Bein which resulted in the creation of the Kanjli Wetland which subsumes the sparkling lake by the same name. The [[Maharaja]] also built a retreat, in the [[France|French]] architectural style, in the forest set in lovely natural scenery, on the banks of the Lake, which was named "The Villa" or the "Villa Buona Vista". His royal successors live in this retreat even now.
The lake has been developed as a tourist destination with facilities for fishing and boating. A traditional [[Mela]] or exhibition is held here during [[Depavali]] festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsofindia.com/punjab/tourism/kanjliwetland.htmlKanjli Wetland, Kapurtala]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kapurthalaonline.com/touristattractions/touristattractions2.shtml Tourist Attractions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
{{Further|Kapurthala}}
The Kanjli ecological Wetland region around the village Kanjli is {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Kapurthala town, also the district headquarters, and is thus well connected by road network to all parts of the state and rest of the country.&lt;ref name = map/&gt;

== Hydrology ==
The Kali Bein River, originating near village Dhanoa, upstream of Budho Bark Regulator in [[Hoshiarpur District]], formerly a main tributary of the Beas River feeds the Wetland and the Lake. The Bien has now become an independent river due to [[siltation]] and westward swing of the [[Beas River]]. Agricultural development dominates the catchment of the wetland. The Bien river has contributed to the formation of fertile plains by bringing down large [[sediment]] loads during floods. Depth of water in the Lake has a seasonal variation of 3.05 m (10 feet) to 7.62 m (25 feet) depending on the season and inflow discharge. Catchment area is mainly under agriculture. The wetland is in the semi-arid zone and receives an average annual rainfall of about 620&amp;nbsp;mm. The temperature varies from a maximum of 45&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; C in summer to an average of 6&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;C during winter with occasionally freezing temperatures.

The Kali Bein and its wetland provide water supply for agriculture in the Kapurthala district, recharges the ground water, drains excessive rainwater from sensitive crops like [[wheat]], [[potato]], etc. and acts as a sponge by absorbing the [[flood]] waters.&lt;ref name =kanj&gt;[http://envfor.nic.in/divisions/csurv/Wetland%20Inventory.pdf], Inventory of Wetlands, Kanjli, p. 332-343&lt;/ref&gt;

== Water quality ==
The water and [[sludge]] quality of the Wetland has been studied by the Punjab Pollution Control Board Their report indicates that quality generally conforms to Class 'B' with some degree of quality degradation to Class 'D' sometimes during December.&lt;ref name =kanj/&gt;

From a [[satellite imagery]] study of the wetland it has been inferred that Kanjli Lake could be categorised under low [[turbidity]] class (dark blue hue) during pre-monsoon period and moderate turbidity class (medium blue) during post monsoon season which is indicative of regimentation occurring in the lake during post [[monsoon]] season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gisdevelopment.net/aars/acrs/1997/ps1/ps2004a.asp Mapping and Monitoring of Natural Resources of Kanjli Wetland Ecosystem (Punjab) India-An Integrated Approach for its Conservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
The flora and fauna recorded in the Wetland and the Kanjli Lake within it (Some of them are pictured in the gallery) are the following.&lt;ref name =kanj/&gt;

=== Flora ===
* Twelve varieties of trees recorded in the wetland are   ''[[Acacia arabica]]'', ''[[Albizia lebbeck]]'', ''[[Azadirachta indica]]'', ''[[Dalbergia sissoo]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' hybrid, ''[[Ficus bengalensis]]'', ''[[Mangifera indica]]'', ''[[Melia azedarach]]'', ''[[Morus alba]]'', ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'', ''[[Syzygium cumini]]'' and ''[[Ziziphus mauritiana]]''.
* Shrubs recorded are: ''[[Calotropis procera]]'', ''[[Ipomoea]] crassicaulis'' and ''[[Tamarix]] dioca''
* Herbs noted are ''[[Saccharum munja]]'', ''[[Saccharum spontaneum]]'', ''[[Scirpus]]'' sp. and other common herbs.

===Aqua flora===
11 species of aquaflora, 34 species of [[zooplankton]] and 15 species of macro [[invertebrate]]s have been reported.

=== Aqua fauna ===
According to the District Gazetteer and the study done by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), 17 fish species (in Bein river and the lake) have been reported which includes the common fish species of ''[[Catla catla]]'', ''[[Channa marulius]]'' (great snakehead), ''[[Cythus striatus]]'', ''[[Cirrhinus mrigala]]'', ''[[Labeo calbasu]]'' and ''[[Labeo rohita]]''.

The [[tortoise]] is the common reptile reported in the area.

There are twenty-eight resident bird species and nine migratory species. The migratory birds are various species of [[goose]], [[white-eyed pochard]], [[wigeon]], [[tufted pochard]], [[common teal]], large whistling [[teal]], [[northern pintail|pintail]], [[mallard]] and [[shoveller]].

===Fauna===
The mammals in the wetland are the [[Indian civet]], [[mongoose]], [[Indian porcupine]], [[squirrel]] and [[Indian hare|common Indian hare]].

== Problems in the wetland ==
In the Wetland, the ecological status of the Kanjli lake, in particular, has been threatened on account of the following issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gisdevelopment.net/aars/acrs/1997/ps1/ps2004b.asp Mapping and Monitoring of Natural Resources of Kanjli Wetland Ecosystem (Punjab) India-An Integrated Approach for its Conservation]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Extensive growth of [[water hyacinth]] due nutrients and pesticides from adjoining agricultural fields
* [[Human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] pressure and consequent land encroachment
* [[Eutrophication]], particularly due to in-situ decay of hyacinth
* Conversion of wetland for agriculture, human habitation, industrial expansion and recreational activities
* Illegal and indiscriminate fishing causing disturbance to bird life

== Conservation measures ==
The conservation and management measures undertaken with assistance provided by the Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests, Govt. of India (MoEF, GOI) by the Environment Division of the Punjab State Council for Science &amp; Technology under the directive of the State Level Steering Committee are the following.&lt;ref name =kanj/&gt;
* Detailed mapping of the wetland for declaring and notifying the Kanjli Wetland as protected area under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.
* Judicious hyacinth (weed) control by the irrigation department, district police, and even army units, by manual methods. Conveyor belt system as a mechanical method to clear the weeds is also being tried.
* Hyacinth control through biological control by releasing two weevil species (which have proved been found effective worldwide and introduced in the downstream in the Harike Wetland Ecosystem) of ''[[Neochetina]] bruchi'' and ''N. eichorniae''. Release of the moth ''[[Sameodes albiguittal]]'' is also being considered as an option.
* Introduction of more fish species in the lake judiciously to avoid any adverse effects of exotic species.
* Afforestation measures around the lake area and in the small islands, with mixed indigenous species of trees to prevent soil erosion resulting in siltation reduction in the lake, to attract large species of birds to nest and roost and to enhance the ecosystem.
* Selective Fencing of the Wetland to prevent excessive grazing to preservation of important pockets provide habitat for wading birds and to check encroachments
* Monitoring of water quality continuously to check the degree of external nutrient loading of the lake waters and to evolve appropriate preventive and curative steps
* Public awareness campaigns through mass-media, educational material, camps, etc. of the wetland eco system with the help of Voluntary Organizations
* Continued scientific research on Biological and hydrological components, and Productivity potential with respect of economic value, social aspects of heritage and to rate the significance of the wetland.
* A team of five students from a local university have been in reclamation activities

== Sikh tradition ==
{{Further|Sikhism}}
[[Sikh]] tradition states that at the age of thirty, [[Nanak]] went missing and was presumed to have drowned after going for one of his morning baths to a local stream called the '''Kali Bein'''. Three days later he reappeared and would give the same answer to any question posed to him: "There is no [[Hindu]], there is no [[Muslim]]" (in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], "nā kōi hindū nā kōi musalmān"). It was from this moment that [[Nanak]] would begin to spread the teachings of what was then the beginning of [[Sikhism]].

'''Land degradation''' is a process in which the value of the [[biophysical environment]] is affected by a combination of [[Human impact on the environment|human-induced processes]] acting upon the land.&lt;ref name="rural"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rural Land Degradation in Australia |last=Conacher |first=Arthur |authorlink= |author2=Conacher, Jeanette  |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press Australia |location=South Melbourne, Victoria |isbn=0-19-553436-0 |page=2 }}

Journal of Environmental Quality 26: 581-589.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural hazard]]s are excluded as a cause; however human activities can indirectly affect phenomena such as floods and bush fires.

This is considered to be an important topic of the [[21st century]] due to the implications land degradation has upon [[agronomic productivity]], the environment, and its effects on [[food security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = H. | last = Eswaran | author2 = R.

==Measures==
There are four main ways of looking at land degradation and its impact on the environment around it:

#A temporary or permanent decline in the [[productive capacity]] of the land. This can be seen through a loss of [[biomass]], a loss of actual productivity or in potential productivity, or a loss or change in [[vegetative cover]] and [[soil nutrient]]s.
#Action in the land's capacity to provide resources for human livelihoods. This can be measured from a base line of past land use.
#Loss of [[biodiversity]]: A loss of range of species or ecosystem complexity as a decline in the environmental quality.
#Shifting ecological risk: increased vulnerability of the environment or people to destruction or crisis. This is measured through a base line in the form of pre-existing risk of crisis or destruction.

A problem with defining land degradation is that what one group of people might view as degradation, others might view as a benefit or opportunity. For example, planting [[crop]]s at a location with heavy [[rainfall]] and steep slopes would create scientific and environmental concern regarding the risk of [[Soil erosion#Rainfall and runoff|soil erosion by water]], yet  farmers could view the location as a favourable one for high [[crop yield]]s.&lt;ref name="landguide" /&gt;

==Different types ==
[[File:A potato field with soil erosion.jpg|thumb|Potato field with soil erosion]]
In addition to the usual types of land degradation that have been known for centuries (water, wind and mechanical [[erosion]], physical, chemical and [[biological degradation]]), four other types have emerged in the last 50 years:&lt;ref&gt;Brabant Pierre, 2010. [http://www.csf-desertification.eu/dossier/item/a-land-degradation-assessment-and-mapping-method A land degradation assessment and mapping method. A standard guideline proposal]. ''Les dossiers thématiques du CSFD. ''N°8. November 2010. CSFD/Agropolis International, Montpellier, France. 52 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[pollution]], often chemical, due to [[industrial agriculture|agricultural]], industrial, [[mining]] or commercial activities;
* [[land loss|loss]] of arable land due to [[urbanization|urban construction]], [[road building]], [[land conversion]], [[agricultural expansion]], etc.;
* [[artificial radioactivity]], sometimes accidental;
* land-use constraints associated with [[armed conflict]]s.
Overall, more than 36 types of land degradation can be assessed. All are induced or aggravated by human activities, e.g. [[sheet erosion]], [[silting]], [[aridification]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], [[urbanization]], etc.

==Causes==
[[File:Cattle.jpg|thumb|Overgrazing by [[livestock]] can lead to land degradation]]
Land degradation caused by mining as it cause landslides
Land degradation is a global problem largely related to [[Agriculture|agricultural]] use. Causes include:

* Land clearance, such as [[clearcutting]] and [[deforestation]]
* Agricultural depletion of soil [[nutrient]]s through poor farming practices
* [[Livestock]] including [[overgrazing]] and [[overdrafting]]
* Inappropriate [[irrigation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review  | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18–34 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[overdrafting]]
* [[Urban sprawl]] and commercial development
* Vehicle [[off-roading]]
*[[Quarry]]ing of stone, sand, ore and minerals
* Increase in field size due to [[economies of scale]], reducing shelter for wildlife, as [[hedgerow]]s and [[copse]]s disappear
* Exposure of naked soil after harvesting by heavy equipment
* [[Monoculture]], destabilizing the local ecosystem
* Dumping of non-[[biodegradable]] trash, such as [[plastics]]
* Invasive Species
*[[Soil degradation]], e.g.
** [[Soil contamination]] 
** [[Soil erosion]]
** [[Soil acidification]]
** Loss of [[soil carbon]]

==Effects==
[[File:Erosion.jpg|thumb|160px|Soil erosion in a [[wheat]] field near [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], US]]
[[Overcutting]] of vegetation occurs when people cut forests, woodlands and shrublands—to obtain [[timber]], [[fuelwood]] and other products—at a pace [[ecological debt|exceeding the rate of natural regrowth]]. This is frequent in semi-arid environments, where [[fuelwood]] shortages are often severe. 
 
[[Overgrazing]] is the grazing of natural pastures at stocking intensities above the livestock [[carrying capacity]]; the resulting decrease in the vegetation cover is a leading cause of wind and water erosion. It is a significant factor in Afghanistan. The growing population pressure, during 1980-1990, has led to decreases in the already small areas of agricultural land per person in six out of eight countries (14% for India and 21% for Pakistan).

[[Population pressure]] also operates through other mechanisms. Improper agricultural practices, for instance, occur only under constraints such as the saturation of good lands under population pressure which leads settlers to cultivate too shallow or too steep soils, plough fallow land before it has recovered its fertility, or attempt to obtain multiple crops by irrigating unsuitable soils.

High population density is not always related to land degradation. Rather, it is the practices of the human population that can cause a landscape to become degraded. Populations can be a benefit to the land and make it more productive than it is in its natural state. Land degradation is an important factor of internal displacement in many African and Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;Terminski, Bogumil, Towards Recognition and Protection of Forced Environmental Migrants in the Public International Law: Refugee or IDPs Umbrella (December 1, 2011). Policy Studies Organization (PSO) Summit, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Severe land degradation affects a significant portion of the Earth's arable lands, decreasing the wealth and [[economic development]] of nations. As the land resource base becomes less productive, [[food security]] is compromised and competition for dwindling [[resource]]s increases, the seeds of [[famine]] and potential conflict are sown.

==Sensitivity and resilience==
Sensitivity and [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] are measures of the vulnerability of a landscape to degradation. These two factors combine to explain the degree of vulnerability.&lt;ref name="landguide"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Stockings, Mike |author2=Murnaghan, Niamh. | title = Land Degradation - Guidelines for Field Assessment | year = 2000 | location = Norwich, UK | pages = 7–15 | url = http://146.83.42.209/manuel_casanova/Conserva2011/Stocking_COMPLETE.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitivity is the degree to which a land system undergoes change due to natural forces, human intervention or a combination of both. Resilience is the ability of a landscape to absorb change, without significantly altering the relationship between the relative importance and numbers of individuals and species that compose the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Johnson, Douglas |author2=Lewis, Lawrence. | title = Land Degradation; Creation and Destruction | year = 2007 | location = Maryland, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to the ability of the region to return to its original state after being changed in some way. The resilience of a landscape can be increased or decreased through human interaction based upon different methods of land-use management. Land that is degraded becomes less resilient than undegraded land, which can lead to even further degradation through shocks to the landscape.

==Climate change==
Significant land degradation from [[seawater]] [[inundation]], particularly in [[river delta]]s and on low-lying islands, is a potential hazard that was identified in a 2007 [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/mains3-3-2.html report].{{IPCC|date=September 2008}} As a result of [[sea-level rise]] from climate change, salinity levels can reach levels where agriculture becomes impossible in very low-lying areas.

'''Lhamo Latso''' or '''Lha-mo La-tso''' ({{bo|t=ལྷ་མོའི་བླ་མཚོ།|w=Lha mo'i bla mtsho}}) is a small oval oracle lake where senior [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] [[bhikkhu|monks]] of the [[Gelug]] sect go for visions to assist in the discovery of [[reincarnation]]s of the [[Dalai Lama]]s. Other pilgrims also come to seek visions. It is considered to be the most sacred lake in Tibet.&lt;ref name="Lhamo Latso Lake"&gt;[http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-city/China/Lhamo%20La-tso,%20Tibet/tpod.html "Lhamo Latso Lake"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830181403/http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-city/China/Lhamo%20La-tso,%20Tibet/tpod.html |date=2016-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palden Lhamo and Lhamo Latso==
[[File:Palden Lhamo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Palden Lhamo]]
It is said that Palden Lhamo, as the female guardian spirit of the Lhamo Latso promised the [[1st Dalai Lama]] in one of his visions "that she would protect the reincarnation lineage of the Dalai Lamas." Ever since the time of the [[2nd Dalai Lama]], who formalised the system, the regents and other monks have gone to the lake to seek guidance on choosing the next reincarnation through visions while meditating there.&lt;ref name=Laird&gt;{{cite book|last=Laird|first=Thomas|title=The story of Tibet : conversations with the Dalai Lama|date=2006|publisher=Grove Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8021-1827-1|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular form of Palden Lhamo at Lhamo Latso is Jemo Maksoma ({{bo|w=rgyal mo dmag zor ma}}, "The Victorious Queen who Turns Back Enemies". The lake is sometimes referred to as "Palden Lhamo ''Kalideva''", which indicates that she is the (Buddhist) emanation of [[Kali]], [[shakti]] of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name =Dowman/&gt;  Jemo Maksoma, also called '''Machik Pellha Shiwé Nyamchen''' ({{bo|w=Ma gcig dPal lha Zhi ba'i Nyams can}}), this is an unusually peaceful form of Palden Lhamo.&lt;ref name=Dowman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dowman|first1=Keith|title=The power-places of Central Tibet : the pilgrim's guide|date=1988|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-7102-1370-0}}, pp. 78, 260, 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain to the south of [[Chokorgyel Monastery]], ''Shridevi'', is the "blue" residence of Palden Lhamo on which a [[sky burial]] site is located.&lt;ref name=Dowman/&gt; The monastery was originally built in a triangular form to reflect the symbolism of its position at the confluence of three rivers and surrounded by three mountains and also represents the conjunction of the three elements of water, earth and fire, as well as the female principle of Palden Lhamo in the form of an inverted triangle.&lt;ref name=Dowman/&gt;
{{quote|Lhamo Latso... [is] a brilliant azure jewel set in a ring of grey mountains.

[[Chokorgyel Monastery]] itself is about {{Convert|115|km}} northeast of [[Tsetang]] and about {{Convert|160|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Lhasa, at an altitude of {{convert|4500|m}}.&lt;ref name="Laird, Thomas 2006 p. 139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayhew 2005 pp. 158-159"/&gt;

The old path from Chokorgyel Monastery used to be paved to make access easier for the senior monks wishing to visit the lake. Halfway along is a diamond-shaped pond fed by glaciers known as [[Yoni]] Lake. On a ridge near the top of the pass overlooking the lake a ritual ''shökde'' or throne was built for the Dalai Lama, where he once sat to divine the future while gazing into the lake about {{convert|1|km}} in front and {{convert|150|m}} lower down. Nowadays it is buried under a mound of silk scarves (''hadak'').&lt;ref name="Mayhew 2005 p. 159"&gt;Mayhew, Bradley and Kohn, Michael. (2005) ''Tibet''. 6th Edition, p. 159. {{ISBN|1-74059-523-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pilgrims come each year to Lhamo Latso believing that, with proper devoutness, and after fasting for three days and refraining from talk, they will be rewarded with a revelation of their future in the skull-shaped mirror of the lake.&lt;ref name="Lhamo Latso Lake"/&gt;   Previously there was a temple to Jemo Maksoma at the eastern end of the lake; the site is now marked only by prayer flags and offerings left by pilgrims.&lt;ref name="Mayhew 2005 p. 159"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dowman/&gt;

There is a [[Kora (pilgrimage)|kora]] (circumambulatory pilgrimage) around Lhamo La-tso.&lt;ref name="Mayhew 2005 p. 159"/&gt;

This is a list of '''animals''' that appeared in [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]], the world of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] [[legendarium]]. In addition, this list encompasses several living creatures that were referred to at some point by Tolkien as being beast-shaped [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]] (angelic beings) rather than proper animals; such cases are annotated.

In [[Quenya]], an [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elven]] tongue devised by Tolkien, the general term for animals, as distinct from plants (''[[List of Middle-earth plants|olvar]]''), is '''''kelvar'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Silm|Ch. 2 "Of Aulë and Yavanna"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional species==

===Fictional bird species===

====Crebain====
''Crebain'' (singular: ''craban'') were a large species of [[crow]] that inhabited the land of [[Dunland]] during the [[Third Age]]. They were often used as servants and spies by various evil powers, notably [[Saruman]]. During the [[War of the Ring]], a flock of ''crebain'' searched for the [[Ring-bearer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|FR|Book II Ch. 3 "The Ring Goes South"}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Crebain'' "crows" would be the regular plural form of [[Sindarin]] ''*craban'' "crow," a word which (while unattested) seems to have been adopted by Tolkien from Indo-European languages, particularly a pre-Germanic form ''*krabn-'', whence the [[proto-Germanic]] ''*hrabnaz'',&lt;ref&gt;Calvert Watkins, American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots&lt;/ref&gt; from which descended both [[Old High German]] ''hraban'' and English ''raven''.

====Elven-birds====
A species of songbirds native to [[Tol Eressëa]]. The birds mated for life, and were described as "grey, with golden beaks and feet". A pair of Elven-birds was gifted to [[Erendis]] on her wedding to [[Aldarion]], the crown-prince of [[Númenor]]. She later dismissed the birds when their marriage broke down.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Tolkien (1980), ''[[Unfinished Tales]], George Allen &amp; Unwin, part 2, ch.2 'Aldarion and Erendis', pp.189-190, 193; {{ISBN|0-04-823179-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Great Eagles====
{{Main|Eagle (Middle-earth)}}
A race of eagles of outstanding size, believed to have been sent to Middle-earth and Númenor by [[Manwë]]. Tolkien proposed variously that they had been either [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]] or just highly intelligent animals.

====Kirinki====
One of the many species of birds found in [[Númenor]] that were not known in Middle-earth. The ''kirinki'' are said to have been smaller than [[Eurasian wren|wrens]], with scarlet feathers and "piping voices on the edge of human hearing".&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|UT|"A Description of Númenor"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ravens of Erebor====
The ravens of Erebor (the [[Lonely Mountain]]) were a type of [[Common raven|raven]] that could converse with humans. They were also extremely long-lived: [[#Roäc|Roäc]] was aged 153 when he was met in ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Their main rookery was on [[Ravenhill (Middle-earth)|Ravenhill]] on a spur of the Mountain. They often assisted the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] of Erebor by providing messengers.

===Fictional mammal species===
====Kine of Araw====
White [[ox]]en that lived near the inland [[Sea of Rhûn]], called thus by the men of [[Gondor]], who associated them with the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Vala]] [[Oromë]] or Araw, "the huntsman of the Valar".&lt;ref&gt;''The Return of the King", Appendix A (ii), p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vorondil]] (Steward to King [[Eärnil II]] of [[Gondor]], {{ME-date|TA|1998}}-2029) hunted these beasts, and fashioned a horn for blowing from one of them. It became an heirloom of the [[Stewards of Gondor]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Return of the King'', "Minas Tirith", p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Horn of Gondor|horn]] eventually came to [[Boromir]] and was cloven when he fell during the War of the Ring.

The [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] of [[Mirkwood]] allude to the Kine of Araw: they sing of a land "''[w]here the kine and the oxen feed''" while sending wine-barrels off down the [[List of Middle-earth rivers#F|Forest River]] for re-filling in the river's ultimate destination in [[Dorwinion]], a wine-growing region on the shores of the Sea of Rhûn.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien (1937), ''[[The Hobbit]]'', 4th edition (1978), George Allen &amp; Unwin, ch. IX p. 158; {{ISBN|0-04-823147-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kine of Araw have been compared to [[aurochs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenbooks.theonering.net/guest/files/012005.html The Science of Middle-earth: The Kine of Araw]; [[Henry Gee]], ''The Science of Middle-earth''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mearas====
The ''mearas'' (singular ''mearh'') were a breed of wild horses in the north of Middle-earth. Their lifespan is similar to that of Men and their intelligence and strength are extraordinary.  They surpass normal horses in the same manner that Elves surpass Men.

They descend from [[#Felaróf|Felaróf]], who was tamed by [[Eorl the Young]] (later the first [[King of Rohan]]), and perhaps ultimately from [[#Nahar|Nahar]], horse of the Vala [[Oromë]]. Ever since, they have been the mounts of the King and Princes of Rohan alone. During the War of the Ring, however, [[Gandalf|Gandalf the White]]'s friendship with [[#Shadowfax|Shadowfax]], lord of the Mearas, led to Shadowfax allowing Gandalf to ride him into the very end of the [[Third Age]].  King Théoden's mount, Snowmane, was also one of the Mearas.

====Mûmakil====
''Mûmakil'' (singular: ''mûmak'') were animals from [[Harad]] resembling [[elephant]]s. The terms ''mûmak'' and ''mûmakil'' were used by the Men of [[Gondor]]. [[Hobbit]] folklore called these creatures '''''Oliphaunts'''''.

The creatures are described in ''[[The Two Towers]]''. [[Samwise Gamgee]] expresses a desire to see one and tells of Hobbit-lore of their being "big as a house" (see below). Later, Sam then sees one as big as a "moving hill", though the narration implies Sam's "fear and wonder" may have exaggerated its size. Employed as a beast of burden by the [[Haradrim]], the ''mûmakil'' were also used in battle during the wars of the [[Third Age]]. In the [[War of the Ring]], they were used by troops in [[Ithilien]] and in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], much like [[war elephant]]s of the real world. In battle, they carried tower-like structures (corresponding to [[howdah]]s), bearing Haradrim archers. The only known way to kill one was to shoot it in the eye. As with real elephants, horses (other than the Haradrim's own) refused to go near them, making them effective against enemy cavalry. There are also Mûmakil in [[Rhûn]].

"Oliphaunt" is also the title of a short comic poem about the beast quoted by the hobbit [[Samwise Gamgee]], based on traditional bestiary lore from [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]]. The poem appears in ''The Two Towers'' and ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.

The word ''oliphaunt'' is a variant spelling of the archaic word ''[[Olifant (instrument)|oliphant]]'', used in literature to denote "elephant", "ivory", "elephant-tusk", "musical horn made of an elephant tusk", or "a musical instrument resembling such a horn". The most famous use of the term in literature outside Tolkien is in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'', wherein the knight [[Roland]] fails to call for help at the [[Battle of Roncevaux]] using his [[Olifant (instrument)|oliphant]] [[Blowing horn|horn]] until it is too late for him and his comrades. Roland's horn is echoed in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[Boromir]]'s horn and counterposed by [[Helm Hammerhand|Helm's]] horn and the horns of [[Buckland (Middle-earth)|Buckland]].

In the film version of ''The Two Towers'' and ''The Return of the King'', the mûmak is shown as a massive, building-sized elephant with two tusks on the upper jaw and two on the lower jaw (much like the extinct [[Gomphothere]]), whereof the legs are longer and the head smaller in proportion to the body, than those of extant elephants, somewhat more like the long-legged, smaller-headed [[Columbian mammoth]]; and the mûmak's back is humped, akin to the [[Asian elephant]]. In the director's commentary, Peter Jackson joked he was told to make the animals as vicious as possible, otherwise audiences might relate scenes of cavalry attacking the animals to those of trained animal abuse in circuses.

====Wargs====
{{Main|Warg}}
A species of wolves often allied with [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]]. Tolkien took the name from the Old Norse word ''vargr'' (for "wolf").  Sometimes called 'Hound of Sauron', they appear in ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'', ''The Hobbit'', and ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. The two later Peter Jackson film adaptations from ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy had more [[hyena]]-like depictions of them, some even resembling the extinct, heavier-bodied Cenozoic ''[[Hyaenodon]]'' in appearance.&lt;ref&gt;''The "Two Towers" Creatures Guide'' Collins (November 6, 2002) {{ISBN|0-00-714409-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jackson's ''The Hobbit'' trilogy, however, depicts them as more wolf-like and gives them more prominence in the story.

===Other fictional species===

====Dragons====
{{Main|Dragon (Middle-earth)}}
Some of the dragons of Middle-earth could fly, others had no wings. All were inherently evil.

====Dumbledors and Hummerhorns====
Dumbledors and Hummerhorns are creatures fought by the hero of the poem ''[[Errantry]]''. A ''dumbledor'' is an English dialect word for [[bumblebee]], while "''Hummerhorn'' seems to be a Tolkien invention" for a large "[[wasp]] or [[hornet]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Christina Scull]] &amp; [[Wayne G. Hammond]] (2014), editors, ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', Harper Collins, p. 166; {{ISBN|978-0-00-755727-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fell beasts====
{{Main|Nazgûl#Steeds}}
Flying creatures that were used by the [[Nazgûl]] as steeds during the later parts of the [[War of the Ring]]. Tolkien did not use this phrase as a proper name for them (it is simply a description; ''fell'' means "fierce, awful, terrible"), but absent any other name, they are usually called "fell beasts". Tolkien describes one thus:

:''...if bird, then greater than all other birds... ...neither quill nor feather did it bear, and its vast pinions were as webs of hide between horned fingers... A creature of an older world maybe it was...''&lt;ref name="rotk"&gt;{{ME-ref|rotk|"The Battle of the Pelennor Fields"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few paragraphs later it is said to attack with "beak and claw".&lt;ref name="rotk" /&gt; In one of Tolkein's personal letters, he does not confirm, but acknowledges, the common comparison to a [[pterosaur]].

====Great Spiders====
''[[The Hobbit]]'' describes a colony of sapient and oversized [[spider]]s in the northern parts of [[Mirkwood]] at the end of the [[Third Age]]. The Elves of [[Thranduil]]'s realm tried unsuccessfully to exterminate them. During the events of the book, [[Thorin II Oakenshield|Thorin]]'s [[List of The Hobbit characters#Thorin's company|company of Dwarves]] was captured by spiders and enmeshed in webs; however, [[Bilbo Baggins]] managed to free them with the aid of his sword [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]] and his [[One Ring|magic ring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Hobbit|Ch. 8 "Flies and Spiders"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' adds that these spiders were of the brood of [[Shelob]], who in turn was a child of [[Ungoliant]], and that they inhabited southern regions of Mirkwood as well.&lt;ref name="Shelob"&gt;{{ME-ref|TT|"Shelob's Lair"}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also suggests that the spiders appeared after the Shadow fell on Mirkwood around {{ME-date|TA|1050}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|RK|Appendix B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neekerbreekers====
The Neekerbreekers are described as "evil relatives of the [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]]." They lived in the Midgewater Marshes, east of [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]] in central [[Eriador]]. They were given the [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] nickname ''Neekerbreekers'' by [[Sam Gamgee]], referring to their incessant chirping at night.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien (1954), ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', 2nd edition (1966), George Allen &amp; Unwin, book 1 ch. XI p. 195; {{ISBN|0 04 823045 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Were-worms====
{{Main|Wereworms}}

''The Hobbit'' refers to "wild Were-worms in the Last Desert" in "[[Rhûn|the East of East]]".&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien (1937), ''[[The Hobbit]]'', 4th edition (1978), ch. 1 p. 25; {{ISBN|0-04-823147-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual birds==

===Carc===
An intelligent [[#Ravens of Erebor|raven]] that lived upon [[Ravenhill (Middle-earth)|Ravenhill]] beneath the [[Lonely Mountain]] in the days of King [[Thrór]]. He and his mate nested above the guard-chamber there. Carc fathered [[Roäc]], who featured in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', in {{Me-date|TA|2788}}.

===Fisher Blue===
Fisher Blue is one of the birds who roam the [[Withywindle]] river and who are familiar to [[Tom Bombadil]]. Fisher Blue talks with Bombadil (or at least Bombadil understand the bird's language) and teases him, but later assists him. Fisher Blue features in the second poem in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''. He also contributes the blue [[A feather in your cap|hat-feather]] that Bombadil wears in ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien in one of his letters confirms that the species is a [[Common kingfisher]].&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien (1981), ''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', George Allen &amp; Unwin, letter no. 240 (1st August 1962) pp. 318-319; {{ISBN|0-04-826005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gwaihir ===
{{Main|Gwaihir}}

One of the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|great eagles]], Gwaihir is perhaps best known for rescuing [[Gandalf]] from the tower of [[Orthanc]], ending Gandalf's captivity by [[Saruman]].  Also, Gwaihir rescued Gandalf after his battle with the [[balrog]] in [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]. He, his brother [[Landroval]], and [[Meneldor]] accompanied Gandalf to rescue Sam and Frodo from [[Mount Doom]] at the end of the [[War of the Ring]].&lt;ref name="MR1"&gt;{{ME-ref|MR|"Myths Transformed" VIII, pp. 410-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Morgoth's Ring'', p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Little Bird===
Little Bird is one of the creatures who roam the [[Withywindle]] river and who are familiar to [[Tom Bombadil]]. She is a [[willow warbler]] (Tolkien uses the old name ''willow-wren''), and brings news to Bombadil; thus her name is an allusion to the idiom "[[wikt:a little bird told me|a little bird told me]]". She features in the second poem in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.

===Old Swan===
Old Swan is one of the birds who roam the [[Withywindle]] river and who are familiar to [[Tom Bombadil]]. Old Swan is a cob (male) of the [[Mute swan|mute swan species]] ("dumb-throat"), and lives on Elvet-isle, an eyot in the river. It was from Old Swan that Bombadil obtained his original [[A feather in your cap|hat-feather]]. At one point Bombadil casually threatens Old Swan with [[Swan Upping|upping]] by the [[Kings of Arnor]]. Old Swan features in the second poem in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.

===Roäc===
The son of [[#Carc|Carc]] the [[#Ravens of Erebor|Raven]], born in {{ME-date|TA|2788}}. By the time of [[the Quest of Erebor]] organised by [[Thorin II Oakenshield]], Roäc had become the leader of the great ravens of the Lonely Mountain, although it is stated that "he was getting blind, he could hardly fly, and the top of his head was bald." With his and his flock's help, Thorin's company gathered news and communicated with [[Dáin II Ironfoot]] before the [[Battle of Five Armies]].

===Thorondor===
The Lord of [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Eagles]] in the [[First Age]], said in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' to be the "mightiest of all birds that have ever been", with a wingspan of thirty [[fathom]]s (54.9 meters, or 180 feet) and a beak of [[gold]].&lt;ref name="Silm-RN"&gt;{{Harvnb|''The Silmarillion''|loc="Of the Return of the Noldor", p. 110|Ref=Silmarillion 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|''The Lost Road''|loc="Quenta Silmarillion", §97|Ref=Lost Road 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name translates from [[Sindarin]], an Elven tongue devised by Tolkien, as 'King of Eagles';&lt;ref name="Etym_THORON-, TĀ-"&gt;{{Harvnb|''The Etymologies''|loc=entries THORON-, TĀ-|Ref=Lost Road 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; its cognate form in [[Quenya]], another Elven language, is '''Sorontar'''.&lt;ref name="Etym_THORON-, TĀ-"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR409-11"&gt;{{Harvnb|''Morgoth's Ring''|loc="Myths Transformed", VIII, pp. 409–411|Ref=Morgoth's Ring 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led the eagles during most of their appearances in ''The Silmarillion'', and has a significant role of his own.

Thorondor first enters the narrative when he helped the Elven-prince [[Fingon]] rescue his kinsman [[Maedhros]] from imprisonment upon [[Thangorodrim]].&lt;ref name="Silm-RN"/&gt; After the [[Dagor Bragollach]], he saved [[Fingolfin]]'s body from defilement by his slayer [[Morgoth]], giving the Dark Lord a scar on his face and carrying the Elven-king's corpse to the [[Encircling Mountains]] north of [[Gondolin]], where it was buried by [[Turgon]].&lt;ref name="Silm-RB"&gt;{{Harvnb|''The Silmarillion''|loc="Of the Ruin of Beleriand", pp. 154, 158–9|Ref=Silmarillion 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Thorondor espied [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]] at the feet of the Mountains, and sent two of his servants to fetch them and bear to Gondolin, fulfilling thus the intentions of the Vala [[Ulmo]].&lt;ref name="Silm-RB"/&gt; Thorondor and two other eagles rescued [[Lúthien]] and the wounded [[Beren]] from the doors of [[Angband (Middle-earth)|Angband]] during their [[Quest of the Silmaril]], taking them to [[Doriath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|''The Silmarillion''|loc="Of Beren and Lúthien", p. 182|Ref=Silmarillion 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual horses==

===Individual [[First Age]] horses===

====Arroch====
The horse that [[Húrin]] Lord of [[Dor-lómin]] rode to the battle of [[Nírnaeth Arnoediad]]. Neither horse nor rider returned, and [[Morwen]] Húrin's wife "listened for his footfall in the sleepless watches of the night, or would wake thinking that she had heard in the courtyard the neigh of Arroch his horse".

====Nahar====
Nahar (from the [[Valarin]] '''Næχærra''') was the horse of the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Vala]] [[Oromë]]. It was the neighing of Nahar that alerted Oromë to the presence of the [[Quendi]] when he came upon them for the first time, and light from the sparks his hooves threw up were the first light in [[Valinor]] after the darkening of the trees.

====Rochallor====
The horse of [[Fingolfin]], High King of the [[Noldor]]. Rochallor bore the King to the gates of [[Angband]], where a desperate and fearless Fingolfin challenged [[Morgoth]] to single combat.  Rochallor stayed by his master throughout the duel, but was driven away by wolves.  He died of a burst heart in [[Hithlum]] soon afterwards.

===Rohan and Éothéod's individual horses===

====Arod====
The grey [[horse]] given to [[Legolas]] by the [[Riders of Rohan]] in ''The Two Towers''. [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] also rides him, sitting behind Legolas, until they reach [[Minas Tirith]]. The epilogue to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (published in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', volume IX, ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'') has Sam saying that "Legolas let his horse run back free to Rohan from [[Isengard]]", presumably after the war, when Legolas and Gimli left the rest of the Company to visit [[Helm's Deep#Aglarond|Aglarond]] and [[Fangorn]]. The name Arod means 'swift' and 'noble.' In "The Lord of the Rings" by "J.R.R. Tolkien" Legolas refers to Arod as 'brave' and 'a defender of the Elves' when the horse so willingly carried Legolas and Gimli through all their perils on their quest.

====Brego====
Brego is a horse of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] ridden by [[Aragorn]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s film adaptations of [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|''The Two Towers'']] and [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|''The Return of the King'']]. He was originally [[Théodred|Théodred's]] horse. Aragorn first meets him in the stables at [[Edoras]], where two of the Rohirrim are struggling to bring him under control, and Aragorn calms him by speaking Elvish to him, and then tells [[Éowyn]] to set him free. After Aragorn’s fall in the skirmish with the Warg riders, Brego carries him to [[Helm's Deep]]. Aragorn continues to ride Brego until their arrival at the door to the [[Paths of the Dead]], at which point Brego and Arod bolt.

In Tolkien’s writings, the name [[Brego]] refers only to the second King of Rohan.  This is noted in the film version of ''The Two Towers'' when Aragorn, speaking in Elvish to Brego at Edoras, tells him, "Your name is kingly".

====Felaróf====
The first of the [[#Mearas|Mearas]], a white [[stallion]], described as being as intelligent and long-lived as any human, and capable of understanding the speech of Men.

Felaróf began life as a [[wild horse]] in [[Éothéod]], a land near the sources of the [[Anduin]] in northern [[Wilderland]]. He was captured as a foal by [[Léod]], lord of Éothéod and a tamer of horses. Felaróf grew in captivity but no one could tame him. In {{ME-date|TA|2504}} Léod attempted to mount him, but was killed when the horse threw him.

Léod's son [[Eorl the Young]] (then aged 16) vowed to avenge his father, commanding the horse to serve him as [[weregild]] for his father. Eorl named the horse ''[[wikt:fela|Fela]][[wikt:rof|róf]]'' (meaning "very valiant, very strong" in the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] poetic vocabulary)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', "Cirion and Eorl", p. 314, note 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and rode him without bit or bridle. They took part in the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]]. Felaróf was buried in Eorl's burial mound.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lord of the Rings'', Appendix A, II, timeline, p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Firefoot====
The horse of [[Éomer]] of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]]; he bore Éomer and [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] from Edoras to [[Helm's Deep]] before the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].

====Hasufel====
The horse given to [[Aragorn]] by the Riders of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] in ''The Two Towers''. Previously, this horse had been ridden by a Rider named Garulf, killed in the recent skirmish with the band of orcs that had captured Merry and Pippin ("May he bear you well and to better fortune than Garulf, his late master!" — Éomer to Aragorn). Aragorn later rode his own horse, [[#Roheryn|Roheryn]], who came to Rohan with a company of [[Dúnedain]] from the north.

The name ''Hasufel'' derives from the [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:hasu|hasu]]'' 'grey, dusky' and ''[[wikt:fell#Old English|fel]]'' 'coat, pelt'.

====Lightfoot====
A horse of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], and the sire of [[#Snowmane|Snowmane]]. Lightfoot is mentioned on the inscription on Snowmane's grave (Snowmane's Howe).

====Shadowfax====
A horse of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], and the chief of the ''[[#Mearas|Mearas]]''. Possessing fantastic speed and stamina, he features in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as the steed of [[Gandalf]] the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizard]]. Like the other ''mearas'', Shadowfax was a '[[gray (horse)|grey]]' or silver stallion and could understand the speech of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]. His name is "an anglicized form of ... [[Old English|OE]] ''[[wikt:sceadu|Sceadu]]-[[wikt:feax|fæx]]''",&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien (1967), ''[[Translations of The Lord of the Rings#Tolkien's Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings]]'', published in [[Wayne G. Hammond]] &amp; [[Christina Scull]] (2005), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'',  p. 762/763; {{ISBN|0 00 720308 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning ''Shadow-mane''; the same element ([[Old Norse]] ''fax'' meaning "mane") appears in the names of the horses [[Skinfaxi and Hrímfaxi]] in [[Norse Mythology]].

Shadowfax had been foaled in the [[Rohan (Middle-earth)#Regions|Westfold]] dales of Rohan.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien (1954), ''[[The Two Towers]]'', 2nd edition (1966), George Allen &amp; Unwin, book 3 ch. XI pp. 205-206; {{ISBN|0 04 823046 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rohan's [[King Théoden]] effectively gave the horse to Gandalf on 20th 'September' {{ME-date|TA|3018}}. As Gandalf's steed he faced the [[Witch-king]], participated in the [[Battle of the Morannon]], and visited [[Tom Bombadil]].

No one except [[Gandalf]] could ride Shadowfax. At Gandalf's request, Shadowfax also carried [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] for a time, and later [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], a [[Hobbit]].

In an unpublished epilogue&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|SD|p. 123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a letter&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Letters|Letter #268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien stated that Shadowfax [[Valinor|passed West]] over the [[Belegaer|Sea]] with Gandalf; in ''The Lord of the Rings'' Gandalf appears with a "great grey horse" on the quay just before departing, and he had earlier promised Shadowfax (in the chapter "The White Rider") that they would not be parted again in this world.

In the film adaptations of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', directed by [[Peter Jackson]], Shadowfax was primarily played by a white horse named Blanco, owned by Cynthia Royal. Blanco was euthanized after illness in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Deen |first= Sarah |title= 'The lord of all horses': Much-loved ''Lord of the Rings'' horse Shadowfax dies |location= United Kingdom |publisher= Metro News |date= 11 Apr 2014 |url= http://metro.co.uk/2014/04/11/the-lord-of-all-horses-much-loved-lord-of-the-rings-horse-shadowfax-dies-4695764/ |quote= First seen in ''The Two Towers'', Blanco's most memorable moment as Shadowfax came when Gandalf and Pippin rode to Edoras in ''Return of the King'', with Gandalf uttering one of the most-quotable lines: 'Run, Shadowfax, show us the meaning of haste.' |accessdate= May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2014/04/06/88420-in-memory-of-shadowfax/ |author= Kelvarhin |date= |title= In Memory of Shadowfax |publisher= The One Ring |accessdate= May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another horse, an [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian stallion]] named Domero, played Shadowfax until its death in 2003.{{citation needed|date= May 2017}} In Jackson's film of ''The Return of the King'', Shadowfax kicks [[Denethor]] onto the pyre in [[Middle-earth roads#Rath Dínen|Minas Tirith's necropolis]], which saves [[Faramir]]. However, in [[The Return of the King|the book]], Shadowfax does not participate in the pyre scene at all, having been left at the gate of the necropolis.

====Snowmane====
The horse of King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], who accompanied Théoden to the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], and was ridden on the final charge out of the fortress. At the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Snowmane was pierced by a black dart, causing him to fall onto Théoden. He was buried with honour on the field of battle; his grave, known as Snowmane's Howe, bore the inscription:

:''Faithful servant yet master's bane''
:''Lightfoot's foal, swift Snowmane. ''
:— ''[[The Return of the King]]'', "The Battle of the Pelennor Fields", p. 120

====Windfola====
[[Éowyn]]'s grey horse. Disguised as Dernhelm, Éowyn rode with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] on Windfola to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. During the battle, Windfola was terrified by the [[Nazgûl]]'s fell beast; Éowyn and Merry were thrown from Windfola's back, and Windfola ran wild over the plain.

===Other individual horses===

====Asfaloth====
The horse ridden by [[Glorfindel]] when he meets [[Aragorn|Strider]] and the Hobbits before they arrive at [[Rivendell]]. Asfaloth (meaning "Foam Flower" in [[Sindarin]]) carries [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] alone to the [[Ford of Bruinen]]. &lt;blockquote&gt;'Ride on! Ride on!' cried Glorfindel, and then loud and clear he called to the horse in the elf-tongue: ''noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!''" ([[Sindarin]] for 'run quickly'). &lt;br /&gt;--''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "Flight to the Ford"&lt;/blockquote&gt; In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|film version of ''The Fellowship of the Ring'']], Asfaloth is Arwen's horse and the two flee with the wounded Frodo across the ford from the [[Black Riders]].

====Roheryn====
The name ''Roheryn'' means 'horse of the lady' in Tolkien's invented Elven language, Sindarin; this stems from the gift of the horse to [[Aragorn]] by [[Arwen]]. Roheryn was brought to Aragorn in the South by his kinsman [[Halbarad]] during the War of the Ring, prior to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. He, Arod, and the other horses of the Dúnedain went with their masters on the Paths of the Dead and made the great march to Pelargir.

==Individual ponies==

=== Bill ===
A pony bought in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]] for the exorbitant price of twelve [[silver penny|silver pennies]] by [[Barliman Butterbur]] for [[Frodo Baggins]] and his companions, to replace [[#Bumpkin|the ponies]] stolen from them. Butterbur purchased Bill from Bill Ferny, a neighbor in league with the spies who stole the other ponies. In the hobbits' service Bill became a fatter and happier pony. He was named 'Bill' by [[Sam Gamgee]] shortly after the party left Bree.

Bill became acquainted with elvish horses in [[Rivendell]], to his advantage. He accompanied the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]] (indeed he is described as a "member" of the group&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien (1954), ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', 2nd edition (1966), George Allen &amp; Unwin, book 2 ch. 3 p. 293; {{ISBN|0 04 823045 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from Rivendell to the [[Moria (Middle-earth)#West-gate|doors of Moria]], but had to be left behind there. An attack by the [[Watcher in the Water]] left the Company thinking him slain; but he returned to Bree, where he was nursed back to health and reunited with Sam on the return journey to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]]. Bill's old master, Bill Ferny, had been set by [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] to watch the gate at the [[Baranduin|Brandywine]] bridge into the Shire; and after he was cowed into submission by the hobbits, Bill the pony gave him a kick. Sam later took the pony to [[Hobbiton]].

=== Bumpkin ===
One of five ponies obtained by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and used by the hobbits to ride from [[Shire (Middle-earth)#Buckland|Crickhollow]] (on the eastern borders of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]]) to [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]. One of the ponies bore [[Frodo Baggins]], and therefore the [[One Ring]]. Their journey passed through the [[Old Forest]] and stayed at the house of [[Tom Bombadil]], where the ponies got to know Bombadil's pony, [[#Fatty Lumpkin|Fatty Lumpkin]].

The hobbits became separated from the five ponies during an encounter with a [[barrow-wight]]. The hobbits were rescued by Bombadil, who also reunited them with the ponies. Bombadil gave the five ponies their names at this time: "''Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail, and Bumpkin, White-socks my little lad''"; from then on they answered only to those names.

The five ponies later vanish, during the attack on Bree by the [[Black Riders]]. The reader is told that the ponies find their way to Bombadil and Fatty Lumpkin, and are eventually sent back to Bree, to be looked after by [[Barliman Butterbur]].

=== Fatty Lumpkin ===
The pony kept by [[Tom Bombadil]]. Fatty Lumpkin (sometimes just "Lumpkin") was rarely ridden by Tom, and spent much of his time roaming free on the [[Barrow-downs]]. The ponies of Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin got to know Fatty Lumpkin and managed to find him after the hobbits encountered a wight in the Barrow-downs. When the hobbits' ponies escaped from Bree, their familiarity with Fatty Lumpkin led them back to Tom's house.

=== Sharp-ears ===
''See'' [[List of Middle-earth animals#Bumpkin|Bumpkin]].

=== Strider ===
The pony ridden by [[Frodo Baggins]] from [[Minas Tirith]] back to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], and from the Shire to the [[Grey Havens]]. The pony came to be known as Strider during or after the journey from Minas Tirith.&lt;ref&gt;''The Return of the King'', "The Grey Havens", p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stybba ===
The pony given by King [[Théoden]] of Rohan to [[Merry Brandybuck]]. He is described as small, shaggy, and grey. Théoden's reason for leaving Merry in [[Edoras]] while he rides to [[Gondor]] to do battle is that Stybba cannot keep up with the horses of the Rohirrim, and none of the riders can carry Merry. The name is from [[Old English]] ''styb'' "stub, stump". [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''stubbur'' is a common name for sheep.

=== Swish-tail ===
''See'' [[List of Middle-earth animals#Bumpkin|Bumpkin]].

=== White-socks ===
''See'' [[List of Middle-earth animals#Bumpkin|Bumpkin]].

=== Wise-nose ===
''See'' [[List of Middle-earth animals#Bumpkin|Bumpkin]].

==Individual dogs and wolves==
Named dogs also appear in two pieces of Tolkien's fiction that are not part of his legendarium: [[Farmer Giles of Ham#Garm|Garm]], a significant character in ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', and Rover, the titular protagonist of ''[[Roverandom]]''.

===Carcharoth===
{{Main|Carcharoth}}
The "mightiest of all wolves", bred by [[Morgoth]] and set to guard the gates of [[Angband]]. He bit off [[Beren]]'s hand together with the [[Silmaril]] and was maddened by its touch. Carcharoth was slain by [[#Huan|Huan]], but not before he managed to wound mortally both the hound and Beren.

===Draugluin===
A [[Werewolf (Middle-earth)|werewolf]] (the first to exist) in the service of [[Sauron]] in the [[First Age]].

Bred from the wolves and inhabited with an evil spirit sent by [[Morgoth]] himself, Draugluin was the sire of all werewolves of [[Beleriand]], including [[#Carcharoth|Carcharoth]], and lived with his master [[Sauron]] in [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], the former [[Minas Tirith (First Age)|watchtower]] of [[Finrod Felagund]].

Draugluin was slain by the hound [[#Huan|Huan]] during the Quest for the [[Silmaril]], and [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] used his pelt to sneak into [[Angband]].

An earlier form of the name was '''Drauglir'''. While Draugluin translates as "blue wolf" in Sindarin, a closer translation is believed to be "pale wolf."{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Fang, Grip and Wolf===
[[Farmer Maggot]]'s guard dogs.

===Huan===
Huan, also known as the '''Hound of [[Valinor]]''', was a great hound, approximately the same size as a small horse, given to [[Celegorm]], one of the [[Sons of Fëanor]], by the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Vala]] [[Oromë]] the Hunter. When the [[Noldor]] under [[Fëanor]] rebelled, Huan went to [[Middle-earth]] with his master. For this reason, he fell under the [[Doom of Mandos]].

When [[Beren]] had gone with [[Finrod Felagund]] to [[Angband]] but had been captured in [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], [[Lúthien]] set out to rescue him. She was intercepted by Celegorm and [[Curufin]]; whereas Huan captured her, and she was brought before Celegorm. Celegorm and Curufin took her as a prisoner to [[Nargothrond]], secretly plotting to wed her to Celegorm and thereby force an alliance with Lúthien's father [[Thingol]]. Huan felt pity for Lúthien, and therefore told her of a way to escape, and accompanied her to Tol-in-Gaurhoth to rescue Beren, where he killed all of Sauron's [[Werewolf (Middle-earth)|werewolves]], as well as Sauron himself in wolf form. Thereafter Huan returned to Celegorm, who had been exiled from Nargothrond by [[Orodreth]].

On their way to [[Himring]], Celegorm, Curufin, and Huan came across [[Beren and Lúthien]] in the north of [[Doriath]]. Curufin tried to kill Lúthien, but Huan drove Celegorm and Curufin away, and told Beren and Lúthien of his plan to gain entrance to Angband, disguised as the werewolf [[#Draugluin|Draugluin]] and the vampire [[Thuringwethil]]. After Beren and Lúthien had won the Silmaril but Beren had lost his hand to the wolf [[Carcharoth]], Huan joined Beren, Thingol, [[Beleg|Beleg Cúthalion]], and [[Mablung]] to capture the former. Huan and Beren killed Carcharoth; but Huan was mortally wounded, wished Beren farewell, and died.

Tolkien wrote he was either a beast-shaped [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]] or a common animal taught to speak by the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]].&lt;ref name="MR1"/&gt;

==Other individual mammals==
===Badger-brock===
[[European badger|Badger]]-brock is one of the animals who live in or near the [[Withywindle]] river and who are familiar to [[Tom Bombadil]]. He lives in his [[sett]] with his sow and cubs. Bombadil stumbles into the sett, but convinces Badger-brock to let him leave unmolested. Badger-brock features in the eponymous first poem of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.

===Queen Berúthiel's cats===
{{Main|Queen Berúthiel}}
The cats used as spies by the [[Black Númenórean]] Berúthiel, a queen-consort of [[Gondor]].

===Boar of Everholt===
The great [[boar]] that roamed [[Minor places in Middle-earth (fictional)#Everholt|Everholt]], a section of Firien Wood on the eastern border of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]]. In {{ME-date|TA|2864}} King [[Folca]] of Rohan hunted this beast down and slew it, but he "died of the tusk-wounds that it gave him."

===Tevildo===
A monstrous cat in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. Tolkien developed the character into [[Sauron#Concept and creation|Sauron]].

===Whisker-lad===
Whisker-lad is an [[Eurasian otter|otter]], one of the animals who roam the [[Withywindle]] river. [[Tom Bombadil]] is familiar with Whisker-lad and his family. Bombadil and Whisker-lad engage in repartee; one of Bombadil's retorts is a reference to the Norse lay of [[Ótr]], when Bombadil threatens to give the hide of the disrespectful otter to the [[Barrow-wights]], who he says will cover it with gold apart from a single whisker. Whisker-lad features in the second poem in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.

==Other individual animals==

===Fastitocalon===
{{Main|Fastitocalon (poem)}}
Fastitocalon, an enormous [[sea turtle]], is the subject of a poem of the same name in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.

===Shelob===
{{Main|Shelob}}
An "evil thing in [[spider]] form"&lt;ref name="Shelob"/&gt; that dwelt beneath the Pass of [[Cirith Ungol]] on the borders of [[Mordor]]. During the events of ''The Lord of the Rings'', she attacked the Ring-bearer [[Frodo Baggins]], who passed through her lair, but was finally repelled by [[Sam Gamgee]].  She is called the "last child of [[Ungoliant]] to trouble the unhappy world".&lt;ref name="Shelob"/&gt;

=== Ungoliant ===
{{Main|Ungoliant}}
Described as an evil spirit in the form of a spider. She is mentioned briefly in ''The Lord of the Rings'', and plays a supporting role in ''The Silmarillion''. She is said to have given birth to Shelob.  Her origins are unclear, as Tolkien's writings don't explicitly reveal her nature, other than that she is from "before the world".

=== Watcher in the Water ===
{{Main|Watcher in the Water}}
A mysterious creature with tentacles appearing in ''The Lord of the Rings''. At the end of the Third Age, it lived in a lake before the [[Moria (Middle-earth)#West-door|West-gate]] of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], and attacked the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Company of the Ring]] during the events of the book. In Peter Jackson's film adaptation the Watcher somewhat resembles a [[cephalopod]] with an eversible, many-toothed mouth.

==Biodiversity==
This section provides a list of the diverse range of real animals that are mentioned or alluded to in Tolkien's fiction. The species and types are animals familiar to Tolkien from the ecology of England and the mythologies of northern Europe. The inclusion of these animals in his [[legendarium]] reinforces the notion that [[Middle-earth]] is set in the Earth's [[Old World]] (albeit in a fictional prehistoric era).

Red dots are current sites, while green dots are sites that have been cleaned up and removed from the NPL.]]
This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Alaska''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   

These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of March 26, 2010, there were six Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No additional sites are currently proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  Three sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

 |quote = '''Macromolecule'''&lt;br/&gt;'''Large molecule'''

A molecule of high relative molecular mass, the structure of which essentially&lt;br/&gt;comprises the multiple repetition of units derived, actually or conceptually, from&lt;br/&gt;molecules of low relative molecular mass.

;Notes

1. In many cases, especially for synthetic polymers, a molecule can be regarded&lt;br/&gt;as having a high relative molecular mass if the addition or removal of one or a&lt;br/&gt;few of the units has a negligible effect on the molecular properties. This statement&lt;br/&gt;fails in the case of certain macromolecules for which the properties may be&lt;br/&gt;critically dependent on fine details of the molecular structure.&lt;br/&gt;
2. If a part or the whole of the molecule fits into this definition, it may be described&lt;br/&gt;as either ''macromolecular'' or ''polymeric'', or by ''polymer'' used adjectivally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Glossary of basic terms in polymer science (IUPAC Recommendations 1996)|journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|date=1996|volume=68|issue=12|pages=2287–2311|doi=10.1351/pac199668122287|url=http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/1996/pdf/6812x2287.pdf|last1=Jenkins|first1=A. D|last2=Kratochvíl|first2=P|last3=Stepto|first3=R. F. T|last4=Suter|first4=U. W}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
}}
The term ''macromolecule'' (''[[wikt:macro-#Prefix|macro-]]'' + ''molecule'') was coined by [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Hermann Staudinger]] in the 1920s, although his first relevant publication on this field only mentions ''high molecular compounds'' (in excess of 1,000 atoms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Staudinger, H. |author2=Fritschi, J. |title=Über Isopren und Kautschuk. 5. Mitteilung. Über die Hydrierung des Kautschuks und über seine Konstitution|doi=10.1002/hlca.19220050517|date=1922|journal=Helvetica Chimica Acta|volume=5|issue=5|pages=785}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the phrase ''polymer'', as introduced by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius|Berzelius]] in 1833, had a different meaning from that of today: it simply was another form of [[isomerism]] for example with [[benzene]] and [[acetylene]] and had little to do with size.&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed085p624|title=The Origin of the Polymer Concept|date=2008|last1=Jensen|first1=William B.|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=85|pages=624|issue=5|bibcode = 2008JChEd..85..624J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the term to describe large molecules varies among the disciplines. For example, while [[biology]] refers to macromolecules as the four large molecules comprising living things, in [[chemistry]], the term may refer to aggregates of two or more molecules held together by [[intermolecular force]]s rather than [[covalent bond]]s but which do not readily dissociate.&lt;ref&gt;van Holde, K.E.

According to the standard [[IUPAC]] definition, the term ''macromolecule'' as used in polymer science refers only to a single molecule. For example, a single polymeric molecule is appropriately described as a "macromolecule" or "polymer molecule" rather than a "polymer," which suggests a [[Chemical substance|substance]] composed of macromolecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iupac.org/reports/1996/6812jenkins/6812basicterms.pdf|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=68|page=2287|date=1996|author=Jenkins, A. D.|title=Glossary of Basic Terms in Polymer Science|doi=10.1351/pac199668122287|last2=Kratochvíl|first2=P.|last3=Stepto|first3=R. F. T.|last4=Suter|first4=U. W.|issue=12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223103549/http://www.iupac.org/reports/1996/6812jenkins/6812basicterms.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their size, macromolecules are not conveniently described in terms of [[stoichiometry]] alone. The structure of simple macromolecules, such as homopolymers, may be described in terms of the individual monomer subunit and total [[molecular mass]]. Complicated biomacromolecules, on the other hand, require multi-faceted structural description such as the hierarchy of structures used to describe [[proteins]]. In [[British English]], the word "macromolecule" tends to be called "'''high polymer'''".

==Properties==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
Macromolecules often have unusual physical properties that do not occur for smaller molecules.


Another common macromolecular property that does not characterize smaller molecules is their relative insolubility in water and similar [[solvent]]s, instead forming [[colloids]]. Many require [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] or particular [[ion]]s to dissolve in water. Similarly, many proteins will [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] if the solute concentration of their solution is too high or too low.

High concentrations of macromolecules in a solution can alter the [[reaction rate|rates]] and [[equilibrium constant]]s of the reactions of other macromolecules, through an effect known as [[macromolecular crowding]].&lt;ref name="Minton"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Minton AP |title=How can biochemical reactions within cells differ from those in test tubes? |journal=J. Cell Sci. |volume=119 |issue=Pt 14 |pages=2863–9 |date=2006 |pmid=16825427 |doi=10.1242/jcs.03063}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes from macromolecules [[excluded volume|excluding]] other molecules from a large part of the volume of the solution, thereby increasing the [[activity (chemistry)|effective concentrations]] of these molecules.

== Linear biopolymers ==

All [[Organism|living organisms]] are dependent on three essential [[biopolymers]] for their biological functions: [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and [[proteins]].&lt;ref name="isbn1-4292-2936-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Berg, Jeremy Mark |author2=Tymoczko, John L. |author3=Stryer, Lubert |title = Biochemistry, 7th ed.

Fourth edition is available online through the NCBI Bookshelf: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=mboc4 link]&lt;/ref&gt; The simple summary is that [[Central dogma of molecular biology|DNA makes RNA, and then RNA makes proteins]].

DNA, RNA, and proteins all consist of a repeating structure of related building blocks ([[Nucleotides|nucleotide]]s in the case of DNA and RNA, [[amino acids]] in the case of proteins). In general, they are all unbranched polymers, and so can be represented in the form of a string. Indeed, they can be viewed as a string of beads, with each bead representing a single nucleotide or amino acid monomer linked together through [[Covalent bond|covalent chemical bonds]] into a very long chain.

In most cases, the monomers within the chain have a strong propensity to interact with other amino acids or nucleotides. In DNA and RNA, this can take the form of Watson-Crick [[base pair]]s (G-C and A-T or A-U), although many more complicated interactions can and do occur.

Because of the double-stranded nature of DNA, essentially all of the nucleotides take the form of [[Watson-Crick pairs|Watson-Crick base pair]]s between nucleotides on the two complementary strands of the [[Double-Helix|double-helix]].

In contrast, both RNA and proteins are normally single-stranded. Therefore, they are not constrained by the regular geometry of the DNA double helix, and so fold into complex [[Biomolecular structure|three-dimensional shape]]s dependent on their sequence. These different shapes are responsible for many of the common properties of RNA and proteins, including the formation of specific [[Binding site|binding pockets]], and the ability to catalyse biochemical reactions.

==== DNA is optimised for encoding information ====
[[DNA]] is an information storage macromolecule that encodes the complete set of [[Nucleic acid sequence|instructions]] (the [[genome]]) that are required to assemble, maintain, and reproduce every living organism.&lt;ref name="isbn978-0062730992"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Golnick, Larry |author2=Wheelis, Mark. |title = The Cartoon Guide to Genetics|publisher = Collins Reference|isbn = 978-0-06-273099-2|oclc = |doi = |date=1991-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA and RNA are both capable of encoding genetic information, because there are biochemical mechanisms which read the information coded within a DNA or RNA sequence and use it to generate a specified protein. On the other hand, the sequence information of a protein molecule is not used by cells to functionally encode genetic information.&lt;ref name="Stryer_2002"/&gt;{{Rp|5}}

DNA has three primary attributes that allow it to be far better than RNA at encoding genetic information. First, it is normally double-stranded, so that there are a minimum of two copies of the information encoding each gene in every cell. Second, DNA has a much greater stability against breakdown than does RNA, an attribute primarily associated with the absence of the 2'-hydroxyl group within every nucleotide of DNA. Third, highly sophisticated DNA surveillance and repair systems are present which monitor damage to the DNA and [[DNA repair|repair]] the sequence when necessary. Analogous systems have not evolved for repairing damaged RNA molecules. Consequently, chromosomes can contain many billions of atoms, arranged in a specific chemical structure.

==== Proteins are optimised for catalysis ====

[[Proteins]] are functional macromolecules responsible for [[Enzyme catalysis|catalysing]] the [[Metabolism|biochemical reaction]]s that sustain life.&lt;ref name="Stryer_2002"/&gt;{{Rp|3}} Proteins carry out all functions of an organism, for example photosynthesis, neural function, vision, and movement.&lt;ref name="isbn978-1593272029"&gt;{{cite book |author = Takemura, Masaharu|title = The Manga Guide to Molecular Biology|publisher = [[No Starch Press]]|location = |year = 2009|pages = |isbn = 978-1-59327-202-9|oclc = |doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-stranded nature of protein molecules, together with their composition of 20 or more different amino acid building blocks, allows them to fold in to a vast number of different three-dimensional shapes, while providing binding pockets through which they can specifically interact with all manner of molecules. In addition, the chemical diversity of the different amino acids, together with different chemical environments afforded by local 3D structure, enables many proteins to act as [[enzymes]], catalyzing a wide range of specific biochemical transformations within cells. In addition, proteins have evolved the ability to bind a wide range of [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] and [[coenzymes]], smaller molecules that can endow the protein with specific activities beyond those associated with the polypeptide chain alone.

==== RNA is multifunctional ====
[[RNA]] is multifunctional, its primary function is to [[Protein synthesis|encode proteins]], according to the instructions within a cell’s DNA.&lt;ref name="Stryer_2002"/&gt;{{Rp|5}} They control and regulate many aspects of protein synthesis in [[eukaryote]]s.

RNA encodes genetic information that can be [[Translation (biology)|translated]] into the amino acid sequence of proteins, as evidenced by the messenger RNA molecules present within every cell, and the RNA genomes of a large number of viruses. The single-stranded nature of RNA, together with tendency for rapid breakdown and a lack of repair systems means that RNA is not so well suited for the long-term storage of genetic information as is DNA.

In addition, RNA is a single-stranded polymer that can, like proteins, fold into a very large number of three-dimensional structures. Some of these structures provide binding sites for other molecules and chemically-active centers that can catalyze specific chemical reactions on those bound molecules. The limited number of different building blocks of RNA (4 nucleotides vs &gt;20 amino acids in proteins), together with their lack of chemical diversity, results in catalytic RNA ([[ribozymes]]) being generally less-effective catalysts than proteins for most biological reactions.

== Branched biopolymers ==
[[File:Raspberry ellagitannin.png|thumb|250px|right|[[Raspberry ellagitannin]], a [[tannin]] composed of core of glucose units surrounded by gallic acid esters and ellagic acid units]]
[[Carbohydrates|Carbohydrate]] macromolecules ([[polysaccharide]]s) are formed from polymers of [[monosaccharides]].&lt;ref name="Stryer_2002"/&gt;{{Rp|11}} Because monosaccharides have multiple [[functional groups]], polysaccharides can form linear polymers (e.g. [[cellulose]]) or complex branched structures (e.g. [[glycogen]]). Polysaccharides perform numerous roles in living organisms, acting as energy stores (e.g. [[starch]]) and as structural components (e.g. [[chitin]] in arthropods and fungi). Many carbohydrates contain modified monosaccharide units that have had functional groups replaced or removed.

[[Polyphenol]]s consist of a branched structure of multiple [[Phenols#Naturally occurring|phenolic]] subunits. They can perform structural roles (e.g. [[lignin]]) as well as roles as [[secondary metabolites]] involved in [[Cell signaling|signalling]], [[plant pigment|pigmentation]] and [[plant toxin|defense]].

== Synthetic macromolecules ==
[[Image:Dendrimer ChemEurJ 2002 3858.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Structure of a polyphenylene [[dendrimer]] macromolecule reported by Müllen, et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Roland E.

Polymers may be prepared from inorganic matter as well as for instance in [[inorganic polymer]]s and [[geopolymer]]s. The incorporation of inorganic elements enables the tunability of properties and/or responsive behavior as for instance in [[smart inorganic polymers]].

A '''meteotsunami''' or '''meteorological tsunami'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ioc3.unesco.org/itic/files/tsunami_glossary_small.pdf Tsunami Glossary 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716100504/http://ioc3.unesco.org/itic/files/tsunami_glossary_small.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }}, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[tsunami]]-like [[wave]] of [[meteorological]] origin. Meteotsunamis are generated when rapid changes in [[barometric pressure]] cause the displacement of a body of water. In contrast to "ordinary" impulse-type tsunami sources, a traveling atmospheric disturbance normally interacts with the ocean over a limited period of time (from several minutes to several hours).&lt;ref name="Monserrat"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monserrat|first=S. |author2=Vilibić I. |author3=Rabinovich A.B|year=2006|title=Meteotsunamis: atmospherically induced destructive ocean waves in the tsunami frequency band|journal=Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences|volume=6|pages=1035–1051|url=http://hal-sde.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/29/93/94/PDF/nhess-6-1035-2006.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2011|doi=10.5194/nhess-6-1035-2006|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsunamis and meteotsunamis are otherwise similar enough that it can be difficult to distinguish one from the other, as in cases where there is a tsunami wave but there are no seismic records of an earthquake.&lt;ref name="Monserrat"/&gt;{{rp|1036}}

Only about 3% of historical tsunami events (from 2000 BC through 2014) are known to have meteorological origins, although their true prevalence may be considerably higher than this because 10% of historical tsunamis have unknown origins, tsunami events in the past are often difficult to validate, and meteotsunamis may have previously been misclassified as [[seiche]] waves.&lt;ref name="NOAA Examination"/&gt;

Meteotsunamis are restricted to local effects because they lack the energy available to significant seismic tsunami. However, when they are amplified by resonance they can be hazardous.&lt;ref name="Monserrat"/&gt; A meteotsunami that struck Nagasaki Bay on 31 March 1979 achieved a maximum wave height of 5 meters; there were three fatalities.&lt;ref name="NOAA Examination"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Kathleen|last2=DiVeglio|first2=Christopher|last3=Welty|first3=Ashley|title=An Examination of the June 2013 East Coast Meteotsunami Captured By NOAA Observing Systems (NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 079)|url=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/publications/NOS_COOPS_079.pdf|website=NOAA.Gov|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-meter wave that hit the Chicago waterfront in 1954 swept people off of piers, drowning seven.&lt;ref name="NOAA Examination"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

In some parts of the world, they are common enough to have local names: ''rissaga'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''ressaca''{{cn|date=November 2016}} ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), ''milgħuba'' ([[Maltese language|Maltese]]), ''marrobbio'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''abiki'' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]), ''šćiga'' ([[Croatian language|Croatian]]).&lt;ref name="Monserrat"/&gt; Some bodies of water are more susceptible than others, including anywhere that the natural resonance frequency matches that of the waves, such as in long and narrow bays, particularly where the inlet is aligned with the oncoming wave.&lt;ref name="NOAA Examination"/&gt;{{rp|4}} Examples of particularly susceptible areas include Nagasaki Bay,&lt;ref name="Monserrat"/&gt;{{rp|1038–1040}}&lt;ref name="NOAA Examination"/&gt;{{rp|8}} the eastern [[Adriatic Sea]],&lt;ref name="Monserrat"/&gt;{{rp|1046}}&lt;ref name="NOAA Examination"/&gt;{{rp|8}} and the Western Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Monserrat"/&gt;{{rp|1044}}

The '''open-geomorphometry project''' is a 2012 open source computer code project created for the public availability of [[geomorphometry]] code. This code, written by Dr. Bob MacMillan, is known amongst its primary users as LandMapR&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan, R.A., VanDeusen, A.A., 2003. The LandMapR User's Guide. Self-Published.&lt;/ref&gt; (LandMapR has since become a copyrighted term in the U.S. for an agricultural remote sensing device).  LandMapR, and the new open-geomorphometry project, operate digital elevation data to produce maps including but not limited to: hydrological flow, catchments, depression or pits, water pooling, wetness index, topographic derivatives, and landform classifications.

==Origin==
LandMapR performs a number of operations on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), from calculating hydrological flow directions, water pooling, to performing sophisticated topographical landform classifications (see for example Jensen et al., (1988),&lt;ref&gt;Jensen S.K., Domingue, J.O., 1988. Extracting Topographic Structure from Digital Elevation Data for Geographic Information System Analysis. Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 54(11), 1593-1600.&lt;/ref&gt; or O'Callaghan et al., (1984)&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan, J.F., Mark, D.M., 1984. The Extraction of Drainage Networks from Digital Elevation Data.  Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing, 28, 323-344&lt;/ref&gt; and references therein).  LandMapR is an all-in-one tool for extracting information from DEMs.  The initial version of the software was written by Dr. Bob MacMillan as part of his Ph.D. thesis at the University of Edinburgh in 1993, and was coded in a Microsoft Rapid Application Development language called [[FoxPro]].  The [[FoxPro]] version exists to today, but is not part of the open source effort due to its restriction as an interpreted language.  The open-geomorphometry project makes the much faster C++ version of the software available.  

==Functions==
The most unusual aspects of LandMapR and the open-geomorphometry project are the algorithms it implements to conduct 'pit' removal.  Pits are depressions in the topography.  Pits are usually seen as interfering with the flow.  Typical pit removal (for example see Jensen et al. (1988)) involves simply removing depressions from DEMs in order to resolve flow paths.  LandMapR also conducts these operations on 'spurious' pits, but goes beyond normal pit removal procedures to treat watersheds, which are depressions, as a potential heirachichal path for flows and figures out how one pit might flow into another to produce new flow channels in a field.

The applications for this kind of pit-removal are almost unlimited.  Water and cold air pooling in vineyards and farm fields represent a serious issue in generating high yield crops.  For example, a farm field has recently been fertilized with granular heavy phosphorus fertilizer.  Knowing the distribution density of this fertilizer across the field it is possible to use pit removal to calculated the area to flow calculations as well as the potential residence times that would enable an estimate of how much rain is required to carry that fertilizer off into local streams.  The area to flow capability of the pit removal calculations in LandMapR are unique.

The open-source open-geomorphometry project forms the basis, or the geomorphology part, of some of the work being documented on the [[Phytogeomorphology]] page, and is the chosen software tool for much of that work.

==Digital elevation models==

A DEM, or [[digital elevation model]], is, most simply, a map at some resolution of the heights of land in a field or area.  The resolution of the DEM is usually stated in meters and is a measure of how much area each elevation estimate in the map covers.  In raster form, a DEM may be looked at as a regular grid of cells of various heights.  Increasing the resolution of the DEM, or making the cell size smaller, produces a closer estimate of the real surface.

DEMs can be produced in a number of ways (see, for example Moore et al., (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Moore, I.D., Grayson, R.B., Ladson, A.R., 1991. Digital Terrain Modelling: A review of hydrological, geomorphological, and biological applications. ''Hydrological Processes'', Vol. 5, 3-30&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilson et al., (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, J.P., Gallant, J.C., 2000. Terrain Analysis. Wiley {{ISBN|978-0471321880}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but the highest resolution DEMs result from dense [[LiDAR]] data.  Bangs et al., (2013)&lt;ref&gt;Bangs, D.E., Aspinall, J.D., Sweeney, S.J., Duncan, M.R., Lepp, S., Schuyler, B., 2013. Implications of three-dimensional agricultural landscape representation resolution on understanding the relationships between soil variability and crop yield: an example from Norfolk County, Ontario.Presented at the EOGC and CIG Annual Conference in Toronto. Paper #73.&lt;/ref&gt; recently performed a comparison of DEM resolutions and their ability to properly represent the surface of a farm field in Simcoe, Ontario using one of the highest density LiDAR data clouds ever attempted (some 240 million points on a field 1&amp;nbsp;km by 800 meters).  The paper concluded that DEM resolution well in excess of 1 meter was required to adequately represent a farm field at 5 meter resolution.

==Hydrology==

LandMapR as a [[hydrology|hydrological]] tool performs a number of useful operations on DEMs.  Within LandMapR are a number of distinct operations.  The original code had 19 operators that could be applied sequentially to the datasets.  The newer versions in the open source project break the tasks into four areas; flow calculations, pit removal (catchment hydrology), facets (landform derivatives), and form (landform derivatives).  Each section has a sequence of output maps.  Currently, the flow and pit removal calculations result in 5 major maps: flow direction, upslope contribution/area, watersheds, volume to flood, and millimeters to flood, and several minor maps that show the stages of pit removal.

==Landform Classification==

In the limited context of a [[landform]] being a component of a farm field topography, LandMapR is used to compute surface derivatives and other topological values, as well as using fuzzy logic to divide a farm field into a collection of landform classes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. MacMillan, David H. McNabb, R. Keith Jones (September 2000). "Conference paper: "Automated landform classification using DEMs""&lt;/ref&gt;  LandMapR is capable of defining a large number of landform classes and allowing the user to define criterion for membership in each of these classes.

A '''rainband''' is a [[cloud]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] structure associated with an area of rainfall which is significantly elongated.  Rainbands can be [[Nimbostratus cloud|stratiform]] or [[atmospheric convection|convective]],&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology (2009). [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=rainband&amp;submit=Search Rainband.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606102457/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=rainband&amp;submit=Search |date=2011-06-06 }} Retrieved on 2008-12-24.&lt;/ref&gt; and are generated by differences in temperature.  When noted on [[weather radar]] imagery, this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology (2009). [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=banded-structure1 Banded structure.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606102630/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=banded-structure1 |date=2011-06-06 }} Retrieved on 2008-12-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation.  Tropical cyclone rainbands contain showers and thunderstorms that, together with the eyewall and the eye, constitute a [[tropical cyclone|hurricane or tropical storm]].  The extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone's intensity.

Rainbands spawned near and ahead of [[cold front]]s can be [[squall line]]s which are able to produce [[tornado]]es.  Rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due to the formation of a low-level [[barrier jet]].  Bands of thunderstorms can form with [[sea breeze]] and [[land breeze]] boundaries, if enough moisture is present.  If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself.  Banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an [[extratropical cyclone]] can yield significant amounts of [[rain]] or [[snow]].  Behind extratropical cyclones, rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the [[Great Lakes]].  If the atmosphere is cold enough, these rainbands can yield heavy snow.

'''Robert A. Houze, Jr.''', is an American atmospheric scientist, researcher and author, Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric Sciences at the [[University of Washington]], and Laboratory Fellow of the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=Lab&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pnnl.gov/science/highlights/highlight.asp?id=4092|title= Atmospheric Sciences &amp; Global Change Staff Awards &amp; Honors}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the University of Washington, he led a research team known as the Mesoscale Group for 46 years. He and his group participated in international field projects around the world and global satellite programs employing weather radar and aircraft in the [[tropics]] and [[Middle latitudes|midlatitudes]], in projects sponsored by [[National Science Foundation|NSF]], [[NASA]], [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]], and [[NOAA]].&lt;ref name=symposium&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arm.gov/news/facility/post/35362|title= Robert Houze Honored with AMS Symposium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houze has been on the science teams for three NASA satellites for the global study of clouds and precipitation. The predominant areas of his research are tropical convective clouds, extreme storms, flooding in the Asian Monsoon, tropical cyclones, and midlatitude frontal systems in mountainous regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://honors.agu.org/honorsfellow/1886-houze/ |title=Robert Houze}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houze has published over 200 research articles and has authored a comprehensive book on the physics and dynamics of all types of clouds in the atmosphere entitled ''Cloud Dynamics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.49712051918 |title=Cloud dynamics.

Houze Jr. Symposium was organized to honor him at the [[American Meteorological Society|American Meteorological Society's]] Annual Meeting.&lt;ref name=symposium/&gt;

== Education and career ==
Born in Texas in 1945, Houze grew up in [[College Station, Texas|College Station]], near [[Texas A&amp;M University]], where he received a B.S. in Meteorology in 1967. He then attended the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), from which he received an M.S. in Meteorology in 1969, followed by a Ph.D. in Meteorology in 1972.{{cn|date=October 2018}} At MIT, his mentor was [[Pauline Austin]], a pioneer of using radar to study weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mit.edu/2017/celebrating-pauline-morrow-austin-founder-of-radar-meteorology-0131|title=Celebrating Pauline Morrow Austin, a founder of radar meteorology}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his Ph.D., Houze joined the University of Washington as an Assistant Professor in 1972 and rose to the level of full Professor in 1983. In 1988-89, he taught at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in [[Zurich]] as a Guest Professor. At the University of Washington, he has mentored 24 Ph.D.’s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://atmos.washington.edu/MG/people/rahvita.pdf|title=Robert A. Houze Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houze is a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society, and in 2006, he was awarded the Society’s highest research award, the [[Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0477-63.6.646|title=Annual Awards by American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a Fellow of the [[American Geophysical Union]], and in 2012 he delivered the Union’s Bjerknes Lecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 AGU Section and Focus Group Awardees and Named Lecturers|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2012EO460004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he became a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. He is a Fellow of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]], and in 2014 he received that Society’s highest research award, the [[Symons Gold Medal]].&lt;ref name=Symon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/blog/atmospheric-scientist-bob-houze-awarded-symons-gold-medal/|title=Atmospheric scientist Bob Houze awarded Symons Gold Medal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory designated Houze as a Laboratory Fellow, and since then he has held a joint University of Washington/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory appointment. He now spend about a quarter of his time with the Laboratory.&lt;ref name=Lab/&gt;

In 2017, the Robert A. Houze Jr. Symposium was organized to honor him at the American Meteorological Society's Annual Meeting.&lt;ref name=symposium/&gt;

== Research and work ==
When he arrived at the University of Washington in 1972, Houze began developing what became known as his Mesoscale Group. With this group, he conducted research for over 46 years. In the early years, he participated in the Global Atmospheric Research Programme’s Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE)—the largest field campaign ever to study weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=8719838|title=Mesoscale Cloud Systems and Their Effects on Larger Scales of Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt; In GATE, he was on board a ship instrumented with radar, and was one of the first to use radar to document a tropical squall line.&lt;ref name=Lab/&gt; Soon after GATE, he joined the international Monsoon Experiment (MONEX), in which he conducted radar studies on clouds in the winter monsoon in [[Malaysia]] in 1978-79. The MONEX study was one of the first field campaigns to collect airborne radar data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washington.edu/news/2017/01/25/monsoons-to-mosquitoes-uw-researchers-attend-national-weather-conference-in-seattle/|title=Monsoons to mosquitoes: UW researchers attend national weather conference in Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since these projects he has conducted radar studies over all the major oceans and over mountain ranges in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. The GATE experience launched a career of using radar on ships, islands and aircraft in field campaigns around the world—in [[northern Australia]], [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Africa]], the [[Italian Alps]], the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Maldives]], and various locations in the U.S.—especially to study fronts passing over the Cascade and Olympic Mountains, to fly into hurricanes over the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]], [[Atlantic]], and [[Pacific]], and to study thunderstorms over Kansas.&lt;ref name=symposium/&gt; In 2015, he led OLYMPEX in which numerous state-of-the-art radars were used to study how frontal storms moving from the Pacific Ocean over the Olympic Mountains produce enormous rainfall in the rain forests of northwestern North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/12/161201164803.htm|title=More frequent, more intense and longer-lasting storms cause heavier spring rain in central US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/rogue-storm-from-bay-of-bengal-caused-2010-pakistan-flooding.html| title= Rogue Storm From Bay of Bengal Caused 2010 Pakistan Flooding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], '''''rūpa''''' ([[Sanskrit]]; [[Pāli]]; [[Devanagari]]: {{linktext|रूप}}; {{lang-th|รูป}}) means 'form'. While it may be used to express matter or material phenomena, especially that linked to the power of vision in [[samkhya]], it is also used to describe subtle and spiritual realities such as ''svarupa'' meaning the form of the self.&lt;ref&gt;Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali, I.3. "“tadā draṣṭuh svarūpe ‘vasthānam” (Edwin F. Bryant. “The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali.” p.95)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to the Monier-Williams Dictionary (2006), rūpa is defined as:
:* ... any outward appearance or phenomenon or colour (often pl.) , form , shape , figure [[Rigveda|RV]]. &amp;c &amp;c ... 
:* to assume a form ; often ifc. = " having the form or appearance or colour of " , " formed or composed of " , " consisting of " , " like to " ....&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams Dictionary, pp. 885-6, entry for "Rūpa," retrieved 2008-03-06 from "Cologne University" at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/ (using "rUpa" as keyword) and http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0886-rUpakartR.jpg.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{PancaKhandha|figno=1}}
{{Chachakka|figno=2}}
In general, ''rūpa'' is the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]  [[concept]] of material form, including both the body and external matter.

More specifically, in the [[Pali Canon]], ''rūpa'' is contextualized in three significant frameworks:&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see Hamilton (2001), p. 3 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;''rūpa-khandha''&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; "material forms," one of the five aggregates (''[[skandha|khandha]]'') by which all phenomena can be categorized (see Fig. 1).
* &lt;u&gt;''rūpa-āyatana''&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; "visible objects," the external sense objects of the eye, one of the six external sense bases (''[[ayatana|āyatana]]'') by which the world is known (see Fig. 2).
* &lt;u&gt;''[[namarupa|nāma-rūpa]]''&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; "name and form" or "mind and body," which in the causal chain of dependent origination (''[[Pratītyasamutpāda|paticca-samuppāda]]'') arises from consciousness and leads to the arising of the sense bases.

In addition, more generally, ''rūpa'' is used to describe a statue, in which it is sometimes called [[Buddharupa]].

===''Rūpa-khandha''===
Rūpa is not matter as in the metaphysical substance of [[materialism]]. Instead it means both materiality and sensibility — signifying, for example, a tactile object both insofar as that object is made of matter and that the object can be tactically sensed. In fact rūpa is more essentially defined by its amenability to being sensed than its being matter: just like everything else it is defined in terms of its function; what it does, not what it is.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Chʼeng Wei-shih Lun.'' Routledge, 2002, page 183.&lt;/ref&gt; As matter, rūpa is traditionally analysed in two ways: as four primary elements (Pali, ''[[mahābhūta]]''); and, as ten or twenty-four secondary or derived elements.

==== Four primary elements ====
Existing ''rūpa'' consists in the four primary or underived (''no-upādā'') elements:   
* [[earth]] or solidity   
* [[fire]] or heat   
* [[water]] or cohesion   
* [[air]] or movement

==== Derived matter====
In the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]] and later [[Pali literature]],&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (2001), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; ''rūpa'' is further analyzed in terms of ten or twenty-three or twenty-four types of secondary or derived (''upādā'') matter. In the list of ten types of secondary matter, the following are identified:
* eye
* ear
* nose
* tongue
* body&lt;ref&gt;Here, "body" (''kāya'') refers to that which senses "touch" (''pho{{IAST|ṭṭ}}habba'').  In the [[Upanishad]]s, "skin" is used instead of "body" (Rhys Davids, 1900, p. 172 ''n''. 3).&lt;/ref&gt;
* form
* sound
* odour   
* taste
* touch&lt;ref&gt;The first ten secondary elements are the same as the first five (physical) [[ayatana|sense bases]] and their sense objects (e.g., see Hamilton, 2001, pp. 6-7).&lt;/ref&gt;

If twenty-four secondary types are enumerated, then the following fifteen are added to the first nine of the above ten: 
* femininity  
* masculinity or virility   
* life or vitality
* heart or heart-basis&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Visuddhimagga|Vsm]]. XIV, 60 (Buddhaghosa, 1999, p. 447), the heart-basis provides material support for the mind (''mano'') and mind consciousness.  In the [[Sutta Pitaka]], a material basis for the mind sphere (''[[āyatana]]'') is never identified.&lt;/ref&gt;
* physical indications (movements that indicate intentions)   
* vocal indications   
* space element   
* physical lightness or buoyancy   
* physical yieldingness or plasticity
* physical handiness or wieldiness
* physical grouping or integration
* physical extension or maintenance
* physical aging or decay
* physical impermanence   
* food&lt;ref&gt;The list of 24 can be found, for instance, in the [[Visuddhimagga]] (Vsm. XIV, 36 ff.) (Buddhaghosa, 1999, pp. 443 ff.; and, Hamilton, 2001, p. 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of 23 derived types can be found, for instance, in the Abhidhamma Pitaka's [[Dhammasangani]] (e.g., Dhs. 596), which omits the list of 24 derived types' "heart-basis."&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Dhammasangani|Dhs]]. 596 (Rhys Davids, 2000, p. 172) and [[Visuddhimagga|Vsm]]. XIV, 36 (Buddhaghosa, 1999, p. 443).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shrinkage'''(in fabric) is a parameter of testing textile fabrics to measure changes in length and width after washing (laundry), shrinkage failing materials are  dimensionally unstable and they can cause de shaping and deforming of the garments or products made out of those materials, it is tested at various stages but important is to before cutting the fabric into further sewn products and after cutting and sewing  prior to supplying the products to buyers and end users.It is a necessarily required parameter of quality control to ensure the sizes of the products to avoid any complaints regarding deformation or change in dimensions after domestic laundry&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laundry &lt;/ref&gt;. The tests&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aatcc.org/test/methods/&lt;/ref&gt; are conducted with provided specifications of buyers imitating the same conditions like washing cycle time, temperature and water ratio and fabric load and sometimes top loading and front loading washing machines are chosen to authenticate the test and assurance of the results. This procedure&lt;ref&gt;https://members.aatcc.org/store/lp001/2212/&lt;/ref&gt; provides standard and alternate home laundering conditions using an automatic washing machine. While the procedure includes several options, it is not possible to include every existing combination of laundering parameters. The test is applicable to all fabrics and end products suitable for home laundering.

== Types of shrinkage ==
Shrinkage is a change in dimensions across the length and width of the fabric after washing, usage and when exposed to relaxing of fabrics. Mainly shrinkage is of two types one is minus shrinkage and other is plus shrinkage. Skew (twisting of the vertical grains) is also observed along with shrinkage. Abnormal twisting is also considered as a non-conformity. 
# Contraction:  Any noticeable decrease in dimensions is known as Contraction'''(minus) shrinkage'''.
# Expansion:  Any noticeable increase or expansion in dimension is known as Expansion '''(plus) shrinkage'''.

==Causes==

* '''Composition and properties''' of the fibres&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber&lt;/ref&gt;
Composition and content determine the type and percentage of fibres. Natural fibres shrink more than synthetic fibres. Synthetic fibres are more stable due to their crystalline and thermoplastic nature. They do not shrink, whereas natural fibres are more prone to shrink because of more amorphous region in their fibre structure which allows more absorption of water, swelling of fibres and increased lubricity increases the shrinking tendency. Blended fabrics normally synthetic and natural are also considered more stable.
* '''Structure of the fabric'''/ knit or weave, loose and tight structure
This factor also plays a vital role in the shrinking of the products. The products which are loosely woven or knitted are prone to shrink more and tightly knitted and woven products are more stable. The main reason is that [[knitted fabric]]s shrinkage is because they are made by interlooping the yarn which is comparatively a loose and flexible structure whereas woven are considered more stable and less sensitive to shrinkage.
* '''[[Finishing (textiles)|Finishing]] applications and procedures
Fibres to fabric conversion implies lots of mechanical tensions and forces during manufacturing, which includes following steps for fibre to yarn conversion with [[Spinning_(textiles)|spinning]] then fabric with [[weaving]], [[knitting]].
When the products are immersed in water, the water acts as a relaxing medium and all stresses and strains get relaxed and try to come back to its original relaxed state. Even after finishing with sophisticated finishing machines some residual shrinkage remains, which is carried forward to the garment stage. This residual shrinkage may cause deformity or de-shaping of the products after domestic laundry. There are certain acceptance limits of shrinkage levels for every product. Abnormal shrinkage levels are considered a non-conformity to quality standards.

== Test methods ==
The different test methods are used as per the final destination of the product like in Europe, U.S.A., etc.and expected washing or laundry methods in practice over there.Mainly [[International_Organization_for_Standardization|I.S.O.]] and [[American_Association_of_Textile_Chemists_and_Colorists|AATCC]] standards are used for shrinkage testing. There are few brands which are customizing the test method as per their quality norms.

AATCC Test Method 135, Dimensional Change of Fabrics After Home Laundering
Scope: Determines the dimensional changes of garments when subjected to home laundering procedures used by consumers. The method is for fabric not yet made into a garment. A sample is marked with benchmarks before home laundering. Then it is laundered 3 times total, then the benchmarks are measured again. Before and after laundering benchmarks are compared.

AATCC Test Method 150, Dimensional Change of Fabrics After Home Laundering
Scope: Determines the dimensional changes of garments when subjected to home laundering procedures used by consumers.

== Importance ==
Shrinkage has great importance because any expansion or shrinkage can deform the product which could be a serious concern for end-user and brand can lose its reputation.
== Shrinkage controlling methods ==
There are various procedures to minimise the residual shrinkage of the fabrics,it begins with right selection of yarn count or denier to achieve particular g.s.m(Grams per square meters),Right selection of tightness factor of loops (which is called loop length then chemical procedures like mercerising of cotton,Resin&lt;ref&gt;https://thebusinesstactics.com/519691/global-urea-formaldehyde-resin-market-2025-company-and-financial-overview-product-portfolio-business-strategies-and-recent-developments/&lt;/ref&gt; of cotton in case of woven materials,Pre- heat-setting and post heat setting of synthetic and blended fabrics( Heat setting&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heatsetting&lt;/ref&gt; is a thermal process taking place mostly in either a steam atmosphere or a dry heat environment. The effect of the process gives fibers, yarns or fabric dimensional stability). 
Finishing on machines like sanphorizing&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanforization&lt;/ref&gt;  Mechanical shrinking (sometimes referred to as sanforizing), whereby the fabric is forced to shrink width and/or lengthwise, creates a fabric in which any residual tendency to shrink after subsequent laundering is minimal compacting&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendering_(textiles)&lt;/ref&gt; machines. For [[wool]] garments, shrinkage is due to scales on the fibers which heat, water and agitation cause to stick together.  Other fabrics are stretched by mechanical forces during production, and can shrink slightly when heated (though to a lesser degree than wool).  Some clothes are shrunk in the factory to avoid this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=98759520|title=Why Clothes Shrink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sura Ionospheric Heating Facility''', located near the small town of [[Vasilsursk]] about 100&amp;nbsp;km eastward from [[Nizhniy Novgorod]] in [[Russia]], is a [[laboratory]] for [[ionosphere]] research {{#tag:ref|{{cite web|title = sura nirfi.sci|url = http://sura.nirfi.sci-nnov.ru/indexe.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020809060208/http://sura.nirfi.sci-nnov.ru/indexe.html|dead-url = yes|archive-date = August 9, 2002|accessdate = February 13, 2015}}}}.
Sura is capable of radiating about 190 [[watt|MW]], [[effective radiated power]] (ERP) on short waves {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}. This facility is operated by the radiophysical research institute [[NIRFI]] in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}. The Sura facility was commissioned in 1981 {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. Using this facility, Russian researchers studied the behaviour of the ionosphere and the effect of generation of low-frequency emission on modulation of ionosphere current. In the beginning, the Soviet Defense Department mostly footed the bill. The American [[HAARP]] [[ionospheric heater]], whose operation began in 1993, is similar to the Sura facility.



==Technical information==
The frequency range of the heating facility is from 4.5 to 9.3&amp;nbsp;MHz. 
The facility consists of three 250&amp;nbsp;kW broadcasting transmitters and a 144 crossed dipole antenna-array with dimensions of 300 m x 300 m.

At the middle of the operating frequency range (4.5 – 9.3&amp;nbsp;MHz) a maximum zenith gain of about 260 (~24 dB) is reached, the ERP of the facility is 190 MW (~83 dbW).

It is bounded by the [[Kunlun Mountains]] to the south, the [[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Tian Shan]] (ancient [[Mount Imeon]]) to the west and north, and the [[Gobi Desert]] to the east.

The name may be an [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] borrowing of the [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa-Latn|tark}}, "to leave alone/out/behind, relinquish, abandon" + {{lang|fa-Latn|makan}}, "place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=E.

Some [[geographer]]s and [[ecology|ecologists]] prefer to regard the Taklamakan Desert as separate and independent from the [[Gobi Desert]] region to its east. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[China|The People's Republic of China]] has constructed two cross-desert highways. The [[Tarim Desert Highway]] links the cities of [[Hotan]] (on the southern edge) and [[Luntai]] (on the northern edge), and the [[Bayingol]] to [[Ruoqiang Town|Ruoqiang]] road crosses the desert to the east. In recent years, the desert has expanded in some areas, its sands enveloping farms and villages as a result of [[desertification]].

The [[Golmud-Korla Railway]] (presently, under construction; expected completion time, 2019) will cross the Taklamakan as well.

==Climate==

Because it lies in the [[rain shadow]] of the Himalayas, Taklamakan is a paradigmatic cold [[desert climate]]. Given its relative proximity with the cold to frigid [[air mass]]es in [[Siberia]], extreme temperatures are recorded in wintertime, sometimes well below {{convert|−20|C|0}}, while in summer they can rise up to {{convert|40|C|0}}. During the [[2008 Chinese winter storms]] episode, the Taklamakan was reported to be covered, for the first time in its history, entirely with a thin layer of snow reaching {{convert|4|cm|in}}, with a temperature of {{convert|−26.1|C|0}} in some observatories.&lt;ref name = xinhuanetdesertsnow&gt;{{cite news

Its extreme inland position, virtually in the very heartland of Asia and thousands of kilometres from any open body of water, accounts for the somewhat wide [[diurnal temperature variation]].

==Oasis==

The left side appears blue from water flowing in many streams. The picture is taken in May, when the river is full with the snow/glacier meltwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=38%C2%B053%E2%80%B228%E2%80%B3N,+82%C2%B010%E2%80%B240%E2%80%B3E&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.301914,84.340668&amp;spn=0.805076,1.203003&amp;t=h&amp;z=10 | title=38°53'28.0"n 82°10'40.0"e}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Taklamakan Desert has very little water, therefore it is hazardous to cross. Merchant caravans on the [[Silk Road]] would stop for relief at the thriving [[oasis]] towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The key oasis towns, watered by rainfall from the mountains, were [[Kashgar]], [[Marin (China)|Marin]], [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]], [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]], and [[Hotan|Khotan]] (Hetian) to the south, [[Kuqa]] and [[Turpan]] in the north, and [[Loulan]] and [[Dunhuang]] in the east.&lt;ref name="atlas"/&gt; Now, many, such as Miran and [[Gaochang]], are ruined cities in sparsely inhabited areas in the [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Autonomous Region]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="road"&gt;{{cite book

Later, the Taklamakan was inhabited by [[Turkic peoples]]. Starting with the [[Han Dynasty]], the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] sporadically extended their control to the oasis cities of the Taklamakan Desert in order to control the important [[Silk Road|silk route]] trade across Central Asia. Periods of Chinese rule were interspersed with rule by Turkic, [[Mongols|Mongol]] and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] peoples. The present population consists largely of Turkic [[Uyghur people]] and ethnic [[Han people]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-16860974 Xinjiang territory profile], BBC News.

==Scientific exploration==
This desert was explored by several scientists such as [[Xuanzang]], a monk in the [[7th century]] and by the archaeologist [[Aurel Stein]] in the [[20th century]].

Atmospheric studies have shown that dust originating from the Taklamakan is blown over the Pacific, where it contributes to cloud formation over the Western United States. Studies have shown that a specific class of mineral found in the dust, known as [[K-feldspar]], triggers ice formation particularly well. K-feldspar is particularly susceptible to corrosion by acidic atmospheric pollution such as nitrates and phosphates. Exposure to these constituents reduces the ability of the dust to trigger water droplet formation. Further, the traveling dust redistributes minerals from the Taklamakan to the western U.S.A. via rainfall.&lt;ref name="The Dust Detectives"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Fox |first=Douglas |date=2014-12-22 |title=The Dust Detectives |url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/46.22/the-dust-detectives |magazine=High Country News |volume=46 |issue=22 |access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The desert is the main setting for Chinese film series ''[[Painted Skin (2008 film)|Painted Skin]]'' and ''[[Painted Skin: The Resurrection]]''. The Chinese TV series ''[[Candle in the Tomb (TV series)|Candle in the Tomb]]'' is mostly spent in this desert as they are searching for the ancient city of Jinjue (see [[Niya (Tarim Basin)]].)

The issue #39 'Soft Places' of Neil Gaiman's ''[[The Sandman_(Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' takes place in the desert, when [[Marco Polo]] gets lost in the desert.
