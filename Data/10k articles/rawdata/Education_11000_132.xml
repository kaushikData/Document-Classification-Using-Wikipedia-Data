Tertiary schools in the [[Philippines]] have different grading systems. Most universities and colleges, particularly [[State Universities and Colleges (Philippines)|those established by the government]], follows the grade point system scale of 5.00 to 1.00, in which 1.00 is the highest possible grade and 5.00 is the lowest possible grade.

Some universities may follow the 1.00 – 4.00 grading system, which is patterned after the U.S. grading system. This system uses the 4.00 grade point equivalence as the highest grade, while 1.00 grade point equivalence is considered the lowest possible grade. 0.00 grade point equivalence is considered a failing mark.

GWA ([[general weighted average]]) is a representation (often numerical) of the overall scholastic standing of students used for evaluation. GWA is based on the grades in all subjects taken at a particular level including subjects taken outside of the curriculum. Representation of the subjects taken only in a specific curriculum is called CWA, or '''curriculum weighted average'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.pregi.net/gsdl/collect/actamedi/index/assoc/HASH019c.dir/doc.pdf. - Learning Styles in the University of the Philippines College of Medicine]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

More importantly, Philippine universities do not have standard grade equivalence. Different universities have varied equivalence range, while passing grades are subject to imposed academic quality of an institution.

'''Anne Marie Milan Desguillons''' née ''Milan'' (8 May 1753–28 July 1829) was a French stage actress.  She was active in [[French theater of Gustav III]] in Sweden in 1781-92, and principal of the ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]'' jointly with [[Joseph Sauze Desguillons]] 1793-98.

==Life==
Anne Marie Milan debuted in [[Le Havre]] 1773, and was active in [[Lille]] 1774–75.

===French theater of Gustav III===

In 1781, she arrived in Sweden as a member of the newly created French theater troupe of [[Jacques Marie Boutet de Monvel]], which was engaged by king [[Gustav III of Sweden]] to perform for the Swedish royal court.

The [[French Theater of Gustav III|French Theatre]] performed at the court theatres in [[Gripsholm Castle]], [[Drottningholm Palace Theatre]] and [[Confidencen]] at [[Ulriksdal Palace]] for the Swedish royal court: from the season of 1783-84, they also performed for the public at [[Bollhuset]] in [[Stockholm]] in winters, though the audience normally consisted exclusively of the upper class society, who could speak French.

Anne Marie Milan Desguillons became a highly valued member member of the French theater and was favored by the king.  To her appearance, she was described as heavily overweight and not regarded to be beautiful, but she was much praised for her artistic talent and enjoyed great respect particularly within the court. 
She was foremost a [[tragedienne]], performed in tragedies and ''[[mére noble]]''roles, and was normally given main parts in the French tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Sauze Desguillons, urn:sbl:17492, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av O. WlESELGREN.), hämtad 2018-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among her parts was [[Merope (Pleiades)|Merope]], [[Semiramis]] and [[Athalie]], but she did occasionally perform comic parts, such as [[Turcaret|Madame Turcaret]].

In 1789, she married her colleague Joseph Sauze Desguillons, and thus required the name Desguillons.

===Instructor and principal===

After the assassination of Gustav III in 1792, the French theater was dissolved.  Desguillons retired from the stage but chose to remain in Sweden.

In 1793, Anne Marie Milan Desguillons and her spouse Joseph Sauze Desguillons where appointed joint principals of the acting school ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]''. The school had been founded in 1787, but the Desguillons couple was responsible for giving it a proper organisation, which was kept by their successor [[Sofia Lovisa Gråå]].

The two Desguillons were also instructors at the school.  They instructed the students in drama, while the music lessons was given by [[Johann Christian Friedrich Hæffner]] and L. Piccini, and the dancing lessons by [[Julie Alix de la Fay]] and [[Jean-Rémy Marcadet]].  They pupils where enrolled at the age of nine or ten and performed as child actors in minor plays as well as in special pupil's plays staged by the school. 
 
She was responsible for the female students, and her husband for the male students.  They are known as the mentors of many later famous Swedish stage artists in Swedish theater history, and thus contributed greatly in shaping the contemporary Swedish acting method in a French pattern.  Among her more known students was [[Jeanette Wässelius]], [[Sofia Frodelius]], [[Ulrika Wennerholm]] and [[Carolina Kuhlman]].  Anne Marie Milan Desguillons retired as a principal in 1798.

In 1803, king [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]] engaged a French theatre company to perform, and the Desguillons couple were made joint directors responsible of the company during its stay in Sweden. They kept this role until the French company left in 1806.

'''Applied history''' is the effort to apply insights grounded in the study of the past to the challenges of the present, particularly in the area of policy-making. Applied history is closely associated with the field of [[public history]], and the terms today are sometimes used interchangeably, though historically, public history has been a more encompassing term, engaging a broad range of audiences, subjects and methods, while applied history has been more narrowly focused on work associated with the development of domestic and foreign policy.

== History ==

The term "applied history" was coined in 1909 by political scientist and historian Benjamin Shambaugh (1871-1940).&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Conard, Benjamin Shambaugh and the Intellectual Foundations of Public History (Iowa City: Iowa University Press, 2002), 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  A founding member of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association (today the [[Organization of American Historians]]), Shambaugh edited its proceedings from 1909 to 1914 and served as its president in 1909-1910. In 1912, Shambaugh, then superintendent of the State Historical Society of Iowa, launched the publication ''Applied History'', a series that ran until 1930.  Shambaugh defined applied history as "the use of the scientific knowledge of history and experience in efforts to solve present problems of human betterment."&lt;ref&gt;The American Historical Review, Vol. 18, No. 2 (Jan., 1913), p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples included legislative reference work and policy analysis, as well as the creation and stewardship of public archives, and the practice of state and local history.&lt;ref&gt;Conard, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Applied History '' series, and related efforts, lost funding during the Great Depression, and "applied history" as an enterprise receded until the 1970s, when it re-emerged in new contexts and forms.  In 1974, Harvard University historian [[Ernest May (historian)|Ernest May]] published '''Lessons of the Past': The Use and Abuse Of History in American Foreign Policy'', which argues that more substantive engagement with the discipline of history would improve policymaking. May together with [[Richard Neustadt]] taught courses in which students were invited to apply historical insight to contemporary social issues; in 1986 May and Neustadt published ''Thinking in Time: The Uses of History for Decision-Makers''.  In 1975, historians Joel Tarr and Peter Stearns launched an Applied History program at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Peter N. Stearns and Joel A. Tarr. "Curriculum in Applied History: Toward the Future". ''The Public Historian''. vol. 9, no. 3, Summer 1987, pp. 111-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  This Ph.D. program aimed to prepare students for jobs in a variety of public and private educational institutions. In the 1980s, the program changed its name from “Applied History” to “History and Policy.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/history/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are a number of academic programs in applied history. Shippensburg University hosts a Center for Applied History, and there is an Applied History Project at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.

In November 2018, academic publisher [[Brill Publishers]] launched the ''Journal of Applied History''.

''' Barry Unsworth''' [[FRSL]] (10 August 1930{{spaced ndash}}4 June 2012) was an English writer known for his historical fiction. He published 17 novels, and was shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]] three times, winning once for the 1992 novel ''[[Sacred Hunger]]''.

==Biography==
Unsworth was born on 10 August 1930&lt;ref&gt;Some sources say 8 August&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Wingate, County Durham|Wingate]], a mining village in [[County Durham]], England, to a family of miners.&lt;ref name=flood/&gt;&lt;ref name=crossen/&gt; His father first entered the mines at age 12 and ordinarily Unsworth would have followed him as a [[miner]]. However, when his father was 19, he travelled to the United States for a few years and on returning to Britain entered the insurance business and thus began moving his family up the economic ladder and out of the mines.&lt;ref name=crossen/&gt; "He rescued my brother and me from that long chain of continuity that happens in mining villages," Unsworth said.&lt;ref name=crossen/&gt;

He graduated from the [[University of Manchester]] in 1951, and lived in France for a year teaching English. He also travelled extensively in [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] during the 1960s, lecturing at the [[University of Athens]] and the [[University of Istanbul]].&lt;ref name=flood/&gt; His novels about [[fin-de-siecle]] [[Ottoman Empire]], ''The Rage of the Vulture'' and ''Pascali's Island'', were inspired by these experiences. He published his first novel in 1966, his second novel, ''[[The Greeks Have a Word For It]]'', was an outgrowth of his teaching experience in Athens.

In 1999 he was a visiting professor at the [[University of Iowa]]'s [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]. In 2004 he taught literature and creative writing classes at [[Kenyon College]] in [[Ohio]].

In the last years of his life, he lived in [[Perugia]], a city in the [[Umbria]] region of Italy, with his second wife, a Finnish national. His novel ''After Hannibal'' is a fictionalised description of his efforts at settlement in the Italian countryside.

Unsworth died in Perugia, Italy in 2012, of lung cancer.&lt;ref name=flood&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/08/barry-unsworth-booker-prizewinner-dies |author=Alison Flood |date=8 June 2012 |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Barry Unsworth, Booker prizewinner, dies at 81 |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crossen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Margalit (7 June 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/books/barry-unsworth-historical-novelist-dies-at-81.html? Barry Unsworth, Writer of Historical Fiction, Dies at 81] ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved 8 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was 81. Unsworth died the same day as [[Ray Bradbury]]; as [[Cynthia Crossen]] said in the ''Wall Street Journal'', "Mr. Bradbury invented the future; Mr. Unsworth invented the past."&lt;ref name=crossen&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303734204577466801039528644 |author=Cynthia Crossen |date=18 June 2012 |title=A Tribute to Barry Unsworth |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Unsworth's first novel, ''[[The Partnership (novel)|The Partnership]]'', was published in 1966 when he was 36. "...in my earlier novels, especially the two written in the early '70s, ''The Hide'' and ''Mooncranker's Gift'', there was a baroque quality in the style, a density. The mood was grim, but the language was more figurative and more high-spirited. There was more delight in it, more self-indulgence, too. Among my earliest influences as a writer were the American novelists of the deep south, especially Eudora Welty, and some of that elated, grotesque comedy stayed with me." ''[[Mooncranker's Gift]]'' (1973) won the [[Heinemann Award]]). Other novels included ''[[Stone Virgin]]'' (1985) and ''[[Losing Nelson]]'' (1999). In addition to [[Eudora Welty]], he counted [[William Faulkner]] and [[Carson McCullers]] as his major influences.

Unsworth did not start to write historical fiction until his sixth novel, ''[[Pascali's Island (novel)|Pascali's Island]]'' (1980), the first of his novels to be shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]]. ''Pascali's Island'' is set on an unnamed Aegean island during the last years of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Reflecting on this shift, Unsworth explained: "Nowadays I go to Britain relatively rarely and for short periods; in effect, I have become an expatriate. The result has been a certain loss of interest in British life and society and a very definite loss of confidence in my ability to register the contemporary scene there – the kind of things people say, the styles of dress, the politics etc.– with sufficient subtlety and accuracy. So I have turned to the past. The great advantage of this, for a writer of my temperament at least, is that one is freed from a great deal of surface clutter. One is enabled to take a remote period and use it as a distant mirror (to borrow Barbara Tuchman’s phrase), and so try to say things about our human condition – then and now – which transcend the particular period and become timeless." A [[Pascali's Island (film)|film version]] directed by [[James Dearden]], starring [[Charles Dance]], [[Helen Mirren]] and [[Ben Kingsley]], as the title character, was released in 1988.

''[[Morality Play (novel)|Morality Play]]'', shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1995, is a murder mystery set in 14th century England about a travelling troupe of players that put on Bible plays.&lt;ref name=crossen/&gt; It was adapted as a film, ''[[The Reckoning (2003 film)|The Reckoning]]'' (2003), starring [[Paul Bettany]] and [[Willem Dafoe]].

''[[Sacred Hunger]]'' (1992) centres on the Atlantic slave trade that moves from [[Liverpool]] to West Africa, Florida and the West Indies. It was joint winner of the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1992, along with [[Michael Ondaatje]]'s ''[[The English Patient]]''. It is generally considered his masterpiece.&lt;ref name=crossen/&gt; The story is set in the mid-18th century and centres around the ''Liverpool Merchant'', a slave ship employed in the [[triangular trade]], a central trade route in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. The two main characters are cousins Erasmus Kemp, son of a wealthy merchant from [[Lancashire]], and Matthew Paris, a physician and scientist who goes on the voyage. The novel's central theme is [[greed]], with the subject of [[slavery]] being a primary medium for exploring how selfish desire for profit can result in evil and barbarism.&lt;ref name=crossen/&gt; The "sacred hunger" of the title refers to the [[profit motive]]. The story line has a very extensive cast of characters, some featuring in only one scene, others continually developed throughout the story, but most described in intricate detail. The narrative interweaves elements of appalling cruelty and horror with extended comedic interludes, and employs frequent period expressions. A sequel, ''[[The Quality of Mercy (Barry Unsworth book)|The Quality of Mercy]]'', was published in 2011, it was his last book.

''[[Sugar and Rum]]'' (1988) was a novel set in contemporary [[Liverpool]] about a writer who is trying to write a novel about the Liverpool slave trade, and who is suffering from [[writer's block]]; Unsworth wrote this novel to try to get over his own block during the writing of ''Sacred Hunger''.

==Style==
Unsworth's style is not heaped in historical minutiae, "I don't really care how many buttons someone had on his waistcoat. It would be good to get it right, but what really matters is trying to get hold of the spirit of the age, what it was like to be alive in that age, what it felt like to be…an ordinary person in the margins of history."&lt;ref name=crossen/&gt;

In regards to writing and growing old, Unsworth said, "With time I have grown more sparing with the words. I think less of fire-works and flourishes. I try to get warmth and colour through precision of language. This is more difficult, I think, which may be why I find writing novels so challenging and exacting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kwls.org/littoral/intensity_of_ilusiona_conversa/ |title=Intensity of Illusion: a conversation with Barry Unsworth |date=28 June 2008 |work=Littoral |publisher=KWLS (Key West Literary Seminar) |author=Arlo Haskell |accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have attacked historical fiction as being un-literary, for example [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] writing in ''The New Yorker'' called it a "somewhat gimcrack genre not exactly jammed with greatness."&lt;ref name=crossen/&gt; However Unsworth defended the form, saying "The term historical fiction is a blunt instrument in literary criticism. When people ask, 'Is it a good historical novel?' they may as well ask, 'Is it a good Protestant novel?' or 'Is it a good transvestite novel?' I write stories that are set in the past. Fiction set in the past should be judged by the same criteria as any other fiction. Does the novel convey a sense of life, touch the reader's mind and heart? Does it belong to what [[D.H. Lawrence]] called the one bright book of life?"&lt;ref name=crossen/&gt;

Originally, it derives from a donation of around 3400 volumes of the bibliophile Isidre Bonsoms from [[Barcelona]] in 1915. 
It includes the works of [[Miguel de Cervantes]] in original language and translations, works of biographic character and literary criticism as well as adapted and inspired works and Cervantine iconography.

== History ==

In 1914 [[Isidre Bonsoms i Sicart]] (1849-1922), a Catalan bibliophile and erudite, communicated to the responsibles of the [[Biblioteca de Catalunya]], inspector Jaume Massó i Torrants and director [[Jordi Rubió]] y Balaguer, his plan to transfer the Cervantine collection that he had gathered in many years of laborious searches to the library. A large part of these collected books came originally from the collection of Leopold Rius (1840-1898) who is considered as the father of the modern Cervantine bibliography.&lt;ref&gt; Reial Acadèmia de Bones Lletres; Associació de Bibliófils de Barcelona, ed. (2010). ''La correspondencia entre Isidre Bonsoms Sicart y Archer Milton Huntington: el coleccionismo de libros antiguos y objetos de arte''. Barcelona. p. 42. {{ISBN|978-84-933-284-1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the recently founded library received the collection of 3.367 volumes in 1915, the items were stored in the Blue Room of the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] in the Palacio de la Generalidad - at that time head quarters of the library. In 1936 they were moved from this site to the Sala Cervantina of the Biblioteca de Catalunya in the former building of the Hospital de la Santa Cruz. In order to promote the accessibility of these precious books, the Institut d’Estudis Catalans hired Joan Givanel as the first keeper of the collection to start the project of a catalogue in 1915.

Due to further donations, acquisitions, exchange and the legal deposit the collection has been developed over the past years and is still continuing to grow. Thus, it currently counts around 9.000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Biblioteca de Catalunya (ed.).

== Content and particular items ==

Despite the bibliographic value of the whole collection, one might also consider the high individual value of numerous pieces.

The collection contains the first editions of every Cervantine work in original language and translations except from ''La Galatea''&lt;ref&gt;Escobedo, Joana (20 de marzo 2012). Biblioteca de Catalunya, ed. [http://www.bnc.cat/El-Blog-de-la-BC/La-Sala-Cervantina-de-la-Biblioteca-de-Catalunya «La Sala Cervantina de la Biblioteca de Catalunya»] (in catalán).

The following most valuable items of the famous work of Miguel de Cervantes, ''Don Quijote'', form part of the collection:

*One of the items of the six editions of the first part that were printed in 1605. According to ''Censo de ejemplares'' elaborated by a group of the Investigación Prinqeps 1605, lead by Victor Infentes, there are 28 items of the first edition existent, [http://cataleg.bnc.cat/record=b1487880~S13*cat of which one] of them is conserved at the Biblioteca de Catalunya.

*Items of all 65 editions realized during the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. 

*One item of the [http://cataleg.bnc.cat/record=b1488699~S13*cat first joint edition of both parts] first published in Barcelona in 1617.&lt;ref&gt; Biblioteca de Catalunya, ed. (2005). ''El Quixot: un heroi de paper, els papers d’un heroi''. Barcelona. p. 54. &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3226">'''Citizenship education''' for new citizens is education intended to prepare noncitizens to become legally and socially accepted as [[citizens]], and is carried out by a variety of governmental and non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]).

==Belgium==
An integration programme is organised in the [[Flanders|Flemish Region]] of Belgium. The programma is obliged in many cases and consists of an "integration course" (citizenship education) a basic level Dutch course, and career orientation. It is also possible to enroll in the programme in [[Brussels]], without any obligation.
==Germany==
In order to obtain German citizenship it is compulsory for a citizen to pass an "Integrationkurs" - which teaches the basics of the [[German language]] and German culture and society, such as the German legal system, history and culture, rights and obligations in Germany etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bamf.de/EN/Willkommen/DeutschLernen/Integrationskurse/InhaltAblauf/inhaltablauf-node.html;jsessionid=CA02CE883966C546DAFBFB4EFAD0F913.1_cid286|title=BAMF - Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge  -  Content and scheduling|website=www.bamf.de|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Netherlands==
In the Netherlands the citizen education for new citizens is called "inburgeringsplicht" (see [[Integration law for new immigrants to the Netherlands]]). In many cases the foreigner is obliged to learn very basic Dutch and basic knowledge about Dutch society while still abroad and he or she must pass an exam abroad before receiving a visa for temporary residence. All this depends on certain criteria (especially what country the foreigner comes from).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ind.nl/en/inbedrijf/wonenenwerken/basisexamen15maart.asp Civic integration examination abroad introduced] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216165323/http://ind.nl/en/inbedrijf/wonenenwerken/basisexamen15maart.asp |date=2010-12-16 }} website of [[Immigratie en Naturalisatiedienst]] retrieved 2010-April-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the [United States], government programs prepared [[immigrant]]s to take citizenship exams or qualify for citizenship. Many corporations, most prominently [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], offered similar programs to their employees and families of their employees.  In addition, various charities also provided this service.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] in 2002, [[David Blunkett]] introduced a series of proposals where immigrants would take a written "test" and participate in a ceremony before they could be granted British nationality. Before being given a passport, applicants read [[Life in the United Kingdom]] (a book providing information about the UK), prepare for and sit a 45-minute test on British society, history and culture.

'''Claudia Goldin''' (born May 14, 1946) is the Henry Lee Professor of Economics at  [[Harvard University]] and director of the Development of the American Economy program at the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]]. Goldin was the president of the [[American Economic Association]] in 2013–14 and winner of the 2016 IZA Prize in Labor Economics "for her career-long work on the economic history of women in education and the labor market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IZA Prize in Labor Economics|url=http://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/prize/iza_prize|publisher=IZA – Institute of Labor Economics|accessdate=28 June 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, she became the first woman to be tenured at the Harvard economics department.&lt;ref name=crims/&gt;

==Education and work==
Goldin was born in [[New York City]] in 1946. She attended the [[Bronx High School of Science]] and [[Cornell University]] and completed her doctorate in economics at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Zollinger Giele]] and Leslie F. Stebbins. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CdCjACqXU4wC&amp;pg=PA179 ''Women and Equality In the Workplace: A Reference Handbook'']. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-57607-937-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her research interests include [[economic history]], [[labor economics]], gender and economics, and the economics of work, family, and education. Some of her more recent papers include "The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women's Employment, Education, and Family",  which describes and analyses changes in female labor force participation over the past century, "The Homecoming of American College Women: The Reversal of the Gender Gap in College" (with [[Lawrence F. Katz]] and Ilyana Kuziemko), which probes the causes of the upsurge in women’s college attendance, and "A Pollution Theory of Discrimination: Male and Female Occupations and Earnings", which addresses [[gender pay gap|wage differentials]] between men and women.

In 1990, Goldin became the first [[tenure]]d woman at Harvard's economics department.&lt;ref name=crims&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Sophie M.|title=Goldin Demystifies Gender Economics|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2007/4/26/goldin-demystifies-gender-economics-gender-will/|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|date=April 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She collaborates frequently with [[Lawrence F. Katz]], a fellow economics professor at Harvard, who is a "[[Significant other|personal]] as well as research partner".&lt;ref name=common&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jonas|first1=Michael|title=Learning curve|url=http://www.commonwealthmagazine.org/Voices/Conversation/2011/Fall/001-Learning-curve.aspx|work=CommonWealth magazine|issue=Fall 2011/American Dream Special Issue|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==

===“Transitions: Career and Family Life Cycles of the Educational Elite” (2008)===
Goldin co-authored this article with Lawrence F. Katz. Goldin and Katz look into the transition of women getting married and bearing children at an older age, while becoming more educated and entering the workforce. Beginning in the 1970s, a surge of women began pursuing careers and foregoing getting married and having children in their early 20s. The median age at first marriage among college graduate women, which had been stable at about 22.5 years old from the 1950s to the early 1970s (for birth cohorts from the 1930s to about 1950), increased by 2.5 years between 1972 and 1979 (for birth cohorts from about 1950 to 1955). The fraction of women not having a first birth by around 40 years old increased from 20 percent for those graduating in the early 1960s, to 28 percent for those graduating in the 1970s. College graduate women greatly increased their education in professional schools; the fraction female among first-year law and medical school students, for example, was 10 percent in 1970 but rose to 40 percent by 1990. Goldin provides a detailed account of women at Harvard University in the years 1970, 1980, and 1990 within the study. It showed a great increase in the percentage of female students, and a significant decrease in the percentage of female students who were married two years after receiving their degree. Though more female students entered the University, and they did not get married right away, the percentage of the female graduates who work full-time, full year from the 1990 class is 1.7 percent lower than those from 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/lkatz/files/transitions_career_and_family_lifecycles_of_the_educational_elite.pdf|title=Transitions: Career and Family Life Cycles of the Educational Elite|last=Goldin|first=Claudia|date=2008|website=Harvard University|publisher=American Economic Review|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women's Employment, Education, and Family" (2006)===

The Quiet Revolution (1970s–present) was preceded by what Goldin labeled as three evolutionary phases: “Independent Female Worker” (late-19th century – 1920s), “Easing the Constraints on Married Women in the Labor Force” (1930s–1950), and “Roots of the Revolution” (1950s–1970s), respectively. In the first phase, the female workers were usually young and single, working in manufacturing or as domestics and laundresses. These women had little learning on the job and the majority of women were not well educated. Moving into the second phase, the labor factor productivity for married women increased by 15.5% because of an increased demand for office workers and the participation of women in the "[[high school movement]]". By the third phase, the female labor supply had become more [[Elasticity (economics)|elastic]] and more responsive to changes in wages. In this period, most women were secondary earners and worked in "[[Pink-collar worker|pink-collar]]" jobs as secretaries, teachers, nurses, social workers, and librarians. Even though higher education was possible, most women did not establish careers, and went to college to meet their spouses rather than to further their education. Goldin argues that the transformation in female labor force participation is due to changes in factors such as female horizons, identities, and average marrying age.&lt;ref name=quiet&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Claudia Goldin|title=The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women’s Employment, Education, and Family|journal=[[American Economic Review]]|date=2006|volume=96|issue=2|pages=1–21|doi=10.1257/000282806777212350|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282806777212350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Goldin's article, the term "horizon" refers to how a woman perceives her lifetime labor force involvement at the time of human capital investment, and whether her involvement will be long-term or short-term. Identity refers to the individuality a woman finds in her job, occupation, or career. Lastly, decision-making entails whether a woman makes labor force decisions jointly if she is married or in a long-term relationship, or whether she takes a secondary position where time is allocated by her spouse's labor involvement decisions. What set the "Quiet Revolution" aside from the three evolutionary periods was that the revolution was a change marked from static decision-making to one of [[dynamic decision making]].

According to Goldin, a key cause of the Quiet Revolution was the development of new contraceptive technology, namely the [[birth control]] pill. Young women married and had children at a lower rate if the state they lived in had early legal access to it; women could set aside their relationships and pursue a career through higher education. Goldin and Katz noted that the birth control pill was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1960 for use by married women. It spread to young, unmarried women in the late 1960s with change in [[age of majority]] laws. Thus, they found a difference from the national average for women born 1930–1965 with if they lived in a state with early legal access to the pill. There was a −0.02 difference in marriage age at 23 from the national average of 0.41. There was a −0.07 difference from the national average of having a child by 22. There was a 0.004 difference from the national average of being a professional, and a 0.016 difference from the national average of being a lawyer or doctor. The birth control pill affected marriage, fertility, and career choice.

==="Decreasing (and then Increasing) Inequality in America: A Tale of Two Half-Centuries" (2001)===

Goldin co-authored this article with [[Lawrence F. Katz]]. In the article, Goldin and Katz divide the 20th century in the United States into two periods. The second half of the 20th century is considered a period of widening inequality, while the first half is a period of narrowing inequality. They examine, among other things, the “Great Compression” of wages in the 1940s and education reforms such as the [[high school movement]] in the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Decreasing (and then Increasing) Inequality in America: A Tale of Two Half-Centuries|chapterurl= http://scholar.harvard.edu/goldin/files/decreasing_and_then_increasing.pdf|editor1-last=Welch|editor1-first=Finis|title=The Causes and Consequences of Increasing Inequality|date=2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=9780226893013|pages=37–82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wUravsiZ4cC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Human Capital Century and American Leadership: Virtues of the Past" (2001)===

In the 20th century human capital investment became generally regarded by industrialized nations as being more important than technology and physical capital investment. This article queries the reasons the United States invested in human capital through post-elementary education to a far greater extent than other wealthy nations at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Claudia Goldin|title=The Human Capital Century and American Leadership: Virtues of the Past|journal=Journal of Economic History|date=June 2001|volume=61|issue=2|pages=263–292|doi=10.1017/S0022050701028017|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/goldin/publications/human-capital-century-and-american-leadership-virtues-past}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Human Capital Century" examines the ways that post-elementary education in the United States during the 20th century was advanced, and argues that the principal reasons for U.S. education advancement were an ethic of [[egalitarianism]] (as opposed to elite educational systems in many European countries) and initial factor endowments which led to liberal education instead of vocational education, a high level of return on post-elementary education, geographic mobility, and a decentralized educational system.

Virtues contributing to the American educational template included public funding, openness, local control, [[gender neutrality]], [[separation of church and state]], and an academic curriculum. The resulting “high school movement” incorporating these virtues produced a larger group of educated workers, enabled social and geographical mobility, and contributed to potential economic growth. In contrast, Europe’s educational template was determined by a centralized government and remained less open in the 1950s, focusing on providing technical training programs in the form of work-study arrangements for older teenagers.

Goldin states that many of the virtues characterizing the American educational system in the earlier part of the twentieth century may now be considered vices of the present. Through the open and forgiving system that once created social and geographic mobility, now appears a lack of strict standards. High enrollment rates for high schools as evidence for America’s open educational system do not necessarily imply high-quality education. Furthermore, through the decentralized system in which local districts that compete for residents participate in educational investments that once fostered growth of schools may now lead to large differences in funding. Finally, the public funding that once allowed anyone to join and everyone to be on equal footing now presents discrepancies due to poor and rich towns.

===''The Race Between Education and Technology'' (2008)===
Co-authored with [[Lawrence F. Katz]], Goldin explores the United States' economic slowdown in the late 1970s. They argue that it was rising [[Income inequality in the United States|economic inequality]] at the end of the 20th century, not slow productivity growth nor [[Convergence (economics)|economic convergence]] between nations, that was at the root of the United States' economic trouble.&lt;ref name="hup"&gt;Harvard University Press.

[[Community organizing]] describes a wide variety of efforts to empower residents in a local area to participate in civic life or governmental affairs. Most efforts that claim this label operate in low-income or middle-income areas, and have adopted at least some of the tactics and organizing techniques pioneered by [[Saul Alinsky]] and his [[Industrial Areas Foundation]].  Other organizations in this tradition include [[PICO National Network]], [[Gamaliel Foundation]], and [[Direct Action and Research Training Center]] (DART).

They focus on building political power in the hands of an organization of local residents, and using that power to influence issues the organization defines as important. '''Congregation-based Community Organizing''' (CBCO) works through local [[synagogues]], [[church (building)|churches]], and [[mosques]] as the primary institutional sponsors of this work. Common characteristics:

*'''Faith-based:''' They ground their organizing in the moral values and traditions that stem from religious faith, to varying degrees and often quite powerfully. See [[religion and peacebuilding]].
*'''Broad-based:''' They are typically [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] or [[interfaith dialogue|interfaith]], and many include schools, unions, or a variety of other community-based institutions like neighborhood associations.
*'''Locally constituted:''' They organize in areas that range from large neighborhoods to entire cities. Although linked into the national and regional networks discussed above, they emphasize local grassroots organizing.
*'''Multi-issue:''' Their purpose is to instruct local congregational authorities about how to effectively address a variety of pressing issues facing their communities.
*'''Professionally staffed:''' CBCO groups hire professionals to recruit and train leaders to work with their religious communities on a personal and regular basis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5983">The '''Conservatorio Nacional Superior de Música''' is the [[music school|national music conservatory]] for Argentina and it is located in [[Buenos Aires]].

==History==
Ernesto de la Guardia, a member of the Wagnerian Society of Buenos Aires, first proposed the creation of a national conservatory. He gained support from the [[president of Argentina|president]] [[Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear]] and his wife [[Regina Pacini]] a noted [[soprano]],&lt;ref name="García"&gt;{{cite web|last1=García Cánepa|first1=Julio César|title=Institucional Historia|url=http://artesmusicales.org/web/index.php/institucional/historia.html|website=artesmusicales.org|publisher=Departamento de Artes Musicales y Sonoras “Carlos López Buchardo”|accessdate=4 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201224531/http://artesmusicales.org/web/index.php/institucional/historia.html|archivedate=1 December 2016|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|language=Spanish|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Conservatorio Nacional de Música y Declamación'' (National Conservatory of Music and Recitation) was founded by Argentine musician [[Carlos López Buchardo]], among others, on July 7, 1924. Based upon the School of Lyric and Scenic Art held at the [[Teatro Colón]] in [[Buenos Aires]], the conservatory focused on both lyric and theatrical studies, providing instruction in composition, vocal and instrument music, recitation and speech.&lt;ref name="Clasico" &gt;{{cite web|title=Conservatorio Nacional de Música y Declamación|url=http://www.musicaclasicaargentina.com/conservatorio.htm|website=Musica clasica Argentina|accessdate=4 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310024313/http://www.musicaclasicaargentina.com/conservatorio.htm|archivedate=10 March 2016|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|language=Spanish|date=2 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservatorio Nacional de Música y Declamación: Reglamento Interno|url=http://www.bnm.me.gov.ar/giga1/documentos/EL003810.pdf|website=Biblioteca Nacional Mariano Moreno|publisher=Ministry of Culture and Education|accessdate=4 July 2017|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|pages=5–8|language=Spanish|date=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlos López Buchardo]] became the first director and the first assistant director was {{ill|Enrique García Velloso|es}}. The conservatory began its operations at the Teatro Colón.&lt;ref name="García" /&gt; Within a few years, in 1930 the Conservatory relocated to the upper floors of the [[Teatro Nacional Cervantes]]. In 1928, renowned Russian prima ballerina, [[Elena Smirnova]] was hired as the first professor of dance of the Conservatory.&lt;ref name="Destaville" &gt;{{cite web|last1=Destaville|first1=Enrique Honorio|title=Elena Alexandrovna Smirnova|url=http://www.ciudaddeladanza.com/bibliodanza/articulos-y-noticias/elena-alexandrovna-smirnova.html|website=Ciudad de la Danza|accessdate=3 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229151030/http://www.ciudaddeladanza.com/bibliodanza/articulos-y-noticias/elena-alexandrovna-smirnova.html|archivedate=29 December 2016|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|language=Spanish|date=2013|postscript=. Self-published but with citations to source materials.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the name was changed to the Conservatorio Nacional de Música y Arte Escénico (National Conservatory of Music and Performing Arts) and it was renamed again upon the death of Buchardo at the end of 1948. The conservatory was renamed to honor its first director, and has since been known as the '''Conservatorio Nacional de "Carlos López Buchardo"'''.&lt;ref name="Clasico" /&gt; In 1950, the Dance Department was split from the organization with the founding of the National School of Dance ({{lang-es|Escuela Nacional de Danzas}}) and then between 1957 and 1958, the Theater Arts Department was separated from the Conservatory to create the National School of Theater ({{lang-es|Escuela Nacional de Teatro}}). Moving several times in the 1940s, by 1982, the Conservatory established its current location (2017) in the Palacio Rocca Avenida Córdoba 2445.&lt;ref name="García" /&gt;

==Modern organization==
The National Conservatoire was divided in 1989 into the present and independent ''Escuela Nacional de Música'' (basic and first levels) and the '''Conservatorio Nacional Superior de Música''' (middle and high levels).

In 1995, the middle level of the National Conservatorium is assigned to the government of the city of Buenos Aires, which is in 1998 named ''Conservatorio de Música de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10140">'''Contemplative education''' is a philosophy of [[higher education]] that integrates introspection and experiential learning into academic study in order to support academic and social engagement, develop self-understanding as well as analytical and critical capacities, and cultivate skills for engaging constructively with others.

The inclusion of contemplative and introspective practices in academia addresses an increasingly recognized imbalance in higher education: a lack of support for developing purpose and meaning, or for helping students "learn who they are, search for larger purpose for their lives, and leave college as better human beings".&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{

== Philosophy ==

Informed by the many forms of contemplative practice in philosophies and religions the world over, contemplative education invites students to embrace the immediacy of their interior lives as a means for applying their own first-person experiences to what they are learning in their classrooms.&lt;ref name="openingcontmind"&gt;{{

|title=Opening the Contemplative Mind in the Classroom
|date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemplative practices invite close observation of phenomena (e.g., natural processes, cultural productions, mental and emotional states, biases). These practices provide opportunities to develop attention and focus, increase awareness and understanding, listen and speak across difference, support creative approaches to problem solving, and consider the impacts of our actions on the world at large.&lt;ref name="problemsolving"&gt;{{

Contemplative education is not solely traditional education with, for example, a course in meditation thrown in; it is an approach that offers an entirely new way of understanding what it means to be educated in the modern Western liberal arts tradition. For example, to deepen their academic study, students might engage in [[mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] practices in order to cultivate being present-moment awareness, or engage in dialogue and deep listening practices in order to develop interpersonal skills.

In the past two decades contemplative practices have become growingly incorporated across curricular settings. It is very difficult to provide exact numbers, however, recent reviews have clearly depicted this as a historical change in which primary, secondary and higher public (not only alternative) educational institutions are becoming far more receptive to these practices.&lt;ref&gt; Oren Ergas (2018) A contemplative turn in education: Charting a curricular-pedagogical countermovement. Pedagogy, Culture &amp; Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of contemplative education has been present in the United States since at least 1974,&lt;ref name="naropahist"&gt;{{

|url=http://www.naropa.edu/history.html
|publisher=Naropa University
|title=History

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has gained popularity particularly recently as contemplative practices (such as mindfulness and yoga) have sparked the interest of educators at all levels. It has inspired networks of higher-education professionals for the advancement of contemplative education, primarily the Association for Contemplative Mind in Higher Education (ACMHE), which has an international membership of over 750 faculty, administrators, and higher education professionals. The ACMHE was founded in 2008 by the [[Center for Contemplative Mind in Society]] and has convened annual conferences on contemplative education since 2009.&lt;ref name="acmhe"&gt;{{

|title=The Association for Contemplative Mind in Higher Education

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of the ACMHE was precipitated by the Contemplative Practice Fellowships, a program administered by the Center for Contemplative Mind in Society from 1997 through 2009. Fellowships were awarded to 153 faculty members at 107 colleges and universities for designing and teaching courses which included contemplative methods. This initiative helped to form a community of practice on the use of contemplative methods across higher education disciplines.&lt;ref name="fellowships"&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While contemplative education aims to integrate contemplative practices and perspectives within any subject of study, the discipline of contemplative studies—the examination of the contemplative experience itself—has also developed. The Contemplative Studies Initiative at [[Brown University]], founded by [[Harold D. Roth|Harold Roth]], Professor of Religious Studies and Director of the Contemplative Studies Initiative, offers a formal concentration in contemplative studies.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{

Contemplative education also fueled the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Jazz and Contemplative Studies curriculum at The [[University of Michigan]] School of Music, which combines meditation practice and related studies with [[jazz]] and overall musical training.&lt;ref name="sarath"&gt;{{

In Colorado, the Rocky Mountain Contemplative Higher Education Network (RMCHEN) launched in September 2006 with an event hosted by [[Naropa University]]. [[Peter Schneider (architecture professor)|Peter Schneider]], a renowned architecture professor at the [[University of Colorado-Boulder]] and [[Barbara Dilley]], a former president of Naropa and an accomplished dancer, choreographer and educator, spoke at the launch of RMCHEN.

Dr [[Han F. de Wit]], the author of "[[Contemplative psychology]]", outlined one of the first systematic works suggesting a framework in which a full-fledged contemplative psychology may be developed.&lt;ref name="Contemplative psychology"&gt;{{

&lt;blockquote&gt; "The point is not to abandon scholarship but to ground it, to personalize it and to balance it with the fundamentals of mind training, especially the practice of sitting meditation so that inner development and outer knowledge go hand in hand. . . . A balanced education cultivates abilities beyond the verbal and conceptual to include matters of heart, character, creativity, self-knowledge, concentration, openness and mental flexibility."

—Judy Lief, former [[Naropa University]] president
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Contemplative disciplines ===

Woven into the curriculum at Naropa, for example, are practices that include sitting [[meditation]], t’ai-chi ch’uan, [[aikido]], [[yoga]], Chinese brushstroke and [[ikebana]].

These are some of the most commonly referred-to contemplative practices, but there are many others, including other traditional arts, ritual practices and activist practices.&lt;ref name="whatarepractices"&gt;{{

'''Cosma Shiva Hagen''' (born May 17, 1981 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]) is a German-American actress and the daughter of the German [[New wave music|new wave]]/[[Punk rock|punk]] singer [[Nina Hagen]] and the Dutch musician Ferdinand Karmelk. Her grandmother is actress [[Eva-Maria Hagen]], and her step-grandfather is the East German dissident writer [[Wolf Biermann]]. [[Eva-Maria Hagen]] was allowed to emigrate to [[West Germany]] during the 1970s.  Shiva's unusual name was picked by her mother, who claimed she saw a [[UFO]] while pregnant. "Cosma" is a reference to [[Cosmos]], and "Shiva" is a reference to the [[Hindu]] God [[Shiva]].

Shiva is largely unknown outside of [[German language|German]]-speaking countries. Although she speaks [[English language|English]], her acting roles have been largely confined to German language films and television productions. She also starred in an Irish film called ''Short Order'' (2005).

Born in [[Los Angeles, California]], Shiva speaks German, English, [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. As a child, Cosma Shiva lived in [[London]], [[Berlin]], [[Paris]], [[Ibiza]], a boarding school in [[Lüneburg]] and her current home, [[Hamburg]].

'''Cowbellpedia Secondary Schools Mathematics TV Quiz Show''' is a Nigerian national mathematics television [[quiz show]] that debuted in 2015. It showcases young mathematical minds in Nigeria on cable TV [[Africa Magic]] Family channel 154.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/01/cowbellpedia-search-best-student-begins-2017-maths-quiz-opens/|title=COWBELLPEDIA : Search for best student begins as 2017 Maths quiz opens – Vanguard News|date=2017-01-19|work=Vanguard News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/01/impact-students-mathematics-20-years-cowbellpedia/|title=Our impact on students’ Mathematics for 20 years — Cowbellpedia – Vanguard News|date=2018-01-25|work=Vanguard News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This competition sees six students each representing their school compete in an episode where two qualifies and four of them are eliminated in two difficult rounds with three increasingly difficult levels. The winners of the competition in the two categories receives the award of the Next Future Inventor. 

A season of the show is made up of sixteen episodes in which there is a special episode dedicated to the teachers where the best teacher of the year emerges.

== History ==
The initiative began in 1998 as Cowbell National Secondary School Mathematics Competition (NASSMAC) when it was a written examination without a TV show. The name comes from a milk brand (Cowbell, Our Milk) that sponsors the competition.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnigerianjobs.com/hotjobs/80840/2016-cowbell-national-secondary-schools-mathematic.html|title=Cowbell National Secondary Schools Mathematics Competition 2016|first=|last=Hotnigerianjobs|website=Hot Nigerian Jobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://takenotenigeria.com/2015/07/21/list-winners-cowbell-national-secondary-schools-mathematics-competition/|title=Cowbell National Mathematics Competition- List of Winners for Junior and Senior Categories – Take Note Nigeria|date=21 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://punchng.com/winners-emerge-in-cowbellpedia-mathematics-competition/|title=Winners emerge in Cowbellpedia Mathematics Competition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the initiative took a new dimension where it’s split into two stages. The stage one is the Qualifying Written Examination and the Stage two is the TV quiz competition.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The top prize was increased to 2 million Nigerian Naira in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://guardian.ng/features/education/qualifying-exam-for-2018-cowbellpedia-mathematics-competition-holds-february-17/|title=Qualifying exam for 2018 Cowbellpedia Mathematics Competition holds February 17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Currambena School''' is an [[independent school|independent primary]] and [[preschool education|preschool]] in [[Lane Cove]], [[New South Wales]].

==History==

The school was established in 1969, when the then Woodley Preparatory School was purchased by the founders.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://currambena.nsw.edu.au/general-information/history/|title=History|date=2007|publisher=Currambena School|accessdate=2009-06-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914065424/http://currambena.nsw.edu.au/general-information/history/|archivedate=2009-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of a number of alternative schools that pioneered the application in Australia of the ideas of progressive educationalist [[A. S. Neill]].&lt;ref name="Andresen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andresen|first=Lee|author2=David Boud |author3=Ruth Cohen |title=Understanding Adult Education and Training|editor=Foley, G.|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Sydney|pages=225–239|chapter=Experienced Based Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school commenced with 116 students in January 1970: 72 in the preschool and 44 in the primary. The school expanded to include a second adjacent building in 1971.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In 2003 the school had 71 students;&lt;ref name="Est04"/&gt; in 2004 this had grown to 88 students&lt;ref name="Dick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://currambena.nsw.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/smh2004march13teachers-say-tests-will-take-fun-from-learning.pdf|title=Teachers say tests will take fun from learning|last=Dick|first=Tim|date=2004-03-13|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2009-06-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916040709/http://currambena.nsw.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/smh2004march13teachers-say-tests-will-take-fun-from-learning.pdf|archivedate=2009-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006 the school had 93 students.&lt;ref name="Binger"&gt;{{cite news|title=Parent power|last=Binger|first=Annette|date=2006-07-02|work=Sunday Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth government uses a measure of socio-economic status of independent schools to help determine their funding; Currambena has scored highly on this scale (meaning its students live in high socio-economic status locations).&lt;ref name="Est04"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/eet_ctte/estimates/add_0304/dest/e857_04a2.pdf|title=Answer to Question No. E857_04|last=Department of Education, Science and Training|date=February 2004|publisher=Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee|accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative school, Currambena experienced external pressures from increasing standardisation of curricula,&lt;ref name="Mortimer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alex.edfac.usyd.edu.au/archived%20conferences/ConferencePIC2001/AmyMortimerHonours.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040815205155/http://alex.edfac.usyd.edu.au/archived%20conferences/ConferencePIC2001/AmyMortimerHonours.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-08-15|title=Progressive education: The lived experiences of Currambena School 1969-2001|last=Mortimer|first=Amy|date=2001|work=Post Internship Conference 2001|publisher=University of Sydney Faculty of Education|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from reforms to student assessment.&lt;ref name="Dick"/&gt; Representatives of the school were prominent in criticising developments in education policy such as the introduction of national standardised tests.&lt;ref name="Binger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BillSub2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/eet_ctte/completed_inquiries/1999-02/stgrant2000/submissions/sublist.htm|title=Submission to the Inquiry into States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000|last=Currambena School Education Committee|date=October 2000|publisher=Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Committee|accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation and activities==
The school is administered by a council comprising six parents and three teachers; it has no school principal.&lt;ref name="Organisation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://currambena.nsw.edu.au/general-information/school-organisation/|title=School organisation|date=2007|publisher=Currambena School|accessdate=2009-06-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914065517/http://currambena.nsw.edu.au/general-information/school-organisation/|archivedate=2009-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board is democratic and responsible for curriculum, facilities and employment decisions.&lt;ref name="Binger"/&gt; The original articles of association stipulated a maximum class size of 25; this was subsequently reduced to 22,&lt;ref name="Denney"/&gt; with classes split into three age groups.&lt;ref name="Classes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://currambena.nsw.edu.au/class-pages/|title=Class composition|last=Currambena School|date=2007|publisher=Currambena School|accessdate=2009-07-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914062727/http://currambena.nsw.edu.au/class-pages/|archivedate=2009-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school emphasises creativity and flexibility in responding to the needs of individual children.&lt;ref name="Binger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denney"&gt;{{cite news|title=One-third of pupils go private|last=Denney|first=Margot|date=2001-02-13|work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;{{cite news|title=Schools take a star turn|last=Selinger-Morris|first=Samantha|date=2008-04-26|work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Graduation Pledge of Social and Environmental Responsibility''' has been offered since 1987 at [[college]]s and [[University|universities]] throughout the [[United States]] and the world. The Pledge states: ''I pledge to explore and take into account the social and environmental consequences of any job I consider and will try to improve these aspects of any organizations for which I work.'' The purpose of the Pledge is to encourage graduating students to be mindful of the social and environmental impacts of their [[employment]] as they enter the workforce or continue their [[education]]. It is up to students to define for themselves what socially and environmentally responsible means. Over one hundred Universities and colleges as well as some high schools use the pledge to some extent. There are several different types of schools involved, including the following:

* Liberal arts colleges such as [[Manchester University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.edu/common/graduation/gpa.htm |title=Graduation Pledge |website=Manchester.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juniata College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.juniata.edu/services/provost/commencement/pledge.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209233740/http://www.juniata.edu/services/provost/commencement/pledge.html |archivedate=2011-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhlenberg College]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/campuslife/sye/GPA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225221825/http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/campuslife/sye/GPA.html |archivedate=2011-12-25 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hartwick College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartwick.edu/about-us/centers-and-institutes/the-pine-lake-institute-for-environmental-and-sustainability-studies/sustainability-at-hartwick/graduation-pledge |title=Pine Lake Institute for Environmental &amp; Sustainability Studies - Hartwick College |website=Hartwick.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who voluntarily sign the pledge seek out employment that reflects their values, sometimes turning down jobs with which they do not feel comfortable. Others work to make changes after they are on the job. Some examples include promoting [[recycling]] at their workplace, removing discriminatory language from training materials, working for [[gender equality]] in athletics, and helping to convince employers to reject contracts that would clearly have negative impacts on society or the environment.

The Pledge was first established at [[Humboldt State University]], [[California]], in 1987. Manchester University in [[Indiana]] hosted the effort from 1996 to 2007, at which time [[Bentley University]] near [[Boston]] became the host. The project takes shape in different ways depending on the institution. At some colleges, for example, students sign wallet-sized cards with the Pledge written on them that they can keep as a reminder of the commitment they've made. Some institutions put the Pledge into the formal program for their Commencement ceremonies. At other institutions, pledge signers wear green ribbons or green tassels at Commencement to signify their commitment (some schools use a different color of ribbon). At Bentley University the pledge is a "capstone" of its four-year Civic Leadership Program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.bentley.edu/alliance/BCLP/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209232933/http://legacy.bentley.edu/alliance/BCLP/ |archivedate=2011-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at Humboldt State University, the student government funds a student Pledge coordinator internship.
The Pledge serves to promote social and environmental responsibility on three different levels: Students and alumni who are making choices about employment; schools including values and citizenship in their curriculum as opposed to just knowledge and skills; and the workplaces and wider society being concerned about issues beyond just the bottom line. The Graduation Pledge Alliance maintains a web site for campus organizers and those who have signed the Pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graduationpledge.org |title=Graduation Pledge Alliance &amp;#124; Social and Environmental Responsibility Works |website=Graduationpledge.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''jam2jam''' is a family of audiovisual software for collaborative performance. The systems use [[generative systems|generative]] algorithms for audio and visual material whose parameters are controlled by users with either  a graphical user interface or external hardware controllers. jam2jam software applications can connect over local networks or the internet allowing real-time collaboration. This type of functionality is referred to as Network Jamming and is the topic of ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;Network Jamming research is documented here: http://acid.net.au/index0b83.html?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=64&amp;Itemid=134&lt;/ref&gt;

The jam2jam software has been primarily employed to enable access to collaborative audiovisual performances, and is used in [[education]] and [[community arts]] settings.&lt;ref&gt;Educational and community arts uses of jam2jam are documented here: http://explodingart.com/jam2jam/jam2jam/Research/Research.html&lt;/ref&gt; The software has also found application in assisting people with [[disabilities]] to participate in playful arts activities.

The Network Jamming research that surrounds the use of jam2jam is built on a [[constructivist epistemology]] and encourages learning about audio and visual media through interactive performances and making by video recording the performances. The jam2jam software facilitates this philosophical approach by enabling collaboration through network connections and allows performances to be recorded for review and sharing. There are a number of academic publications describing this research.&lt;ref&gt;Academic articles on Network Jamming research using jam2jam: http://explodingart.com/jam2jam/jam2jam/Research/Entries/2007/8/11_Publications.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katherine McCoy''' (born Katherine Jane Braden in [[Decatur, Illinois]], October 12, 1945) is an American [[graphic designer]] and educator, best known for her work as the co-chair of the graduate Design program for [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]].

During her extensive career spanning education and professional practice, McCoy worked with groundbreaking design firm [[Unimark International|Unimark]], Chrysler Corporation, and with [[Muriel Cooper]] in the early days of [[MIT Press]] while at the Boston design firm  Omnigraphics.  McCoy's career in education was similarly broad, teaching at Cranbrook Academy of Art, Illinois Institute of Technology's [[IIT Institute of Design|Institute of Design]], and the [[Royal College of Art]], London. She is also the co-founder of High Ground, a workshop firm created for professional designers in their studios.

==Early career==

As a student, McCoy initially studied [[interior design]] at [[Michigan State University]] but switched to [[industrial design]], in which field she graduated in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45486311|title=Women designers in the USA, 1900-2000 : diversity and difference : Jacqueline M.

  | accessdate = 30 Jul 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly after graduation, McCoy joined [[Unimark International]], a design firm led by many key figures in [[American Modernist]] graphic design, including [[Massimo Vignelli]], Ralph Eckerstrom of Container Corporation, Jay Doblin and [[Herbert Bayer]]. It was at the interdisciplinary Unimark offices where McCoy was exposed to the strict [[International Typographic Style|Swiss]] typographic and design approaches which came to permeate much of American corporate communications through the late 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref name=harper&gt;{{cite book

  | location = San Francisco, CA
  | pages = 62–63
  | isbn = 0-8118-1680-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Unimark, McCoy worked for a year in the corporate identity offices of the Chrysler Corporation, then joined the Boston design firm Omnigraphics, where she worked on several projects for the MIT Press with [[Muriel Cooper]].&lt;ref name=wild /&gt; Next she joined Designers &amp; Partners, the Detroit advertising design studio where she met the designer - illustrator - cartoonist [[Edward Fella]]. Designers &amp; Partners focused solely on working with advertising agencies and had a staff that included a wide variety of graphic arts professionals, including illustrators, cartoonists, and "lettering men" as well as graphic designers. Although McCoy found that ad agency work was not very compatible with design thinking and ethics, the opportunities she was given and connections she made are an important part of her design experience.&lt;ref name="aiga.org"&gt;http://www.aiga.org/medalist-katherinemccoy/&lt;/ref&gt; She also worked with other professional practices including Xerox Education Group, and major advertising agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highgrounddesign.com/mccoy/kmframe.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 she founded the practice McCoy &amp; McCoy, Inc, with her husband, [[Michael McCoy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=Alissa|title=McCoy, Katherine|journal=Oxford Art Online|date=20 Oct 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in design education==

In Fall 1971 McCoy began her career in design education when she was appointed co-chair of the Cranbrook Academy of Art graduate design program with her husband [[Michael McCoy]].  While McCoy led the graphic design program, and [[Michael McCoy]] led the industrial design program, both 2D and 3D design students shared studios, and explored interdisciplinary approaches towards designing. Katherine describes combining the "objective" typographic approach that she knew through reading and the Unimark experience with an interest in the social and cultural activism that was in the air in the late '60s when creating and reinventing the program.&lt;ref name="aiga.org"/&gt; Early conceptual influences on the Cranbrook design approach were [[Robert Venturi|Robert Venturi's]] book ''Learning from Las Vegas'', [[Richard Saul Wurman]]'s publishing on the man-made environment, and McCoy's own interest in social design and design vernacular. The commercial vernacular collages of Edward Fella, the [[Schule für Gestaltung Basel|Basel]] experiments of [[Wolfgang Weingart]] and a Yale project by [[Dan Friedman (graphic designer)|Dan Friedman]] were visual design influences. Later sources included [[semiotics]], [[post-structuralism]], [[literary theory]] and [[deconstruction]]; both the students' and McCoy's work experimented with applications of these ideas to communications design. Katherine designed many projects for the Cranbrook Educational Community including quarterly magazines, art catalogs, Art Academy departmental posters and museum exhibitions that she and Michael produced as McCoy &amp; McCoy.

Reinvented by the McCoys, the program was organized around experimentation in the studio, with minimal structure or assignments – a return to the Art Academy's original method. There were no deadlines, papers, or finals, other than the expectation of new work in weekly critiques and semester-end self-evaluations and extended bibliographies. A final degree project and thesis were required in the last semester. The McCoys required students to read deeply about the history and theory behind the design concerns on which they were focusing. Each student was encouraged to develop their own design voice and vision, through a mix of studio experiments and client projects, sometimes on grant-funded projects with the McCoys. Students sometimes had the opportunity to work directly with Katherine McCoy, and this became the counterbalance for the experimental studio work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/medalist-katherinemccoy&lt;/ref&gt; The process that Katherine and Michael McCoy brought to the program initiated change in many aspects. It transformed the design program itself and the studios, along with its critiques, centered on the possibility of breaking from the norms of everyday design practice. Although the McCoy's program was sometimes thought to be controversial,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=47&amp;fid=56&lt;/ref&gt; their tenure at Cranbrook resulted in the graduation and success of many known designers, including [[Lorraine Wild]], [[Ed Fella|Edward Fella]], [[Nancy Skolos]] and Tom Wedell, [[P. Scott Makela]], [[Andrew Blauvelt]], Lucille Tenazas, Meredith Davis and Patrick Whitney. After McCoy left Cranbrook in 1995, she held several other teaching positions. Her most well-known position with the Illinois Institute of Technology's Institute of Design, from 1995–2003, and the Royal College of Art in London.

In the 1970s, Katherine McCoy took two major leaps to advance the program, in terms of student work. First, she began to change the introductory typography projects to allow students a new semiotic interpretation. This allowed students to begin to drive to the solutions and to depart from the strict Modernist vocabulary used in the program in previous years. Included are stylistic elements that had previously been underused by Modernist typographers, such as historical or vernacular type forms or images. The second leap was to allow the more advanced and able students to take lead on the exploration of theory.

In 1991, Katherine and Michael McCoy, along with a team 2-D students, produced the book "Cranbrook Design: The New Discourse" (Rizzoli International Publications). The book documented the work that produced in the Cranbrook studios during the 1980s, and it "probably sealed the reputation of the school" &lt;ref name="aiga.org"/&gt; as a place where the visual qualities of the work, sometimes generated by a highly creative interpretation of theory, took precedence without regard to the "needs of the profession".&lt;ref name="aiga.org"/&gt; The critiques of the work represented in the book were often voiced without knowledge of the actual discourse of the studio critique. Led by the McCoys, experimentation was challenged to be as real as possible.

After 24 years of creative work, the McCoys left their positions in 1995.  They moved to Chicago where they spent each fall semester at the Illinois Institute of Technology's Institute of Design, giving senior lectures and seminars until 2004.&lt;ref name="a-g-i.org"&gt;http://www.a-g-i.org/2053/members/mccoy.html&lt;/ref&gt; There Katherine focused on theoretical and methodological issues, particularly on audience-centered communications, and the teaching and practice of graphic design within the context of new media.

==Later career==

McCoy now consults in communications design, design curriculum planning at [[Kansas City Art Institute]] and post-professional design education as a partner of McCoy &amp; McCoy, and High Ground Tools and Strategies for Design.&lt;ref&gt;http://powerofdesign.aiga.org/content.cfm/mccoy_categ&lt;/ref&gt; High Ground Design is a series of workshops created by Katherine and her husband, [[Michael McCoy]] for other professional designers to work in their studio. High Ground is dedicated to expanding design skills and methods, as well as opening up to the vision of design, questioning assumptions and redefining the nature of design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highgrounddesign.com/about/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawrence W. Sherman''' (born October 25, 1949) is an American experimental criminologist and police educator who is the founder of [[evidence-based policing]].

Sherman's use of randomized controlled [[experiment]]s to study [[Deterrence (psychological)|deterrence]] and [[crime prevention]] has led him to examine such wide-ranging issues as [[domestic violence]], [[saturation patrol]], [[gun violence]], [[crack houses]], and [[reintegrative shaming]]. He has collaborated with over 30 police and justice agencies around the world, and been credited as a key founder of the field of [[experimental criminology]].

Sherman holds the posts of Director of the Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/research/experiments/ Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology]&lt;/ref&gt;and [[Wolfson Professor of Criminology]] Emeritus at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he is also Chair of the Cambridge Police Executive Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/courses/police/ Cambridge Police Executive Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;. He is also a Distinguished University Professor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice in College Park, the Director of the Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing&lt;ref&gt;[http://cambridge-ebp.net Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing]&lt;/ref&gt;, and Editor-in-Chief of the Centre's Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/journal/41887 Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing]&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Education==
Sherman graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Denison University]] in 1970, with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Political Science]]. He received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[social science]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1970, earned a [[Diploma]] in [[Criminology]] from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1973, and received his M.A. and [[Ph.D.]]in [[sociology]] from [[Yale University]] in 1974 and 1976 respectively.

==Academic career==
Sherman's career began at age 20 in the New York City Mayor's Office and Police Department as an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation [https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/celebratin-40-years-of-urban-fellows/'s New York City Urban Fellow]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and aide to the NYPD's Police Commissioner [[Patrick V. Murphy]], where he began a long research partnership with NYPD Assistant Chief [[Tony Bouza]]. Bouza became the Minneapolis Police Chief in 1980, where he persuaded the City Council to approve Sherman's research design to randomly assign arrest for misdemeanor [[domestic violence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix/individuals/individuals-sherman-and-berk-1984/}}&lt;/ref&gt; later known as the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]]. Sherman's early experimental research into the influence of arrest on recidivism in spouse abuse led to changes in police department policies and procedures nationwide, encouraged state legislatures to modify state statutes to allow for [[misdemeanor]] arrest, and eventually resulted in five federally funded replications, one of which Sherman led in Milwaukee. In the late 1980s, Sherman's discovery of hot spots of crime &lt;ref&gt;New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/nyregion/police-have-done-more-than-prisons-to-cut-crime-in-new-york.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0)&lt;/ref&gt; led to his experimental research with [[David Weisburd]] and [[Tony Bouza]] that was first to show clear crime prevention effects of directed police patrol in high crime locations. In the early 1990s, Sherman's Kansas City Gun Experiment studied the effect of concentrated police patrol on gun crime and violence and that directed police patrol in gun crime "hot spots" led to an increase in seizures of illegally carried guns and a decrease in gun crimes.

Since 1995, Sherman has been co directing a program of prospective longitudinal experiments in restorative justice involving approximately 2,500 offenders and 2,000 crime victims. He has also  worked on the development of new tools for predicting murder among offenders on probation and parole in [[Philadelphia]], as well as randomized trials of intensive services among highest risk offenders.

From 1999 to 2007, Sherman was Greenfield Professor of Human Relations at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], initially in the Department of Sociology. Under his leadership, Penn became the first [[Ivy League|Ivy League University]] to establish a Ph.D. in criminology as a separate field in 2000, and the first to establish a separate department of criminology in 2003, when Sherman was appointed the University's first Professor of Criminology. He served as Chair of the University's Department of Criminology from 2003 to 2007 and as the Director of the [[Fels Institute of Government]] from 1999 to 2005. He resigned from Penn in June 2010 to return to the University of Maryland as Distinguished Unoversity Professor while jointly serving as Wolfson Professor of Criminology from 2007-2017. Since 2016, he has also served as an Honorary Professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane.

Sherman also served Maryland as Chair of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice from 1995 to 1999, and as a faculty member from 1982 to 1999. In 1987, he was the Seth Boyden Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Rutgers University]]'s Graduate School of Criminal Justice and from 1994 to 2016 he served as Adjunct Professor of Law at the [[Australian National University]]'s Research School of Social Science and later in the ANU School of Global Governance (RegNet). From 1976 to 1980 he was on the faculty of the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]]'s School of Criminal Justice.

From 2001 to 2007 he was the co-director of the Justice Research Consortium in the United Kingdom. Since 1995 has been the Scientific Director of RISE, an ongoing research program in partnership with [[Australian National University]] and the [[Australian Federal Police]]. From 1985 to 1995 he served as president of the Crime Control Institute, and from 1979 to 1985 he was the Director of Research and later Vice President for the Washington-D.C.-based [[Police Foundation]].

In addition to his experimental research, Sherman has published articles and book chapters on a wide variety of topics, including [[police corruption]], police education, police [[discretion]], police crackdowns, [[restorative justice]], investigations, police [[use of force]], and fear reduction. In 1997, Sherman led a team of [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] criminologists in producing Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesn’t, What's Promising, a Congressionally mandated evaluation of over 500 state and local crime prevention programs.

==Key research findings==
His major discoveries can be summarized as follows:

* In 1980, he discovered that restricting police powers to shoot people was not followed by any increases in crime, or in violence against police officers;&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, L. W.  (1983). 'Reducing Police Gun Use:  Critical Events, Administrative Policy and Organizational Change', in Punch, M. (ed.) ''Control in the Police Organization'',  Cambridge, Massachusetts:  M.I.T. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; this evidence was later cited by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in its 1985 [[Tennessee v. Garner]] decision to restrict police powers to kill across the US.
* In 1984, the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]] found that arresting suspects in [[domestic violence]] cases was more effective at reducing [[Recidivism|re-offending]] than counselling or temporarily separating the suspect and victim.&lt;ref name="sherman1984-pf"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/minneapolisdve.pdf |title=The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment |date=April 1984 |author1=Sherman, Lawrence W. |author2=Richard A. Berk |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Police Foundation |accessdate=2007-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705011333/http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/minneapolisdve.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1987, he discovered that over half of all reported crime and disorder occurred at just 3% of the property addresses in a major city, a finding that has since been consistently replicated in other cities. He showed that exactly where and when crime will occur is far more predictable than anyone had previously thought, thus laying the theoretical and empirical basis for what is now called "hot spots policing," now widely practiced from New York to Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman L. W. (l987) 'Repeat Calls To Police In Minneapolis'. ''Crime Control Reports 4''.  Washington, D.C.: Crime Control Institute, 18 pp. Reprinted in Kenney, D. (ed.) ''Police and Policing'', New York: Praeger, 1989. Reported in New York ''Times'' on February 23, 1987 at https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/24/us/minneapolis-study-places-origins-of-911-calls.html; Sherman, L., Gartin, P., &amp; Buerger, M. (1989). 'Hot spots of predatory crime: Routine activities and the criminology of place', ''Criminology'' vol. 27, pp.27-56.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1995, he discovered that homicides, shootings and other gun crimes could be reduced by intensified but lawful use of police stop and search powers in hot spots of gun crime,&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, L. W. and Rogan, D. P. (1995) 'Effects of Gun Seizures on Gun Violence: Hot Spot Patrols in Kansas City' ''Justice Quarterly'', vol. 12, no. 4., pp. 673-694.&lt;/ref&gt; a finding that has now been replicated in six out of six independent re-tests by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koper | first1 = C. | last2 = Mayo-Wilson | first2 = E. | year = 2006 | title = Police crackdowns on illegal gun carrying: a systematic review of their impact on gun crime | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Criminology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 227–261 | doi=10.1007/s11292-006-9005-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research helped prompt a major change in police practice in the US that was followed by a substantial reduction in the US homicide rate.&lt;ref&gt;Zimring, F. E. (2011) ''The city that became safe: New York's lessons for urban crime and its control'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1992, he discovered that arrest has contradictory effects on different kinds of domestic violence offenders, causing less violence among employed men but doubling the frequency of violence among men without jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sherman | first1 = L | year = 1992 | title = ''Policing Domestic Violence: Experiments and Dilemmas''|location =New York|publisher= Free Press.}} This finding has also been replicated by independent scientists in {{cite journal |last1=Pate|first1= A.

G. (2009) ''Violent partners: A breakthrough plan for ending the cycle of abuse'', NY: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1995, with his colleague [[David Weisburd]], he demonstrated that doubling or tripling the frequency of police patrols in crime hot spots could reduce street crime by two-thirds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherman | first1 = L. W. | last2 = Weisburd | first2 = D. | year = 1995 | title = General deterrent effects of police patrol in crime "hot spots": A randomized, controlled trial. | url = | journal = Justice Quarterly | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 625–648 | doi=10.1080/07418829500096221}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery has been replicated by other scholars as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braga | first1 = A.

* In 2000, with his colleague Heather Strang (to whom he was married in 2010), he discovered that restorative justice conferences between violent offenders and their victims could reduce repeat offending by half.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, L. W., Strang, H. and Woods, D. J. (2000) 'Recidivism Patterns in the Canberra Reintegrative Shaming Experiments (RISE)'. Canberra: Centre for Restorative Justice, Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University. http://www.aic.gov.au/criminal_justice_system/rjustice/rise/recidivism.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, with his colleagues Strang, Barnes and Woods, he showed that [[restorative justice]] also caused a 400% increase in criminal offending among [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginals]]. He concluded that while restorative justice had been shown in most other places to be effective, it could backfire in some places.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, L., Strang, H., Barnes, G. and Woods, D. (2006) 'Race and Restorative Justice: Aboriginals &amp; Whites in Canberra'. Paper Presented to the American Society of Criminology, Los Angeles, CA. November. See also Strang, H. and Lawrence Sherman, L., (2015) 'The Morality of Evidence: The Second Restorative Justice Lecture', ''Restorative Justice 2''. University of Leuven.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, Sherman discovered with Strang that nine ten out of ten of the restorative justice experiments they designed with victims present substantially reduced the overall two-year frequency of repeat convictions or arrests, across a wide range of offence types, offenders, and points in the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherman | first1 = L. | last2 = Strang | first2 = H. | last3 = Criminology Symposium | first3 = Stockholm | last4 = Stockholm | first4 = June | last5 = Sherman | first5 = L.

* In 2009, with Richard A. Berk and others, he discovered that a "data-mining" algorithm can predict which Philadelphia probationers are charged with murder or attempted murder 75 times more often than those the algorithm classifies as low-risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berk | first1 = R. | last2 = Sherman | first2 = L. | last3 = Barnes | first3 = G. | last4 = Kurtz | first4 = E. | last5 = Ahlman | first5 = L. | year = 2009 | title = 'Forecasting murder within a population of probationers and parolees: a high stakes application of statistical learning' | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A | volume = 172 | issue = | pages = 191–211 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-985x.2008.00556.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, he first published his proposal for a "[[crime harm index]]" to weight any count of crimes by individuals, groups, cities and countries by the number of days in prison prescribed for each offence type by sentencing guidelines, irrespective of whether anyone is charged or convicted of each reported offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherman | first1 = L | year = 2011 | title = 'Al Capone, the Sword of Damocles, and the Police–Corrections Budget Ratio' | url = | journal = Criminology &amp; Public Policy | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 195–206 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-9133.2010.00700.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2013, he developed the "Triple-T" framework for applying his 1998 model of evidence-based policing, showing how police decision-making could integrate systematic evidence on targeting, testing and tracking the use of police resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherman | first1 = L. W. | year = 2013 | title = 'The Rise of Evidence-Based Policing: Targeting, Testing and Tracking' | url = | journal = Crime and Justice | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 377–451 | doi=10.1086/670819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, L. W. (1998) ''Evidence-Based Policing''. Washington, DC: Police Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014, he discovered with Heather Harris that the long-term effect of arresting domestic abusers on their victims was to increase the victims’ death rate from all natural causes, but not homicide, compared to police warning the offender at the scene, with a doubling in mortality among African-American abuse victims from 5% to 10% over 23 years.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, L. W. and Harris., H. M. (2014) 'Increased death rates of domestic violence victims from arresting vs. warning suspects in the Milwaukee Domestic Violence Experiment (MilDVE).' ''Journal of Experimental Criminology'', pp.1-20. (Published online, 14 May 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, he published with Peter and Eleanor Neyroud the details of the [[Crime harm index|Cambridge Crime Harm Index]],&lt;ref&gt;http://policing.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/03/09/police.paw003&lt;/ref&gt; a system for measuring multiple crimes in areas or by individuals with the total amount of days imprisonment the crime could attract. The Index has since been used in various forms by police agencies in the UK, US, Sweden, Australia, and Uruguay. The paper and the concept won an award from [http://www.research-strategy.admin.cam.ac.uk/impact/vice-chancellors-awards Cambridge University's Vice Chancellor].

Research on the prestige of scholars in criminology and criminal justice has listed Sherman as one of the most highly cited scholars in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohn | first1 = E. G. | last2 = Farrington | first2 = D. P. | year = 1999 | title = 'Changes in the most-cited scholars in twenty criminology and criminal justice journals between 1990 and 1995' | url = | journal = Journal of Criminal Justice | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 345–359 | doi=10.1016/s0047-2352(99)00006-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence-based policing==

In a 1998 [[Police Foundation]] lecture, Sherman sketched out the concept of "[[evidence-based policing]]," modeled on the ideas of evidence-based medicine. His core idea was that police practice can be made far more effective if all of its complex but repeated elements were tested by repeated controlled field experiments. In February 2000, Sherman co-founded the [[Campbell collaboration]]'s Crime and Justice Group, which has pursued the synthesis of research evidence on the effectiveness of policing and other crime prevention practices. Since then, the [[FBI Academy]] has offered a course on [[evidence-based policing]], and it has become the subject of wide debate and commentary in police practice and research journals.

In 2008, Sherman made evidence-based policing (EBP) the core of the Police Executive Programme at Cambridge University, a part-time course of study for senior police leaders from around the world to earn a Diploma or Master's in applied criminology. In that year, the [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] (NPIA) funded the first international conference on EBP, which was attended by police executives from Asia, Australia, Europe and the US. Since then the conference has been held each July, with the 5th International Conference attended by over 250 police and scholars from six continents, including Africa and Latin America.

In 2010, a group of UK police officers founded the [http://www.sebp.police.uk Society of Evidence-Based Policing], and elected Sherman its first Honorary President, along with [[Peter Fahy|Sir Peter Fahy]], [[Chief Constable]] of the UK's [[Greater Manchester Police]] (see http://sebp.police.uk/index.php); as of 2014 the Society has over 1,000 members, primarily UK police officers but with membership from Australia to Argentina and North America. In 2013, police in collaboration with the University of Queensland established the Australian-New Zealand Society of Evidence-Based Policing, which now has over 500 members (see http://www.anzsebp.com/index.php). In 2015, both Canada (see https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072800/http://www.can-sebp.net/index.php) and the United States (see http://www.evidencebasedpolicing.org/index.php) established their own branches of this learned professional society. In 2013, UK [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] appointed Sherman an independent non-executive director of the new [[College of Policing]], which develops and promotes evidence of what works in policing.

==Institution building==

Sherman has been a prime mover in the development on several permanent new additions to the institutional landscape of criminology. The most visible of these new institutions is the [[Stockholm Prize in Criminology]], which philanthropist [[Jerry Lee]] and Sherman proposed to Professor [[Jerzy Sarnecki]] of [[Stockholm University]] in mid-2000, and which Sarnecki brought to the Swedish Ministry of Justice where it received support from successive Ministers. The annual Prize for criminological research or its application that benefits humanity was funded by the [[Jerry Lee]] Foundation for a guaranteed minimum of ten years, with the first prizes awarded in 2006. The Prize has been awarded annually since then, most often presented by a member of the Royal Family, with Sherman and Sarnecki as co-chairs of the International Jury that selects the winners. In 2012, Justice Minister Beatrice Ask concluded an agreement with the Soderberg foundations to provide joint funding with Ministry investment of a permanent endowment for a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20120712062254/http://www.criminologyprize.com/extra/pod/ Stockholm Prize Foundation], which guarantees annual funding of the Prize in perpetuity.

Sherman has also founded or helped to found the Academy of Experimental Criminology (in 1999), the Division of Experimental Criminology of the [[American Society of Criminology]] (in 2009), the [[Campbell Collaboration]] and its Crime and Justice Group (in 2000), the first Department of Criminology in the [[Ivy League]]—at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (in 2003) and its [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] and [[Master's degree|MA]] degrees (in 2001), its [[Master of Science]] (2004), and its Jerry Lee Center of Criminology (in 2001).

The website was shut down in 2013 following closure of the company's Toronto headquarters. The site offered test preparation tools, a university program directory, student counselling and a career network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Hindustan Times | title= Learnhub.com dons a new look |url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/Learnhub-com-dons-a-new-look-launches-Learnhub-2-0/Article1-540562.aspx| date= May 7, 2010| accessdate= June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, LearnHub became the 30th most visited website in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Quantcast| url=http://www.quantcast.com/| accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011 Learnhub was 13th most visited site in India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantcast|url=http://www.quantcast.com/learnhub.com | accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most popular education website in India. This success was highly cyclical and was a result of the traffic spikes in May/June when Indian students were using the vast free test prep database housed on the site. As of December 2012, LearnHub closed its Toronto office and stopped updating its website, Twitter and Facebook pages, suggesting that the company was no longer operating. In April 2013, [[Top Hat Monocle]] announced that LearnHub co-founder and former CEO Malgosia Green became the company's new Chief Product Officer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techvibes.com/blog/top-hat-monocle-adds-two-new-executives-ralf-riekers-and-malgosia-green-2013-04-18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leitner system alternative.svg|thumb|In the Leitner system, correctly answered cards are advanced to the next, less frequent box, while incorrectly answered cards return to the first box.]]
[[File:Leitner system.svg|thumb|An alternative method where incorrect answers are only moved back by one box]]
The '''Leitner system''' is a widely used method of efficiently using [[flashcard]]s that was proposed by the German science journalist [[Sebastian Leitner]] in the 1970s. It is a simple implementation of the principle of [[spaced repetition]], where cards are reviewed at increasing intervals.

== Method ==
In this method flashcards are [[sorting|sorted]] into groups according to how well the learner knows each one in the Leitner's learning box. The learners try to recall the solution written on a flashcard. If they succeed, they send the card to the next group. If they fail, they send it back to the first group. Each succeeding group has a longer period of time before the learner is required to revisit the cards.
In Leitner's original method, published in his book ''So lernt man Lernen'', the schedule of repetition was governed by the size of the partitions in the learning box. These were 1, 2, 5, 8 and 14cm. Only when a partition became full was the learner to review some of the cards it contained, moving them forward or back depending on whether they remembered them.

== Examples ==
===Three boxes===
[[File:Leitner system animation.gif|right|thumb|250px|Animation of three sessions. Click to enlarge]]
Suppose there are 3 boxes of cards called "Box 1", "Box 2" and "Box 3".  The cards in Box 1 are the ones that the learner often makes mistakes with, and Box 3 contains the cards that they know very well. They might choose to study the Box 1 cards once a day, Box 2 every 3 days, and the Box 3 cards every 5 days.  If they look at a card in Box 1 and get the correct answer, they "promote" it to Box 2.  A correct answer with a card in Box 2 "promotes" that card to Box 3.  If they make a mistake with a card in Box 2 or Box 3, it gets "demoted" to the first box, which forces the learner to study that card more often.

The advantage of this method is that the learner can focus on the most difficult flashcards, which remain in the first few groups. The result is, ideally, a reduction in the amount of study time needed.

===Proficiency levels===
This example uses 5 proficiency levels and 12 decks of flash cards. Cards at Proficiency Level 1 are reviewed at every learning session; those at Level 5 are retired and no longer in use. Those at Levels 2, 3, and 4 are reviewed every 2nd, 3rd, and 4th session, respectively.

Learning sessions are numbered from 0 to 9, then the numbering starts over again (that is, 0, 1, 2, ... 8, 9, 0, 1, 2 ...). Cards at Level 1 are in Deck Current; those at Level 5 are in Deck Retired; all other cards are in 1 of these 10 "progress" decks, each of which begins with a title card sporting 4 digits:

* 0-2-5-9  
* 1-3-6-0  
* 2-4-7-1  
* 3-5-8-2  
* 4-6-9-3  
* 5-7-0-4  
* 6-8-1-5  
* 7-9-2-6
* 8-0-3-7
* 9-1-4-8

If a learner is successful at a card from Deck Current, it gets transferred into the progress deck that begins with that session's number. (For example, success at a card during Session 6 transfers it from Deck Current to Deck 6-8-1-5.) Cards from that deck are reviewed whenever a number from the deck title matches the session number. (For example, cards from Deck 6-8-1-5 will be reviewed again at Sessions 8, 1, and 5.) If a learner has difficulty with a card during a subsequent review, the card is returned to Deck Current; otherwise it stays in its progress deck. When a learner is successful at a card during a session that matches the last number on the deck (for example, Session 5 for Deck 6-8-1-5), that card goes into Deck Retired, and the title card for that progress deck is freed up for use at the following session.

Ideas similar to these have been implemented into a number of [[computer-assisted language learning]] and [[List of flashcard software|flashcard software]].  Much of this software makes use of so-called "electronic flashcards".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8851">{{hatnote|This article describes simulation games used in marketing education and corporate training and should not be confused with usage of simulation techniques in the analysis of marketing activities.}}
'''Marketing simulation games''' provide participants with an interactive method of testing out marketing decisions in an environment which is virtual or which has game characteristics. Common game topics belong to categories such as: [[marketing strategy]], [[product positioning]], [[pricing strategies]], [[consumer behaviour]]. Marketing games usually focus on the marketing landscape of a certain business industry or a company {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}. A marketing simulation game usually contains a number of scenarios and provides participants with results in response to their decisions.

The games can be played either by individuals or teams. The learning environment is usually a collaborative and/or competitive market in which participants represent companies which need to take decisions in an iterative manner, usually on a round-by-round basis.

== In education ==

Faria and Wellington (2004) found that 64.1% of 1,085 faculty members surveyed in American Universities were using games with a focus on marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faria|first1=A.J.|last2=Wellington|first2=W.J.|title=Survey of simulation game users, former - users, and never - users|journal=Simulation and Gaming|date=2004|volume=35|issue=2|pages=178–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pedagogical  expectations  are  that  students  using  these simulations  will  learn  more  about  marketing  strategy concepts through the application of marketing knowledge as well as gain marketing application skills. 

The advance of digital technology in marketing has led to a gap in digital literacy among marketing professionals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=Lorna |title=Helping students understand the relevance of social media tools to marketing practitioners: A case study of a marketing principles module |journal=The Marketing Review |date=28 April 2014 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=5–27 |doi=10.1362/146934714X13948909473103 |url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/westburn/tmr/2014/00000014/00000001/art00002;jsessionid=vucxkjccml63.x-ic-live-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Consequently, there is increasing pressure for marketing educators to help their students develop digital marketing skills &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Payne |first1=Nathaniel J. |last2=Campbell |first2=Colin |last3=Bal |first3=Anjali S. |last4=Piercy |first4=Niall |title=Placing a Hand in the Fire: Assessing the Impact of a YouTube Experiential Learning Project on Viral Marketing Knowledge Acquisition |journal=Journal of Marketing Education |date=NaN |volume=33 |issue=2 |pmid= |url=http://www.learntechlib.org/p/50470/ |language=en |issn=0273-4753}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Computerized  marketing  simulation games  have  been  widely  used  as  teaching  and  learning  resources in  Marketing  Strategy  and  Management courses – and continue to be adopted as a meaningful pedagogical tool.&lt;ref name="Brooks &amp; Bradley,2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=W.

Research has found that students can use both marketing simulation games and real marketing projects with comparable feelings of reality and enhanced perceptions of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maher|first1=Jill K.|last2=Hughner|first2=Renee Shaw|title=Experiential Marketing Projects: Student Perceptions of Live Case and Simulation Methods|journal=Journal for Advancement of Marketing Education|date=2005|volume=7,|issue=Winter|page=8|url=http://www.mmaglobal.org/publications/JAME/JAME-Issues/JAME-Winter-2005/JAMEWinter2005v.7p.1-10.pdf|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Between 2008 and 2017 Google ran the "Google Onine Marketing Challenge" (GOMC), an online competition aimed at higher education students. The format of the competition allowed student teams to work with SMEs and nonprofit organizations in recognition that many marketing students are employed by one such organization. The goal of participants was to develop a precampaign report followed by online marketing campaigns. According to research, for an effective experiential learning activity instructors should emphasize that students need to plan, execute, and assess their actions, which requires the provision of feedback mechanisms as part of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Canhoto |first1=Ana Isabel |last2=Murphy |first2=Jamie |title=Learning From Simulation Design to Develop Better Experiential Learning Initiatives |journal=Journal of Marketing Education |date=13 April 2016 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=98–106 |doi=10.1177/0273475316643746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instructional design considerations===
There is a need for more empirical research to examine the varying characteristics in existing marketing simulations in light of various course requirements and various student groups.&lt;ref name="Brooks &amp; Bradley,2006" /&gt;  There is emerging instructional research on the learning framework proposed by marketing simulation games which focuses on how game analytics and learning analytics provide students with personalized experiences and how this increases their engagement. Often this research is focused on just one marketing simulation game platform used in a small number of universities coming from the same country or region.

Acceptance of computer-based simulation devices in learning can affect learning outcomes. It has been argued that computer-based simulation games, involving the use of technology that users are less familiar with, can place an additional burden on learners and generate frustration and low satisfaction that can negatively affect learning outcomes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brennan |first1=Ross |last2=Vos |first2=Lynn |last3=Brennan |first3=Ross |title=Marketing simulation games: student and lecturer perspectives |journal=Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning |date=26 October 2010 |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=882–897 |doi=10.1108/02634501011086472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valid criticism appears when students are involved in ‘gaming’ the simulation algorithm in search of higher returns. In this mode of play, students typically manifest behaviour where they adopt high-risk decisions, often giving little thought on the decision-making process itself, thus reducing learning outcomes. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Other usages of marketing simulations ==

Additional usage for marketing simulations has been identified: as an aid in decision making and as a  means for gaining further insight into a system as well as a guideline for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|displayauthors=etal|title=Simulation: An Effective Marketing Tool|journal=International Journal of Computer Applications|date=August 2010|volume=4|issue=11|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3808">'''Master in College''' is the title of the housemaster of College, the oldest boarding house at [[Eton College]], which is reserved for the seventy [[King's Scholar]]s.

King's Scholars (Collegers) attend Eton on scholarships provided under the original foundation by King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] in 1440 and awarded by examination each year. The school originally consisted of 70 scholars (half of the first intake had previously been educated at Winchester College) together with a small number of Commensals.

The boarding house in which Collegers live is in the central area of the school off School Yard, where both Eton College Chapel and Lupton's Tower are situated. It includes New Buildings and Chamber. Chamber, the older section, includes rooms which look out onto School Yard, while New Buildings is on the reverse side and contains the majority of the boys' living spaces.

The position of Master in College dates from 1846 when the New Buildings were finished, Long Chamber was divided up, and other long-overdue reforms took place. Prior to that the [[List of Head Masters of Eton College|Head Master]] had been directly responsible for the Scholars.&lt;ref name=CKP&gt;Charles Keegan Paul ''Memories''  Routledge, 1971 {{ISBN|0-7100-6944-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7100-6944-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mr C J Abraham [gave] up his overflowing boarding-house to take up the novel position of 'Assistant-Master in College' [sic]."&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell Lyte, A History of Eton College, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7882">The '''Miami Science Barge''' (also known as the '''Science Barge''') is a floating [[marine laboratory]] and education platform docked in [[Museum Park (Miami)|Museum Park]], [[Miami]], FL since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sentenac|first1=Hannah|title=Miami Science Barge to Debut in Museum Park Tomorrow for Earth Day|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/miami-science-barge-to-debut-in-museum-park-tomorrow-for-earth-day-8400738|accessdate=8 May 2017|date= April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barge, designed to help support a more sustainable city, has three main areas of focus: marine ecology and conservation, sustainability, and alternative agriculture. It is completely off-grid and off-pipe and provides approximately enough energy and food production to support an average American family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arrowsmith|first1=Sue|title=Miami Science Barge offers city children chance to explore nature|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/downtown-miami/article95794857.html|accessdate=8 May 2017|agency=Miami Herald|publisher=McClatchy|date=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first year, over 3000 students came aboard to learn about the innovative technology on the Barge. The vessel is open to the public on Saturday. 
The Miami Science Barge was conceived by Nathalie Manzano and designed by Manzano and [[Theodore Caplow|Ted Caplow]]. They were inspired by the [[Science Barge]] built in 2006 by New York Sun Works, designed by Caplow. The vessels are of similar size and both have a sustainable technology focus, but they respond to very different local environmentsand house differing technology and unique public education programs. The Miami Science Barge emphasizes aquaculture.
The Miami Science Barge was donated in April 2017 to the brand-new Philip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science, which currently owns and operates it.

== Early history == 
In 2015, [[Nathalie Manzano]] and [[Ted Caplow]] of [[CappSci]] won the [[Knight Cities Challenge]] grant competition from the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation]] with a proposal to build the Miami Science Barge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dahlberg|first1=Nancy|title=Miami Science Barge wins Knight award|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article16959965.html|accessdate=May 8, 2017|agency=Miami Herald|publisher=McClatchy|date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Barge was a 120x30 steel construction barge from [[Grady Marine]] retrofitted with 2nd-hand [[shipping container]]s in 2015. With the generosity of Beau Payne of P &amp; L Towing, the staff of CappSci were able to design and build the power system and exhibits of the Barge on the Miami River prior to moving it to its official location in Museum Park in downtown Miami, FL.
The Miami Science Barge opened on [[Earth Day]], April 22, 2016. The following April, the Barge was gifted to [[Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science]].

== Technical details ==
The Miami Science Barge has three main areas of focus:

===Sustainability ===
The Barge is fully [[off-grid]]. It utilizes 48 [[solar panel]]s (donated by JinkoSolar) to generate enough power to run all of its systems. These panels are set into five arrays including a [[solar dance floor]] and a [[solar tracking system]]. Power is stored into two sets of batteries: [[lead-acid batteries]], and experimental Aquion [[M-Line battery modules]]. The panels provide about 75Kwh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PennEnergy Editors|title=JinkoSolar Powers the Miami Science Barge|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/08/solar-power-news-jinkosolar-powers-the-miami-science-barge.html|website=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also [[off-pipe]], meaning that all of its fresh water comes from a rainwater catchment system located about the classroom area. The water is stored in a 900-gallon cistern. The salt water comes directly from [[Biscayne Bay]]. No discharge is released from the Barge. Waste water is collected in constructed wetland troughs where the water is filtered or in some cases may evaporate. 
Furthermore, the Barge aimed to utilize only sustainable material in construction, i.e. the [[Kebony]] deck throughout the farm area. Kebony is an eco-friendly alternative to tropical hardwoods, using a bio-based seal instead of a synthetic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miami Science Barge Opens|url=http://kebony.com/us/blog/miami-science-barge-opens/|website=Kebony.com|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The staff on the Barge also follow strict habits of sustainability, including prohibiting [[single-use plastic]]s from being used on board for events and by diligently cleaning debris found in the notch.

===Alternative agriculture===
On board are a variety of sustainable and unconventional agriculture systems including [[hydroponics]], [[aeroponics]], aquaculture, and aquaponics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miami Science Barge|url=https://ezgrogarden.com/commercial-sytems/miami-science-barge/|website=EZ Grow Gardens|publisher=Commercial Systems, News|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hydroponics and aeroponics are forms of growing produce that utilizes water and nutrients most efficiently. Aquaculture systems grow fish and other marine creature for consumption so as not to harm the balance in the ocean and aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture and aquaponics, where marine life produce waste which is consumed by plants.
On board is also a [[vertically integrated greenhouse]] (patented by Caplow and Zak W. Adams).

===Marine ecology and conservation===
Along with the [[aquaponic]] and [[aquaculture]] tanks, there are multiple tanks showcasing marine life. Towards the entrance of the Barge, there is a [[coral]] tank, developed with the help of Dr. [[Diego Lirman]] at the [[University of Miami]] and Rescue a Reef. It is the only tank in South Florida representing what [[Coral reef protection#Restoration|coral restoration]] in the wild looks like. Other exhibit tanks show sea life from Biscayne Bay, including [[sea horse]]s, a [[Petrochirus diogenes|giant hermit crab]], erosion-preventing [[sea grass]]es, [[mangrove]]s, and a myriad of local fish.

These tanks are used to educate about the importance of diversity in Miami’s local ecology. Guest scientists are invited most weekends and on the 3rd Wednesday of every month for Sip of Science to promote the conservation of the environment.

== Response ==
The Miami Science Barge opened on [[Earth Day]], April 22, 2016 and was attended by dignitary speakers including City of Miami Commissioner [[Frank Carollo]], who in his remarks called the Barge "a symbol of Miami's diversity not only in people, but in ideas, as well as, a symbol of our community's commitment to environmental education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miami Commissioner &amp; Bayfront Park  Management Trust Chairman Frank Carollo invites the public to the official launching of the Miami Science Barge, on Earth Day April 22nd|url=http://www.miamigov.com/comm/docs/Press_Releases/2016/04-19%20Miami%20Science%20Barge.htm|website=Miamigov.com|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Miami Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, Knight Foundation’s Miami Program Director Matt Haggman, and Children Trust’s Founding Board Chair David Lawrence, Jr. 
In December 2016, Miami Science Barge was named one of “The Ten Best Things to Do in Downtown Miami” by Miami New Times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shim Roth|first1=Minhae|title=The Ten Best Things to Do in Downtown Miami|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/the-ten-best-things-to-do-in-downtown-miami-8981277|accessdate=8 May 2017|agency=Miami New Times|date=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mikhail Mordkin''' ({{lang-ru|Михаил Михайлович Мордкин}}; December 9, 1880, [[Moscow]], [[Russian Empire]] - July 15, 1944, New York)&lt;ref&gt;[http://mirslovarei.com/content_his/mordkin-mixail-mixajlovich-32184.html ru: Historical Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; graduated from the [[Moscow State Academy of Choreography|Bolshoi Ballet School]] in 1899, and in the same year was appointed ballet master.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enc-dic.com/history/Mordkin-Mihail-Mihajlovich-26118.html Мордкин, Михаил Михайлович]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fille Mal Gardee -Sofia Fedorova as Lise, Grigory Riabtzev as Simone, Mikhail Mordkin as Colas.jpg|left|150px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Vladimir Riabtsev]] as the mother, Mikhail Mordkin as Colas &amp; [[Sofia Fedorova]] as Lise; ''[[La Fille mal gardée]]'' of [[Alexander Gorsky]], [[Bolshoi Theatre]], [[Moscow]]. ]]

He joined [[Ballets Russes|Diaghilev's ballet]] in 1909 as a leading dancer. After the first season he remained in Paris to dance with [[Anna Pavlova (dancer)|Pavlova]]. He then formed his own company, the All Star Imperial Russian Ballet, which toured America in 1911 and 1912.

Mikhail returned to the Bolshoi and was appointed its director in 1917.

He left Russia after the [[October Revolution]], first working in [[Lithuania]], and finally settling in the United States in 1924. He founded the [[Mordkin Ballet]] in 1926, for which he choreographed a complete ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and many other ballets. His company included such distinguished artists as Hilda Butsova, [[Felia Doubrovska]], [[Pierre Vladimiroff]], [[Vera Nemtchinova]] and [[Nicholas Zvereff]]. After a European tour the company disbanded in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-cafe.ru/days/bio/46/004_46.php  Михаил Мордкин. Греческий бог и римский гладиатор]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mordkin continued to be a freelance artist and teacher, including at the [[Cornish School]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;"Deja to Remain in City", ''The Seattle Times'', May 10, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; From among his students in America he formed a new Mordkin Ballet in 1937. Although he had been pushed into the background, Mordkin helped build the foundation for ballet in America.

Mikhail Mordkin died in [[Millbrook, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RgzG46gyQ7MC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;lpg=PA263&amp;dq=mikhail+mordkin+millbrook&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZP345eBunM&amp;sig=Q6NB-cJsJXaCtx9h8XnzbY6Wh8E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WPPnUIvgEaas4ASkuYGwCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mikhail%20mordkin%20millbrook&amp;f=false "Danza E Balletto: Dizionario"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Witness impeachment.jpg|thumb|Mock trials allow researchers to examine [[confirmation bias]]es in a realistic setting]]

A '''mock trial''' is an act or imitation [[trial (law)|trial]]. It is similar to a [[moot court]], but mock trials simulate lower-court trials, while moot court simulates [[appellate court]] hearings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/07/court-moot-court-mock-court-and-mock.html Court, Moot Court, Mock Court and Mock Trial], Available at Learning the Law.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawyer|Attorneys]] preparing for a real trial might use a mock trial consisting of volunteers as role players to test theories or experiment with each other.  Mock trial is also the name of an [[extracurricular]] program in which [[student]]s participate in rehearsed trials to learn about the legal system in a competitive manner. Interscholastic mock trials take place on all levels including [[primary school]], [[middle school]], [[high school]], [[college]], and [[law school]].  Mock trial is often taught in conjunction with a course in [[trial advocacy]] or takes place as an after school enrichment activity. Some gifted and talented programs may also take place in one.

==Litigation related mock trials==
Litigators may use mock trials to assist with trial preparation and settlement negotiations of actual cases. Unlike school-related mock trials, these mock trials can take numerous forms depending on the information sought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelawinsider.com/mock-trial-lawschool/what-is-a-mock-trial/ scholastic mock trials]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when faced with complex fact issues in a particular case, attorneys might convene a mini mock trial to try different methods of presenting their evidence, sometimes before a jury.

==Competitive school-related mock trials around the world==

===Asia Pacific===
[[Guam]] has been hosting the annual Asia-Pacific Invitational Mock Trial Competition. In 2011 and 2012, there were 14 teams from Guam, [[South Korea]], and [[Saipan]] in its 4th annual competition. The competition was held at [[Government of Guam#The Superior Court of Guam|the Superior Court of Guam]]. The teams made up of mostly junior and senior students from [[high school]]s. The Champion of the 4th Annual Asia-Pacific Invitational Mock Trial Competition was Marianas Baptist Academy of Saipan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MBA is Asia-Pacific invitational mock trial competition champion |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=123309 |accessdate=29 December 2012 |newspaper=Saipan Tribune |date=12 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526073517/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=123309 |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2005, the [[Surana and Surana Moots|Surana &amp; Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot]] was conceived as one of its kind  with the aim of promoting skills of trial advocacy. In its 10th successful year (2014), this national moot trial is one of the most appreciated for its innovation and structure. Popular demand led to the creation of three more editions of this unique trial competition [India North, India South, India North East &amp; India West (from 2014–15) rounds.] This competition  has the distinction of being the first ever to be held in the North Eastern region of India in 2012. The structure is such that  law students from the host institution participate by enacting the role of  witnesses for the oral rounds. The students and faculty welcome this, as it provides a unique opportunity to learn practical aspects of a trial, first hand.

===Australia===
Mock trial competitions in Australia are held regionally. These include:
* The Law Society of South Australia Mock Trial Competition comprises a series of simulated court cases by students [[Education in Australia|years 10, 11 and 12]] from 32 schools in [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.lawsocietysa.asn.au/other/mock_trial.asp|publisher=The Law Society of South Australia|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Law Society of Western Australia Interschool Mock Trial Competition is held each year for students enrolled in years 10, 11 and 12 in [[Western Australia]]. There were 773 students representing 68 teams from 38 schools participated in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trials Competition |url=http://www.lawsocietywa.asn.au/mock-trials.html |publisher=The Law Society of Western Australia |accessdate=29 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101085042/http://www.lawsocietywa.asn.au/mock-trials.html |archivedate=1 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Capital Region Mock Trial Competition is organized by [[University of Canberra]]. There were teams of schools in [[Australian Capital Territory]] region with year 10, 11 and 12 students.
* The New South Wales Mock Trial Competition has been running since 1981 for students years 10 and 11 in [[New South Wales]] initially with 28 schools. There have also been international events with mock trial competitions between Australia and the United Kingdom. In 2008, schools from this region also traveled to [[New York City]] to compete in the Empire Mock Trial Competition. The first Asia-Australia mock trial competition via video conference between Australian teams and a Korean team was held in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au/community/forschools/mocktrial/Mocktrial|publisher=The Law Society of New South Wales|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Jodie|title=First Asia-Australia mock trial|journal=The National Legal Eagle|date=10 January 2009|volume=15|issue=2|page=18|url=http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&amp;context=nle|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe===
Mock trials in continental Europe are less coordinated than their UK or US counterparts, but there are a few isolated examples. In Germany, the Faculty of Legal Sciences of the [[University of Regensburg]] organizes the REGINA Mock Trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REGINA Mock Trial: Der Gerichtssimulator|url=http://www.uni-regensburg.de/rechtswissenschaft/fakultaet/medien/regina/mock_trial_flyer_hp.pdf|website=University of Regensburg|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] organizes a mock trial specialized in administrative law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial im Verwaltungsprozessrecht|url=https://www.jura.rw.fau.de/mock-trial-im-verwaltungsprozessrecht-2/|website=Fachbereich Rechtswissenschaft|publisher=Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, there is a mock trial program specialized in [[insurance law]] coordinated by the [[Fernando Peña López|Fundacion INADE-UDC Chair of Risk Management and Insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veredicto Ejemplar|url=https://catedrafundacioninade.org/veredicto-ejemplar/2018|website=Cátedra Fundación INADE-UDC|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Bar Mock Trial}}
The Bar National Mock Trial Competition involves students to take on the roles of [[barrister]]s and [[witness]]es and present their case against teams from other schools. It has been running annually since 1991 with regional tournaments and the national final. There are 2,000 students in years 10 to 13, 300 barristers and advocates, and 90 judges involved in this competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bar National Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.citizenshipfoundation.org.uk/main/comps.php?175|publisher=Citizenship Foundation|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School Mock Court Case Project runs both primary and secondary school competitions primarily in Scotland, although has undertaken a number of international competitions. Currently some 100 schools, circa 3,000 students are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School Mock Court Project- Background|url=https://www.mockcourt.org.uk/background.php|publisher=School Mock Court Case Project SCIO|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=schools-mock-court-project-seeks-legal-tutors|url=https://www.scottishlegal.com/article/schools-mock-court-project-seeks-legal-tutors|publisher=Scottish Legal News|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=dundee-people-dundee-high-school-pupils-win-national-mock-trial-competition|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/dundee-people-dundee-high-school-pupils-win-national-mock-trial-competition/|publisher=DC Thomson Co Ltd|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Competition framework====
Competitive mock trial functions in yearly cycles.  Each year, a case packet is distributed to all participating schools in late summer to early fall.  The case packet is a series of documents including the charges, penal code, stipulations, case law, and jury instructions as well as all [[Exhibit (legal)|exhibits]] and [[affidavit]]s relevant to the case.  During a mock trial, competitors are restricted to only the materials provided in the case packet and may not reference any outside sources.  In order to prepare for competition, teams thoroughly read and analyze the case packet.

National mock trial teams consist of a minimum of six and a maximum of twelve official members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/AMTA%20Rulebook%202012%20HL.pdf |title=American Mock Trial Association Rulebook, Page 16 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The size of state mock trial teams can vary; California, for example, allows up to 25 official team members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crf-usa.org/images/stories/mt_la/2014-15_mock_trial_team_rulebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each team prepares both sides of the case:  prosecution and defense in a criminal trial, plaintiff and defense in a civil action.  Each side is composed of two or three attorneys as well as two or three witnesses, all played by members of the team. Teams must be organized into two sides of five to six players for the prosecution/plaintiff and defense.&lt;ref name = "rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmocktrial.org/fullrules.cfm |title=National High School Mock Trial Championship |publisher=Nationalmocktrial.org |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Public_Resources/Law,_Youth_and_Citizenship/Mock_Trial_Tournament/Mock_Trial_Tournament.htm NYSBA Mock Trial] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that high school mock trial is governed by state bar associations, meaning that cases, rules, and competition structure vary from state to state whereas all of college mock trial is governed by the American Mock Trial Association, meaning that every school uses the same case and is subject to the same rules.

====Procedure====
[[Image:Mock trial closing.jpg|thumb|A [[student]] giving his closing argument during a mock trial]]

The mock trial begins with the judge entering the courtroom. The judge then gives out the instructions to the jury (about what they are to listen to). Then if there is a pretrial motion, the defense and prosecution give their respective pretrial arguments. The judge then lets the prosecution or plaintiff give an opening statement. Following the prosecution/plaintiff's opening statement, the judge may offer the defense to deliver the opening statement during that time as well, or to wait until after the prosecution has presented all of its witnesses. After the opening statements, examination of the witnesses begins. The prosecution/plaintiff calls their witnesses first. Witnesses are sworn in by their team's bailiff/timekeeper. A student competitor attorney for the prosecution/plaintiff does a direct examination of the witness. Once the direct examination is complete, the opposing team may cross-examine the witness. After the cross-examination, if the first team chooses, they may redirect the witness and, likewise, the other team may do a re-cross after this. However, redirect and re-cross examinations are only limited to the scope of the previous examination conducted by opposing counsel. This process is repeated for the two remaining plaintiff witnesses. Once the prosecution/plaintiff have finished with their witnesses, the defense may give their opening statement if not delivered before, and then the process is repeated with the defense witnesses, having the defense attorneys direct and the plaintiff attorneys cross-examine.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt;

Once all of the witnesses have been examined, the trial moves to closing arguments. The prosecutor/plaintiff again goes first and has the option to reserve time before hand for rebuttal. After the defense finishes their closing argument, the plaintiff may give their rebuttal argument if they still have time remaining. In some competitions, the rebuttal is limited to the scope of the defense’s closing argument.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; Time limits are set at each level of competition to prevent the trials from running too long and to keep rounds of competition running smoothly. Time limits are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Time Limits of Mock Trial Competition
!Statement/Examination/Argument
!Time Limit
|-
|Opening Statement
|5 minutes
|-
|Direct and Redirect Examination
|25 minutes
|-
|Cross and Recross Examination
|25 minutes
|-
|Pre-Closing Preparation
|2 minutes
|-
|Closing Argument
|9 minutes
|-
|Rebuttal (Prosecution only)
|Amount of time reserved before closing
|}
Time limits may vary from state-to-state competitions. Please note that time is kept track of by the bailiff/timekeeper, who times their co-counsel's statements, examinations, and arguments. Time is stopped for objections.

==== Objections ====
A main part of Mock Trial is the raising and arguing of objections given by opposing teams. Objections are raised when the opposing counsel attempts to bring in evidence or testimony that go against the rules of evidence. When an objection is raised, the judge may either overrule or sustain it immediately, or ask opposing counsel for their argument about why the testimony/evidence is admissible. Time is paused for objections, so an objection "battle" could go on for hours at a time until the judge makes a ruling. Mock Trial students receive an abridged version of [[Rules of evidence|Rules of Evidence]] to base their objections on in the case packet that contains the witness affidavits and other elements of the court case.

====Judging====
[[Image:Mock trial critique.jpg|thumb|left|Attorney evaluators give a critique at the end of a mock trial competition.]]

There are several different ways that a mock trial can be judged. In one, the judges for scoring the mock trial consist of the presiding judge and two scoring judges, all of whom score the teams. In a second method, there are two scoring judges and the presiding judge, as in the first method, but the presiding judge does not score the teams, rather the judge simply votes or casts a ballot for one team or another.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; In yet another method of judging, there are three scoring judges and the presiding judge is not involved in the scoring of the teams. Often at college invitationals, there are two scoring judges, one of whom doubles as the presiding judge. Since enticing attorneys to judge is notoriously difficult (as judges are rarely compensated with more than a free lunch), it is rare to see more than two judges in a round at most competitions.

Unlike real law, the victorious team does not necessarily have to win on the merits of the case. Instead, evaluators score individual attorneys and witnesses on a 1-10 scale (though some states use different scales for high school competitions) based on each stage of the trial. These consist of the opening statements for the plaintiff and defense, each of the witnesses’ testimony, direct and cross-examination by attorneys, and the closing statements for both sides. The team with the highest total number of points is often, but not always, the team that wins the judge's verdict. Given this method of scoring, it is possible for the defendant to be found guilty or lose the case but for the defense team to still win the round.

In some competitions, points can be deducted from a team’s score for testifying with information outside the scope of the mock trial materials and for unsportsmanlike conduct or abuse of objections. However, scores are completely at a judge's discretion, meaning that scores are subjective based on different evaluation criteria.

====Power matching====
In the first round of the tournament, all of the teams are randomly matched to compete with each other. After the first round of some tournaments, teams are “power matched” to go up against other teams with similar records (e.g. in the second round, a 1-0 team will be matched with another 1-0 team).&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; If there is a tie in record, the judges will use the number of ballots and total points earned to decide the matching.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; This allows for teams to compete with other teams of similar skill.

=====National championship format=====
In the national championship format, which is also employed by invitationals across the country, the tournament is power matched through the last round. While this determines the strongest team at the tournament overall, it does not provide an accurate representation of 2nd, 3rd, 4th place teams, etc., because they might have lost multiple ballots to a strong team who placed first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/mock/tabulation.php |title=The American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Collegemocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Exceptions=====
Of course, there are practical exceptions to the theory of power matching. Tab room coordinators who are creating brackets for each round may deviate from the rules of power matching in order to 1. allow each team to alternate between prosecution/plaintiff and defense between rounds, 2. avoid two teams from the same school competing against each other (Maryland Rule), 3. avoid having a team compete against a team it played in a prior round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tba.org/mocktrial/2010_stateforms/powermatching.pdf ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Power protection=====
When tournaments are power protected, it means that the first rounds of competition are power matched as stated above. In the last round(s), however, the team with the strongest record is paired against the team with the weakest record. This ensures that the best teams do not knock each other out of the running for a rank. Rather, it's anticipated that the stronger team will win and protect their chance at a rank, while there is no harm done to the weaker team who is already out of reach of a trophy. Additionally, this method gives weaker teams exposure to stronger programs that they can learn from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collegemocktrial.org/mock/tabulation_files/0809tabmanualfebruaryupdate_2-3-09.doc |title=American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Levels of competition====

=====Elementary school=====
At the elementary school level, the mock trial guide by [[American Bar Association]] suggests to use role-playing from scripted mock trials such as [[fairy tale]] mock trials as a way to introduce the concept of conflicts, trials, jury verdicts in civil trials, vocabulary of the court, damages, and the roles of individuals portrayed in the trial. Therefore, most of mock trials at this level are non-competitive classroom activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Putting on mock trials.|year=2002|publisher=Division for Public Education, American Bar Association|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=1-59031-154-X|url=http://lre.ncbar.org/media/27617684/mocktrialguide.pdf|edition=[Rev. ed.].}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no national competition for this level. However, a few states offer intrastate competitions. There are a couple difference formats of competitions for this level.

The first format focuses on how the cases are developed such as ''New Jersey Law Fair'' competitions. Students grades 3 to 6 are asked to generate, develop and write the case from their own idea to include details of the facts, issue, witnesses, statements, instructions, sub-issues, concepts and law. As the students at this age range may not know the details of applicable law, students are allowed to create their own law. There are no specific themes, students can choose any age-appropriate topics. The students are encouraged to do a role-playing in a mock trial based on the script that they have developed to involve other students in the classroom as juries in order to refine their case. Each team plays the roles of both side in their case during the mock trial. The winners will perform their case in the real court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law Fair for 3rd through 6thgraders|url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11471/Law%20Fair%202013%20Rules%20Booklet.pdf|publisher=The New Jersey State Bar Foundation|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204030526/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11471/Law%20Fair%202013%20Rules%20Booklet.pdf|archive-date=4 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Carolina, the competition has a different format which focuses more on presentation skills. All teams are given the same case which has been written prior to the competition and students are asked to perform role-playing on the case. ''North Carolina Elementary School Mock Trial Competition'' uses the winning entries from New Jersey Law Fair in the prior year as the cases for students to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Elementary School Mock Trial Competition|url=http://lre.ncbar.org/programs/elementary-mock-trial-competition|publisher=North Carolina Bar Association|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228180514/http://lre.ncbar.org/programs/elementary-mock-trial-competition|archive-date=28 December 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another format is to follow the standard format similar to the high school level but with less technical restriction. All teams are given the same material related to a case and prepare for the competition. Two teams compete in a live mock trial to represent two sides of the case. This format is used in the ''New Hampshire Bar Association's Mock Trial Competition''. However, the first round of the competition is done by video submission where each team performs in both sides of the case. The qualified teams will be invited to the live competition with each team on each side of the case.&lt;ref name="nh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition Handbook|url=http://www.nhbar.org/uploads/pdf/LRE-MT-CompetitionHandbook.pdf|publisher=New Hampshire Bar Association’s Law-Related Education Program|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Middle school=====
Although there is no national competition for middle/junior high school level, there are many intrastate competitions held by state/county level organizers:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; With the exception of New Jersey, all competitions have similar format as in high school competitions with some rules relaxed. In New Jersey, the format is similar to the ''New Jersey Law Fair'' at the elementary school level with two specific themes that the teams can choose to develop their cases.

=====High school=====
The mock trial program was started to allow high school students to experience the courtroom in a hands-on role. The mock trials are set up and structured just like a real court, bound by the same rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalexplorer.com/education/education-mock.asp |title=Mock Trial Education |publisher=Legalexplorer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can help the students to know exactly what role each of the different people in a court (judges, lawyers, witnesses, etc.) do in the judicial system. High school competitions are even held in functional court rooms in the local City Hall to lend additional authenticity to the trial. Cases typically have to do with problems faced by teens, and will usually involve teenagers as witnesses. Each year the case for pre-Nationals competitions alternates between a [[Civil case]] and a [[Criminal case]].

[[File:Mock trial team - Benet Academy.JPG|right|thumb|A high school mock trial team in [[Illinois]]]]
The [[National High School Mock Trial Championship]] started in 1984.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; This first competition consisted of teams from Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; The competition since has grown and now is considered to be an All-State tournament. Each year, various participating states around the country take turns hosting the tournament. The 2011 Championship was held in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]  hosted in 2012, [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] hosted in 2013, [[Madison, Wisconsin]] hosted in 2014, and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] is hosting in 2015. New York State does not participate in the national competition; rather, it has its own intrastate competition consisting of over 350 teams throughout the state. It follows similar rules to that of the national competition. New York has three levels of play, county competition, regional competition, and the finals, which is held in [[Albany, New York]] in May. The state of Maryland also does not compete in the National High School tournament, and thus has their own [[Maryland High School Mock Trial Competition|statewide mock trial competition]] similar to that of New York. New Jersey and North Carolina both pulled out of the NHSMTC competition following the 2005 season due to a refusal by the organization to accommodate an Orthodox Jewish team, Torah Academy of Bergen County, that had won New Jersey's state championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Public_Resources/Law,_Youth_and_Citizenship/Mock_Trial_Tournament/Mock_Trial_Tournament.htm |accessdate=October 17, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both states rejoined in 2010 after their concerns regarding accommodation had been addressed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalmocktrial.org/about/history-and-winners/&lt;/ref&gt;

Each state has its own case every year that is different from the national case. This means that the winners of the state competitions, who move on to nationals, must study and prepare a completely different case in time for the National High School Mock Trial Competition in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalexplorer.com/education/education-mock.asp |title=Law-related Education: Mock Trial main |publisher=Legalexplorer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national competition is governed by National Mock Trial Championship, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalmocktrial.org |title=National High School Mock Trial Championship, Inc |publisher=Nationalmocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====College=====
Inter-collegiate mock trial is governed by the American Mock Trial Association or AMTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegemocktrial.org |title=American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Collegemocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This organization was founded in 1985 by Dean Richard Calkins of Drake Law School and serves as a regulator of mock trial competition at the collegiate level.  AMTA sponsors regional and national-level competitions, writes and distributes case packets and rules, and keeps a registry of mock trial competitors and alumni.&lt;ref name="cooke1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooke |first=Jason |title=American Mock Trial Association |url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/welcome/welcome.php |accessdate=2012-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222093720/http://www.collegemocktrial.org/welcome/welcome.php |archivedate=2012-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case packet is generally written and distributed prior to the scholastic year in August, and case changes are made throughout the season, usually in September, December, and finally in February after Regional competitions and prior to the Opening Round of Championships. Approximately 600 teams from over 350 universities and colleges will compete in AMTA tournaments.  In total, AMTA provides a forum for over 5,300 undergraduate students each academic year to engage in intercollegiate mock trial competitions across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/about-amta/history-/|title=History of AMTA|publisher=American Mock Trial Association|accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the inter-collegiate circuit, a mock trial team consists of three attorneys and three witnesses on each side of the case (plaintiff/prosecution and defense). The attorneys are responsible for delivering an opening statement, conducting direct and cross examinations of witnesses and delivering closing arguments. Witnesses are selected in a [[draft (sports)|sports draft]] format from a pool of approximately eight to 10 available witnesses prior to the round. Typical draft orders are DPDPDP, PPPDDD, or DDPPPD but this may vary substantially between cases. Witnesses may be available only to the plaintiff/prosecution, only to the defense, or to both sides of the case. Witnesses consist of both experts as well as lay witnesses. Judges are usually attorneys or coaches, and in some occasions, practicing judges.

All collegiate mock trial cases take place in the fictional state of Midlands, USA.  Midlands is not geographically situated and falls under the protection of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name="cooke1"/&gt;

======Tournament competition======
A tournament consists of four rounds, two on each side of the case, typically scored by two to three judges in each round.  The season runs in two parts: the invitational season and the regular season. Invitational tournaments are held throughout the fall semester and into early spring across the country.  At invitationals, teams have the opportunity to test out particular case theories and improve as competitors before facing the challenge and pressure of regular season competition.

The regular season begins in late January, starting with regional tournaments. There are typically more than 600 teams spread across 24 regional tournaments. Each school is limited to two post-regional bids to the "Opening Round Championship Series." Though there were once direct bids from Regionals to the National Championship Tournament, these bids no longer exist. 192 teams advance to the Opening Round Championship, which is held at eight different tournament sites. The top teams at each Opening Round Championship Tournament qualify for a berth in the National Championship Tournament. There are 48 total bids to the final tournament.

For 22 years, the National Championship Tournament was held in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], the city in which collegiate mock trial began. The tournament left Iowa for the first time in 2007 when [[Stetson University]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] hosted the Championship. The 2008 National Championship Tournament was held in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. Between 2009-2011, the Championship returned to Des Moines in odd-numbered years, while even-numbered years featured a different venue. The 2010 Championship was hosted by [[Rhodes College]] at courthouses in downtown [[Memphis, Tennessee]], while the 2012 Championship was held in Minneapolis.  Beginning in 2013, future Championships will be awarded solely on a competitive bidding process, although Des Moines, if it bids, will be given preference during "landmark" years, such as anniversaries of AMTA's founding in 1985.  The 2013 Championship was held in [[Washington, D.C.]] with the [[University of Virginia]] handling hosting duties.  The 2014 Championship was held in [[Orlando, Florida]] at the [[Orange County Courthouse (Florida)|Orange County Courthouse]], with the [[University of Central Florida]] serving as the host institution. The 2015 Championship was hosted by the [[University of Cincinnati]], with trials held at the [[Hamilton County Courthouse (Ohio)|Hamilton County Courthouse]] in [[Cincinnati]]. The 2016 Championship was hosted by Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. In 2017, the Championship tournament will be hosted by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] (Stanley Mosk Courthouse) in downtown LA.

======Past championship results======
In 2006, the University of Virginia beat Harvard University to win the National Championship.&lt;ref name="cav"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=26730&amp;pid=1430 |title=Mock Trial team wins national championship |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |publisher=The Cavalier Daily |year=2006 |author=Jacqueline Minneman, Cavalier Daily Associate Editor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310182406/http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=26730&amp;pid=1430 |archivedate=March 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In what was the closest final round in AMTA history, the University of Virginia won the championship by a single point using a tiebreaker, after a three judge panel split with one judge choosing Virginia as the winner, one choosing Harvard, and one calling the round a draw. The University of Virginia's victory ended the then-recent run by UCLA, which had won the two previous national championships.

In 2007, the University of Virginia again defeated Harvard University. This marked the first ever re-match of a previous year's final round. Virginia again won via a split decision, winning two of the three ballots in the final round. Virginia also became the 4th school to repeat as champions, joining UCLA, the University of Iowa, and Rhodes College, which accomplished the feat twice. Harvard University became the second program to finish as runner up in consecutive years, joining the University of Maryland, College Park. Maryland, however, had the distinction of losing to themselves in one of those two defeats.

In 2008, the University of Maryland prevailed over the George Washington University in a split-ballot decision (2-1). This was Maryland's fifth title, giving them more total wins than any other university in AMTA history.

In 2009, Northwood University defeated George Washington University 5-0 to claim its first National Championship.

In 2010, New York University defeated Harvard University 3-1-1 to win its first National Championship. This was Harvard's third championship round appearance in the last five years following its consecutive losses to Virginia.

In 2011, UCLA defeated defending champion New York University 4-1 to claim the Bruins' third title, the third-most in the history of the American Mock Trial Association.

In 2012, Duke defeated Rutgers 2-1, in what was the first championship round appearance for both squads.

In 2013, Florida State University defeated Rhodes College in FSU's first championship round appearance by a 4-1 ballot decision. This was Rhodes' eighth championship round appearance to date.  2013 also marked the first year that the National Championship Tournament had 3 scoring judges per round (instead of 2).

In 2014, UCLA defeated Princeton University in a 3-2 ballot decision.  With this victory, UCLA tied Rhodes for the second-highest record of championships (4 wins), behind University of Maryland, College Park (5 wins).  This round was also Princeton's first championship round appearance.

In 2015, Harvard defeated Yale in a 4-0-1 ballot decision.  This marked Harvard's first championship win, despite having been the runner-up 3 times previously (in 2006, 2007, and 2010).  2015 also marked Yale's first championship round appearance.  Finally, 2015 marked the first year that the case problem for the National Championship Tournament was different from the case schools had been using in competition for the earlier elimination rounds.  (I.e. In the past colleges had argued the same case all year long, but starting in 2015 any team that qualified for the championship tournament was given a brand new case to learn and argue in the span of just a few weeks.)

In 2016, Yale won its first national championship in an 11-3-1 ballot decision, defeating the University of Virginia in the final trial. Yale is one of only nine schools to have competed in the final trial of the National Championship Tournament two years in a row.  2016 also marked the first year that the National Championship Tournament had 5 scoring judges per round, and 15 scoring judges in the final championship round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/about-amta/history-/national-championship-trial-results/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Virginia defeated Yale in a 6-1 ballot decision in a rematch of the 2016 final. Yale's appearance marked the first time in collegiate championship history the same school has appeared three consecutive times in the final championship round.

In 2018, Miami University of Ohio defeated Yale in a 4-3 ballot decision. This was Miami's second championship, the first having been in 2001. Yale extended its record of consecutive championship round appearances to 4, having been the champion in 2016 and the runner-up in 2017 and 2015.

* From 1992 until 2010, the "Maryland Rule" was in effect, which placed both teams from the same school in the same division in order to ensure there wouldn't be another championship round between two teams from the same school. The Maryland Rule was repealed before the 2010-11 season.

======Forums and social media======
Beyond merely competitive interactions, collegiate mock trial has established a presence in cyberspace. Some mock trial teams have created forums for themselves on [[Facebook]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Stanford Mock Trial|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/2200023395/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Miami Mock Trial|url=http://www.facebook.com/groups/2200142332/?ref=ts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoofs of characters from various cases have even made their way onto Facebook with their very own profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Joey Davis|url=https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001739776485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Brett Miller|url=http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001742140118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the American Mock Trial Association has a [[Twitter]] feed which provides updates on procedures and tournament results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter:  College Mock Trial @AMTAMockTrial|url=https://twitter.com/amtamocktrial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable presence of collegiate mock trial on the internet is Perjuries [http://www.perjuries.com], the national online mock trial community. On Perjuries, mock trial competitors, coaches, and alumni can create user accounts and post in a wide range of forums about mock trial and mock trial related issues.  Here, participants can discuss everything from case strategy to incidents in competition that they found humorous.  Furthermore, Perjuries provides a space for competitors to post tournament results and rank their competition.  The site is wildly popular boasting over 5,000 registered users, 2,000 discussions, and nearly 88,000 posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perjuries.com|url=http://www.perjuries.com/forums/forum.php|access-date=2012-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307045832/http://www.perjuries.com/forums/forum.php|archive-date=2012-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Law school=====
In the United States, law schools participate in interscholastic mock trial/trial advocacy. Teams typically consist of several "attorneys" and several "witnesses" on each side. A round consists of two law students acting as "attorneys" for each side.

The trial typically, although not always, begins with motions in limine and housekeeping matters, then moves through opening statements, witness testimony (both direct examination and cross examination), and finishes with a closing argument, sometimes called a summation. Throughout the trial, rules of evidence apply, typically the Federal Rules of Evidence, and objections are made applying these rules.

Every team in a tournament is given the same "problem" or "case", typically several months in advance, but for some tournaments only a few weeks ahead of the tournament's start. The problems can be criminal or civil, which affects many procedural aspects of the trial, for instance the increased rights of a criminal defendant not to testify against himself. The cases are written in an attempt to create an equal chance of either side prevailing, since the main objective is not to identify the winner of the case, but rather the team with superior advocacy skills.

Occasionally the winners of mock trial tournaments receive special awards such as money or invitations to special events, but the status of winning a tournament is significant in and of itself.

In addition, a university may require a mock trial course or courses as a requirement for graduation; among such universities is [[Baylor Law School]], whose third-year Practice Court courses are mandatory for all students and have been since the school's reopening in the 1920s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9189">'''Museum folklore''' is a domain of scholarship and professional practice within the field of folklore studies ([[folkloristics]]).

{{Portal|Folklore}} 

== Characteristics ==
Some museum folklorists work full-time in museums of [[ethnography]], [[ethnology]], [[cultural history]], or [[folk art]], often as educators, [[curators]], and directors. Others work in other settings, such as in [[public folklore]] programs, academic departments, community-based organizations, and consultancies. Such folklorists either partner with museums in the development of scholarly and public programs or study the history and impact of such work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewhurst|first1=C. Kurt|title=Folklife and Museum Practice: An Intertwined History and Emerging Convergences|journal=Journal of American Folklore|date=2014|volume=127|issue=505|pages=247–263|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key themes in museum folklore include policies and practices relating to tangible and intangible [[cultural heritage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China-US Folklore and Intangible Cultural Heritage Project|url=http://www.afsnet.org/?page=FICH|website=American Folklore Society|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intangible Cultural Heritage and Ethnographic Museum Practice|url=http://www.afsnet.org/?page=FICH2|website=American Folklore Society|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; museums as [[sites of conscience]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of International Folk Art (USA)|url=http://www.sitesofconscience.org/members/museum-of-international-folk-art/|website=International Coalition of Sites of Conscience|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; museums and cultural tourism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirshenblatt-Gimblett|first1=Barbara|title=Destination Culture: Tourism, Museums, and Heritage|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520209664}}&lt;/ref&gt; and museums as sites of innovation relative to the digital preservation, presentation, and access to cultural heritage collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bol|first1=Marsha|last2=Dewhurst|first2=C. Kurt|last3=Hertz|first3=Carrie|last4=Jackson|first4=Jason Baird|last5=MacDowell|first5=Marsha|last6=Seeman|first6=Charlie|last7=Seriff|first7=Suzy|last8=Sheehy|first8=Daniel|title=Rethinking the Role of Folklore in Museums: Exploring New Directions for Folklore in Museum Policy and Practice|date=2015|publisher=American Folklore Society|location=Bloomington, IN|url=http://www.afsnet.org/?page=FLMuseum|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum folklore practice has often focused on ways of animating the object-centered nature of the museum through events and activities that bring the people behind heritage collections into engagement with museum audiences, as through such activities as museum-based [[artist in residency]] programs, [[folk festivals]], and art and craft sales markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Patricia|last2=Seeman|first2=Charlie|title=Folklife and Museums: Selected Readings|date=1987|publisher=American Association of State and Local History|location=Nashville, TN|isbn=0910050856|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15521284|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant interaction and overlap between museum folklore and the neighboring field of [[museum anthropology]], as well as the interdisciplinary field of [[material culture]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berlinger|first1=Gabrielle A.|title=Ethnography as a Strategy in Museum Preservation|journal=Practicing Anthropology|date=2015|volume=37|issue=3|pages=34-34|doi=10.17730/0888-4552-37.3.34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewhurst|first1=C.

Sharpe|location=Armonk, NY|isbn=9780765680525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==

An organizational home for the sub-field in the United States and Canada is the [http://www.afsnet.org/?page=MuseumSection Folklore and Museums section] of the [[American Folklore Society]]. Among folklorists, this section is cognate to the [[Council for Museum Anthropology]] among museum anthropologists.

'''Mytown''', an acronym for '''Multicultural Youth Tour of What's Now''', was a [[List of youth organizations|youth organization]] based in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States|USA]], engaging young people in learning about and teaching others about the local history of their urban neighborhood.

==History and mission==
Mytown was founded in 1995 by Karilyn Crockett, with a mission to "use the process of sharing local history to empower young people and build appreciation of urban neighborhoods. Mytown believes that young people and communities can realize the power local history has in increasing youth activism and decreasing the stereotypes that stigmatize urban neighborhoods." 

Since the organization's founding, mytown has trained nearly 300 low and moderate-income Boston teenagers in learning the history of their neighborhood, community and city. Once trained, members lead historical walking tours of Boston's neighborhoods to almost 10,000 Boston residents and visitors annually.

==Founding idea==
Founder Karilyn Crockett, as a young [[African American]] girl, felt disconnected from Boston, the city in which she was raised. She went on a walking tour of [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] and the [[South End, Boston|South End]], learning about the history of the Pullman Porters, Tent City Settlement, and about the many migrants and immigrants from around the world that had built and transformed Boston over 350 years. Crockett's tour was transformative; for the first time she felt that Boston was a place that she could call "my town."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6113">An '''online college fair''', or '''virtual college fair''', is a relatively recent phenomenon that consists of a collection of colleges and universities that communicate and provide information online during a specific timeframe.  An online college fair operates according to several of the usual conventions of a “brick and mortar” college fair: there are event halls, schools have booths that prospective students and/or parents can visit to exchange information, and there are speaker sessions by various admissions and education experts.  However, the entire fair is contained online, and therefore an online college fair can also have many of the characteristics of a [[virtual world]].
One of the main benefits of an online college fair is that travel cost is eliminated for both school representatives and students.

==History==
The first such online college fair was organized by the [[National Association for College Admission Counseling]] (NACAC) and held on October 9, 2001. Approximately 200 institutions participated; the number of participating students is unknown. This first online college fair was widely considered a failure as the number of students trying to log on overloaded the system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/free/2002/08/2002080901t.htm The Chronicle for Higher Education]&lt;/ref&gt; NACAC, which planned on conducting online college fairs on a regular basis, discontinued the program after the initial event.

Additional online college fair providers have come and gone.  Gradschools.com hosted an online college fair in conjunction with a live fair.  This event also ran into technical difficulties; namely firewall problems and recruiters that were not prepared to use the online chat features.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/library/p435015/matrix-the-magazine-for-leaders-in-higher-education/ Matrix: The Magazine for Leaders in Education]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914234115/https://www.questia.com/library/p435015/matrix-the-magazine-for-leaders-in-higher-education/ |date=September 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2002, the Big Apple College Fair also had an online college fair in conjunction with a live fair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2222136/Big-Apple-College-Fair-for.html PR Newswire]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, [[BusinessWeek]], which produces annual rankings of United States business school [[MBA]] programs, held a MBA Expo 2007 with the tagline “Find the B-School that fits you best.”  A total of 8 US and international business schools attended.

[[CollegeWeekLive]] entered the market in November 13, 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2007-11-12-virtual-college-fair_N.htm USA Today]&lt;/ref&gt; and continues as the leading provider of online college fairs today. CollegeWeekLive grew 67% in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitybusiness.com/news/virtual-college-fair-provider-collegeweeklive-grows-67-2012-fueled-partnerships-new-products University Business]&lt;/ref&gt;

CappexConnect launched in 2013. Part of the Cappex family of websites, CappexConnect is a website dedicated to hosting online college fairs and online open houses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cappexconnect.com CappexConnect]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Online College Fairs==
On March 23 &amp; 24, 2011 [[CollegeWeekLive]] conducted the largest online college fair up until that date, with over 60,000 event attendees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collegeweeklive.com&lt;/ref&gt; The fair allowed attendees to interact with college admissions officials and college students from 250 schools via instant messaging and video chat.  The fair also included 15 keynote speakers addressing several topics including financial aid, diversity, college essays. etc. Speakers included Lynn O'Shaughnessy, college blogger at [[CBS MoneyWatch]] and [[Harlan Cohen]], Author of The Naked Roommate.

CappexConnect hosts online college fairs multiple times throughout the year, providing students the opportunity to connect with hundreds of colleges and universities and thousands of students from across the country. Students can chat directly with college and university representatives as well as fellow prospective students. Students can watch live presentations from admissions experts and financial aid specialists on topics such as choosing a college, financial aid, and choosing a major. Attendees also have the opportunity to enter to win a college scholarship. On September 10, 2013 and October 9, 2013, CappexConnect hosted a fall fair series that included over 15,000 student attendees visiting online booths from over 90 colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.cappex.com/blog/college-life/cappexconnect-online-college-fair-what-is-it/ Cappex College Insider]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
College Fairs Online is a new website devoted to high quality virtual college fairs.  They hold college fairs by state and connect many colleges with prospective students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collegefairsonline.com&lt;/ref&gt;

VASA Virtual Education Expo conducts virtual education fairs which bring together universities and potential students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualeducationexpo.com&lt;/ref&gt;

With more people utilizing the web for college search information as well as with the spread of broadband internet access, online college fairs are becoming a major resource for college application information. Colleges are continuously using online chat as a way to connect with prospective students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-admissions-chat-20130102,0,81673.story Los Angeles Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

College fairs offer students that might not otherwise have easy access to college information or the ability to visit colleges. Univision Media, in collaboration with CollegeWeekLive, held a virtual college fair&lt;ref&gt;[http://vidayfamilia.univision.com/es-el-momento/educate/noticias/article/2012-09-20/semana-educacion-es-el-momento-univision-college-fair-week-live Vida y Familia, Univision]&lt;/ref&gt; with several presentations in Spanish.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8441">[[File:Stop The Killing KC Headquarters entrance, October 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance of Stop The Killing KC headquarters building, October 2012.]]'''Stop The Killing KC''' is a community improvement organization in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] patterned after ''"stop the violence/stop the killing"'' movements in other large American cities, urged since 1985 by Minister [[Louis Farrakhan]] of the [[History of the Nation of Islam|Nation of Islam]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-06/local/me-628_1_los-angeles-street-gang George Farrakhan to Speak to 900 Gang Leaders to 'Stop the Killing'] [[Los Angeles Times]], October 6, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and drawing on lessons learned in past decades by many other community improvement organizations such as [[urban development]] programs in various U.S. Cities and evangelical or social outreach programs of various churches, religions or groups.

==History==
The Kansas City organization became unofficially established with a ''Declaration of Unity'' signed by [[Nation of Islam]] Student Minister Vincent Muhammad, Pastor Tony R. Caldwell of [[Community United KC]], Kenneth "Sasteh Meter" Mosley of [http://emwot.ws EMWOT](East Meets West of Troost), and more than three dozen other community improvement activists on September 17, 2011.

After several meetings and discussions in ensuing weeks, Pastor Caldwell, Captain Muhammad, Sasteh Meter Mosley, and other community leaders met at the [[Bruce R. Watkins Cultural Heritage Center]] on Feb. 11, 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kshb.com/dpp/news/local_news/community-leaders-hold-forum-to-stop-violence-in-kansas-city Community leaders hold forum to stop violence in Kansas City] [[KSHB-TV]], February 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and called for all interested persons to meet the following Saturday, February 18, and create a working organization.  On March 3, 2012, an organizational meeting elected officers, including a President and Vice-President, but in mid-May policy disagreements among officers resulted in that organizational structure being abandoned for a seven-member Advisory Council. Stop The Killing KC was formally incorporated on March 14, 2012, with a dedicatory "open house" April 7, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kshb.com/dpp/news/local_news/organization-opens-safe-house-to-help-tackle-violence Organization opens safe house to help tackle violence] [[KSHB-TV]], April 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In flyers publicizing the event, Stop the Killing KC lists more than seventy "partners" as being supportive in a "Stop The Killing KC [[Coalition]]":

==Incidents==
On May 14, 2012 a Kansas City woman named Andrea Shields was murdered and her body then set on fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.issuu.com/120525164057-30734a12318343e3b3107c8ddcf475d8/jpg/page_1.jpg Police Identify Woman Brutally Murdered And Set On Fire]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} [[The Call (Kansas City)]], May 25–31, 2012 edition&lt;/ref&gt;  Stop the Killing KC and other anti-violence organizations held vigils for and coordinated funeral arrangements for Shields. The funeral was scheduled for 2 p.m. Saturday May 26, 2012. Shortly after 4 a.m. that morning a drive-by shooter fired eight bullets toward Stop the Killing KC's headquarters building, seven rounds lodging in a vehicle parked in  front of the building, one round chipping siding near the building's "Stop the Killing KC" sign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fox4kc.com/2012/05/26/crime-fighting-organization-receives-threats Crime Fighting Organization Receives Threats][[WDAF-TV]], May 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, someone phoned Kansas City's "Tips Hotline" the day before, and demanded that Stop the Killing KC '"back off from the Andrea Shields investigation"'.  Because Stop The Killing KC is a "Crime Prevention" and pro-[[Civil Rights]] organization, Federal Law Enforcement agencies are investigating the incident along with Kansas City police.

'''Induction''' is the support and guidance provided to novice [[teacher]]s and school administrators in the early stages of their careers. Induction encompasses orientation to the workplace, socialization, [[mentoring]], and guidance through beginning teacher practice.

Comprehensive, high-quality induction consists of several key elements:
* a multi-year program
* rigorous mentor selection and training
* subject-area pairing of mentors and beginning educators
* sufficient time for mentors to meet with and observe new educators
* [[formative assessment]] that assists beginning educators to advance along a continuum of professional growth.

The [[New Teacher Center]] induction model is nationally recognized in the United States for its promotion of new educator development and its impact on teacher retention and student learning.

'''Teaching for Change''' is a non-profit organization founded in 1989 and based in Washington D.C. with the motto of "building social justice, starting in the classroom." This organization uses publications, professional development, and parent organizing programs to accomplish this goal.

==Programming==

Teaching for Change coordinates a variety of programs that aim to encourage teachers, students, and parents to build a more equitable, multicultural society through education.

===Tellin' Stories===
The Tellin' Stories program is a process for building parent engagement in schools. This program uses a bottom-up approach, encouraging parents to define what their roles will be.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rethinkingschools.org/articles/tellin-stories-finding-common-ground "Tellin Stories, Finding Common Ground" By David Levine, Rethinking Schools, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The training plan has four stages:
* Community Building: families meet each other and learn about their schools;
* Information Gathering: parents analyze the school climate, the facilities, and the quality of teaching and learning at their school;
* Identifying and Prioritizing Concerns: parents investigate concerns with schools (using Right Question Project methodology); and
* Taking Action: parents determine the action required to achieve desired results and work collectively to promote those actions.&lt;ref&gt;National Family, School, and Community Engagement Working Group, [http://www.hfrp.org/publications-resources/browse-our-publications/taking-leadership-innovating-change-profiles-in-family-school-and-community-engagement Taking Leadership/Innovating Change: Profiles in Family School and Community Engagement] Harvard Family Research Project, March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching for Change Bookstore===
Teaching for Change founded and operated an independent, non-profit bookstore &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=1320#m10680 "Teaching for Change at Busboys and Poets" in ''Shelf Awareness'', November 2, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; located inside [[Busboys and Poets]] 14th and V Streets location for ten years.&lt;ref name="Washingtonian"&gt;Todd Kliman, [http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/restaurants/1785.html Rainbow Room: The Busboys and Poets Controversy], ''Washingtonian'', December 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The bookstore hosted author events and provided vetted selections of books focusing on progressive politics, multicultural lessons for pre K-12, and [[people's history]]. Teaching for Change helped bring noted authors to host readings, discussions and book signings, including [[Alice Walker]], [[Howard Zinn]], [[Cornel West]], [[Ronald Takaki]], [[Michelle Alexander]], [[Melissa Harris-Perry]], [[John Sayles]], [[Nikki Giovanni]], [[Robert Parris Moses]], [[Juan Gonzalez (journalist)|Juan Gonzalez]], [[Ralph Nader]], [[Taylor Branch]], [[Dave Zirin]], [[Naomi Klein]], [[Tariq Ali]], [[Clarence Lusane]], [[Marita Golden]], [[Charles E. Cobb Jr.]], [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Edwidge Danticat]], [[Judy Richardson]], and [[Junot Diaz]]. Teaching for Change closed its bookstore in April 2015 and shared its recommendations for books online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/03/18/teaching-for-change-moves-online-amid-challenges-for-diversity-in-books/ "Teaching for Change Moves Online Amid Challenges for Diversity in Books" by Stacia Brown in ''The Washington Post'', March 18, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zinn Education Project===
Teaching for Change co-founded the Zinn Education Project with Rethinking Schools in 2008 to provide teachers with free resources to help teach a [[people's history]] including free downloadable lesson plans as a companion to [[Howard Zinn]]'s ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'' and other classroom resources for educators around the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yesmagazine.org/EdConnectionNews/may10/default.html "''Yes!Magazine'' recommends the Zinn Education Project", May, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Rights Teaching===
Beginning in 2006, Teaching for Change worked with the [[McComb School District]] and the [[Mississippi Department of Education]] for ten years to incorporate lessons on the [[civil rights movement]] and [[Labor history of the United States|labor history]] in the curriculum. The stated intention was to help schools "end a decades-old culture of silence" on difficult historical events in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Carmen K. Sisson, [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2009/1008/p25s02-usgn.html Mississippi mandates civil rights classes in schools] ''Christian Science Monitor'', October 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.good.is/articles/these-mississippi-teens-should-school-the-supreme-court-on-the-voting-rights-act|title=These Mississippi Teens Should School the Supreme Court on the Voting Rights Act|date=2013-03-12|work=GOOD Magazine|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; McComb Legacies, an after-school and summer enrichment program, grew out of the partnership between Teaching for Change and the McComb School District. As part of McComb Legacies, high school students work as historians to uncover the history of the voting rights struggle in McComb and [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hechingerreport.org/lessons-mississippis-violent-past-become-optional/|title=Have lessons about Mississippi’s violent past become optional?  - The Hechinger Report|date=2014-06-22|work=The Hechinger Report|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 2013, two McComb student projects made it to the national level of the [[National History Day]] competition. ''The Voting Rights Struggle'', a documentary film created by McComb students, tells the story of the first [[SNCC]] voter registration drive, which was located in McComb.&lt;ref&gt;Titus Ledbetter III, [https://archive.is/20130629093411/http://www.afro.com/sections/news/washington/story.htm?storyid=78857 Mississippi Students Take Award-Winning Voting Rights Documentary to Nation's Capital] AFRO, June 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The film can now be seen at the [[African American Civil War Museum]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Barfield Berry, [http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2013306130035&amp;nclick_check=1|Students showcase civil rights work] ''Jackson Clarion-Ledger'', June 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the 1980s, with a growing Central American population and U.S. involvement in the region, 11 committees of educators and community leaders formed across the country to assess how to address the needs of Central American students and increase public awareness about U.S. foreign policy in [[Central America]]. These committees convened in Los Angeles to form a national organization, the Network of Educator’s Committees on Central America (NECCA) that became incorporated in December 1989&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingforchange.org/about/history/25-years History] Teaching for Change website, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the early 90s they produced teaching resources on [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]] and hosted teacher workshops around the country based on the book ''Rethinking Columbus''.&lt;ref&gt;Rethinking Columbus, http://www.rethinkingschools.org/ProdDetails.asp?ID=094296120X Rethinking Schools.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, NECCA won the Humanities award from the DC Humanities Council and in 1994 they launched a mail order catalog for progressive teaching resources.

As the organization expanded its focus, NECCA changed its name to Teaching for Change.  Through the 1990s, Teaching for Change organized seminars for educators on social justice education topics and published their own teaching guide, ''Beyond Heroes and Holidays: A Practical Guide to K-12 Anti-Racist, Multicultural Education and Staff Development''.

In 1999, Teaching for Change hosted a seminar for educators in the DC area focusing on "putting the movement back into Civil Rights" history teaching at [[Howard University]]. That seminar led to the production of a teaching guide with the same name, in collaboration with the Poverty and Race Resource Action Council (PRRAC).

''Putting the Movement Back into Civil Rights Teaching'' won the Philip C. Chinn book of the year award &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nameorg.org/philip_chinn_book_award.php|title=Philip Chinn Book Award - National Association for Multicultural Education|website=nameorg.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Teaching for Change won the National Association for Multicultural Education Organization of the Year in 2004.

In 2005, Teaching for Change was invited by former board member and entrepreneur [[Andy Shallal]] to open a bookstore in [[Busboys and Poets]].

In 2008, in partnership with Rethinking Schools, they launched the Zinn Education Project to provide middle and high school teachers with free access to lessons for [[Howard Zinn]]’s ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'' and other people's history resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/summer17/bringing-zinn-to-class/|title=Bringing Zinn to Class|last=|first=|date=|website=Bostonia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Teaching for Change was attacked by [[Rush Limbaugh]] who said of the organization, "it’s racist, it’s bigoted." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://origin-www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2014/06/16/rush_revere_books_dissed_on_c_span2/|title=Rush Revere Books Dissed on C-SPAN2|work=The Rush Limbaugh Show|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bookweb.org/news/teaching-change-supporters-react-limbaugh-slam|title=Teaching for Change, Supporters React to Limbaugh Slam|date=2014-06-19|work=American Booksellers Association|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/city-desk/blog/13068736/rush-limbaugh-attacks-the-bookstore-at-busboys-and-poets|title=Rush Limbaugh Attacks the Bookstore at Busboys and Poets|work=Washington City Paper|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching for Change launched the Teach the Beat initiative &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tmottgogo.com/teach-the-beat-go-go-goes-to-school-artists-and-scholars-in-the-classroom-sept-29-2015-video/|title=Teach the Beat: Go-Go Goes to School: Artists and Scholars in the Classroom|last=|first=|date=2015-10-15|work=TMOTT GO GO Magazine|access-date=2017-08-21|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to bring [[go-go]] artists to D.C. classrooms and was among the national recipients of the [[W.

'''The World Museum''' was a [[full page|full-page]] [[Sunday strip|illustrated feature]] in some American [[Sunday comics|Sunday newspapers]], starting in June 1937 until January 1938. Devised and drawn by [[Holling C. Holling|Holling Clancy Holling]] (1900–1973), it was also known as '''The World Museum Dioramas'''.&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement - Evening Star - May 08, 1937, Page C-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Evening Star in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and the Baltimore American both published the dioramas.&lt;ref name="Coronation"&gt;The Coronation of King George the Sixth and Queen Elizabeth - Evening Star - May 09, 1937 - Page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement - The Midland Journal - May 21, 1937 - page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Publication in the Evening Star abruptly stops in February 1938 in spite of the next diorama, ''Log Cabin Days'' (scheduled for February 6, 1938) being announced in the January 30, 1938 issue along with ''Roman Gladiators''. No announcement of the cancellation seems to have been done. &lt;ref name="AmericanDesert"&gt;American Desert - Evening Star [volume], January 30, 1938, Page 3, Image 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Each diorama was published in the Sunday edition and occupied a full page in color. It featured all the parts to be cut out by the reader with detailed instructions to cut out the pictures and assemble them into a [[diorama]] using wrapping paper to stiffen the strucutre. Each new diorama had a paragraph explaining the diorama itself from a historical or geographical point of view. Subject included historical events, natural wonders or international ethnographic scenes.&lt;ref name="Coronation"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1443">'''Travel health nursing''' is an emerging [[nurse|nursing]] specialty that promotes the health and safety of national and international travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ATHNA: Travel Health Nursing Fact Sheet |url=http://www.athna.org/about/factSheet.asp |website=www.athna.org |accessdate=2 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to [[travel medicine]], it is an interdisciplinary practice which draws from the knowledge bases of [[vaccines]], [[epidemiology]], [[tropical medicine]], [[public health]] and [[health education]].
==Roles and Workplaces==
Travel health nurses primarily work in travel health clinics, the [[military]], the [[government]], and some large [[ambulatory care]] practices. Their work covers pre-travel care, with a focus on disease prevention and health promotion while patients are away from their home. Travel health nurses assess the potential traveler's health and their destination risks in order to implement a plan of preventive care that can include immunizations and travel [[medications]] and supplies. These nurses offer health counseling and education for prospective travelers along with education regarding how to manage their chronic conditions while away from home. Often, referrals for care during travel is provided either for anticipated needs or in case of a health emergency.

The player drives a car through the city, performing missions for money while taking care not to break traffic rules; a later update also added a driving school simulation.

''Urban Jungle'' is the first educational driving game made in Croatia. The development started in June 2002; a total of 40 people worked on the project, which was financed through grants and [[in-game advertising]]. The game was previewed in November 2005 and published by Autoklub Rijeka and Talented Programmers Association of Rijeka (DIR) the following month. The game saw use as a tool to promote safe driving by the Croatian authorities. In 2013, a sequel was announced, but it was reported to be still in development by the end of 2016.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Urban Jungle (video game) - Inside the car (adamiceva iz auta).jpg|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot. The player is driving through Rijeka city centre.]]
The player drives a car through Rijeka,&lt;ref name="index.hr 2005"/&gt; performing time-limited missions.&lt;ref name="game instructions v1.00"&gt;{{cite web|title=Upute - Urban Jungle 1.00|url=http://urbanjungle.dir.hr/upute.php|website=Urban Jungle|publisher=DIR|accessdate=15 July 2017|language=hr|date=3 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; After each completed mission, they are rewarded with money and penalised for breaking traffic laws. If enough in-game money is accrued, it is possible to buy better cars.&lt;ref name="index.hr 2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Igra Urban Jungle - prva cestovna simulacija u Hrvatskoj|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/igra-urban-jungle--prva-cestovna-simulacija-u-hrvatskoj/293535.aspx|website=[[Index.hr]]|accessdate=27 December 2016|language=hr|date=8 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money can also be spent on fuel, repairs of damage resulting from crashes, and traffic infractions.&lt;ref name="game instructions v1.00" /&gt; The player must be careful not to hit pedestrians, which are, in order to avoid graphic violence, represented by [[crash test dummy|crash test dummies]].&lt;ref name="rijeka.hr prerelease"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Šehović|first1=J.|title=Predstavljen projekt "Urban Jungle" -  cestovne prometne simulacije|url=http://www.rijeka.hr/default.aspx?art=4011&amp;sec=340|publisher=City of Rijeka|accessdate=27 December 2016|language=hr|date=24 November 2005}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player accumulates too much damage on their car or too many [[point system (driving)|penalty points]], or hits a police officer, the game ends.&lt;ref name="game instructions v1.00" /&gt;

A [[driver's education]] mode was added to the game in a 2007 update, entitled ''Urban Jungle: Autoškola v1.1'' (''autoškola'' means "driving school" in [[Croatian language|Croatian]]). The player has to complete driving exams at a test track before being allowed to undertake driving missions. The update also featured more detailed graphics, a renewed car pool and more complicated missions.&lt;ref name="bug.hr driving school"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radešić|first1=Damir|title=Urban Jungle: Auto škola|url=http://www.bug.hr/master/vijesti/urban-jungle-auto-skola/84130.aspx|website=[[BUG (magazine)|BUG Online]]|accessdate=27 December 2016|language=hr|date=19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers also added weather, the ability to go sightseeing in-game as a pedestrian, the ability to receive insurance reimbursement for damage caused by non-player cars, and the ability to purchase a new vehicle through a bank loan.&lt;ref name="jutarnji v1.1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orlić|first1=Gordan|title=Urban Jungle: Auto škola zakrpa v1.1|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/gameland/igre/urban-jungle-auto-skola-zakrpa-v1.1/3653439/|website=[[Jutarnji list]]|accessdate=27 December 2016|location=Zagreb|language=hr|date=18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The development of ''Urban Jungle'' started in June 2002.&lt;ref name="rijeka.hr prerelease" /&gt; The game was financed through [[in-game advertising]] by local and foreign companies and nonprofit organisations such as [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref name="rijeka.hr prerelease" /&gt; It also received funds from the government of the City of Rijeka.&lt;ref name="rijeka city funds"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Plan raspodjele sredstava za programe javnih potreba u tehničkoj kulturi Grada Rijeke za 2009. godinu|journal=Službene novine Primorsko-goranske županije|date=19 December 2008|volume=XVI|issue=51|url=http://www.sn.pgz.hr/default.asp?Link=odluke&amp;id=15772|accessdate=27 December 2016|publisher=City of Rijeka|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 40 people worked on the project. The game programmers built their own [[3D engine]], Urban3D.&lt;ref name="novi list uj 2"/&gt; Parts of the game, including 3D models and some of the textures, were designed on [[Macintosh|Mac]] computers. There were plans to port the game to Mac OS X, which were abandoned with Apple's transition to [[x86]] architecture.&lt;ref name="pasarić interview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kapsalis|first1=Roberta|title=Interview - Davor Pasarić s prijateljskog Jabučnjaka|url=http://www.mackorisnik.com/2008/11/22/interview-davor-pasaric-s-prijateljskog-jabucnjaka/|website=MacKorisnik.com|accessdate=13 July 2017|language=hr|date=22 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006012237/http://www.mackorisnik.com/2008/11/22/interview-davor-pasaric-s-prijateljskog-jabucnjaka/|archivedate=6 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lafayette College admissions department waitlist letter.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Colleges use waitlists to hedge their bets, uncertain about how many accepted students will say yes, and to draw applicants from the waitlist when vacancies open. In addition, waitlists allow colleges to target acceptance letters to students likely to attend to maintain the college's selectivity ranking and [[Yield (college admissions)|yield]].]]
'''Wait list''', in [[university and college admissions]], is a term used in the United States and other countries to describe a situation in which a college or university has not formally accepted a particular student for admission, but at the same time may offer admission in the next few months if spaces become available.&lt;ref name=twsL14&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a contingent offer only, and may mean an offer of admission in the future, or it may not, depending on circumstances. It has been described as a type of college admissions "purgatory",&lt;ref name=twsZe19/&gt; or being held in "the higher-ed equivalent of limbo".&lt;ref name=twsZe21&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percent of applicants offered admission, who decide to accept, is known as the ''admissions yield'',&lt;ref name=twsZe23&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this proportion varies somewhat from year to year, and reflects economic conditions as well as interest in a given university. 

Colleges mailing out wait list offers generally advise students to reserve a spot at a college they have been accepted to by sending in a deposit, usually several hundred dollars&lt;ref&gt;Note: the deposit varies with the college&lt;/ref&gt; to guarantee that the student will have a place at any college in the fall. Later, if a student is accepted by a college from a wait list, and if he or she chooses to accept the wait list offer, it usually entails sacrificing that earlier deposit. In the [[United States]], for students applying by regular admission, the month of April is a time when much activity happens; colleges email offers of acceptance and rejection, and students select a college by sending a deposit. In May, after receiving deposits, colleges know how many spots will be open, and will usually begin to offer admission to students on their wait lists as positions become open. Students can be offered admission from the wait list during May and June and throughout the summer.

According to several reports, colleges and universities use wait lists to try to hedge their guesses about how many students will ultimately decide to accept their offers of admission in any given academic year, with the idea being to build "a reservoir of qualified students to draw from to replace successful applicants who choose to go elsewhere."&lt;ref name=twsZe22/&gt; If fewer students say yes, then colleges will often go to their wait lists to try to find replacements.&lt;ref name=twsL14/&gt; In 2010, according to one source, roughly 10% of college applicants were put on a wait list.&lt;ref name=twsZe19&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2011-12-31
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wait lists tend to be used by elite and selective universities as well as second-tier liberal arts colleges who are uncertain about how many students will show up in the fall; for example, [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] put 1,000 students on their wait lists and [[Duke University|Duke]] put 3,000 on their wait list, according to one report in 2010.&lt;ref name=twsZe21/&gt; [[Amherst College|Amherst]] takes 35 students from the 1,000 students on its wait list.&lt;ref name=twsZe22/&gt; And as a general rule, selective colleges and universities will usually have some form of wait list. Of the students on a wait list at a highly selective school, a fraction may be offered admission before classes begin in late August or September. One report said the fraction of wait-listed students who were eventually offered admission&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;as an average of all students wait listed in a given year&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;was 30%,&lt;ref name=twsZe21/&gt; but this is an overall average, and the fraction of wait-listed applicants to prestigious universities, who are eventually admitted, is much less. Students who are wait-listed can take steps to improve their chances of admission from a wait list by writing letters of interest and by sending second-semester senior grades.&lt;ref name=twsZe22&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2011-12-31
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wait listed students are ranked by the admissions department in terms of overall desirability, based on the college's estimation of admissions criteria, and more highly ranked waitlisted students are offered admission first when spots open; this ranking is not revealed to the public.

The '''Youth for Heritage Foundation''' is a non-profit non-governmental organization registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. It was started as a hobby project in October 2009 and became popular over time.

==History==
In October 2009, [[Vikramjit Singh Rooprai]], an information technology consultant and social media guru went on a personal site-seeing trip to monuments in Delhi. He found many sites, for which, there was no reference available online. He launched a project named Didar-i-Dilli and started gathering information about Delhi's heritage. The information was made public via his website [http://www.monumentsofdelhi.com monumentsofdelhi.com] later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/299132/delhiites-take-walks-big-way.html|title=Delhiites take to walks in a big way|author=|date=|work=Deccan Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Vikramjit formed an online club named Delhi Heritage Awareness Club. This club started heritage walks with a small group of people. Upon suggestions from members, the club was renamed The Heritage Photography Club. In less than 7 years, they had 21,000 members on Facebook and became one of the largest repository of photographs of monuments from across India.

In 2013, the Heritage Photography Club started organizing heritage talks at monuments. These talks were branded Heritage Durbars. Initially, these durbars (sessions) were held at various monuments in Delhi. In 2014, the club was invited by [[India Habitat Centre]] to conduct these sessions at one of their auditoriums. In 2014, the body was registered under the Societies Registration Act as Youth for Heritage Foundation. Rooprai was the founding chairman.
