'''Always already''' is a philosophical term regarding the perception of phenomena by the mind of an observer. The features of a phenomenon that seem to precede any perception of it are said to be "always already" present.

==Development==
"Always already" literally translates the German phrase ''immer schon'' that appears prominently in several 20th century philosophical works, notably [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]''. The phrase is not specific to philosophy in German, but refers to an action or condition that has continued without any identifiable beginning. Heidegger used the phrase routinely to indicate that [[Dasein]], the human experience of existence, has no beginning apart from the world in which one exists, but is produced in it and by it.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Hubert L. and Mark A. Wrathal (2008) ''A Companion to Heidegger'', p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

On the strength of Heidegger's influence, French and later English philosophers adopted the literal translation of the phrase. In the Marxist tradition, [[Louis Althusser]] observed that "individuals are always-already subjects" within an ideological structure before they perceive themselves as such — indeed, even before birth.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, Louis (1970) "[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1970/ideology.htm Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses]"&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 20th century the term spread into various areas of philosophical discourse that include [[literary theory]], [[hermeneutics]] and [[deconstruction]].

In [[Buddhism]], the term '''anattā''' ([[Pali]]) or '''anātman''' ([[Sanskrit]]) refers to the doctrine of "non-self", that there is no unchanging, permanent self, [[soul]] or essence in living beings.&lt;ref name=britannicaanatta&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta Buddhism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210185046/http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta |date=2015-12-10 }}, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Christmas Humphreys|title=Exploring Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3rYtmCZEIEC |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-22877-3 |pages=42–43 }}&lt;br /&gt;[b] {{cite book|author=Brian Morris |title=Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PguGB_uEQh4C&amp;pg=PA51 |year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85241-8|pages=51 }}, Quote: "...anatta is the doctrine of non-self, and is an extreme empiricist doctrine that holds that the notion of an unchanging permanent self is a fiction and has no reality.

== Etymology and nomenclature ==
''Anattā'' is a composite Pali word consisting of ''an'' (not, without) and ''attā'' (soul).&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p22"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids |author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC |year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7 |pages=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to the central Buddhist doctrine that "there is in humans no permanent, underlying substance that can be called the soul."&lt;ref name=britannicaanatta /&gt; It is one of the three characteristics of all existence, together with ''[[dukkha]]'' (suffering, unsatisfactoriness) and ''[[anicca]]'' (impermanence).&lt;ref name=britannicaanatta /&gt;&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p22" /&gt;

''Anattā'' is synonymous with ''Anātman'' (an + ātman) in Sanskrit Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name=britannicaanatta /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2009p124" /&gt; In some Pali texts, ''ātman'' of Vedic texts is also referred to with the term ''Attan'', with the sense of soul.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p22" /&gt; An alternate use of ''Attan'' or ''Atta'' is "self, oneself, essence of a person", driven by the Vedic era Brahmanical belief that the soul is the permanent, unchangeable essence of a living being, or the true self.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2009p124"&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst |title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mhuabeq5-cAC |year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn= 978-0-86171-566-4|pages=124–125 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism-related English literature, ''Anattā'' is rendered as "not-Self", but this translation expresses an incomplete meaning, states [[Peter Harvey (Buddhism)|Peter Harvey]]; a more complete rendering is "non-Self" because from its earliest days, ''Anattā'' doctrine denies that there is anything called a 'Self' in any person or anything else, and that a belief in 'Self' is a source of ''Dukkha'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=57–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey| editor=Steven M.

== Anattā in early Buddhist texts ==
The concept of ''Anattā'' appears in numerous [[Sutra|Sutta]] of the ancient Buddhist [[Nikāya]] texts (Pali canon). It appears, for example, as a noun in ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'' III.141, IV.49, V.345, in Sutta II.37 of ''[[Anguttara Nikaya]]'', II.37–45 and II.80 of ''[[Patisambhidamagga]]'', III.406 of ''[[Dhammapada]]''. It also appears as an adjective, for example, in ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'' III.114, III.133, IV.28 and IV.130–166, in Sutta III.66 and V.86 of ''[[Vinaya]]''.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2009p124" /&gt;

The ancient Buddhist texts discuss ''Attā'' or ''Attan'' (soul, self), sometimes with alternate terms such as ''Atuman'', ''Tuma'', ''Puggala'', ''Jiva'', ''Satta'', ''Pana'' and ''Nama-rupa'', thereby providing the context for the Buddhist ''Anattā'' doctrine. Examples of such ''Attā'' contextual discussions are found in ''Digha Nikaya'' I.186-187, ''Samyutta Nikaya'' III.179 and IV.54, ''Vinaya'' I.14, ''Majjhima Nikaya'' I.138, III.19, and III.265–271 and ''Anguttara Nikaya'' I.284.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2009p124" /&gt;&lt;ref name=collins71&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title= Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC |year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|pages=71–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contextual use of ''Attā'' in Nikāyas  is two sided. In one, it directly denies that there is anything called a self or soul in a human being that is a permanent essence of a human being, a theme found in Brahmanical (proto-Hindu) traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=1–2, 34–40, 224–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another, states [[Peter Harvey (Buddhism)|Peter Harvey]], such as at ''Samyutta Nikaya'' IV.286, the Sutta considers the materialistic concept in pre-Buddhist Vedic times of "no afterlife, complete annihilation" at death to be a denial of Self, but still "tied up with belief in a Self".&lt;ref name=harveyp39&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Self exists" is a false premise, assert the early Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name=harveyp39 /&gt; However, adds Peter Harvey, these texts do not admit the premise "Self does not exist" either because the wording presumes the concept of "Self" prior to denying it; instead, the early Buddhist texts use the concept of ''Anattā'' as the implicit premise.&lt;ref name=harveyp39 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ|year=2009 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn= 978-0-86171-811-5|pages= 23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steven Collins, the doctrine of anatta and "denial of self" in the canonical Buddhist texts is "insisted on only in certain theoretical contexts", while they use the terms ''atta, purisa, puggala'' quite naturally and freely in various contexts.&lt;ref name=collins71/&gt; The elaboration of the anatta doctrine, along with identification of the words such as "puggala" as "permanent subject or soul" appears in later Buddhist literature.&lt;ref name=collins71/&gt;

''Anattā'' is one of the main bedrock doctrines of Buddhism, and its discussion is found in the later texts of all Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref name="Leaman2002p23"&gt;{{cite book|author= Oliver Leaman|title= Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vK-GAgAAQBAJ |year=2002|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-68919-4 |pages=23–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]] (~200 CE), extensively wrote about rejecting the metaphysical entity called ''attā'' or ''ātman'' (self, soul), asserting in chapter 18 of his ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' that there is no such substantial entity and that "Buddha taught the doctrine of no-self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nāgārjuna|author2=David J.

=== Existence and non-existence ===

While the concept of soul in Hinduism (as atman) and [[Jainism]] (as [[jiva]]) is taken for granted, which is different from the Buddhist concept of no-soul, each of the three religions believed in rebirth and emphasized moral responsibility in different ways in contrast to pre-Buddhist materialistic schools of Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name=danielkeownucchedavada /&gt;&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

=== Karma, rebirth and anattā ===
{{StagesFettersRebirths|notes=1}}
The Buddha emphasized both karma and anatta doctrines.&lt;ref name="Selves"&gt;"Selves &amp; Not-self: The Buddhist Teaching on Anatta", by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Access to Insight (Legacy Edition), 30 November 2013, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selvesnotself.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204143026/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selvesnotself.html |date=2013-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha criticized the doctrine that posited an unchanging soul as a subject as the basis of rebirth and karmic moral responsibility, which he called "atthikavāda". He also criticized the materialistic doctrine that denied the existence of both soul and rebirth, and thereby denied karmic moral responsibility, which he calls "natthikavāda".&lt;ref name="Causality 1975, page 44"&gt;[[David Kalupahana]], ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the Buddha asserted that there is no soul, but there is rebirth for which karmic moral responsibility is a must. In the Buddha's framework of karma, right view and right actions are necessary for liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm B.

=== Developing the self ===
{{Main|Buddhist Paths to liberation|Personal identity#Theories}}

According to [[Peter Harvey (Buddhism)|Peter Harvey]], while the ''Suttas'' criticize notions of an eternal, unchanging Self as baseless, they see an enlightened being as one whose empirical self is highly developed.&lt;ref name=peterharveytsm54&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is paradoxical, states Harvey, in that "the Self-like ''nibbana'' state" is a mature self that knows "everything as Selfless".&lt;ref name=peterharveytsm54 /&gt; The "empirical self" is the ''citta'' (mind/heart, mindset, emotional nature), and the development of self in the Suttas is the development of this ''citta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Peter Harvey| title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ| year=1995| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One with "great self", state the early Buddhist ''Suttas'', has a mind which is neither at the mercy of outside stimuli nor its own moods, neither scattered nor diffused, but imbued with self-control, and self-contained towards the single goal of ''nibbana'' and a 'Self-like' state.&lt;ref name=peterharveytsm54 /&gt; This "great self" is not yet an ''Arahat'', because he still does small evil action which leads to karmic fruition, but he has enough virtue that he does not experience this fruition in hell.&lt;ref name=peterharveytsm54 /&gt;

An ''Arahat'', states Harvey, has a fully enlightened state of empirical self, one that lacks the "sense of both 'I am' and 'this I am'", which are illusions that the ''Arahat'' has transcended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=31–32, 44, 50–51, 71, 210–216, 246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist thought and salvation theory emphasizes a development of self towards a Selfless state not only with respect to oneself, but recognizing the lack of relational essence and Self in others, wherein states Martijn van Zomeren, "self is an illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Martijn van Zomeren| title=From Self to Social Relationships: An Essentially Relational Perspective on Social Motivation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXkZDAAAQBAJ| year=2016| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-1-107-09379-9| page=156}}, '''Quote:''' Buddhism is an example of a non-theistic religion, which underlies a cultural matrix in which individuals believe that the self is an illusion. Indeed, its anatta doctrine states that the self is not an essence.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anatman in Theravada Buddhism ==
[[Theravada Buddhism]] scholars, states [[Oliver Leaman]], consider the ''Anattā'' doctrine as one of the main theses of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Leaman2002p23" /&gt;

The Buddhist denial of "any Soul or Self" is what distinguishes Buddhism from major religions of the world such as Christianity and Hinduism, giving it uniqueness, asserts the Theravada tradition.&lt;ref name="Leaman2002p23" /&gt; With the doctrine of  ''Anattā'', stands or falls the entire Buddhist structure, asserts [[Nyanatiloka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC&amp;pg=PA5|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Collins," insight into the teaching of anatta is held to have two major loci in the intellectual and spiritual education of an individual" as s/he progresses along [[Noble Eightfold Path|the Path]].&lt;ref name=stevecollins94/&gt; The first part of this insight is to avoid ''sakkayaditthi'' (Personality Belief), that is converting the "sense of I which is gained from introspection and the fact of physical individuality" into a theoretical belief in a self.&lt;ref name=stevecollins94/&gt; 'A belief in a (really) existing body' is considered a false belief and a part of the Ten Fetters that must be gradually lost. The second loci is the psychological realisation of anatta, or loss of 'pride or conceit'. This, states Collins, is explained as the conceit of ''asmimana'' or 'I am'; (...) what this 'conceit' refers to is the fact that for the unenlightened man, all experience and action must necessarily appear phenomenologically as happening to or originating from an 'I'.&lt;ref name=stevecollins94/&gt; When a Buddhist gets more enlightened, this happening to or originating in an 'I' or sakkdyaditthi is less. The final attainment of enlightenment is the disappearance of this automatic but illusory 'I'.&lt;ref name=stevecollins94&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC |year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theravada tradition has long considered the understanding and application of the ''Anatta'' doctrine to a complex teaching, whose "personal, introjected application has always been thought to be possible only for the specialist, the practising monk". The tradition, states Collins, has "insisted fiercely on anatta as a doctrinal position", while in practice it may not play much of a role in the daily religious life of most Buddhists.&lt;ref name=stevecollins95&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC |year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|pages=94–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Suttas present the doctrine in three forms. First, they apply the "no-self, no-identity" doctrine to all phenomena as well as any and all objects, yielding the idea that "all things are not-self" (''sabbe dhamma anatta'').&lt;ref name=stevecollins95 /&gt; Second, states Collins, the Suttas apply the doctrine to deny self of any person, treating conceit to be evident in any assertion of "this is mine, this I am, this is myself" (''etam mamam eso 'ham asmi, eso me atta ti'').&lt;ref name=stevecollins96&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC&amp;pg=PA5|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, the Theravada texts apply the doctrine as a nominal reference, to identify examples of "self" and "not-self", respectively the Wrong view and the Right view; this third case of nominative usage is properly translated as "self" (as an identity) and is unrelated to "soul", states Collins.&lt;ref name=stevecollins96 /&gt; The first two usages incorporate the idea of soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC&amp;pg=PA5|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|pages=3–5, 35–36, 109–116, 163, 193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravada doctrine of ''Anatta'', or not-self not-soul, inspire meditative practices for monks, states Donald Swearer, but for the lay Theravada Buddhists in Southeast Asia, the doctrines of ''[[Karma|kamma]]'', [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and ''punna'' (merit) inspire a wide range of ritual practices and ethical behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald K.

The ''Anatta'' doctrine is key to the concept of [[nirvana]] (nibbana) in the Theravada tradition. The liberated nirvana state, states Collins, is the state of ''Anatta'', a state that is neither universally applicable nor can be explained, but can be realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC&amp;pg=PA5|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|This is a major difference between the Theravada Buddhists and different Hindu traditions which assert that nirvana is realizing and being in the state of self (soul, atman) and is universally applicable.

=== Current disputes ===
{{See also|Buddhism in Thailand}}
The dispute about "self" and "not-self" doctrines has continued throughout the history of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Potprecha Cholvijarn|title=Nibbāna as True Reality beyond the Debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkXJVKnjw3kC|publisher=Wat Luang Phor Sodh|isbn=978-974-350-263-7|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is possible, states [[Johannes Bronkhorst]], that "original Buddhism did not deny the existence of the soul", even though a firm Buddhist tradition has maintained that the Buddha avoided talking about the soul or even denied its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AZbZDP8MRJoC|year=1993|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1114-0 |pages=99 with footnote 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, adds Bronkhorst, it is clear from these texts that seeking self-knowledge is not the Buddhist path for liberation, and turning away from self-knowledge is.&lt;ref name=bronkhorst25 /&gt; This is a reverse position to the Vedic traditions which recognized the knowledge of the self as "the principal means to achieving liberation".&lt;ref name=bronkhorst25&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn= 978-0-86171-811-5|pages= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thai Theravada Buddhism, for example, states [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]], some modern era Buddhist scholars have claimed that "nirvana is indeed the true Self", while other Thai Buddhists disagree.{{sfn|Williams|2008|pp=125–7}} For instance, the [[Dhammakaya Movement]] in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of ''anatta'' (non-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the "true self" or ''[[Dharmakaya|dhammakaya]]''.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=100–5, 110}} The Dhammakaya Movement teaching that nirvana is [[Atman (Buddhism)|atta]], or true self, was criticized as heretical in Buddhism in the 1994 by [[Prayudh Payutto|Ven. Payutto]], a well-known scholar monk, who stated that 'Buddha taught nibbana as being non-self".{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=51}}{{Sfn|Williams|2008|p=127-128}} The abbot of one major temple in the Dhammakaya Movement, Luang Por Sermchai of [[Dhammakaya Movement#Wat Luang Phor Sodh Dhammakayaram|Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram]], argues that it tends to be scholars who hold the view of absolute non-self, rather than Buddhist meditation practitioners. He points to the experiences of prominent forest hermit monks to support the notion of a "true self".{{Sfn|Williams|2008|p=127-128}} Similar interpretations on the "true self" were put forth earlier by the 12th [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand]] in 1939.

Scholars Alexander Wynne and Rupert Gethin also take a similar position as Thanissaro Bhikkhu, arguing that the Buddha's description of non-self in the five aggregates do not necessarily mean there is no self, stating that the five aggregates are not descriptions of a human being but phenomena for one to observe.

Nagarjuna, the founder of Madhyamaka (middle way) school of Mahayana Buddhism, analyzed [[dharma]] first as factors of experience.&lt;ref name=kalupahana56 /&gt; He, states David Kalupahana, analyzed how these experiences relate to "bondage and freedom, action and consequence", and thereafter analyzed the notion of personal self (''attā'', ''ātman'').&lt;ref name=kalupahana56&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nāgārjuna|author2=David J.

The early Mahayana Buddhism texts link their discussion of "emptiness" (''shunyata'') to ''Anatta'' and ''Nirvana''. They do so, states Mun-Keat Choong, in three ways: first, in the common sense of a monk's meditative state of emptiness; second, with the main sense of ''Anatta'' or 'everything in the world is empty of self'; third, with the ultimate sense of ''Nirvana'' or realization of emptiness and thus an end to rebirth cycles of suffering.&lt;ref name="Choong1999p85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mun-Keat Choong|title=The Notion of Emptiness in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJafx7uO0VsC| year=1999| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass| isbn=978-81-208-1649-7| pages=1–4, 85–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anatta doctrine is another aspect of ''shunyata'', its realization is the nature of the ''nirvana'' state and to an end to rebirths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ray Billington|title= Understanding Eastern Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dACFAgAAQBAJ |year=2002|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-79348-8 |pages=58–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Loy|title=Awareness Bound and Unbound: Buddhist Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5KHnVVjwKQC |year=2009|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-2680-8 |pages=35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Stephan Schuhmacher|title= The Encyclopedia of Eastern Philosophy and Religion: Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Zen| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpP8770qVakC| year =1994|publisher= Shambhala|isbn =978-0-87773-980-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its soteriological themes, Buddhism has defined [[nirvana]] as that blissful state when a person, amongst other things, realizes that he or she has "no self, no soul".&lt;ref name=6sourcesatman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 23, Issue 1, pages 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditions within Hinduism believe in [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]. The pre-Buddhist [[Upanishads]] of Hinduism assert that there is a permanent ''Atman'', and is an ultimate metaphysical reality.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p34"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=34, 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ling1969p86"/&gt; This sense of self, is expressed as "I am" in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.1, states Peter Harvey, when nothing existed before the start of the universe.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p34" /&gt; The Upanishadic scriptures hold that this soul or self is underlying the whole world.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p34" /&gt; At the core of all human beings and living creatures, assert the Hindu traditions, there is "eternal, innermost essential and absolute something called a soul, self that is atman."&lt;ref name=6sourcesatman /&gt; Within the diverse [[Hindu philosophy|schools of Hinduism]], there are differences of perspective on whether souls are distinct, whether Supreme Soul or God exists, whether the nature of Atman is dual or non-dual, and how to reach [[moksha]]. However, despite their internal differences, one shared foundational premise of Hinduism is that "soul, self exists", and that there is bliss in seeking this self, knowing self, and self-realization.&lt;ref name=6sourcesatman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sengaku Mayeda (2000), Sankara and Buddhism, in New Perspectives on Advaita Vedānta (Editors: Richard V.

{{Quote|
While the ''[[Upanishad]]s'' recognized many things as being not-Self, they felt that a real, true Self could be found. They held that when it was found, and known to be identical to Brahman, the basis of everything, this would bring liberation. In the Buddhist ''[[Buddhist texts|Suttas]]'', though, literally everything is seen is non-Self, even [[Nirvana]]. When this is known, then liberation – ''Nirvana'' – is attained by total non-attachment. Thus both the ''Upanishads'' and the Buddhist ''Suttas'' see many things as not-Self, but the Suttas apply it, indeed non-Self, to ''everything''.

Both Buddhism and Hinduism distinguish ego-related "I am, this is mine", from their respective abstract doctrines of "Anatta" and "Atman".&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p34" /&gt; This, states Peter Harvey, may have been an influence of Buddhism on Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|page=34}}, '''Quote:''' "The post-Buddhist Matri Upanishad holds that only defiled individual self, rather than the universal one, thinks 'this is I' or 'this is mine'. This is very reminiscent of Buddhism, and may well have been influenced by it to divorce the universal Self from such egocentric associations".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anatman and Niratman===
The term ''niratman'' appears in the ''[[Maitrayaniya Upanishad]]'' of Hinduism, such as in verses 6.20, 6.21 and 7.4. ''Niratman'' literally means "selfless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title= Sixty Upanishads of the Veda| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|authorlink=Paul Deussen|year=1980|page=361|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood1992p67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas E.

In the Upanishad, states Thomas Wood, numerous positive and negative descriptions of various states – such as ''niratman'' and ''sarvasyatman'' (the self of all) – are used in ''Maitrayaniya Upanishad'' to explain the nondual concept of the "highest Self".&lt;ref name="Wood1992p67"/&gt; According to Ramatirtha, states Paul Deussen, the ''niratman'' state discussion is referring to stopping the recognition of oneself as an individual soul, and reaching the awareness of universal soul or the metaphysical [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title= Sixty Upanishads of the Veda| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|authorlink=Paul Deussen|year=1980|pages=358-359 introductory note, 361 with footnote 1, 380|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artha''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|t|ə|,_|-|θ|ə}}; {{lang-sa|अर्थ}}) is one of the four aims of human life in Indian philosophy.&lt;ref name=jamesl&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''artha'' literally translates as "meaning, sense, goal, purpose or essence" depending on the context.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* [http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=artha&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 Sanskrit English Dictionary] University of Kloen, Germany (2009)
* Karl Potter (1998), Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 3, {{ISBN|81-208-0310-8}}, Motilal Banarsidass, pp 610 (note 17)&lt;/ref&gt; Artha is also a broader concept in the scriptures of [[Hinduism]]. As a concept, it has multiple meanings, all of which imply "means of life", activities and resources that enable one to be in a state one wants to be in.&lt;ref name=johnk&gt;John Koller, Puruṣārtha as Human Aims, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 18, No. 4 (Oct., 1968), pp. 315–319&lt;/ref&gt;

Artha applies to both an individual and a government. In an individual's context, ''artha'' includes wealth, career, activity to make a living, financial security and economic prosperity. The proper pursuit of artha is considered an important aim of human life in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jamesl/&gt;&lt;ref name=bruces&gt;Bruce Sullivan (1997), Historical Dictionary of Hinduism, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-3327-2}}, pp 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; At government level, ''artha'' includes social, legal, economic and worldly affairs. Proper [[Arthashastra]] is considered an important and necessary objective of government.&lt;ref name=bruces/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constance Jones and James Ryan (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism, {{ISBN|978-0-8160-5458-9}}, pp 45&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindu traditions, Artha is connected to the three other aspects and goals of human life: [[Dharma]] (virtuous, proper, moral life), [[Kama]] (pleasure, sensuality, emotional fulfillment) and [[Moksha]] (liberation, release, self-actualization). Together, these mutually non-exclusive four aims of life are called [[Puruṣārtha]].&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;"Artha" in Encyclopædia Britannica, Chicago, 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:

==Definition and meaning==
Artha as a concept includes multiple meanings. It is difficult to capture the meaning of artha, or related terms of ''dharma'', ''kama'' and ''moksha'', each in a single English word.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in [[Julius Lipner]] (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, {{ISBN|978-1-896209-30-2}}, paragraph overlapping pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

John Lochtefeld describes&lt;ref name=jamesl/&gt; ''artha'' as the means of life, and includes material prosperity. Karl Potter explains&lt;ref name=karlp&gt;Karl H. Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0779-2}}, pp. 1–29&lt;/ref&gt; it as an attitude and capability that enables one to make a living, to remain alive, to thrive as a free person. It includes economic prosperity, security and health of oneself and those one feels responsible for.&lt;ref name=swsk/&gt; Artha includes everything in one's environment that allows one to live. It is neither an end state nor an endless goal of aimlessly amassing money, claims Karl Potter,&lt;ref name=karlp/&gt; rather it is an attitude and necessary requirement of human life. John Koller takes&lt;ref name=johnk/&gt; a different viewpoint than Karl Potter's interpretation. John Koller suggests artha is not an attitude, rather it is one of the necessities of human life. A central premise of Hindu philosophy, claims Koller, is that every person should live a joyous and pleasurable life, that such fulfilling life requires every person's needs and desires be acknowledged and fulfilled, that needs can only be satisfied through activity and when sufficient means for those activities are available. Artha, then, is best described as pursuit of activities and means necessary for a joyous and pleasurable life.&lt;ref name=johnk/&gt;

[[Daya Krishna]] argues&lt;ref name=dayak&gt;Daya Krishna, The myth of the purusarthas, in Theory of Value (Editor: Roy Perrett), Volume 5, Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|0-8153-3612-8}}, pp 11–24&lt;/ref&gt; that ''artha'', as well as the concept of Puruṣārthas, is a myth. The various schools and ancient Sanskrit texts  provide no consensus opinion, notes Krishna, rather they present a debate, a diversity of views on what ''artha'' and Puruṣārtha means. Inconsistencies and conflicting verses are even present within the same script, such as the Manusmriti. Some ancient Indian texts suggest artha are instruments that enable satisfaction of desires; some include wealth, some include power, and some such as the [[Bhakti movement|bhakti school]]s include instruments to love God. Some of this, suggests Krishna, reflects differences in human needs. Perhaps, conjectures Krishna, artha is just a subset of [[kama]] and [[karma]].&lt;ref name=dayak/&gt;

[[Vatsyayana]] in Kama Sutra defines ''artha'' as the acquisition of arts, land, cattle, wealth, equipages and friends. He explains, artha is also protection of what is already acquired, and the increase of what is protected.&lt;ref name=ksv&gt;The Hindu Kama Shastra Society (1925), [https://archive.org/stream/kamasutraofvatsy00vatsuoft#page/8/mode/2up The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana], University of Toronto Archives, pp. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gavin Flood]] explains&lt;ref name=gavinf&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, {{ISBN|978-1-896209-30-2}}, pp 11–13&lt;/ref&gt; artha as "worldly success" without violating dharma (moral responsibility), kama (love) and one's journey towards moksha (spiritual liberation). Flood clarifies that ''artha'' in ancient Hindu literature, as well as purushartha, is better understood as a goal of Man (not a man). In other words, it is one of the four purposes of human life. The survival and the thriving of humans requires artha - that is, economic activity, wealth and its creation, worldly success, profit, political success and all that is necessary for human existence.&lt;ref name=gavinf/&gt;

==History==
The word Artha appears in the oldest known scriptures of India. However, the term connotes 'purpose', goal or 'aim' of something, often as purpose of ritual sacrifices. Over time, artha evolves into a broader concept in the [[Upanishad]]ic era. It is first included as part of ''Trivarga'' concept (three categories of human life - dharma, artha and kama),&lt;ref name=ka&gt;See:
* Kautilya Arthashastra at 1.7.3–7; For English translation - Rangarajan (1987), Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|978-0-14-044603-6}};
* Ashok S. Chousalkar (2004), Methodology of Kautilya's Arthashastra, The Indian Journal of Political Science, Vol. 65, No. 1, pp. 55–76&lt;/ref&gt; which over time expanded into the concept ''Caturvarga'' (four categories, including moksha). ''Caturvarga'' is also referred to as Puruṣārtha.&lt;ref name=gavinf13&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, {{ISBN|978-1-896209-30-2}}, pp 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mimamsa]] school of Hinduism explained artha, dharma and kama by contrasting Puruṣārtha and Kratvartha. Puruṣārtha is human purpose of a [[yajna]], while Kratvartha is sacrificial purpose of a [[yajna]]. They recognized and explained all human actions have two effects: first, every act affects itself regardless of actors involved; second, every act has human meanings, hopes and desires and affects each actor in a personal way.&lt;ref name=gavinf13/&gt; Jaimini explained in 3rd century BC, that this human meaning cannot be separated from the human goal. The ''phala'' (fruit, result) of a sacrifice is implicit in the ''artha'' (meaning, purpose) of the sacrifice. Mimamsa school then argued that man is for the purpose of actions demanded by Vedic injunctions (apauruseya), and such subordination of man to rituals allows man to reach heaven.&lt;ref name=gavinf13/&gt; Other schools of Hinduism, such as Yoga and Vedanta schools, disagreed with Mimamsa school. They argued that rituals and sacrifice are means, not ends. Their emphasis shifted from rituals to effort and knowledge, from heaven to moksha, from freedom after life to freedom in this life, from human being as a cog in cosmic wheel to human being as an end in himself. For example, [[Aranyaka#Aitareya Aranyaka|Aitareya Aranyaka]] recites:
{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;
He knows tomorrow, he knows the world and what is not the world.
By the mortal he desires the immortal, being this endowed.
Man is the sea, he is above all the world.
Whatever he reaches he desires to go beyond it.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Thereafter came a flowering of the [[Shastra]]ic literature on Artha and other aims of human beings: of dharma in [[Dharmashastra]]s, of artha in [[Arthashastra]]s, of kama in [[Kamashastra]]s (Kamasutra being one part of the compendium).&lt;ref name=gavinf13/&gt; Different schools of Hinduism offer different perspectives on artha, just like dharma, karma and moksha. Most historical literature of ancient India from about 5th century BC and after, interlaces all four aims of humans. Many Upanishads as well as the two Indian Epics - the Ramayana and the Mahabharata - discuss and use the words dharma, artha, kama and moksha as part of their respective themes. Even subhasitas, gnomic and didatic Indian literature from 1st and 2nd millennium CE, incorporate artha and other three aims of human life.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwik Sternbach (1974), Subhasitas, Gnomic and Didatic Literature, in A History of Indian Literature Volume IV, {{ISBN|3-447-01546-2}}, Otto Harrassowitz, Germany, pp. 1–76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relative precedence between Artha, Kama and Dharma==
Ancient Indian literature emphasizes that [[dharma]] is foremost. If dharma is ignored, artha and kama - profit and pleasure respectively - lead to social chaos.&lt;ref name=gavinf16&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, {{ISBN|978-1-896209-30-2}}, pp 16–21&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gautama's Dharmasutra|Gautama]] Dharmashastra, [[Apastamba]] Dharmasutra and [[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]], as examples, all suggest that dharma comes first and is more important than artha and kama.&lt;ref&gt;See:

[[Vatsyayana]], the author of [[Kamasutra]], recognizes relative value of three goals as follows: artha is more important and should precede kama, while dharma is more important and should precede both kama and artha.&lt;ref name=ksv/&gt; Kautiliya's [[Arthashastra]], however, argues that artha is the foundation for the other two. Without prosperity and security in society or at individual level, both moral life and sensuality become difficult. Poverty breeds vice and hate, while prosperity breeds virtues and love, suggested Kautiliya.&lt;ref name=gavinf16/&gt; Kautilya adds that all three are mutually connected, and one should not cease enjoying life, nor virtuous behavior, nor pursuit of wealth creation. Excessive pursuit of any one aspect of life with complete rejection of other two, harms all three including the one excessively pursued.&lt;ref name=ka/&gt;

Some&lt;ref name=ksv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.V. Kane (1941), History of Dharmashastra, Volume 2, Part 1, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; ancient Indian literature observe that the relative precedence of artha, kama and dharma are naturally different for different people and different age groups. In a baby or child, education and kama takes precedence; in youth kama and artha take precedence; while in old age dharma takes precedence.

The Epics such as the Mahabharata debate the relative precedence of dharma, artha, kama and moksha, through the different characters in Book 12, the [[Shanti Parva|Book of Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Zachner (1962), pp 115–117&lt;/ref&gt; Rishi [[Vidura]] says dharma must take the highest precedence. [[Arjuna]] claims without profit and prosperity (artha), people's ability for dharma and kama fall apart. [[Bhima]] claims pleasure and sex (kama) come first, because without these there is no dharma, artha or moksha. [[Yudhishthira]] asserts dharma should always lead one, including in matters of artha and kama, but then admits balancing dharma, artha and kama is often confusing and difficult.&lt;ref name=gavinf16/&gt; In another book, the Mahabharata suggests that morality, profit and pleasure - dharma, artha and kama - all three must go together for happiness:
{{Quote|1=Morality is well practiced by the good. Morality, however, is always afflicted by two things, the desire of Profit entertained by those that covet it, and the desire for Pleasure cherished by those that are wedded to it. Whoever without afflicting Morality and Profit, or Morality and Pleasure, or Pleasure and Profit, followeth all three - Morality, Profit and Pleasure - always succeeds in obtaining great happiness.|2=The [[Mahabharata]]|3=Book 9.60&lt;ref&gt;Kisari Mohan Ganguli (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri05royp#page/232/mode/2up Book 9:Calya Parva] The Mahabharata, pp 232&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contemporary relevance==
Gavin Flood suggests the concepts embedded in purushartha, which includes artha, reflect a deep understanding and insights into human nature, and of conflicts which are inevitably faced by all human beings. It is an attempt to acknowledge and encourage one to understand diversity yet seek coherence between people, rather than deny one or more aspects of human life or force a particular precept and code on people.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, {{ISBN|978-1-896209-30-2}}, pp 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Halbfass (1994), Menschsein und Lebensziele: Beobachtungen zu den puruṣārthas, In Hermeneutics of Encounter: Essays in Honour of Gerhard Oberhammer on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday (Editors: D'Sa and Mesquita), Vienna, pp 123–135&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Davis suggests that ''artha'', ''kama'' and ''dharma'' are broadly applicable human aims, that extend beyond Hindu studies. They are Indian perspective on the nature of human life, a perspective shared in Jain and Buddhist literature.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Davis Jr. (2004), Being Hindu or Being Human: A Reappraisal of the Puruṣārthas, International Journal of Hindu Studies, 8.1–3, pp 1–27&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Bestiarii (EUR Museum).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Relief of bestiarii and animals in the [[Museum of Roman Civilization]].]] --&gt;
Among [[Ancient Romans]], '''''bestiarii''''' (singular '''''bestiarius''''') were those who went into combat with beasts, or were exposed to them. It is conventional&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0247&amp;q1=bestiarii Entry on Bestiarii] at Chambers, Ephraim, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'', c. 1680-1740&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish two categories of ''bestiarii'': the first were those condemned to death via the beasts (see ''[[damnatio ad bestias]]'') and the second were those who faced them voluntarily, for pay or glory (see ''[[venatio]]'').&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;William Smith, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Bestiarii.html "Bestiarii"] from ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', John Murray: London, 1875. Public domain.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter are sometimes erroneously called ''[[gladiator]]s''; to their contemporaries, however, the term ''gladiator'' referred specifically to one who fought other men. The contemporary term for those who made a career out of participating in arena "hunts" was '''[[List of Roman gladiator types#Venator|venatores]]'''.

== As a form of execution ==
As a means of [[torture|torturous]] [[capital punishment]], death by wild beasts was a punishment for [[enemy of the state|enemies of the state]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/bestiarii.html The Bestiarius and the Ludus Matutinus]&lt;/ref&gt; a category which included those taken prisoner and slaves found guilty of a serious crime. These were sent to their deaths naked and unable to defend themselves against the beasts. Even if they succeeded in killing one, fresh animals were continually let loose on them, until the ''bestiarii'' were all dead. It is reported that it was seldom necessary for two beasts to be required to take down one man. On the contrary, one beast frequently dispatched several men. [[Cicero]] mentions a single lion which alone dispatched 200 ''bestiarii''.&lt;!--all at once, or over time?--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"/&gt;

== Voluntary combat ==
''Bestiarii'', as reported by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]],&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"/&gt; consisted of young men who, to become expert in managing their arms, fought sometimes against beasts, and sometimes against one another; and of bravos who, to show their courage and dexterity, exposed themselves to this dangerous combat. [[Augustus]] encouraged this practice in young men of the first rank; [[Nero]] exposed himself to it; and it was for killing beasts in the [[amphitheatre]] that [[Commodus]] acquired the title of the Roman [[Hercules]].&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"/&gt;

[[Blaise de Vigenère|Vigenère]] adds two more types of ''bestiarii'':&lt;ref&gt;''Cyclopaedia'', apparently referring to some one of Vigenère's French translations of Latin works, such as his translation of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s ''[[Caesar's Commentaries (disambiguation)|Commentaries]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the first were those who made a trade of it, and fought for money. It appears that there were schools in Rome, in which people were trained to fight wild beasts (''scholae bestiarum'', or ''bestiariorum'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]]'s ''[[Apologeticus]]'', [http://www.tertullian.org/latin/apologeticum_becker.htm#C35 chapter 35]; cited in Smith 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; The second type was where several armed ''bestiarii'' were let loose at once against a number of beasts.&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"/&gt;

{{Psychiatry in Russia and the USSR}}
[[File:Serbskij-institute.jpg|thumb|The Serbsky Central Research Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, also briefly called the [[Serbsky Institute]] (the part of its building in [[Moscow]])]]

In the [[Soviet Union]], a systematic [[political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|political abuse of psychiatry]] took place&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BMA|1992|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Bonnie|2002}}; {{harvnb|Finckenauer|1995|p=52}}; {{harvnb|Gershman|1984}}; {{harvnb|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=490}}; {{harvnb|Knapp|2007|p=406}}; {{harvnb|Kutchins|Kirk|1997|p=293}}; {{harvnb|Lisle|2010|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Merskey|1978}}; {{harvnb|Society for International Development|1984|p=19}}; {{harvs|txt|author=US GPO|year1=1972|year2=1975|year3=1976|year4=1984|year5=1988}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Voren|year1=2002|year2=2010a|year3=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was based on the interpretation of political dissent as a psychiatric problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=425}}; {{harvnb|UPA Herald|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was called "psychopathological mechanisms" of dissent.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}}

During the leadership of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]], psychiatry was used as a tool to eliminate political opponents ("dissidents") who openly expressed beliefs that contradicted official dogma.{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=17}} The term "philosophical intoxication" was widely used to diagnose mental disorders in cases where people disagreed with leaders and made them the target of criticism that used the writings by [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Vladimir Lenin]].{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=15}} [[Article 58]]-10 of the Stalin Criminal Code—which as [[anti-Soviet agitation|Article 70]] had been shifted into the RSFSR Criminal Code of 1962—and Article 190-1 of the RSFSR Criminal Code along with the system of diagnosing mental illness, developed by academician [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]], created the very preconditions under which non-standard beliefs could easily be transformed into a criminal case, and it, in its turn, into a psychiatric diagnosis.{{sfn|Kovalyov|2007}} Anti-Soviet political behavior, in particular, being outspoken in opposition to the authorities, demonstrating for reform, writing books were defined in some persons as being simultaneously a criminal act (e.g., violation of Articles 70 or 190-1), a symptom (e.g., "delusion of reformism"), and a diagnosis (e.g., "[[sluggish schizophrenia]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|US Delegation Report|1989|p=26}}; {{harvnb|US Delegation Report (Russian translation)|2009|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the boundaries of the diagnostic category, the symptoms of pessimism, poor social adaptation and conflict with authorities were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia."{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}}

The process of psychiatric incarceration was instigated by attempts to emigrate; distribution or possession of prohibited documents or books; participation in civil rights actions and demonstrations, and involvement in forbidden religious activity.{{sfn|Chodoff|1985}} The religious faith of prisoners, including  well-educated former atheists who adopted a religion, was determined to be a form of mental illness that needed to be cured.{{sfn|Pospielovsky|1988|pp=36, 140, 156, 178–181}} The [[KGB]] routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing publiс trials and to discredit dissidence as the product of ill minds.{{sfn|Murray|1983}} Formerly highly classified government documents published after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] demonstrate that the authorities used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gluzman|year1=2009a|year2=2013b}}; {{harvnb|Voren|2013|p=8}}; {{harvnb|Fedenko|2009}}; see some documents in {{harvnb|Pozharov|1999}}; {{harvnb|Soviet Archives|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Commentary on the Russian Federation Law on Psychiatric Care'', persons who were subjected to repressions in the form of commitment for compulsory treatment to psychiatric medical institutions and were rehabilitated in accordance with the established procedure receive compensation. The [[Russian Federation]] acknowledged that psychiatry was used for political purposes and took responsibility for the victims of "political psychiatry."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dmitrieva|2002}}; {{harvnb|Pshizov|2006|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political abuse of psychiatry in Russia]] continues after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voren|2013|pp=16–18}}; {{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; and threatens human rights activists with a psychiatric diagnosis.{{sfn|NPZ|2005}}

== Background ==
{{Repression in the Soviet Union}}
Political abuse of psychiatry is the misuse of psychiatric diagnosis, detention and treatment for the purposes of obstructing the fundamental human rights of certain groups and individuals in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voren|2010a}}; {{harvnb|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; It entails the [[exculpation]] and committal of citizens to psychiatric facilities based upon political rather than mental health-based criteria.&lt;ref name=Gluzman&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gluzman|year1=2009b|year2=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors, including psychiatrists, also use the terms "Soviet political psychiatry"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abouelleil|Bingham|2014}}; {{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=189}}; {{harvnb|Kadarkay|1982|p=205}}; {{harvnb|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=260}}; {{harvnb|Laqueur|1980|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Munro|2002a|p=179}}; {{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}; {{harvnb|Rejali|2009|p=395}}; {{harvnb|Smythies|1973}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Voren|year1=2010b|loc1=p. 95|year2=2013b}}; {{harvnb|Working Group on the Internment of Dissenters in Mental Hospitals|1983|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "punitive psychiatry" to refer to this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adler|Gluzman|1993}}; {{harvnb|Amnesty International|1991|pp=9, 64}}; {{harvnb|Ball|Farr|1984|p=258}}; {{harvnb|Bebtschuk|Smirnova|Khayretdinov|2012}}; {{harvnb|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|pp=292, 293, 294}}; {{harvnb|Dmitrieva|2001|pp=84, 108}}; {{harvnb|Faraone|1982}}; {{harvnb|Fedor|2011|p=177}}; {{harvnb|Ghodse|2011|p=422}}; {{harvnb|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}}; {{harvnb|Gushansky|2005|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Horvath|2014}}; {{harvnb|Joffe|1984}}; {{harvnb|Kekelidze|2013}}; {{harvnb|Khvorostianov|Elias|2015}}; {{harvnb|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|pp=7, 47, 60, 67, 77, 259, 291}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Koryagin|year1=1988||year2=1989}}; {{harvnb|Kovalyov|2007}}; {{harvnb|Leontev|2010}}; {{harvnb|Magalif|2010}}; {{harvnb|Podrabinek|1980|pp=10, 57, 136}}; {{harvnb|Pukhovsky|2001|pp=243, 252}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Savenko|year1=2005a|year2=2005b}}; {{harvnb|Schmidt|Shchurko|2014}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Szasz|year1=2004|year2=2006}}; {{harvnb|US Delegation Report|1989|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Vitaliev|1991|p=148}}; {{harvnb|Voren|Bloch|1989|pp=92, 95, 98}}; {{harvnb|West|Green|1997|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Zile|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Punitive Medicine'' by [[Alexander Podrabinek]], the term "punitive medicine", which is identified with "punitive psychiatry," is defined as "a tool in the struggle against dissidents who cannot be punished by legal means."{{sfn|Podrabinek|1980|p=63}} Punitive psychiatry is neither a discrete subject nor a psychiatric specialty but, rather, it is an emergency arising within many applied sciences in totalitarian countries where members of a profession may feel themselves compelled to service the diktats of power.{{sfn|Savenko|2005a}} Psychiatric confinement of sane people is uniformly considered a particularly pernicious form of repression&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonnie|2002}}; {{harvnb|US GPO|1984|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Faraone|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soviet punitive psychiatry was one of the key weapons of both illegal and legal repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|Green|1997|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Alexéyeff|1976}}; {{harvnb|US GPO|1984|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] and [[Semyon Gluzman]] wrote in their joint ''A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissenters'', "the Soviet use of psychiatry as a punitive means is based upon the deliberate interpretation of dissent… as a psychiatric problem."{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=425}} This work was published in Russian,{{sfn|Bukovsky|Gluzman|1975c}} English,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|author1=Bukovsky|author2=Gluzman|year1=1975a|year2=1975d|year3=1975e}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,{{sfn|Boukovsky|Glouzmann|1975}} Italian,{{sfn|Bukovskij|Gluzman|Leva|1979}} German,{{sfn|Bukowski|Gluzman|1976}} Danish.{{sfn|Bukovskiĭ|Gluzman|1975b}}

Psychiatry possesses an inherent capacity for abuse that is greater than in other areas of medicine.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}} The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both in the interest of the detainee and in the broader interests of society.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}} In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive.{{sfn|Malterud|Hunskaar|2002|p=94}} In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}} In the period from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to have been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as [[Communist Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=66}} The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community.{{sfn|Lyons|O'Malley|2002}} Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience.{{sfn|Semple|Smyth|Burns|2005|p=6}} As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times coded threats to authority as mental disease during periods of political disturbance and instability.{{sfn|Metzl|2010|p=14}} Nowadays, in many countries, political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.{{sfn|Noll|2007|p=3}}

In the Soviet Union [[dissident]]s were often confined in the so-called ''[[psikhushka]]'', or psychiatric wards.{{sfn|Matvejević|2004|p=32}} ''Psikhushka'' is the [[Russian language|Russian]] ironic diminutive for "mental hospital".{{sfn|Hunt|1998|p=xii}} One of the first ''psikhushkas'' was the Psychiatric Prison Hospital in the city of [[Kazan]]. In 1939 it was transferred to the control of the [[NKVD]], the secret police and the precursor organization to the [[KGB]], under the order of [[Lavrentiy Beria]], who was the head of the NKVD.{{sfn|Birstein|2004}} International [[human rights defenders]] such as [[Walter Reich]] have long recorded the methods by which Soviet psychiatrists in ''Psikhushka'' hospitals diagnosed [[schizophrenia]] in political dissenters.{{sfn|Metzl|2010|p=14}} Western scholars examined no aspect of Soviet psychiatry as thoroughly as its involvement in the social control of political dissenters.{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=292}}

== Individual cases ==

=== Sergei Pisarev ===
Cases of political abuse of psychiatry have been known since the 1940s and 1950s. One of these early cases was that of party official [[Sergei Pisarev]]. Pisarev was arrested after criticizing the work of the Soviet secret police in the context of the so-called [[Doctors' Plot]], an anti-Semitic campaign waged at Stalin's instructions that should have brought about a new terror wave in the Soviet Union and possibly the extermination of the remaining Jewish communes that had outlived the Second World War.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=496}} Pisarev was committed to the Special Psychiatric Hospital in [[Leningrad]] which along with an analogous hospital in Sychevka has started functioning since the [[Second World War]].{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=496}} After his discharge, Pisarev began a campaign against political abuse of psychiatry, concentrating on the [[Serbsky Institute]] which he viewed to be the seat of the trouble.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=496}} As a consequence of his efforts, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] formed a committee which investigated the situation and came to the conclusion that political abuse of psychiatry was actually taking place.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=496}} The report, however, vanished in a desk drawer and never brought about any action.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=496}}

=== Pyotr Grigorenko ===

In 1961, Soviet general [[Pyotr Grigorenko]] started to openly criticize what he considered the excesses of the [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] regime.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=151}} He maintained that the special privileges of the political elite did not comply with the principles laid down by [[Lenin]].{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=151}} Grigorenko formed a dissident group&amp;nbsp;— The Group for the Struggle to Revive [[Leninism]].{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=151}} Soviet psychiatrists from commissions instituted to inquire into his sanity diagnosed him at least three times&amp;nbsp;— in April 1964, August 1969, and November 1969.{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=11}} When arrested, Grigorenko was sent to Moscow's [[Lubyanka prison]], and from there for psychiatric examination to the Serbsky Institute{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=151}} where the first commission, which included Snezhnevsky and Lunts, diagnosed him as suffering from the mental disease in the form of a paranoid delusional development of his personality, accompanied by early signs of cerebral arteriosclerosis.{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=11}} Lunts, reporting later on this diagnosis, mentioned that the symptoms of paranoid development were "an overestimation of his own personality reaching messianic proportions" and "reformist ideas."{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=11}} Grigorenko was irresponsible for his actions and was thereby forcibly committed to a special psychiatric hospital.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=151}} While there, the government deprived him of his pension despite the fact that, by law, a mentally sick military officer was entitled to a pension.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} After six months, Grigorenko was found to be in remission and was released for outpatient follow-up.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} He required that his pension be restored.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} Although he began to draw pension again, it was severely cut.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} He became much more active in his dissidence, stirred other people to protest some of the State's actions and received several warnings from the KGB.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} As Grigorenko had followers in Moscow, he was lured to [[Tashkent]], half a continent away.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} Again he was arrested and examined by psychiatric team.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} None of the manifestations or symptoms cited by the Lunts commission were found by the second commission held in Tashkent under the chairmanship of [[Fyodor Detengof]].{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=12}} The diagnosis and evaluation made by the commission was that "Grigorenko's [criminal] activity had a purposeful character, it was related to concrete events and facts... It did not reveal any signs of illness or delusions."{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=12}} The psychiatrists reported that he was not mentally sick, but responsible for his actions.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} He had firm convictions which were shared by many of his colleagues and were not delusional.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} Having evaluated the records of his preceding hospitalization, they concluded that he had not been sick at that time either.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} The KGB brought Grigorenko back in Moscow and, three months later, arranged a second examination at the Serbsky Institute.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} Once again, these psychiatrists found that he had "a paranoid development of the personality" manifested by reformist ideas.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} The commission, which included Lunts and was chaired by Morozov, recommended that he be recommitted to a special psychiatric hospital for the socially dangerous.{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=12}} Eventually, after almost four years, he was transferred to a usual mental hospital.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}}

In 1971, Dr. [[Semyon Gluzman]] wrote a psychiatric report on Grigorenko.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BMA|1992|p=73}}; {{harvnb|Gluzman|2010b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gluzman came to the conclusion that Grigorenko was mentally sane and had been taken to mental hospitals for political reasons.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=73}} In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gluzman was forced to serve seven years in labor camp and three years in Siberian exile for refusing to diagnose Grigorenko with a mental illness.{{sfn|Sabshin|2009|p=95}}

Andrew, Grigorenko's son, was declared a hereditary madman in 1975 and was expelled from the USSR to the USA where he lives now.{{sfn|Sulkin|2012}} Andrew was repeatedly told that since his father was mentally ill, then he was hereditarily mentally ill as well, and if he would not stop his appearances in defense of human rights and his father, he was told to go to [[psikhushka]].{{sfn|Tolstoy|Gavrilov|2014}}

In 1979 in [[New York (city)|New York]], Grigorenko was examined by the team of psychologists and psychiatrists including [[Alan A. Stone]], the then President of [[American Psychiatric Association]].{{sfn|US GPO|1984|p=74}} The team came to the conclusion that they could find no evidence of mental disease in Grigorenko and his history consistent with mental disease in the past.{{sfn|US GPO|1984|p=74}} The conclusion was drawn up by [[Walter Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Reich|year1=1979|year2=1980a|year3=1980b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone said Grigorenko's case confirms some of the accusations that psychiatry in the Soviet Union is sometimes employed as a tool of political repression.{{sfn|Argus-Press|1979}} In 1981, Pyotr Grigorenko told about his psychiatric examinations and hospitalizations in his memoirs ''V Podpolye Mozhno Vstretit Tolko Krys'' (''In The Underground One Can Meet Only Rats''){{sfn|Grigorenko|1981|pp=681–736}} translated into English under the title ''Memoirs'' in 1982.{{sfn|Grigorenko|1982}} In 1991, a commission, composed of psychiatrists from all over the Soviet Union and led by Modest Kabanov, director of the Bekhterev Psychoneurological Institute in St Petersburg, spent six months reviewing the Grigorenko files, drew up 29 thick volumes of legal proceedings,{{sfn|Rich|1991}} and reversed the official diagnosis on Grigorenko in October 1991.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=73}} In 1992, the official post-mortem forensic psychiatric commission of experts met at Grigorenko's homeland removed the stigma of mental patient from him and confirmed that the debilitating treatment he underwent in high security psychiatric hospitals for many years was groundless.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=23}} The 1992 psychiatric examination of Grigorenko was described by the ''[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]'' in its numbers 1–4 of 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Savenko|year1=2004|year2=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viktor Rafalsky ===
[[Viktor Rafalsky]], a political prisoner, dissident and author of unpublished plays, novels, and short stories, was committed to Soviet psychiatric prisons in [[Lviv]], [[Dnipropetrovsk]], and [[Leningrad]] for 24 years because of belonging to a clandestine Marxist group (from 1954 to 1959), writing anti-Soviet prose (from 1962 to 1965), and possessing anti-Soviet literature (from 1968 to 1983).{{sfn|Struk|1993|p=308}} In the winter of 1987, he was discharged and pronounced sane.{{sfn|Struk|1993|p=308}} In 1988, Viktor Rafalsky published the first version of his memoirs ''Reportazh iz Niotkuda'' (''Reportage from Nowhere''){{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=219}} describing his confinement in Soviet psychiatric hospitals.{{sfn|Rafalsky|1995}} In his memoirs, he writes, "I will say plain: when I got into a prison (it happened quite often), I, whether you believe or not, had a rest. So what was a prison in comparison with the horror of prison psikhushkas?!"{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=228}} Some pages below, he adds, "In a prison, you can read, write, lastly do something to kill time. In prison psikhushkas, you have the right only to look at the ceiling: it is forbidden to keep paper, pencils, and even a book."{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=240}}

=== Joseph Brodsky ===
[[File:Josef Brodsky crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Brodsky]] (1940–1996), a Russian poet, American essayist, and the 1987 [[Nobel laureate]] in Literature]]
At the very end of 1963, the poet [[Joseph Brodsky]] was committed for observation to the Kashchenko psychiatric clinic in Moscow where he stayed for several days.{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=91}} A few weeks later, his second hospitalization took place: on 13 February he was arrested in Leningrad.{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=91}} Brought to trial for "pursuing a parasitic way of life", Brodsky was accused of being a poet and of not doing more "productive" work.{{sfn|Szasz|1991}} There were two hearings of the trial dated 18 February and 13 March 1964.{{sfn|Szasz|1991}} The judge ordered to send him "for an official psychiatric examination during which it will be determined whether Brodsky is suffering from some sort of psychological illness or not and whether this illness will prevent Brodsky from being sent to a distant locality for forced labor. Taking into consideration that from the history of his illness it is apparent that Brodsky has evaded hospitalization, it is hereby ordered that division No. 18 of the militia be in charge of bringing him to the official psychiatric examination."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szasz|1991}}; {{harvnb|The New Leader|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 February, the Dzerzhinsky District Court sent Brodsky for psychiatric examination to "Pryazhka," Psychiatric Hospital No. 2 where he spent about three weeks, from 18 February to 13 March.{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=91}} In the mental hospitals, Brodsky was given "tranquilizing" injections, wakened in the middle of the night, immersed into a cold bath, wrapped in a wet sheet, and put next to the heater so that the sheet would cut into his body when it dried.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=279}}; {{harvnb|Brodsky|Haven|2002|p=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two stints at psychiatric establishments formed the experience underlying ''[[Gorbunov and Gorchakov]]'' written and called by Brodsky "an extremely serious work."{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=90}} In 1972, when the authorities considered Brodsky for exile and sought an expert opinion on his mental health, they consulted Snezhnevsky who, without examining him personally, diagnosed him as schizophrenic and concluded that he was "not valuable person at all and may be let go."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}; {{harvnb|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Valery Tarsis ===
[[File:Valery Tarsis (1906 - 1983) (7650226650).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Valery Tarsis]] (1906–1983), a Russian writer and political prisoner]]
In 1965 in the West, strong public awareness that Soviet psychiatry could be subject to political abuse arose with publication of the book ''Ward 7''{{sfn|Tarsis|1965}} by [[Valery Tarsis]], a writer born in 1906 in [[Kiev]].{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} He based the book upon his own experiences in 1963–1964 when he was detained in the Moscow Kashchenko psychiatric hospital for political reasons.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}}

The fictionalised documentary'' Ward No. 7'' by Tarsis was the first literary work to deal with the Soviet authorities' abuse of psychiatry.{{sfn|Marsh|1986|p=208}} In a parallel with the story ''Ward No. 6'' by [[Anton Chekhov]], Tarsis implies that it is the doctors who are mad, whereas the patients are completely sane, although unsuited to a life of slavery.{{sfn|Marsh|1986|p=208}} Individuals in ward No. 7 are not cured, but persistently maimed; the hospital is a jail and the doctors are gaolers and police spies.{{sfn|Marsh|1986|p=208}} Most doctors know nothing about psychiatry, but make diagnoses arbitrarily and give all patients the same medication&amp;nbsp;— an algogenic injection or the anti-psychotic drug Aminazin{{sfn|Marsh|1986|p=208}} known in the USA under trade name [[Thorazine]].{{sfn|Parr|1981|p=137}} Tarsis denounces Soviet psychiatry as pseudo-science and charlatanism and writes that, firstly, it has pretenses of curing the sickness of men's souls, but denies the existence of the soul; secondly, since there is no satisfactory definition of mental health, there can be no acceptable definition of mental disease in Soviet society.{{sfn|Marsh|1986|p=208}}

In 1966, Tarsis was permitted to emigrate to the West, and was soon deprived of his Soviet citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}; {{harvnb|Voren|2010b|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KGB had plans to compromise the literary career of Tarsis abroad through labelling him as a mentally ill person.{{sfn|Pietikäinen|2015|p=279}} As the 1966 memorandum to the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] reported, "KGB continues arrangements for further compromising Tarsis abroad as a mentally ill person."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Questions of Literature|1996}}; {{harvnb|Soviet Archives|1966|loc=P238/132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among all the victims of Soviet psychiatry, Tarsis was the sole exception in the sense that he did not emphasised the 'injustice' of confining 'sane dissidents' to psychiatric hospitals and did not thereby imply that the psychiatric confinement of 'insane patients' was proper and just.{{sfn|Szasz|1978}}

=== Evgeni Belov ===
Shortly after publishing ''Ward 7'', a second case of political abuse of psychiatry gave rise to attention in [[Great Britain]].{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} [[Evgeni Belov]], a young Moscow interpreter contracted by a group of four British students, made friends with them.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} At first he was positive about Soviet system, but gradually became more critical and began to voice demand for more freedom.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} Calling for a free press and free trade unions, Belov began to write letters to the Party.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} As a consequence, his membership in the Party was suspended and he was summoned to appear before a committee.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} He declined, and instead sought justice higher up by writing protest letters to [[Leonid Brezhnev]] himself.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} When British students returned from a short trip to [[Tokyo]], Belov had vanished.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} To their shock, it emerged that he had been committed to a mental hospital.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} A campaign to get him out yielded no results.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} A British newspaper published a letter in which Belov's father stated that his son was really sick, and the campaign came to a grinding halt.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} However, the public interest had been activated.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}}

=== Alexander Esenin-Volpin ===

Awareness in the West was also raised by the case of [[Alexander Esenin-Volpin]], a son of the famous Russian poet [[Sergei Esenin]] and born in 1924.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} In 1946, he was first committed to the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital for writing a poem considered anti-Soviet.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} During Khrushchev's reign, Esenin-Volpin was later hospitalized three times: in 1957, in 1959–1960 in the same the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital and, finally, in 1962–1963.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=141}} In 1968, Esenin-Volpin was again hospitalized, and for this once his case achieved the attention in the West.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=141}} In February 1968, 99 Soviet mathematicians and scientists signed a protest letter to the Soviet officials demanding his release.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voren|2010b|p=141}}; {{harvnb|Zdravkovska|Duren|1993|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a wave of protests, he was discharged and permitted to immigrate to the USA where he obtained the position of professor of mathematics.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=141}} In 2010, [[Alexander Magalif]], who hospitalized Esenin-Volpin, recollected that he had seen a little mark made by a pencil in the corner of the referral to treatment of Esenin-Volpin: "not to discharge from the hospital without coordination with KGB."{{sfn|Magalif|2010}}

=== Yuli Daniel ===
In 1965, the writer [[Yuli Daniel]] was arrested due to his satirical anti-Stalinist works and outspoken protest at the human rights abuse in the USSR.{{sfn|Kosserev|Crawshaw|1994}} Daniel was kept in a mental hospital of the Gulag where he was refused medical treatment in order to destroy his will.{{sfn|Kosserev|Crawshaw|1994}}

After the [[1968 Red Square demonstration]] against the Soviet invasion into [[Czechoslovakia]], August 1968 saw the arrest of [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] well known in the West due to her book ''Red Square at Noon'' describing the demonstration.{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} A few days later, the Serbsky Institute found her non-accountable and made diagnosis of "deep psychopathy—the presence of mild, chronic schizophrenic process cannot be excluded."{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} She was allowed to return to the care of her mother.{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} In November 1969, a psychiatric commission again examined her, diagnosed "psychopathic personality with symptoms of hysteria and a tendency to decompensation", but considered that psychiatric hospitalization was not required.{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} A month later, she was again arrested and sent to the Serbsky Institute for psychiatric examination in April 1970.{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} The investigating commission chaired by Morozov found her non-responsible and suffering from "chronic, mental illness in the form of schizophrenia."{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} The commission found in her the presence of changes in the thinking processes and in the critical and emotional faculties characteristic of schizophrenia.{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} It was concluded that Gorbanevskaya took part in the Red Square demonstration in a state of the mental disease.{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} In Paris, French psychiatrists at their request examined Gorbanevskaya and found her to be mentally normal.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p = 201}} They concluded that in 1969–1972 she had been committed to a psychiatric hospital for political, not medical reasons.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p = 201}}

On 29 May 1970, [[Zhores Medvedev]], an internationally respected and prominent scientist, was forcibly taken from his apartment in [[Obninsk]] and committed to a mental hospital where he was held, without legitimate medical justification, until 17 June 1970.{{sfn|Leichter|1979|p = 232}} The leadership was instantly faced with the action of strong collective protest initiated by top Soviet scientists including [[Igor Tamm]] and [[Pyotr Kapitsa]].{{sfn|Jacobson|1972|p = 22}} Medvedev's release was achieved only after intense pressure from intellectuals and scientists both within and outside of the USSR.{{sfn|Leichter|1979|p = 232}} He was largely hospitalized because of the publication abroad of his book of [[Trofim Lysenko]].{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1998|p = 95}} In widely circulated books, Zhores Medvedev had criticized the "geneticist" Lysenko and had also expressed his straightforward disagreement with restrictions on communication with scientists abroad.{{sfn|Wing|Mechanic|2009|p = 178}} He was removed from his position as head of a laboratory at the Institute of Medical Radiology and this removal was illegal, he said.{{sfn|Wing|Mechanic|2009|p = 178}} The diagnosis in the case-notes was "incipient schizophrenia," the diagnosis made by the psychiatric commission was "psychopathic personality with paranoid tendencies."{{sfn|Wing|Mechanic|2009|p = 178}} What happened to Medvedev was not a separate incident; rather, it was part, in Medvedev's words, of "the dangerous tendency of using psychiatry for political purposes, the exploitation of medicine in an alien role as a means of intimidation and punishment&amp;nbsp;— a new and illegal way of isolating people for their views and convictions."{{sfn|Leichter|1979|p = 232}} This experience was reflected in Zhores Medvedev's and [[Roy Medvedev]]'s book ''A Question of Madness: Repression by Psychiatry in the Soviet Union'' published by Macmillan in London in 1971.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1971}}

=== Andrei Sakharov ===
[[File:RIAN archive 25981 Academician Sakharov.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Andrei Sakharov]] (1921–1989), an [[academician]] of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]], [[nuclear physicist]] and [[human rights activist]]]]
In 1971, renowned Soviet physicist [[Andrei Sakharov]] supported a protest of two political prisoners, V. Fainberg and V. Borisov, who announced a [[hunger strike]] against "compulsory therapeutic treatment with medications injurious to mental activity" in a Leningrad psychiatric institution.{{sfn|Sakharov's Telegram|1971}} In 1984, after publishing an article by Andrei Sakharov in the [[United States]] urging a buildup of nuclear weapons in the West, Soviet officials declared him "a talented, but sick man."{{sfn|Christenson|1999|p = 29}} When sent into internal exile to [[Gorky (city)|Gorky]] "for his own peace of mind," according to officials, "Soviet medics are taking all necessary measures to restore his health."{{sfn|Christenson|1999|p = 29}} One day in a selected auditorium, when discussing the situation in the country, Snezhnevsky, in the words of some of his clinical staff, diagnosed Sakharov with sluggish schizophrenia in absentia.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013a}} The director of KGB political police department (Fifth Directorate) [[Philipp Bobkov]] concluded, "Sakharov is objectively a mentally ill person. The complication with regards to operational consequences lies in the fact that for political reasons he cannot be committed to a psychiatric hospital."{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p = 95}} Soviet authorities compulsorily committed Sakharov to a closed ward of the Semashko Hospital in Gorky, where he was force-fed and given drugs to change the state of his mind.{{sfn|Glazov|2015}}

=== Viktor Nekipelov ===
[[Viktor Nekipelov]], a well-known dissident poet, was arrested in 1973, sent to the Section 4 of the Serbsky Institute of Forensic Psychiatry for psychiatric evaluation, which lasted from 15 January to 12 March 1974, was judged sane (which he was), tried, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment.{{sfn|Lader|1980}} In 1976, he published in [[samizdat]] his book ''Institute of Fools: Notes on the Serbsky Institute''{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p = 147}} based on his personal experience at Psychiatric Hospital of the Serbsky Institute{{sfn|Jena|2008|p = 86}} and translated into English in 1980.&lt;ref name="Nekipelov 1980"&gt;{{harvnb|Nekipelov|1980}}; {{harvnb|Keefer|Pavlychko|1998|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this account, he wrote compassionately, engagingly, and observantly of the doctors and other patients; most of the latters were ordinary criminals feigning insanity in order to be sent to a mental hospital, because hospital was a "cushy number" as against prison camps.{{sfn|Lader|1980}} According to the President of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] [[Yuri Savenko]], Nekipelov's book is a highly dramatic humane document, a fair story about the nest of Soviet punitive psychiatry, a mirror that psychiatrists always need to look into.{{sfn|Savenko|2005b}} However, according to Malcolm Lader, this book as an indictment of the Serbsky Institute hardly rises above tittle-tattle and gossip, and Nekipelov destroys his own credibility by presenting no real evidence but invariably putting the most sinister connotation on events.{{sfn|Lader|1980}} After publishing his book, he was sentenced to the maximum punishment for "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda" of seven years in a labor camp and then five years in internal exile.{{sfn|Lader|1980}}

== Political abuse of groups ==

=== AGDHR members ===
In 1968, the human rights movement in the USSR focused directly on Soviet political psychiatry, organizing public protests and writing international bodies.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=395}} In 1969, a group of about 14 activists including [[Sergei Kovalyov]], a future Russian human rights ombudsman, constituted the [[Action Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR]].{{sfn|Hegarty|Leonard|1999|p=343}} The group composed the first ''[[samizdat]]'' (self-published) human rights bulletin, ''[[A Chronicle of Current Events]]''.{{sfn|Hegarty|Leonard|1999|p=343}} Among the members of the Action Group were individuals who subsequently fell victim to psychiatric abuse themselves: the poet [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] who in 1968 demonstrated on [[Red Square]] against bringing Soviet tanks into [[Czechoslovakia]]; [[Vladimir Borisov]] who later was one of the founders of the independent labor movement in the Soviet Union; [[Vladimir Maltsev (translator)|Vladimir Maltsev]], a translator; and [[Leonid Plyushch]], a Ukrainian [[cyberneticist]] who was committed to the Special Psychiatric Hospital of [[Dnepropetrovsk]] and was awfully tortured with [[neuroleptics]].{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=141}} Later three senior Fellows of the Royal College of Psychiatrists examined Leonid Plyushch and "saw no indication of schizophrenia or other mental illness."{{sfn|Wing|Mechanic|2009|p=185}}

=== AFTU members ===
In November 1977, a group of unemployed and workers led by [[Vladimir Klebanov]], a former coalminer from the [[Donbas]] region of the [[Ukraine]], announced the formation in the Soviet Union of the [[Association of Free Trade Unions of Workers]] (AFTU) whose purposes were to meet obligations achieved by collective bargaining; to induce workers and other employees to join free trade union associations; to implement those decisions of the Association which concern the seeking of justice and the defense of rights; to educate Association members in the spirit of irreconcilability toward wastefulness, inefficiency, deception, bureaucracy, deficiencies, and a negligent attitude toward national wealth.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=55}} These purposes show that AFTU was in all respects an organization whose right to exist is guaranteed by the international obligations of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} On 19 December 1977, Klebanov along with two other workers in [[Donetsk]] was arrested by the Soviet militia and released nine days later, after international protests against his incarceration.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} Worker [[Gavriil Yankov]] was incarcerated in Moscow mental hospital for two weeks.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} On 1 February 1978, AFTU publicly announced the institution of its organizational Charter.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} Several days later, Klebanov was again detained by Soviet police and sent from Moscow to psychiatric prison hospital in Donetsk.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} Group member Nikolaev and workers Pelekh and Dvoretsky were also placed under psychiatric detention.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}}

=== SMOT members ===
By October 1978 it was apparent that arrests and repressions had resulted in the dissolution of AFTU.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} But the cause of trade union rights was to be invigorated by a new group, the [[Free Interprofessional Association of Workers]] known by its Russian acronym, SMOT, whose first press conference was held in Moscow on 28 October 1978.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} The objectives of SMOT were to defend its members in cases of violation of their rights in different spheres of their daily activities: political, domestic, religious, spiritual, cultural, social, and economic; to look into the legal basis of the workers' complaints; to ensure that these complains were brought to the notice of relevant organizations; to facilitate a quick solution to complaints of workers; and in cases of negative results, to publicize them widely before international and Soviet public.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=57}} The leadership of SMOT was headed by a native of [[Leningrad]] electrician [[Vladimir Borisov]] incarcerated in Soviet mental hospitals because of his human rights activism for a total of nine years in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} In November and December 1978, Soviet police searched the homes of SMOT activists, and SMOT members Vladimir Borisov, [[Valeriya Novodvorskaya]], [[Albina Yakoreva]], and [[Lev Volokhonsky]] were arrested and detained by Soviet authorities.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=58}} Both Borisov and Novodvorskaya were held in mental hospitals.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=58}}

[[File:Commutativity of binary operations (without question mark).svg|thumb|An operation &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is commutative [[If and only if|iff]] &lt;math&gt;x\circ y = y \circ x&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. This image illustrates this property with the concept of an operation as a "calculation machine". It doesn't matter for the output &lt;math&gt;x\circ y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y \circ x&lt;/math&gt; respectively which order the arguments &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; have – the final outcome is the same.]]
In [[mathematics]], a [[binary operation]] is '''commutative''' if changing the order of the [[operand]]s does not change the result. It is a fundamental property of many [[binary operations]], and many [[mathematical proof]]s depend on it. Most familiar as the name of the property that says {{nowrap|1="3 + 4 = 4 + 3"}} or {{nowrap|1="2 × 5 = 5 × 2"}}, the property can also be used in more advanced settings. The name is needed because there are operations, such as  [[division (mathematics)|division]] and [[subtraction]], that do not have it (for example, {{nowrap|"3 − 5 ≠ 5 − 3"}}); such operations are ''not'' commutative, and so are referred to as ''noncommutative operations''. The idea that simple operations such as the [[multiplication (mathematics)|multiplication]] and [[addition]] of numbers are commutative, was for many years implicitly assumed. Thus, this property was not named until the 19th century, when mathematics started to become formalized.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A corresponding property exists for [[binary relation]]s; a binary relation is said to be [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] if the relation applies regardless of the order of its operands; for example, [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] is symmetric as two equal mathematical objects are equal regardless of their order.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|id=SymmetricRelation|title=Symmetric Relation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common uses==
The ''commutative property'' (or ''commutative law'') is a property generally associated with binary operations and [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].  If the commutative property holds for a pair of elements under a certain binary operation then the two elements are said to ''commute'' under that operation.

==Mathematical definitions==
{{Further|Symmetric function}}
The term "commutative" is used in several related senses.&lt;ref name="Krowne, p.1"&gt;Krowne, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, ''Commute'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ordered list|1=
A binary operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is called ''commutative'' if:
:&lt;math&gt;x * y = y * x\qquad\mbox{for all }x,y\in S&lt;/math&gt;

An operation that does not satisfy the above property is called ''non-commutative''.
|2=
One says that ''x commutes'' with ''y'' under &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; if:
:&lt;math&gt; x * y = y * x &lt;/math&gt;
|3=
A [[binary function]] &lt;math&gt;f \colon A \times A \to B&lt;/math&gt; is called ''commutative'' if:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = f(y, x)\qquad\mbox{for all }x,y\in A&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Examples ==

===Commutative operations in everyday life===
[[File:Commutative Addition.svg|thumb|The cumulation of apples, which can be seen as an addition of natural numbers, is commutative.]]
*Putting on socks resembles a commutative operation since which sock is put on first is unimportant. Either way, the result (having both socks on), is the same. In contrast, putting on underwear and trousers is not commutative.
*The commutativity of addition is observed when paying for an item with cash.  Regardless of the order the bills are handed over in, they always give the same total.

===Commutative operations in mathematics===
[[File:Vector Addition.svg|thumb|The addition of vectors is commutative, because &lt;math&gt;\vec a+\vec b=\vec b+ \vec a&lt;/math&gt;.]]
Two well-known examples of commutative binary operations:&lt;ref name="Krowne, p.1"/&gt;
* The [[addition]] of [[real number]]s is commutative, since
::&lt;math&gt;y + z = z + y \qquad\mbox{for all }y,z\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:For example 4 + 5 = 5 + 4, since both [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]]s equal 9.
* The [[multiplication]] of [[real number]]s is commutative, since
::&lt;math&gt;y z = z y \qquad\mbox{for all }y,z\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:For example, 3 × 5 = 5 × 3, since both expressions equal 15.
* Some binary [[truth function]]s are also commutative, since the [[truth table]]s for the functions are the same when one changes the order of the operands. 
:For example, the [[logical biconditional]] function p ↔ q is equivalent to q ↔ p. This function is also written as p [[If and only if|IFF]] q, or as p ≡ q, or as E''pq''. 
:The last form is an example of the most concise notation in the article on truth functions, which lists the sixteen possible binary truth functions of which eight are commutative: V''pq'' = V''qp''; A''pq'' (OR) = A''qp''; D''pq'' (NAND) = D''qp''; E''pq'' (IFF) = E''qp''; J''pq'' = J''qp''; K''pq'' (AND) = K''qp''; X''pq'' (NOR) = X''qp''; O''pq'' = O''qp''.
* Further examples of commutative binary operations include addition and multiplication of [[complex number]]s, addition and [[scalar product|scalar multiplication]] of [[vector space|vectors]], and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].

===Noncommutative operations in daily life===

*[[Concatenation]], the act of joining character strings together, is a noncommutative operation. For example,
:{{nowrap|1=EA + T = EAT &amp;ne; TEA = T + EA}}
*Washing and drying clothes resembles a noncommutative operation; washing and then drying produces a markedly different result to drying and then washing.
*Rotating a book 90° around a vertical axis then 90° around a horizontal axis produces a different orientation than when the rotations are performed in the opposite order.
*The twists of the [[Rubik's Cube]] are noncommutative. This can be studied using [[group theory]].
*Thought processes are noncommutative: A person asked a question (A) and then a question (B) may give different answers to each question than a person asked first (B) and then (A), because asking a question may change the person's state of mind.
*The act of dressing is either commutative or non-commutative, depending on the items. Putting on underwear and normal clothing is noncommutative. Putting on left and right socks is commutative.

===Noncommutative operations in mathematics===
Some noncommutative binary operations:&lt;ref&gt;Yark, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtraction and division====

[[Subtraction]] is noncommutative, since &lt;math&gt;0 - 1 \neq 1 - 0&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Division (mathematics)|Division]] is noncommutative, since &lt;math&gt;1 \div 2 \neq 2 \div 1&lt;/math&gt;.

====Truth functions====

Some [[truth function]]s are noncommutative, since the [[truth table]]s for the functions are different when one changes the order of the operands. For example, the truth tables for ''f'' (A, B) {{=}} A Λ ¬B (A AND NOT B) and ''f'' (B, A) {{=}} B Λ ¬A are
:{{aligned table
 | class=wikitable
 | style=text-align:center; width:20%;
 | cols=4
 | col3style=width:30%;
 | col4style=width:30%;
 | row1header=yes
 | A | B | ''f''&amp;nbsp;(A, B) | ''f''&amp;nbsp;(B, A)
 | F | F | F | F
 | F | T | F | T
 | T | F | T | F
 | T | T | F | F
 }}

For the eight noncommutative functions, B''qp'' = C''pq''; M''qp'' = L''pq''; C''qp'' = B''pq''; L''qp'' = M''pq''; F''qp'' = G''pq''; I''qp'' = H''pq''; G''qp'' = F''pq''; H''qp'' = I''pq''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jozef Maria Bochenski]] (1959), ''Precis of [[Mathematical Logic]]'', rev., Albert Menne, ed. and trans., Otto Bird, New York:  Gordon and Breach, Part II, Sec. 3.32, "16 dyadic truth functors", ([[truth tables]]), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Matrix multiplication====

[[Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix]] multiplication is almost always noncommutative, for example:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 2 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} \cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} \neq
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} \cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Vector product====

The vector product (or [[cross product]]) of two vectors in three dimensions is [[anticommutativity|anti-commutative]]; i.e., ''b'' × ''a'' =  −(''a'' × ''b'').

==History and etymology==
[[File:Commutative Word Origin.PNG|right|thumb|250px|The first known use of the term was in a French Journal published in 1814]]

Records of the implicit use of the commutative property go back to ancient times.  The [[Egypt]]ians used the commutative property of [[multiplication]] to simplify computing [[Product (mathematics)|products]].&lt;ref&gt;Lumpkin, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay and Shute, p.?&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euclid]] is known to have assumed the commutative property of multiplication in his book [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']].&lt;ref&gt;O'Conner and Robertson, ''Real Numbers''&lt;/ref&gt;  Formal uses of the commutative property arose in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when mathematicians began to work on a theory of functions.  Today the commutative property is a well-known and basic property used in most branches of mathematics.

The first recorded use of the term ''commutative'' was in a memoir by [[François-Joseph Servois|François Servois]] in 1814,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cabillón and Miller, ''Commutative and Distributive''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Conner and Robertson, ''Servois''&lt;/ref&gt; which used the word ''commutatives'' when describing functions that have what is now called the commutative property.  The word is a combination of the French word ''commuter'' meaning "to substitute or switch" and the suffix ''-ative'' meaning "tending to" so the word literally means "tending to substitute or switch."  The term then appeared in English in 1838&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematics in Victorian Britain|editor1-first=Raymond|editor1-last=Flood|editor2-first=Adrian|editor2-last=Rice|editor3-first=Robin|editor3-last=Wilson|editor3-link=Robin Wilson (mathematician)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YruifIx88AQC&amp;pg=PA4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Duncan Farquharson Gregory]]'s article entitled "On the real nature of symbolical algebra" published in 1840 in the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=D. F. Gregory|title=On the real nature of symbolical algebra|periodical=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|volume=14|pages=208–216|year=1840|url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro14royal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Propositional logic ==
{{Transformation rules}}

=== Rule of replacement ===
In truth-functional propositional logic, ''commutation'',&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Copi |first=Irving M. |last2=Cohen |first2=Carl |title=Introduction to Logic |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''commutativity''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 4th edition |last=Hurley |first=Patrick  |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; refer to two [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of replacement|rules of replacement]]. The rules allow one to transpose [[propositional variable]]s within [[well-formed formula|logical expressions]] in [[formal proof|logical proofs]]. The rules are:

:&lt;math&gt;(P \lor Q) \Leftrightarrow (Q \lor P)&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;(P \land Q) \Leftrightarrow (Q \land P)&lt;/math&gt;

where "&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;" is a [[metalogic]]al [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]] representing "can be replaced in a [[Formal proof|proof]] with."

=== Truth functional connectives ===

''Commutativity'' is a property of some [[logical connective]]s of truth functional [[propositional logic]]. The following [[logical equivalence]]s demonstrate that commutativity is a property of particular connectives. The following are truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]].

;Commutativity of conjunction:&lt;math&gt;(P \land Q) \leftrightarrow (Q \land P)&lt;/math&gt;
;Commutativity of disjunction:&lt;math&gt;(P \lor Q) \leftrightarrow (Q \lor P)&lt;/math&gt;
;Commutativity of implication (also called the law of permutation):&lt;math&gt;(P \to (Q \to R)) \leftrightarrow (Q \to (P \to R))&lt;/math&gt;
;Commutativity of equivalence (also called the complete commutative law of equivalence):&lt;math&gt;(P \leftrightarrow Q) \leftrightarrow (Q \leftrightarrow P)&lt;/math&gt;

== Set theory ==
In [[group theory|group]] and [[set theory]], many algebraic structures are called commutative when certain operands satisfy the commutative property.  In higher branches of mathematics, such as [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[linear algebra]] the commutativity of well-known operations (such as [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] on real and complex numbers) is often used (or implicitly assumed) in proofs.&lt;ref&gt;Axler, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallian, p.34"&gt;Gallian, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 26,87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical structures and commutativity==
* A [[commutative semigroup]] is a set endowed with a total, [[associativity|associative]] and commutative operation.
* If the operation additionally has an [[identity element]], we have a [[commutative monoid]]
* An [[abelian group]], or ''commutative group'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] whose group operation is commutative.&lt;ref name="Gallian, p.34"/&gt;
* A [[commutative ring]] is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] whose [[multiplication]] is commutative. (Addition in a ring is always commutative.)&lt;ref&gt;Gallian p.236&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a [[field (mathematics)|field]] both addition and multiplication are commutative.&lt;ref&gt;Gallian p.250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related properties==

===Associativity===
{{Main|Associative property}}

The associative property is closely related to the commutative property.  The associative property of an expression containing two or more occurrences of the same operator states that the order operations are performed in does not affect the final result, as long as the order of terms doesn't change. In contrast, the commutative property states that the order of the terms does not affect the final result.

Most commutative operations encountered in practice are also associative. However, commutativity does not imply associativity. A counterexample is the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = \frac{x + y}{2},&lt;/math&gt;

which is clearly commutative (interchanging ''x'' and ''y'' does not affect the result), but it is not associative (since, for example, &lt;math&gt;f(-4, f(0, +4)) = -1&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;f(f(-4, 0), +4) = +1&lt;/math&gt;).
More such examples may be found in [[commutative non-associative magmas]].

===Distributive===
{{Main|Distributive property}}

===Symmetry===
[[File:Symmetry Of Addition.svg|right|thumb|200px|Graph showing the symmetry of the addition function]]
{{Main|Symmetry in mathematics}}

Some forms of symmetry can be directly linked to commutativity.  When a commutative operator is written as a binary function then the resulting function is symmetric across the line ''y = x''.  As an example, if we let a function ''f'' represent addition (a commutative operation) so that ''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''x'' + ''y'' then ''f'' is a symmetric function, which can be seen in the adjacent image.

For relations, a [[symmetric relation]] is analogous to a commutative operation, in that if a relation ''R'' is symmetric, then &lt;math&gt;a R b \Leftrightarrow b R a&lt;/math&gt;.

==Non-commuting operators in quantum mechanics==
{{Main|Canonical commutation relation}}

In [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]] as formulated by [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], physical variables are represented by [[linear operators]] such as ''x'' (meaning multiply by ''x''), and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. These two operators do not commute as may be seen by considering the effect of their [[Function composition|compositions]] &lt;math&gt;x \frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} x&lt;/math&gt; (also called products of operators) on a one-dimensional [[wave function]] &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt; x\cdot {\mathrm{d}\over \mathrm{d}x}\psi = x\cdot \psi' \ \neq \ \psi + x\cdot \psi' = {\mathrm{d}\over \mathrm{d}x}\left( x\cdot \psi \right) &lt;/math&gt;

According to the [[uncertainty principle]] of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], if the two operators representing a pair of variables do not commute, then that pair of variables are mutually [[complementarity (physics)|complementary]], which means they cannot be simultaneously measured or known precisely. For example, the position and the linear [[momentum]] in the ''x''-direction of a particle are represented by the operators &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively (where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]]). This is the same example except for the constant &lt;math&gt;-i \hbar&lt;/math&gt;, so again the operators do not commute and the physical meaning is that the position and linear momentum in a given direction are complementary.

'''Composite video''' is an [[Video#Analog video|analog video]] transmission that carries [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] video typically at [[480i]] or [[576i]] [[Display resolution|resolution]] as a single channel. Video information is [[Video coding format|encoded]] on one [[Communication channel|channel]], unlike the higher-quality [[S-video]] (two channels) and the even higher-quality [[component video]] (three or more channels). In all of these video formats, audio is carried on a separate connection. 

Composite video is also known by the initials '''CVBS''' for composite video baseband signal or color, video, blanking and sync,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/734 |title=Video Basics |publisher=[[Maxim Integrated]] |access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lifewire.com/composite-video-the-basics-1846869 |title=Composite Video - The Basics |author=Robert Silva |date=November 8, 2017 |publisher=[[Lifewire]] |access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or is simply referred to as ''SD video'' for the [[standard-definition television]] signal it conveys.

There are three dominant variants of composite video:  [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], and [[SECAM]].

== Signal components ==

[[File:Composite Video.svg|300px|thumb|right]]

A composite video signal combines, on one wire, the video information required to recreate a color picture, as well as line and [[frame synchronization]] pulses. The color video signal is a linear combination of the ''[[luminance]]'' of the picture and a [[modulation|modulated]] subcarrier which carries the ''[[chrominance]]'' or color information, a combination of [[hue]] and [[Colorfulness|saturation]]. Details of the combining process vary between the [[NTSC]], [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] systems.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

The [[Spectral density#Explanation|frequency spectrum]] of the modulated color signal overlaps that of the baseband signal, and separation relies on the fact that frequency components of the baseband signal tend to be near [[harmonics]] of the horizontal scanning rate, while the color carrier is selected to be an odd multiple of half the horizontal scanning rate; this produces a modulated color signal that consists mainly of harmonic frequencies that fall between the harmonics in the baseband [[Luma (video)|luma]] signal, rather than both being in separate continuous frequency bands alongside each other in the frequency domain. In other words, the combination of luma and [[Chrominance|chroma]] is indeed a frequency-division technique, but it is much more complex than typical [[frequency-division multiplexing]] systems like the one used to multiplex analog radio stations on both the AM and FM bands.

A gated and filtered signal derived from the color [[subcarrier]], called the burst or [[colorburst]], is added to the [[horizontal blanking interval]] of each line, excluding the [[Analog television#Vertical synchronization|vertical sync]] interval, as a synchronizing signal and amplitude reference for the [[chrominance]] signals. The burst signal is inverted in phase (180° out of phase) from the reference [[subcarrier]].&lt;ref name="SMPTE 170M-2004"&gt;{{cite book|title=SMPTE STANDARD for Television - Composite Analog Video Signal - NTSC for Studio Applications|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signal modulation ==
Composite video can easily be directed to any broadcast channel simply by modulating the proper RF [[carrier wave]] with it. Most home [[analog video]] equipment record a signal in (roughly) composite format: [[LaserDisc]]s store a true composite signal, while consumer videotape formats (including [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]]) and lesser commercial and industrial tape formats (including [[U-Matic]]) use modified composite signals (generally known as ''color-under'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 4323915|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=4323915.PN.&amp;OS=PN/4323915&amp;RS=PN/4323915|publisher=US Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=12 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220125824/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=4323915.PN.&amp;OS=PN%2F4323915&amp;RS=PN%2F4323915|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On playback, these devices often give the user the option to output the baseband signal or to modulate it onto a [[very high frequency|VHF]] or [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] frequency compatible with a [[Tuner (radio)#Television|TV tuner]] (i.e., appearing on a selected TV channel). The professional [[television production]] [[video compression|uncompressed]] [[digital video]] [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|videocassette]] format known as [[D-2 (video)|D-2]] directly [[digital recording|records]] and reproduces standard [[NTSC]] composite video signals, using PCM encoding of the [[analog signal]] on the [[magnetic tape]].

== Standard connectors ==
In home applications, the composite video signal is typically connected using an [[RCA connector]] (phono plug), normally yellow. It is often accompanied with red and white (or black) connectors for right and left audio channels respectively. [[BNC connector]]s and higher quality [[coaxial cable]] are often used in professional [[television studio]]s and [[post-production]] applications. BNC connectors were also used for composite video connections on early home [[VCR]]s, often accompanied by either [[RCA connector|phono connectors]] or a 5-pin [[DIN connector]] for audio. The BNC connector, in turn post dated the [[UHF connector|PL-259]] connector which featured on first generation VCRs.

In Europe, [[SCART]] connections are often used instead of RCA jacks (and to a lesser extent, [[S-Video]]), so where available, [[component video|RGB]] is used instead of composite video with computers, video game consoles, and [[DVD]] players.

Video cables are 75 ohm impedance, low in capacitance. Typical values run from 52&amp;nbsp;pF/m for an [[HDPE]]-foamed dielectric precision video cable to 69&amp;nbsp;pF/m for a solid PE dielectric cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluejeanscable.com/store/subwoofer/LC1-design-notes.htm |title=LC-1 Audio Cable Design Notes |publisher=Blue Jeans Cable |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128085452/http://www.bluejeanscable.com/store/subwoofer/LC1-design-notes.htm |archivedate=2011-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modulators ==
Some devices that connect to a TV, such as VCRs, older [[video game console]]s and [[home computer]]s of the 1980s, output a composite signal. This may then be converted to RF with an external box known as an [[RF modulator]] that generates the proper carrier (often for channel 3 or 4 in [[North America]], channel 36 in [[Europe]]). Sometimes this modulator was built into the product (such as video game consoles, VCRs, or the [[Atari]], [[Commodore 64]], or [[TRS-80 Color Computer|TRS-80 CoCo]] home-computers) and sometimes it was an external unit powered by the computer (in the case of the [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI-99/4A]] or some [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] modulators) or with an independent power supply. In the United States, using an external RF modulator frees the manufacturer from obtaining FCC approval for each variation of a device. Through the early 1980s, electronics that output a television channel signal were required to meet the same shielding requirements as broadcast television equipment, thus forcing manufacturers such as Apple to omit an RF modulator, and [[Texas Instruments]] to have their RF modulator as an external unit, which they had certified by the FCC without mentioning they were planning to sell it with a computer. In Europe, while most countries used the same broadcast standard, there were different modulation standards (PAL-G versus PAL-I, for example), and using an external modulator allowed manufacturers to make a single product and easily sell it to different countries by changing the modulator. Video game consoles on the other hand were less of an issue with FCC approval because the circuitry was inexpensive enough to allow for channel 3/4 outputs.

Modern day devices with analog outputs have typically omitted channel 3 and 4 outputs in favor of composite and S-video outputs (or have switched to using HDMI or other digital formats) as composite and S-video have become more common as inputs for TVs. In addition, many TV sets sold these days no longer have analog television tuners and cannot accept channel 3/4. But because composite video has a well-established market for both devices that convert it to [[channel 3/4 output]]s, as well as devices that convert things like [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] to composite, it has offered opportunities to [[repurposing|repurpose]] older [[composite monitor]]s for newer devices.

== Demodulation loss ==
The process of modulating RF with the original video signal, and then demodulating the original signal again in the TV, introduces several losses. This conversion also typically adds noise or interference to the signal as well. For these reasons, it is typically best to use composite connections instead of RF connections if possible. Almost all modern video equipment has at least composite connectors, so this typically is not a problem; however, older video equipment and some very low-end modern televisions have only RF input (essentially the antenna jack); while RF modulators are no longer common, they are still available to translate baseband signals for older equipment.

However, just as the modulation and demodulation of RF loses quality, the mixing of the various signals into the original composite signal does the same, causing a checkerboard video artifact known as [[dot crawl]]. Dot crawl is a defect that results from crosstalk due to the intermodulation of the chrominance and luminance components of the signal. This is usually seen when chrominance is transmitted with a high bandwidth, and its spectrum reaches into the band of the luminance frequencies. This has led to a proliferation of systems such as [[S-Video]] and [[component video]] to maintain the signals separately. [[Comb filter]]s are also commonly used to separate signals, and eliminate artifacts, from composite sources.

[[File:Elwro_800_Junior_jednostka_centralna_tyl.jpg|thumb|right|Rear of [[Poland|Polish]] computer Elwro 800 Junior. DIN output called "MONITOR" is just a Composite Video (no color info, only black and white), Sound (mono) and Ground output in that form. Despite computer being designed (and mainly made of Eastern components) on East side of the [[Iron curtain]] it can be connected to modern equipment like VGA-Composite video adapters or monitors with Composite Video input, for example using a popular and simple chinch-DIN cable.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldcomputer.info/8bit/elwro800/index.htm|title=Elwro 800 Junior - MCbx|author=|date=|website=oldcomputer.info|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318162308/http://oldcomputer.info/8bit/elwro800/index.htm|archivedate=18 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
== Aspect ratio in composite signal ==
When used for connecting a video source to a video display that supports both 4:3 and 16:9 display formats, the PAL and NTSC television standards provide for signaling pulses that will automatically switch the display from one format to the other. This is called [[Widescreen signaling|widescreen signalling]] (WSS).

== Extensions to the composite video standard ==
Since TV screens hide the [[vertical blanking interval]] of a composite video signal and even [[overscan|crop the edges of the picture]], extensions have been implemented by taking advantage of these unseen parts of the signal. Examples of these extensions include [[teletext]], [[closed captioning]], digital information regarding the show title, transmitting a set of reference colors that allows TV sets to automatically correct the hue maladjustments common with the NTSC color encoding system, etc.

Other extensions to the standard include [[S-video]]; S-video is an extension to the standard because it uses parallel signal paths for [[luminance]] and for [[chrominance]] (color), of which both of them can be connected to a composite video input but with either monochrome ([[Luma (video)|luma]]), or uniform-luma color (chroma) unless merging the signal paths with a filter was done.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4155">'''Denailing''' is the extraction of the nails from the fingers and/or toes, either as a medical procedure to treat severe nail infections, or as a method of [[torture]]. The United Nations [[Istanbul Protocol]] describes nail removal and the insertion of objects such as wire under the nail as forms of torture. Removed nails are capable of growing back normally over several months if the [[nail matrix]] is left intact through surgical extraction. However, if the matrix is damaged by trauma, it can result in an overgrowth of tissue from the proximal nail fold, resulting in the formation of [[pterygium]]. Particularly, if the nail matrix is burnt by a heated instrument, subsequent growth may produce nails which are striped, thin, or broken into longitudinal segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Istanbul Protocol: Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|date=2004|publisher=United Nations|location=New York and Geneva|pages=29–38|edition=Professional Training Series No. 8/Rev.1|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/training8Rev1en.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval sources described the denailing interrogation process as conducted by laying the prisoner on a tabletop—securing the hands by chains around the wrists and the bare feet by chains around the ankles—and using a metal forceps or pliers&amp;mdash;often heated red-hot&amp;mdash;to individually grasp each nail in turn and slowly pry it from the nail bed before tearing it off the finger or toe. A more painful variant used in medieval Spain was performed by introducing a sharp wedge of wood or metal between the flesh and each nail and slowly hammering the wedge under the nail until it was torn free.&lt;ref&gt;A. Hirsch, ''ed.'', ''The Book of Torture and Executions'' (Toronto: Golden Books, 1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cruel variant involved using rough skewers of wood or bone dipped in boiling sulfur. A number of such skewers were slowly driven into the flesh under the prisoner's toenails. Alternately, the skewer was dipped in boiling oil, which served a dual purpose of both burning the incredibly sensitive flesh and lubricating the needle so that the torturer could freely explore a wide surface area beneath the toenail. When enough skewers had been driven home to pry each nail loose from its bed, the nail was torn out at the root with a pair of pliers. This was a favorite technique of torture in the German witch-hunter's arsenal, being extremely inexpensive, portable, and easy to inflict.  It is also recorded that, in more recent times—particularly, during the [[Armenian genocide]] of the 1910s—phonograph needles were driven under fingernails and toenails to torture the prisoner before his nails were torn out with pliers.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Scott, ''A History of Torture'' (London: Merchant, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|Italy's republican referendum]] after World War II, efforts to prosecute former officials in the Fascist government for [[collaborationism]] and [[war crimes]] resulted in the legal differentiation between the concepts of normal brutality, cruel brutality, and ''particularly cruel brutality''. Only in the case of particularly cruel brutality would the accused be rejected for amnesty. Denailing was generally considered to fall under the first two categories, as for a brutality to be considered ''particularly cruel'', it had to "horrify even those who are familiar with torture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caroli|first1=Paolo|title=The Role of the Judiciary Within the Construction of Collective Memory.

Russell was born near Glasgow. He studied at [[Greenock Academy]] and later at [[Glasgow University]] under Sir [[John Graham Kerr|Graham Kerr]] and worked with [[John Arthur Thomson|J. Arthur Thompson]] after he graduated. He was influenced by his friend [[Patrick Geddes]] and in his zoological studies, sought to find holistic principles. He also believed in [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] heritability. He was involved in fishery research, working on research vessels and publishing on the biology of cephalopods and quantitative methods for gathering fishery data. He also worked as [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Fisheries]] expert, Inspector of Fisheries and as an advisor to [[HM Government]]. He was an honorary lecturer on animal behaviour at the [[University College, London]] for about fifteen years. He was elected President of the Zoology section of the [[British Science Association|British Association]] in 1934. From 1940—42, he served as the President of the [[Linnean Society]]. He died at Hastings, East Sussex, from heart failure at the age of 67.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|title=Fisheries Scientist|date= 27 August 1954|page=8|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sj1AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VlkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3036%2C5705269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell favored [[holism]] and [[organicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Roll-Hansen, Nils. (1984). ''E. S. Russell and J. H. Woodger: the failure of two twentieth-century opponents of mechanistic biology''. Journal of the History of Biology 17: 399-428.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a critic of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] and presented his own evolutionary theory uniting [[developmental biology]] with heredity but opposing [[Mendelian inheritance]]. He was influenced by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, Maurizio. (2013). ''Heredity, development and evolution: the unmodern synthesis of E.S. Russell''.

'''Ecosystem services''' are the many and varied benefits that humans freely gain from the natural environment and from properly-functioning [[ecosystems]]. Such ecosystems include, for example, [[agroecosystem]]s, [[forest ecosystem]]s, [[grassland ecosystem]]s and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. Collectively, these benefits are becoming known as 'ecosystem services', and are often integral to the provisioning of clean [[drinking water]], the [[decomposition]] of wastes, and the natural pollination of crops and other plants.

While scientists and [[environmentalists]] have discussed ecosystem services implicitly for decades, the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] (MA) in the early 2000s popularized the concept.&lt;ref name="Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005"&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). 2005.

[[Island Press]], Washington. 155pp.&lt;/ref&gt; There, ecosystem services are grouped into four broad categories: ''provisioning'', such as the production of food and water; ''regulating'', such as the control of climate and disease; ''supporting'', such as [[nutrient cycles]] and [[oxygen]] production; and ''cultural'', such as spiritual and recreational benefits. To help inform [[Decision-making|decision-makers]], many ecosystem services are being assigned economic values.

==History==

While the notion of human dependence on Earth's ecosystems reaches to the start of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''{{'}} existence, the term 'natural capital' was first coined by [[E. F. Schumacher|E.F. Schumacher]] in 1973 in his book ''[[Small Is Beautiful|Small is Beautiful]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E.F (1973). ''Small is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered''.&lt;/ref&gt;''.''  Recognition of how ecosystems could provide complex services to humankind date back to at least [[Plato]] (c. 400 BC) who understood that [[deforestation]] could lead to soil [[erosion]] and the drying of springs.&lt;ref name="Daily1997"&gt;Daily, G.C. 1997. Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems. Island Press, Washington. 392pp.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed| date=February 2015}}  Modern ideas of ecosystem services probably began when Marsh challenged in 1864 the idea that Earth's natural resources are unbounded by pointing out changes in [[soil fertility]] in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, G.P. 1864 (1965). Man and Nature. [[Charles Scribner's Sons]], New York. 472pp.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2015}} It was not until the late 1940s that three key authors—[[Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr]],&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, F. 1948. [[Our Plundered Planet]]. Little, Brown and Company: Boston. 217pp.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Vogt]],&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, W. 1948. Road to Survival. William Sloan: New York. 335pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aldo Leopold]] &lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. 1949. A Sand County Almanac and Sketches from Here and There. [[Oxford University Press]], New York. 226pp.&lt;/ref&gt;—promoted recognition of human dependence on the environment.

In 1956, [[Paul Sears]] drew attention to the critical role of the ecosystem in processing wastes and recycling nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, P.B. 1956. "The processes of environmental change by man." ''In'': W.L. Thomas, editor. Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth (Volume 2). [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago. 1193pp.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] and Rosa Weigert called attention to "ecological systems" in their environmental science textbook&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, P.R. and A. Ehrlich. 1970. Population, Resources, Environment: Issues in Human Ecology. [[W. H. Freeman and Company|W.H. Freeman]], San Francisco. 383pp. - see p.157&lt;/ref&gt; and "the most subtle and dangerous threat to man's existence... the potential destruction, by man's own activities, of those ecological systems upon which the very existence of the human species depends".

The term "'''environmental services'''" was introduced in a 1970 report of the ''Study of Critical Environmental Problems'',&lt;ref&gt;Study of Critical Environmental Problems (SCEP). 1970. Man's Impact on the Global Environment. MIT Press, Cambridge. 319pp.&lt;/ref&gt; which listed services including insect pollination, [[fisheries]], [[climate]] regulation and [[flood]] control. In following years, variations of the term were used, but eventually 'ecosystem services' became the standard in scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, P.R. and A. Ehrlich. 1981. Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species. [[Random House]], New York. 305pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecosystem services concept has continued to expand and includes [[socio-economic]] and [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] objectives, which are discussed below. A history of the concepts and terminology of ecosystem services as of 1997, can be found in Daily's book "Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems".&lt;ref name="Daily1997"/&gt;

While [[Gretchen Daily]]'s original definition distinguished between ecosystem goods and ecosystem services, [[Robert Costanza]] and colleagues' later work and that of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment lumped all of these together as ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="Brown2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown |first1=Thomas C. |author2=John C.

==Definition==
Per the 2006 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), ecosystem services are "the benefits people obtain from ecosystems". The MA also delineated the four categories of ecosystem services—supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural—discussed below.

By 2010, there had evolved various working definitions and descriptions of ecosystem services in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Ojea, E. Classifying Ecosystem Services for Economic Valuation: the case of forest water services. BIOECON Conference, Venice 27–28 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent double counting in ecosystem services audits, for instance, [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] (TEEB) replaced "Supporting Services" in the MA with "Habitat Services" and "ecosystem functions", defined as "a subset of the interactions between ecosystem structure and processes that underpin the capacity of an ecosystem to provide goods and services".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teebtest.org/wp-content/uploads/Study%20and%20Reports/Reports/Ecological%20and%20Economic%20Foundations/TEEB%20Ecological%20and%20Economic%20Foundations%20report/TEEB%20Foundations.pdf The Ecological and Economic Foundation], chapter 1, p.19, [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity|TEEB]], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four categories==
[[Image:Dungbeetle.jpg|right|thumb|[[Detritivore]]s like this [[dung beetle]] help to turn animal wastes into organic material that can be reused by primary producers.]]

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) report 2005 defines ''Ecosystem services'' as benefits people obtain from ecosystems and distinguishes four categories of ecosystem services, where the so-called supporting services are regarded as the basis for the services of the other three categories.&lt;ref name="Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005"/&gt;

=== Supporting services ===
These include services such as nutrient recycling, primary production and [[soil formation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation of ecosystem services|url=http://basicbiology.net/biology/conservation/ecosystem_services.php|website=basicbiology.net|publisher=Adam Purcell|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129194450/http://basicbiology.net/biology/conservation/ecosystem_services.php|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These services make it possible for the ecosystems to provide services such as food supply, flood regulation, and water purification.

=== Provisioning services ===
* food (including [[seafood]] and [[Game (food)|game]]), crops, wild foods, and [[spice]]s
* raw materials (including lumber, skins, fuel wood, organic matter, fodder, and fertilizer)
* genetic resources (including crop improvement genes, and health care)
* water
* [[biogenic minerals]]
* [[Medication|medicinal resources]] (including pharmaceuticals, chemical models, and test and assay organisms)
* [[energy]] ([[hydropower]], [[biofuel|biomass fuels]])
* ornamental resources (including fashion, handicraft, jewelry, pets, worship, decoration and souvenirs like furs, feathers, ivory, orchids, butterflies, aquarium fish, shells, etc.)

=== Regulating services ===
* pollination
* carbon sequestration and [[climate]] regulation
* waste [[decomposition]] and detoxification
* purification of [[water purification|water]] and [[air pollution|air]]
* [[Pest (organism)|pest]] and [[disease]] control

===Cultural services===
* cultural (including use of nature as motif in books, film, painting, folklore, national symbols, architect, advertising, etc.)
* spiritual and historical (including use of nature for religious or heritage value or natural)
* [[recreation]]al experiences (including [[ecotourism]], outdoor sports, and recreation)
* science and education (including use of natural systems for school excursions, and [[scientific discovery]])
* Therapeutic (including Ecotherapy, social forestry and animal assisted therapy)

There is discussion as to how the concept of '''cultural ecosystem services''' can be operationalized. A good review of approaches in landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation, and spiritual significance to define and assess cultural values of our environment so that they fit into the ecosystem services approach is given by Daniel et al.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, T. C. et al. 2012: ''Contributions of cultural services to the ecosystem services agenda.'' Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109: 8812–8819 [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/18/1114773109.full.pdf+html].&lt;/ref&gt; who vote for models that explicitly link ecological structures and functions with cultural values and benefits.
There also is a fundamental ''critique'' of the concept of cultural ecosystem services that builds on three arguments:&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T. 2012: ''Pivotal cultural values of nature cannot be integrated into the ecosystem services framework.'' Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109 (46): E3146.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Pivotal cultural values attaching to the natural/cultivated environment rely on an area's unique character that cannot be addressed by methods that use universal scientific parameters to determine ecological structures and functions. 
# If a natural/cultivated environment has symbolic meanings and cultural values the object of these values are not ecosystems but shaped phenomena like mountains, lakes, forests, and, mainly, symbolic landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Cosgrove, D.E. 1984: ''Social Formation and Symbolic Landscape'', London; Schama, S. 1995: ''Landscape and memory''. New York; Kirchhoff, T./Trepl, L./Vicenzotti, V. 2012:''What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions''. Landscape Research iFirst.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Those cultural values do result not from properties produced by ecosystems but are the product of a specific way of seeing within the given cultural framework of symbolic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Cosgrove, D.E. 1984: ''Social Formation and Symbolic Landscape'', London; Schama, S. 1995: ''Landscape and memory''. New York; Backhaus, G./Murungi, J. (eds.): ''Symbolic Landscapes''. Dordrecht 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The following examples illustrate the relationships between humans and natural ecosystems through the services derived from them:
* In [[New York City]], where the quality of drinking water had fallen below standards required by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]], authorities opted to restore the polluted [[Catskill Park|Catskill Watershed]] that had previously provided the city with the ecosystem service of water purification. Once the input of sewage and pesticides to the [[Drainage basin|watershed]] area was reduced, natural [[abiotic]] processes such as soil [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and [[filtration]] of chemicals, together with biotic recycling via [[root| root systems]] and [[soil]] [[microorganisms]], [[water quality]] improved to levels that met government standards. The cost of this investment in [[natural capital]] was estimated between $1–1.5 billion, which contrasted dramatically with the estimated $6–8 billion cost of constructing a [[water filtration]] plant plus the $300 million annual running costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graciela Chichilnisky|Chichilnisky, G.]] and G. Heal. 1998. Economic returns from the biosphere. [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 391: 629-630.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pollination of [[crops]] by [[bees]] is required for 15–30% of U.S. [[food production]]; most large-scale farmers import non-native honey bees to provide this service. One study &lt;ref name="Kremen 2005"&gt;Kremen, C. 2005. Managing ecosystem services: what do we need to know about their ecology?  [[Ecology Letters]] 8: 468-479.&lt;/ref&gt; reports that in [[California| California's]] agricultural region, it was found that wild bees alone could provide partial or complete pollination services or enhance the services provided by honey bees through behavioral interactions. However, [[Intensive farming|intensified agricultural practices]] can quickly erode pollination services through the loss of species. The remaining species are unable to compensate this. The results of this study also indicate that the proportion of [[chaparral]] and [[California oak woodland|oak-woodland habitat]] available for wild bees within 1–2&amp;nbsp;km of a [[farm]] can stabilize and enhance the provision of pollination services. The presence of such ecosystem elements functions almost like an insurance policy for farmers.
* In watersheds of the [[Yangtze River]] ([[China]]), [[Spatial analysis|spatial models]] for water flow through different forest habitats were created to determine potential contributions for [[hydroelectric power]] in the region. By quantifying the relative value of ecological parameters (vegetation-soil-slope complexes), researchers were able to estimate the annual economic benefit of maintaining forests in the watershed for power services to be 2.2 times that if it were harvested once for [[timber]].&lt;ref&gt;Guo, Z.W., X.M. Xio and D.M. Li. 2000. An assessment of ecosystem services: water flow regulation and hydroelectric power production. Ecological Applications 10: 925-936.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1980s, mineral water company Vittel (now a brand of Nestlé Waters) faced a critical problem. Nitrates and pesticides were entering the company's springs in northeastern France. Local farmers had intensified agricultural practices and cleared native vegetation that previously had filtered water before it seeped into the aquifer used by Vittel. This contamination threatened the company's right to use the "natural mineral water" label under French law.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, C, J Ranganathan, C Iceland, and J Finisdore. (2008) The Corporate Ecosystem Services Review (Version 1.0). [[World Resources Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this business risk, Vittel developed an incentive package for farmers to improve their agricultural practices and consequently reduce water pollution that had affected Vittel's product. For example, Vittel provided subsidies and free technical assistance to farmers in exchange for farmers' agreement to enhance pasture management, reforest catchments, and reduce the use of agrochemicals. This is an example of a [[payment for ecosystem services]] program.&lt;ref&gt;Perrot-Maître, D. (2006) The Vittel payments for ecosystem services: a "perfect" PES case? [[International Institute for Environment and Development]], London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was counted that to plant 15 000 ha new woodland in the UK, if we consider only the value of timber, it would cost  £79 000 000 which is more than the benefit of £65 000 000. If, however, we include all other benefits the trees in lowland could provide (like soil stabilization, wind deflection, recreation, food production, air purification, carbon storage, wildlife habitat, fuel production, cooling, flood prevention), the costs will increase due to displacing the profitable farmland (would be around £231 000 000) but will be overweight by benefits of £546 000 000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=EU Environment|title=Ecosystem services and Biodiversity - Science for Environment Policy|date=2016-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6luBEJfi3s&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2016-09-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806014145/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6luBEJfi3s&amp;feature=youtu.be|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Europe, various projects are implemented in order to define the values of concrete ecosystems and to implement this concept into decision making process. For example,  "LIFE Viva grass" project aims to do this with grasslands in Baltics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vivagrass.eu/|title=LIFE Viva Grass {{!}} Integrated planning tool for grassland ecosystem services|website=vivagrass.eu|access-date=2016-09-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807201444/http://vivagrass.eu/|archivedate=7 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Understanding of ecosystem services requires a strong foundation in [[ecology]], which describes the underlying principles and interactions of organisms and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. Since the scales at which these entities interact can vary from [[microbes]] to [[landscapes]], milliseconds to millions of years, one of the greatest remaining challenges is the descriptive characterization of energy and material flow between them.  For example, the area of a forest floor, the [[detritus]] upon it, the microorganisms in the soil and characteristics of the soil itself will all contribute to the abilities of that forest for providing ecosystem services like carbon sequestration, water purification, and [[erosion]] prevention to other areas within the watershed. Note that it is often possible for multiple services to be bundled together and when benefits of targeted objectives are secured, there may also be ancillary benefits—the same forest may provide [[habitat]] for other organisms as well as human recreation, which are also ecosystem services.

The complexity of Earth's ecosystems poses a challenge for scientists as they try to understand how relationships are interwoven among organisms, processes and their surroundings. As it relates to human ecology, a suggested research agenda &lt;ref name="Kremen 2005"/&gt; for the study of ecosystem services includes the following steps:
# identification of ''ecosystem service providers'' (''ESP''s)—[[species]] or populations that provide specific ecosystem services—and characterization of their functional roles and relationships;
# determination of community structure aspects that influence how ESPs function in their [[natural landscape]], such as compensatory responses that stabilize function and non-random extinction sequences which can erode it;
# assessment of key environmental (abiotic) factors influencing the provision of services;
# measurement of the spatial and temporal scales ESPs and their services operate on.

Recently, a technique has been developed to improve and standardize the evaluation of ESP functionality by quantifying the relative importance of different species in terms of their efficiency and abundance.&lt;ref name="Balvanera"&gt;Balvanera, P. C. Kremen, and M. Martinez. 2005. Applying community structure analysis to ecosystem function: examples from pollination and carbon storage. Ecological Applications 15: 360-375.&lt;/ref&gt; Such parameters provide indications of how species respond to changes in the environment (i.e. predators, resource availability, climate) and are useful for identifying species that are disproportionately important at providing ecosystem services. However, a critical drawback is that the technique does not account for the effects of interactions, which are often both complex and fundamental in maintaining an ecosystem and can involve species that are not readily detected as a priority. Even so, estimating the functional structure of an ecosystem and combining it with information about individual species traits can help us understand the [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] of an ecosystem amidst environmental change.

Many ecologists also believe that the provision of ecosystem services can be stabilized with [[biodiversity]]. Increasing biodiversity also benefits the variety of ecosystem services available to society. Understanding the relationship between biodiversity and an ecosystem's stability is essential to the management of natural resources and their services.

===Redundancy hypothesis===
The concept of ecological redundancy is sometimes referred to as ''functional compensation'' and assumes that more than one species performs a given role within an ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, B.H. 1992. "Biodiversity and ecological redundancy." [[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] 6: 18-23.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it is characterized by a particular species increasing its efficiency at providing a service when conditions are stressed in order to maintain aggregate stability in the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, T.M., [[Stephen R. Carpenter|S.R. Carpenter]], A.R. Ives, and T.K. Kratz. 1995. "Species compensation and complementarity in ecosystem function." ''In'': C. Jones and J. Lawton, editors. Linking species and ecosystems. [[Chapman &amp; Hall]], London. 387pp.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such increased dependence on a compensating species places additional stress on the ecosystem and often enhances its susceptibility to subsequent [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. The redundancy hypothesis can be summarized as "species redundancy enhances ecosystem resilience".&lt;ref name="Naeem 1998"&gt;Naeem S. 1998. "Species redundancy and ecosystem reliability" [[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] 12: 39–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another idea uses the analogy of rivets in an airplane wing to compare the exponential effect the loss of each species will have on the function of an ecosystem; this is sometimes referred to as ''rivet popping''.&lt;ref name="Lawton 1994"&gt;Lawton, J.H. 1994. What do species do in ecosystems? [[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] 71: 367-374.&lt;/ref&gt; If only one species disappears, the loss of the ecosystem's efficiency as a whole is relatively small; however, if several species are lost, the system essentially collapses—similar to an airplane that lost too many rivets. The hypothesis assumes that species are relatively specialized in their roles and that their ability to compensate for one another is less than in the redundancy hypothesis. As a result, the loss of any species is critical to the performance of the ecosystem. The key difference is the rate at which the loss of species affects total ecosystem functioning.

===Portfolio effect===
A third explanation, known as the ''portfolio effect'', compares biodiversity to stock holdings, where diversification minimizes the volatility of the investment, or in this case, the risk of instability of ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman, D., C.L. Lehman, and C.E. Bristow. 1998. Diversity-stability relationships: statistical inevitability or ecological consequence?" ''The American Naturalist'' 151: 277-282.&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the idea of ''response diversity'' where a suite of species will exhibit differential responses to a given environmental perturbation. When considered together, they create a stabilizing function that preserves the integrity of a service.&lt;ref&gt;Elmqvist, T., C. Folke, M. Nyström, G. Peterson, J. Bengtsson, B. Walker and J. Norberg. 2003. Response diversity, ecosystem change, and resilience. [[Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment]] 1: 488-494.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several experiments have tested these hypotheses in both the field and the lab. In ECOTRON, a laboratory in the UK where many of the [[biotic component|biotic]] and abiotic factors of nature can be simulated, studies have focused on the effects of earthworms and [[symbiotic bacteria]] on plant roots.&lt;ref name="Lawton 1994"/&gt;  These laboratory experiments seem to favor the rivet hypothesis. However, a study on grasslands at Cedar Creek Reserve in Minnesota supports the redundancy hypothesis, as have many other field studies.&lt;ref&gt;Grime, J.P. 1997. "Biodiversity and ecosystem function: The debate deepened." Science 277&lt;/ref&gt;

Untangling the Environmentalist's Paradox: Why is Human Well-being Increasing as Ecosystem Services Degrade? Bioscience 60(8)  576–589.&lt;/ref&gt; Some people may be unaware of the environment in general and humanity's interrelatedness with the natural environment, which may cause misconceptions. Although environmental awareness is rapidly improving in our contemporary world, ecosystem capital and its flow are still poorly understood, threats continue to impose, and we suffer from the so-called '[[tragedy of the commons]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, G. 1968. The tragedy of the commons" ''Science'' 162: 1243-1248.&lt;/ref&gt; Many efforts to inform decision-makers of current versus future costs and benefits now involve organizing and translating scientific knowledge to [[economics]], which articulate the consequences of our choices in comparable units of impact on human well-being.&lt;ref name="Daily et al. 2000."&gt;Daily, G.C., T. Söderqvist, S. Aniyar, K. Arrow, P. Dasgupta, P.R. Ehrlich, C. Folke, A. Jansson, B. Jansson, N. Kautsky, S. Levin, J. Lubchenco, K. Mäler, D. Simpson, D. Starrett, D. Tilman, and B. Walker. 2000. The value of nature and the nature of value" ''Science'' 289: 395-396.&lt;/ref&gt; An especially challenging aspect of this process is that interpreting ecological information collected from one spatial-temporal scale does not necessarily mean it can be applied at another; understanding the dynamics of ecological processes relative to ecosystem services is essential in aiding economic decisions.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, R.S., J.A. Foley, and G.P. Asner. 2004. Land-use choices: balancing human needs and ecosystem function. [[Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment]] 2: 249-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Weighting factors such as a service's irreplaceability or bundled services can also allocate economic value such that goal attainment becomes more efficient.

The economic valuation of ecosystem services also involves social communication and information, areas that remain particularly challenging and are the focus of many researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorriz-Misfud|first1=Elena|last2=Varela|first2=Elsa|last3=Piqué|first3=Miriam|last4=Prokofieva|first4=Irina|title=Demand and supply of ecosystem services in a Mediterranean forest: Computing payment boundaries.|journal=Ecosystem Services|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.ecoser.2015.11.006|url=http://arxiudigital.ctfc.cat/docs/upload/27_522_Gorriz%20et%20al%202016_Demand%20and%20supply%20of%20ES%20in%20a%20Med%20forest_Computing%20payment%20boundaries.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806071955/http://arxiudigital.ctfc.cat/docs/upload/27_522_Gorriz%20et%20al%202016_Demand%20and%20supply%20of%20ES%20in%20a%20Med%20forest_Computing%20payment%20boundaries.pdf|archivedate=6 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the idea is that although individuals make decisions for any variety of reasons, trends reveal the aggregative preferences of a society, from which the economic value of services can be inferred and assigned. The six major methods for valuing ecosystem services in monetary terms are:&lt;ref&gt;Farber, S.C., R. Costanza and M.A. Wilson. 2002. Economic and ecological concepts for valuing ecosystem services.

* Avoided cost: Services allow society to avoid costs that would have been incurred in the absence of those services (e.g. waste treatment by [[wetland]] habitats avoids health costs)
* Replacement cost: Services could be replaced with man-made systems (e.g. [[Restoration Ecology|restoration]] of the [[Catskill Watershed]] cost less than the construction of a [[water purification]] plant)
* Factor income: Services provide for the enhancement of incomes (e.g. improved [[water quality]] increases the commercial take of a [[fishery]] and improves the income of fishers)
* Travel cost: Service demand may require travel, whose costs can reflect the implied value of the service (e.g. value of [[ecotourism]] experience is at least what a visitor is willing to pay to get there)
* Hedonic pricing: Service demand may be reflected in the prices people will pay for associated goods (e.g. coastal housing prices exceed that of inland homes)
* Contingent valuation: Service demand may be elicited by posing hypothetical scenarios that involve some valuation of alternatives (e.g. visitors willing to pay for increased access to national parks)

A peer-reviewed study published in 1997 estimated the value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital to be between US$16–54 trillion per year, with an average of US$33 trillion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Costanza |first=Robert |first2=Ralph |last2=d'Arge |first3=Rudolf |last3=de Groot |first4=Stephen |last4=Farberk |first5=Monica |last5=Grasso |first6=Bruce |last6=Hannon |first7=Karin |last7=Limburg |first8=Shahid |last8=Naeem |first9=Robert V. |last9=O'Neill |first10=Jose |last10=Paruelo |first11=Robert G. |last11=Raskin |first12=Paul |last12=Sutton |first13=Marjan |last13=van den Belt |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |date=15 May 1997 |volume=387 |pages=253–260 |url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |accessdate=8 August 2012 |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730185431/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |archivedate=30 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Salles (2011) indicates 'The total value of biodiversity is infinite, so having debate about what is the total value of nature is actually pointless because we can't live without it'.

==Management and policy==

Although monetary pricing continues with respect to the valuation of ecosystem services, the challenges in policy implementation and management are significant and multitudinous. The administration of [[common pool resources]] is a subject of extensive academic pursuit.&lt;ref name="Ostrom 1990"&gt;Ostrom, E. 1990. Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action. [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge. 279pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietz, T. E. Ostrom and P.C. Stern. 2003. The struggle to govern the commons" ''Science'' 302: 1907-1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pretty, J. 2003. Social capital and the collective management of resources" ''Science'' 302: 1912-1914.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heikkila, T. 2004. Institutional boundaries and common-pool resource management: a comparative analysis of water management programs in California. ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'' from [[Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management]] 23: 97-117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, C.C., J.T. Williams and E. Ostrom. 2005. Local management and better forests. [[World Development (journal)|World Development]] 33: 273-284.&lt;/ref&gt; From defining the problems to finding solutions that can be applied in practical and sustainable ways, there is much to overcome. Considering options must balance present and future human needs, and decision-makers must frequently work from valid but incomplete information. Existing legal policies are often considered insufficient since they typically pertain to human health-based standards that are mismatched with necessary means to protect [[ecosystem health]] and services. To improve the information available, one suggestion has involved the implementation of an ''Ecosystem Services Framework'' (ESF&lt;ref name="Daily 2000"&gt;Daily, G.C. 2000. Management objectives for the protection of ecosystem services. Environmental Science &amp; Policy 3: 333-339.&lt;/ref&gt;), which integrates the biophysical and [[socio-economic]] dimensions of protecting the environment and is designed to guide [[institutions]] through multidisciplinary information and jargon, helping to direct strategic choices.

Novel and expedient methods are needed to deal with managing Earth's ecosystem services. Local to regional collective management efforts might be considered appropriate for services like crop [[pollination]] or resources like water.&lt;ref name="Kremen 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ostrom 1990"/&gt; Another approach that has become increasingly popular over the last decade is the marketing of ecosystem services protection. Payment and trading of services is an emerging worldwide small-scale solution where one can acquire credits for activities such as sponsoring the protection of carbon sequestration sources or the [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] of ecosystem service providers. In some cases, banks for handling such credits have been established and conservation companies have even gone public on stock exchanges, defining an evermore parallel link with economic endeavors and opportunities for tying into social perceptions.&lt;ref name="Daily et al. 2000."/&gt; However, crucial for implementation are clearly defined [[land rights]], which is often lacking in many [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Jessica Brown and Neil Bird 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5049&amp;title=costa-rica-sustainable-resource-management-successfully-tackling-tropical-deforestation Costa Rica sustainable resource management: Successfully tackling tropical deforestation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514083601/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5049&amp;title=costa-rica-sustainable-resource-management-successfully-tackling-tropical-deforestation |date=14 May 2011 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, many forest-rich developing countries suffering [[deforestation]] experience conflict between different forest stakeholders.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; In addition, concerns for such global transactions include inconsistent compensation for services or resources sacrificed elsewhere and misconceived warrants for irresponsible use. Another approach has been focused on protecting ecosystem service '[[biodiversity hotspot|hotspots]]'. Recognition that the conservation of many ecosystem services aligns with more traditional conservation goals (i.e. [[biodiversity]]) has led to the suggested merging of objectives for maximizing their mutual success. This may be particularly strategic when employing networks that permit the flow of services across [[landscapes]], and might also facilitate securing the financial means to protect services through a diversification of investors.&lt;ref&gt;Balvanera, P., G.C. Daily, P.R. Ehrlich, T.H. Ricketts, S.Bailey, S. Kark, C. Kremen and H. Pereira. 2001. Conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services. [[Science (journal)|Science]] 291: 2047.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan, K.M.A., M.R. Shaw, D.R. Cameron, E.C. Underwood and G.C. Daily. 2006. Conservation planning for ecosystem services. [[PLoS Biology]] 4: 2138-2152.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in recent years there has been interest in the valuation of ecosystem services provided by [[shellfish]] production and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Northern Economics Inc|title=Valuation of Ecosystem Services from Shellfish Restoration, Enhancement and Management: A Review of the Literature|url=http://www.pacshell.org/pdf/ShellfishEcoServices.pdf|publisher=Prepared for Pacific Shellfish Institute|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203085756/http://www.pacshell.org/pdf/ShellfishEcoServices.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A keystone species, low in the food chain, bivalve shellfish such as oysters support a complex community of species by performing a number of functions essential to the diverse array of species that surround them. There is also increasing recognition that some shellfish species may impact or control many ecological processes; so much so that they are included on the list of "ecosystem engineers"—organisms that physically, biologically or chemically modify the environment around them in ways that influence the health of other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|author2=Lawton, and Shachak|title=Organisms as Ecosystem Engineers|journal=Oikos|year=1994|volume=69|issue=3|pages=373–386|doi=10.2307/3545850}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the ecological functions and processes performed or affected by shellfish contribute to human well-being by providing a stream of valuable ecosystem services over time by filtering out particulate materials and potentially mitigating water quality issues by controlling [[nutrient pollution|excess nutrients]] in the water.

===Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA)===

Ecosystem-based adaptation or EbA is an emerging strategy for community development and environmental management that seeks to use an ecosystem services framework to help communities adapt to the effects of [[climate change]]. The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] currently defines Ecosystem-Based Adaptation as "the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change", which includes the use of "sustainable management, conservation and restoration of ecosystems, as part of an overall adaptation strategy that takes into account the multiple social, economic and cultural co-benefits for local communities".&lt;ref name="ebaflagship.org"&gt;http://ebaflagship.org/images/ContentsForPublications/eba%20policy%20brochure%20web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment announced that humanity's impact on the natural world was increasing to levels never before seen, and that the degradation of the planet's ecosystems would become a major barrier to achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. In recognition of this fact, Ecosystem-Based Adaptation seeks to use the restoration of ecosystems as a stepping-stone to improving the quality of life in communities experiencing the impacts of climate change. Specifically, this involves the restoration of ecosystems that provide the community with essential services, such as the provisioning of food and water and protection from [[storm surges]] and flooding. EbA interventions typically combine elements of both [[climate change mitigation]] and [[adaptation to global warming]] to help address the community's current and future needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/climatechange/adaptation/EcosystemBasedAdaptation/tabid/29583/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604195815/http://www.unep.org/climatechange/adaptation/EcosystemBasedAdaptation/tabid/29583/Default.aspx |archivedate=4 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative planning between scientists, policy makers, and community members is an essential element of Ecosystem-Based Adaptation. By drawing on the expertise of outside experts and local residents alike, EbA seeks to develop unique solutions to unique problems, rather than simply replicating past projects.&lt;ref name="ebaflagship.org"/&gt;

==Estuarine and coastal ecosystem services==

Ecosystem services are defined as the gains acquired by humankind from surroundings ecosystems. Four different types of ecosystem services have been distinguished by the scientific body: regulating services, provisioning services, cultural services and supporting services. An ecosystem does not necessarily offer all four types of services simultaneously; but given the intricate nature of any ecosystem, it is usually assumed that humans benefit from a combination of these services. The services offered by diverse types of ecosystems (forests, seas, coral reefs, mangroves, etc.) differ in nature and in consequence. In fact, some services directly affect the livelihood of neighboring human populations (such as fresh water, food or aesthetic value, etc.) while other services affect general environmental conditions by which humans are indirectly impacted (such as climate change, erosion regulation or natural hazard regulation, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Barbier, E.B.; Hacker, S.D.; Kennedy, C.; Koch, E.W.; Stier, A.C. &amp; Silliman, B.R. [http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/10-1510.1] ''Ecological Monographs'', 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Estuarine and coastal ecosystems are both marine ecosystems. An [[estuary]] is defined as the area in which a river meets the sea or the ocean. The waters surrounding this area are predominantly salty waters or brackish waters; and the incoming river water is dynamically motioned by the tide. An estuary strip may be covered by populations of reed (or similar plants) and/or sandbanks (or similar form or land).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

A coastal ecosystem occurs in areas where the sea or ocean waters meet the land.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Regulating services===
Regulating services are the "benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.html|title=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|author=|date=|website=www.millenniumassessment.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224041032/http://millenniumassessment.org/en/index.html|archivedate=24 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of coastal and estuarine ecosystems, these services include climate regulation, waste treatment and disease control and natural hazard regulation.

====Climate regulation====
Both the biotic and abiotic ensembles of marine ecosystems play a role in climate regulation. They act as sponges when it comes to gases in the atmosphere, retaining large levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases (methane and nitrous oxide). Marine plants also use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for photosynthesis purposes and help in reducing the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The oceans and seas absorb the heat from the atmosphere and redistribute it through the means of water currents, and atmospheric processes, such as evaporation and the reflection of light allow for the cooling and warming of the overlying atmosphere. The ocean temperatures are thus imperative to the regulation of the atmospheric temperatures in any part of the world: "without the ocean, the Earth would be unbearably hot during the daylight hours and frigidly cold, if not frozen, at night".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"&gt;MOlnar, Michelle; Clarke-Murray, Cathryn; Whitworth, Jogn &amp; Tam, Jordan. {{cite web |url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230158/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waste treatment and disease regulation====
Another service offered by marine ecosystem is the treatment of wastes, thus helping in the regulation of diseases. Wastes can be diluted and detoxified through transport across marine ecosystems; pollutants are removed from the environment and stored, buried or recycled in marine ecosystems: "Marine ecosystems break down organic waste through microbial communities that filter water, reduce/limit the effects of eutrophication, and break down toxic hydrocarbons into their basic components such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/&gt; The fact that waste is diluted with large volumes of water and moves with water currents leads to the regulation of diseases and the reduction of toxics in seafood.

====Buffer zones====
Coastal and estuarine ecosystems act as buffer zones against natural hazards and environmental disturbances, such as floods, cyclones, tidal surges and storms. The role they play is to "[absorb] a portion of the impact and thus [lessen] its effect on the land".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/&gt; Wetlands, for example, and the vegetation it supports – trees, root mats, etc. – retain large amounts of water (surface water, snowmelt, rain, groundwater) and then slowly releases them back, decreasing the likeliness of floods.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, A.C.; Hernandez, M.E.; Moreno-Casasola, P.; Espinosa, E.C.; Robledo, A.R. &amp; Mata, D.I. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02626667.2011.629786] ''Hydrological Sciences Journal'', December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Mangrove forests protect coastal shorelines from tidal erosion or erosion by currents; a process that was studied after the 1999 cyclone that hit India. Villages that were surrounded with mangrove forests encountered less damages than other villages that weren't protected by mangroves.&lt;ref&gt;Badol, Ruchi &amp; Hussain, S.A. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=314311&amp;jid=ENC&amp;volumeId=32&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=314310], ''Environmental Conservation'', February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provisioning Services===
Provisioning services consist of all "the products obtained from ecosystems". Marine ecosystems provide people with: wild &amp; cultured seafood, fresh water, fiber &amp; fuel and biochemical &amp; genetic resources.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Marine products====
Humans consume a large number of products originating from the seas, whether as a nutritious product or for use in other sectors: "More than one billion people worldwide, or one-sixth of the global population, rely on fish as their main source of animal protein. In 2000, marine and coastal fisheries accounted for 12 per cent of world food production".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Molnar, Michelle; Clarke-Murray, Cathryn; Whitworth, Jogn &amp; Tam, Jordan. {{cite web |url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230158/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Fish and other edible marine products – primarily fish, shellfish, roe and seaweeds – constitute for populations living along the coast the main elements of the local cultural diets, norms and traditions. A very pertinent example would be sushi, the national food of Japan, which consists mostly of different types of fish and seaweed.

====Fresh water====
Water bodies that are not highly concentrated in salts are referred to as 'fresh water' bodies. Fresh water may run through lakes, rivers and streams, to name a few; but it is most prominently found in the frozen state or as soil moisture or buried deep underground. Fresh water is not only important for the survival of humans, but also for the survival of all the existing species of animals, plants.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Raw materials====
Marine creatures provide us with the raw materials needed for the manufacturing of clothing, building materials (lime extracted from coral reefs), ornamental items and personal-use items (luffas, art and jewelry): "The skin of marine mammals for clothing, gas deposits for energy production, lime (extracted from coral reefs) for building construction, and the timber of mangroves and coastal forests for shelter are some of the more familiar uses of marine organisms. Raw marine materials are utilized for non-essential goods as well, such as shells and corals in ornamental items".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Humans have also referred to processes within marine environments for the production of renewable energy: using the power of waves – or tidal power – as a source of energy for the powering of a turbine, for example.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Oceans and seas are used as sites for offshore oil and gas installations, offshore wind farms.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Biochemical and genetic resources====
Biochemical resources are compounds extracted from marine organisms for use in medicines, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and other biochemical products. Genetic resources are the genetic information found in marine organisms that would later on be used for animal and plant breeding and for technological advances in the biological field. These resources are either directly taken out from an organism – such as fish oil as a source of omega3 –, or used as a model for innovative man-made products: "such as the construction of fiber optics technology based on the properties of sponges. ... Compared to terrestrial products, marine-sourced products tend to be more highly bioactive, likely due to the fact that marine organisms have to retain their potency despite being diluted in the surrounding sea-water".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Cultural services===
Cultural services relate to the non-material world, as they benefit the benefit recreational, aesthetic, cognitive and spiritual activities, which are not easily quantifiable in monetary terms.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Inspirational====
Marine environments have been used by many as an inspiration for their works of art, music, architecture, traditions... Water environments are spiritually important as a lot of people view them as a means for rejuvenation and change of perspective. Many also consider the water as being a part of their personality, especially if they have lived near it since they were kids: they associate it to fond memories and past experiences. Living near water bodies for a long time results in a certain set of water activities that become a ritual in the lives of people and of the culture in the region.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Recreation and tourism====
Sea sports are very popular among coastal populations: surfing, snorkeling, whale watching, kayaking, recreational fishing...a lot of tourists also travel to resorts close to the sea or rivers or lakes to be able to experience these activities, and relax near the water.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} [[File:Tourism on Greek Beaches.jpg|thumb|Beach accommodated into a recreational area.]]

====Science and education====
A lot can be learned from marine processes, environments and organisms – that could be implemented into our daily actions and into the scientific domain. Although much is still yet to still be known about the ocean world: "by the extraordinary intricacy and complexity of the marine environment and how it is influenced by large spatial scales, time lags, and cumulative effects".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/&gt;

===Supporting services===
Supporting services are the services that allow for the other ecosystem services to be present. They have indirect impacts on humans that last over a long period of time. Several services can be considered as being both supporting services and regulating/cultural/provisioning services.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Nutrient cycling====
Nutrient cycling is the movement of nutrients through an ecosystem by biotic and abiotic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scienceaid.net/biology/ecology/nutrient.html|title=Nutrient Cycles: Recycling in Ecosystems, The Carbon and Nitrogen Cycles - ScienceAid|work=ScienceAid|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ocean is a vast storage pool for these nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. The nutrients are absorbed by the basic organisms of the marine food web and are thus transferred from one organism to the other and from one ecosystem to the other. Nutrients are recycled through the life cycle of organisms as they die and decompose, releasing the nutrients into the neighboring environment. "The service of nutrient cycling eventually impacts all other ecosystem services as all living things require a constant supply of nutrients to survive".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/&gt;

====Biologically mediated habitats====
Biologically mediated habitats are defined as being the habitats that living marine structures offer to other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;UK National Ecosystem Assessment Technical Report, {{cite web |url=http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/Resources/tabid/82/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707060244/http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/Resources/tabid/82/Default.aspx |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, ''Chapters 13-16'', June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; These need not to be designed for the sole purpose of serving as a habitat, but happen to become living quarters whilst growing naturally. For example, coral reefs and mangrove forests are home to numerous species of fish, seaweed and shellfish... The importance of these habitats is that they allow for interactions between different species, aiding the provisioning of marine goods and services. They are also very important for the growth at the early life stages of marine species (breeding and bursary spaces), as they serve as a food source and as a shelter from predators.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} [[File:Example of Biologically Mediated Habitats.jpg|thumb|Coral and other living organisms serve as habitats for many marine species.]]

====Primary production====
Primary production refers to the production of organic matter, i.e., chemically bound energy, through processes such as photosynthesis and chemosynthesis. The organic matter produced by primary producers forms the basis of all food webs. Further, it generates oxygen (O2), a molecule necessary to sustain animals and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.be/books?isbn=1118506243|title=isbn:1118506243 - Google zoeken|author=|date=|website=books.google.be|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canr.msu.edu/nativeplants/ecosystem_services|title=Ecosystem Services|author=|date=|website=msu.edu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228161544/http://www.canr.msu.edu/nativeplants/ecosystem_services/|archivedate=28 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/wc.notes/1.atmosphere/oxygen_and_human_requirements.htm|title=Oxygen and Human Requirements|author=|date=|website=www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022082604/http://www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/wc.notes/1.atmosphere/oxygen_and_human_requirements.htm|archivedate=22 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/pe/appliedanatomy/1_anatomy_respiratorysys_rev3.shtml|title=BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Inhaled and exhaled air|author=|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026150605/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/pe/appliedanatomy/1_anatomy_respiratorysys_rev3.shtml|archivedate=26 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Businessworld==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
{{unbalanced|section|date=June 2013}}
Ecosystem services degradation can pose a number of risks to corporate performance as well as provide business opportunities through ecosystem restoration and enhancement. Risks and opportunities include:

* '''''Operational'''''
** Risks such as higher costs for freshwater due to scarcity or lower output for hydroelectric facilities due to siltation
** Opportunities such as increasing water-use efficiency or building an on-site wetland to circumvent the need for new water treatment infrastructure
* '''''Regulatory and legal'''''
** Risks such as new fines, government regulations, or lawsuits from local communities that lose ecosystem services due to corporate activities
** Opportunities such as engaging governments to develop policies and incentives to protect or restore ecosystems that provide services a company needs
* '''''Reputational'''''
** Risks such as retail companies being targeted by nongovernmental organization campaigns for purchasing wood or paper from sensitive forests
::Opportunities such as implementing and communicating sustainable purchasing, operating, or investment practices in order to differentiate corporate brands.
* '''''Market and product'''''
** Risks such as customers switching to other suppliers that offer products with lower ecosystem impacts or governments implementing new sustainable procurement policies
** Opportunities such as launching new products and services that reduce customer impacts on ecosystems or participating in emerging markets for carbon sequestration and watershed protection other products
* '''''Financing'''''
** Risks such as banks implementing more rigorous lending requirements for corporate loans
** Opportunities such as banks offering more favorable loan terms or investors taking positions in companies supplying products and services that improve resource use efficiency or restore degraded ecosystems

Many companies are not fully aware of the extent of their dependence and impact on ecosystems and the possible ramifications. Likewise, environmental management systems and environmental due diligence tools are more suited to handle "traditional" issues of pollution and natural [[resource consumption]]. Most focus on [[environmental impacts]], not dependence. Several newly developed tools and methodologies can help the private sector value and assess ecosystem services. These include Our Ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecometrica.com/products/our-ecosystem/ |title=Our Ecosystem - Mapping &amp; Data Sharing Software |publisher=Ecometrica |accessdate=2012-07-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617100654/http://ecometrica.com/products/our-ecosystem/ |archivedate=17 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Corporate Ecosystem Services Review (ESR),&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, C, J Ranganathan, C Iceland, and J Finisdore.

==Land use change decisions==

Ecosystem services decisions require making complex choices at the intersection of [[ecology]], [[technology]], [[society]] and the [[economy]]. The process of making ecosystem services decisions must consider the interaction of many types of information, honor all [[project stakeholder|stakeholder]] viewpoints, including [[regulatory agencies]], proposal proponents, decision makers, residents, [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, and measure the impacts on all four parts of the intersection. These decisions are usually [[spatial planning|spatial]], always [[multi-objective optimization|multi-objective]], and based on uncertain data, models, and estimates. Often it is the combination of the best science combined with the stakeholder values, estimates and opinions that drive the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorriz-Misfud|first1=Elena|last2=Secco|first2=L|last3=Pisani|first3=E|title=Exploring the interlinkages between governance and social capital: A dynamic model for forestry.|journal=Forest Policy and Economics|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.forpol.2016.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One analytical study modeled the stakeholders as [[software agent|agents]] to support water resource management decisions in the Middle Rio Grande basin of New Mexico.  This study focused on modeling the stakeholder inputs across a spatial decision, but ignored uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url= http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2012/120710.pdf|author= Tidwell, V.,  E.

In Baltic countries scientists, nature conservationists and local authorities are [http://vivagrass.eu/about-the-project/ implementing integrated planning approach for grassland ecosystems]. They are developing Integrated Planning Tool that will be based on [[GIS]] (geographic information system) technology and put online that will help for planners to choose the best grassland management solution for concrete grassland. It will look holistically at the processes in the countryside and help to find best grassland management solutions by taking into account both natural and socioeconomic factors of the particular site.

[[File:Egg-rmh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An eggshell is often used a visual metaphor for the thin skull rule.]]
The '''eggshell rule''' (or '''thin skull rule''') is a well-established [[legal doctrine]] in [[common law]], used in some [[tort law]] systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/708/708.F2d.1217.82-1714.html 708 F.2d 1217], citing Prosser, ''Handbook of the Law of Torts'' 261 (4th ed. 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; with a similar doctrine applicable to [[criminal law]].  The rule states that, in a tort case, the unexpected frailty of the injured person is not a valid defense to the seriousness of any injury caused to them.

==The law==
This rule holds that a [[tortfeasor]] is liable for all consequences resulting from their tortious (usually [[negligent]]) activities leading to an injury to another person, even if the victim suffers an unusually high level of damage (e.g. due to a pre-existing [[vulnerability]] or [[medical condition]]).&lt;ref name="Watts v Rake"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|50|1960|litigants=Watts v Rake |parallecite=(1960) 108 [[Commonwelath Law Reports|CLR]] 158, [8] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The eggshell skull rule takes into account the physical, social and economic attributes of the plaintiff which might make them more susceptible to injury.&lt;ref name="Nader"&gt;''Nader v Urban Transit Authority of NSW'' (1985) 2 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 501, [[NSW Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia) per McHugh JA. [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1985+2+NSWLR+501 LawCite records].&lt;/ref&gt;  It may also take into account the family and cultural environment.&lt;ref name="Kavanagh v Akhtar"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|779|1998|litigants=Kavanagh v Akhtar |parallelcite=(1998) 45 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 588 |courtname=[[NSW Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term implies that if a person had a skull as delicate as that of the shell of an egg, and a tortfeasor who was unaware of the condition injured that person's head, causing the skull unexpectedly to break, the defendant would be held liable for all damages resulting from the wrongful contact, even if the tortfeasor did not intend to cause such a severe injury.

In criminal law, the general maxim is that the [[defendant]] must "take their victims as they find them", as echoed in the judgment of [[Frederick Lawton (judge)|Lord Justice Lawton]] in ''[[R v. Blaue]]'' (1975), in which the defendant was held responsible for killing his victim, despite his contention that her refusal of a blood transfusion constituted ''[[novus actus interveniens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |year= 1975 |court=EWCA | division=Crim |num=3 |litigants=R v Blaue |parallelcite=[1975] 1 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 1411 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine is applied in all areas of torts – [[intentional torts]], [[negligence]], and [[strict liability]] cases – as well as in criminal law. There is no requirement of physical contact with the victim – if a [[trespasser]]'s wrongful presence on the victim's property so terrifies the victim that he has a fatal [[heart attack]], the trespasser will be liable for the damages stemming from his original tort. The foundation for this rule is based primarily on policy grounds. The courts do not want the defendant or accused to rely on the victim's own vulnerability to avoid liability.

The thin skull rule is not to be confused with the related [[crumbling skull rule]] in which the plaintiff suffers from a detrimental position (from a prior injury, for instance) pre-existent to the occurrence of the present tort.  In the "crumbling skull" rule, the prior condition is only to be considered with respect to distinguishing it from any new injury arising from the present tort – as a means of apportioning damages in such a way that the defendant would not be liable for placing the plaintiff in a better position than they were in prior to the present tort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Athey v Leonati |year=1996 |court=SCC |num=83 |format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1996] 3 S.C.R. 458, (1996), 140 D.L.R. (4th) 235 |date= |courtname=auto |juris=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
In an example, a person who has [[Osteogenesis Imperfecta]] (OI; also known as "Brittle Bone Syndrome") is more likely to be injured in a motor vehicle accident.  If the person with OI is hit from behind in a motor vehicle collision and suffers medical damages (such as [[clavicle]] fracture), it would not be a prudent defense to state that the Osteogenesis Imperfecta was the cause of the fracture.

==Case illustrations==
(UK) In the case of ''[[Smith v Leech Brain &amp; Co]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Smith v Leech Brain &amp; Co]]'' [1962] 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 405.&lt;/ref&gt; an employee in a factory was splashed with molten metal. The metal burned him on his lip, which happened to be [[premalignant]] tissue. He died three years later from cancer triggered by the injury.  The judge held that as long as the initial injury was foreseeable, the defendant was liable for all the harm.

(US) In 1891, the [[State supreme court|Wisconsin Supreme Court]] came to a similar result in ''[[Vosburg v. Putney]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vosburg v. Putney]]'' 80 Wis. 523, 50 N.W. 403 (Wis., 1891) ([[Reversal (law)|reversed]] and [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]]ed for a new trial on other grounds).&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, a boy threw a small kick at another from across the aisle in the classroom. It turned out that the victim had an unknown microbial condition that was irritated, and resulted in him entirely losing the use of his leg. No one could have predicted the level of injury. Nevertheless, the court found that the kicking was [[Law|unlawful]] because it violated the "order and decorum of the classroom", and the perpetrator was therefore fully liable for the injury.

(US) In ''[[Benn v. Thomas]]'', the appellate court determined that the eggshell rule should have been applied to a case in which a man had a heart attack and died after being bruised in the chest during a rear-end car accident.&lt;ref&gt;
512 N.W.2d 537 ( Iowa, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

(Aus) In the case of ''Nader v Urban Transit Authority of NSW'',&lt;ref name="Nader"/&gt; the plaintiff was a 10 year old boy who struck his head on a bus stop pole while alighting from a slowly moving bus. He developed a rare psychological condition known as [[Ganser Syndrome]]. The defendant argued that the illness resulted from his family’s response to the accident. McHugh JA said (at 537), "The defendant must take the plaintiff with all his weaknesses, beliefs and reactions as well as his capacities and attributes, physical, social and economic. If the result of an accident is that a ten year old boy reacts to his parents’ concern over his injuries and develops an hysterical condition, no reason of justice, morality or entrenched principle appears to me to prevent his recovery of compensation."

(Aus) In the case of ''[[Kavanagh v Akhtar]]'',&lt;ref name="Kavanagh v Akhtar"/&gt; the court held the tortfeasor should take into account the plaintiff's family and cultural setting. Equality before the law puts a heavy onus on the person who would argue that the "unusual" reaction of an injured plaintiff should be disregarded because a minority religious or cultural situation may not have been foreseeable.

==Exceptions==
[[causation (law)#Intervening cause|Intervening cause]] is typically an exception to the eggshell skull rule.  If an injury is not immediate, but a separate situation agitates the injury (such as the injured party being involved in a vehicular collision while being taken to a hospital), the tortfeasor is not liable under common law in Australia (see ''Haber v Walker'',&lt;ref name="Haber v Walker"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|51|1963|litigants=Haber v Walker |parallelcite=[1963] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 339 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Mahoney v Kruschich Demolitions''&lt;ref name="Mahoney v Kruschich"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|37|1985|litigants=Mahony v J Kruschich (Demolitions) Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1985) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 522 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). In ''Haber v Walker'' it was held that a plaintiff will not be liable for a novus actus interveniens (intervening act) if the chain of causation was broken by a voluntary, human act or, an independent event, which in conjunction with the wrongful act, was so unlikely as to be termed a coincidence.&lt;ref name="Haber v Walker"/&gt; In ''Mahoney v Kruschich Demolitions'' the plaintiff, Glogovic, was injured while working on the demolition of a power house for the respondent. While being treated for his injuries, his injuries were exacerbated by the negligent medical treatment of the appellant, Mahony. It was held that there was no novus actus as a result of medical treatment of injuries caused by the defendant’s negligence, unless such treatment is inexcusably bad or completely outside the bounds of what a reputable medical practitioner might prescribe.&lt;ref name="Mahoney v Kruschich"/&gt;

'''Elena Tejada-Herrera''' is a trans-disciplinary artist that was born in Peru and became known for her work in performance and [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] arts. Her work promotes the participation of the public.

== Performance ==
Elena Tejada-Herrera studied [[painting]] but attained public attention in a controversial way. She became known within the [[Peruvian art]] scene at the end of the 90’s thanks to her performance and multimedia works related to the Peruvian socio economical context, marginal urban cultural expressions and popular culture. Since then she has proposed diverse reflections about the female body and gender constructions with her works. Her works are disinhibited, unapologetic, and scape the normative criteria that characterizes Peruvian [[contemporary art]] in general. During the last 15 years her works have generated situations that promote public participation and the realization of collective aesthetic experiences.

== Work ==
Elena Tejada-Herrera became known as a painter, but got great attention because of her performance art work.
In 1999 Tejada-Herrera presented her video [[performance]] Bomba and the Bataclana in the Belly Dance in which the artist appeared as a cabaret dancer along with street sellers that she hired to perform with her. This piece dealt with the body, [[Gender studies|gender]] constructions, and incorporated the participation of the public. The artist was awarded the first prize in the art contest Passport for an Artist for this artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hernandez Calvo, Villacorta|first1=Max, Jorge|title=Franquicias imaginarias. Las opciones estéticas en las artes plásticas en el Perú de fin de siglo: artes, ciencias y humanidades: cuestiones y perspectivas.|date=2002|publisher=Fondo Editorial Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú|location=Lima|pages=178|edition=1st|url=http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=15132890149&amp;searchurl=isbn%3D9789972424625%26sortby%3D20|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002 to 2006 while living in Virginia Tejada-Herrera focused each time more on pieces that incorporated the participation of the public like the series Paper Animals, Holding the House Together, One Day Around The Neighborhood Choreographing My Dance. For this piece Tejada-Herrera asked strangers on stores, and in her neighborhood to teach her how to dance and to choreograph her. Simultaneously she carried on landscape interventions on highways that addressed the drivers as her audience. Other pieces were performances interventions in malls and different public spaces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buil, B.|title=Elena Tejada-Herrera:Sharing Territories to communicate understanding|journal=Art Voices|date=2008|issue=10|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Tejada-Herrera was selected to represent Peru at the Nipon International Performance Festival (NIPAF). Her participation consisted of a long distance telephone performance. For this event Tejada-Herrera called random numbers from the telephone books from the cities of Tokyo, and Nagoya. Her conversations with strangers related to the situation of women immigrants in [[Japan]]. Tejada-Herrera continued with these long distance telephone performances with [[Canada]], and with Peru. In Peru she presented an installation that included a phone from which the audience could hear her long distance recorded conversations with her mother.

The same year she participated as a feature artist at PerformIt in [[Tucson]] [[Arizona]], organized by the Plugged Art Collective. Her participation included the performances The Teasing Monkey, Gallery Security, What Would It Take to leave Every Thing Behind, Acts of Love, Grooming Me, and Always Up.
Also in 2007 Elena was awarded the Grand Prix for her performances at the Parnu Performance Festival, in [[Estonia]].

In 2008 Tejada-Herrera presented the exhibition "About You" at Dean Project Gallery in Long Island City [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. This exhibition started with street performances for which Tejada-Herrera invited passers by to participate. The performances included conversations, video portraits, and ephemeral performances made with the body among others. The passers by and witnesses were invited to the gallery to write their experiences and about their days. The exhibition opened with a video projection of the performance of the day and the first writings by the public on the gallery walls. Little by little the walls were filled with texts. On a Sunday Tejada-Herrera invited the public outside the gallery to enter and to paint on the walls. This was their day, in which the passers by painted and exhibited their creations within Tejada-Herrera's exhibition. At the closing reception, more video documentation of the performances made by Tejada-Herrera with the public and photographs were added. These were displayed in between the texts and paintings made by the public.

In 2009 Tejada-Herrera traveled to [[Lima]], [[Peru]] where she was invited to create an artwork at the Peruvian National Library. Elena Tejada-Herrera was granted permission to create artworks with the librarians during their working hours. Tejada-Herrera invited the librarians to bring their hobbies to their offices, and to participate within video art pieces. Tejada-Herrera also brought an approach with which she was working for many years since her first stay in Virginia, USA. This approach consisted of working within people's homes, like in the piece Paper Animals, and One Day at the Neighborhood Choreographing My Dance. The piece created within this process was Art Delivery realized with the librarian Nelly Bobbio. The resulting artwork is a video art piece with the librarian's voice over. This voice over explained the detail of her practice as a librarian while in the video she is performing a sculpture using her body and the furniture in her house. This piece features what Tejada-Herrera calls cultural exchanges, approach in which Tejada-Herrera explains her art practice to the participant who then she invites to interpret from his/her own perspective using the materials at hand. In this case the materials were the domestic furniture. The exhibition presented several video screens placed on top of wooden library furniture. There were huge amounts of shredded paper coming out of the furniture drawers on to the floor, covering big areas. The videos displayed the librarians executing their hobbies and expressing their opinions. There were librarians acting in front of the camera, singing solo and in group. There were librarians singing a serenata for a sanitation worker at the library. Another librarian sang karaoke in front of his co-workers. In a video piece a librarian was working while shredded paper covered him and his whole office. A librarian performed his normal regular duties as a librarian on a desk inside the gallery while he listened at his favorite music and Tejada-Herrera served him coffee and his favorite snacks.

Back in the United States Tejada-Herrera presented several art installations made in collaboration with office workers that facilitated the shredded paper that they collected for 15 days. These installations were presented at Miami International University. One of these pieces consisted of giant plastic bags filled with huge amounts of shredded paper. the other installation was a shelf from which colorful shredded paper fell like a waterfall on the floor. The installation ended with a participative performance with the workers.

In 2010 Tejada-Herrera participated in a residency at [[Atlantic Center for the Arts]]. Within this Tejada-Herrera created several photo and video series. 
In 2010 Tejada-Herrera traveled to [[Huancayo]] in Peru where she co-led a workshop along with the architect Alberto Tejada Herrera. The workshop was part of the CONEA, (Congreso Nacional de Estudiantes de Arquitectura) (National Peruvian Congress of Architectural Students). in this workshop the students created architectural installations on public parks in the area. These were a playground and a bus stop.

The following years Tejada-Herrera realized several video art works with the subject of the male body and sexuality from a woman's point of view. Her works included a homage to the artist Giuseppe Campuzano.

Since 2011 Tejada-Herrera returned to some object based art making, creating room sized installations and [[conceptual art|conceptual]] [[landscape]] interventions in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], including [[Chicago]] and [[Prague]].

In 2015 Tejada-Herrera presented an exhibition as part of 2nd Floor Rear, in which she invited the public to create [[costumes]], [[sculptures]], and [[art installations]] using the lines that she previously made with objects for the room sized installation Lengths of Consumption. The piece called "Playtime is About You" started with video projections of [[Zumba]] tutorials. After warming up the public was invited to play and create the collective installation.

Also in 2015 Elena Tejada-Herrera participated at the Chicago Home Theater Festival. The hosts for her site specific project were the artist [[Faheem Majeed]] and his wife [[LaShana Jackson]].  
Just as in former projects, Tejada-Herrera invited her hosts to participate within the artwork. The video piece was presented on the 16th of May at Majeed's and Jackson's home along with the artworks of other local artists from Chicago.

Tejada-Herrera has a continuous presence within the art scene in Chicago, other cities in the United States and Internationally. Her production is a [[:wikt:hybrid|hybrid]] that blends conceptual approaches, [[new media]], and participative art practices.

An '''emergent organization''' (alternatively '''emergent organisation''') is an [[organization]] that spontaneously [[emergence|emerges]] from and exists in a complex dynamic [[natural environment|environment]] or [[market place]], rather than being a construct or copy of something that already exists. The term first appeared in the late 1990s and was the topic of the Seventh Annual Washington [[Evolutionary Systems]] Conference at [[University of Ghent]], [[Belgium]] in May, 1999. Emergent organizations and their dynamics pose interesting questions; for example, how does such an organization achieve closure and stability?

Alternatively, [[James R. Taylor]] wrote in 2000 his seminal book, ''The Emergent Organization'', where he suggests that all organizations emerge from communication, especially from the interplay of conversation and text. This idea concerns human organizations, but is consistent with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] or [[Gabriel Tarde]]'s [[monadology]], or with [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s [[process philosophy]], which explains the macro—both in human and non-human "societies"—from the processes taking place between its constituent parts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11254">'''Emotional blackmail''' and '''FOG''' are terms, popularized by [[psychotherapist]] Susan Forward, about controlling people in relationships and the theory that [[fear]], [[obligation]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] (FOG) are the [[transactional analysis|transactional dynamics]] at play between the controller and the person being controlled. Understanding these dynamics is useful to anyone trying to extricate from the [[controlling behavior]] of another person, and deal with their own compulsions to do things that are uncomfortable, undesirable, burdensome, or self-sacrificing for others.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=R. Skip |title=Emotional Blackmail: Fear, Obligation and Guilt (FOG) |url=http://bpdfamily.com/content/emotional-blackmail-fear-obligation-and-guilt-fog |publisher=[[BPDFamily.com]] |date=16 August 2014 |access-date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General ==
The first documented use of "emotional blackmail" appeared in 1947 in the ''Journal of the National Association of Deans of Women'' in the article "Emotional Blackmail Climate". The term was used to describe one type of problematic classroom control model often used by teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unknown|journal=Journal of the National Association of Deans of Women|date=1947|volume= 11-12|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Esther Vilar]], an Argentine physician, also used the term "emotional blackmail" in the early 1970s to describe a parenting strategy observed among some mothers with multiple children.&lt;ref&gt;"To  instill  obedience  into  an  only  child,  the  mother  has  to  evolve  complex  methods  to  outsmart and persuade it, and get it to see reason; or it has to be punished. Since this is a nuisance, mother usually 
leaves it to father. Several children, on the other hand, can be trained by emotional blackmail. As they are all dependent on their mother's approval, she has only to show a slight preference for one and the others will do anything she tells them to. Every child lives in constant fear that its mother will 'withdraw' her love and give it to some
one else." Villar, Esther (1972). The Manipulated Man, Bantam/Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Inc. &lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional blackmail typically involves two people who have established a close personal or intimate relationship (parent and child, spouses, siblings, or two close friends).&lt;ref&gt;Stanlee Phelps/Nancy Austin, ''The Assertive Woman'' (1987) p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Children, too, will employ [[special pleading]] and emotional blackmail to promote their own interests, and self-development, within the family system.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Rapport ed., ''British Subjects'' (Oxford 2002) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional blackmailers use fear, obligation and guilt in their relationships, ensuring that others feel afraid to cross them, obligated to give them their way and swamped by guilt if they resist. Knowing that someone close to them wants love, approval or confirmation of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[self-esteem]], blackmailers may threaten to withhold them (e.g., withhold love) or take them away altogether, making the second person feel they must earn them by agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Miller, ''R. D. Laing'' (2004) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Fear, obligation or guilt is commonly referred to as "FOG". FOG is a contrived acronym—a play on the word "fog" which describes something that obscures and confuses a situation or someone's thought processes.

The person who is acting in a controlling way often wants something from the other person that is legitimate to want. They may want to feel loved, safe, valuable, appreciated, supported, needed, etc. This is not the problem. The problem is often more a matter of how they are going about getting what they want, or that they are insensitive to others' needs in doing so that is troubling—and how others react to all of this.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"/&gt;

Under pressure, one may become a sort of hostage, forced to act under pressure of the threat of responsibility for the other's [[Mental breakdown|breakdown]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Baudrillard]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=lKvjtv31AqoC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174 ''The Revenge of the Crystal''] (1999) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; and could fall into a pattern of letting the blackmailer control his/her decisions and behavior, lost in what [[Doris Lessing]] described as "a sort of psychological fog".&lt;ref&gt;Doris Lessing, ''The Golden Notebook'' (1973) p. 554&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Forward and Frazier identify four blackmail types each with their own [[mental manipulation]] style:&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;Susan Forward/Donna Frazier, ''Emotional Blackmail'' (London 1997) p. 28, 82, 145, 169&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different levels of demands—demands that are of little consequence, demands that involve important issues or personal [[integrity]], demands that affect major life decisions, and/or demands that are dangerous or illegal.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"/&gt;

== Patterns and characteristics ==

===Addictions===
Addicts often believe that being in control is how to achieve success and happiness in life. People who follow this rule use it as a survival skill, having usually learned it in childhood. As long as they make the rules, no one can back them into a corner with their feelings.&lt;ref name="Fenley"&gt;Fenley, Jr., James L. ''Finding a Purpose in the Pain'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental illness===
People with certain mental conditions are predisposed to controlling behavior including those with [[paranoid personality disorder]],&lt;ref name="Goldberg"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Goldberg, MD|first=Joseph|title=Paranoid Personality Disorder |url=http://webmd.com/mental-health/paranoid-personality-disorder|date=23 May 2014|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[borderline personality disorder]],&lt;ref name="braiker"&gt;Braiker, Harriet B., ''Who's Pulling Your Strings? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[narcissistic personality disorder]].&lt;ref name= 'Nina W. Brown'&gt;Nina W. Brown, ''Children of the Self-Absorbed'' (2008) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

People with borderline personality disorder are particularly likely to use emotional blackmail&lt;ref name="braiker"/&gt; (as too are destructive [[Narcissism|narcissists]]).&lt;ref name="Nina W. Brown"/&gt; However, their actions may be impulsive and driven by fear and a desperate sense of hopelessness, rather than being the product of any conscious plan.&lt;ref&gt;Blaise A. Aguirre, ''Borderline Personality Disorder in Adolescents'' (2007) p. 73-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Codependency===
[[Codependency]] often involves placing a lower priority on one's own needs, while being excessively preoccupied with the needs of others. Codependency can occur in any type of relationship, including family, work, friendship, and also romantic, peer or community relationships.&lt;ref name="CODA"&gt;[http://www.coda.org/tools4recovery/Patterns2-2011.htm Codependents Anonymous: Patterns and Characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824075736/http://www.coda.org/tools4recovery/Patterns2-2011.htm |date=2013-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affluenza and children===
[[Affluenza]]—the status insecurity derived from obsessively [[keeping up with the Joneses]]—has been linked by [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] to a pattern of childhood training whereby sufferers were "subjected to a form of emotional blackmail as toddlers. Their mothers' love becomes conditional on exhibiting behaviour that achieved parental goals."&lt;ref&gt;Oliver James, ''Britain on the Couch'' (London 1998) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Assertiveness training'' ===
[[Assertiveness]] training encourages people to not engage in fruitless back-and-forths or power struggles with the emotional blackmailer but instead to repeat a neutral statement, such as "I can see how you feel that way," or, if pressured to eat, say "No thank you, I'm not hungry." They are taught to keep their statements within certain boundaries in order not to capitulate to coercive [[nagging]], emotional blackmail, or [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;Sue Bishop, Develop Your Assertiveness (2006) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery ==
Techniques for resisting emotional blackmail include strengthening [[personal boundaries]], resisting demands, developing a ''power statement''—the determination to stand the pressure—and buying time to break old patterns. Re-connecting with the autonomous parts of the self the blackmailer had over-ruled is not necessarily easy.&lt;ref name="Forward"/&gt; One may feel guilty based on emotional blackmail, even while recognizing the guilt as induced and irrational;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Barnes and Joseph Berke, ''Mary Barnes'' (1974) p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; but still be able to resist overcompensating, and ignore the blackmailer's attempt to gain attention by way of having a [[tantrum]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rogers, ''On Becoming a Person'' (1961) p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistently ignoring the manipulation in a friendly way may however lead to its intensification, and threats of separation,&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (London 1993) p. 349 and p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; or to accusations of being "crazy" or a "home wrecker".&lt;ref name="Forward"/&gt;

== Cultural examples ==

*[[Angela Carter]] described ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' as glorifying emotional blackmail on the part of the Beast, as a means of controlling his target, Beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Aiden Day, ''Angela Carter: The Rational Glass'' (1998) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;
*Novelist [[Doris Lessing]] claimed that “I became an expert in emotional blackmail by the time I was five."&lt;ref&gt;Gayle, Green, ''Doris Lessing: The Poetics of Change'' (1997) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

[[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]] objects that in [[popular psychology]] the idea of emotional blackmail has been misused as a defense against any form of fellow-feeling or consideration for others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=yxkrED7hVuIC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41 ''The Comfort of Things''] (2008) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeling of this dynamic with inflammatory terms such as "blackmail" and "manipulation" may not be so helpful as it is both polarizing and it implies premeditation and malicious intent which is often not the case. Controlling behavior and being controlled is a transaction between two people with both playing a part.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"/&gt;

The '''empty lattice approximation''' is a theoretical [[electronic band structure]] model in which the potential is ''periodic'' and ''weak'' (close to constant). One may also consider an empty{{clarify|is there actually some lattice that is "empty"?|date=November 2014}} irregular lattice, in which the potential is not even periodic.&lt;ref&gt;Physics  Lecture Notes. P.Dirac, Feynman,R.,1968. Internet, Amazon,25.03.2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The empty lattice approximation describes a number of properties of energy dispersion relations of non-interacting [[Free electron model|free electrons]] that move through a [[crystal structure|crystal lattice]]. The energy of the electrons in the "empty lattice" is the same as the energy of free electrons. The model is useful because it clearly illustrates a number of the sometimes very complex features of energy dispersion relations in solids which are fundamental to all electronic band structures.
__TOC__

==Scattering and periodicity==
[[Image:1D-Empty-Lattice-Approximation.svg|thumb|400px|Free electron bands in a one dimensional lattice]]
The periodic potential of the lattice in this free electron model must be weak because otherwise the electrons wouldn't be free. The strength of the scattering mainly depends on the geometry and topology of the system. Topologically defined parameters, like [[Scattering cross-section|scattering]] [[Cross section (physics)|cross sections]], depend on the magnitude of the potential and the size of the [[potential well]]. For 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional spaces potential wells do always scatter waves, no matter how small their potentials are, what their signs are or how limited their sizes are. For a particle in a one-dimensional lattice, like the [[Kronig-Penney model]], it is possible to calculate the band structure analytically by substituting the values for the potential, the lattice spacing and the size of potential well.&lt;ref name=Kittel&gt;
{{cite book |author=C. Kittel |title=Introduction to Solid State Physics |year= 1953–1976 |publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-49024-1 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; For two and three-dimensional problems it is more difficult to calculate a band structure based on a similar model with a few parameters accurately. Nevertheless, the properties of the band structure can easily be approximated in most regions by [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation methods]].

In theory the lattice is infinitely large, so a weak periodic scattering potential will eventually be strong enough to reflect the wave. The scattering process results in the well known [[Bragg's law|Bragg reflections]] of electrons by the periodic potential of the [[crystal structure]]. This is the origin of the periodicity of the dispersion relation and the division of [[Reciprocal lattice|k-space]] in Brillouin zones. The periodic energy dispersion relation is expressed
as:
:&lt;math&gt;E_n(\mathbf{k}) = \frac{\hbar^2 (\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{G}_n)^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}_n&lt;/math&gt; are the [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors to which the bands{{clarify|date=November 2014}} &lt;math&gt;E_n(\mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt; belong.

The figure on the right shows the dispersion relation for three periods in reciprocal space of a one-dimensional lattice with lattice cells of length ''a''.
{{clear}}

==The energy bands and the density of states==
In a one-dimensional lattice the number of reciprocal lattice vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}_n&lt;/math&gt; that determine the bands in an energy interval is limited to two when the energy rises. In two and three dimensional lattices the number of reciprocal lattice vectors that determine the free electron bands &lt;math&gt;E_n(\mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt; increases more rapidly when the length of the wave vector increases and the energy rises. This is because the number of reciprocal lattice vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}_n&lt;/math&gt; that lie in an interval &lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k} + d\mathbf{k}]&lt;/math&gt; increases. The [[density of states]] in an energy interval &lt;math&gt;[E,E + dE]&lt;/math&gt; depends on the number of states in an interval  &lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k} + d\mathbf{k}]&lt;/math&gt; in reciprocal space and the slope of the dispersion relation &lt;math&gt;E_n(\mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Free-electron DOS.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 3: Free-electron DOS in 3-dimensional k-space]]
Though the lattice cells are not spherically symmetric, the dispersion relation still has spherical symmetry from the point of view of a fixed central point in a reciprocal lattice cell if the dispersion relation is extended outside the central Brillouin zone. The [[density of states#Parabolic dispersion|density of states]] in a three-dimensional lattice will be the same as in the case of the absence of a lattice. For the three-dimensional case the density of states &lt;math&gt;D_3\left(E\right)&lt;/math&gt; is;

:&lt;math&gt;D_3\left(E\right) = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{E-E_0}{c_k^3}} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

In three-dimensional space the Brillouin zone boundaries are planes. The dispersion relations show conics of the free-electron energy dispersion parabolas for all possible reciprocal lattice vectors. This results in a very complicated set intersecting of curves when the dispersion relations are calculated because there is a large number of possible angles between evaluation trajectories, first and higher order Brillouin zone boundaries and dispersion parabola intersection cones.

==Second, third and higher Brillouin zones==
[[Image:Brillouin Zone (1st, FCC).svg|thumb|300px|right|FCC Brillouin zone]]
"Free electrons" that move through the lattice of a solid with wave vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; far outside the first Brillouin zone are still reflected back into the first Brillouin zone. See the [[#External links|external links]] section for sites with examples and figures.

{{clear}}

==The nearly free electron model==
{{main|Nearly free electron model}}
In most [[Metal|simple metals]], like [[aluminium]], the [[screening effect]] strongly reduces the electric field of the ions in the solid. The electrostatic potential is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;V(r) = \frac{Z e}{r} e^{-q r}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z'' is the [[atomic number]], ''e'' is the elementary unit charge, ''r'' is the distance to the nucleus of the embedded ion and ''q'' is a screening parameter that determines the range of the potential. The [[Fourier transform]], &lt;math&gt;U_{\mathbf{G}}&lt;/math&gt;, of the lattice potential, &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;, is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;U_{\mathbf{G}} =  \frac{4 \pi Z e}{q^2 + \mathbf{G}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

When the values of the off-diagonal elements &lt;math&gt;U_{\mathbf{G}}&lt;/math&gt; between the reciprocal lattice vectors in the Hamiltonian almost go to zero. As a result, the magnitude of the band gap &lt;math&gt;2|U_{\mathbf{G}}|&lt;/math&gt; collapses and the empty lattice approximation is obtained.

==The electron bands of common metal crystals==

Apart from a few exotic exceptions, [[metal]]s crystallize in three kinds of crystal structures: the BCC and FCC [[cubic crystal system|cubic crystal structures]] and the [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] close-packed [[close-packing of spheres#fcc and hcp lattices|HCP]] crystal structure.

[[Philippine President]] [[Rodrigo Duterte]] signed '''Executive Order No. 02''', also known as the '''Freedom of Information (FOI) Program''', on 23 July 2016 in [[Davao City]]. The [[executive order|Executive Order]] established the first [[freedom of information|Freedom of Information]] (FOI) Program in the Philippines covering all government offices under the [[Executive departments of the Philippines|Executive Branch]].&lt;ref name="bkk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/1043469/duterte-signs-freedom-of-information-order |title=Duterte signs freedom of information order |publisher=[[Bangkok Post]] |date=24 July 2016 |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philstar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/07/24/1606146/duterte-signs-historic-eo-freedom-information |title=Duterte signs historic EO on Freedom of Information |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author=Romero, A. |date=24 July 2016 |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires all executive departments, agencies, bureaus, and offices to disclose public records, contracts, transactions, and any information requested by a member of the public, except for matters affecting national security and other information that falls under the inventory of exceptions issued by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea.&lt;ref name="bkk"/&gt; The landmark order was signed two days before Duterte delivered his first [[2016 State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the Nation Address]] and just three weeks after he [[Inauguration of Rodrigo Duterte|assumed the presidency]] on June 30, 2016.&lt;ref name="philstar"/&gt;

==Provisions of Executive Order No. 02, s. 2016==
The FOI Executive Order provides for full public disclosure of all government records involving public interest, and upholds the constitutional right of people to information on matters of public concern.&lt;ref name="gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/2016/07/23/executive-order-no-02-s-2016/ |title=Executive Order No. 02, s. 2016 |publisher=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]] |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Order states:
{{quotation|Every Filipino shall have access to information, official records, public records and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development.|E.O. 2 sec. 3}}

The Order defines "information" to include any
{{quotation|records, documents, papers, reports, letters, contracts, minutes and transcripts of official meetings, maps, books, photographs, data, research materials, films, sound and video recording, magnetic or other tapes, electronic data, computer stored data, any other like or similar data or materials recorded, stored or archived in whatever format, whether offline or online, which are made, received, or kept in or under the control and custody of any government office pursuant to law, executive order, and rules and regulations or in connection with the performance or transaction of official business by any government office.|E.O. 2 sec. 1.a}}

The law expansively defines "official records" as "information produced or received by a public officer or employee, or by a government office in an official capacity or pursuant to a public function or duty," while "public records" refer to "information required by laws, executive orders, rules, or regulations to be entered, kept and made publicly available by a government office."&lt;ref name="gov"/&gt; It also emphasizes the obligation of all public officials to file and make available for scrutiny their [[Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net worth|Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth]] (SALN) in accordance with existing laws, jurispridence, and implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of the Order.&lt;ref name="gov"/&gt;

The Order covers the national government and all its offices, departments, bureaus, and instrumentalities, including [[government-owned and controlled corporation|Government-Owned and/or -Controlled Corporation]]s (GOCCs) and [[Higher education in the Philippines|State Universities and Colleges]] (SUCs). It also encourages all [[local government unit|Local Government Unit]]s (LGUs) to observe and be guided by this Order.&lt;ref name="gov"/&gt;

===Inventory of FOI Exceptions ===
The Order instructs the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and the [[Office of the Solicitor General of the Philippines|Office of the Solicitor General]] (OSG) to prepare and submit an inventory of information that falls under any of the exceptions enshrined in the Constitution, existing laws or jurisprudence, within 30 days. It adds that the inventory of exceptions shall be periodically updated to "properly reflect any change in existing laws and jurisprudence."&lt;ref name="gov"/&gt;

On 22 August 2016, the DOJ and OSG submitted a list of 166 exceptions, 158 of which are "exceptions to FOI" and six (6) more listed as "other exceptions."&lt;ref name="gma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/579250/news/nation/166-exceptions-to-duterte-s-eo-on-foi-up-for-review |title=166 exceptions to Duterte’s EO on FOI up for review |publisher=[[GMA Network]] |author=Alvarez, K.C. |date=28 August 2016 |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draft list includes information that "directly relates to national security and internal or external defense of the state;" matters of foreign affairs which "could affect ongoing bilateral or multilateral negotiations;" law enforcement matters; and proceedings and investigations being conducted by public authorities.&lt;ref name="gma"/&gt;

It also lists as exception information that might endanger a person's life or safety, such as medical records, bank deposits, and other information considered as privileged communication in legal proceedings by law or by the rules of court. [[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)|Presidential Communications Operations Office]] (PCOO) Secretary [[Martin Andanar|Jose Ruperto Martin Andanar]] said the draft list of exceptions would still be reviewed by the Office of the Deputy Executive Secretary for Legal Affairs.&lt;ref name="gma"/&gt;

When the Order took effect on 24 November 2016, the 166 exceptions submitted by the DOJ and OSG were categorized into nine (9) [https://www.foi.gov.ph/downloads/inventory-of-exceptions-to-eo-2.pdf exceptions], as follows:&lt;ref name="bworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Nation&amp;title=eo-on-freedom-of-information-takes-effect-today-palace&amp;id=136876 |title=EO on freedom of information takes effect today: Palace |publisher=[[BusinessWorld]] |author=Cigaral, I.N.P. |date=25 November 2016 |accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://op-proper.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Exceptions-to-Right-of-Access-to-Information.pdf |title=Inventory of Exceptions to Executive Order No. 2 (s. 2016) |publisher=[[Office of the President (Philippines)]] |accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: 1. Information covered by Executive privilege;
: 2. Privileged information relating to national security, defense or international relations;
: 3. Information concerning law enforcement and protection of public and personal safety;
: 4. Information deemed confidential for the protection of the privacy of persons and certain individuals such as minors, victims of crimes, or the accused;
: 5. Information, documents or records known by reason of official capacity and are deemed as confidential, including those submitted or disclosed by entities to government agencies, tribunals, boards, or officers, in relation to the performance of their functions, or to inquiries or investigation conducted by them in the exercise of their administrative, regulatory, or quasi-judicial powers;
: 6. Prejudicial premature disclosure;
: 7. Records of proceedings or information from proceedings which, pursuant to law or relevant rules and regulations, are treated as confidential or privileged;

: 9. Other exceptions to the right to information under laws, jurisprudence, and IRR.

===People's FOI Manual===
The Order directs all government offices under the Executive Branch to prepare and submit their own [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzEJfrC2IqfDenc4NGdzN3VxaVk/view People's FOI Manual] within 120 days upon its effectivity. It shall include:
{{quotation|
:(a) The location and contact information of the head, regional, provincial, and field offices, and other established places where the public can obtain information or submit requests;
:(b) The person or office responsible for receiving requests for information;
:(c) The procedure for the filing and processing of the request as specified in the succeeding section 8 of this Order.
:(d) The standard forms for the submission of requests and for the proper acknowledgment of requests;
:(e) The process for the disposition of requests;
:(f) The procedure for the administrative appeal of any denial for access to information; and
:(g) The schedule of applicable fees.|E.O. 2 sec. 8}}As of August 2018, the following  agencies have submitted their People's FOI Manuals:

* 100% or 190 out of 190 National Government Agencies (NGAs); 
* 85% or 100 out of 118 GOCCs; 
* 90% or 101 out of 112 SUCs; and 
* 34% or 176 out of 521 Local Water Districts (LWDs).

===Process of Requesting Information===
Filipino citizens may access government information either through the [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzEJfrC2IqfDdGFYR04zcUozNDQ/view standard] (paper-based) platform or the [https://www.foi.gov.ph/ Electronic FOI (eFOI) Portal].

The request for access to a government document by any member of the public shall be in writing and must include the name and contact information of the requesting party, a valid proof of his identification, the specific information being requested, and the reason or purpose for the request for information.&lt;ref name="philstar" /&gt; Upon receiving the application, the government official must provide reasonable assistance to the requesting party, and shall respond and notify the applicant of their decision in relation to the request within 15 working days of receiving the request.&lt;ref name="philstar" /&gt; If access has been denied wholly or in part, reasons must be provided to the applicant. The oOder states: "No request for information shall be denied unless it clearly falls under any of the exceptions listed in the inventory or updated inventory of exceptions."&lt;ref name="philstar" /&gt;

The 15 working day response period may be extended to additional 20 working days, in cases where the information being requested requires extensive research or examination of voluminous records. The response period may also be prolonged in the event of unexpected disruption to government services. The government official is then required to notify the applicant of the extension.&lt;ref name="gov" /&gt; Failure to notify the requesting party of the action taken on the request within the response period will be viewed as a denial of the request.&lt;ref name="gov" /&gt;

=== Schedule of Fees ===
Accepting requests for government information is free of charge. However, [https://www.foi.gov.ph/downloads/EO-2-s-2016-signed-copy.pdf Section 10 of the Order] states that government offices may impose reasonable fees to reimburse costs for printing and reproductions of the requested information.

=== Sanctions for Non-Compliance ===
Pursuant to the Order, failure to comply with its provisions may be a ground for administrative and disciplinary sanctions against any erring public officer based on the [http://www.csc.gov.ph/phocadownload/userupload/paio_guevarra/rraccs.pdf Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service].

=== Remedies In Case of Denial ===
A person whose request for access to information has been denied may file an appeal to the Central Appeals and Review Committee of the concerned agency.

Written appeal must be filed by the same person making the request within 15 calendar days from the notice of denial or from the lapse of the period to respond to the request. The appeal shall be decided within 30 working days from the filing of said written appeal. Failure of such person or office to decide within the period shall be deemed a denial of the appeal.

Upon exhaustion of administrative appeal remedies, the requesting party may file the appropriate judicial action in accordance with the Rules of Court.

== The Freedom of Information - Project Management Office ==
Through [https://www.foi.gov.ph/downloads/memorandum-order-no-10s-2017.pdf Memorandum Order No. 10, s. 2016], the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) mandated the PCOO to act as the lead implementing agency for the FOI Program. To operationalize this, the PCOO established the Freedom of Information - Project Management Office (FOI-PMO) through [https://www.foi.gov.ph/downloads/Department_Order_No_18.pdf PCOO Department Order No. 18, s. 2017].

The vision of the FOI-PMO is to regain public trust by revolutionizing how the government discloses information to the citizens and ensuring that government agencies respond to citizen concerns and provide the information they need, all within 15 to 35 working days.

=== Outside the Executive Branch ===
Although the Order only covers agencies under the Executive Branch, LGUs and other government agencies outside the Executive Branch are encouraged to observe and be guided by the Order [https://www.foi.gov.ph/downloads/EO-2-s-2016-signed-copy.pdf Ref].

As of August 2018, the following offices have submitted their FOI Manuals either in paper and/or digital format, and complied with the provisions in the said Order:

# Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) [https://www.ombudsman.gov.ph/docs/FOI/OMB_FOI_Manual.pdf News Art]

=== Localizing the FOI Program ===
Based on a thorough review of the top requested information from government agencies, it has been found that there is a high demand for local, granular information, [http://www.ptvnews.ph/local-govt-units-urged-come-foi-manual/ News Art] such as Internal Revenue Allotments, Regional Development Plans, and information on the Local Government Support Fund. [https://www.foi.gov.ph/requests?status=&amp;search=IRA Ref]

To address this, the PCOO has partnered with the [[Department of the Interior and Local Government]] (DILG) to establish measures to promote the issuance of local FOI Ordinances. The local FOI Ordinance serves as the local counterpart of the Order and sets the standards in providing access to information under the jurisdiction of LGUs. [http://ptvnews.ph/pcoo-dilg-tie-localize-foi-efforts/ News Art]

A PCOO-DILG Joint Memorandum Circular is currently being drafted to further push and support LGUs in the local implementation of the program. [http://ptvnews.ph/pcoo-dilg-tie-localize-foi-efforts/ News Art]

As of August 2018, the following LGUs have already passed their own local FOI Ordinances:

'''Gating''' is a type of punishment similar to a [[Detention (Academia)|detention]] used typically at educational institutions, especially [[boarding schools]]. Precisely what a gating consists of and the rules surrounding it will vary between institutions, but the common element is that someone who has been gated is not permitted to leave the establishment. The word is used as both a noun and a verb.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5861">''''Good citizenship'''' is when one properly fulfills their role as a [[citizen]]. There are many opinions as to what constitutes a good citizen. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] said, "The first requisite of a good citizen in this Republic of ours is that he shall be able and willing to pull his weight."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Roosevelt, Speech at New York (1902-11-11)&lt;/ref&gt; Education is sometimes viewed as a prerequisite to good citizenship, in that it helps citizens make good decisions and deal with [[demagogue]]s who would delude them. Roger Soder writes that in a [[democracy]], where the demands of good citizenship are placed upon all, "only the common schools can provide to all the education that all need."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Good Citizen and the Common School|author=Roger Soder|journal=Phi Delta Kappan Magazine|volume=85|issue=1|date=2003|page=37|jstor=20440499}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science literacy]] is also frequently touted as a key to good citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=S Lee, WM Roth|journal=Science, Technology &amp; Human Values|year=2003|title=Science and the" good citizen": Community-based scientific literacy|url=http://sth.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/28/3/403|doi=10.1177/0162243903028003003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good citizenship is sometimes viewed as requiring both intellectual skills (such as [[critical thinking]]) and participatory skills (such as deliberating civilly, monitoring the government, building coalitions, managing conflict peacefully and fairly, and petitioning, speaking or testifying before public bodies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40027433|title=Educating Democratic Minds in South African Public Schools: African Teachers' Perceptions of Good Citizenship|author=Sonja Schoeman|journal=The Journal of Negro Education|volume=74|issue=3|date=2005|pages=275–286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote that men who serve the state making "no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense...are commonly esteemed good citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Thoreau, Henry David|url=http://thoreau.eserver.org/civil1.html|title=Civil Disobedience}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orit Ichilov notes that children "tend to perceive the government in the image of an ideal father that is benevolent and protective. At this stage, the good citizen is characterized as one who, through his behavior, proves himself one worthy of the love and protection of the government rather than one possessing certain political obligations and rights." Through their early school years, children usually continue to think in apolitical terms of their citizenship, expressing loyalty by their desire to remain in their country due to an attachment to its beauty, wildlife, and good people. By age twelve or thirteen, they begin referring more to political qualities, such as the nature and values of the regime. High school seniors define the good citizen primarily in political terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title="The Good Citizen" As Viewed by Israeli Adolescents|author=Orit Ichilov and Nisan Nave|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=13|issue=3|date=1981|pages=361–376|jstor=421903|doi=10.2307/421903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some students define good citizenship in terms of standing up for what one believes in. [[Joel Westheimer]] identifies the personally responsible citizen (who acts responsibly in his community, e.g. by [[donating blood]]), the participatory citizen (who is an active member of community organizations and/or improvement efforts) and the justice-oriented citizen (who critically assesses social, political, and economic structures to see beyond surface causes) as three different types of "good citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Educating the "Good" Citizen: Political Choices and Pedagogical Goals|author=Joel Westheimer and Joseph Kahne|journal=Political Science and Politics|volume=37|issue=2|year= 2004|pages=241–247|jstor=4488813|doi=10.1017/S1049096504004160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes incentives prevail over desires to be a good citizen. For example, many people will avoid coming forth as witnesses in court cases because they do not want to deal with the inconvenience and [[red tape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why the Good Citizen Avoids Testifying|author=A. S. Cutler|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=287|issue=Judicial Administration and the Common Man|date=1953|pages=103–109|jstor=1028908|doi=10.1177/000271625328700116}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] makes a distinction between the good citizen and the good man, writing, "...there cannot be a single absolute excellence of the good citizen. But the good man is so called in virtue of a single absolute excellence. It is thus clear that it is possible to be a good citizen without possessing the excellence which is the quality of a good man." Specifically, in his view, the good citizen is measured in relation to ruling and being ruled, the good man only in ruling. Some of the ambiguity is likely due to more than one [[Greek word]] being translated "good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Good Man and the Good Citizen in Aristotle's "Politics"|author=Robert Develin|journal=Phronesis|volume=18|issue=1|year=1973|pages=71–79|jstor=4181903|doi=10.1163/156852873X00069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organizations attempt to promote "good citizenship." For example, the [[Boy Scouts of America]] published ''[[Scouting for Boys: A Handbook for Instruction in Good Citizenship]]'', and the [[Ontario Medal for Good Citizenship]] is given to those who are deemed to have made outstanding contributions to the well being of their communities without expectation of remuneration or reward. Another non profit organization, [http://goodcitizen.org Good Citizen], has a mission to teach Americans how to be effective citizens and focuses on 100 citizen actions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2367">'''''Green gifting''''' is an emerging trend that results in a lower [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impact]] as well as a lower impact on personal [[budget]]s from the gift giving process.  It began with the idea of [[recycling]] the packaging around a gift and has expanded into the mindset that presents themselves can be chosen or created for the purpose of recycling or lowering their environmental and budgetary impact.&lt;ref name="Dunmow Waste Management"&gt;[http://www.dunmowwaste.com/blog/green-gifting-101--the-art-of-gift-giving-and-caring-for-mother-nature-15 Dunmow Waste Management], Green Gifting 101: The Art of Gift Giving And Caring For Mother Nature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StarTribune"&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/yourvoices/78416587.html ''Star Tribune''], Twelve Ways of Green Gifting.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James Waste Management"&gt;[http://www.jameswastemanagement.co.uk/news/ James Waste Management], What is upcycling and green gifting?&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[re-gift]]ing has traditionally been frowned upon.&lt;ref name="MoneyCentral"&gt;[http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/Advice/12RulesForRegiftingWithoutFear.aspx Money Central] 12 Rules For 'Regifting' Without Fear&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, one of the most important steps for successful green gifting is for the host to indicate that green gifting is not only approved, but preferred.  An event that features green gifting encourages those invited to practice the level of green gifting the giver is comfortable with:

# [[Re-gift]] a never used or gently used item.&lt;ref name="MoneyCentral" /&gt;
# Use recycled [[wrapping paper]], bows or gift bags.&lt;ref name="StarTribune" /&gt;
# Substitute [[newspaper]] or [[cloth]] for wrapping paper.&lt;ref name="StarTribune" /&gt; Two examples of traditional cloth wrappings are [[furoshiki]] and [[bojagi]].
# Create a present by hand.&lt;ref name="Gypht"&gt;[http://www.gypht.net/green-gifting-six-simple-strategies/], Green Gifting: Six Simple Strategies.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homing''' is the inherent ability of an [[animal]] to [[navigate]] towards an original [[location (geography)|location]] through unfamiliar areas. This location may be either a [[home territory]], or a breeding spot.

==Uses==
Homing abilities can be used to find the way back to home in a [[wikt:migration|migration]]. It is often used in reference to going back to a breeding spot seen years before, as in the case of [[salmon]]. Homing abilities can also be used to go back to familiar territory when displaced over long distances, such as with the [[red-bellied newt]].

==True navigation==
[[Image:Caretta caretta 060417w2.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Loggerhead sea turtle]]s home both using true navigation and magnetic orientation]]
{{see|Animal navigation}}

Some animals use true [[navigation]] for their homing. This means in familiar areas they will use landmarks such as roads, rivers or mountains when flying, or islands and other landmarks while swimming. However, this only works in familiar territory. [[Homing pigeon]]s, for example, will often navigate using familiar [[landmark]]s, such as roads.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3460977.stm BBC News: Pigeons reveal map-reading secret]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sea turtle]]s will also use landmarks to orient themselves.&lt;ref name=Avens&gt;Avens, L., (2003) "Homing Behavior, Navigation, and Orientation of Juvenile Sea Turtles" [https://web.archive.org/web/20090508214743/http://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/PDFdocs/Avens_Dissertation_2003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnetic orientation==
Many animals use [[magnetic]] orientation based on the [[Earth's magnetic field]] to find their way home. This is usually used together with other methods, such as a sun compass, as in [[Bird migration#Orientation and navigation|bird migration]] and in the case of turtles. This is also commonly used when no other methods are available, as in the case of [[lobster]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, K., Pentcheff, N., Nevitt, G., Stetten, G., Zimmer-Faust, R., Jarrard H., and Boles, L., (1995) ''Magnetic orientation of spiny lobsters in the ocean: experiments with undersea coil systems'' The Journal of Experimental Biology '''198'''(10); pg. 2041–2048&lt;/ref&gt; which live underwater, and [[Blesmol|mole rat]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Kimchi, T., and Terkel, J., (2001) ''Magnetic compass orientation in the blind mole rat Spalax ehrenbergi'' The Journal of Experimental Biology '''204'''(4); pg. 751–758&lt;/ref&gt; which home through their underground [[burrow]]s.

==Celestial orientation==
Celestial orientation, navigation using the stars, is commonly used for homing. Displaced [[marbled newt]]s, for example, can only home when stars are visible.&lt;ref&gt;Diego-Rasilla, J., and Luengo, R., (2002) ''Journal of Ethology'' '''20'''(1):137–141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Olfaction==
There is evidence that [[olfaction]], or smell, is used in homing with several salamanders, such as the [[red-bellied newt]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, D., Anderson, O., and Twitty, V. (1968) "Homing Orientation by Olfaction in Newts (Taricha rivularis)" ''Science'' '''160'''(3834):1354–1356&lt;/ref&gt; Olfaction is also necessary for the homing of [[salmon]].&lt;ref&gt;Stabell, O. (1984) "Homing and olfaction in Salmonids: a critical review with special reference to the Atlantic Salmon" ''Biological Reviews'' '''59'''(3):333–388&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topographic memory==
Topographic memory, memory of the contours surrounding the destination, is one common method for navigation. This is mainly used by animals with less intelligence, such as molluscs. [[Limpet]]s use this to find their way back to the home scrape; although whether this is true homing has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Villee, C., and Groody, T., (1940) ''American Midland Naturalist''; '''24'''(1):190–204&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hornbostel–Sachs''' or '''Sachs–Hornbostel''' is a system of [[musical instrument classification]] devised by [[Erich Moritz von Hornbostel]] and [[Curt Sachs]], and first published in the ''Zeitschrift für Ethnologie'' in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Volume 46 (1914) of the ''Zeitschrift'' is available online in a [https://archive.org/details/zeitschriftfre46berluoft variety of formats], as part of the digital [https://archive.org/search.php?query=collection%3A%22toronto%22 collection] of the [[University of Toronto]]. The article by Hornbostel and Sachs is to be found on pages 553–90.&lt;/ref&gt; An English translation was published in the ''[[Galpin Society|Galpin Society Journal]]'' in 1961. It is the most widely used system for classifying [[musical instruments]] by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologists]] and [[organology|organologists]] (people who study musical instruments). The system was updated in 2011 as part of the work of the Musical Instrument Museums Online (MIMO) Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Evénement |url=http://www.mimo-international.com |title=MIMO Project - Musical Instrument Museums Online |publisher=Mimo-international.com |date= |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hornbostel and Sachs based their ideas on a system devised in the late 19th century by [[Victor-Charles Mahillon]], the curator of musical instruments at [[Brussels Conservatory]]. Mahillon divided instruments into four broad categories according to the nature of the sound-producing material: an air column; string; membrane; and body of the instrument. From this basis, Hornbostel and Sachs expanded Mahillon's system to make it possible to classify any instrument from any culture.

Formally, the Hornbostel–Sachs is modeled on the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] for libraries. It has five top-level classifications, with several levels below those, adding up to over 300 basic categories in all. The top five levels of the scheme are as follows:

==Idiophones (1)==
'''[[Idiophone]]s''' primarily produce their sounds by means of the actual body of the instrument vibrating, rather than a string, membrane, or column of air. In essence, this group includes all [[percussion instrument]]s apart from [[drums]], as well as some other instruments. In the Hornbostel–Sachs classification, idiophones are first categorized according to the method used to play the instrument. The result is four main categories: struck idiophones (11), plucked idiophones (12), friction idiophones (13), and blown idiophones (14). These groups are subsequently divided through various criteria. In many cases these sub-categories are split in singular specimens and sets of instruments. The latter category includes the [[xylophone]], the [[marimba]], the [[glockenspiel]], and the [[glass harmonica]].

([[List of idiophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number]])

===[[Struck idiophone]]s (11)===
These idiophones are set in vibration by being struck, for example [[cymbal]]s or [[xylophone]]s.

====[[Directly struck idiophone]]s (111)====
The player himself/herself executes the movement of striking; whether by mechanical intermediate devices, beaters, keyboards, or by pulling ropes, etc. It is definitive that the player can apply clear, exact, individual strokes, and that the instrument itself is equipped for this kind of percussion.
* 111.1 [[Concussion idiophone]]s or [[clapper (musical instrument)|clappers]] – Two or more complementary sonorous parts are struck against each other.
** 111.11 Concussion [[wikt:stick|sticks]] or [[stick clapper]]s ([[clapstick]]).
** 111.12 Concussion [[plaque (instrument)|plaques]] or [[plaque clapper]]s ([[paiban]]).
** 111.13 Concussion [[trough (physics)|troughs]] or [[watering trough|trough]] clappers ([[devil chase]]).
** 111.14 Concussion [[Bowl (vessel)|vessels]] or [[vessel clapper]]s ([[spoon (musical instrument)|spoons]]).
*** 111.141 [[Castanets]] – Natural and hollowed-out vessel clappers.
*** 111.142 [[Cymbals]] – Vessel clappers with manufactured rim.
* 111.2 [[Percussion idiophone]]s – The instrument is struck either with a non-sonorous object (hand, stick, striker) or against a non-sonorous object (human body, the ground).
** 111.21 [[Percussion stick]]s.
*** 111.211 Individual percussion sticks.
*** 111.212 Sets of percussion sticks in a range of different pitches combined into one instrument. – All [[xylophone]]s, as long  as their sounding components are not in two different planes.
** 111.22 [[Percussion plaque]]s.
*** 111.221 Individual percussion plaques.
*** 111.222 Sets of percussion plaques – Examples are the [[lithophone]] and also most [[metallophone]]s.
** 111.23 [[Percussion tube]]s.
*** 111.231 Individual percussion tubes.
*** 111.232 Sets of percussion tubes.
** 111.24 [[Percussion vessel]]s.
*** 111.241 [[Gong]]s – The vibration is strongest near the vertex.
**** 111.241.1 Individual gongs.
**** 111.241.2 Sets of gongs.
*** 111.242 [[Bell]]s – The vibration is weakest near the vertex.
**** 111.242.1 Individual bells.
***** 111.242.11 Resting bells whose opening faces upward (for example the [[singing bowl|standing bell]])
***** 111.242.12 Hanging bells suspended from the apex.
****** 111.242.121 Hanging bells without internal strikers.
****** 111.242.122 Hanging bells with internal strikers.
**** 111.242.2 Sets of bells or [[chimes]].
***** 111.242.21 Sets of resting bells whose opening faces upward.
***** 111.242.22 Sets of hanging bells suspended from the apex.
****** 111.242.221 Sets of hanging bells without internal strikers.
****** 111.242.222 Sets of hanging bells with internal strikers.

====Indirectly struck idiophones (112)====
The player himself/herself does not go through the movement of striking; percussion results indirectly through some other movement by the player.
* 112.1 Shaken Idiophones or [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]] – The player makes a shaking motion
** 112.11 Suspension rattles – Perforated idiophones are mounted together, and shaken to strike against each other.
*** 112.111 Strung rattles – Rattling objects are strung in rows on a cord.
*** 112.112 Stick rattles – Rattling objects are strung on a bar or ring.
** 112.12 Frame rattles – Rattling objects are attached to a carrier against which they strike ([[flexatone]]).
*** 112.121 Pendant rattles.
*** 112.122 Sliding rattles.
** 112.13 Vessel rattles – Rattling objects enclosed in a vessel strike against each other or against the walls of the vessel, or usually against both.
* 112.2 Scraped Idiophones – The player causes a scraping movement directly or indirectly; a non-sonorous object moves along the notched surface of a sonorous object, to be alternately lifted off the teeth and flicked against them; or an elastic sonorous object moves along the surface of a notched non-sonorous object to cause a series of impacts. This group must not be confused with that of friction idiophones.
** 112.21 Scraped sticks.
*** 112.211 Scraped sticks without resonator.
*** 112.212 Scraped sticks with resonator.
** 112.22 Scraped tubes.
** 112.23 Scraped vessels.
** 112.24 Scraped wheels – cog rattles or [[Ratchet (instrument)|Ratchet]]
* 112.3 Split idiophones – Instruments in the shape of two springy arms connected at one end and touching at the other: the arms are forced apart by a little stick, to jangle or vibrate on recoil.

===[[Plucked idiophone]]s (12)===
{{See|List of lamellophones}}

Plucked idiophones, or [[lamellaphone]]s, are idiophones set in vibration by being plucked; examples include the [[jaw harp]] or [[mbira]]. This group is sub-divided in the following two categories:

====In the form of a frame (121)====
The lamellae vibrate within a frame or hoop.
* 121.1 Clack idiophones or [[Cricri]] – The lamella is carved in the surface of a fruit shell, which serves as resonator.
* 121.2 Guimbardes  and [[Jaw harp]]s – The lamella is mounted in a rod- or plaque-shaped frame and depends on the player's mouth cavity for resonance.
** 121.21 Idioglot guimbardes – The lamella is cut through the frame of the instrument ([[kubing]]).
** 121.22 Heteroglot guimbardes – The lamella is attached to the frame (Western Jew's harp, [[kouxian]]).
*** 121.221 Individual heteroglot guimbardes.
*** 121.222 Sets of heteroglot guimbardes

====In the form of a comb (122)====
The lamellae are tied to a board or cut out from a board like the teeth of a comb.
* 122.1 With laced on lamellae.
** 122.11 Without resonator.
** 122.12 With resonator.
* 122.2 With cut-out lamellae – [[Musical box]]

===[[Friction idiophone]]s (13)===
Idiophones which are rubbed, for example the [[nail violin]], a bowed instrument with solid pieces of metal or wood rather than strings.

====Friction sticks (131)====
* 131.1 Individual friction sticks.
* 131.2 Sets of friction sticks.
** 131.21 Without direct friction.
** 131.22 With direct friction.

====Friction plaques (132)====
* 132.1 Individual friction plaques.
* 132.2 Sets of friction plaques.

====Friction vessels (133)====
* 133.1 Individual friction vessels (for example the [[singing bowl]])
* 133.2 Sets of friction vessels.

===[[Blown idiophone]]s (14)===
Blown idiophones are idiophones set in vibration by the movement of air, for example the [[Aeolsklavier]], an instrument consisting of several pieces of wood which vibrate when air is blown onto them by a set of [[bellows]]. The [[piano chanteur]] features plaques.

====Blown sticks (141)====
* 141.1 Individual blown sticks.
* 141.2 Sets of blown sticks.
** [[Aeolodion]]

====Blown plaques (142)====
* 142.1 Individual blown plaques.
* 142.2 Sets of blown plaques.

===Unclassified idiophones (15)===

==Membranophones (2)==
'''[[Membranophone]]s''' primarily produce their sounds by means of the vibration of a tightly stretched membrane. This group includes all [[drum]]s and [[kazoo]]s. [[List of membranophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number]]

===Struck membranophones (21)===
Struck drums are instruments which have a struck membrane. This includes most types of drums, such as the [[timpani]], or [[kettle drum]], and the [[snare drum]].

*** 211.322 Instruments which have two usable membranes

====Shaken membranophones (212)====
Instruments which are shaken, the membrane being vibrated by objects inside the drum ([[rattle drum]]s).

===Plucked membranophones (22)===
Instruments with a string attached to the membrane, so that when the string is plucked, the membrane vibrates ([[plucked drum]]s).&lt;br&gt;
Some commentators believe that instruments in this class ought instead to be regarded as chordophones (see below).

===Friction membranophones (23)===
Instruments in which the membrane vibrates as a result of friction. These are drums which are rubbed, rather than being struck.

[[List of chordophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number]]

===Simple chordophones or [[zither]]s (31)===
Instruments which are in essence simply a string or strings and a string bearer. These instruments may have a resonator box, but removing it should not render the instrument unplayable, though it may result in quite a different sound being produced.

===Unclassified chordophones (33)===

==Aerophones (4)==
'''[[Aerophone]]s''' primarily produce their sounds by means of vibrating air. The instrument itself does not vibrate, and there are no vibrating strings or membranes. [[List of aerophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number]]

===Free aerophones (41)===
Instruments in which the vibrating air is not contained within the instrument, for example sirens,&lt;!--Is this correct? Is [[Car horn#Signalling and vehicle horns]] what is meant?--&gt; or the [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarer]].

====Displacement free aerophones (411)====
The air-stream meets a sharp edge, or a sharp edge is moved through the air. In either case, according to more recent views, a periodic displacement of air occurs to the alternate flanks of the edge. Examples are the swordblade or the whip.

====Interruptive free aerophones (412)====
The air-stream is interrupted periodically.
* 412.1 Idiophonic interruptive aerophones or reeds – The air-stream is directed against a lamella, setting it in periodic vibration to interrupt the stream intermittently. In this group also belong reeds with a 'cover,' i.e. a tube in which the air vibrates only in a secondary sense, not producing the sound but simply adding roundness and timbre to the sound made by the reed's vibration; generally recognizable by the absence of fingerholes.
** 412.11 Concussion reeds – Two lamellae make a gap which closes periodically during their vibration.
** 412.12 Percussion reeds – A single lamella strikes against a frame.
*** 412.121 Independent percussion reeds.
*** 412.122 Sets of percussion reeds. – Earlier organs
** 412.13 [[Free-reed instrument]]s feature a reed which vibrates within a closely fitting slot (there may be an attached pipe, but it should only vibrate in sympathy with the reed, and not have an effect on the pitch – instruments of this class can be distinguished from 422.3 by the lack of finger-holes).
*** 412.131 Individual free reeds.
*** 412.132 Sets of free reeds – [[Accordion]], [[harmonica]], and [[reed pipe]]s of the [[pipe organ]].
** 412.14 Band reed instruments – The air hits the sharp edge of a band under tension. The acoustics of this instrument have so far not been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mimo-db.eu/HornbostelAndSachs/237 412.14 Ribbon reeds]," ''Mimo-db.eu.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* 412.2 Non-idiophonic interruptive instruments. The interruptive agent is not a reed.
** 412.21 Rotating aerophones (interruptive agent rotates in its own plane and does not turn on its axis)- [[Siren disk]].
** 412.22 Whirling aerophones (interruptive agent turns on its axis) – [[Bullroarer]], [[whirly tube]].

====Plosive aerophones (413)====

===Non-free aerophones (wind instruments proper) (42)===
The vibrating air is contained within the instrument. This group includes most of the instruments called [[wind instrument]]s in the west, such as the [[flute]] or [[French horn]], as well as many other kinds of instruments such as [[conch shell]]s.

====[[Edge-blown aerophones|Edge-blown aerophones or flutes]] (421)====

===Unclassified aerophones (43)===
{{Empty section|date=November 2018|section= }}

==[[Electrophone]]s (5)==
* 51. Instruments having electric action (e.g. pipe organ with electrically controlled solenoid air valves);
* 52. Instruments having electrical amplification, such as the Neo-Bechstein piano of 1931, which had 18 microphones built into it;
* 53. ''Radioelectric instruments'': instruments in which sound is produced by electrical means.

The fifth top-level group, the '''[[electrophone]]s''' category, was added by Sachs in 1940, to describe instruments involving electricity. Sachs broke down his 5th category into 3 subcategories: 51=electrically actuated acoustic instruments; 52=electrically amplified acoustic instruments; 53= instruments which make sound primarily by way of electrically driven oscillators, such as [[theremin]]s or [[synthesizer]]s, which he called radioelectric instruments. [[Francis William Galpin]] provided such a group in his own classification system, which is closer to Mahillon than Sachs–Hornbostel. For example, in Galpin's 1937 book ''A Textbook of European Musical Instruments,'' he lists electrophones with three second-level divisions for sound generation ("by oscillation," "electro-magnetic," and "electro-static"), as well as third-level and fourth-level categories based on the control method. Sachs himself proposed subcategories 51, 52, and 53, on pages 447–467 of his 1940 book ''The History of Musical Instruments.'' However, the original 1914 version of the system did not acknowledge the existence of his 5th category.

Present-day ethnomusicologists, such as Margaret Kartomi (page 173) and Ellingson (PhD dissertation, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;544), suggest that, in keeping with the spirit of the original Hornbostel–Sachs classification scheme, of categorization by what first produces the initial sound in the instrument, that only subcategory 53 should remain in the electrophones category. Thus it has been more recently proposed that, for example, the pipe organ (even if it uses electric key action to control solenoid valves) remain in the aerophones category, and that the electric guitar remain in the chordophones category, etc..

==Application of the system==
Beyond the top three groups are several further levels of classification, so that the [[xylophone]], for example, is in the group labeled 111.212 (periods are usually added after every third digit to make long numbers easier to read). A long classification number does not necessarily indicate the instrument is a complicated one. The [[Bugle (instrument)|valveless bugle]] for instance, has the classification number 423.121.22, even though it is generally regarded as a relatively simple instrument (it is basically a bent conical tube which you blow down like a [[trumpet]], but it does not have valves or finger-holes). The numbers in the bugle's classification indicate the following:
* '''4''' – an aerophone
* '''42''' – the vibrating air is enclosed within the instrument
* '''423''' – the player's lips cause the air to vibrate directly (as opposed to an instrument with a reed like a [[clarinet]], or an edge-blown instrument, like a [[flute]])
* '''423.1''' – the player's lips are the only means of changing the instrument's pitch (that is, there are no valves as on a trumpet)
* '''423.12''' – the instrument is tubular, rather than being a [[conch]]-type instrument
* '''423.121''' – the player blows into the end of the tube, as opposed to the side of the tube
* '''423.121.2''' – the tube is bent or folded, as opposed to straight
* '''423.121.22''' – the instrument has a [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]

423.121.22 does not uniquely identify the bugle, but rather identifies the bugle as a certain kind of instrument which has much in common with other instruments in the same class. Another instrument classified as 423.121.22 is the bronze [[lur]], an instrument dating back to the [[Bronze Age]].

==Suffixes and composite instruments==
After the number described above, a number of [[suffix]]es may be appended. An '''8''' indicates that the instrument has a keyboard attached, while a '''9''' indicates the instrument is mechanically driven. In addition to these, there are a number of suffixes unique to each of the top-level groups indicating details not considered crucial to the fundamental nature of the instrument. In the membranophone class, for instance, suffixes can indicate whether the skin of a drum is glued, nailed or tied to its body; in the chordophone class, suffixes can indicate whether the strings are plucked with fingers or plectrum, or played with a bow.

There are ways to classify instruments with this system even if they have elements from more than one group. Such instruments may have particularly long classification numbers with colons and hyphens used as well as numbers. Hornbostel and Sachs themselves cite the case of various [[bagpipe]]s where some of the pipes are single reed (like a clarinet) and others are double reed (like the [[oboe]]). A number of similar composite instruments exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3783">In algebra, the '''integral closure''' of an ideal ''I'' of a commutative ring ''R'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;\overline{I}&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all elements ''r'' in ''R'' that are integral over ''I'': there exist &lt;math&gt;a_i \in I^i&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;r^n + a_1 r^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-1} r + a_n = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
It is similar to the [[integral closure]] of a subring. For example, if ''R'' is a domain, an element ''r'' in ''R'' belongs to &lt;math&gt;\overline{I}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is a finitely generated ''R''-module ''M'', annihilated only by ''r'', such that &lt;math&gt;r M \subset I M&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;\overline{I}&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal of ''R'' (in fact, the integral closure of an ideal is always an ideal; see below.) ''I'' is said to be '''integrally closed''' if &lt;math&gt;I = \overline{I}&lt;/math&gt;.

The integral closure of an ideal appears in a theorem of [[David Rees (mathematician)|Rees]] that characterizes an [[analytically unramified ring]].

== Examples ==
*In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}[x, y]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^i y^{d-i}&lt;/math&gt; is integral over &lt;math&gt;(x^d, y^d)&lt;/math&gt;.
*[[Radical ideal]]s (e.g., prime ideals) are integrally closed. The intersection of integrally closed ideals is integrally closed.
*In a [[normal ring]], for any non-zerodivisor ''x'' and any ideal ''I'', &lt;math&gt;\overline{xI} = x \overline{I}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, in a normal ring, a principal ideal generated by a non-zerodivisor is integrally closed.
*Let &lt;math&gt;R = k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]&lt;/math&gt; be a polynomial ring over a field ''k''. An ideal ''I'' in ''R'' is called [[monomial ideal|monomial]] if it is generated by monomials; i.e., &lt;math&gt;X_1^{a_1} \cdots X_n^{a_n}&lt;/math&gt;. The integral closure of a monomial ideal is monomial.

== Structure results ==
Let ''R'' be a ring. The [[Rees algebra]] &lt;math&gt;R[It] = \oplus_{n \ge 0} I^n t^n&lt;/math&gt; can be used to compute the integral closure of an ideal. The structure result is the following: the integral closure of &lt;math&gt;R[It]&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt;, which is graded, is &lt;math&gt;\oplus_{n \ge 0} \overline{I^n} t^n&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;\overline{I}&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal and &lt;math&gt;\overline{I} = \overline{\overline{I}}&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., the integral closure of an ideal is integrally closed. It also follows that the integral closure of a homogeneous ideal is homogeneous.

The following type of results is called the '''Briancon–Skoda theorem''': let ''R'' be a regular ring and {{mvar|I}} an ideal generated by {{mvar|l}} elements. Then &lt;math&gt;\overline{I^{n+l}} \subset I^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

A theorem of Rees states: let (''R'', ''m'') be a noetherian local ring. Assume it is [[formally equidimensional]] (i.e., the completion is equidimensional.). Then two ''m''-primary ideals &lt;math&gt;I \subset J&lt;/math&gt; have the same integral closure if and only if they have the same [[multiplicity of an ideal|multiplicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swanson|2006|loc=Theorem 11.3.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE)''' is a non-profit international association dedicated to raising awareness and inquiry of [[feminist economics]]. It has approximately six hundred members in sixty-four countries.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.iaffe.org/pages/about-iaffe/history/|publisher=International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE)|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The association publishes a quarterly journal entitled ''[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]]''.&lt;ref name=Purpose&gt;{{cite web |title= Purposes and activities |url= http://www.iaffe.org/pages/about-iaffe/purposes-activities-copy/ |publisher=International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998 IAFFE has held [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] [[Special Consultative Status#Special|special consultative status]].&lt;ref name=Consult&gt;{{cite web | last= Willetts | first= Peter | title= List Non-Governmental Organisations in Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, as of August 2003 - ECOSOC Special Consultative Status | url= http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/p.willetts/NGOS/NGO-2003.HTM#special |publisher=City University London | accessdate=7 June 2014 | quote= 598. International Association for Feminist Economics 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is made up of [[Administrative division|'chapters']] which conduct panel meetings alongside the meetings of other economic groups such as, the [[European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy|European Association for Evolutionary and Political Economy (EAEPE)]] and the [[American Economic Association|American Economic Association (AEA)]].

== History ==
In 1990 [[Diana Strassmann]] organized a panel named, ''Can feminism find a home in economics?'' Members of the audience were invited specifically, by [[Jean Shackelford]] and April Aerni, to join a start-up network for economists which would be overtly feminist in outlook. In 1992 this network became the International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) with Shackleford becoming their first president.&lt;ref name="Beyond"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Nelson | first1 = Julie A. | last2 = Ferber | first2 = Marianne | author-link1 = Julie A.

In 1998 IAFFE was made an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] with [[Special Consultative Status#Special|special consultative status]] to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC)]].&lt;ref name=Consult /&gt;

By 2003 IAFFE had more than five hundred members from over thirty countries.&lt;ref name=Beyond /&gt; The association's president from 2003 to 2004 was [[Lourdes Benería]]. Shahra Razavi paid tribute to Benería in a speech at the IAFFE conference in 2012 describing Benería's work as, "not only empirically grounded and conceptually informed, but also contributing to a feminist critique that is systemic and connected to a broader critique of capitalism".&lt;ref name=Homage&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Adhami|first1=Rheem |last2=Razavi |first2=Shahra| title= Paying Homage: Shahra Razavi on the life and work of feminist economist Lourdes Benería|url=http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BE6B5/search/394D8E693A63B3BFC1257A33004A3816?OpenDocument|publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD)|accessdate=7 June 2014|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IAFFE was awarded a grant of $1.5&amp;nbsp;million in 2010 from the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA)]], to continue their work, including the publication of special issues of ''Feminist Economics''.&lt;ref name=SIDA&gt;{{cite web |title=International feminist organization based at UNL earns $1.5 million grant |url=http://newsroom.unl.edu/releases/2010/01/22/International+feminist+organization+based+at+UNL+earns+$1.5+M+grant |publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) |accessdate=7 June 2014 |date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the association has gone on to number six hundred members in sixty-four countries.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;

== Chapters ==

=== European chapter ===
At the same time as IAFFE was setting up, a separate group of women, including [[Edith Kuiper]], in the Netherlands organized a conference on feminist perspectives on economic theory called ''Out of the Margins''. The conference brought many like minded people together who continued to network with one another and be involved in groups and activism, sometimes involving the IAFFE. (Another small group of Dutch economists founded another organization named FENN, the Feminist Economics Network in the Netherlands). In 1998, at a second Amsterdam conference, arrangements were made to hold the first meeting of IAFFE European chapter.&lt;ref name="Beyond_2"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Nelson | first1 = Julie A. | last2 = Ferber | first2 = Marianne | author-link1 = Julie A. Nelson | author-link2 = Marianne Ferber | contribution = Introduction - 'Beyond economic man', ten years later | editor-last1 = Nelson | editor-first1 = Julie A. | editor-last2 = Ferber | editor-first2 = Marianne | editor-link1 = Julie A. Nelson | editor-link2 = Marianne Ferber | title = Feminist economics today: beyond economic man | pages = 8–9 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780226242071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official meeting of IAFFE Europe took place in Brussels in November 1998, there were twenty-five participants from ten countries and, as a result of the meeting, an e-mail list was created. Information about futures sessions and a report of the first meeting was sent to those interested, this led to more IAFFE panels (in 1999 and 2000) being organized for meetings of the [[European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy|European Association for Evolutionary and Political Economy (EAEPE)]].&lt;ref name=Beyond_2 /&gt;

The European chapter of IAFFE continued to meet and [[Ailsa McKay]], professor of economics at [[Glasgow Caledonian University]], was its chair until her death in March 2014.&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Catriona |title=Tributes for Caley Uni professor Ailsa |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/tributes-for-caley-uni-professor-ailsa-154863n.23623353 |accessdate=7 June 2014 |newspaper=Evening Times|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian and New Zealand Association for Feminist Economics (ANZAFFE) ===
The ''Out of the Margins'' conference resulted in a network of contacts being formed, one of these networks gradually became the Australian and New Zealand Association for Feminist Economics (ANZAFFE), a chapter of IAFFE. The chapter includes a small feminist economics group in Wellington, New Zealand led by [[Prue Hyman]].&lt;ref name=Beyond_2 /&gt;

=== United States chapter ===
The American chapter of IAFFE hold sessions at the [[American Economic Association|American Economic Association's (AEA)]] annual meetings.&lt;ref name=Beyond_2 /&gt;

== The Rhonda Williams Prize ==
IAFFE offer a prize scholarship in memory of former associate editor of ''Feminist Economics'' (1994–1998), Rhonda Williams. In 2014 the amount awarded was $1,500 to be given out at their summer conference to allow underrepresented groups in IAFFE attend the conference and present a paper.

Award winners must demonstrate a commitment to one or more of the following issues: inequalities; interrelationships (racism, sexism, homophobia, and classism); and connections between scholarship and activism. Funding is provided by both [[Routledge]] and, [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;ref name=RW_prize&gt;{{cite web|title=Upcoming Events|url=http://www.diversifyingecon.org/index.php/Upcoming_Events|publisher=Diversifying Economic Quality (Div.

== Conferences ==
IAFFE takes part in [[Allied Social Sciences Association|Allied Social Sciences Association's (ASSA)]] annual conference every year.&lt;ref name=Econ_Biz&gt;{{cite web|title=IAFFE Sessions at ASSA Conference|url=http://www.econbiz.de/events/event/iaffe-sessions-at-assa-conference/10005873761|publisher=EconBiz|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has its own annual conferences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4870">The term "'''inverse consequences'''"&lt;ref name=AU/&gt; or the "'''Law of Inverse Consequences'''"&lt;ref name=NCSU/&gt; refers to results that are the opposite of the expected results as initially intended or planned.&lt;ref name="NCSU"&gt;

One consequence is in the "reverse predicament" of the other.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;

==History==
The term "inverse consequences" has been in use for over 175 years (since at least 1835).&lt;ref name="AU"&gt;

  states "the influence of which upon them will be manifested
  by inverse consequences; the one being in the reverse
  predicament of the other."
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term was also used by [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) in his book ''System of Positive Polity'' (published 1875), stating, "Inevitable increase in Complication, in proportion with the decrease of Generality, gives rise to two inverse consequences."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19255">The '''language of thought hypothesis''' ('''LOTH'''),&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes known as '''thought ordered mental expression''' ('''TOME'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language as grist to the mill of cognition.|author=Tillas A.|journal=Cogn Process|date=2015-08-16|doi=10.1007/s10339-015-0656-2|pmid=25976728}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a view in [[linguistics]], [[philosophy of mind]] and [[cognitive science]], forwarded by American philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]]. It describes the nature of thought as possessing "language-like" or compositional structure (sometimes known as ''mentalese''). On this view, simple concepts combine in systematic ways (akin to the rules of grammar in language) to build thoughts. In its most basic form, the theory states that thought, like language, has syntax.

Using empirical data drawn from linguistics and cognitive science to describe [[mental representation]] from a philosophical vantage-point, the hypothesis states that thinking takes place in a language of thought (LOT): [[cognition]] and cognitive processes are only 'remotely plausible' when expressed as a system of representations that is "tokened" by a linguistic or semantic structure and operated upon by means of a combinatorial syntax.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; Linguistic tokens used in mental language describe elementary concepts which are operated upon by logical rules establishing causal connections to allow for complex thought. Syntax as well as semantics have a causal effect on the properties of this system of mental representations.

These mental representations are not present in the [[Human brain|brain]] in the same way as symbols are present on paper; rather, the LOT is supposed to exist at the cognitive level, the level of thoughts and concepts. The LOTH has wide-ranging significance for a number of domains in [[cognitive science]]. It relies on a version of functionalist materialism, which holds that mental representations are actualized and modified by the individual holding the propositional attitude, and it challenges [[eliminative materialism]] and [[connectionism]]. It implies a strongly [[rationalism|rationalist]] model of cognition in which many of the fundamentals of cognition are innate.&lt;ref name="murataydede" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Language of Thought|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XZwGLBYLbg4C|publisher = Harvard University Press|date = 1975-01-01|isbn = 9780674510302|language = en|first = Jerry A.|last = Fodor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presentation ==
The hypothesis applies to thoughts that have propositional content, and is not meant to describe everything that goes on in the mind. It appeals to the representational theory of thought to explain what those tokens actually are and how they behave. There must be a mental representation that stands in some unique relationship with the subject of the representation and has specific content. Complex thoughts get their semantic content from the content of the basic thoughts and the relations that they hold to each other. Thoughts can only relate to each other in ways that do not violate the syntax of thought. The syntax by means of which these two sub-parts are combined can be expressed in [[first-order predicate calculus]].

The thought "John is tall" is clearly composed of two sub-parts, the concept of John and the concept of tallness, combined in a manner that may be expressed in first-order predicate calculus as a predicate 'T' ("is tall") that holds of the entity 'j' (John). A fully articulated proposal for what a LOT would have to take into account greater complexities such as [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantification]] and [[propositional attitudes]] (the various attitudes people can have towards statements; for example I might ''believe'' or ''see'' or merely ''suspect'' that John is tall).

===Precepts===
# There can be no higher cognitive processes without mental representation. The only plausible psychological models represent higher cognitive processes as representational and computational thought needs a representational system as an object upon which to compute. We must therefore attribute a representational system to organisms for cognition and thought to occur.
# There is causal relationship between our intentions and our actions. Because mental states are structured in a way that causes our intentions to manifest themselves by what we do, there is a connection between how we view the world and ourselves and what we do.

== Reception ==

The language of thought hypothesis has been both controversial and groundbreaking. Some philosophers reject the LOTH, arguing that our public language ''is'' our mental language—a person who speaks English ''thinks'' in English. But others contend that complex thought is present even in those who do not possess a public language (e.g. babies, [[aphasia|aphasics]], and even higher-order primates), and therefore some form of mentalese must be innate. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The notion that mental states are causally efficacious diverges from [[behaviorists]] like [[Gilbert Ryle]], who held that there is no break between the cause of mental state and effect of behavior. Rather, Ryle proposed that people act in some way because they are in a disposition to act in that way, that these causal mental states are representational. An objection to this point comes from [[John Searle]] in the form of [[biological naturalism]], a non-representational theory of mind that accepts the causal efficacy of mental states. Searle divides intentional states into low-level brain activity and high-level mental activity. The lower-level, nonrepresentational neurophysiological processes have causal power in intention and behavior rather than some higher-level mental representation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

[[Tim Crane]], in his book ''The Mechanical Mind'',&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crane|first=Tim|title=The mechanical mind : a philosophical introduction to minds, machines and mental representation|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-29031-9|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415290319/|edition=2nd, repr.|authorlink=Tim Crane}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that, while he agrees with Fodor, his reason is very different. A logical objection challenges LOTH’s explanation of how sentences in natural languages get their meaning. That is the view that “Snow is white” is TRUE if and only if ''P'' is TRUE in the LOT, where ''P'' means the same thing in LOT as “Snow is white” means in the natural language. Any symbol manipulation is in need of some way of deriving what those symbols mean.&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt; If the meaning of sentences is explained regarding sentences in the LOT, then the meaning of sentences in LOT must get their meaning from somewhere else. There seems to be an infinite regress of sentences getting their meaning. Sentences in natural languages get their meaning from their users (speakers, writers).&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt; Therefore, sentences in mentalese must get their meaning from the way in which they are used by thinkers and so on ''ad infinitum''. This regress is often called the [[homunculus]] regress.&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt;

[[Daniel Dennett]] accepts that homunculi may be explained by other homunculi and denies that this would yield an infinite regress of homunculi. Each explanatory homunculus is “stupider” or more basic than the homunculus it explains, but this regress is not infinite but bottoms out at a basic level that is so simple that it does not need interpretation.&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt; John Searle points out that it still follows that the bottom-level homunculi are manipulating some sorts of symbols.

LOTH implies that the mind has some [[tacit knowledge]] of the logical [[rules of inference]] and the linguistic rules of [[syntax]] (sentence structure) and [[semantics]] (concept or word meaning).&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt; If LOTH cannot show that the mind knows that it is following the particular set of rules in question, then the mind is not computational because it is not governed by computational rules.&lt;ref name="murataydede"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/ |title=The Language of Thought Hypothesis |author=Murat Aydede |date=2004-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt; Also, the apparent incompleteness of this set of rules in explaining behavior is pointed out. Many conscious beings behave in ways that are contrary to the rules of logic. Yet this irrational behavior is not accounted for by any rules, showing that there is at least some behavior that does not act by this set of rules.&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt;

Another objection within representational theory of mind has to do with the relationship between propositional attitudes and representation. Dennett points out that a chess program can have the attitude of “wanting to get its queen out early,” without having representation or rule that explicitly states this. A multiplication program on a computer computes in the computer language of 1’s and 0’s, yielding representations that do not correspond with any propositional attitude.&lt;ref name="murataydede"/&gt;

[[Susan Schneider (philosopher)|Susan Schneider]] has recently developed a version of LOT that departs from Fodor's approach in numerous ways. In her book, The Language of Thought: a New Philosophical Direction, Schneider argues that Fodor's pessimism about the success of cognitive science is misguided, and she outlines an approach to LOT that integrates LOT with neuroscience. She also stresses that LOT that is not wedded to the extreme view that all concepts are innate. She fashions a new theory of mental symbols, and a related two-tiered theory of concepts, in which a concept's nature is determined by its LOT symbol type and its meaning.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=Susan|title=The Language of Thought: a New Direction|date=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Boston: Mass|url=https://www.amazon.com/Language-Thought-New-Philosophical-Direction-ebook/dp/B006QTGAC6/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1399489463&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=susan+schneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to connectionism==
Connectionism is an approach to [[artificial intelligence]] that often accepts a lot of the same theoretical framework that LOTH accepts, namely that mental states are computational and causally efficacious and very often that they are representational. However, connectionism stresses the possibility of thinking machines, most often realized as [[artificial neural networks]], an inter-connectional set of nodes, and describes mental states as able to create memory by modifying the strength of these connections over time. Some popular types of neural networks are interpretations of units, and learning algorithm. "Units" can be interpreted as neurons or groups of neurons. A learning algorithm is such that, over time, a change in connection weight is possible, allowing networks to modify their connections. Connectionist neural networks are able to change over time via their activation.  An activation is a numerical value that represents any aspect of a unit that a neural network has at any time. Activation spreading is the spreading or taking over of other  over time of the activation to all other units connected to the activated unit.

Since connectionist models can change over time, supporters of connectionism claim that it can solve the problems that LOTH brings to classical AI. These problems are those that show that machines with a LOT syntactical framework very often are much better at solving problems and storing data than human minds, yet much worse at things that the human mind is quite adept at such as recognizing facial expressions and objects in photographs and understanding nuanced gestures.&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt; Fodor defends LOTH by arguing that a connectionist model is just some realization or implementation of the classical [[computational theory of mind]] and therein necessarily employs a symbol-manipulating LOT.

Fodor and [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] use the notion of [[cognitive architecture]] in their defense. Cognitive architecture is the set of basic functions of an organism with representational input and output. They argue that it is a law of nature that cognitive capacities are productive, systematic and inferentially coherent—they have the ability to produce and understand sentences of a certain structure if they can understand one sentence of that structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/connectionism/ |title=Connectionism |author=James Garson |date=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cognitive model must have a cognitive architecture that explains these laws and properties in some way that is compatible with the scientific method. Fodor and Pylyshyn say that cognitive architecture can only explain the property of systematicity by appealing to a system of representations and that connectionism either employs a cognitive architecture of representations or else does not. If it does, then connectionism uses LOT. If it does not then it is empirically false.&lt;ref name="murataydede"/&gt;

Connectionists have responded to Fodor and Pylyshyn by denying that connectionism uses LOT, by denying that cognition is essentially a function that uses representational input and output or denying that systematicity is a law of nature that rests on representation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Empirical testing ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
Since LOTH came to be it has been empirically tested.  Not all experiments have confirmed the hypothesis;

*In 1971, Roger Shepard and Jacqueline Metzler tested Pylyshyn's particular hypothesis that all symbols are understood by the mind in virtue of their fundamental mathematical descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepard|first1=Roger N.|last2=Metzler|first2=Jacqueline|title=Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects|journal=Science|date=1971-02-19|volume=171|issue=3972|pages=701–703|doi=10.1126/science.171.3972.701|pmid=5540314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shepard and Metzler's experiment consisted of showing a group of subjects a 2-D line drawing of a 3-D object, and then that same object at some rotation. According to Shepard and Metzler, if Pylyshyn were correct, then the amount of time it took to identify the object as the same object would not depend on the degree of rotation of the object. Their finding that the time taken to recognize the object was proportional to its rotation contradicts this hypothesis.
*There may be a connection between prior knowledge of what relations hold between objects in the world and the time it takes subjects to recognize the same objects. For example, it is more likely that subjects will not recognize a hand that is rotated in such a way that it would be physically impossible for an actual hand.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} It has since also been empirically tested and supported that the mind might better manipulate mathematical descriptions in topographical wholes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} These findings have illuminated what the mind is not doing in terms of how it manipulates symbols.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
*Certain deaf adults who neither have capability to learn a spoken language nor have access to a sign language, known as home signers, in fact communicate with both others like them and the outside world using gestures and self-created signing. Although they have no experience in language or how it works, they are able to conceptualize more than iconic words but move into the abstract, suggesting that they could understand that before creating a gesture to show it.&lt;ref&gt;Coppola, M., &amp; Brentari, D. (2014). From iconic handshapes to grammatical contrasts: longitudinal evidence from a child homesigner. Frontiers in Psychology, 5, 830. [http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00830]&lt;/ref&gt; Ildefonso, a homesigner who learned a main sign language at twenty-seven years of age, found that although his thinking became easier to communicate, he had lost his ability to communicate with other homesigners as well as recall how his thinking worked without language.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, G. (2010, July 21). Life without language. Retrieved December 19, 2015, from [http://neuroanthropology.net/2010/07/21/life-without-language/]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Other studies that have been done to discover what thought processes could be non-lingual include a study done in 1969 by Berlin and Kay which indicated that the color spectrum was perceived the same no matter how many words a language had for different colors, and a study done in 1981 and fixed 1983 which alluded, that counterfactuals are processed at the same rate, ease of conveying through words notwithstanding.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, P., &amp; Keil, F. (2001, September 1). Thinking Through Language. Retrieved December 19, 2015, from [http://www.yale.edu/minddevlab/papers/bloom.keil.thinking.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maurits (2011) describes an experiment to measure the [[word order]] of the language of thought by the relative time needed to recall the verb, agent, and patient of an event. It turned out that the agent was recalled most quickly and the verb least quickly, leading to a conclusion of a [[subject–object–verb]] language of thought (SOVLOT).&lt;ref name="Maurits"&gt;Luke Maurits.

A '''legal doctrine''' is a framework, set of rules, procedural steps, or test, often established through [[precedent]] in the [[common law]], through which judgments can be determined in a given legal case. A doctrine comes about when a judge makes a ruling where a process is outlined and applied, and allows for it to be equally applied to like cases. When enough judges make use of the process, soon enough{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2017}} it becomes established as the ''[[de facto]]'' method of deciding like situations.

In [[geometry]] and [[topology]], the '''line at infinity''' is a [[projective line]] that is added to the real (affine) [[plane (geometry)|plane]] in order to give closure to, and remove the exceptional cases from, the [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]] properties of the resulting [[projective plane]].  The line at infinity is also called the '''ideal line'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weisstein|first1=Eric W.|title=Line at Infinity|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LineatInfinity.html|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|publisher=Wolfram Research|accessdate=28 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric formulation==
In projective geometry, any pair of lines always intersects at some point, but [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines do not intersect in the real plane.  The line at infinity is added to the real plane. This completes the plane, because now parallel lines intersect at a point which lies on the line at infinity. Also, if any pair of lines intersect at a point on the line at infinity, then the pair of lines are parallel.

Every line intersects the line at infinity at some point. The point at which the parallel lines intersect depends only on the [[slope]] of the lines, not at all on their [[y-intercept]].

In the affine plane, a line extends in two opposite directions. In the projective plane, the two opposite directions of a line meet each other at a point on the line at infinity.  Therefore, lines in the projective plane are [[closed curve]]s, i.e., they are cyclical rather than linear. This is true of the line at infinity itself; it meets itself at its two endpoints (which are therefore not actually endpoints at all) and so it is actually cyclical.

==Topological perspective==
The line at infinity can be visualized as a circle which surrounds the affine plane.  However, diametrically opposite points of the circle are equivalent—they are the same point. The combination of the affine plane and the line at infinity makes the [[real projective plane]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}P^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--''RP&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''--&gt;.

A [[hyperbola]] can be seen as a closed curve which intersects the line at infinity in two different points.  These two points are specified by the slopes of the two [[asymptote]]s of the hyperbola.  Likewise, a [[parabola]] can be seen as a closed curve which intersects the line at infinity in a single point.  This point is specified by the slope of the axis of the parabola.  If the parabola is cut by its vertex into a symmetrical pair of "horns", then these two horns become more parallel to each other further away from the vertex, and are actually parallel to the axis and to each other at infinity, so that they intersect at the line at infinity.

The analogue for the complex projective plane is a 'line' at infinity that is (naturally) a complex [[projective line]]. Topologically this is quite different, in that it is a [[Riemann sphere]], which is therefore a 2-[[sphere]], being added to a complex affine space of two dimensions over ''C'' (so four ''real'' dimensions), resulting in a four-dimensional [[compact space|compact]] [[manifold]]. The result is [[orientable]], while the real projective plane is not.

==History==
The complex line at infinity was much used in nineteenth century geometry. In fact one of the most applied tricks was to regard a circle as a [[conic]] constrained to pass through two points at infinity, the solutions of

:''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.

This equation is the form taken by that of any circle when we drop terms of lower order in ''X'' and ''Y''. More formally, we should use [[homogeneous coordinates]]

:[''X:Y:Z'']

and note that the line at infinity is specified by setting

: ''Z'' = 0.

Making equations homogeneous by introducing powers of ''Z'', and then setting ''Z'' = 0, does precisely eliminate terms of lower order.

Solving the equation, therefore, we find that all circles 'pass through' the ''[[circular points at infinity]]''

:''I'' = [1:''i'':0] and ''J'' = [1:&amp;minus;''i'':0].

These of course are complex points, for any representing set of homogeneous coordinates. Since the projective plane has a large enough [[symmetry group]], they are in no way special, though. The conclusion is that the three-parameter family of circles can be treated as a special case of the [[Linear system of divisors|linear system]] of conics passing through two given distinct points ''P'' and ''Q''. &lt;!--REMOVED UNCITED TEXT: This idea was used so often that a schoolmasterly joke arose, naming the circular points at infinity ''Isaac'' and ''Jacob'', respectively.--&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11972">In [[mathematics]] and especially [[number theory]], the '''sum of reciprocals''' generally is computed for the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s of some or all of the [[positive number|positive]] [[integer]]s (counting numbers)&amp;mdash;that is, it is generally the sum of [[unit fraction]]s.  If infinitely many numbers have their reciprocals summed, generally the terms are given in a certain sequence and the first ''n'' of them are summed, then one more is included to give the sum of the first ''n''+1 of them, etc.

If only finitely many numbers are included, the key issue is usually to find a simple expression for the value of the sum, or to require the sum to be less than a certain value, or to determine whether the sum is ever an integer.

For an [[infinite series]] of reciprocals, the issues are twofold: First, does the sequence of sums [[divergent series|diverge]]—that is, does it eventually exceed any given number—or does it [[convergent series|converge]], meaning there is some number that it gets arbitrarily close to without ever exceeding it? (A set of positive integers is said to be [[large set (combinatorics)|large]] if the sum of its reciprocals diverges, and small if it converges.) Second, if it converges, what is a simple expression for the value it converges to, is that value [[rational number|rational]] or [[irrational number|irrational]], and is that value [[algebraic number|algebraic]] or [[transcendental number|transcendental]]?&lt;ref&gt;Unless given here, references are in the linked articles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finitely many terms==

*The [[harmonic mean]] of a set of positive integers is the number of numbers times the reciprocal of the sum of their reciprocals.
*The [[optic equation]] requires the sum of the reciprocals of two positive integers ''a'' and ''b'' to equal the reciprocal of a third positive integer ''c''. All solutions are given by ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mn''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mn''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mn''. This equation appears in various contexts in elementary [[geometry]].
*The [[Fermat–Catalan conjecture]] concerns a certain [[Diophantine equation]], equating the sum of two terms, each a positive integer raised to a positive integer power, to a third term that is also a positive integer raised to a positive integer power (with the base integers having no prime factor in common). The conjecture asks whether the equation has an infinitude of solutions in which the sum of the reciprocals of the three exponents in the equation must be less than 1. The purpose of this restriction is to preclude the known infinitude of solutions in which two exponents are 2 and the other exponent is any even number.
*The ''n''-th [[harmonic number]], which is the sum of the reciprocals of the first ''n'' positive integers, is never an integer except for the case&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.
*Moreover, [[József Kürschák]] proved in 1918 that the sum of the reciprocals of consecutive natural numbers (whether starting from 1 or not) is never an integer.
*The sum of the [[Divergence of the sum of the reciprocals of the primes#Partial sums|reciprocals of the first ''n'' primes]] is not an integer for any ''n''.
*There are [[215 (number)|215]] non-consecutive sequences of four integers, counting re-arrangements as distinct, such that the sum of their reciprocals is 1. There are 14 of them if rearrangements are not allowed.
*An [[Egyptian fraction]] is the sum of a finite number of reciprocals of positive integers. According to the proof of the [[Erdős–Graham problem]], if the set of [[integer]]s greater than one is [[Partition of a set|partition]]ed into finitely many subsets, then one of the subsets can be used to form an [[Egyptian fraction]] representation of 1.
*The [[Erdős–Straus conjecture]] states that for all integers ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, the rational number 4/''n''  can be expressed as the sum of three reciprocals of integers.
*The [[Fermat quotient#Special values|Fermat quotient]] with base 2, which is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2^{p-1}-1}{p}&lt;/math&gt; for odd prime ''p'', when expressed in [[modular arithmetic|mod]] ''p'' and multiplied by –2, equals the sum of the reciprocals mod&amp;nbsp;''p'' of the numbers lying in the first half of the range&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1}.
*In any [[triangle]], the sum of the reciprocals of the [[altitude (triangle)#Inradius theorems|altitudes]] equals the reciprocal of the [[radius]] of the [[incircle]] (regardless of whether or not they are integers).
*In a [[right triangle]], the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the altitudes from the legs (equivalently, of the squares of the legs themselves) equals the reciprocal of the square of the altitude from the hypotenuse. This holds whether or not the numbers are integers; there is a formula (see [[integer triangle#Pythagorean triangles with integer altitude from the hypotenuse|here]]) that generates all integer cases.
*A triangle not necessarily in the [[Euclidean plane]] can be specified as having angles &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{p},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{q},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{r}.&lt;/math&gt; Then the triangle is in Euclidean space if the sum of the reciprocals of ''p, q,'' and ''r'' equals 1, [[spherical trigonometry|spherical space]] if that sum is greater than 1, and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic space]] if the sum is less than 1.
*A [[harmonic divisor number]] is a positive integer whose divisors have a [[harmonic mean]] that is an integer. The first five of these are 1, 6, 28, 140, and 270. It is not known whether any harmonic divisor numbers are odd, but there are no odd ones less than 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The sum of the reciprocals of the [[divisor]]s of a [[perfect number]] is 2.
*When eight points are distributed on the surface of a [[sphere]] with the aim of maximizing the distance between them in some sense, the resulting shape corresponds to a [[square antiprism]].  Specific methods of distributing the points include, for example, minimizing the sum of all reciprocals of squares of distances between points.

==Etymology==
The term 'lucid dream' was coined by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] author and [[psychiatrist]] [[Frederik van Eeden]] in his 1913 article ''A Study of Dreams'',&lt;ref name="Frederik van Eeden 1997" /&gt; though descriptions of dreamers being aware that they are dreaming predates the actual term. Frederik Van Eeden studied his personal dreams since 1896. He wrote down the most interesting ones and out of all these dreams, 352 were what we know now as “lucid dreams”. Throughout all the data he collected from dreaming, he created different names for different types of dreams. He named 7 different types of dreams; Initial dreams, pathological, ordinary dreaming, vivid dreaming, demoniacal, general- dream-sensations, and lastly lucid dreaming. Frederick Van Eeden said the seventh type of dreaming, lucid dreaming, was the most interesting and worthy of the most careful observation of study. Eeden studied lucid dreaming between January 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1898 through December 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1912. In this state of dreaming Eeden explains that you are completely aware of your surroundings and are able to direct your actions freely, yet the sleep is stimulating and uninterrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lucidity.com/vanEeden.html|title=A Study of Dreams|last=Eeden|first=Frederik|date=|website=lucidity.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Ancient===
Early references to the phenomenon are found in ancient Greek writing. For example, the philosopher [[Aristotle]] wrote: 'often when one is asleep, there is something in consciousness which declares that what then presents itself is but a dream'.&lt;ref name="Mavromatis1987" /&gt; Meanwhile, the physician [[Galen of Pergamon]] used lucid dreams as a form of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Véronique Boudon-Meillot |title=Galien de Pergame. Un médecin grec à Rome |publisher=Les Belles Lettres, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, a letter written by [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]] in 415 AD tells the story of a dreamer, Doctor Gennadius, and refers to lucid dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dreamstudies.org/2009/10/08/lucid-dreaming-and-christianity/|title="Lucid Dreaming and Christianity: Entering the Light"|date=October 8, 2009|first=Ryan|last=Hurd|publisher=Dream Studies Portal|access-date=Mar 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102159.htm |title=Letter from St. Augustine of Hippo |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2009-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Eastern thought, cultivating the dreamer's ability to be aware that he or she is dreaming is central to both the Tibetan Buddhist practice of [[dream Yoga]], and the ancient Indian [[Hinduism|Hindu]] practice of [[Yoga nidra]]. The cultivation of such awareness was common practice among early [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].&lt;ref&gt;Tse-fu Kuan (2008), Mindfulness in Early Buddhism: New Approaches through Psychology and Textual Analysis of Pali, Chinese and Sanskrit Sources (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism)&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
Philosopher and physician [[Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605–1682)  was fascinated by dreams and described his own ability to lucid dream in his ''[[Religio Medici]]'', stating: '...yet in one dream I can compose a whole Comedy, behold the action, apprehend the jests and laugh my self-awake at the conceits thereof'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Religio Medici]], part 2:11. Text available at http://penelope.uchicago.edu/relmed/relmed.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, [[Samuel Pepys]] in his diary entry for 15 August 1665 records a dream, stating: "I had my Lady Castlemayne in my arms and was admitted to use all the dalliance I desired with her, and then dreamt that this could not be awake, but that it was only a dream".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1665/08/15/|title=Tuesday 15 August 1665|work=The Diary of Samuel Pepys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
In 1867, the French sinologist [[Marie-Jean-Léon, Marquis d'Hervey de Saint Denys]]  anonymously published ''Les Rêves et Les Moyens de Les Diriger; Observations Pratiques'' ('Dreams and the ways to direct them; practical observations'), in which he describes his own experiences of lucid dreaming, and proposes that it is possible for anyone to learn to dream consciously.&lt;ref&gt;D'Hervey de Saint-Denys, Les Rêves et Les Moyens de Les Diriger; Observations Pratiques, Paris/Amyot.

===20th century===
[[File:EedenSaintDenys.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Frederik van Eeden]] and [[Marie-Jean-Léon, Marquis d'Hervey de Saint Denys|Marquis d'Hervey de Saint Denys]], pioneers of lucid dreaming.|right]]
In 1913, Dutch psychiatrist and writer [[Frederik Willem van Eeden|Frederik (Willem) van Eeden]] (1860–1932) coined the term 'lucid dream' in an article entitled ''"A Study of Dreams"''.&lt;ref name="Frederik van Eeden 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frederik van Eeden|year=1913|url=http://www.lucidity.com/vanEeden.html|title=A study of Dreams|journal=Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research |volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mavromatis1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andreas Mavromatis|title=Hypnogogia: The Unique State of Consciousness Between Wakefullness and Sleep|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dGgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=29 April 2013|year=1987|publisher=Routledge, Chapman &amp; Hall, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-7102-0282-6|page=96|quote=The lucid dream, a term coined by van Eeden himself, had already been noted by Aristotle who wrote that 'often when...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bulkeley1999" /&gt;

Some have suggested that the term is a misnomer because van Eeden was referring to a phenomenon more specific than a lucid dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Lucid Dreaming: Awake in Your Sleep? |url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Articles/si91ld.html |first=Susan |last=Blackmore |authorlink=Susan Blackmore |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |year=1991 |volume=15 |pages=362–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eeden intended the term lucid to denote "having insight", as in the phrase ''a lucid interval'' applied to someone in temporary remission from a [[psychosis]], rather than as a reference to the perceptual quality of the experience, which may or may not be clear and vivid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lucidity.com/LucidDreamingFAQ2.html|title=Lucid Dreaming Frequently Asked Questions Answered by Lucidity Institute|work=lucidity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific research==
In 1968, [[Celia Green]] analyzed the main characteristics of such dreams, reviewing previously published literature on the subject and incorporating new data from participants of her own. She concluded that lucid dreams were a category of experience quite distinct from ordinary dreams, and said they were associated with [[rapid eye movement sleep]] (REM sleep). Green was also the first to link lucid dreams to the phenomenon of [[false awakening]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Green, C. (1968). ''Lucid Dreams'', London: Hamish Hamilton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucid dreaming was subsequently researched by asking dreamers to perform pre-determined physical responses while experiencing a dream, including eye movement signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watanabe Tsuneo |date = March 2003|title=Lucid Dreaming: Its Experimental Proof and Psychological Conditions |journal=Journal of International Society of Life Information Science |location=Japan |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=159–162 |quote=The occurrence of lucid dreaming (dreaming while being conscious that one is dreaming) has been verified for four selected subjects who signaled that they knew they were dreaming. The signals consisted of particular dream actions having observable concomitants and were performed in accordance with a pre-sleep agreement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laberge-experiments1"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.lucidity.com/SleepAndCognition.html |chapter=Lucid Dreaming: Psychophysiological Studies of Consciousness during REM Sleep |first=Stephen |last=LaBerge |editor=Richard R.

In 1980, [[Stephen LaBerge]] at [[Stanford University]] developed such techniques as part of his doctoral dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;Laberge, S. (1980). Lucid dreaming: An exploratory study of consciousness during sleep. (PhD thesis, Stanford University, 1980), (University Microfilms No. 80-24, 691)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, LaBerge performed a pilot study that showed that [[time perception]] while counting during a lucid dream is about the same as during waking life. Lucid dreamers counted out ten seconds while dreaming, signaling the start and the end of the count with a pre-arranged eye signal measured with [[electrooculography|electrooculogram]] recording.&lt;ref name="laberge-experiments2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=LaBerge, S. |year=2000 |url=http://www.lucidity.com/slbbs/index.html |title=Lucid dreaming: Evidence and methodology |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages= 962–63 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00574020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaBerge, Stephen (1990). in Bootzin, R.R., Kihlstrom, J.F. &amp; Schacter, D.L., (Eds.): Lucid Dreaming: Psychophysiological Studies of Consciousness during REM Sleep Sleep and Cognition.

In a further study by Stephen LaBerge, four subjects were compared either singing while dreaming or counting while dreaming. LaBerge found that the right hemisphere was more active during singing and the left hemisphere was more active during counting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=LaBerge S. |author2=Dement W.C. | year = 1982b | title = Lateralization of alpha activity for dreamed singing and counting during REM sleep | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.1982.tb02567.x | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 331–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neuroscientist]] [[Allan Hobson|J. Allan Hobson]] has hypothesized what might be occurring in the brain while lucid. The first step to lucid dreaming is recognizing one is dreaming. This recognition might occur in the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], which is one of the few areas deactivated during REM sleep and where [[working memory]] occurs. Once this area is activated and the recognition of dreaming occurs, the dreamer must be cautious to let the dream continue but be conscious enough to remember that it is a dream. While maintaining this balance, the [[amygdala]] and [[parahippocampal cortex]] might be less intensely activated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Muzur A., Pace-Schott E.F. |author2=Allan Hobson |date=November 2002 |url=http://www.bostonneuropsa.org/PDF%20Files/Pace-Schott/MUZUR_ET_AL.__02.pdf |format=PDF |title=The prefrontal cortex in sleep |journal=Trends Cogn Sci |volume=6 |pages=475–81 |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01992-7 |issue=11 |pmid=12457899 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630033042/http://www.bostonneuropsa.org/PDF%20Files/Pace-Schott/MUZUR_ET_AL.__02.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To continue the intensity of the dream hallucinations, it is expected the [[pons]] and the [[parietal lobe|parieto-occipital junction]] stay active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hobson |first=J.

Using [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) and other polysomnographical measurements, LaBerge and others have shown that lucid dreams begin in the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) stage of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ogilvie R. |author2=Hunt H. |author3=Sawicki C. |author4=McGowan K. | year = 1978 | title = Searching for lucid dreams | url = | journal = Sleep Research | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harms|first=R.

(1986) Lucid dreaming: physiological correlates of consciousness during REM sleep. ''Journal of Mind and Behavior'' 7: 251(121)–8(8).&lt;/ref&gt; LaBerge also proposes that there are higher amounts of beta-1 frequency band (13–19&amp;nbsp;Hz) brain wave activity experienced by lucid dreamers, hence there is an increased amount of activity in the [[parietal lobe]]s making lucid dreaming a conscious process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Holzinger B. |author2=LaBerge S. |author3=Levitan L. | year = 2006 | title = Psychophysiological correlates of lucid dreaming | url = | journal = American Psychological Association | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 88–95 | doi = 10.1037/1053-0797.16.2.88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Tholey, a German [[Gestalt Psychology|Gestalt psychologist]] and a professor of psychology and [[sports science]], originally studied dreams in order to answer the question if one dreams in colour or black and white. In his phenomenological research, he outlined an epistemological frame using [[Critical realism (philosophy of perception)|critical realism]].&lt;ref&gt; Tholey, Paul (1980). ''Erkenntnistheoretische und systemtheoretische Grundlagen der Sensumotorik aus gestalttheoretischer Sicht.'' In: ''Sportwissenschaft.'' 10, S. 7–35. &lt;/ref&gt; Tholey instructed his probands to continuously suspect waking life to be a dream, in order that such a habit would manifest itself during dreams. He called this technique for inducing lucid dreams the ''Reflexionstechnik'' reflection technique.&lt;ref&gt; Tholey, Paul (1983). ''Techniques for inducing and manipulating lucid dreams''. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 57, 1983, pp. 79–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Probands learned to have such lucid dreams; they observed their dream content and reported it soon after awakening. Tholey could examine the cognitive abilities of dream figures.&lt;ref&gt; Tholey, Paul, (1983). ''Cognitive abilities of dream figures in lucid dreams''. In: Lucidity Letter, p. 71. &lt;/ref&gt; Nine trained lucid dreamers were directed to set other dream figures arithmetic and verbal tasks during lucid dreaming. Dream figures who agreed to perform the tasks proved more successful in verbal than in arithmetic tasks. Tholey discussed his scientific results with Stephen LaBerge, who has a similar approach.&lt;ref&gt;Tholey, Paul (1991). Conversation Between Stephen LaBerge and Paul Tholey in July of 1989. B. Holzinger (ed.). Lucidity, 10(1&amp;2), 1991, pp. 62–71.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Alternative theories===
Other researchers suggest that lucid dreaming is not a state of sleep, but of brief wakefulness, or "micro-awakening".&lt;ref name="schwartz"&gt;Schwartz, B.A.; Lefebvre, A. (1973). [Conjunction of waking and REM sleep. II Fragmented REM periods.] [in French] Revue d'Electroencephalographie et de Neurophysiologie Clinique, 3, 165–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hartmann"&gt;Hartmann, E. (1975). Dreams and other hallucinations: an approach to the underlying mechanism. In R.K. Siegal &amp; L.J. West (Eds.), Hallucinations (pp. 71–79). New York: J. Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments by [[Stephen LaBerge]] used "perception of the outside world" as a criterion for [[wakefulness]] while studying lucid dreamers, and their sleep state was corroborated with physiological measurements.&lt;ref name="laberge-experiments1" /&gt; LaBerge's subjects experienced their lucid dream while in a state of REM, which critics felt may mean that the subjects are fully awake. J Allen Hobson responded that lucid dreaming must be a state of both waking and dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/IJoDR/article/view/403/pdf_1|title=The Neurobiology of Consciousness: Lucid Dreaming Wakes Up|author=J. Allan Hobson|publisher=Harvard Medical School|date=October 2009|access-date=Mar 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Norman Malcolm]] has argued against the possibility of checking the accuracy of dream reports, pointing out that "the only criterion of the truth of a statement that someone has had a certain dream is, essentially, his saying so."&lt;ref name="malcolm"&gt;Malcolm, N. (1959) ''Dreaming''. London:Routledge and Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Paul Tholey]] laid the [[epistemological]] basis for the research of lucid dreams, proposing seven different conditions of clarity that a dream must fulfill in order to be defined as a lucid dream:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tholey|first1=P.|year=1980|title=Klarträume als Gegenstand empirischer Untersuchungen [Conscious Dreams as an Object of Empirical Examination]|url=|journal=Gestalt Theory|volume=2|issue=|pages=175–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tholey|first1=P.|year=1981|title=Empirische Untersuchungen über Klartraüme [Empirical Examination of Conscious Dreams]|url=|journal=Gestalt Theory|volume=3|issue=|pages=21–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Holzinger B|year=2009|title=Lucid dreaming – dreams of clarity|url=|journal=Contemporary Hypnosis|volume=26|issue=4|pages=216–224|doi=10.1002/ch.390}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Awareness of the dream state (orientation)
#Awareness of the capacity to make decisions
#Awareness of memory functions
#Awareness of self
#Awareness of the dream environment
#Awareness of the meaning of the dream
#Awareness of concentration and focus (the subjective clarity of that state).

Later, in 1992, a study by [[Deirdre Barrett]] examined whether lucid dreams contained four "[[corollaries]]" of lucidity:
*The dreamer is aware that they are dreaming
*Objects disappear after waking
*Physical laws need not apply in the dream
*The dreamer has a clear memory of the waking world
Barrett found less than a quarter of lucidity accounts exhibited all four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asdreams.org/journal/issues/asdj2-04.htm#Barrett|title=DREAMING 2(4) Abstracts - The Journal of the Association for the Study of Dreams|work=asdreams.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, [[Stephen LaBerge]] studied the prevalence of being able to control the dream scenario among lucid dreams, and found that while dream control and dream awareness are correlated, neither requires the other. LaBerge found dreams that exhibit one clearly without the capacity for the other; also, in some dreams where the dreamer is lucid and aware they could exercise control, they choose simply to observe.&lt;ref name="Kahan 1994" /&gt;

==Prevalence and frequency==
In 2016, a meta-analytic study by David Saunders and colleagues &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saunders|first=David T.|last2=Roe|first2=Chris A.|last3=Smith|first3=Graham|last4=Clegg|first4=Helen|title=Lucid dreaming incidence: A quality effects meta-analysis of 50 years of research|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053810016301283|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=43|pages=197–215|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2016.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 34 lucid dreaming studies, taken from a period of 50 years, demonstrated that 55% of a pooled sample of 24,282 people claimed to have experienced lucid dreams at least once or more in their lifetime. Furthermore, for those that stated they did experience lucid dreams, approximately 23% reported to experience them on a regular basis, as often as once a month or more. 

==Suggested applications==
===Treating nightmares===
It has been suggested that sufferers of [[nightmare]]s could benefit from the ability to be aware they are indeed dreaming. A pilot study was performed in 2006 that showed that lucid dreaming therapy treatment was successful in reducing nightmare frequency. This treatment consisted of exposure to the idea, mastery of the technique, and lucidity exercises. It was not clear what aspects of the treatment were responsible for the success of overcoming nightmares, though the treatment as a whole was said successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=PPS2006075006389 |author1=Spoormaker,-Victor-I |author2=van-den-Bout,-Jan |date = October 2006|title=Lucid Dreaming Treatment for Nightmares: A Pilot Study |journal=Psychotherapy-and-Psychosomatics |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=389–394 |doi= 10.1159/000095446 |pmid=17053341 |quote=Conclusions: LDT seems effective in reducing nightmare frequency, although the primary therapeutic component (i.e. exposure, mastery, or lucidity) remains unclear.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian psychologist Milan Colic has explored the application of principles from [[narrative therapy]] to clients' lucid dreams, to reduce the impact not only of nightmares during sleep, but also depression, self-mutilation, and other problems in waking life. Colic found that therapeutic conversations could reduce the distressing content of dreams, while understandings about life—and even characters—from lucid dreams could be applied to their lives with marked therapeutic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Colic, M. (2007). "Kanna's lucid dreams and the use of narrative practices to explore their meaning." ''The International Journal of Narrative Therapy and Community Work'' (4): 19–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychotherapists have applied lucid dreaming as a part of therapy. Studies have shown that by inducing a lucid dream recurrent nightmares can be alleviated. It is unclear whether this alleviation is due to lucidity or the ability to alter the dream itself. A 2006 study performed by Victor Spoormaker and Van den Bout evaluated the validity of lucid dreaming treatment (LDT) in chronic nightmare sufferers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spoormaker | first1 = V.I. | last2 = van den Bout | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Lucid dreaming treatment for nightmares: a pilot study | url = | journal = Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics | volume = 75 | issue = 6| pages = 389–94 | doi=10.1159/000095446 | pmid=17053341}}&lt;/ref&gt; LDT is composed of exposure, mastery and lucidity exercises. Results of lucid dreaming treatment revealed that the nightmare frequency of the treatment groups had decreased. In another study, Spoormaker, Van den Bout, and Meijer (2003) investigated lucid dreaming treatment for nightmares by testing eight subjects who received a one-hour individual session, which consisted of lucid dreaming exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spoormaker | first1 = V.I. | last2 = van den Bout | first2 = J. | last3 = Meijer | first3 = E.J.G. | year = 2003 | title = Lucid dreaming treatment for nightmares: a series of cases | url = | journal = Dreaming | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 181–86 | doi=10.1037/1053-0797.13.3.181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the study revealed that the nightmare frequency had decreased and the sleep quality had slightly increased.

Holzinger, Klösch, and Saletu managed a psychotherapy study under the working name of ‘Cognition during dreaming – a therapeutic intervention in nightmares’, which included 40 subjects, men and women, 18–50 years old, whose life quality was significantly altered by nightmares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://registration.akm.ch/einsicht.php|title=Holzinger, B., Klösch, G., &amp; Saletu, B. (2012). Cognition in Sleep - A Therapeutic Intervention in Patients with Nightmares and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. 21st Congress of the European Sleep Research Society, 1, Retrieved April 21, 2014|work=akm.ch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424074809/http://registration.akm.ch/einsicht.php|archivedate=April 24, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test subjects were administered Gestalt group therapy and 24 of them were also taught to enter the state of lucid dreaming by Holzinger. This was purposefully taught in order to change the course of their nightmares. The subjects then reported the diminishment of their nightmare prevalence from 2–3 times a week to 2–3 times per month.

===Creativity===
In her book ''[[The Committee of Sleep]]'', [[Deirdre Barrett]] describes how some experienced lucid dreamers have learned to remember specific practical goals such as artists looking for inspiration seeking a show of their own work once they become lucid or computer programmers looking for a screen with their desired code. However, most of these dreamers had many experiences of failing to recall waking objectives before gaining this level of control.&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;Barrett, Deirdre. ''The Committee of Sleep: How Artists, Scientists, and Athletes Use their Dreams for Creative Problem Solving ... and How You Can, Too''. Hardback Random House, 2001, Paperback Oneroi Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Some movies like ''[[Inception]]'' refer to the concept of lucid dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hiscock|first=John|title=''Inception'': Christopher Nolan interview|work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK|date=July 1, 2010|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/7866677/Inception-Christopher-Nolan-interview.html|accessdate=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As predicted by the theorem, the maximum of the modulus cannot be inside of the disk (so the highest value on the red surface is somewhere along its edge).]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''maximum modulus principle''' in [[complex analysis]] states that if ''f'' is a [[holomorphic function]], then the [[absolute value|modulus]] |''f'' | cannot exhibit a true [[local maximum]] that is properly within the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of ''f''. 

In other words, either ''f'' is a [[constant function]], or, for any point ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; inside the domain of ''f'' there exist other points arbitrarily close to ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; at which |''f'' | takes larger values.

==Formal statement==
Let ''f'' be a function holomorphic on some [[connected set|connected]] [[open set|open]] [[subset]] ''D'' of the [[complex plane]] ℂ and taking complex values. If ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a point in ''D'' such that 
:&lt;math&gt;|f(z_0)|\ge |f(z)|&lt;/math&gt; 
for all ''z'' in a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then the function ''f'' is constant on ''D''.

By switching to the [[Multiplicative_inverse|reciprocal]], we can get the '''minimum modulus principle'''. It states that if  ''f'' is holomorphic within a bounded domain ''D'', continuous up to the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of ''D'', and non-zero at all points, then |''f''(z)| takes its minimum value on the boundary of ''D''.

Alternatively, the maximum modulus principle can be viewed as a special case of the [[open mapping theorem (complex analysis)|open mapping theorem]], which states that a nonconstant holomorphic function maps open sets to open sets. If |''f''| attains a local maximum at ''z'', then the image of a sufficiently small open neighborhood of ''z'' cannot be open. Therefore, ''f'' is constant.

==Sketches of proofs==

===Using the maximum principle for harmonic functions===
One can use the equality

:&lt;math&gt;\log f(z) = \ln |f(z)| + i\arg f(z)&lt;/math&gt;

for complex [[natural logarithm]]s to deduce that ln |''f''(''z'')| is a [[harmonic function]]. Since ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a local maximum for this function also, it follows from the [[maximum principle]] that |''f''(''z'')| is constant. Then, using the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]] we show that ''{{prime|f}}''(''z'') = 0, and thus that ''f''(''z'') is constant as well. Similar reasoning shows that |''f''| can only have a local minimum (which necessarily has value 0) at an isolated zero of ''f(z)''.

===Using Gauss's mean value theorem===
Another proof works by using Gauss's mean value theorem to "force" all points within overlapping open disks to assume the same value. The disks are laid such that their centers form a polygonal path from the value where ''f''(''z'') is maximized to any other point in the domain, while being totally contained within the domain. Thus the existence of a maximum value implies that all the values in the domain are the same, thus ''f''(''z'') is constant.

==Physical interpretation==

A physical interpretation of this principle comes from the [[heat equation]]. That is, since log |''f''(''z'')| is harmonic, it is thus the steady state of a heat flow on the region ''D''. Suppose a strict maximum was attained on the interior of ''D'', the heat at this maximum would be dispersing to the points around it, which would contradict the assumption that this represents the steady state of a system.

== Applications ==
The maximum modulus principle has many uses in complex analysis, and may be used to prove the following:
* The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]].
* [[Schwarz's lemma]], a result which in turn has many generalisations and applications in complex analysis.
* The [[Phragmén–Lindelöf principle]], an extension to unbounded domains.
* The [[Borel–Carathéodory theorem]], which bounds an analytic function in terms of its real part.
* The [[Hadamard three-lines theorem]], a result about the behaviour of bounded holomorphic functions on a line between two other parallel lines in the complex plane.

The report '''Metal Stocks in Society: Scientific Synthesis'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/MetalStocks/tabid/56054/Default.aspx ''Metal Stocks in Society: Scientific synthesis''], 2010, [[International Resource Panel]], [[UNEP]]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first of six scientific assessments on global [[metal]]s to be published by the [[International Resource Panel]] (IRP) of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. The IRP provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of areas, including:
* the volume of selected [[raw material]] reserves and how efficiently these resources are being used
* the lifecycle-long environmental impacts of products and services created and consumed around the globe
* options to meet human and economic needs with fewer or cleaner resources.

==About the report==
Metals were an early priority for the [[International Resource Panel]], since little was known about them, their impacts, their economic importance or their scarcity. The report aimed to calculate the amount of metals present in society and assess the potential for utilising in-use stock to offset demand from virgin metal. Knowing how much metal stock there is in use, and how long the lifespan of the metal is, can help planners know when these metal stocks will enter recycling or waste streams.  It suggested that these 'mines above ground' had growing potential for future metals supply; the authors found that there is about 50&amp;nbsp;kg of above-ground [[copper]] for every person on earth, and more than two tons of [[iron]] per capita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2010/05/13/un-metals-idUKN1321607320100513 ''UN panel sees future shortage of specialty metals''] Patrick Worsnip, Reuters, 13 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they noted that enormous disparities in global metals stocks existed between developed and developing nations including Brazil, China and India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/2564826/Copper-all/UN-report-highlights-disparities-in-global-metals-stocks.html ''UN report highlights disparities in global metal stocks''], Metal Bulletin, 19 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculating ‘anthropogenic stocks’ of metals already in use in society is a precursor to stimulating efforts to increase [[recycling]]. The authors reported that very little information is presently known about different metals, making it difficult for policy makers to develop and plan recycling systems. However, what is known is that recycling can not only reduce negative impacts on the environment but also save energy. For example, 95% of the energy used to make [[aluminium]] from [[bauxite]] ore is saved by using recycled material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethicallivingblog/2008/feb/22/aluminiumsrubbishrecyclingr ''Aluminium’s rubbish recycling rate''], Carolyn Fry, Tread Lightly, The Guardian, 22 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors quantified per capita stocks of the following metals, for some countries (stocks were mostly quantified for developed countries but data was also available for some developing nations).
* ''Major engineering metals:'' aluminium, copper, iron, [[lead]], [[steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[zinc]]
* ''Precious metals:'' [[gold]], [[palladium]], [[platinum]], [[rhodium]], [[silver]]
* ''Specialty metals:'' [[antimony]], [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], [[cobalt]], [[magnesium]], [[manganese]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[molybdenum]], [[nickel]], [[tin]], [[titanium]], [[tungsten]]

==Reasons for recycling==
Some primary stocks of rare but useful metals are already running low. For example, [[rhenium]] only occurs at seven parts per billion in the Earth’s crust, making it one of the rarest elements on the planet. However, its high melting point of 3,186&amp;nbsp;°C makes it valuable in the manufacture of jet engines. Demand for the metal is rising, with increasing air travel, but its rarity means increasing extraction is not simple. This is where recycling comes in; rhenium is one of the few metals that has witnessed a rise in recycling rates. It is likely that recycling will become a more viable option than extraction for other metals in future, saving energy, cutting greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere and reducing negative impacts on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Babbage: Rare metals, Recycling [https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/05/rare_metals ‘’The Economist’’] 29 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18979">The '''Münster Diocesan Feud''' ({{lang-de|Münsterische Stiftsfehde}}), or simply '''Münster Feud''', was a dispute that took place between 1450 and 1457 over the appointment to the [[Bishopric of Münster|bishop's throne in Münster]], and hence the rule of the [[Diocese of Münster|diocese]]. The opposing candidates were [[Walram of Moers]] and [[Eric I of Hoya|Eric of Hoya]]. They were supported by their families with Count [[John V of Hoya|John of Hoya]] and Archbishop [[Dietrich II of Moers]] at their respective heads. In addition, there were also external allies. Within the diocese the ''[[Stände]]'', namely the [[cathedral chapter]] and the town of [[Münster (Westfalen)|Münster]], played an independent role at times. In the end neither candidate was able to succeed to the office.

== Background ==
[[File:Moers-Grafschaft.png|thumb|189px|Coat of arms of the counts of Moers]]
[[File:Hoya-wappen.png|thumb|189px|Coat of arms of the counts of Hoya]]
The Diocese of Münster was one of the largest and most important ecclesial territories in the northwest German area. In the [[Late Middle Ages]] the bishop's thrones in the region were predominantly filled by members of comital families or the families of hereditary [[noblemen]] (''Edelherren''). These families, like the [[County of Mark|counts of the Mark]], attempted to secure episcopal seats for their sons. Even less powerful families took the opportunity to increase their influence, at least occasionally, over an ecclesial territory. To this group belonged the [[House of Lippe|lords of Lippe]], who occupied the bishop's throne in [[Bishopric of Paderborn|Paderborn]] several times. The [[County of Hoya|counts of Hoya]] were successful in the [[Bishopric of Osnabrück]]. In the [[Bishopric of Minden]] this was true of the houses of [[County of Diepholz|Diepholz]] and [[Schaumburg-Lippe|Schaumburg]]. In the mid-15th century, however, the [[County of Moers|counts of Moers]] were foremost in this regard. Especially after [[Dietrich of Moers]] had become [[Archbishop of Cologne]], the family was able to secure the majority of the bishop's seats in the northwest German area. Their main rival in the Bishopric of Münster was the Hoya family.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internally, some of the [[prince-bishop]]s, most recently [[Otto IV of Hoya]], had expanded their territory and got rid of smaller internal lordships. By contrast it was clear that the bishops in the 13th and 14th centuries had largely lost control of their capital, Münster. The city acted independently almost as if it were a rich [[imperial immediacy|imperially immediate]] city. In addition, the ''[[Stände]]'', the [[cathedral chapter]], knights and towns had gained influence and sharply reduced the power of the bishops.

After the death of Bishop Otto IV, Dietrich of Moers succeeded in getting his brother, [[Henry II of Moers]], into the Münster bishopric against the will of the city of Münster. After the archbishop, due to internal diocesan disputes, had secured the Bishopric of Osnabrück for Erich of Hoya, he placed Henry there as administrator. He oriented his policy sharply towards his brother's interests and supported him strongly during the [[Feud of Soest]]. The House of Hoya, who also held the bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Verden|Verden]] and Minden, saw the counts of Moers as intruders in their own area of interest. Apart from the [[Archdiocese of Cologne]], Münster and Osnabrück, the House of Moers ruled Paderborn and parts of the [[Bishopric of Utrecht]]. The warlike stance of Henry in supporting his brother did not help the diocese, rather it resulted in a sharp increase in its debt and a decline in prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 171–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Start of the conflict ==
Within the diocese, the estates were in open revolt by Henry's death. From now on, the aspirations of the House of Moers ran into resistance. Despite that, Dietrich did everything possible to continue to occupy Münster with a member of his family. As a successor he had provided his brother Walram of Moers, but this brought him into conflict with the House of Hoya. John of Hoya had not forgotten that Dietrich of Moers was exchanged for members of his family. In particular, he had not forgotten his own six years imprisonment in connection with the fighting around Osnabrück. He wanted to make his brother, Erich of Hoya, successor.

In addition to the two main rivals for the episcopacy, there were other contenders. The town of Osnabrück strongly supported [[Conrad III of Diepholz|Conrad of Diepholz]]. He was the [[cathedral provost]] (''Dompropst'') in Osnabrück and a nephew of the Bishop of Utrecht, [[Rudolph of Diepholz]]. He supported the candidacy, but arrived too late to actively promote his nephew.

Dietrich of Moers gave away large bribes to win a majority in the cathedral chapter for his brother. He had, until recently been a supporter of the [[Council of Basel]], before he changed sides to the Roman [[curia]]. Dietrich succeeded in getting the majority of the cathedral chapter on side at a meeting in [[Hausdülmen]] on 15&amp;nbsp;July 1450. But John of Hoya campaigned for his brother, Erich. He won over the citizens of the city of Münster and the nobility to his cause. Within the city he was mainly supported by the guilds and the commoners, while the hereditary patricians on the council did not want confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

John of Hoya was elected by the secular estates as the diocesan administrator (''Stiftsverweser''). He was to officiate until the Pope had appointed a bishop acceptable to both citizens and lords. In a letter to the Pope they explained their reasons for this unusual procedure were that Walram was allegedly responsible for two murders as well as other crimes in the past. By contrast, Erich of Hoya had led a supposedly blameless life and had had an academic education. A minority of thirteen canons and all the clergy of the city supported this position. In Osnabrück, John of Hoya, succeeded his brother [[Albert of Hoya]] to become the administrator. Thus, the position of the family was further strengthened in the battle for the Diocese of Münster.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 176&lt;/ref&gt;

As administrator, John of Hoya brought most of Münster's [[royal castle]]s (''Landesburgen'') under his control. In order to reduce his own costs as far as possible, he seized the estates of the bishop and income of the [[cathedral canon]]s (''Domherren''). In addition, he introduced an [[excise duty]] on trade goods. The supporters of Walram in the cathedral chapter were prepared to negotiate in this eventuality. An agreement was reached that the Hoyas largely honoured, according to which at the next ''[[Landtag]]'' all the estates would appeal to the Pope to award the office of bishop to Erich of Hoya. In return the canons were guaranteed their former rights and income. The ''Landtag'' approved this arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 176–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann I von Kleve (1419-1481).jpg|thumb|John of Cleves was one of the most important supporters of the Hoya party.]]
In January 1451, John of Hoya captured [[Hausdülmen|Dülmen Castle]] which had opposed him. Meanwhile, in ignorance of the unanimous support of the estates for Hoya, Pope [[Pope Nicholas V]] had appointed Walram of Moers as bishop. The town of responded to this by asking for a legal opinion from the [[University of Erfurt]]. Their judgement was that the estates did not have to accept the decision of the Pope because the Pope would not have known of Walram's unsuitability for the post.&lt;ref name="Kohl_177"&gt;Kohl (1999), 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hoya family were also supported by the [[Duchy of Cleves]]. Duke [[John I of Cleves-Mark|John of Cleves]] hoped thereby to weaken the power of the Archbishop of Cologne. On 11&amp;nbsp;June 1451, the Treaty of Haus Dülmen was signed, sealing an alliance between Cleves and John of Hoya. As a reward for his support in the battle against Walram of Moers Cleves was given the estates of Dülmen and [[Stromberg Castle|Stromberg]]. Cleves was not just a valuable military ally. Also important was his advocacy through [[Philip III of Burgundy|Philip of Burgundy]], an uncle of the duke, in Rome. Following the signing of the treaty, Cleves declared war on Walram of Moers.&lt;ref name="Kohl_177"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the role of Burgundy see: ''Burgund und das Reich: Spätmittelalterliche Außenpolitik am Beispiel der Regierung Karls des Kühnen (1465–1477).'' Munich, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day news arrived in Münster that Emperor [[Frederick III (HRR)|Frederick III]] had conferred the [[regalia]] on Walram. After Walram had also received Papal confirmation, he removed several of his opponents from their high church offices and had the supporters of his opponent placed under a Papally-ordained [[interdict]]. Those affected appealed again to the University of Erfurt. The university judged the measures taken by Walram and the Archbishop of Cologne to be invalid. Philip of Burgundy intervened on behalf of the Hoya faction, writing a letter to Rome. Before taking any further steps, Rome decided to wait and see what position [[Nicholas of Cusa]] would take in this case.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outbreak of fighting == 
[[File:Nicholas of Cusa.jpg|thumb|Cusa failed in his attempt to prevent an outbreak of fighting on behalf of the Pope.]]
Meanwhile, in the diocese, the feud broke out in the form of smaller operations. Most of the [[Upper Diocese of Münster|upper diocese]] was subsequently dominated by the Hoya faction; Walram only possessed the area around [[Ahaus]], [[Vreden]] and [[Ottenstein (Ahaus)|Ottenstein]].

Nicholas of Cusa was probably expected to instruct the Pope to replace both the earlier episcopal candidates with Conrad of Diepholz. Nicholas of Cusa, however, expressed opposition to the Hoyas. With the fall of Vreden, Walram also lost his last town in the Diocese of Moers. He notified Cusa on 21 January 1452 of his willingness to renounce the bishopric, provided it was possible to remove keep the Hoyas out and to make Conrad of Diepholz bishop instead.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 178-179&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter was supported ''inter alia'' by his uncle, Bishop Rudolph of Utrecht. From now on the Hoyas encountered increasingly strong military action, for example at the Siege of Ahaus. At the start of 1452 a mercenary arm defeated Hoya and the Münster troops and took large numbers of prisoners. On 2&amp;nbsp;February the supporters of Diepholz declared a feud against their opponents. Walram pledged the latter the remaining settlements he owned - Ahaus and Ottenstein - to Rudolph of Utrecht. In the diocese itself, sympathy grew for Conrad of Diepholz, whose candidature appeared to be an increasingly attractive alternative to the former aspirants. The estates sought therefore, on 6&amp;nbsp;October 1452 in [[Coesfeld]], to reach a compromise, in order to get rid of both Walram of Moers and Erich of Hoya. All episcopal decisions since the death of Bishop Henry were declared null and void. In any case, these peace attempts failed. One reason was probably that John of Cleves continued to support Erich of Hoya.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

John of Hoya, who had previously left the town, returned to Münster. Supported by the lower levels of the town of Münster, John of Hoya transferred the diocesan regency in 1453 ''de jure'' to his brother Erich, so that the latter could prove himself as regent. Although the mayors of the towns opposed this, they eventually had to accept it under pressure from their townsfolk. Erich of Hoya was thereupon rendered homage in all the towns.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spread of the conflict ==
This pitched the conflict into a new phase. Rudolph of Utrecht declared a feud against the town of Münster and its three allies on 7&amp;nbsp;July 1453. He succeeded in capturing the town of Vreden which, shortly thereafter was retaken by John of Hoya. Rudolph of Utrecht took advantage of disputes in the enemy camp and took a number of towns. Against the background of the triumphant advance of his opponent, in 1454 John of Hoya forced the re-election of the town council in Münster which was sympathetic to his cause. The majority of the council came from the guilds and the common people, only a few hereditary patricians (''Erbmänner'') were represented. In Münster resistance to the harsh rule of the Hoyas started to increase. Moreover, in October 1454, the [[Hansetag]] demanded the restoration of the old council constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The allies around Walram of Moers and the Bishop of Utrecht managed to obtain assurances from the Pope, that all complaints from the opposite side to the Pope about spiritual penalties imposed by Walram were invalid. Those who aligned themselves with Walram were assured that they would receive absolution from any excommunication. Coesfeld was the first town to take advantage of the offer. This became the Walram's residence.

Because John of Cleves was temporarily unable to provide support due to his wedding, John of Hoya turned to Duke [[Frederick II of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Frederick of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] with a request for assistance. With his help John of Hoya attacked, plundering and destroying, the area of Coesfeld and the [[County of Bentheim]], which supported his enemies. Walram and Dietrich initially lacked the means to defend themselves against it. In July, a body of troops belonging to the archbishop arrived in Dülmen. Through a tactical mistake by Count John of Hoya, Duke Frederick's troops were alone when an allied army led by Dietrich of Moers, Walram of Moers, Rudolph of Utrecht, Bernard II of Bentheim, [[Bernard VII of Lippe|Bernard of Lippe]] and Conrad of Diepholz attacked and inflicted a crushing defeat on their opponents in the Battle of Varlar. The Duke was captured. One more vigorous attack might have brought total success, but the allies were hampered by internal disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minor war and more negotiations ==
John of Hoya noticed that the mood in Münster was turning against him. He offered to transfer all the towns and castles to Cleves. But John of Cleves now had other plans. He wanted to give the diocese to Simon of Lippe, while Eric of Hoya was to get the Diocese of Osnabrück. He thus hoped that this would help to expel Bishop Rudolph from Utrecht. A short time later the latter died after he had ceded his rights to Ahaus and Ottenstein to Conrad of Diepholz. With his death, the allies of the House of Moers and Conrad of Diepholz lost their strongest supporter. The latter became Bishop of Osnabrück, but did not give up his aim of becoming the bishop in Münster as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Diocese of Münster, Walram of Moers continued to be opposed by John of Hoya. However, Dietrich of Moers did not pursue the matter with any great effort. So the fighting continued in the form of a minor war. In addition, negotiations took place which led to no result. One major success in early 1456 was the conquest of Coesfeld by John of Hoya. Then, in October 1456, Walram of Moers died in Arnhem. John of Hoya now relied on the support of the Duke of Burgundy. On behalf of Eric of Hoya he appealed for support to [[Pope Callistus III]], who was hoping that Burgundy would help him win the [[Ottoman Wars]]. The strong support of Philip of Burgundy for Hoya's cause meant that the towns now aligned themselves more firmly on the side of John of Hoya than they had in recent years. Eric of Hoya was proposed as bishop by two of the canons. However, the majority of the canons chose Conrad of Diepholz. Both sides asked Rome for a decision.

John of Hoya sought to strengthen his position in Münster by obtained citizenship in early 1457 and joining the Blacksmiths' Guild. A short time later he was elected to the Council. However, the Pope decided upon [[John of Palatinate-Simmern]], who had been totally uninvolved in the previous disputes. John of Hoya looked in vain to the support of Cleves and Burgundy once more. But even Conrad of Diepholz's aspiration to maintain his position failed.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcome and aftermath ==
On 23 October 1457 the Treaty of Kranenburg was signed that ended the conflict. It stipulated that Eric of Hoya should receive a lifetime income equivalent to that of the Cologne provost office. The city of Münster undertook to recognize the new bishop, to allow him to enter the town and to pay homage to him. In return, the new bishop agreed to recognize the existing privileges of the town. The new bishop also recognized the enfeoffment of the estates of Dülmen and Stromberg to the Duke of Cleves. The latter also received compensation of 11,000 Rhenish guilders. In early November, the new bishop arrived in Münster, swore the oath of office and the [[electoral capitulation]].

Earlier, John of Hoya had secretly left the town. Eric of Hoya died in 1458. [[Bevergern Castle]] which had been enfeoffed to him was returned to the diocese. After the peace treaty, life in the diocese quickly returned to normal. The dominant position that the patrician's (''Erbmänner'') had long held on Münster's town council was broken, as the guilds secured the right to be represented by their members. The ''Erbmänner'' only had half of the Council. In the end it was clear that the diocese had just become an object in the power game between noble families. The Emperor and Pope had lost any real influence. In the era of Henry and Walrams of Moers, some of the bishops had virtually lost any sense of their calling in faith to serve God and neighbour, but were simply out for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4795">'''Narrative logic''' describes any [[logic]]al process of [[narratology|narrative analysis]] used by readers or viewers to understand and draw conclusions from narratives. Narrative logic is a tool through which the audience may infer actions, events, intentions, thoughts, beliefs, values, and feelings of characters and narrators, or otherwise elucidate details not included in the narrative.  For example, if a character is in Paris in one scene and in Nice the next, the audience can infer that she traveled, and later references to that travel will not be illogical or unexplainable simply because the trip was not explicitly described. In the same way, if a gun is shown in the drawer of a character's desk, the audience can infer that the gun will be or has been used in some way relevant to the plot.  Authors will often play with conventional patterns of narrative logic by attempting to plant "false leads" or to hide important clues, leading audiences to improper conclusions or even to doubt their sense of what is really happening.

It is necessary to build a [[logical argument]] based upon the content of a narrative, using its events and [[rhetoric]] as evidence to infer other elements necessary to produce a coherent and consistent plot, theme, and argument. This is done to ensure that one's argument does not contradict or alter the narrative itself. Problems and disagreements may arise from this fixity of the narrative because it should also preclude alteration of the artistic statement being conveyed, something that is open to subjective interpretation and may be paradoxical or illogical in itself. Thus, this process is generally imperfect since, as with all narrative analysis and most forms of logic, different applications and interpretations can lead to differing conclusions.

Narrative logic becomes explicit or even labored to create [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] where there is a [[plot hole]] or some intentional gap in a narrative, or to explain other unresolved issues within a narrative (i.e. questions such as "Did this character die or simply disappear?" or "Why did two instances under the same circumstances lead to different results?"). It may also be used for other purposes, such as answering theoretical questions derived from the narrative (i.e. "What would happen if...?" or "Who would win in a battle between...?"). In a broader sense it is used in devices such as [[fictional character|character]] development, since a character is defined by the interpretations of its actions and the rhetoric used to describe it.

==Example: Kill Bill: Volume 2==
:

Consider the question of what happens to the character of Elle Driver ([[Daryl Hannah]]) in this movie. At the end of the movie a shot is shown of each of the characters on the Bride's kill list with a caption telling the fate of the character. For Elle Driver the caption reads "???," director [[Quentin Tarantino]] seemingly leaving it up to the audience to decide. Using narrative logic, we take all relevant information from the narrative and come to a conclusion about Driver's fate. Driver is last depicted thrashing about in a trailer, having been blinded by the Bride. This trailer is also occupied by a deadly [[black mamba]], a fact that is emphasized when it is shown poised to strike as the Bride leaves the trailer. Logically, a thrashing, blind woman and threatened snake occupying a confined space would lead most to conclude that Driver falls prey to the snake and is dead at the end of the film. This conclusion may be further supported by taking into consideration the film's rhetorical and artistic devices. The film is largely a tale of deadly vengeance, and the other targets of the Bride are known to be dead at the film's end, thus the ending is better rounded by assuming Driver to likewise be dead. Also, the Bride's codename is Black Mamba, and this same snake killed another of the Bride's targets, so if one presumes the snake is a rhetorical extension of the Bride's wrath, it would most likely strike Driver down while she is vulnerable.
 
However, one may also argue that Driver survived. Again, this conclusion can be supported with logic and analysis of the movie's narrative. The strongest evidence may be the very fact that Driver's fate is left open to question. Another point is that, despite blindness, Driver is still a highly trained professional who would not easily succumb to death by a small reptile.

This example shows how the application of narrative logic may lead to different conclusions using the same evidence. However, these conclusions are similar in that they do not detract from the narrative itself, but only build upon it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33020">'''Photon polarization''' is the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] description of the [[Classical physics|classical]] [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] [[sinusoidal]] [[plane wave|plane]] [[electromagnetic wave]]. An individual [[photon]]
can be described as having right or left [[circular polarization]], or a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of the two. Equivalently, a photon can be described as having horizontal or vertical [[linear polarization]], or a superposition of the two.

The description of photon polarization contains many of the physical concepts and much of the mathematical machinery of more involved quantum descriptions, such as the quantum mechanics of an electron in a potential well. Polarization is an example of a [[qubit]] degree of freedom, which forms a fundamental basis for an understanding of more complicated quantum phenomena. Much of the mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics, such as [[Quantum state|state vectors]], [[probability amplitude]]s, [[unitary operator]]s, and [[Hermitian operator]]s, emerge naturally from the classical [[Maxwell's equations]] in the description. The quantum polarization state vector for the photon, for instance, is identical with the [[Jones vector]], usually used to describe the polarization of a classical [[wave]]. Unitary operators emerge from the classical requirement of the [[conservation of energy]] of a classical wave propagating through lossless media that alter the polarization state of the wave. Hermitian operators then follow for infinitesimal transformations of a classical polarization state.

Many of the implications of the mathematical machinery are easily verified experimentally. In fact, many of the experiments can be performed with two pairs (or one broken pair) of [[Polaroid (polarizer)|polaroid]] sunglasses.

The connection with quantum mechanics is made through the identification of a minimum packet size, called a [[photon]], for energy in the electromagnetic field. The identification is based on the theories of [[Max Planck|Planck]] and the interpretation of those theories by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]. The [[correspondence principle]] then allows the identification of momentum and angular momentum (called [[Spin (physics)|spin]]), as well as energy, with the photon.

==Polarization of classical electromagnetic waves==

{{Main|Polarization (waves)}}
{{duplication|section=yes|dupe=Sinusoidal plane-wave solutions of the electromagnetic wave equation|date=July 2014}}

===Polarization states===

====Linear polarization====

{{Main|Linear polarization}}

[[Image:Mudflats-polariser.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Effect of a polarizer on reflection from mud flats. In the first picture, the polarizer is rotated to minimize the effect; in the second it is rotated 90° to maximize it: almost all reflected sunlight is eliminated.]]

The wave is linearly polarized (or plane polarized) when the phase angles
&lt;math&gt; \alpha_x^{ } , \alpha_y &lt;/math&gt; are [[Polarization (waves)#Polarization state|equal]],

:&lt;math&gt;    \alpha_x =  \alpha_y \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\    \alpha.  &lt;/math&gt;

This represents a wave with [[phase (waves)|phase]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; polarized at an angle &lt;math&gt; \theta    &lt;/math&gt; with respect to the x axis. In that case the Jones vector can be written

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle  =   \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta    \\ \sin\theta   \end{pmatrix} \exp \left ( i \alpha \right )   .&lt;/math&gt;

The state vectors for linear polarization in x or y are special cases of this state vector.

If unit vectors are defined such that

:&lt;math&gt;   |x\rangle  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\     \begin{pmatrix} 1    \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}    &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;   |y\rangle  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\     \begin{pmatrix} 0    \\ 1  \end{pmatrix}    &lt;/math&gt;

then the linearly polarized polarization state can be written in the "x-y basis" as

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle  =  \cos\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha \right ) |x\rangle + \sin\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha \right ) |y\rangle = \psi_x |x\rangle + \psi_y |y\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

====Circular polarization====
{{Main|Circular polarization}}
If the phase angles &lt;math&gt;\alpha_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_y&lt;/math&gt; differ by exactly &lt;math&gt;\pi / 2&lt;/math&gt; and the x amplitude equals the y amplitude the wave is [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]]. The Jones vector then becomes

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle  =   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \pm i  \end{pmatrix} \exp \left ( i \alpha_x \right )   &lt;/math&gt;

where the plus sign indicates right circular polarization and the minus sign indicates left circular polarization. In the case of circular polarization, the electric field vector of constant magnitude rotates in the x-y plane.

If unit vectors are defined such that

:&lt;math&gt;   |R\rangle  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\    {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1    \\ i  \end{pmatrix}    &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;   |L\rangle  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\    {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1    \\ -i  \end{pmatrix}    &lt;/math&gt;

then an arbitrary polarization state can be written in the "R-L basis" as

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle   = \psi_R |R\rangle + \psi_L |L\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_R = \langle R|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\cos\theta\exp(i\alpha_x) - i\sin\theta\exp(i\alpha_y))&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_L = \langle L|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\cos\theta\exp(i\alpha_x) + i\sin\theta\exp(i\alpha_y)).&lt;/math&gt;

We can see that

:&lt;math&gt; 1 = |\psi_R|^2 + |\psi_L|^2 .  &lt;/math&gt;

====Elliptical polarization====

{{Main|Elliptical polarization}}

The general case in which the electric field rotates in the x-y plane and has variable magnitude is called [[elliptical polarization]]. The state vector is given by

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \begin{pmatrix} \psi_x  \\ \psi_y   \end{pmatrix} =   \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha_x \right )   \\ \sin\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha_y \right )   \end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

====Geometric visualization of an arbitrary polarization state====
To get an understanding of what a polarization state looks like, one can observe the orbit that is made if the polarization state is multiplied by a phase factor of &lt;math&gt;e^{i\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; and then having the real parts of its components interpreted as x and y coordinates respectively. That is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\Re(e^{i\omega t}\psi_x)\\ \Re(e^{i\omega t}\psi_y)\end{pmatrix} = \Re\left[e^{i\omega t}\begin{pmatrix}\psi_x\\ \psi_y\end{pmatrix}\right] = \Re\left(e^{i\omega t}|\psi\rangle\right).&lt;/math&gt;

If only the traced out shape and the direction of the rotation of {{math|(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;), &lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;))}} is considered when interpreting the polarization state, i.e. only

:&lt;math&gt;M(|\psi\rangle) = \left.\left\{\Big( x(t),\,y(t) \Big)\,\right|\,\forall\,t \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

(where {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;)}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;)}} are defined as above) and whether it is overall more right circularly or left circularly polarized (i.e. whether {{math|{{!}}&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;{{!}} &gt; {{!}}&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;{{!}}}} or vice versa), it can be seen that the physical interpretation will be the same even if the state is multiplied by an arbitrary phase factor, since

:&lt;math&gt;M(e^{i\alpha}|\psi\rangle) = M(|\psi\rangle),\ \alpha\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

and the direction of rotation will remain the same. In other words, there is no physical difference between two polarization states &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha}|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, between which only a phase factor differs.

It can be seen that for a linearly polarized state, &lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt; will be a line in the xy plane, with length 2 and its middle in the origin, and whose slope equals to {{math|tan(&lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt;)}}. For a circularly polarized state, &lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt; will be a circle with radius {{math|1/{{sqrt|2}}}} and with the middle in the origin.

==Energy, momentum, and angular momentum of a classical electromagnetic wave==

===Energy density of classical electromagnetic waves===

====Energy in a plane wave====

{{Main|Energy density}}

The [[Energy density|energy per unit volume]] in classical electromagnetic fields is (cgs units) and also Planck unit

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}_c = \frac{1}{8\pi} \left [ \mathbf{E}^2( \mathbf{r} , t ) + \mathbf{B}^2( \mathbf{r} , t ) \right ] .&lt;/math&gt;

For a plane wave, this becomes

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}_c = \frac{\mid \mathbf{E} \mid^2}{8\pi}    &lt;/math&gt;

where the energy has been averaged over a wavelength of the wave.

====Fraction of energy in each component====

The fraction of energy in the x component of the plane wave is

:&lt;math&gt; f_x = \frac{ \mid \mathbf{E} \mid^2 \cos^2\theta }{ \mid \mathbf{E} \mid^2 } = \psi_x^*\psi_x = \cos^2 \theta &lt;/math&gt;

with a similar expression for the y component resulting in &lt;math&gt;f_y=\sin^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

The fraction in both components is

:&lt;math&gt; \psi_x^*\psi_x + \psi_y^*\psi_y = \langle \psi  | \psi\rangle = 1.  &lt;/math&gt;

===Momentum density of classical electromagnetic waves===

The momentum density is given by the [[Poynting vector]]

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol { \mathcal{P}} = {1 \over 4\pi c } \mathbf{E}( \mathbf{r}, t ) \times \mathbf{B}( \mathbf{r}, t ).  &lt;/math&gt;

For a sinusoidal plane wave traveling in the z direction, the momentum is in the z direction and is related to the energy density:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}_z c = \mathcal{E}_c.  &lt;/math&gt;

The momentum density has been averaged over a wavelength.

===Angular momentum density of classical electromagnetic waves===

Electromagnetic waves can have both [[Light orbital angular momentum|orbital]] and [[Light spin angular momentum|spin]] angular momentum.&lt;ref name= "Orbital"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Allen, L. |author2=Beijersbergen, M.W. |author3=Spreeuw, R.J.C. |author4=Woerdman, J.P. |title=Orbital angular momentum of light and the transformation of Laguerre-Gaussian laser modes |journal=Physical Review A |volume=45 |issue=11 |pages=8186–9 |date=June 1992 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.45.8185 |url=http://pra.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v45/i11/p8185_1 |pmid=9906912|bibcode = 1992PhRvA..45.8185A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total angular momentum density is{{dubious|date=June 2016}}

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol { \mathcal{L} } = \mathbf{r} \times \boldsymbol { \mathcal{P} } = {1 \over 4\pi c } \mathbf{r} \times \left [ \mathbf{E}( \mathbf{r}, t ) \times \mathbf{B}( \mathbf{r}, t ) \right ]. &lt;/math&gt;

For a sinusoidal plane wave propagating along &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis the orbital angular momentum density vanishes. The spin angular momentum density is in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction and is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} = { {\mid \mathbf{E} \mid^2}  \over {8\pi\omega} } \left ( \mid \langle R  | \psi\rangle \mid^2 - \mid \langle L  | \psi\rangle \mid^2 \right ) = { 1  \over \omega } \mathcal{E}_c \left ( \mid \psi_R \mid^2 - \mid \psi_L \mid^2 \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where again the density is averaged over a wavelength.

==Optical filters and crystals==

===Passage of a classical wave through a polaroid filter===

[[Image:060815 polaroid.svg|250px|thumb|right|Linear polarization]]

A [[linear filter]] transmits one component of a plane wave and absorbs the perpendicular component. In that case, if the filter is polarized in the x direction, the fraction of energy passing through the filter is

:&lt;math&gt; f_x  = \psi_x^*\psi_x = \cos^2\theta.\,   &lt;/math&gt;

===Example of energy conservation: Passage of a classical wave through a birefringent crystal===

An ideal [[Birefringence|birefringent]] crystal transforms the polarization state of an electromagnetic wave without loss of wave energy. Birefringent crystals therefore provide an ideal test bed for examining the conservative transformation of polarization states. Even though this treatment is still purely classical, standard quantum tools such as unitary and Hermitian operators that evolve the state in time naturally emerge.

====Initial and final states====

A birefringent crystal is a material that has an '''optic axis''' with the property that the light has a different [[index of refraction]] for light polarized parallel to the axis than it has for light polarized perpendicular to the axis. Light polarized parallel to the axis are called "''extraordinary rays''" or "''extraordinary photons''", while light polarized perpendicular to the axis are called "''ordinary rays''" or "''ordinary photons''". If a linearly polarized wave impinges on the crystal, the extraordinary component of the wave will emerge from the crystal with a different phase than the ordinary component. In mathematical language, if the incident wave is linearly polarized at an angle &lt;math&gt; \theta  &lt;/math&gt; with respect to the optic axis, the incident state vector can be written

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle   =   \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta    \\ \sin\theta    \end{pmatrix}   &lt;/math&gt;

and the state vector for the emerging wave can be written

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi '\rangle   =   \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha_x \right )   \\ \sin\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha_y \right )   \end{pmatrix}  = \begin{pmatrix}  \exp \left ( i \alpha_x \right ) &amp; 0   \\ 0 &amp;  \exp \left ( i \alpha_y \right )   \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta    \\ \sin\theta    \end{pmatrix} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \hat{U} |\psi\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

While the initial state was linearly polarized, the final state is elliptically polarized. The birefringent crystal alters the character of the polarization.

====Dual of the final state====

[[Image:Calcite.jpg|right|thumb|400px|A calcite crystal laid upon a paper with some letters showing the double refraction]]

The initial polarization state is transformed into the final state with the [[Operator (physics)|operator]] U. The dual of the final state is given by

:&lt;math&gt;   \langle \psi '|   =  \langle \psi | \hat{U}^{\dagger} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;   U^{\dagger} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hermitian adjoint|adjoint]] of U, the complex conjugate transpose of the matrix.

====Unitary operators and energy conservation====

The fraction of energy that emerges from the crystal is

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\psi '| \psi '\rangle  = \langle\psi |\hat{U}^{\dagger}\hat{U}|\psi\rangle = \langle \psi|\psi\rangle = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

In this ideal case, all the energy impinging on the crystal emerges from the crystal. An operator U with the property that

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{U}^{\dagger}\hat{U} = I,&lt;/math&gt;

where I is the [[identity function|identity operator]] and U is called a [[unitary operator]]. The unitary property is necessary to ensure [[energy conservation]] in state transformations.

====Hermitian operators and energy conservation====

[[Image:Calcite-HUGE.jpg|thumb|right|Doubly refracting Calcite from Iceberg claim, Dixon, New Mexico. This 35 pound (16&amp;nbsp;kg) crystal, on display at the [[National Museum of Natural History]], is one of the largest single crystals in the United States.]]

If the crystal is very thin, the final state will be only slightly different from the initial state. The unitary operator will be close to the identity operator. We can define the operator H by

:&lt;math&gt;     \hat{U}  \approx I + i\hat{H} &lt;/math&gt;

and the adjoint by

:&lt;math&gt;     \hat{U}^{\dagger}  \approx I - i\hat{H}^{\dagger}. &lt;/math&gt;

Energy conservation then requires

:&lt;math&gt;   I =  \hat{U}^{\dagger} \hat{U} \approx \left ( I - i\hat{H}^{\dagger} \right ) \left ( I + i\hat{H} \right ) \approx I - i\hat{H}^{\dagger} + i\hat{H}. &lt;/math&gt;

This requires that

:&lt;math&gt;     \hat{H} = \hat{H}^{\dagger}. &lt;/math&gt;

Operators like this that are equal to their adjoints are called [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian]] or self-adjoint.

The infinitesimal transition of the polarization state is

:&lt;math&gt; |\psi ' \rangle  - |\psi\rangle   =   i\hat{H} |\psi\rangle.   &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, energy conservation requires that infinitesimal transformations of a polarization state occur through the action of a Hermitian operator.

==Photons: The connection to quantum mechanics==

{{Main|Photon}}

===Energy, momentum, and angular momentum of photons===

====Energy====

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Max-Planck-und-Albert-Einstein.jpg|thumb|Max Planck presents [[Albert Einstein]] with the Max Planck medal, Berlin June 28, 1929]] --&gt;

The treatment to this point has been [[Classical physics|classical]]. It is a testament, however, to the generality of [[Maxwell's equations]] for electrodynamics that the treatment can be made [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] with only a reinterpretation of classical quantities. The reinterpretation is based on the theories of [[Max Planck]] and the interpretation by [[Albert Einstein]] of those theories and of other experiments.

Einstein's conclusion from early experiments on the [[photoelectric effect]] is that electromagnetic radiation is composed of irreducible packets of energy, known as [[photon]]s. The energy of each packet is related to the angular frequency of the wave by the relation

:&lt;math&gt;    \epsilon = \hbar \omega &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;   \hbar  &lt;/math&gt; is an experimentally determined quantity known as [[Planck's constant]]. If there are &lt;math&gt;    N  &lt;/math&gt; photons in a box of volume &lt;math&gt;   V &lt;/math&gt;, the energy in the electromagnetic field is

:&lt;math&gt;    N \hbar \omega &lt;/math&gt;

and the energy density is

:&lt;math&gt;    {N \hbar \omega \over V} &lt;/math&gt;

The [[photon energy]] can be related to classical fields through the [[correspondence principle]] which states that for a large number of photons, the quantum and classical treatments must agree. Thus, for very large &lt;math&gt;    N  &lt;/math&gt;, the quantum energy density must be the same as the classical energy density

:&lt;math&gt;    {N \hbar \omega \over V} = \mathcal{E}_c = \frac{\mid \mathbf{E} \mid^2}{8\pi}.  &lt;/math&gt;

The number of photons in the box is then

:&lt;math&gt;    N  = \frac{V }{8\pi \hbar \omega}\mid  \mathbf{E} \mid^2 .  &lt;/math&gt;

====Momentum====

The correspondence principle also determines the momentum and angular momentum of the photon. For momentum

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathcal{P}_z =  {N \hbar \omega \over cV} = {N \hbar k_z \over V}   &lt;/math&gt;

where kz is the wave number. This implies that the momentum of a photon is

:&lt;math&gt;  p_z=\hbar k_z .\,   &lt;/math&gt;

====Angular momentum and spin====

Similarly for the spin angular momentum

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}  = { 1  \over \omega } \mathcal{E}_c \left ( \mid \psi_R \mid^2 - \mid \psi_L \mid^2 \right ) = { N\hbar  \over V }  \left ( \mid \psi_R \mid^2 - \mid \psi_L \mid^2 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where Ec is field strength. This implies that the spin angular momentum of the photon is

:&lt;math&gt; l_z = \hbar  \left ( \mid \psi_R \mid^2 - \mid \psi_L \mid^2 \right ). &lt;/math&gt;

the quantum interpretation of this expression is that the photon has a probability of &lt;math&gt;  \mid \psi_R \mid^2  &lt;/math&gt; of having a spin angular momentum of &lt;math&gt; \hbar  &lt;/math&gt; and a probability of &lt;math&gt;  \mid \psi_L \mid^2  &lt;/math&gt; of having a spin angular momentum of &lt;math&gt; -\hbar  &lt;/math&gt;. We can therefore think of the spin angular momentum of the photon being quantized as well as the energy. The angular momentum of classical light has been verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beth, R.A. |title=Direct detection of the angular momentum of light |journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=48 |issue=5 |page=471 |date=1935 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.471 |url=http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v48/i5/p471_1|bibcode = 1935PhRv...48..471B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Photons have only been observed to have spin angular momenta of &lt;math&gt; \pm \hbar &lt;/math&gt;.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no reference to an actual expermiment which measures this, and not just the classical angular momentum|date=January 2013}}

=====Spin operator=====

The [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of the photon is defined as the coefficient of &lt;math&gt; \hbar  &lt;/math&gt; in the spin angular momentum calculation. A photon has spin 1 if it is in the &lt;math&gt; | R \rangle  &lt;/math&gt; state and -1 if it is in the &lt;math&gt; | L \rangle  &lt;/math&gt; state. The spin operator is defined as the [[outer product]]

:&lt;math&gt;  \hat{S} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   |R\rangle \langle R | - |L\rangle \langle L |   =   \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -i    \\ i &amp; 0  \end{pmatrix}.    &lt;/math&gt;

The [[eigenvector]]s of the spin operator are &lt;math&gt;   |R\rangle     &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; |L\rangle     &lt;/math&gt; with [[eigenvalue]]s 1 and -1, respectively.

The expected value of a spin measurement on a photon is then

:&lt;math&gt;     \langle \psi |\hat{S} |\psi\rangle  = \mid \psi_R \mid^2 - \mid \psi_L \mid^2.   &lt;/math&gt;

An operator S has been associated with an observable quantity, the spin angular momentum. The eigenvalues of the operator are the allowed observable values. This has been demonstrated for spin angular momentum, but it is in general true for any observable quantity.

=====Spin states=====
{{see also|Circular polarization#Quantum mechanics}}

We can write the circularly polarized states as

:&lt;math&gt;     |s\rangle   &lt;/math&gt;

where s=1 for &lt;math&gt;     |R\rangle    &lt;/math&gt; and s= -1 for &lt;math&gt;     |L\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. An arbitrary state can be written{{clarify|reason=What is θ here? Also, what are x and α_x?|date=June 2015}}

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle   = \sum_{s=-1,1} a_s   \exp \left ( i \alpha_x -i s \theta \right ) |s\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;     \sum_{s=-1,1} \mid a_s \mid^2=1.    &lt;/math&gt;

=====Spin and angular momentum operators in differential form=====

When the state is written in spin notation, the spin operator can be written{{clarify|reason=Has the state space become a function space all of a sudden, with θ serving as the independent variable? I thought the state space was C^2. The sudden appearance of a differential operator without a space to use it on appears to be bleed-through from another model out there in the quantum ether somewhere.|date=June 2015}}

:&lt;math&gt;   \hat{S}_d  \rightarrow i { \partial \over \partial \theta}    &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;   \hat{S}_d^{\dagger}  \rightarrow -i { \partial \over \partial \theta}.    &lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvectors of the differential spin operator are

:&lt;math&gt;     \exp \left ( i \alpha_x -i s \theta \right ) |s\rangle.  &lt;/math&gt;

To see this note

:&lt;math&gt;   \hat{S}_d      \exp \left ( i \alpha_x -i s \theta \right ) |s\rangle   \rightarrow i { \partial \over \partial \theta}  \exp \left ( i \alpha_x -i s \theta \right ) |s\rangle = s \left [ \exp \left ( i \alpha_x -i s \theta \right ) |s\rangle \right ]. &lt;/math&gt;

The spin angular momentum operator is

:&lt;math&gt;   \hat{l}_z = \hbar \hat{S}_d.   &lt;/math&gt;

===The nature of probability in quantum mechanics===

====Probability for a single photon====
There are two ways in which probability can be applied to the behavior of photons; probability can be used to calculate the probable number of photons in a particular state, or probability can be used to calculate the likelihood of a single photon to be in a particular state. The former interpretation violates energy conservation{{cn|date=August 2016}}. The latter interpretation is the viable, if nonintuitive, option. Dirac explains this in the context of the [[double-slit experiment]]:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some time before the discovery of quantum mechanics people realized that the connection between light waves and photons must be of a statistical character. What they did not clearly realize, however, was that the wave function gives information about the probability of '''one''' photon being in a particular place and not the probable number of photons in that place{{dubious|reason=Dirac was probably wrong; he was overgeneralizing from fermions where there can only be 0 or 1. And at visible wavelengths and reasonable temperatures you rarely have more than one photon in a state. With lasers (or at radio frequencies, which Dirac wasn't thinking about) you can have very high occupation numbers whose expected value corresponds to the classical energy in that mode divided by hν.|date=August 2016}}. The importance of the distinction can be made clear in the following way. Suppose we have a beam of light consisting of a large number of photons split up into two components of equal intensity. On the assumption that the beam is connected with the probable number of photons in it, we should have half the total number going into each component. If the two components are now made to interfere, we should require a photon in one component to be able to interfere with one in the other. Sometimes these two photons would have to annihilate one another and other times they would have to produce four photons. This would contradict the conservation of energy. The new theory, which connects the wave function with probabilities for one photon gets over the difficulty by making each photon go partly into each of the two components. Each photon then interferes only with itself. Interference between two different photons never occurs{{dubious|reason=Dirac was just wrong -- or actually what he should have said is that interference measured in one mode is not due to energy in modes orthogonal with it. I have plenty of experience interfering waves from two different lasers for instance. Also, I would argue that photons don't even interfere with themselves; waves interfere.|date=August 2016}}.&lt;br&gt;&amp;mdash;Paul Dirac, '''The Principles of Quantum Mechanics,''' Fourth Edition, Chapter 1&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Probability amplitudes====
The probability for a photon to be in a particular polarization state depends on the fields as calculated by the classical Maxwell's equations. The polarization state of the photon is proportional to the field. The probability itself is quadratic in the fields and consequently is also quadratic in the quantum state of polarization. In quantum mechanics, therefore, the state or [[probability amplitude]] contains the basic probability information. In general, the rules for combining probability amplitudes look very much like the classical rules for composition of probabilities: [The following quote is from Baym, Chapter 1]{{clarify|reason=These rules are expressed much too loosely. What are "two successive probabilities" in scientific terms? What sort of statements, states, or sets of inequalities qualify as "possibilities"? What is a "way"? There seem to be a lot of unstated heuristics at work here, and the reader is left with the impression that QM is a collection of rules-of-thumb that have not been formalized.|date=June 2015}}

:&lt;blockquote&gt;
# The probability amplitude for two successive probabilities is the product of amplitudes for the individual possibilities. For example, the amplitude for the x polarized photon to be right circularly polarized '''and''' for the right circularly polarized photon to pass through the y-polaroid is &lt;math&gt;\langle R|x\rangle\langle y|R\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; the product of the individual amplitudes.
# The amplitude for a process that can take place in one of several '''indistinguishable''' ways is the sum of amplitudes for each of the individual ways. For example, the total amplitude for the x polarized photon to pass through the y-polaroid is the sum of the amplitudes for it to pass as a right circularly polarized photon, &lt;math&gt;\langle y|R\rangle\langle R|x\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; plus the amplitude for it to pass as a left circularly polarized photon, &lt;math&gt;\langle y|L\rangle\langle L|x\rangle\dots&lt;/math&gt;
# The total probability for the process to occur is the absolute value squared of the total amplitude calculated by 1 and 2.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Uncertainty principle===

[[Image:Cauchy schwarz inequality.svg|right|thumb|400px|Cauchy–Schwarz inequality in Euclidean space. &lt;math&gt;  \mathbf{V} \cdot \mathbf{W} = \| \mathbf{V} \|\| \mathbf{W} \| \cos a .   &lt;/math&gt; This implies

]]

====Mathematical preparation====
For any legal{{clarify|reason=The word legal is not generally used in formal scientific writing.|date=June 2015}} operators the following inequality, a consequence of the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]], is true.

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{4} |\langle (\hat{A} \hat{B} - \hat{B} \hat{A} )x | x \rangle|^2\leq \| \hat{A} x \|^2 \| \hat{B} x \|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''B A'' ψ and ''A B'' ψ are defined, then by subtracting the means and re-inserting in the above formula, we deduce
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta_{\psi} \hat{A} \, \Delta_{\psi} \hat{B} \ge \frac{1}{2} \left|\left\langle\left[{\hat{A}},{\hat{B}}\right]\right\rangle_\psi\right|

is the operator [[mean]] of observable ''X'' in the system state ψ and

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\psi} \hat{X} = \sqrt{\langle {\hat{X}}^2\rangle_\psi - \langle {\hat{X}}\rangle_\psi ^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here

\left[{\hat{A}},{\hat{B}}\right] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \hat{A} \hat{B} - \hat{B} \hat{A}
&lt;/math&gt;

is called the [[commutator]] of A and B.

This is a purely mathematical result. No reference has been made to any physical quantity or principle. It simply states that the uncertainty of one operator times the uncertainty of another operator has a lower bound.

====Application to angular momentum====
The connection to physics can be made if we identify the operators with physical operators such as the angular momentum and the polarization angle. We have then

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta_{\psi} \hat{l}_z \, \Delta_{\psi} {\theta} \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}, &lt;/math&gt;

which simply states that angular momentum '''and''' the polarization angle{{clarify|reason=The operator that make the polarization angle into an observable has not been defined or referenced.|date=June 2015}} cannot be measured simultaneously with infinite accuracy.

===States, probability amplitudes, unitary and Hermitian operators, and eigenvectors===

Much of the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics appears in the classical description of a polarized sinusoidal electromagnetic wave. The Jones vector for a classical wave, for instance, is identical with the quantum polarization state vector for a photon. The right and left circular components of the Jones vector can be interpreted as [[probability amplitude]]s of spin states of the photon. Energy conservation requires that the states be transformed with a unitary operation. This implies that infinitesimal transformations are transformed with a Hermitian operator. These conclusions are a natural consequence of the structure of Maxwell's equations for classical waves.

Quantum mechanics enters the picture when observed quantities are measured and found to be discrete rather than continuous. The allowed observable values are determined by the eigenvalues of the operators associated with the observable. In the case angular momentum, for instance, the allowed observable values are the eigenvalues of the spin operator.

These concepts have emerged naturally from [[Maxwell's equations]] and Planck's and Einstein's theories. They have been found to be true for many other physical systems. In fact, the typical program is to assume the concepts of this section and then to infer the unknown dynamics of a physical system. This was done, for instance, with the dynamics of electrons. In that case, working back from the principles in this section, the quantum dynamics of particles were inferred, leading to [[Schrödinger's equation]], a departure from [[Newtonian mechanics]]. The solution of this equation for atoms led to the explanation of the [[Balmer series]] for atomic spectra and consequently formed a basis for all of atomic physics and chemistry.

This is not the only occasion{{dubious|reason=I didn't see where Maxwell's equations "forced a restructuring of Newtonian mechanics" in the previous paragraphs. In the following, yes, but that has nothing to do with quantum mechanics or the purpose of the article.|date=August 2016}} in which Maxwell's equations have forced a restructuring of Newtonian mechanics. Maxwell's equations are relativistically consistent. [[Special relativity]] resulted from attempts to make classical mechanics consistent with Maxwell's equations (see, for example, [[Moving magnet and conductor problem]]).

'''Pity''' is a sympathetic sorrow evoked by the suffering of others and is used in a comparable sense to  ''[[compassion]]'', ''[[condolence]]'' or ''[[empathy]]''.  Through frequent, insincere, pejorative usage, it is used to connote feelings of superiority, condescension, or contempt.&lt;ref name="Stuff Pitty!"&gt;[http://www.newint.org/features/2005/11/01/keynote/ Stuff Pity!]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Den Leichnam des Darius.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander sees with a look of pity that Darius has died from his wounds.]]
[[File:Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy L, 1795 (Yale Center for British Art) The Human Abstract.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Human Abstract (poem)|The Human Abstract]]'', a poem in William Blake's collection ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', in which he proclaims "Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor" (1-2). This version is copy L created in 1795 and currently held by the [[Yale Center for British Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=songsie.l.illbk.47&amp;java=no| title = Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy L, object 47 (Bentley 47, Erdman 47, Keynes 47) "The Human Abstract" | editors = Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi| publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]|accessdate = June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The word ''pity'' comes from the Latin ''[[Pietas|pietās]]'', that is also etymon of ''[[piety]]''.

The word is often used in the translations from ancient Greek into English of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Poetics'' and ''Rhetoric''.  [[Aristotle]] argued (Rhetoric 2.8) that before a person can feel pity for another human, the person must first have experienced suffering of a similar type, and the person must also be somewhat distanced or removed from the sufferer.&lt;ref name="konstan"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Konstan|title=Pity Transformed|location=London|publisher=Duckworth|year=2001|pages=181|ISBN=0-7156-2904-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' he defines pity as follows: "Let pity, then, be a kind of pain in the case of an apparent destructive or painful harm of one not deserving to encounter it, which one might expect oneself, or one of one's own, to suffer, and this when it seems near".&lt;ref name="konstan" /&gt; Aristotle also pointed out that "people pity their acquaintances, provided that they are not exceedingly close in kinship; for concerning these they are disposed as they are concerning themselves...For what is terrible is different from what is pitiable, and is expulsive of pity".&lt;ref name="konstan" /&gt; Thus, from Aristotle's perspective, in order to feel pity, a person must believe that the person who is suffering does not deserve their fate.&lt;ref name="konstan" /&gt; Developing a traditional Greek view in his work on poetry, Aristotle also defines tragedy as a kind of imitative poetry that provokes pity and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', section 6.1449b24-28.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The religious concept of pity was reinforced in the West after the acceptance of Judeo-Christian concepts of God by the proposition of a deity which felt pity for all humanity. Consistent references to the concept of God's pity can be found in the older Jewish tradition. The Hebrew word "Hesed" translated in the LXX by "Eleos" carries the meaning roughly equivalent to pity in the sense of compassion, mercy and loving-kindness. (See The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament, 698a.) By the nineteenth century, two different kinds of pity had come to be distinguished, which we might call "benevolent pity" and "contemptuous pity" (see Kimball). David Hume observed that pity which has in it a strong mixture of good-will, is nearly allied to contempt, which is a species of dislike, with a mixture of pride. Pity is an [[emotion]] that almost always results from an encounter with a real or perceived unfortunate, injured, or pathetic creature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Jean-Jacques Rousseau had the following opinion of pity as opposed to love for others: "It is therefore certain that pity is a natural sentiment, which, by moderating in every individual the activity of self-love, contributes to the mutual preservation of the whole species. It is this pity which hurries us without reflection to the assistance of those we see in distress; it is this pity which, in a state of nature, stands for laws, for manners, for virtue, with this advantage, that no one is tempted to disobey her sweet and gentle voice: it is this pity which will always hinder a robust savage from plundering a feeble child, or infirm old man, of the subsistence they have acquired with pain and difficulty, if he has but the least prospect of providing for himself by any other means: it is this pity which, instead of that sublime maxim of argumentative justice, Do to others as you would have others do to you, inspires all men with that other maxim of natural goodness a great deal less perfect, but perhaps more useful, Consult your own happiness with as little prejudice as you can to that of others. It is in a word, in this natural sentiment, rather than in fine-spun arguments, that we must look for the cause of that reluctance which every man would experience to do evil, even independently of the maxims of education." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rousseau|first1=Jean-Jacques|title=Discourse on the origin of inequality|date=2004|publisher=Dover|location=Mineola|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person experiencing pity will experience a combination of intense [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]] and [[mercy]] for the person or creature, often giving the pitied some kind of [[aid]], physical help, and/or [[money|financial assistance]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Nietzsche, however, pointed out that since all people to some degree value [[self-esteem]] and [[self-worth]], pity can negatively affect any situation. Additionally, pity may actually be [[psychologically]] harmful to the pitied: [[Self-pity]] and [[Clinical depression|depression]] can sometimes be the result of the power imbalance fostered by pity, sometimes with extremely negative psychological and psycho-social consequences for the pitied party.

Though in his later works he reverses his position and sees Pity as an emotion that can draw beings together, [[mysticism|Mystic]] poet [[William Blake]] is known to have been ambivalent about the emotion Pity. In [[The Book of Urizen]] Pity begins when Los looks on the body of Urizen bound in chains (Urizen 13.50–51). However, Pity furthers the fall, "For pity divides the soul" (13.53), dividing Los and Enitharmon (Enitharmon is named Pity at her birth). Analyzers of this work assert that Blake shows that "Pity defuses the power of righteous indignation and proper prophetic wrath that lead to action. Pity is a distraction; the soul is divided between it and the action a 'pitiable' state demands. This is seen as Los's division into active male and tearful female, the latter deluding the former."{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Again railing against Pity in ''[[The Human Abstract (poem)|The Human Abstract]]'', Blake exclaims: "Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor" (1–2).

== Neurological perspectives ==
Modern neurology asserts that pity consists of an initial aversion to the plight of the sufferer, after which the higher parts of the brain make a more nuanced assessment of the situation (e.g., considering the context and invoking empathy, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[File:Raymond Kurzweil, Stanford 2006 (square crop).jpg|thumb|Ray Kurzweil in 2006]]

American author, inventor and [[futurist]] [[Raymond Kurzweil]] has become well known for his predictions about [[artificial intelligence]] and the human species, mainly concerning the [[Technological Singularity]]. He predicts that Artificial Intelligence would outsmart the human brain in computational capabilities by mid-21st century. His first book, ''[[The Age of Intelligent Machines]]'', published in 1990, put forth his theories on the results of the increasing use of technology and predicted the explosive growth in the internet, among other predictions. Later works, 1999's ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' and 2005's ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'' outlined other theories including the rise of clouds of nano-robots ([[nanobots]]) called [[utility fog|foglets]] and the development of Human Body 2.0 and 3.0, whereby [[nanotechnology]] is incorporated into many internal organs.

==Accuracy of predictions==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

===''The Age of Intelligent Machines''===
Kurzweil's first book, ''[[The Age of Intelligent Machines]]'', was published in 1990. It forecast the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|demise of the already crumpling Soviet Union]] due to new technologies such as cellular phones and fax machines disempowering authoritarian governments by removing state control over the flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Age of Intelligent Machines|date=1990|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-262-11121-7|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] told Kurzweil that emerging decentralized electronic communication "was a big factor" for fostering democracy in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Renee Blodgett |url=http://www.weblogtheworld.com/countries/northern-america/ray-kurzweil-on-gorbachev/ |title=Ray Kurzweil on Gorbachev |publisher=We Blog The World |date=April 20, 2005 |accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil extrapolated the performance of chess software to predict that computers would beat the best human players "by the year 2000".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Age of Intelligent Machines|date=1990|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-262-11121-7|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1997 chess World Champion [[Garry Kasparov]] was defeated by IBM's [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] computer in a well-publicized chess tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weber|first=Bruce|title=Swift and Slashing, Computer Topples Kasparav|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/12/nyregion/swift-and-slashing-computer-topples-kasparov.html|accessdate=February 13, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 12, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps most significantly, Kurzweil foresaw the explosive growth in worldwide Internet use that began in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coffman|first=K.G|title=Growth of the Internet|date=2001|publisher=AT&amp;T Labs Research|url=http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/oft.internet.growth.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the publication of ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'', there were only 2.6 million Internet users in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_2001_Feb/ai_70910777/pg_3 | work=UNESCO Courier | title=Fleeing the dot.com era – decline in Internet usage | first=Sally | last=Wyatt | date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the medium was often unreliable outside academic, military, corporate and other heavily invested settings, difficult for non-technical users to use, and mostly lacking a broad range of content. He also stated that the Internet would explode not only in the number of users but in content as well, eventually granting users access "to international networks of libraries, data bases, and information services".{{Cite quote|date=February 2013}} Additionally, Kurzweil correctly foresaw that the preferred mode of Internet access would inevitably be through wireless systems, and he was also correct to estimate that the latter would become practical for widespread use in the early 21st century.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===''The Age of Spiritual Machines''===
In 1999, Kurzweil published a second book titled ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'', which goes into more depth explaining his futurist ideas. The third and final section of the book is devoted to elucidating the specific course of technological advancements Kurzweil believes the world will experience over the next century. Titled "To Face the Future", the section is divided into four chapters respectively named "2009", "2019", "2029", and "2099". For every chapter, Kurzweil issues predictions about what life and technology will be like in that year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Kurzweil restated his earlier prediction from ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' regarding the advent of pocket-sized, cheap, text-to-speech converters for the blind by 2009. The [[K-NFB Reader|"Kurzweil-National Federation of the Blind Reader" (K-NFB Reader)]] was introduced in 2005 at a price of $3,495. The device was portable, but not the cheap, pocket-sized device of the prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The KNFB Reader becomes the Property of the Nation's Blind|url=https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm15/bm1506/bm150603.htm|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, a software version for the (pocket-sized) [[Nokia N82]] smartphone was available for $1,595.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KNFB Reader Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://knfbreader.com/faq.php|archivedate=February 8, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208144803/http://knfbreader.com/faq.php|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version for [[iOS]] phones was released for $99 in 2014 and [[Android_(operating_system)|Android]] for $75 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.inclusiveandroid.com/content/award-winning-text-recognition-app-gives-blind-access-print-now-available-android&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Singularity Is Near''===
While this book focuses on the future of technology and the human race as ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' and ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'' did, Kurzweil makes very few concrete, short-term predictions in ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'', though longer-term visions abound.

Kurzweil predicted that, in 2005, supercomputers with the ''computational capacities'' to simulate [[protein folding]] will be introduced.  In 2010, a supercomputer simulated protein folding for a very small protein at an atomic level over a period of a millisecond.  The protein folded and unfolded, with the results closely matching experimental data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heidi Ledford |title=Supercomputer sets protein-folding record |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101014/full/news.2010.541.html |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date = October 2010|accessdate=January 8, 2011 |doi=10.1038/news.2010.541}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The biyearly protein structure prediction contest [[CASP]] shows that the current algorithms for structure prediction are still impractical for determining the previously unknown structure of most proteins.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Other sources===
In an October 2002 article published on [http://www.Kurzweilai.net his website], Kurzweil stated that "[[Deep Fritz]]-like chess programs running on ordinary personal computers will routinely defeat all humans later in this decade."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0527.html?printable=1 Deep Fritz Draws: Are Humans Getting Smarter, or Are Computers Getting Stupider?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616094405/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0527.html?printable=1 |date=June 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Fritz is a computer chess program—generally considered superior to the older [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]] — that has defeated or tied a number of human chess masters and opposing chess programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/player/deep_fritz.html The chess games of Deep Fritz (Computer)].

===Ray Kurzweil's response===
According to Ray Kurzweil, 89 out of 108 predictions he made were entirely correct by the end of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nextbigfuture.com/2010/01/ray-kurzweil-responds-to-issue-of.html Ray Kurzweil Responds to the Issue of Accuracy of His Predictions], Next Big Future, January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Kurzweil later released a more detailed analysis of the accuracy of his predictions up to 2009, arguing that most were correct.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil, Ray (October 2010) [http://www.kurzweilai.net/predictions/download.php How My Predictions Are Faring].

*Telephone communication is mostly wireless.
*Cell phones display high resolution images. Users can engage in audio-video teleconferences.
*High resolution audio-visual cybersex is common, aided by falling costs of high-speed internet and computer hardware.
*At least 50% of all transactions are conducted over the internet.

*Though not yet ubiquitous, many households have one or more robots that perform some type of housekeeping.
*People often play music alongside digital musicians. (In "How My Predictions Are Faring" written in 2010, Kurzweil cited ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and Apple's ''Magic [[GarageBand]] Jam'' as two examples.)
*Audio-visual [[virtual reality]] has entered the mass market. Users can digitally tour real locations or play in highly immersive fantasy worlds. Tactile (haptic) VR technology is still primitive however.
*Militaries rely heavily on armed unmanned airborne devices.
*Death rates for cancer and heart disease have continued to fall as a result of improvements in medical technology.
*Telemedicine is common. Devices monitor and relay health-related data of many patients and send that information to doctors remotely. Teleconferencing between doctor and patient is also popular.
*Computers and medical software are capable enough at image and pattern recognition that they are routinely used to [[computer-aided diagnosis|help diagnose diseases]] by analyzing scans of patients.
*Doctors and medical students often train in virtual reality environments, which include haptic feedback and simulated patients.

====2019====
*The computational capacity of a $4,000 computing device (in 1999 dollars) is approximately equal to the computational capability of the [[human brain]] (20 quadrillion calculations per second).
*The summed computational powers of all computers is comparable to the total brainpower of the human race.
*Computers are embedded everywhere in the environment (inside of furniture, jewelry, walls, clothing, etc.).
*People experience 3-D virtual reality through glasses and contact lenses that beam images directly to their retinas (retinal display). Coupled with an auditory source (headphones), users can remotely communicate with other people and access the Internet.
*These special glasses and contact lenses can deliver "augmented reality" and "virtual reality" in three different ways. First, they can project "[[head-up display|heads-up-displays]]" (HUDs) across the user's field of vision, superimposing images that stay in place in the environment regardless of the user's perspective or orientation. Second, virtual objects or people could be rendered in fixed locations by the glasses, so when the user's eyes look elsewhere, the objects appear to stay in their places. Third, the devices could block out the "real" world entirely and fully immerse the user in a virtual reality environment.
*People communicate with their computers [[voice user interface|via two-way speech]] and [[gesture recognition|gestures]] instead of with keyboards. Furthermore, most of this interaction occurs through computerized assistants with different personalities that the user can select or customize. Dealing with computers thus becomes more and more like dealing with a human being.
*Most business transactions or information inquiries involve dealing with a simulated person.
*Most people own more than one PC, though the concept of what a "computer" is has changed considerably: Computers are no longer limited in design to laptops or CPUs contained in a large box connected to a monitor. Instead, devices with computer capabilities come in all sorts of unexpected shapes and sizes.
*Cables connecting computers and peripherals have almost completely disappeared.
*Rotating computer hard drives are no longer used.
*Three-dimensional nanotube lattices are the dominant computing substrate.
*Massively parallel neural nets and genetic algorithms are in wide use.
*Destructive scans of the brain and noninvasive brain scans have allowed scientists to understand the brain much better. The algorithms that allow the relatively small genetic code of the brain to construct a much more complex organ are being transferred into computer neural nets.
*Pinhead-sized cameras are everywhere.
*Nanotechnology is more capable and is in use for specialized applications, yet it has not yet made it into the mainstream. "Nanoengineered machines" begin to be used in manufacturing.
*Thin, lightweight, handheld displays with very high resolutions are the preferred means for viewing documents. The aforementioned computer eyeglasses and contact lenses are also used for this same purpose, and all download the information wirelessly.
*Computers have made paper books and documents almost completely obsolete.
*Most learning is accomplished through intelligent, adaptive courseware presented by computer-simulated teachers. In the learning process, human adults fill the counselor and mentor roles instead of being academic instructors. These assistants are often not physically present, and help students remotely.
*Students still learn together and socialize, though this is often done remotely via computers.
*All students have access to computers.
*Most human workers spend the majority of their time acquiring new skills and knowledge.
*Blind people wear special glasses that interpret the real world for them through speech. Sighted people also use these glasses to amplify their own abilities.
*Retinal and neural implants also exist, but are in limited use because they are less useful.
*Deaf people use special glasses that convert speech into text or signs, and music into images or tactile sensations. Cochlear and other implants are also widely used.
*People with spinal cord injuries can walk and climb steps using computer-controlled nerve stimulation and exoskeletal robotic walkers.
*Computers are also found inside of some humans in the form of cybernetic implants. These are most commonly used by disabled people to regain normal physical faculties (e.g. Retinal implants allow the blind to see and spinal implants coupled with mechanical legs allow the paralyzed to walk).
*Language translating machines are of much higher quality, and are routinely used in conversations.
*Effective language technologies (natural language processing, [[speech recognition]], speech synthesis) exist.
*Anyone can wirelessly access the internet with wearable devices such as computerized glasses, contacts, and watches.
*Traditional computers and communication devices such as desktop PCs, laptops, and cell phones still exist, but most of their functions can be performed by wearable gadgets. Examples include reading books, listening to music, watching movies, playing games, and teleconferencing.
*Devices that deliver sensations to the skin surface of their users (e.g. tight body suits and gloves) are also sometimes used in virtual reality to complete the experience. "Virtual sex"—in which two people are able to have sex with each other through virtual reality, or in which a human can have sex with a "simulated" partner that only exists on a computer—becomes a reality.
*Just as visual- and auditory virtual reality have come of age, [[haptic technology]] has fully matured and is completely convincing, yet requires the user to enter a V.R. booth. It is commonly used for computer sex and remote medical examinations. It is the preferred sexual medium since it is safe and enhances the experience.
*Worldwide economic growth has continued. There has not been a global economic collapse.
*The vast majority of business interactions occur between humans and simulated retailers, or between a human's virtual personal assistant and a simulated retailer.
*Household robots are ubiquitous and reliable.
*Computers do most of the vehicle driving—-humans are in fact prohibited from driving on highways unassisted. Furthermore, when humans do take over the wheel, the onboard computer system constantly monitors their actions and takes control whenever the human drives recklessly. As a result, there are very few transportation accidents.
*Most roads now have automated driving systems—networks of monitoring and communication devices that allow computer-controlled automobiles to safely navigate.
*Prototype personal flying vehicles using microflaps exist. They are also primarily computer-controlled.
*Humans are beginning to have deep relationships with automated personalities, which hold some advantages over human partners. The depth of some computer personalities convinces some people that they should be accorded more rights.
*Most decisions made by humans involve consultation with machine intelligence. For example, a doctor may seek the advice of a digital assistant. A lawyer might utilize a virtual researcher. Or a shopper may receive recommendations from a software program that has learned his or her shopping habits.
*While a growing number of humans believe that their computers and the simulated personalities they interact with are intelligent to the point of human-level consciousness, experts dismiss the possibility that any could pass the Turing Test.
*Human-robot relationships begin as simulated personalities become more convincing.
*Interaction with virtual personalities becomes a primary interface.
*Public places and workplaces are ubiquitously monitored to prevent violence and all actions are recorded permanently. Personal privacy is a major political issue, and some people protect themselves with unbreakable computer codes.
*The basic needs of the underclass are met. (Not specified if this pertains only to the developed world or to all countries)
*Virtual artists—creative computers capable of making their own art and music—emerge in all fields of the arts.
*Most flying weapons are bird-sized robots. Some are as small as insects.
*Average life expectancy is over 100.
*Computerized watches, clothing, and jewelry can monitor the wearers health continuously. They can detect many types of diseases and offer recommendations for treatment.

====2029====
*A $1,000 personal computer is 1,000 times more powerful than the human brain.
*The vast majority of computation is done by computers and not by human brains.
*Further progress has been made in understanding the secrets of the human brain. Hundreds of distinct sub-regions with specialized functions have been identified. Some of the algorithms that code for development of these regions have been deciphered and incorporated into neural net computers.
*Massively parallel neural nets, which are constructed through reverse-engineering the human brain, are in common use.
*The eyeglasses and headphones that used to deliver virtual reality are now obsolete thanks to computer implants that go into the eyes and ears. The implants are either permanent or removable. They allow direct interface with computers, communications and Internet-based applications. The implants are also capable of recording what the user sees and hears.
*Computer implants designed for direct connection to the brain are also available. They are capable of augmenting natural senses and of enhancing higher brain functions like memory, learning speed and overall intelligence.
*Computers are now capable of learning and creating new knowledge entirely on their own and with no human help. By scanning the enormous content of the Internet, some computers "know" literally every single piece of public information (every scientific discovery, every book and movie, every public statement, etc.) generated by human beings.
*Direct brain implants allow users to enter full-immersion virtual reality—with complete sensory stimulation—without any external equipment. People can have their minds in a totally different place at any moment. This technology is in widespread use.
*Most communication occurs between humans and machines as opposed to human-to-human.
*The manufacturing, agricultural and transportation sectors of the economy are almost entirely automated and employ very few humans. Across the world, poverty, war and disease are almost nonexistent thanks to technology alleviating want.
*The rise of Artificial Intelligence creates a real "[[robot rights]]" movement, and there is open, public debate over what sorts of civil rights and legal protections machines should have. The existence of humans with heavy levels of cybernetic augmentation and of larger numbers of other people with less extreme cybernetic implants lead to further arguments over what constitutes a "human being."
*Although computers routinely pass the Turing Test, controversy still persists over whether machines are as intelligent as humans in all areas.
*Artificial Intelligences claim to be conscious and openly petition for recognition of the fact. Most people admit and accept this new truth.
* Reverse engineering of the human brain completed
* Non-biological intelligence combines the subtlety and pattern recognition strength of human intelligence, with the speed, memory, and knowledge sharing of machine intelligence
* Non-biological intelligence will continue to grow exponentially whereas biological intelligence is effectively fixed in its rate of growth

====2049====
*Food is commonly "assembled" by nanomachines. This food is externally indistinguishable from "natural" food, but it can be made more wholesome since production can be controlled at the molecular level. This technology decouples food production from climate conditions and the availability of natural resources.
*The distinction between virtual reality and "real" reality becomes confounded as [[Utility fog|foglets]] come into common use, allowing immediate assembly or disassembly of all sorts of physical objects.

====2072====
*[[Picoengineering]] (technology on the scale of trillionths of a meter) becomes practical.

====2099====
*The human brain has been completely reverse engineered and all aspects of its functioning are understood.
*Natural human thinking possesses no advantages over computer minds.
*Machines have attained equal legal status with humans.
*Humans and machines merge in the physical and mental realms. Cybernetic brain implants enable humans to fuse their minds with AI's.
*In consequence, clear distinctions between humans and machines no longer exist.
*Most conscious beings lack a permanent physical form.
*The vast majority of the Earth's sentient beings are AI's that exist entirely as thinking computer programs capable of instantly moving from one computer to another across the Internet (or whatever equivalent exists in 2099). These computer-based beings are capable of manifesting themselves at will in the physical world by creating or taking over robotic bodies, with individual AI's also being capable of controlling multiple bodies at once.
*Individual beings merge and separate constantly, making it impossible to determine how many “people” there are on Earth.
*This new plasticity of consciousness and ability for beings to join minds seriously alters the nature of self-identity.
*The majority of interpersonal interactions occur in virtual environments. Actually having two people physically meet in the real world to have a conversation or transact business without any technological interference is very rare.
*Organic human beings are a small minority of the intelligent life forms on Earth. Even among the remaining ''Homo sapiens'', the use of computerized implants that heavily augment normal abilities is ubiquitous and accepted as normal. The small fraction of humans who opt to remain "natural" and unmodified effectively exist on a lower and more limited plane of consciousness from everyone else, and thus find it impossible to fully interact with AI's and highly modified humans.
*"Natural" humans are protected from extermination. In spite of their shortcomings and frailties, humans are respected by AI's for giving rise to the machines.
*Since knowledge and skills can be instantly downloaded and comprehended by most intelligent beings, the process of learning is compressed into an instantaneous affair instead of the years-long struggle normal humans experience. Free from this time-consuming burden, AI's now focus their energies on making new discoveries and contributions.
*AI's are capable of dividing their attention and energies in countless directions, allowing one being to manage a multitude of endeavors simultaneously.
*Femtoengineering (engineering on the scale of one thousandth of a trillionth of a meter) might be possible.
*AI's communicate via a shared electronic language.
*Artwork and music created by machines encompasses areas of the light spectrum and frequencies of sounds that normal humans cannot perceive.
*Money has deflated in value, meaning all sorts of goods and services have become cheaper.
*Some humans at least as old as the Baby Boomers are still alive and well.
*Computer viruses are a major threat since most intelligent beings are software-based.
*AI's frequently make "backup copies" of themselves, guaranteeing a sort of immortality should the original AI be killed.
*The concept of "life expectancy" has become irrelevant to humans and machines thanks to medical immortality and advanced computers.
*The pace of technological change continues to accelerate as the 22nd century nears.

====Thousands of years from now====
*"Intelligent beings consider the fate of all the Universe."

===''The Singularity is Near'' (2005)===
{{Page numbers needed|section|date=July 2016}}

====2010====
*Supercomputers will have the same raw computing power as human brains, though the software to emulate human thinking on those computers does not yet exist. ([[IBM Sequoia]])
*Computers will start to disappear as distinct physical objects, meaning many will have nontraditional shapes or will be embedded in clothing and everyday objects.
*Full-immersion audio-visual virtual reality will exist.

====2015====
*By now, it is likely that "clean a house" will be within the capabilities of a household robot.

====2018====
*10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; bits (=10 TB) of computer memory—roughly the equivalent of the memory space in a single human brain—will cost $1000.
10 terabytes of storage (not memory) have been already reached for $535 (Seagate Barracuda 10TB) in mid 2016.

====2010s====
* The decade in which "Bridge Two", the revolution in Genetics/Biotechnology, is to reach its peak. During the 2020s, humans will have the means of changing their genes; not just "[[designer babies]]" will be feasible, but designer baby boomers through the rejuvenation of all of one's body's tissues and organs by transforming one's skin cells into youthful versions of every other cell type. People will be able to "reprogram" their own biochemistry away from disease and aging, radically extending life expectancy.
*Computers become smaller and increasingly integrated into everyday life.
*More and more computer devices will be used as miniature web servers, and more will have their resources pooled for computation.
*High-quality broadband Internet access will become available almost everywhere.
*Eyeglasses that beam images onto the users' retinas to produce virtual reality will be developed. They will also come with speakers or headphone attachments that will complete the experience with sounds.  These eyeglasses will become a new medium for [[advertising]] which will be wirelessly transmitted to them as one walks by various business establishments. This was fictionalized in [[Dennō Coil]].
*The VR glasses will also have built-in computers featuring "virtual assistant" programs that can help the user with various daily tasks. 
*Virtual assistants would be capable of multiple functions. One useful function would be real-time language translation in which words spoken in a foreign language would be translated into text that would appear as subtitles to a user wearing the glasses. 
*Cell phones will be built into clothing and will be able to project sounds directly into the ears of their users. 
*Advertisements will utilize a new technology whereby two ultrasonic beams can be targeted to intersect at a specific point, delivering a localized sound message that only a single person can hear.

====2020s====
* The decade in which "Bridge Three", the revolution in Nanotechnology, is to begin: allowing humans to vastly overcome the inherent limitations of biology, as no matter how much humanity fine-tunes its biology, they will never be as capable otherwise. This decade also marks the revolution in Robotics ([[Artificial general intelligence|Strong AI]]), as an AI is expected to pass the [[Turing test]] by the last year of the decade (2029), meaning it can pass for a human being (though the first A.I. is likely to be the equivalent of an average, educated human). What follows then will be an era of consolidation in which nonbiological intelligence will undergo exponential growth (Runaway AI), eventually leading to the extraordinary expansion contemplated by the Singularity, in which human intelligence is multiplied by billions by the mid-2040s.
*Early in this decade, humanity will have the requisite hardware to emulate human intelligence within a $1000 personal computer, followed shortly by effective software models of human intelligence toward the middle of the decade: this will be enabled through the continuing exponential growth of brain-scanning technology, which is doubling in bandwidth, temporal and spatial resolution every year, and will be greatly amplified with nanotechnology, allowing us to have a detailed understanding of all the regions of the human brain and to aid in developing human-level machine intelligence by the end of this decade.
*Computers less than 100&amp;nbsp;nm in size will be possible.
*As one of their first practical applications, [[nanomachines]] are used for medical purposes.
*Highly advanced medical [[nanobots]] will perform detailed [[Neuroimaging|brainscans]] on live patients.
*Accurate computer simulations of the entire human brain will exist due to these hyperaccurate brainscans, and the workings of the brain will be understood.
*Nanobots capable of entering the bloodstream to "feed" cells and extract waste will exist (though not necessarily be in wide use) by the end of this decade. They will make the normal mode of human food consumption obsolete.
*By the late 2020s, nanotech-based manufacturing will be in widespread use, radically altering the economy as all sorts of products can suddenly be produced for a fraction of their traditional-manufacture costs. The true cost of any product is now the amount it takes to download the design schematics.
*By the later part of this decade, virtual reality will be so high-quality that it will be indistinguishable from real reality.
*The threat posed by genetically engineered [[pathogens]] permanently dissipates by the end of this decade as medical nanobots—infinitely more durable, intelligent and capable than any microorganism—become sufficiently advanced.
*The many variations of "Human Body 2.0" (as Kurzweil calls it) are incrementally accumulated into this and the following decade, with each organ and body system having its own course of refinement and development. It ultimately consists of a nanotechnological system of nourishment and circulation, obsolescing many internal organs, brain-extension and an improved skeleton.

====2023====
*10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; calculations per second—roughly the equivalent of one human brain—will cost $1,000.

====2025====
*The most likely year for the debut of advanced nanotechnology.
*Some military [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s and land vehicles will be 100% computer-controlled.

====2030s====
*[[Mind uploading]] becomes successful and perfected by the end of this decade as humans become software-based: living out on the Web, projecting bodies whenever they want or need (whether in virtual or real reality), and living indefinitely so long as they maintain their "mind file". Eventually, all human beings (including those with [[transbiological]] 2.0 or 3.0 bodies) will migrate to this [[postbiological]] state except for those who wish to remain unenhanced: the transbiological era giving way to the postbiological era.
*Nanomachines could be directly inserted into the brain and could interact with brain cells to totally control incoming and outgoing signals. As a result, truly full-immersion virtual reality could be generated without the need for any external equipment. [[Afferent nerve fiber|Afferent nerve]] pathways could be blocked, totally cancelling out the "real" world and leaving the user with only the desired virtual experience.
*Brain nanobots could also elicit emotional responses from users.
*Using brain nanobots, recorded or real-time brain transmissions of a person's daily life known as "experience beamers" will be available for other people to remotely experience. This is very similar to how the characters in ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'' were able to enter the mind of Malkovich and see the world through his eyes.
*Recreational uses aside, nanomachines in peoples' brains will allow them to greatly expand their cognitive, memory and sensory capabilities, to directly interface with computers, and to "telepathically" communicate with other, similarly augmented humans via wireless networks.
*The same nanotechnology should also allow people to alter the neural connections within their brains, changing the underlying basis for the person's intelligence, memories and personality.
*The many variations of "Human Body 3.0" are gradually implemented during this and the following decade; It most likely lacks a fixed, corporeal form and can alter its shape and external appearance at will via foglet-like nanotechnology.

====2040s====
*People spend most of their time in full-immersion virtual reality (Kurzweil has cited ''[[The Matrix]]'' as a good example of what the advanced virtual worlds will be like, without the dystopian twist).
*[[Utility fog|Foglet]]s are in use.
*Nonbiological intelligence will be billions of times more capable than biological intelligence.

====2045: The Singularity====
*$1000 buys a computer a billion times more intelligent than every human combined. This means that average and even low-end computers are vastly smarter than even highly intelligent, unenhanced humans.
*The [[technological singularity]] occurs as artificial intelligences surpass human beings as the smartest and most capable life forms on the Earth. Technological development is taken over by the machines, who can think, act and communicate so quickly that normal humans cannot even comprehend what is going on. The machines enter into a "runaway reaction" of self-improvement cycles, with each new generation of A.I.s appearing faster and faster. From this point onwards, technological advancement is explosive, under the control of the machines, and thus cannot be accurately predicted (hence the term "Singularity").
*The Singularity is an extremely disruptive, world-altering event that forever changes the course of human history. The extermination of humanity by violent machines is unlikely (though not impossible) because sharp distinctions between man and machine will no longer exist thanks to the existence of cybernetically enhanced humans and uploaded humans.

====Post-2045: "Waking up" the Universe====
*The physical bottom limit to how small computer transistors (or other equivalent, albeit more effective components, such as [[memristors]] integrated into [[Crossbar latch]]es) can be shrunk is reached. From this moment onwards, computers can only be made more powerful if they are made larger in size.
*Because of this, A.I.s convert more and more of the Earth's matter into engineered, computational substrate capable of supporting more A.I.s. until the whole Earth is one, gigantic computer, except for a few [[nature reserves]] set aside on the planetary surface for those humans who decided to remain in their natural state. "MOSH's" (Mostly Original Substrate Human) who choose to remain purely organic would still possess virtual assistants that will act as their transcendent servants, living in the blurred real world ("foglet-reality") and being provided with environments and everything they could possibly need as they live out the rest of their normal lives unless they enhance themselves.
*At this point, the only possible way to increase the intelligence of the machines any farther is to begin converting all of the matter and energy in the universe into similar massive computers. A.I.s radiate outward from Earth, first into the [[Solar System]] and then out into [[interstellar space]], then galaxies in all directions, utilizing [[starship]]s that are [[Von Neumann probes]] with nanobot crews, breaking down whole planets, stars, moons, and meteoroids and reassembling them into computers. This, in effect, "wakes up" the universe as all the inanimate "dumb" matter (rocks, dust, gases, etc.) is converted into structured matter capable of supporting life (albeit synthetic life).
*Kurzweil predicts that machines might have the ability to make [[Jupiter Brain|planet-sized computers]] by 2099, which underscores how enormously technology will advance after the Singularity.
*The process of "waking up" the universe could be completed well before the end of the 22nd century, provided humans are not limited by the speed of light.
*With the entire universe made into a giant, highly efficient supercomputer, AI and human hybrids (so integrated that, in truth it is a new category of "life") would have both supreme intelligence and physical control over the universe. It is unknown what events will happen in a post cosmic computer mind era, but whatever it is, it will truly be incomprehensible in every sense of the word to feeble human minds. Perhaps an infinite unification of infinite saturated universes, multiverses, and omniverses, an endless vast collection of united cosmic computers possibly.
====Some indeterminate points within a few decades from now====
*Space technology becomes advanced enough to provide the Earth permanent protection from the threat of asteroid impacts.
*The antitechnology [[Luddite]] movement will grow increasingly vocal and possibly resort to violence as these people become enraged over the emergence of new technologies that threaten traditional attitudes regarding the nature of human life (radical life extension, genetic engineering, cybernetics) and the supremacy of mankind (artificial intelligence). Though the Luddites might, at best, succeed in delaying the Singularity, the march of technology is irresistible and they will inevitably fail in keeping the world frozen at a fixed level of development.
*The emergence of distributed energy grids and full-immersion virtual reality will, when combined with high bandwidth Internet, enable the ultimate in [[telecommuting]]. This, in turn, will make cities obsolete since workers will no longer need to be located near their workplaces. The decentralization of the population will make societies less vulnerable to terrorist and military attacks.

Kurzweil said in a 2006 C-SPAN2 interview that "nanotechnology-based" flying cars would be available in 20 years.&lt;ref name=booktv&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?194500-1/depth-ray-kurzweil |title=In Depth with Ray Kurzweil |publisher=[[Book TV]] |date=November 5, 2006 |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil has said that by 2014, humanity will reach a "tipping point" where the cost-per-watt from solar energy is cheaper than from coal and oil: By capturing only 0.03 percent of the sun's energy that falls on Earth, humanity could meet virtually all of its projected energy needs up to 2030&lt;ref&gt;Human 2.0. By: Kurzweil, Ray, New Scientist, 02624079, September 24, 2005, Vol. 187, Issue 2518&lt;/ref&gt; (thirty trillion watts); this will be capable through with extremely inexpensive, lightweight, and efficient nano-engineered solar panels together with nano-fuel cells to store and distribute the captured energy. Kurzweil believes, by the end of the 2020s, humans will be able to completely replace fossil fuels.

Kurzweil has said that by the 2030s, people will be able to send nano-bots into their brains through their capillaries. The nano-bots will take up positions in close physical proximity to each interneuronal connection coming from each physical sense and cause the firing of neurons to result in full-immersion virtual reality, similar to the way psychedelic drugs alter consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/04/12/virtual-reality-will-come-from-inside-our-brain-not-goggles-says-ray-kurzweil/|title=Virtual reality via nanobot injection?

Kurzweil said the following in a November 2007 ''Computerworld'' interview:

*By the same year, practical virtual reality glasses will be in use. The devices will work by beaming images directly onto the retinas of their users, creating large, three-dimensional floating images in the person's field of view. Such devices would provide a visual experience on par with a very large television, but would be highly portable, combining the best features of a [[Portable media player|portable video player]] and a widescreen TV. The glasses will deliver full-immersion virtual reality.&lt;ref name=thegrill/&gt;
*By 2017, "augmented reality" will exist: The V.R. glasses previously mentioned will have advanced computers and sensors built into them that will be able to recognize elements within the user's environment and then provide appropriate information and assistance through visual or auditory means. If the user looks at a building or a person's face, the computer will provide information through a "heads-up-display" beamed onto the person's retinas. The devices could also be used for keeping track of schedules, navigating, and querying for general information.&lt;ref name=thegrill/&gt;
* "By 2019, we will largely overcome the major diseases that kill 95 percent of us in the developed world, and we will be dramatically slowing and reversing the dozen or so processes that underlie aging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Derek|title=Ray Kurzweil's Future|url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2006/08/09/ray_kurzweils_future|website=In The Pipeline|publisher=Science|accessdate=November 21, 2015|authorlink=Derek Lowe (chemist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*By 2022, medical technology will be more than a thousand times more advanced than it is today, and the "tipping point" of human life expectancy will have been reached, with every new year of research guaranteeing at least one more year of life expectancy. Kurzweil also states that 3–4 months of life expectancy were added in 2007 due to the development of new medicines and treatments.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;
*Cell phones and PCs will be increasingly woven into a global grid of computers wirelessly connected to the Internet. Instead of each device just sending and receiving its own data, more and more of the machines will be tasked with processing foreign data, creating a huge, interconnected network with millions of nodes.
*By 2027, accurate computer simulations of all parts of the human brain will exist.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

==Criticism==
In the cover article of the December 2010 issue of ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'', [[John Rennie (editor)|John Rennie]] criticized Kurzweil's predictions: "On close examination, his clearest and most successful predictions often lack originality or profundity. And most of his predictions come with so many loopholes that they border on the unfalsifiable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Rennie |author-link=John Rennie (editor) |title=Ray Kurzweil's slippery futurism |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/ray-kurzweils-slippery-futurism |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |date = December 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''social construction of gender''' is a notion in [[feminist theory|feminism]] and [[sociology]] about the operation of gender and gender differences in societies.&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lindsey | first = Linda L. | chapter = The sociology of gender | chapterurl = http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0132448300.pdf | title = Gender roles: a sociological perspective | page = 4 | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston | year = 2015 | isbn = 9780205899685 | quote = Gender refers to those social, cultural, and psychological traits linked to males and females through particular social contexts.

Some supporters of this idea argue that the differences in behavior between men and women are entirely social conventions, whereas others believe that behavior is influenced by universal biological factors to varying degrees, with social conventions having a major effect on gendered behavior.

===Social constructionism===
{{main article|Social constructionism}}
The roots of the social constructionist movement in psychology are related to the criticism of the objectivism assumed by positivist/empiricist concepts of knowledge (Gergen, 1985).
Among the most popular variations of the social constructionist theories is the gender role theory, considered by Alsop, Fitzsimons and Lennon (2002) as an early form of social constructionism.
The focus on power and hierarchy reveals inspiration stemming from a Marxist framework, utilized for instance by materialist feminism, and Foucault's writings on discourse.
[[Social constructionism]], briefly, is the concept that there are many things that people "know" or take to be "reality" that are at least partially, if not completely, socially situated.&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Berger | first1 = Peter | last2 = Luckmann | first2 = Thomas | title = The social construction of reality : a treatise in the sociology of knowledge | publisher = Penguin | location = London | year = 1966 | url = http://perflensburg.se/Berger%20social-construction-of-reality.pdf | isbn = 9780141931630 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] writes that "some categories really are social constructions: they exist only because people tacitly agree to act as if they exist. Examples include money, [[tenure]], [[citizenship]], decorations for bravery, and the presidency of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pinker | first = Steven | author-link = Steven Pinker | chapter = In touch with reality | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G3_UAeo8Dh0C&amp;pg=PA310 | title = The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature | page = 202 | publisher = Allen Lane, Penguin Books | location = London | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780713996722 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic assumptions of social constructionism, as described by Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp,&lt;ref name="Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp" /&gt; are:
# ''[[Social constructionism]] is a theory of knowledge''. Social constructionism focuses on how meaning is created. Emerging from the criticism of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], social constructionism challenges concepts of knowledge put forward by [[positivism]], which postulates the externality of reality and that empirically-proved truths are mind-independent.&lt;ref name="Gergen, K. J."&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gergen | first = Kenneth J. | title = The social constructionist movement in modern psychology | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 266&amp;ndash;275 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.40.3.266 | date = March 1985 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.swarthmore.edu/Documents/faculty/gergen/Social_Constructionist_Movement.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp, knowledge is an "account of reality produced collaboratively by a community of knowers"&lt;ref name="Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp" /&gt; Thus, social constructionism focuses on how meaning is created.
# ''Knowledge is a social product''. According to Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp, knowledge is an "account of reality produced collaboratively by a community of knowers".&lt;ref name="Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp" /&gt; Thus, social constructionists focus on how meaning is created and suggest that knowledge is not only a social product, but a product of a specifically situated society; various accounts of reality depend on place and time – in order to study knowledge as a social product, one has to historicize and contextualize the given description of reality.
# ''Power and hierarchy underlie social construction''. This focus results in showing how individuals differ in status, entitlement, efficacy, self-respect and other traits based on the kind of interactions one is involved in and subjected to.
# ''Language is at the core of knowledge''. Language is considered the building block of culture; it conveys meaning and creates the system of knowledge humans participate in. Ultimately, language has a huge influence on how humans perceive reality and, as a result, is the creator of this reality.
# ''Social construction is a dynamic process''. Social constructionists emphasize the complexity of how knowledge is created in social interactions. Knowledge and meanings are not stable or constant; they are co-constructed in interactions with others, negotiated, modified and shifted. People are active in their perception, understanding and sharing of knowledge acquired from their social milieu. It is prudent therefore to consider this process when explaining the social construction of knowledge, including knowledge concerning gender.
# ''The individual and society are indissoluble''. Social constructionists question the Western idea of an autonomous individual who can draw a clear line between the self and the society. According to social constructionism, individuals can create meaning only in relation to what they are exposed to in their environment. Paradoxically, the same individuals co-create the meanings that are available in this environment. Marecek et al. conclude therefore that the society and the individual are indissoluble and mutually constitutive.

Alsop, Fitzsimmons &amp; Lennon also note that the constructionist accounts of gender creation can be divided into two main streams:&lt;ref name="Alsop_Theorizing"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Alsop | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Fitzsimons | first2 = Annette | last3 = Lennon | first3 = Kathleen | chapter = The social construction of gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zwxuGrcA_RgC | title = Theorizing gender | pages = 64&amp;ndash;93 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745619446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Materialist theories'', which underline the structural aspects of the social environment that are responsible for perpetuating certain gender roles;
# ''Discursive theories'', which stress the creation, through language and culture, of meanings that are associated with gender.

They also argue that both the materialist and discursive theories of social construction of gender can be either [[Essentialism|essentialist]] or [[Non-essentialism|non-essentialist]]. This means that some of these theories assume a clear biological division between women and men when considering the social creation of masculinity and femininity, while other contest the assumption of the biological division between the sexes as independent of social construction.

===Gender===
{{main article|Gender}}
Gender, according to West and Zimmerman, is not a personal trait; it is "an emergent feature of social situations: both as an outcome of and a rationale for various social arrangements, and as a means of legitimating one of the most fundamental divisions of society."&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]
:* {{cite book | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | chapter = Doing gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&amp;pg=PA3 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | pages = 3&amp;ndash;25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}} Historically, the term [[gender]] was adopted as means of distinguishing between biological sex and socialized aspects of femininity and masculinity.&lt;ref name="Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Marecek | first1 = Jeanne | last2 = Crawford | first2 = Mary | last3 = Popp | first3 = Danielle | chapter = On the construction of gender, sex, and sexualities | chapterurl = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16374-009 | editor1-last = Eagly | editor1-first = Alice H. | editor2-last = Beall | editor2-first = Anne E. | editor3-last = Sternberg | editor3-first = Robert J. | title = The psychology of gender | pages = 192&amp;ndash;216 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781593852443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, gender was considered achieved and more or less stable after it is acquired in early childhood. Contemporary constructionist perspective, as proposed by Fenstermaker and West, proposes treating gender as an activity ("doing") of utilizing normative prescriptions and beliefs about sex categories based on situational variables. These "gender activities" constitute our belonging to a sex as based on the socially accepted dichotomy of "women" and "men". It is noted, however, that these activities are not always perceived (by the audience) as being either "masculine" or "feminine", they are at constant risk of being assessed as more or less "womanly" or "manly"; ultimately, any behavior may be judged based upon its "manly" or "womanly" nature. "Doing gender" is in fact based on these interactions that are constituted of ongoing assessments in various situations. This in turn points to the situational nature of gender rather than its inherent, essentialist and individual nature.

====Gender roles====
[[Gender roles]] are often centred around the conceptions of femininity or masculinity.  In our society today, women are socialized as being the caretakers of the house, who nurture the children, cook and clean.  With men, they "should" be the workhorse, the provider, protector, a leader, and a teacher to his family.&lt;ref&gt;{https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/the-roles-of-woman-as-leader-and-housewife-2167-0374-1000125.php?aid=55999}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical investigations suggest that gender roles are "social constructs that vary significantly across time, context, and culture".{{refn|name=Levant &amp; Alto}} [[Ronald F. Levant]] and Kathleen Alto write: {{quote |A recent synthesis of meta-analytic studies of gender differences provides strong evidence for a social construct understanding of gender. Ethan Zell and colleagues examined more than 20,000 findings from 12 million participants comparing men and women on topics ranging from risk-taking to body image. The authors found that the majority of effects were very small to small, indicating far more similarities than differences between genders.&lt;ref name="Levant &amp; Alto"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levant |first1=R.F. |last2=Alto |first2=K.M. |editor=Nadal, Kevin L. |title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Psychology and Gender |date=2017 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-48-338427-6 |page=718 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=lVYoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA718&amp;lpg=PA718&amp;dq=%22studies+of+gender+differences%22 |chapter=Gender Role Strain Paradigm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A study in 2017 found that health risks are set by the behaviors that are instilled in males and females by the time they're 10 or 11.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/20/health/geas-gender-stereotypes-study/index.html{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender roles, according to Berkowitz, are an acceptance of social construction as it pertains to gender and the roles we perform.  "The gender order is hierarchical in that, overall, men dominate women in terms of power and privilege; yet multiple and conflicting sources of power and oppression are intertwined, and not all men dominate all women. Intersectionality theorizes how gender intersects with race, ethnicity, social class, sexuality, and nation in variegated and situationally contingent ways".&lt;ref&gt;(Berkowitz 133){{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constructionism of gender and stereotyped roles can be examined through a given environment. A certain gendered patriarchy turns abstraction into material reality. This reality is negotiated into each interaction we have. For example, based on a simulation discussed in “Walk Like a Man, Talk Like a Woman”, the simulation used “demonstrates the social constructiveness of gender, maintaining that gender should be conceptualized and portrayed as a process, system of stratification, and social structure”.&lt;ref&gt;(Berkowitz 1){{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perceptions of the social world in which these students view the world around them is as an “objective reality rather than as a product of human interaction and interpretation that is institutionalized and transformed over time”.&lt;ref&gt;(Berkowitz 1){{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most powerful notions that this simulation encourages is teaching from a constructionist perspective that requires instructors to “challenge perceptions by requiring students to unpack the “hows and whys” of sociological phenomena”.&lt;ref&gt;(Berkowitz 1){{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender identity and sexuality/sexual orientation====
{{Wiktionary|gender identity}}

[[Lisa M. Diamond]] argues that [[gender identity]] is not a stable, fixed trait – rather, it is socially constructed and may vary over time for an individual.&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9425-3 |title=Questioning Gender and Sexual Identity: Dynamic Links over Time |journal=Sex Roles |volume=59 |issue=5–6 |pages=365–376 |year=2008 |last1=Diamond |first1=Lisa M |last2=Butterworth |first2=Molly }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[Albert Bandura|Bandura]] and Bussey shows that kids want to be like others of their sex. Social [[conformity]] has been widely studied on adolescents. Results showed that 6-year-old children tend to conform to choices that their peers find more popular. They begin labeling objects as "for girls" or "for boys" and conform to what is expected of them. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=5175193|year=2016|last1=Sun|first1=S|title=Social conformity persists at least one day in 6-year-old children|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=39588|last2=Yu|first2=R|doi=10.1038/srep39588|pmid=28000745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bussey"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bussey | first1 = Kay | last2 = Bandura | first2 = Albert | author-link = Albert Bandura | title = Social cognitive theory of gender development and differentiation | journal = [[Psychological Review]] | volume = 106 | issue = 4 | pages = 676&amp;ndash;713 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.106.4.676 | pmid = 10560326 | date = October 1999 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; West and Zimmerman argue that the notion of womanhood or femininity is accomplished through an active process of creating gender through interacting with others in a particular social context.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt; Society typically only recognizes two genders.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Therefore, when transgender individuals want to have a sex change operation, they must prove that they can "pass" as a man or woman{{Disputed inline |text=they must prove that they can "pass" |for=The WPATH SOC criteria for SRS have no such requirement to "pass" |reason=sounds like the editor who added this is confusing RLE/RLT and "passing" but they are not at all the same, and passing is definitely not required |date=December 2017}} – so even the choice of changing one's gender is socially constructed.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In recent years, elementary schools in the U.S. have started carrying chapter books that include either non-traditional families with same-sex parents, homosexual role models, or (in fewer cases) an adolescent who is dealing with their own sexuality/sexual orientation. Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan acknowledge this rise in representation, while critiquing the way that the limited selection of books present these characters with an eye towards popularized characterizations of homosexuality.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan|first=Jill M. and Caitlin L.|date=December 2016|title=Queering Chapter Books with LGBT Characters for Young Readers: Recognizing and Complicating Representations of Homonormativity|url=|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|volume=37|pages=846-866|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors characterize this style of representation as "Homonormative," and in the only example of a book where the protagonist questions their gender identity, it is left ambiguous as to whether or not they are a transman or that they were simply pretending.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Diamond and Butterworth argue that gender identity and sexual identity are fluid and do not always fall into two essentialist categories (man or woman and gay or straight); they came to this conclusion via interviews with sexual minority women over the course of ten years.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt; One woman had a relatively normal early childhood but around adolescence questioned her sexuality and remained stable in her gender and sexual identity until she started working with men and assumed a masculine "stance" and started to question her gender identity.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt; When 'she' became a 'he' he began to find men attractive and gradually identified as a homosexual man.

The perception of sexuality by others is an extension of others' perceptions of one's gender. Heterosexuality is assumed for those individuals who appear to act appropriately masculine or appropriately feminine. If one wants to be perceived as a lesbian, one must first be perceived as a woman; if one wants to be seen as a gay man, one has to be seen as a man.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman"/&gt;{{rp|145}}

=====Core gender identity=====
The sense of one's gender identity is acquired through the internalization of external knowledge.{{Cn|date=May 2018}}  However, it is in fact never fully acquired – it has to be constantly performed and reenacted in social interactions.{{cn|date=May 2018}}  According to Alsop, Fitzsimmons &amp; Lennon, "Gender is part of an identity woven from a complex and specific social whole, and requiring very specific and local readings".&lt;ref name="Alsop_Theorizing" /&gt;{{rp|86}} Thus, gender identity can be defined as part of socially situated understanding of gender. LaFrance, Paluck and Brescoll note that as a term, "gender identity" allows individuals to express their attitude towards and stance in relation to their current status as either women or men. Turning the scope of gender from a social consensus to objectivity to one's self-identification with a certain gender expression leaves much more space for describing variation among individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = LaFrance | first1 = Marianne | last2 = Paluck | first2 = Elizabeth Levy  | last3 = Brescoll | first3 = Victoria | chapter = Sex changes: a current perspective on the psychology of gender | chapterurl = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16374-014 | editor1-last = Eagly | editor1-first = Alice H. | editor2-last = Beall | editor2-first = Anne E. | editor3-last = Sternberg | editor3-first = Robert J. | title = The psychology of gender | pages = 328&amp;ndash;344 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781593852443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Intersections of gender identity with other identities=====

The way gender is constructed for an individual depends on gendered interactions the individual has with others as well as other identities or roles he or she may have. Gender, race, class, and other oppressions are all potential omnirelevant categories, though they are not ALL identically salient in every set of social relationships in which inequality is done.{{Clarify|date=August 2014}} Multiple oppressions are not seen as having "additive" or "multiplicative" effects but are seen as simultaneously depending on each other to create a unique form of oppression. Although West and Fenstermaker do not elaborate on exactly how intersectionality can be incorporated into social constructionist theory, they do say that intersecting social identities are constant "interactional accomplishments".&lt;ref name="F&amp;W_Institutional"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fenstermaker | first1 = Sarah | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Reply - (re)doing difference | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&amp;pg=PA95 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | pages = 95&amp;ndash;104 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96}}

While men and women are held accountable for normative conceptions of gender, this accountability can differ in content based on ethnicity, race, age, class, etc. Hurtado argues that white women and women of color experience gender differently because of their relationship to males of different races and that both groups of women have traditionally been used to substantiate male power in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hurtado | first = Aída | title = Relating to privilege: seduction and rejection in the subordination of white women and women of color | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Women in Culture and Society]], special issue: Common Grounds and Crossroads: Race, Ethnicity, and Class in Women's Lives | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 833&amp;ndash;855 | doi = 10.1086/4945464 | jstor = 3174686  | date = Summer 1989 | ref = harv | postscript = .| doi-broken-date = 2018-07-31 }} [https://www.academia.edu/18709632/Relating_to_privilege_Seduction_and_rejection_in_the_subordination_of_white_women_and_women_of_color|doi=10.1086/494546 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some women of color are subordinated through rejection, or denial of the "patriarchal invitation to privilege".&lt;ref name="F&amp;W_Accomplish"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fenstermaker | first1 = Sarah | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Power, inequality, and the accomplishment of gender: an ethnomethodological view | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&amp;pg=PR5 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | page = 52 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, some white men may see women of color as workers and objects of sexual aggression; this would allow the men to display power and sexual aggression without the emotional attachment that they have with white women. White women are accountable for their gendered display as traditionally subservient to white men while women of color may be held accountable for their gendered performance as sexual objects and as [[wikt:recalcitrant|recalcitrant]] and [[wikt:bawdy|bawdy]] women in relations with white men. West and Fenstermaker conclude that doing gender involves different versions of accountability, depending on women's "relational position" to white men.&lt;ref name="F&amp;W_Accomplish" /&gt;

====Gender as accomplishment====

Gender, according to West and Zimmerman, is not simply what one is, but what one does – it is actively produced within social interactions. Gender is an accomplishment : "the activity of managing situated conduct in light of normative conceptions of attitudes and activities appropriate for one's sex category".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt;{{rp|127}} People do not have to be in mixed gender groups or in groups at all for the performance of gender to occur; the production of gender occurs with others and is even performed alone, in the imagined presence of others. [[Doing gender|"Doing" gender]] is not just about conforming to stereotypical gender roles – it is the active engagement in any behavior that is gendered, or behavior that may be evaluated as gendered.

The performance of gender varies given the context: time, space, social interaction, etc. The enactment of gender roles is context dependent – roles  are "situated identities" instead of "master identities".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt;{{rp|131}} The sociology of knowledge must first of all concern itself with what people "know" as "reality" in their everyday, non- or pre-theoretical lives. In other words, individual perceptions of ""knowledge" or reality...must be the central focus."&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt;

These performances normalize the essentialism of sex categories. In other words, by doing gender, we reinforce the essential categories of gender – that there are only two categories that are mutually exclusive. The idea that men and women are essentially different is what makes men and women behave in ways that appear essentially different. Though sex categorization is based on biological sex, it is maintained as a category through socially constructed displays of gender (for example, you could identify a transgender person as female when in fact she is assigned male at birth).

Institutions also create normative conceptions of gender. In other words, gender is simultaneously created and maintained – "both a process and a product, medium and outcome of such power relations".&lt;ref name="Mumby"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mumby | first = Dennis K. | title = Organizing men: power, discourse, and the social construction of masculinity(s) in the workplace | journal = [[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 164&amp;ndash;183, 169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2885.1998.tb00216.x | date = May 1998 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his examination of blue and white-collar workers, Mumby&lt;ref name="Mumby"/&gt; argued that hegemonic or dominant masculinity provides a standard of acceptable behavior for men, and at the same time, is the product of men's behavior. This can be said for constructions of any identity in certain contexts (e.g. femininity, race, Black femininity, etc.).

====Accountability====

People hold themselves and each other accountable for their presentations of gender (how they 'measure up'). They are aware that others may evaluate and characterize their behavior. This is an interactional process (not just an individual one). Social constructionism asserts that gender is a category that people evaluate as omnirelevant to social life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Garfinkel | first = Harold | title = Studies in ethnomethodology | publisher = Prentice-Hall | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey | origyear = 1967 | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780745600055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender as omnirelevant means that people can always be judged by what they do as a man or as a woman. This is the basis for the reasoning that people are always performing gender and that gender is always relevant in social situations.

Accountability can apply to behaviors that do conform to cultural conceptions as well as those behaviors that deviate – it is the ''possibility'' of being held accountable that is important in social constructionism. For example, Stobbe examined the rationale that people gave for why there were small numbers of women in the auto industry. Men cited the idea that such dirty work was unsuitable for women and women were unable to train because of family duties. Stobbe argues that the male workers created a [[machismo]] masculinity to distinguish themselves from women who might have been qualified to work in the auto shop. Women who do work in male-dominated professions have to carefully maintain and simultaneously balance their femininity and professional credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00265.x |title=Doing Machismo: Legitimating Speech Acts as a Selection Discourse |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=105–123 |year=2005 |last1=Stobbe |first1=Lineke |url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/33804/1/178738.pdf |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00263.x |title=The Third Sex: Women Leaders in Australian Agriculture |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |pages=73–88 |year=2005 |last1=Pini |first1=Barbara }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/0959353505051728 |title=Making Sense of Gender, Age, Power and Disciplinary Position: Intersecting Discourses in the Academy |journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=189–208 |year=2016 |last1=Søndergaard |first1=Dorte Marie }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though gender seems more salient in some situations – for instance, when a woman enters a male-dominated profession – gender categories also become salient in contexts in which gender is less obvious. For instance, gender is maintained before the woman enters the male-dominated group through conceptions of masculinity.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt;{{rp|128–129}}

Race, class, and other oppressions can also be omnirelevant categories, though they are not ''all'' identically salient in every set of social relationships in which inequality is done. People have preconceived notions about what particular racial groups look like (although there is no biological component to this categorization). Accountability is interactional because it does not occur solely within the individual. It is also institutional because individuals may be held accountable for their behaviors by institutions or by others in social situations, as a member of any social group (gender, race, class, etc.).&lt;ref name="F&amp;W_Institutional" /&gt;{{rp|96}} This notion of accountability makes gender dynamic because what is considered appropriate behavior for men and women changes and is reproduced over time and is reproduced differently depending on context. Gender is created in different ways among uneducated and educated African Americans.&lt;ref name="Deutsch"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/0891243206293577 |title=Undoing Gender |journal=Gender &amp; Society |volume=21 |pages=106–127 |year=2016 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Francine M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex and sex category===

West and Zimmerman give this definition for sex in their paper ''Doing Gender'': "Sex is a determination made through the application of socially agreed upon biological criteria for classifying persons as females and males. The criteria for classification can be genitalia at birth or chromosomal typing before birth, and they do not necessarily agree with one another".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt; The differentiation between gender and sex did not arise until the late 1970s, when researchers began using "gender" and "sex" as two separate terms, with "gender" referring to one's self-identity and "sex" referring to one's chromosomal makeup and sex organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = DeFrancisco | first1 = Victoria Pruin | last2 = Palczewski | first2 = Catherine Helen | chapter = Developing a critical gender/sex lens | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xbGNAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 | title = Gender in communication: a critical introduction | page = 11 | publisher = Sage Publications, Inc. | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2014 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781452220093 }}

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] addresses the issues facing intersex people in her article ''The Five Sexes''. She claims that there is at minimum five sexes but probably more; this is based on the vast range of ways bodies show up in nature. She points out that, "recent advances in physiology and surgical technology now enable physicians to catch most intersexuals at birth...infants are entered into a program of hormonal and surgical management..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fausto-Sterling | first = Anne | author-link = Anne Fausto-Sterling | title = The five sexes: why male and female are not enough | journal = [[The Sciences]] | pages = 20&amp;ndash;24 | doi = 10.1002/j.2326-1951.1993.tb03081.x | date = March–April 1993 | url = http://capone.mtsu.edu/phollowa/5sexes.html | ref = harv | postscript = . | volume=33| issue = 2 }} [http://www.fd.unl.pt/docentes_docs/ma/TPB_MA_5937.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; This highlights the intense adherence to the binary instead of allowing bodies to present in the world without intervention.

West and Zimmerman also give a definition for sex category: "achieved through application of the sex criteria, but in everyday life, categorization is established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one's membership in one or the other category".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt; Sex category is applied to a person in everyday life through commonly recognized cues that are not necessarily fulfilling biological criteria of sex.

==Applications of gender performance==

The term "gender performativity" was first coined in American philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]]'s 1990 book ''[[Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith|authorlink=Judith Butler | chapter = Subversive bodily acts, IV Bodily Inscriptions, Performative Subversions | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity |page=179 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York |origyear=1990 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415924993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Gender Trouble'', Butler sets out to criticize what she considers to be an outdated perception of gender. This outdated perception, according to Butler, is limiting in that it adheres to the dominant societal constraints that label gender as binary. In scrutinizing gender, Butler introduces a nuanced perception in which she unites the concepts of performativity and gender. In chapter one of the text, Butler introduces the unification of the terms gender and performativity in stating that "gender proves to be performance—that is, constituting the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to pre-exist the deed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith|authorlink=Judith Butler  | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity |page=25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York |origyear=1990 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415924993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In demystifying this concept, Butler sets out to clarify that there is indeed a difference in the terms gender performance and gender performativity. In doing so, Butler states in an interview: "When we say that gender is performed, we usually mean that we've taken on a role; we're acting in some way…To say that gender is performative is a little different…For something to be performative means that it produces a series of effects. We act and walk and speak and talk that consolidate an impression of being a man or being a woman…we act as if that being of a man or that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or simply something that is true about us. Actually, it is a phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Judith Butler]] | date= 6 June 2011 |accessdate= 22 June 2016 | title= Judith Butler: Your Behavior Creates Your Gender | medium= Video | publisher= [[Big Think]] via [[YouTube]] | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7o2LYATDc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Butler perceives gender as being constructed through a set of acts that are said to be in compliance with dominant societal norms. Butler is, however, not stating that gender is a sort of performance in which an individual can terminate the act; instead, what Butler is stating is that this performance is ongoing and out of an individual's control. In fact, rather than an individual producing the performance, the opposite is true. The performance is what produces the individual. Specifically, Butler states that "there is no 'being' behind doing… 'the doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed – the deed is everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = 25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780415389556 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the emphasis is placed not on the individual producing the deed but on the deed itself. Although a seemingly difficult concept to grasp, gender performativity is realized throughout many aspects of our lives, specifically in our infancy and young childhood, our teen years, and finally our adult lives.

On Butler's hypothesis, the socially constructed aspect of gender performativity is perhaps most obvious in [[Drag (clothing)#Drag kings and queens|drag]] performance, which offers a rudimentary understanding of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] in its emphasis on gender performance. Butler understands drag cannot be regarded as an example of subjective or singular identity, where "there is a 'one' who is prior to gender, a one who goes to the wardrobe of gender decides with deliberation which gender it will be today".&lt;ref name="GLQ_Butler"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Critically queer | journal = [[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 17&amp;ndash;32 | doi = 10.1215/10642684-1-1-17 | date = November 1993 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} Consequently, drag should not be considered the honest expression of its performer's intent. Rather, Butler suggests that what is performed "can only be understood through reference to what is barred from the signifier within the domain of corporeal legibility".&lt;ref name="GLQ_Butler" /&gt;{{rp|24}}

[[Amelia Jones]] proposes that this mode of viewing gender offered a way to move beyond the theories of the [[gaze]] and [[sexual fetishism]], which had attained much prominence in academic feminism, but which by the 1980s Jones viewed as outdated methods of understanding women's societal status. Jones believes the performative power to act out gender is extremely useful as a framework, offering new ways to consider images as enactments with embodied subjects rather than inanimate objects for men's viewing pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Jones | editor-first = Amelia | editor-link = Amelia Jones | title = The feminism and visual culture reader | page = 370 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415267069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infancy and young childhood===

The idea around gender performativity, when applied to infancy and young childhood, deals with the idea that from the moment one is conceived, arguably even before that, who they are and who they will become is predetermined. Children learn at a very young age what it means to be a boy or girl in our society. Individuals are either given masculine or feminine names based on their sex, are assigned colors that are deemed appropriate only when utilized by a particular sex and are even given toys that will aid them in recognizing their proper places in society. According to Barbara Kerr and Karen Multon, many parents would be puzzled to know "the tendency of little children to think that it is their clothing or toys that make them boy or girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kerr | first1 = Barbara A. | last2 = Multon | first2 = Karen D. | title = The development of gender identity, gender roles, and gender relations in gifted students | journal = [[Journal of Counseling &amp; Development]] | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | page = 183 | doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6676.2015.00194.x | date = April 2015 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents are going as far as coordinating their daughter with the color pink because it's feminine, or blue for their son because it's masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Witt |first1=Susan D. |title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles |url=http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm |accessdate=16 July 2018 |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing these points, Penelope Eckert, in her text titled ''Language and Gender'', states: "the first thing people want to know about a baby is its sex, and social convention provides a myriad of props to reduce the necessity of asking".&lt;ref name="Language and Gender"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Eckert | first1 = Penelope | last2 = McConnell-Ginet | first2 = Sally | title = Language and gender | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2013 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781107659360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this reinforces the importance and emphasis that society places not only on sex but also on ways in which to point towards one's sex without implicitly doing so. Eckert furthers this in stating that determining sex at one's birth is also vital of how one presents themselves in society at an older age because "sex determination sets the stage for a lifelong process of gendering".&lt;ref name="Language and Gender"/&gt; Eckert's statement points to Judith Butler's view of gender as being performative. Similar to Butler, Eckert is hinting to the fact that gender is not an internal reality that cannot be changed. What Eckert is instead stating is that this is a common misconception that a majority of the population unknowingly reinforces, which sees its emergence during infancy.

Butler suggests in both "Critically Queer" and "Melancholy Gender",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | authorlink = Judith Butler | title = The psychic life of power: theories in subjection | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = Stanford, California | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780804728126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the child/subject's ability to grieve the loss of the same-sex parent as a viable love object is barred. Following from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s notion of [[melancholia]], such a repudiation results in a heightened identification with the Other that cannot be loved, resulting in gender performances which create allegories of, and internalize the lost love that the subject is subsequently unable to acknowledge or grieve. Butler explains that "a masculine gender is formed from the refusal to grieve the masculine as a possibility of love; a feminine gender is formed (taken on, assumed) through the fantasy which the feminine is excluded as a possible object of love, an exclusion never grieved, but 'preserved' through the heightening of feminine identification itself".&lt;ref name="GLQ_Butler" /&gt;{{rp|25}}

===Teen years===

One's teen years are the prime time in which socialization occurs as well as the time in which how one presents themselves in society is of high concern. Often, this is the time in which one's ability to master their gender performance labels them as successful, and thus normal, or unsuccessful, and thus strange and unfitting. One of the sources that demonstrate how successful performance is acted out is magazines, specifically magazines targeting young girls. According to Eckert, "When we are teenagers, the teen magazines told girls how to make conversation with boys…".&lt;ref name="Language and Gender" /&gt;{{rp|275}} This not only emphasizes the fact that gender is something that is taught to us and is continuously being shaped by society's expectations, but it also points to one of the ways in which individuals are being subconsciously trained to be ideal participants in the gender binary. Thus calling back to Butler's perception that gender is not a fact about us but is something that is taught to us and is being constantly reinforced. This idea that gender is constantly shaped by expectations is relevant in the online community. Teenagers are easily able to formulate relationships and friendships online, thus increasing the probability of a teenager's delicate identity to be manipulated and distorted. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valkenburg|first=Patti M.|last2=Peter|first2=Jochen|date=February 2011|title=Online Communication Among Adolescents: An Integrated Model of Its Attraction, Opportunities, and Risks|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.08.020|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=48|issue=2|pages=121–127|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.08.020|issn=1054-139X}}&lt;/ref&gt;Teenagers often come across situations in real life and online that cause them to question themselves when facing society, including gender performance.

=== Queer Identity ===
The Butlerian model presents a queer perspective on gender performance and explores the possible intersection between socially constructed gender roles and compulsory heterosexuality. This model diverges from the hegemonic analytical framework of gender that many claim as heteronormative, contending with the ways in which queer actors problematize the traditional construction of gender. Butler adapts the psychoanalytical term of melancholia to conceptualize homoerotic subtext as it exists in western literature and especially the relationship between women writers, their gender, and their sexuality. Melancholia deals with mourning, but for homosexual couples it is not just mourning the death of the relationship, instead it is the societal disavowal of the relationship itself and the ability to mourn, thus leading to repression of these feelings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McIvor|first=David W.|date=2012|title=Bringing Ourselves to Grief: Judith Butler and the Politics of Mourning|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41703076?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Political Theory|volume=40|issue=4|pages=409-436|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This idea is reflected in the activism of organized by political groups such as [[ACT UP]] during the AIDS crisis. Many of the survivors that participated in this activism were homosexuals whom has lost their partners to the disease. The survivors commemorated the dead by quilting together their rags, repurposing their possessions, and displaying their own bodies for premature mourning. All of these protests amounted to a message that some part of them will be left in the world after they have expired&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Julia|date=Fall 1992|title=AIDS, Stigma, and Narratives of Containment|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26304009|journal=American Imago|volume=49|issue=3|pages=293-310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Queer Failure is a concept in queer theory that also calls gender into question, because it examines queer art and the bodies of LGBTQ+ people through the lens of what a parental figure may identify as "failure" on the part of their character. Instead of recognizing these instances as moral or psychological failures, this concept frames them as the resultants of a conflict between a person's sexuality and their gender&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takemoto|first=Tina|date=Spring 2016|title=Queer Art / Queer Failure|url=|journal=Art Journal|volume=75|issue=1|pages=85-88|doi=10.1080/00043249.2016.1171547|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Political potential and limits ===
Butler suggests that "[t]he critical promise of drag does not have to do with the proliferation of genders…but rather with the exposure of the failure of heterosexual regimes ever fully to legislate or contain their own ideals", although such remarks fail to indicate how the inadequacies of heterosexual regimes might be explicitly exposed.&lt;ref name="GLQ_Butler" /&gt;{{rp|26}} {{failed verification|date=October 2015}}{{Original research inline|date=October 2015}}

According to Butler, gender performance is only subversive because it is "the kind of effect that resists calculation", which is to say that signification is [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicitous]], that the subject is unable to control it, and so subversion is always occurring and always unpredictable.&lt;ref name="GLQ_Butler" /&gt;{{rp|29}} Moya Lloyd suggests that the political potential of gender performances can be evaluated relative to similar past acts in similar contexts in order to assess their transgressive potential: "Even if we accept that there are incalculable effects to all (or most) statements or activities, this does not mean that we need to concede that there are no calculable effects."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lloyd | first = Moya | authorlink = Moya Lloyd | title = Performativity, parody, politics | journal = [[Theory, Culture &amp; Society]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | page = 207 | doi = 10.1177/02632769922050476 | date = April 1999 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Rosalyn Diprose]] lends a hard-line [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] interpretation to her understanding of gender performance's political reach, as one's identity "is built on the invasion of the self by the gestures of others, who, by referring to other others, are already social beings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diprose | first = Rosalyn | authorlink = Rosalyn Diprose | title = The bodies of women: ethics, embodiment, and sexual difference | page = 25 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780415097833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diprose implies that the individual's will, and the individual performance, is always subject to the dominant discourse of an Other (or Others), so as to restrict the transgressive potential of performance to the inscription of simply another dominant discourse.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[Martha Nussbaum]] criticizes Butler's concepts of gender performativity as a misguided retreat from engaging with real-world concerns:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nussbaum |first=Martha C. | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | title = The professor of parody | journal = [[The New Republic]] | url = http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Nussbaum-Butler-Critique-NR-2-99.pdf | date = 22 February 1999 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Butler suggests to her readers that this sly send-up of the ''status quo'' is the only script for resistance that life offers [...] Butlerian feminism is in many ways easier than the old feminism. It tells scores of talented young women that they need not work on changing the law, or feeding the hungry, or assailing power through theory harnessed to material politics. They can do politics in safety of their campuses, remaining on the symbolic level, making subversive gestures at power through speech and gesture. This, the theory says, is pretty much all that is available to us anyway, by way of political action, and isn't it exciting and sexy?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==During development==
Gender features strongly in most societies and is a significant aspect of self-definition for most people.&lt;ref name="Springer New York"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bussey | first = Kay | chapter = Gender identity development | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LkREWoAUrAUC&amp;pg=PA602 | editor1-last = Schwartz | editor1-first = Seth J. | editor2-last = Luyckx | editor2-first = Koen | editor3-last = Vignoles | editor3-first = Vivian L. | title = Handbook of identity theory and research |page=603 | publisher = Springer | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781441979889 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way to analyze the social influences that affect the development of gender is through the perspective of the social cognitive theory. According to Kay Bussey, social cognitive theory describes "how gender conceptions are developed and transformed across the life span".&lt;ref name="Springer New York"/&gt; The social cognitive theory views gender roles as socially constructed ideas that are obtained over one's entire lifetime. These gender roles are "repeatedly reinforced through socialization".&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackman|first=Heather W. | chapter = Chapter 5, Sexism: Introduction | chapter-url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/818464801 | editor1-last = Adams | editor1-first = Maurianne | editor2-last = et al | title = Readings for diversity and social justice | page = 318 | publisher = Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group | location = New York | year = 2013 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9780415892940 }} Preview of [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xltVgiCSFaUC&amp;pg=PA199 earlier edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; Hackman verifies that these gender roles are instilled in us from "the moment we are born".&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; For the individual, gender construction starts with assignments to a sex category on the basis of biological genitalia at birth.&lt;ref name="Lorber1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorber|first=Judith | chapter = Chapter 5, Sexism: 'Night to his day': the social construction of gender | chapter-url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/818464801 | editor1-last = Adams | editor1-first = Maurianne | editor2-last = et al | title = Readings for diversity and social justice | page = 324 | publisher = Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group | location = New York | year = 2013 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9780415892940 }} Preview of [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xltVgiCSFaUC&amp;pg=PA204 earlier edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; Following this sexual assignment, parents begin to influence gender identity by dressing children in ways that clearly display this biological category.

===Gender-based harassment===
In high schools, gender-based harassment serves as a form of gender boundary policing. Girls are expected to conform to stereotypical gendered appearances, as are boys. Both male and female students regularly take part in policing gender boundaries through [[bullying]]. Male students frequently harass male and female students, while female students generally only harass other female students. The practice of male students bullying other male students is explicitly linked to [[machismo]] that boys are expected to subscribe to in order to be constructed and related to as 'normal' boys.&lt;ref name="Martino"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Martino | first1 = Wayne | last2 = Pallota-Chiarollo | first2 = Maria | title = Being normal is the only way to be: adolescent perspectives on gender and school | publisher = UNSW Press | location = Sydney, NSW | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780868407708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many girls report that boys tease and ridicule them on the basis of their appearance, which is linked to boys asserting masculine power through sexist practices of denigrating girls.&lt;ref name="Martino" /&gt; This also serves to perpetuate the idea that appearance is a female's most important asset. The way in which girls harass other girls is through gossiping, instead of confronting the other girls directly. Unique appearances and attempts to stand out among girls are regarded very negatively.&lt;ref name="Eder"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eder | first = Donna | title = School talk: gender and adolescent culture | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780813521794 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of female on female bullying sets the standard for appearance norms and the importance of appearance for females. Overall, gender-based harassment serves to define and enforce gender boundaries of high school students by high school students.

===Adolescent view of adulthood===

Gender is a [[cultural]] construction which creates an environment where an adolescent's performance in high school is related to their life goals and expectations. Because some young women believe that they want to be mothers and wives, the choice of professions and future goals can be inherently flawed by the gender constraints.  Because a girl may want to be a mother later, her academics in high school can create clear [[gender difference]]s because "higher occupational expectations, educational expectations, and academic grades were more strongly associated with the expected age of parenthood for girls than for boys".&lt;ref name="Crockett, Lisa J. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crockett | first1 = Lisa J. | last2 = Beal | first2 = Sarah J. | title = The life course in the making: gender and the development of adolescents' expected timing of adult role transitions | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 1727&amp;ndash;1738 | doi = 10.1037/a0027538 | pmid = 22448985 | date = November 2012 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; With "young women recognizing potential conflicts between the demands of work and family", they will not try as hard in high school allowing males to achieve higher academic achievement then girls. Crocket and Beal in their article "The Life Course in the Making: Gender and the Development of Adolescents", "gender differences in the anticipated timing of future role transitions, the impact of expectations and values on these  expected timings, and the extent to which expectations foreshadow actual behavior".&lt;ref name="Crockett, Lisa J. 2012"/&gt; The actions of a youth in high school greatly impact the choices the individual will have over a lifetime. Women especially are constrained in the way they view their adulthood even at a young age because of [[motherhood]].

Males can also be subject to gender construction due to social expectations of masculinity. According to [[Jack Halberstam]] (under the name Judith), people correlate masculinity with "maleness and to power to domination”, something that he believes is a result of patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Halberstam | first = Judith | title = Female masculinity | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 1998 |language=en |url=http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/gustafson/FILM%20165A.W11/film%20165A%5BW11%5D%20readings%20/halbertsammasculinity.pdf | isbn = 9780822322436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 study published in the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', researchers stated that gender construct can differ depending on the man's race or ethnicity and stated that for white men there was an emphasis on "education,employment, and socioeconomic status" whereas the expectations for black men focused on "sexual prowess, physical dominance, and gamesmanship”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fields |first=Errol Lamont |last2=Bogart |first2=Laura M. |last3=Smith |first3=Katherine C. |last4=Malebranche |first4=David J. |last5=Ellen |first5=Jonathan |last6=Schuster |first6=Mark A. | title = "I always felt I had to prove my manhood": homosexuality, masculinity, gender role strain, and HIV risk among young Black men who have sex with men | journal = [[American Journal of Public Health]] | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 122&amp;ndash;131 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2013.301866 | pmid = 24832150 | date = January 2015 | ref = harv | postscript = . | pmc=4265897}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expectations can make it harder for males to display emotions without receiving criticism and being seen as less of a man.

Adolescents view on [[adulthood]] is also determined by their employment in high school. Many boys work during high school and "unlike young women, young men who had not worked during high school did not quite match their peers".&lt;ref name="Mortimer 2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mortimer | first = Jeylan | title = Working and growing up in America | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780674016149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because many other boys are working, those who don't work may not be as successful after graduation.  In the book ''Working and Growing Up in America'', Jeylan T. Mortimer explains "youth who work during high school, and those who devote more hours to work, are more [[vocation]]ally successful after leaving high school".&lt;ref name="Mortimer 2005" /&gt; This creates a distinct gender difference in which men are more likely to be employed after high school than women if they have worked during high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Marsh | first = Herbert W. | title = Employment during high school: character building or a subversion of academic goals? | journal = [[Sociology of Education (journal)|Sociology of Education]] | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 172&amp;ndash;189 | doi = 10.2307/2112850 | jstor = 2112850 | date = July 1991 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means women may be at an academic advantage if they do not work in high school and focus on school work.

===Depression===

High school continues to become a more high-pressure environment with academic and social triggers increasing the expectations of adolescents. High school is a large transitional period for teenagers causing them to "cope with these various transitions in different ways; some negotiate the passages easily whereas others develop serious behavioral and psychological problems".&lt;ref name="Negriff, Sonya 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Negriff | first1 = Sonya | last2 = Susman | first2 = Elizabeth J. | title = Pubertal timing, depression, and externalizing problems: a framework, review, and examination of gender differences | journal = [[Journal of Research on Adolescence]] | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 717&amp;ndash;746 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00708.x | date = September 2011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these psychological problems is [[Depression (mood)|depression]].  While the environment of high school can be stressful biological functions also play a large role is [[psychological well-being]]. Negriff and  Susman explain in their article "Pubertal Timing, Depression, and Externalizing Problems" that "the same [[hormone]]s that increase during [[puberty]] are also related to depression and aggressive tendencies. Higher levels of [[testosterone]] are associated with increased [[aggression]] in boys and girls, whereas higher [[estrogen]] for girls is associated with increased depressive symptoms".&lt;ref name="Negriff, Sonya 2011"/&gt; The gender differences observed may not just be due to the cultural expectations, but rather a biological function of the sex the individuals are born with. Self-esteem has also been linked to depression in high school students. One study done by James Battle in 1980 took 26 student ages 15–18 showed a correlation between depression and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Battle"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Battle | first = James | title = Relationship between self-esteem and depression among high school students | journal = [[Perceptual and Motor Skills]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 157&amp;ndash;158 | doi = 10.2466/pms.1980.51.1.157 | pmid = 7432952 | date = June 1980 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 80s, research had not looked past adults and Battle's research was some of the first of its kind which showed a direct correlation between self-esteem and depression.&lt;ref name="Battle" /&gt; [[Self-esteem]] is not a product of our biology but rather is culturally constructed.&lt;ref name="Battle" /&gt; Girls in high school also tend to have lower self-esteem due to body image.&lt;ref name="Gram 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = Melody A. | last2 = Eich | first2 = Carla | last3 = Kephart | first3 = Becky | last4 = Peterson | first4 = Dawn | title = Relationship among body image, sex, and popularity of high school students | journal = [[Perceptual and Motor Skills]] | volume = 90 | issue = 3s | pages = 1187&amp;ndash;1193 | doi = 10.2466/pms.2000.90.3c.1187 | pmid = 10939068 | date = June 2000 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; With depression and self-esteem being so closely linked the potential for having the disease can result in an educational experience which can be compromised. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] can be isolating, and without proper academics and societal support, high school can be challenging. Along with higher rates of [[self-esteem]] issues in adolescents, this can adversely affect girls' academics and social life in high school.

===Body image===

High school is a major transitional period for girls and boys as their bodies transition into men and women. The end of high school is usually marked by the 18th birthday, a major milestone in an individual's life. Boys and girls go through this transformation within high school where each gender faces body satisfaction differently. There are many different factors that affect [[body image]], "including [[sex]], [[mass media|media]], parental relationship, and [[puberty]] as well as weight and popularity".&lt;ref name="Gram 2000"/&gt; The [[intersectionality]] of these factors causes unique experiences for adolescents during this period within their lives. As their body changes, so does the environment in which they live in. Body image is closely linked to [[psychological well-being]] during adolescence and can cause harmful effects when a child has body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref name="Winefield"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Delfabbro | first1 = Paul H. | last2 = Winefield | first2 = Anthony H. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = Sarah | last4 = Hammarström | first4 = Anne | last5 = Winefield | first5 = Helen | title = Body image and psychological well-being in adolescents: the relationship between gender and school type | journal = [[The Journal of Genetic Psychology]] | volume = 172 | issue = 1 | pages = 67&amp;ndash;83 | doi = 10.1080/00221325.2010.517812 | pmid = 21452753 | date = 2011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Winfield in her article "Body Image and Psychological Well-Being in Adolescents: The Relationship between Gender and School Type" explains an adolescences high school experience is closely linked to their perceived [[body image]]. She analyzed over 336 teenagers and found "ratings of [[physical attractiveness]] and body image remain relatively stable across the early teenage years, but become increasingly negative around age 15–18 years because of pubertal changes".&lt;ref name="Winefield" /&gt; This shift during the high school years can cause serious psychological problems for adolescence.  These psychological problems can manifest as [[bulimia]] and [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] causing serious lifelong problems.&lt;ref name="Winefield" /&gt; These body image issues are especially prevalent in girls but as boys enter [[puberty]] expectations of height and muscle mass change as well.  Geoffrey H. Cohane, Harrison G. Pope Jr. in their article "Body image in boys: A review of the literature" argue "girls typically wanted to be thinner, boys frequently wanted to be bigger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohane | first1 = Geoffrey H. | last2 = Pope | first2 =  Harrison G. | title = Body image in boys: A review of the literature | journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 373&amp;ndash;379 | doi = 10.1002/eat.1033 | pmid = 11285574 | date = May 2001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, they argue, shows the gender difference in body image cause different beauty ideals. An adolescent's gender affects their body image and their high school experience.

===Education===
{{See also|Sex and psychology#Mathematics}}
Due to the amount of time that children spend in school, "teachers are influential role models for many aspects of children's educational experiences, including gender socialization".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Garrahy | first = Deborah A. | title = Three third-grade teachers' gender-related beliefs and behavior | journal = [[Elementary School Journal|The Elementary School Journal]] | volume = 102 | issue = 1 | pages = 81&amp;ndash;94 | doi = 10.1086/499694 | jstor = 1002170 | date = September 2001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers who endorse the culturally dominant gender-role stereotype regarding the distribution of talent between males and females distort their perception of their students' mathematical abilities and effort resources in mathematics, in a manner that is consistent with their gender-role stereotype and to a greater extent than teachers who do not endorse the stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tiedemann | first = Joachim | title = Teachers' gender stereotypes as determinants of teacher perceptions in elementary school mathematics | journal = [[Educational Studies in Mathematics]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&amp;ndash;62 | doi = 10.1023/A:1020518104346 | jstor = 3483051 | date = May 2002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1994 report ''[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]'' by the [[American Psychological Association]], "[m]ost standard tests of intelligence have been constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males." Differences have been found, however, in specific areas such as mathematics and verbal measures.&lt;ref name="lrainc.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neisser | first1 = Ulric | last2 = et al | title = Intelligence: knowns and unknowns | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 77&amp;ndash;101 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77 | date = February 1996 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even within mathematics, it is noted that significant differences in performance as a result of gender do not occur until late in high school, a result of [[Sex differences in humans|biological differences]], the exhibition of stereotypes by teachers, and the difference in chosen coursework between individual students.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Leahey | first1 = Erin | last2 = Guo | first2 = Guang | title = Gender differences in mathematical trajectories | journal = [[Social Forces]] | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 713&amp;ndash;732 | doi = 10.1353/sof.2001.0102 | jstor = 2675595 | date = December 2001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; While, on average, boys and girls perform similarly in math, boys are over represented among the very best performers as well as the very worst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Winstein | first = Keith J. | title = Boys' math scores hit highs and lows | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121691806472381521 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | location = New York | date = July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benbow | first1 = Camilla Persson | last2 = Lubinski | first2 = David | last3 = Shea | first3 = Daniel L. | last4 = Eftekhari-Sanjani | first4 = Hossain | title = Sex differences in mathematical reasoning ability at age 13: their status 20 years later | journal = [[Psychological Science]] | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 474&amp;ndash;480 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00291 | date = November 2000 | ref = harv | postscript = .| url = https://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/ps/math_20years.pdf | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers have found that when certain types of teaching (such as experiments that reflect daily life), work for girls, they generally work for boys as well.&lt;ref name="Campbell and McGee-Bailey"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = McGee Bailey | first1 = Susan | last2 = Campbell | first2 = Patricia B. | chapter = The gender wars in education | chapterurl = http://www.campbell-kibler.com/Gender_Wars.htm | title = Research and action report | publisher = Wellesley Centers for Women | location = Wellesley, Massachusetts |date=February 9, 1999 | id = 1999/2(X)0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although little difference in mathematics performance was found among younger students, a study of students grade 1-3 by Fennema et al. noted that significant differences in problem-solving strategies were found, with girls tending to use more standard [[algorithm]]s than the boys.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fennema | first1 = Elizabeth | last2 = Carpenter | first2 = Thomas P. | last3 = Jacobs | first3 = Victoria R. | last4 = Franke | first4 = Megan L. | last5 = Levi | first5 = Linda W. | title = New perspectives on gender differences in mathematics: a reprise | journal = [[Educational Researcher]] | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 19&amp;ndash;21 | doi = 10.3102/0013189x027005019 | jstor = 1176737 | date = July 1998 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that this may be due to both the teachers' stereotypical beliefs about mathematics and gender, as well as the study's design permitting "the children's stereotypical beliefs to influence strategy use and thus the development of understanding in these classrooms".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A study conducted at Illinois State University examined the effects of gender stereotypes on the teaching practices of three third grade teachers, noting that "[the teachers] claimed [[gender neutrality]], yet they expressed numerous beliefs about gender difference during the study", such as allowing boys (but not girls) to respond to questions without raising their hand or providing reading selections that promoted women in non-traditional roles, but not doing the same for men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Overall, differences in student performance that arise from gender tend to be smaller than that of other [[Demography|demographic]] differences, such as race or [[Social class|socioeconomic class]].&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Patricia B. | last2 = Storo | first2 = Jennifer N. | title = Girls are... boys are... : myths, stereotypes &amp; gender differences | publisher = Office of Educational Research and Improvement, U.S. Department of Education / Women's Educational Equity Act Resource Center | location = Newton, Massachusetts | url = http://www.campbell-kibler.com/stereo.pdf | year = 1996 | oclc = 52689711}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the 1992 [[National Assessment of Educational Progress|NAEP]] 12th grade science tests, on a 500-point scale, show that the differences of scores between white and African American students were around 48 points, while differences between male and female students were around 11 points.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;

=== Media ===
Social gender construction (specifically for younger audiences) is also influenced by media. In the 21st century, modern technology is abundant in developed countries. In 2018, roughly 42% of tweens and teens experience feelings of anxiety when not near their phones. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/08/22/how-teens-and-parents-navigate-screen-time-and-device-distractions/|title=How Teens and Parents Navigate Screen Time and Device Distractions {{!}} Pew Research Center|date=2018-08-22|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;There is a growing amount of teens that spend an average of 6.5 hours on media daily. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/8010.pdf|title=Media in the Lives of 8- to 18-Year-Olds|last=Rideout|first=Victoria et al.|date=January 2010|website=Kaiser Family Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;This data reflects how much of a teenager's personality is dependent on media.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Media influencing gender construction can be seen in advertising, social networking, magazines, television, music, and music videos.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

These platforms can affect how a developing human views themselves and those around them. There is both positive and negative media and each type can be perceived differently. &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/entertainment-technology/media/media-influence-on-teens|title=Media influence on teenagers|last=Powell|first=Anastasia|date=12 July 2017|website=Raising Children Network Australia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media will often portray men and women in a stereotypical manner, reflecting their "ideal image" for society. These images often act as an extreme expectation for many developing teenagers.

Men are typically portrayed as assertive, powerful, and strong. Particularly in television, men are usually shown as being nonemotional and detached. Women are often portrayed as the opposite. Gender roles are generally more enforced for women in media than they are for men. Women are typically represented as the backbone of the household, the caretaker, and often even as stay at home mothers. Females in media are often given weak, dependent, and passive personalities. Media presence often perpetuates that men are not allowed to be caring and that women are not allowed to be strong and demanding. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Julia|date=1994|title=Gendered Media: The Influence of Media
on Views of Gender|url=https://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/causes.of.gender.inequality/Readings/Wood%20-%20Gendered%20Media%20-%2094.pdf|journal=Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender, and Culture by Julie|volume=|pages=32|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;These gender influences from the media can mislead a growing child or teenager because while they are still trying to construct their identities and genders in a social environment, they are surrounded by biased influences.

=== Speech ===
Anatomical studies have shown that the larynx of a child, and by extension the fundamental frequency, is likely to vary directly as a result of size and height, rather than sex.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sachs | first1 = Jacqueline | last2 = Lieberman | first2 = Philip | last3 = Erickson | first3 = Donna | chapter = Anatomical and cultural determinants of male and female speech | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HThInAEACAAJ | editor1-last = Fasold | editor1-first = Ralph W. | editor2-last = Shuy | editor2-first = Roger W. | title = Language attitudes: current trends and prospects | pages = 74&amp;ndash;83 | publisher = Georgetown University Press | location = Washington | year = 1973 | oclc = 301750197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sachs et al. suggest that if there is no difference between the size of the articulatory mechanism in children, differences in [[formant]] production between boys and girls may be a result of "culturally determined patterns that are viewed as appropriate for each sex" and a result of the speaker's deliberate phonetic variation in vowel production or changing the configuration of the lips.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Research methods==

Inclusiveness and acceptance play significant roles in social constructionist practice – examples include sharing work with others in a cooperative manner, including a diverse sample, being open to other interpretations of data, and blurring the lines between scientific research, participatory research and social activism.&lt;ref name="Gergen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gergen, M.|year=2001|title=Feminist reconstructions in psychology: Narrative, gender, and performance|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blurring of scientific research also means incorporating other disciplines into psychological work (e.g. performative psychology includes artistic expression or humor) and thinking in terms that go beyond traditional scientific language.&lt;ref name="Gergen"/&gt; These methods are not currently valued in psychology because they are not seen as "scientific."

A social constructionist psychologist can make it explicit that his or her perspective is not universally true in all contexts across historical periods. Social constructionists recognize that every researcher has an opinion and is biased in some way. They acknowledge that their own views and findings/results of a study are open to deconstructive critique – no grand truth can be found because everything is context-specific and has potential to change across time periods and different situations. Related to this is the idea that social constructionists must constantly question their own work because their work can be constantly reinterpreted and have different meanings at different times.&lt;ref name="Gergen"/&gt;

The gender dichotomy is so ingrained that it is impossible for research findings to remain unaffected by it.  People are often convinced that there are inherent differences between men and women, which skews both studies and their findings.  That is, research questions are framed in ways that look for a difference between genders, and thus their methods will be constrained by this framework as well.&lt;ref name="Language and Gender" /&gt; Moreover, the actual outcome of the study, even if the claims are dubious or modest at best, often come to be accepted as facts if they support the gender discourse narrative and are often cited and discussed.  This phenomenon is labeled the "hall of mirrors" effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | title = Gender, language, and discourse: a review essay | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Women in Culture and Society]] | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 945&amp;ndash;973 | doi = 10.1086/495297 | jstor = 3175199 | date = Summer 1998 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fully and accurately record the socialization processes at play regarding gender construction, ethnographic and longitudinal studies are ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Munson | first1 = Benjamin | last2 = Babel | first2 = Molly | title = Loose lips and silver tongues, or, projecting sexual orientation through speech | journal = [[Language and Linguistics Compass]] | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = 416&amp;ndash;449 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-818X.2007.00028.x | date = September 2007 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these methods have their constraints.  It is costly and time consuming to carry out such studies that would yield significant results, and there is an abundance of factors that influence an individual's gender construction.  Thus, more research is needed regarding the social construction of gender.

Research can either be qualitative or quantitative.  Qualitative data is beneficial because it can give a voice to the subjects of the study.  However, poorly-constructed qualitative research can lead to reproduction of race and class biases if findings are inappropriately generalized.&lt;ref name="sage-ereference.com"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Marshall | first1 = Catherine | last2 = Young | first2 = Michelle | chapter = Gender and methodology | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4tVtro6MfksC&amp;pg=PA70 | editor1-last = Skelton | editor1-first = Christine | editor2-last = Francis | editor2-first = Becky | editor3-last = Smulyan | editor3-first = Lisa | title = The Sage handbook of gender and education | page = 70 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781848607996 | doi = 10.4135/9781848607996.n6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, qualitative research methods often involve small, homogeneous samples. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to generalize the findings of a study conducted on a specific group of people and then apply them to all people of that gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weber Cannon | first1 = Lynn | last2 = Higginbotham | first2 = Elizabeth | last3 = Leung | first3 = Marianne L. A. | title = Race and class bias in qualitative research on women | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 449&amp;ndash;462 | doi = 10.1177/089124388002004003 | jstor = 190209 | date = December 1988 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative data is useful when hard data is needed, such as addressing policy issues, when hard data is needed to convince people unfamiliar with the topics.  However, quantitative research can reinforce gender and cultural assumptions as well through item construction.&lt;ref name="sage-ereference.com"/&gt; That is, for data to be quantitatively analysed, they must fit into specific categories.  However, such categories can be based on or at least influenced by gender stereotypes.

==Promoting social change and criticisms==

===Social change===
{{Globalize|section|discuss=Talk:Social construction of gender difference#Globalize|date=June 2016}}
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2016}}
Gender often means adhering to gender normative behavior and roles. The performance of gender reinforces the essentialism of gender categories.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goffman | first = Erving | author-link = Erving Goffman | chapter = The nature of deference and demeanor | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-x0uDwAAQBAJ | title = Interaction ritual: essays in face-to-face behavior | publisher = Routledge, Taylor and Francis Group | location = Abingdon, Oxon New York | origyear = 1967 | year = 2017 | isbn = 9780203788387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentialism argues that there are essential differences between genders which manifest themselves in differences in gender performance. Gender performance consists of a stylized practice involving gestures, language, and speech and serves to form and build an identity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; When an individual performs their gender to the standards set by societal norms, this bolsters the argument of gender essentialism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Performative acts and gender constitution: an essay in phenomenology and feminist theory | journal = [[Theatre Journal]] | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 519&amp;ndash;531 | doi = 10.2307/3207893 | jstor = 3207893 | date = December 1988 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://seas3.elte.hu/coursematerial/TimarAndrea/17a.Butler,performative%5B1%5D.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, men have assumed a dominant gender role, and women have been prescribed a role submissive to men. In order for subordination to go unquestioned, the structure must not appear as a cultural product – it must seem natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Frye | first = Marilyn | title = The politics of reality: essays in feminist theory | publisher = Crossing Press | location = Trumansburg, New York | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780895940995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social movements can challenge the categories that appear "natural." Certain legislation can promote equality for men and women, which could call into question whether there needs to be two categories of gender at all (if both are treated equally). Social change relies on an understanding of how inequality is rooted in gender accomplishment.

Throughout history, women have fought for their rights regarding various issues.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} One of the most significant revolutions of this{{which|date=June 2016}} century is the [[feminist movement]]. The [[First-wave feminism|first wave]], which began in 1854{{where|date=June 2016}}, was a fight for women's rights to education and to the vote by the [[suffragette]]s. This movement was then followed by [[Second-wave feminism]] and [[Third-wave feminism]] which furthered the feminist cause. The feminist movement was not only about fighting for women's rights, but more essentially about earning recognition and respect from the general public acknowledging the fact that they are not inferior than men and thus deserving to be treated equally and granted fair opportunities.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Feminism emerged and started to challenge the idea that a woman's appropriate place was confined to that of the domestic and private sphere. Over time, men and women's attitudes have been becoming more liberalized with regard to gender roles. Men and women are agreeing on a more egalitarian responsibility distribution within the family sphere.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} They are also in agreement that women should and can have roles in the public sphere, especially in leadership positions and that men can have and involved role in the private and domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bolzendahl | first1 = Catherine I. | last2 = Myers | first2 = Daniel J. | title = Feminist attitudes and support for gender equality: opinion change in women and men, 1974-1998 | journal = [[Social Forces]] | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 759&amp;ndash;789 | doi = 10.1353/sof.2005.0005 | jstor = 3598347 | date = December 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://inequality.stanford.edu/printpdf/4595 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; These markers of increasingly liberalized attitudes toward gender roles indicate the trajectory of social change in terms of what is deemed normative.

===Criticism and opportunities to "undo" gender===
{{Further information|Undoing Gender}}
Because the theory says that one can "do" gender whether they conform to gender norms or not (and is always held accountable for behaving in accordance with gender norms), change seems impossible. If essential differences between the sexes are problematic, a society where gender is omnirelevant could be argued to always uphold gender inequality. The language of "doing" gender implies doing difference instead of unraveling it. Most studies that rely on social constructionism explore the ways in which gender is constructed but nevertheless demonstrate how those gender constructions uphold gender as a construct and gender inequality.

However, because gender is "done" or constructed, it can also be "undone" or deconstructed.&lt;ref name="Deutsch"/&gt; The study of the interactional level could expand beyond simply documenting the persistence of inequality to examine: (1) when and how social interactions become less gendered, not just differently gendered, (2) the conditions under which gender is irrelevant in social interactions, (3) whether all gendered interactions reinforce inequality, (4) how the structural (institutional) and interactional levels might work together to produce change, and (5) interaction as the site of change.&lt;ref name="Deutsch"/&gt;

===Nature versus nurture===
{{See also|Gender role#Biological factors}}
Theories that imply that gendered behavior is totally or mostly due to social conventions and culture fall into the nurture end of the [[nature versus nurture]] debate. Much empirical research has been done on to what extent gendered behavior stems from biological factors.

'''Southern [[hospitality]]''' is a phrase used in [[American English]] to describe the [[stereotype]] of residents of the [[Southern United States]] as particularly warm, sweet, and welcoming to visitors to their homes, or to the South in general. The term has engendered some controversy due to the connection of related practices to the culture of [[slavery]], and its continued use during periods of both overt and covert [[racism]], and other forms of [[prejudice]].

==Origins==
Southern hospitality "first existed as a narrowly defined body of social practices among the antebellum planters classes".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Szczesiul, "Re-mapping southern hospitality: discourse, ethics, politics", ''European Journal of American Culture'' (2007), Issue 26, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the origin of the practice was intimately tied to [[slavery in the United States|slavery]].  One analysis notes:

{{quote|African Americans had little place in this initial conceptualization of hospitality beyond the role of servant. Yet, it was the labor and hardships of the enslaved that allowed southern planters to entertain their guests so lavishly and seemingly so effortlessly. Southern hospitality from and for whites was in large part achieved by being inhospitable and inhumane to African Americans.&lt;ref name="Alderman"&gt;Derek H. Alderman and E. Arnold Modlin Jr., "[https://www.academia.edu/2252782/Southern_Hospitality_and_the_Politics_of_African_American_Belonging_An_Analysis_of_Photographs_in_North_Carolina_Tourism_Brochures Southern hospitality and the politics of African American belonging: an analysis of North Carolina tourism brochure photographs]", ''Journal of Cultural Geography'' (December, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Over time, however, the concept "developed into a discourse that stretches far beyond the image of the [[planter class]]", and the principles of Southern hospitality were eventually adopted by African Americans in the South, and incorporated into materials used to advertise destinations in the South to African American tourists.&lt;ref name="Alderman"/&gt; The concept of Southern hospitality has also been examined as a reflection of the deeply held religious beliefs of the region; the idea that one should be good to strangers is an outgrowth of such [[Parables of Jesus|Biblical parable]]s as the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|Good Samaritan]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Szczesiul, ''The Southern Hospitality Myth: Ethics, Politics, Race, and American Memory'' (2017), p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[travel writer]] Ernest Hamlin Abbott wrote in 1902, "as religious observances are in the South as naturally included in the hospitality of the home as anything else, so, conversely, hospitality in the South is an integral part of the church services".&lt;ref name="Abbott1902"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Ernest Hamlin |title=Religious Life in America: A Record of Personal Observation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUcaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR111 |date=1902 |publisher=Outlook Company |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Some characteristics of Southern hospitality were described as early as 1835, when [[Jacob Abbott]] attributed the poor quality of taverns in the South to the lack of need for them, given the willingness of Southerners to provide for strangers.&lt;ref name="Abbott1835"/&gt; Abbott writes:

{{quote|[T]he hospitality of southerners is so profuse, that taverns are but poorly supported. A traveler, with the garb and the manners of a gentleman, finds a welcome at every door. A stranger is riding on horseback through Virginia or Carolina. It is noon. He sees a plantation, surrounded with trees, a little distance from the road. Without hesitation he rides to the door. The gentleman of the house sees his approach and is ready upon the steps.&lt;ref name="Abbott1835"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Jacob |title=New England and her Institutions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m7ETAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR223 |publisher=John Allen |date=1835 |page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Abbott further describes how the best stores of the house are at the disposal of visitors.&lt;ref name="Abbott1835"/&gt; Furthermore, says Abbott:

{{quote|Conversation flows cheeringly, for the southern gentleman has a particular tact in making a guest happy. After dinner you are urged to pass the afternoon and night, and if you are a gentleman in manners and information, your host will be in reality highly gratified by your so doing.&lt;br /&gt;Such is the character of southern hospitality.&lt;ref name="Abbott1835"/&gt;}}

Food figures highly in Southern hospitality, a large component of the idea being the provision of [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern cuisine]] to visitors. A cake or other delicacy is often brought to the door of a new neighbor as a mechanism of introduction. Many club and church functions include a meal or at least a [[dessert]] and beverage. Churches in the South frequently have large commercial style kitchens to accommodate this tradition, but many "fellowship suppers" are "covered dish": everyone attending brings a dish. However, if a newcomer arrives without a dish, he or she will be made to feel welcome and served generously. When a death or serious illness occurs, neighbors, friends, and church members generally bring food to the bereaved family for a period of time. A number of [[cookbooks]] promise [[recipe]]s advancing this concept.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Winifred Green Cheney, ''The Southern Hospitality Cookbook'' (1976) {{ISBN|0-8487-0417-7}}; Sara Pitzer, ''Enjoying the Art of Southern Hospitality: Menus, Recipes, and Suggestions for Entertaining Simply and Graciously'' (1990) {{ISBN|0-87483-121-0}}; Lisette Verlander, Susan Murphy, ''The Cookin' Cajun Cooking School Cookbook'' (1997) {{ISBN|0-87905-784-X}} (stating "I learned to love the tastes and smells of good food, and that true Southern hospitality begins in the kitchen, the soul of a home"); James Villas, ''The Glory of Southern Cooking'' (2007) {{ISBN|0-7645-7601-1}} (discussing "the sacred tradition of preparing and serving lots of good food and drink to large numbers of family, friends, and even strangers — better known as Southern hospitality").&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3160">'''Synergetics coordinates''' is Clifford Nelson's attempt to describe, from another mathematical point of view, [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s '60 degree coordinate system' for understanding nature.  [[Synergetics (Fuller)|Synergetics]] is the word Fuller used to label his approach to [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;
Clifford Nelson, [http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/600/ Buckminster Fuller Notebooks]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric definition==
A [[Theory of forms|system]] of synergetics [[coordinates]] uses only one type of [[simplex]] ([[triangle]], [[tetrahedron]], [[pentachoron]], ..., n-simplex) as [[space]] units, and in fact uses a [[regular simplex]], rather like [[Cartesian coordinates]] use [[hypercubes]] ([[Square (geometry)|square]], [[cube]], [[tesseract]], ..., n-cube.)

[[Image:Synergetics coordinate plane.jpg|right|thumb|Synergetics coordinates in two dimensions]]

The n Synergetics coordinates axes are perpendicular to the n defining geometric objects that define a regular simplex; 2 end points for line segments, 3 lines for triangles, 4 planes for tetrahedrons etc.. The angles between the directions of the coordinate axes are Arc Cosine (-1/(n-1)). The coordinates can be positive or negative or zero and so can their sum. The sum of the n coordinates is the edge length of the regular simplex defined by moving the n  geometric objects in increments of the height of the n-1 dimensional regular simplex that has an edge length of one. If the sum of the n coordinates is negative the triangle (n = 3) or tetrahedron (n = 4) is upside down and inside out.

==Algebraic examples==
Regular [[triangular coordinates]] are in a [[Lattice graph|grid]] of [[equilateral]] triangles and are of the form &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; are equal to or greater than 0.

Regular tetrahedral coordinates are in a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean 3-space]] 'grid' of equilateral tetrahedra and are of the form &lt;math&gt;(w,x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;w,x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; are equal to or greater than 0.

For someone affected by tachypsychia, time perceived by the individual either lengthens, making events appear to slow down, or contracts, objects appearing as moving in a speeding blur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amato |first1=Ivan |title=When Bad Things Happen in Slow Motion |url=http://nautil.us/issue/61/coordinates/when-bad-things-happen-in-slow-motion-rp |accessdate=7 June 2018 |work=[[Nautilus (science magazine)]] |date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that tachypsychia is induced by a combination of high levels of [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]], usually during periods of great physical stress or in violent confrontation.&lt;ref name="pmid18074019"/&gt; Interestingly, a controlled experiment from 2007 suggests the subjective experience of time slowing down is actually an artifact of memory, not an actual trait of real-time perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steton |first1=Chess |last2=et al |title=Does Time Really Slow Down during a Frightening Event? |journal=PLoS ONE |date=12 December 2017 |volume=2 |issue=12 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001295 |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001295}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, newer research seems to contradict this, with results showing that during high stress events a focus on action preparation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hagura, Kanai, Orgs, Haggard |first1=Nobuhiro, Ryota, Guido, Patrick |title=Ready steady slow: action preparation slows the subjective passage of time |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/09/04/rspb.2012.1339 |website=rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org |publisher=The Royal Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; actually does increase information processing, slowing down time perception. A 2012 review of most current research (including the 2007 study) seems to support this as well&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Arstila |first1=Valtteri |title=Time Slows Down during Accidents |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3384265/ |website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |publisher=University of Turku}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Due to the contradictory research results and difficulty of accurately replicating the natural conditions in which the phenomenon occurs, there is still no set consensus on how tachypsychia functions.

==Physical responses==
Also called the "fight or flight" response of the body to an event our mind considers life-threatening, tachypsychia is believed to include numerous physical changes.

===Adrenaline response===
Upon being stimulated by fear or anger, the [[adrenal medulla]] may automatically produce the hormone [[adrenaline]] directly into the blood stream. This can have various effects on various bodily systems, including:
* Increased heart rate and blood pressure. It is common for a tachypsychia subject's pulse to rise to between 200 and 300 [[beats per minute]] (bpm).&lt;ref&gt;Eagleman, D. &amp; Pariyadath, V. (2009). Is subjective duration a signature of coding efficiency? Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B. 364: 1841-1851.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased [[heart rate]] (above 250 bpm) can cause [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]], and the body may adduct all limbs, adopting fetal position, in preparation for a [[coma]].
* Dilation of the [[bronchus|bronchial passages]], permitting higher absorption of oxygen.
* Dilated pupils to allow more light to enter, and visual exclusion—tunnel vision—occurs, allowing greater focus but resulting in the loss of peripheral vision.
* Release of glucose into the bloodstream, generating extra energy by raising the [[blood sugar level]].&lt;ref name="pmid19073237"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gil S, Droit-Volet S | title = Time perception, depression and sadness | journal = Behavioural Processes | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–76 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19073237 | doi = 10.1016/j.beproc.2008.11.012 | url = http://cerca.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/IMG/pdf_BP09-GilColl.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140104031908/http://cerca.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/IMG/pdf_BP09-GilColl.pdf | archivedate = 2014-01-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for an individual to experience [[auditory exclusion]] or sensitivity. It is also common for individuals to experience an increased pain tolerance, loss of color vision, short term memory loss, decreased fine motor skills, decreased communication skills, or decreased coordination.

===Psychological response===
The most common experience during tachypsychia is the feeling that time has either increased or slowed down, brought on by the increased brain activity caused by epinephrine, or the severe decrease in brain activity caused by the "catecholamine washout" occurring after the event. The perception of the duration of an event seems to be modulated by our recent experiences. Humans typically overestimate the perceived duration of the initial event in a stream of identical events&lt;ref name=Rose1995&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rose D, Summers J | title = Duration illusions in a train of visual stimuli | journal = Perception | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 1177–87 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8577576 | doi = 10.1068/p241177 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and unexpected "oddball" stimuli seem to be perceived as longer in duration, relative to expected or frequently presented "standard" stimuli.&lt;ref name=Tse2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tse PU, Intriligator J, Rivest J, Cavanagh P | title = Attention and the subjective expansion of time | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 66 | issue = 7 | pages = 1171–89 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15751474 | doi = 10.3758/BF03196844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oddball effect may serve an evolutionarily adapted "alerting" function and is consistent with reports of time slowing down in threatening situations. The effect seems to be strongest for images that are expanding in size on the retina, in other words, that are "looming" or approaching the viewer,&lt;ref name=Tse2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=New2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = New JJ, Scholl BJ | title = Subjective time dilation: spatially local, object-based, or a global visual experience? | journal = Journal of Vision | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 4.1–11 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19271914 | doi = 10.1167/9.2.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanWassenhove2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Wassenhove V, Buonomano DV, Shimojo S, Shams L | title = Distortions of subjective time perception within and across senses | journal = PLoS One | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = e1437 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18197248 | pmc = 2174530 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0001437 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effect can be eradicated for oddballs that are contracting or perceived to be receding from the viewer.&lt;ref name=New2009/&gt; The effect is also reduced&lt;ref name=Tse2004/&gt; or reversed&lt;ref name=vanWassenhove2008/&gt; with a static oddball presented amongst a stream of expanding stimuli.

It is common for an individual experiencing tachypsychia to have serious misinterpretations of their surroundings during the events, through a combination of their altered perception of time, as well as transient partial [[color blindness]] and [[tunnel vision]]. After the irregularly high levels of adrenaline consumed during sympathetic nervous system activation, an individual may display signs and symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], and it is common for the person to display extreme emotional liability and fatigue, regardless of their actual physical exertion.

==Time dilation==

===Fear and intense events===
[[File:Abraham Diepraam - peasants brawling.jpg|thumb|240px|During violent and threatening situations, people often report that things seem to take longer to happen, such as objects falling more slowly.&lt;ref name="pmid18074019"/&gt;]]
Possibly related to the [[Time perception#Oddball effect|oddball effect]], research suggests that [[time dilation|time seems to slow down]] for a person during intense events—such as a car accident, a robbery, a chase, [[skydiving]] or [[bungee jumping]], a potential predator threat or an intimacy with [[sexual partner]] (which would elicit [[sexual excitement]], which in turn release [[adrenaline]]),&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, L. A., and Bryant, R. A. (2007). How time flies: a study of novice skydivers. Behav. Res. Ther. 45, 1389–1392.&lt;/ref&gt; where they're capable of complex thoughts in what would normally be the blink of an eye caused by [[Fight-or-flight response]]. This reported slowing in temporal perception may have been evolutionary advantageous because it may have enhanced one's ability to intelligibly make quick [[Decision-making|decisions]] in moments that were of critical importance to our survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geoghagen|first1=Tom|title=Turn back the clock|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6926500.stm|publisher=BBC News Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though observers commonly report that time seems to have moved in slow motion during these events, it is unclear whether this is a function of increased time resolution during the event, or instead an illusion created by the remembering of an emotionally salient event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-19477623 Why top sport stars might have 'more time' on the ball] by Jonathan Amos Science correspondent, [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An Israeli research team have observed a strong time dilation effect in objects that were looming, but not the retreating, from the subjects. They theorize that the expanding discs—which mimic an approaching object—elicit [[self-referential]] processes which act to signal the presence of a possible danger. [[Anxious]] people, or those in great [[fear]], experience greater "time dilation" in response to the same threat stimuli brought on by the increased brain activity caused by [[epinephrine]], or an adrenaline rush.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Haim, Y., Kerem, A., Lamy, D., and Zakay, D.

Some research suggests that the effect appears only at the point of retrospective assessment, rather than occurring simultaneously with events as they happened.&lt;ref name="pmid18074019"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stetson C, Fiesta MP, Eagleman DM | title = Does time really slow down during a frightening event? | journal = PLoS One | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = e1295 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18074019 | pmc = 2110887 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0001295 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptual abilities were tested during a frightening experience - a [[free fall]] - by measuring people's sensitivity to flickering stimuli. The results showed that the subjects' temporal resolution was not improved as the frightening event was occurring. Events appear to have taken longer only in retrospect, possibly because memories were being more densely packed during the frightening situation.

However, newer research from 2012 suggests that effective motor preparation (the paper giving the example of professional athletes) can indeed lead to slowed time perception, involving not memory but enhanced sensory processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hagura, Kanai, Orgs, Haggard |first1=Nobuhiro, Ryota, Guido, Patrick |title=Ready steady slow: action preparation slows the subjective passage of time |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/09/04/rspb.2012.1339 |website=rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org |publisher=The Royal Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a review of most current research on the topic by the University of Turku also supports the above results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Arstila |first1=Valtteri |title=Time Slows Down during Accidents |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3384265/ |website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |publisher=University of Turku}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

People shown extracts from films known to induce [[fear]] often overestimated the elapsed time of a subsequently presented visual stimulus, whereas people shown clips known to evoke feelings of sadness or emotionally-neutral clips from weather forecasts and stock market updates showed no difference. It is argued that fear prompts a state of arousal in the [[amygdala]], which increases the rate of a hypothesised "internal clock." This could be the result of an evolved defensive mechanism triggered by a threatening situation.&lt;ref name="pmid21886610"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Droit-Volet S, Fayolle SL, Gil S | title = Emotion and time perception: effects of film-induced mood | journal = Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 33 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21886610 | pmc = 3152725 | doi = 10.3389/fnint.2011.00033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other emotional states===
Research has suggested the feeling of [[awe]] has the ability to expand one's perceptions of time availability. Awe can be characterized as an experience of immense perceptual vastness that coincides with an increase in focus. Consequently, it is conceivable that one's temporal perception would slow down when experiencing awe.&lt;ref name="pmid22886132"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rudd M, Vohs KD, Aaker J | title = Awe expands people's perception of time, alters decision making, and enhances well-being | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 1130–6 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22886132 | doi = 10.1177/0956797612438731 | url = http://www.carlsonschool.umn.edu/assets/lib/assets/AssetLibrary/2012/Rudd_Vohs_Aaker_2012_psych%20science.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of another persons' emotions can also change our sense of time. The theory of embodied mind (or cognition), as caused by [[mirror neuron]]s, helps explain how the perception of other people's emotions has the ability to change one's own sense of time. Embodied cognition hinges on an internal process that mimics or simulates another's emotional state. For example, if person #1 spends time with person #2 who speaks and walks incredibly slowly, person #1's internal clock may slow down.

Depression may increase one's ability to perceive time accurately. One study assessed this concept by asking subjects to estimate the amount of time that passed during intervals ranging from 3 seconds to 65 seconds.&lt;ref name=DepressiveRealism&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kornbrot DE, Msetfi RM, Grimwood MJ | title = Time perception and depressive realism: judgment type, psychophysical functions and bias | journal = PLoS One | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = e71585 | date = 21 August 2013 | pmid = 23990960 | pmc = 3749223 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0071585 | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0071585 | lay-url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130822090326.htm | lay-date = 22 August 2013 | lay-source = Science Daily | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140214092825/http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071585 | archivedate = 14 February 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results indicated that depressed subjects more accurately estimated the amount of time that had passed than non-depressed patients; non-depressed subjects overestimated the passing of time. This difference was hypothesized to be because depressed subjects focused less on external factors that may skew their judgement of time. The authors termed this hypothesized phenomenon "depressive realism."&lt;ref name=DepressiveRealism/&gt;

===Sleep===
[[File:Dreams - Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|240px|A person can experience a long [[dream]] which may have seemed to go on for hours, yet, in reality, it actually lasted only a few seconds or maybe minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Holcombe, A. O. (2009). Seeing slow and seeing fast: two limits on perception. Trends Cogn. Sci. (Regul. Ed.) 13, 216–221.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The perception of time is temporarily suspended during [[sleep]], or more often during [[REM sleep]]. This can be attributed to the [[altered state of consciousness]] associated with sleep where the person is kept [[Spatial disorientation|unaware of their surroundings]], which would make it difficult to remain informed of the passing of time. When the person awakes in the morning, they have the memory of going to bed the night before, but new memories are rarely made during sleep.

Therefore, upon waking up the following morning it feels as if no time has passed, but the human mind reasons that many hours have elapsed simply because it is now light outside. The passing of time is a [[theory of relativity|relative]] event brought about by observation of objects (the sun’s location, the moon, a clock's time). Without a reference point there would be no context other than day or night. So, as far as time passing faster when during sleep may be due to the lack of reference points that convince the sleeper the time has passed quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencefocus.com/article/human-body-mind/why-does-time-go-so-fast-when-you%E2%80%99re-asleep|title=Why does time go so fast when you’re asleep?|date=7 February 2016|work=BBC Science Focus|accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs===
[[Stimulants]] produce overestimates of time duration, whereas [[depressants]] and anesthetics produce underestimates of time duration.&lt;ref name="Rammsayer_1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rammsayer T | title = Is there a common dopaminergic basis of time perception and reaction time? | journal = Neuropsychobiology | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–42 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2573003 | doi = 10.1159/000118549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoactive drugs can alter the judgement of time. These include traditional psychedelics such as [[LSD]], [[psilocybin]], and [[mescaline]] as well as the dissociative class of psychedelics such as [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[ketamine]] and [[dextromethorphan]]. At higher doses time may appear to slow down, speed up or seem out of sequence. In 1955, British MP [[Christopher Mayhew]] took [[Mescaline|mescaline hydrochloride]] in an experiment under the guidance of his friend, Dr [[Humphry Osmond]]. On the BBC documentary ''The Beyond Within'', he described that half a dozen times during the experiment, he had "a period of time that didn't end for [him]".

Dopamine has a particularly strong connection with one's perception of time. Drugs that activate dopamine receptors speed up one's perception of time, while dopamine antagonists cause one to feel that time is passing slowly.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wittmann, Leland, Churan, Paulus |first1=Marc, David, Jan, Martin |title=Impaired time perception and motor timing in stimulant-dependent subjects |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1997301/ |website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |publisher=NCBI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cannabis and time perception|effect of cannabis on time perception]] has been studied with inconclusive results.

The phrase has been deployed in the wake of numerous [[mass shooting]]s, including the [[Columbine High School massacre]] (1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0424a.htm |title=Official: Bombs planted during prom party? |author1=Robinson, Marilyn |author2=Obmascik, Mark |author3=Lowe, Peggy |date=24 April 1999 |newspaper=The Denver Post |accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|114|sres|313|site=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Orlando nightclub shooting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://time.com/4365289/orlando-shooting-pulse-politicans-react/ |title=U.S. Political Leaders React to Pulse Nightclub Shooting in Orlando |author=Chan, Melissa |date=12 June 2016 |magazine=Time |accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/10/after-vegas-shooting-trump-sticks-to-thoughts-and-prayers.html |title=Trump Sticks to Thoughts and Prayers in Speech on Las Vegas Shooting |author=Levitz, Eric |date=2 October 2017 |magazine=New York |accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, "thoughts and prayers" are also offered to victims of natural disasters, such as [[Hurricane Katrina]] (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://corporate.walmart.com/_news_/executive-viewpoints/a-message-to-individuals-impacted-by-hurricane-katrina |title=A Message to Individuals Impacted by Hurricane Katrina |date=2 September 2005 |publisher=Walmart |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/main/news-and-media/statements/statement-hurricane-katrina-relief.html |title=Statement: Hurricane Katrina Relief |author=Clinton, Bill |date=2 September 2005 |publisher=Clinton Foundation |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[2017 Central Mexico earthquake]], and [[Hurricane Maria]] (2017).&lt;ref name=DN-170921 /&gt;

==Views==
After a natural or human-caused disaster, people may be urged to "go beyond thoughts and prayers," by donating blood or sending aid or money to help the victims. After the Las Vegas shooting, authorities said that although thoughts and prayers are appreciated, the most effective way to help was to give blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://qz.com/1092031/las-vegas-shooting-people-are-lining-up-at-blood-banks-to-help-the-victims/|title=Beyond thoughts and prayers: People line up at blood banks to help the victims of the Las Vegas shooting|last=Rigby|first=Sam|date=2 October 2017|work=Quartz|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
As "thoughts and prayers" became associated with post-tragedy condolences, commentators have criticized the phrase as a form of civilian or political [[slacktivism]].&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |last=Willingham |first=AJ |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/20/us/thoughts-and-prayers-florida-school-shooting-trnd/index.html |title=How 'thoughts and prayers' went from common condolence to cynical meme |publisher=CNN |date=20 February 2018 |accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2007 [[Virginia Tech shooting]], [[Katrina vanden Heuvel]], editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', called on politicians to "move beyond thoughts and prayers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut?pid=186561 |title=Beyond Thoughts and Prayers |author=vanden Heuvel, Katrina |date=16 April 2007 |work=The Nation |accessdate=3 October 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428201334/http://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut?pid=186561 |archivedate=28 April 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her post, vanden Heuvel referred to a press release by [[Paul Helmke]], then-president of the [[Brady Campaign]], who offered his thoughts and prayers but also stated "it is long overdue for us to take some common-sense actions to prevent tragedies like this from continuing to occur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://bradycampaign.org:80/media/release.php?release=884 |title=Nation Again Grieves Over A Tragedy "Of Monumental Proportions |author=Helmke, Paul |date=16 April 2007 |publisher=Brady Campaign |accessdate=3 October 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502133307/http://bradycampaign.org/media/release.php?release=884 |archivedate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, following the [[Umpqua Community College shooting]], President [[Barack Obama]] said that "thoughts and prayers [do] not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel, and it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted some place else in America next week or a couple months from now."{{efn|name=Obamastatement}} The [[White House]] subsequently announced that Obama would continue to take more executive action on the subject of [[gun control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/05/daily-press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-1052015|title=Daily Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest, 10/5/2015|work=The White House|date=October 5, 2015|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2015, in the wake of the [[2015 San Bernardino attack|San Bernardino mass shooting]], Senator [[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]] (D-CT) tweeted his frustration with the phrase "thoughts and prayers", a sentiment echoed by the cover of the ''New York Daily News'', which included tweets from senators and representatives the newspaper characterized as "meaningless platitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/02/politics/san-bernardino-chris-murphy-connecticut-tweet/index.html |title=Connecticut senator has had enough of 'thoughts' and 'prayers' |author=Diamond, Jeremy |date=3 December 2015 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Orlando nightclub shooting]], [[Phil Plait]] wrote that while it was "natural and very human" to "send their thoughts and express their grief ... it's cynically hypocritical when politicians do it ''and nothing else''", later noting it was "particularly galling" to see "all the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]]-funded lawmakers tweeting their 'thoughts and prayers'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2016/06/13/orlando_shooting_we_need_to_do_more_than_send_thoughts_and_prayers.html |title=Orlando: What can you do in the Face of Another Senseless Gun Tragedy |author=Plait, Phil |date=13 June 2016 |work=Slate |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An accompanying ''Slate'' post provided a selected list of members of Congress who had tweeted "thoughts and prayers" along with the amount of campaign contributions they had received from gun rights groups, based on research provided by Igor Volsky of the [[Center for American Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/06/12/gop_congressmen_offering_thoughts_and_prayers_for_orlando_accepted_nra_donations.html |title=GOP Congressmen Offer "Thoughts and Prayers."

Some critics of the phrase "thoughts and prayers" point to the [[Epistle of James]] in the Christian [[New Testament]] to argue that action is needed in addition to expressions of faith. Verses commonly cited to back up this argument include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/10/03/why-thoughts-and-prayers-is-starting-to-sound-so-profane/ |title=Acts of Faith: Why ‘thoughts and prayers’ is starting to sound so profane |author=Powers, Kirsten |date=3 October 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2017/10/las_vegas_mass_shooting.html |title=Opinion: Your thoughts and prayers haven't stopped mass shootings |author=DeBerry, Jarvis |date=2 October 2017 |newspaper=The Times-Picayune |location=New Orleans, Louisiana |accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text=What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?

===Defense===
Laura Coward, a writer for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', defended the use of the phrase "thoughts and prayers", acknowledging the inadequacy of not taking actions, but arguing that prayer "jolts us and disrupts us, removing us from our comfort zones [... it] takes us to uncomfortable places – spiritually, physically and emotionally – and asks us to do the hard work of accepting more than one perspective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-defense-of-offering-our-thoughts-and-prayers_us_57817fb5e4b0f06648f505d9 |title=In Defense of Offering Our 'Thoughts and Prayers' |author=Coward, Laura |date=9 July 2016 |website=Huffpost |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimberly Ross, a writer for ''[[RedState]]'', asks that victims should "not [be] used as pawns in another political debate about guns" since "[w]e shouldn't blame anyone but the perpetrator for crimes committed, [...] that means we can do nothing on our own – in that moment – apart from submitting thoughts and prayers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.redstate.com/kimberly_ross/2016/06/13/thoughts-prayers-always-needed-terror-strikes/ |title="Thoughts And Prayers" Are Always Needed After Terror Strikes |author=Ross, Kimberly |date=13 June 2016 |newspaper=RedState |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
In his third stand up special "Thoughts and Prayers", comedian [[Anthony Jeselnik]] skewers people who tweet out "thoughts and prayers" on the day of a tragedy, calling it a way for those people to garner attention in the face of a tragedy and saying that tweeting thoughts and prayers is so useless that it achieves "less than nothing".&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

In 2016, a web-based video game, ''Thoughts and Prayers: The Game'', was published to argue that thoughts and prayers have had no effect on saving lives in the context of mass shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/06/computer-game-shows-just-how-effective-your-thoughts-and-prayers-are.html |title=This Is Not Your Average Shooting Game |author=Kircher, Madison Malone |date=17 June 2016 |work=New York |accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth episode of the fourth season of animated series ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'', titled "Thoughts and Prayers", presents a real-life shooting that delays the opening of a new movie featuring gun violence.&lt;ref name=Browbeat-171002 /&gt;

In June 2017, the air date for an episode of ''[[The Carmichael Show]]'' entitled "Shoot-up-able", which showed the main character surviving a mass shooting, was postponed by two weeks so that it did not air 14 June, the same night as the shooting at which Representative Scalise and three others were shot, or the [[San Francisco UPS shooting|UPS shooting in San Francisco]], where three were killed by a shooter who later committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/06/15/nbc_postponed_a_carmichael_show_episode_about_mass_shootings.html |title=NBC Decides It's Too Soon for a ''Carmichael Show'' Episode About Mass Shootings |author=Adams, Sam |date=15 June 2017 |work=Slate |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbc-reschedules-carmichael-show-mass-shooting-episode-1016464 |title=NBC Reschedules 'Carmichael Show' Mass Shooting Episode |author=Stanhope, Kate |date=26 June 2017 |newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early August 2018, after court documents were made public showing the [[National Rifle Association#Finances|NRA was having financial issues]], mocking tweets were made offering thoughts and prayers for the NRA's troubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pitofsky |first1=Marina |title=Twitter users troll NRA for financial woes, calling for 'thoughts and prayers.' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/08/04/nra-thoughts-and-prayers-twitter/905413002/ |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=USA Today |date=4 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2451">'''Trading Blows'', or'' Trading licks'', or '''- blows, - shots'', etc., is an endurance test in which the participants (usually two [[boy]]s or young men) take turns, alternating between administering a blow to an opponent and assuming the agreed exposed position (e.g. bending over an object or grabbing the ankles) to endure the next one, using the same implement (e.g. a [[fraternity paddle]]), until only the winner can still bring himself to endure the gradually increasing pain in the progressively tormented target part of their anatomy (usually the posterior, in which case it is a form of [[spanking]], or the cheeks), which in the interest of fairness should be either bared or only covered by a common uniform. As the blows are not given by the same person but by the parties themselves, the strongest-armed one actually has an unfair (but not always decisive) physical advantage.

Such rather [[macho]] displays of willpower, restraining the instinct to avoid pain, can serve various purposes, including:
*a [[physical punishment]], especially for quarreling, possibly the origin of the practice (this ritualized alternative to a more disabling or even lethal [[duel]] should also make its participants realize the futility of physical aggression)
*a motivation test, especially as part of an initiation process, such as [[hazing]]
*an obedience test, as in certain [[Paddle (spanking)|paddle game]]s (possibly really an excuse for the rather sadistic amusement of the seniors)
*a duel, either personal or as champions representing similar, especially rivaling, groups; in certain fraternities, refusing such a challenge may result in exclusion from the membership, even for an alumnus
*as a game, either to 'proudly' display one's tenacity (often to impress some audience) or in the pursuit of a sadist and/or masochistic, erotic or pain-addicted, kick.
*as a [[sexual fetish]]

Another game with the same name is often played among boys or young men, where two people agree on a place to hit the other (e.g. the shoulder or chest) and the two take turns trading punches until one person cannot stand the pain any longer. The first person to give up is the loser.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16822">'''True self''' (also known as '''real self''', '''authentic self''', '''original self''' and '''vulnerable self''') and '''false self''' (also known as '''fake self''', '''idealized self''', '''superficial self''' and '''pseudo self''') are psychological concepts often used in connection with [[narcissism]]. 

The concepts were introduced into [[psychoanalysis]] in 1960 by [[Donald Winnicott]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ego distortion in terms of true and false self|last = Winnicott|first = D. W.|date = 1965|journal = The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment: Studies in the Theory of Emotional Development|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 140–57|publisher = International Universities Press, Inc|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winnicott used true self to describe a sense of self based on spontaneous authentic experience, and a feeling of being alive, having a real self.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Good Feelings'' (London 2009) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The false self, by contrast, Winnicott saw as a defensive façade&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – one which in extreme cases could leave its holders lacking spontaneity and feeling dead and empty, behind a mere appearance of being real.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To maintain their [[self-esteem]], and protect their vulnerable true selves, narcissists need to [[Abusive power and control|control]] others' behavior – particularly that of [[Narcissistic parent|their children]], seen as extensions of themselves.&lt;ref name=co&gt;Rappoport, Alan, Ph. D.[http://www.alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf Co-Narcissism: How We Adapt to Narcissism. The Therapist, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Winnicott saw the true self as rooted from early infancy in the experience of being alive, including blood pumping and lungs breathing – what Winnicott called simply being.&lt;ref name="Mary Jacobus 2005 p. 160"&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis'' (Oxford 2005) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Out of this, the baby creates the experience of a sense of [[reality]], a sense that life is worth living.  The baby's spontaneous, nonverbal gestures derive from that [[instinct]]ual sense,&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, "Ego Distortion in Terms of True and false self ', in ''The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment'' (London 1965) p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; and if responded to by the mother, become the basis for the continuing development of the true self.

However, when what Winnicott was careful to describe as good enough parenting – i.e., not necessarily perfect!&lt;ref&gt;Simon Grolnick, ''The Work &amp; Play of Winnicott''  (New Jersey: Aronson 1990) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; – was ''not'' in place, the infant's spontaneity was in danger of being encroached on by the need for compliance with the parents' wishes/expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (London 1996) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The result for Winnicott could be the creation of what he called the false self, where "Other people's expectations can become of overriding importance, overlaying or contradicting the original sense of self, the one connected to the very roots of one's being".&lt;ref&gt;Winnicott, quoted in Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;  The danger he saw was that "through this false self, the infant builds up a false set of relationships, and by means of introjections even attains a show of being real",&lt;ref&gt;Winnicott, quoted in Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; while, in fact, merely concealing a barren emptiness behind an independent-seeming façade.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (London 1996) pp. 119–20&lt;/ref&gt;

The danger was particularly acute where the baby had to provide attunement for the mother/parents, rather than vice versa, building up a sort of dissociated recognition of the object on an impersonal, not personal and spontaneous basis.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (London 1994) pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; But while such a pathological false self stifled the spontaneous gestures of the true self in favour of a lifeless imitation, Winnicott nevertheless considered it of vital importance in preventing something worse: the annihilating experience of the exploitation of the hidden true self itself.&lt;ref name="Mary Jacobus 2005 p. 160"/&gt;

==Precursors==
There was much in psychoanalytic theory on which Winnicott could draw for his concept of the false self. [[Helene Deutsch]] had described the "as if" personalities, with their pseudo relationships substituting for real ones.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; Winnicott's analyst, [[Joan Riviere]], had explored the concept of the narcissist's masquerade – superficial assent concealing a subtle hidden struggle for control.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis: In the Wake of Klein'' (Oxford 2005) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freud]]'s own late theory of the ego as the product of identifications&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; came close to viewing it only as a false self;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''Winnicott'' (Harvard 1988) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; while Winnicott's true/false distinction has also been compared to [[Michael Balint]]'s "basic fault" and to [[Ronald Fairbairn]]'s notion of the "compromised ego".&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Padel, "Freudianism: Later Developments", in Richard Gregory ed., ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]], in his book ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' distinguished between original self and pseudo self – the inauthenticality of the latter being a way to escape the loneliness of freedom;&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm (1942), ''The Fear of Freedom'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul 2001) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; while much earlier the existentialist like [[Kierkegaard]] had claimed that  "to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair" – the despair of choosing "to be another than himself".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Carl Rogers]], ''On Becoming a Person'' (1961) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karen Horney]], in her 1950 book, ''[[Neurosis and Human Growth]]'', based her idea of "true self" and "false self" through the view of self-improvement, interpreting it as real self and ideal self, with the real self being what one currently is and the ideal self being what one could become.&lt;ref name="horneyk"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Neurosis and Human Growth]] | author=Horney, Karen | year=1950 | isbn=0-393-00135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Karen Horney#Theory of the self|Karen Horney §&amp;nbsp;Theory of the self]]).

==Later developments==
The last half-century have seen Winnicott's ideas extended and applied in a variety of contexts, both in psychoanalysis and beyond.

===Kohut&lt;!--linked from 'Self psychology'--&gt;===
{{Main|Heinz Kohut}}
Kohut extended Winnicott's work in his investigation of narcissism,&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. DeRobertis, ''Humanizing Child Development Theories'' (2008), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; seeing narcissists as evolving a defensive armor around their damaged inner selves.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; He considered it less pathological to identify with the damaged remnants of the self, than to achieve coherence through identification with an external personality at the cost of one's own autonomous creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Kohut, ''How Does Analysis Cure?'' (London 1984), pp. 142, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lowen===
{{Main|Alexander Lowen}}
Alexander Lowen identified narcissists as having a true and a false, or superficial, self. The false self rests on the surface, as the self presented to the world. It stands in contrast to the true self, which resides behind the facade or image. This true self is the feeling self, but it is a self that must be hidden and denied. Since the superficial self represents submission and conformity, the inner or true self is rebellious and angry. This underlying rebellion and anger can never be fully suppressed since it is an expression of the life force in that person. But because of the [[denial]], it cannot be expressed directly. Instead it shows up in the narcissist's [[acting out]]. And it can become a perverse force.&lt;ref&gt;Lowen, Alexander. ''Narcissism: Denial of the true self''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 2004, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masterson===
{{Main|James F. Masterson}}
James F. Masterson argued that all the [[personality disorders]] crucially involve the conflict between a person's two selves: the false self, which the very young child constructs to please the mother, and the true self. The psychotherapy of personality disorders is an attempt to put people back in touch with their real selves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2010/04/20/dr_james_masterson_expert_on_personality_disorders_at_84/ Dr. James Masterson, expert on personality disorders; at 84]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symington===
{{Main|Neville Symington}}
Symington developed Winnicott's contrast between true and false self to cover the ''sources'' of personal action, contrasting an autonomous and a discordant source of action – the latter drawn from the internalisation of external influences and pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) pp. 36, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example parental dreams of self-glorification by way of their child's achievements can be internalised as an alien discordant source of action.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisandrath, ''Women and Desire'' (London 2000) pp. 112, 198&lt;/ref&gt; Symington stressed however the ''intentional'' element in the individual's abandoning the autonomous self in favour of a false self or narcissistic mask – something he considered Winnicott to have overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaknin===
As part of what has been described as a personal mission by self-confessed narcissist and author [[Sam Vaknin]] to raise the profile of the condition.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Crompton, ''All about Me: Loving a Narcissist'' (London 2007) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Vaknin has highlighted the role of the false self in narcissism. The false self replaces the narcissist's true self and is intended to shield him from hurt and [[narcissistic injury]] by self-imputing omnipotence. The narcissist pretends that his false self is real and demands that others affirm this confabulation, meanwhile keeping his real imperfect true self under wraps.&lt;ref&gt;Vaknin S [http://samvak.tripod.com/faq48.html The Dual Role of the Narcissist's False Self]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Vaknin, the false self is by far more important to the narcissist than his dilapidated, dysfunctional true self; and in contrast to the psychoanalysts he does not believe in the ability to resuscitate it through therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Vaknin/Lidija Rangelovska ''Malignant Self-Love'' (2003) pp. 187–88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miller===
{{Main|Alice Miller (psychologist)}}
Alice Miller cautiously warns that a child/patient may not have ''any'' formed true self, waiting behind the false self facade;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of the Gifted Child'' (2004) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and that as a result freeing the true self is not as simple as the Winnicottian image of the butterfly emerging from its cocoon.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  If a true self can be developed, however, she considered that the empty [[grandiosity]] of the false self could give way to a new sense of autonomous vitality.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of Being a Child'' (2004) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbach: false bodies===
{{Main|Susie Orbach}}

Susie Orbach saw the false self as an overdevelopment (under parental pressure) of certain aspects of the self at the expense of other aspects – of the full potential of the self – producing thereby an abiding distrust of what emerges spontaneously from the individual himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, ''Bodies'' (London 2009) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Orbach went on to extend Winnicott's account of how environmental failure can lead to an inner splitting of mind and body,&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''Winnicott on the Child'' (2002) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; so as to cover the idea of the false body –  falsified sense of one's own body.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, ''The Impossibility of Sex'' (Penguin 1999) pp. 48, 216&lt;/ref&gt; Orbach saw the female false body in particular as built upon identifications with others, at the cost of an inner sense of authenticity and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, in Lawrence Spurling ed., ''Winnicott Studies'' (1995) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking up a monolithic but false body-sense in the process of therapy could allow for the emergence of a range of authentic (even if often painful) body feelings in the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, ''Bodies'' (London 2009) pp. 67–72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jungian persona===
{{Main|Carl Jung}}
Jungians have explored the overlap between Jung's concept of the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] and Winnicott's false self;&lt;ref&gt;Mario Jacoby, ''Shame and the Origins of Self-Esteem'' (1996) pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; but, while noting similarities, consider that only the most rigidly defensive persona approximates to the pathological status of the false self.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath/James Albert Hall, ''Jung's Self Psychology'' (1991) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stern's tripartite self&lt;!--linked from 'Daniel Stern (psychologist)'--&gt;===
{{Main|Daniel Stern (psychologist)}}

Daniel Stern considered Winnicott's sense of "going on being" as constitutive of the core, pre-verbal self.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Stern, ''[[The Interpersonal World of the Infant]]'' (1985) pp. 7, 93&lt;/ref&gt; He also explored how language could be used to reinforce a false sense of self, leaving the true self linguistically opaque and disavowed.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Stern, ''[[The Interpersonal World of the Infant]]'' (1985) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; He ended however by proposing a three-fold division of social, private, and of disavowed self.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jacobs, ''D. W. Winnicott'' (1995) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[Neville Symington]] criticised Winnicott for failing to integrate his false self insight with the theory of [[Id, ego, and super-ego|ego and id]].&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, continental analysts like [[Jean-Bertrand Pontalis]] have made use of true/false self as a ''clinical'' distinction, while having reservations about its theoretical status.&lt;ref&gt;V. R. Sherwood/C. P. Cohen, ''Psychotherapy of the Quiet Borderline Patient'' (1994) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] took issue more broadly with the concept of a true self on the [[anti-essentialism|anti-essentialist]] grounds that the self was a construct – something one had to evolve through a process of subjectification, an ''aesthetics'' of self-formation, not something simply waiting to be uncovered:&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rabinov ed., ''The Foucault Reader'' (1991) p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; "we have to create ourselves as a work of art".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jon Simons ed. ''Contemporary Critical Theorists'' (2006) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==

A '''two-dimensional graph''' is a set of points in [[two-dimensional space]]. If the points are [[Function of a real variable|real]] and if [[Cartesian coordinates]] are used, each [[axis (mathematics)|axis]] depicts the potential values of a particular [[real number|real variable]]. Often the  variable on the horizontal axis is called ''x'' and the one on the vertical axis is called ''y'', in which case the horizontal and vertical axes are sometimes called the ''x'' axis and ''y'' axis respectively.   With real variables on the axes, each point in the [[graph of a function|graph]] depicts the values of two real variables.

Alternatively, each point in a graph may depict the value of a single [[complex variable]]. This two-dimensional graph is called [[Complex plane#Argand diagram|Argand diagram]]. In the Argand diagram, the horizontal axis is called the real axis and depicts the potential values of the real part of the [[complex number]], while the vertical axis is called the [[imaginary number|imaginary]] axis and depicts the potential values of the imaginary part of the complex number.

[[Image:cubicpoly.svg|right|thumb|400 px| Graph of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)={{x^3}-9x} \!\ &lt;/math&gt;]]

==Graph of a function==

{{Main|Graph of a function}}

If the relation between the two real variables is of the form &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; where ''f'' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] giving a single value of ''y'' associated with each admissible value of ''x'', then the graph is called the graph of a function. The function could be a [[polynomial]] function or a [[transcendental function]]. 

For example, the graph of the [[cubic polynomial]] 
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)={{x^3}-9x} \!\ &lt;/math&gt;
is
: {(''x'', ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;−9''x'') : ''x'' is a real number}.
If this set is plotted on a [[Cartesian plane]], the result is a curve (see figure).

==Graph of a non-function relation==
[[Image:Circle center a b radius r.svg|thumb|right|Circle of radius ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, centre (''a'', ''b'') =&amp;nbsp;(1.2,&amp;nbsp;−0.5)]]
{{see also|Binary relation|Plane curve}}

In some cases the relation between two real variables cannot be written in the form &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, it is not a function. Nevertheless, the set of all points given by the relation is still a two-dimensional graph, as in the accompanying graph of the circle &lt;math&gt;(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=1.&lt;/math&gt;

An [[image (mathematics)|image]] of a [[plane curve]] is also a two-dimensional graph, although only some two-dimensional graphs are an image of any plane curve.

==Superimposed graphs of more than one function==
[[File:Supply-and-demand.svg|thumb|left|240px|The price P of a product is determined by a balance between production at each price (supply S) and the desires of those with [[purchasing power]] at each price (demand D). The diagram shows a positive shift in demand from D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in an increase in price (P) and quantity sold (Q) of the product.]]

In some contexts it is useful to graph two or more functions together in the same diagram. An example is the [[supply and demand]] graph commonly used in [[Economic graph|economics]], shown here.

== Graph of geometric shapes ==
[[File:Area.svg|thumb|250px|Geometric shapes in 2 dimensions]]

Two-dimensional [[geometric shape]]s are sets of points bounded by [[line segment]]s or [[curve]]s, so a shape can also be constructed by graphs of several equations of its boundary. [[Polygon]]s are the shapes that are only bounded by line segments. These can be visualized by using two-dimensional graphs. Graphs of two polygons, a [[parallelogram]] and a [[right triangle]], are shown here along with the graph of a circle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11167">{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}
The '''uniform access principle''' of [[computer programming]] was put forth by [[Bertrand Meyer]] (originally in ''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]''). It states "All services offered by a [[modular programming|module]] should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through computation".&lt;ref name=c2&gt;{{cite web|title=The UniformAccessPrinciple|url=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UniformAccessPrinciple|work=c2 wiki|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle applies generally to the [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] of [[object-oriented]] [[programming languages]]. In simpler form, it states that there should be no syntactical difference between working with an [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]], pre-computed [[Property (programming)|property]], or [[Method (computer science)|method]]/[[Information retrieval|query]] of an object.

While most examples focus on the "read" aspect of the principle (i.e., retrieving a value), Meyer shows that the "write" implications (i.e., modifying a value) of the principle are harder to deal with in his monthly column on the [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel programming language]] official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyer|first=Bertrand|title=EiffelWorld Column: Business plus pleasure|url=http://www.eiffel.com/general/monthly_column/2005/Sept_October.html|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
The problem being addressed by Meyer involves the maintenance of large software projects or software libraries. Sometimes when developing or maintaining software it is necessary, after much code is in place, to change a class or object in a way that transforms what was simply an attribute access into a method call.  Programming languages often use different syntax for attribute access and invoking a method, (e.g., {{code|object.something}} versus {{code|object.something()}}). The syntax change would require, in popular programming languages of the day, changing the source code in all the places where the attribute was used.  This might require changing source code in many different locations throughout a very large volume of source code. Or worse, if the change is in an object library used by hundreds of customers, each of those customers would have to find and change all the places the attribute was used in their own code and recompile their programs.

Going the reverse way (from method to simple attribute) really was not a problem, as one can always just keep the function and have it simply return the attribute value.

Meyer recognized the need for software developers to write code in such a way as to minimize or eliminate cascading changes in code that result from changes which convert an object attribute to a method call or vice versa. For this he developed the Uniform Access Principle.

Many programming languages do not strictly support the UAP but do support forms of it.  Properties, which are provided in a number of programming languages, address the problem Meyer was addressing with his UAP in a different way. Instead of providing a single uniform notation, properties provide a way to invoke a method of an object while using the same notation as is used for attribute access.  The separate method invocation syntax is still available.

== UAP Example ==
If the language uses the method invocation syntax it may look something like this.
&lt;pre&gt;
//Assume print displays the variable passed to it, with or without parens
//Set Foo's attribute 'bar' to  value 5.
Foo.bar(5)
print Foo.bar()
&lt;/pre&gt;
When executed, should display :
&lt;pre&gt;
5
&lt;/pre&gt;
Whether or not Foo.bar(5) invokes a function or simply sets an attribute is hidden from the caller.
Likewise whether Foo.bar() simply retrieves the value of the attribute, or invokes a function
to compute the value returned, is an implementation detail hidden from the caller.

If the language uses the attribute syntax the syntax may look like this.
&lt;pre&gt;
Foo.bar = 5
print Foo.bar
&lt;/pre&gt;
Again, whether or not a method is invoked, or the value is simply assigned to an attribute is hidden
from the calling method.

== Problems ==

However, UAP itself can lead to problems, if used in places where the differences between access methods are ''not'' negligible, such as when the returned value is expensive to compute or will trigger cache operations.&lt;ref name=c2/&gt; It might not matter in principle to the client how the value of 42 was obtained, but if computing it [[Deep Thought (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|requires running a planet-sized computer for 7.5 million years]], the client ought to know what to expect.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== Language Examples ==
=== Ruby ===

Consider the following
&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
y = Egg.new( "Green")
y.color = "White" 
puts y.color
&lt;/source&gt;
Now the Egg class could be defined as follows
&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
class Egg
  attr_accessor :color
  def initialize( color )
    @color = color
  end
end
&lt;/source&gt;
The above initial code segment would work fine with the Egg being defined as such. The Egg
class could also be defined as below, where color is instead a method. The calling code would
still work, unchanged if Egg were to be defined as follows.
&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
class Egg
  
  def initialize(color)
    @rgb_color = to_rgb(color)
  end

  def color
     to_color_name(@rgb_color)
  end
 
  def color=(color) 
     @rgb_color = to_rgb(color)
  end

  private
  def to_rgb(color_name)
     .....
  end

  def to_color_name(color)
     ....
  end
end
&lt;/source&gt;

Note how even though &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; looks like an attribute in one case and a pair of methods
in the next, the interface to the class remains the same.  The person maintaining the Egg class can switch from one form to the other without fear of breaking any caller's code.
Ruby follows the revised UAP, the &lt;code&gt;attr_accessor :color&lt;/code&gt; only acts as [[syntactic sugar]] for generating accessor/setter methods for &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;. There is no way in Ruby to retrieve an instance variable from an object without calling a method on it.

Strictly speaking, Ruby does not follow Meyer's original UAP in that the syntax for accessing an attribute is different from the syntax for invoking a method.  But here, the access for an attribute will always actually be through a function which is often automatically generated. So in essence, either type of access invokes a function and the language does follow Meyer's revised Uniform Access Principle.

=== Python ===

[[Python (programming language)#Objects|Python properties]] may be used to allow a method
to be invoked with the same syntax as accessing an attribute.  Whereas Meyer's UAP would have
a single notation for both attribute access and method invocation (method invocation syntax), 
a language with support for properties still supports separate notations for attribute
and method access.  Properties allow the attribute notation to be used, but to hide the
fact that a method is being invoked instead of simply retrieving or setting a value. 

In the strict sense, Python does NOT follow the UAP because there is a syntax difference
between normal method invocations and attribute access.

In Python, we may have code that access an object as follows 
&lt;source lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; egg = Egg( 4, "White")
&gt;&gt;&gt; egg.color = "Green"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print egg.weight, egg.color, egg.quack()
4 Green quack
&lt;/source&gt;
A Egg object could be defined such that weight and color are simple attributes as in the following
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
class Egg(object):
    def __init__(self, weight, color):
        self.weight = weight
        self.color = color
    def quack(self):
        return "quack"
&lt;/source&gt;
Or the Egg object could use properties, and invoke methods instead
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
class Egg(object):
    def __init__(self, weight, color):
        self.__weight = toGrams(weight)
        self.__color = toRGB(color)

    def setColor(self, colorname):
        self.__color = toRGB(colorname)

    def getColor(self):
        return toColorName(self.__color)
    
    color = property(getColor, setColor, doc="Color of the Egg")

    def setWeight(self, weightOz);
        self.__weight = 29.3*weightOz

    def getWeight(self):
        return self.__weight/29.3;

    weight = property(setWeight, getWeight, doc="Weight in Ounces")

    def quack(self):
        return "quack"
&lt;/source&gt;
Regardless of which way Egg is defined, the calling code can remain the same.  The implementation of Egg can switch from one form to the other without affecting code that uses the Egg class. Languages which implement the UAP have this property as well.

=== C# ===

The [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] language supports class ''properties'', which provide a means to define {{code|get}} and {{code|set}} operations (''getters'' and ''setters'') for a member variable. The syntax to access or modify the property is the same as accessing any other class member variable, but the actual implementation for doing so can be defined as either a simple read/write access or as functional code.
&lt;source lang="C#"&gt;
class Foo
{
    // Property
    int Size
    {
        get;    // Getter
        set;    // Setter
    }

    // Property
    string Name
    {
        get { return name_; }     // Getter
        set { name_ = value; }    // Setter
    }

    private string  name_;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example above, class {{code|Foo}} contains two properties, {{code|Size}} and {{code|Name}}. The {{code|Size}} property is an integer that can be read (get) and written (set). Similarly, the {{code|Name}} property is a string that can also be read and modified, but its value is stored in a separate (private) class variable {{code|name_}}.

Omitting the {{code|set}} operation in a property definition makes the property read-only, while omitting the {{code|get}} operation makes it write-only.

Use of the properties employs the UAP, as shown in the code below.
&lt;source lang="C#"&gt;
    Foo MakeFoo(int mySize, string myName)
    {
        Foo  myFoo = new Foo();
        myFoo.Size = mySize;       // Property setter
        myFoo.Name = myName;       // Property setter
        return myFoo;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

=== C++ ===
	 	
[[C++]] has neither the UAP nor properties, when an object is changed such that an attribute (color) becomes a pair of functions (getA, setA). Any place in that uses an instance of the object and either sets or gets the attribute value ( x = obj.color or obj.color= x) must be changed to invoke one of the functions. ( x = obj.getColor() or obj.setColor(x)). Using templates and operator overloading, it is possible to fake properties, but this is more complex than in languages which directly support properties. This complicates maintenance of C++ programs. Distributed libraries of C++ objects must be careful about how they provide access to member data.

The '''white-flippered penguin''' (''Eudyptula minor albosignata'') is a small penguin about {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} tall and weighing {{convert|1.5|kg|abbr=on}}. It gains its name from the white markings on its [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s, unique to the [[subspecies]]. It nests only on [[Banks Peninsula]] and [[Motunau Island]], near [[Canterbury Region|Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]], with only around 3,750 breeding pairs.

==Taxonomy==
The white-flippered penguin is currently considered by most [[taxonomists]] to be a colour [[morph (zoology)|morph]] or subspecies of the [[little penguin]] (''E. minor''). Analysis of [[mtDNA]] in 2002 revealed two [[clade]]s in ''[[Eudyptula]]'': one containing little penguins of New Zealand's [[North Island]], [[Cook Strait]] and [[Chatham Island]], as well as the white-flippered penguin, and a second containing little penguins of Australia and the southeastern coast of New Zealand's [[South Island]].&lt;ref name=Banks&gt;Banks, Jonathan C.; Mitchell, Anthony D.; Waas, Joseph R. &amp; Paterson, Adrian M. (2002): An unexpected pattern of molecular divergence within the blue penguin (''Eudyptula minor'') complex. ''Notornis'' '''49'''(1): 29–38. [http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_49_1_29.pdf PDF fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary analysis of braying calls and [[cluster analysis]] of [[morphometrics]] partially supported these results.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt; In 2008, [[Hadoram Shirihai|Shirihai]] treated the little penguin and white-flippered penguin as [[allospecies]].&lt;ref&gt;Shirihai, Hadoram (2008). The Complete Guide to Antarctic Wildlife, 2d Edition. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2012, the [[IUCN]] and [[BirdLife International]] consider the white-flippered penguin to be a subspecies or morph of the little penguin.

==Habitat==
White-flippered penguins live in [[headland]]s, [[caves]], rock jumbles, and in the sheltered areas at the bases of bays. They are found mostly in [[Canterbury Region|Canterbury]], New Zealand.

==General behaviour==
White-flippered penguins are primarily [[nocturnal]] animals on land and are unique among penguins in this respect. They differ from other penguins in that they stay with the [[Bird colony|colony]] during the day, and then leave under the cover of darkness and return before dawn. However, on Banks Peninsula, some birds can be observed on land outside their [[burrow]]s during daylight.

In the evening, these penguins tend to assemble offshore in groups until light levels are low enough for them to feel sufficiently safe to head inland. This results in large batches of birds arriving at one time.

==Breeding==
The white-flippered penguin lays its [[bird egg|eggs]] from July to December, with most egg-laying occurring August through November. The eggs are always laid in burrows under tree brush almost like nests; they are also laid in [[dune]]s, or on vegetated slopes, and are incubated for 33 to 39 days. Chicks [[fledge]] after 50 to 65 days.

==Feeding==
The white-flippered penguin feeds on small [[shoal]]ing fish, such as [[pilchards]] and [[anchovies]], or [[cephalopods]], and less often on [[crustaceans]]. It catches its food by pursuit diving. Most feeding takes place within {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} of the coast with daily round trips. The farthest trip out to sea for food was {{convert|75|km|abbr=on}} offshore.

==Conservation==
In August 2010 the white-flippered penguin was listed as endangered under the US [[Endangered Species Act]].&lt;ref name=Penguin&gt;[http://www.seaturtles.org/article.php?id=1742 Five Penguins Win U.S. Endangered Species Act Protection]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Motunau Beach Biodiversity Development Team are working on a conservation project for white-flippered penguins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/motunaubeachbiodiversity/ Motunau Beach Biodiversity]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wisconsin model''' of socio-economic attainment is a model that describes and explains an individual's [[social mobility]] and its economic, social, and psychological determinants. The logistics of this model are primarily attributed to [[William H. Sewell]], as well as his colleagues Archibald Haller and [[Alejandro Portes]]. The model receives its name from the state in which a significant amount of the research and analysis was completed. Unlike the previous research on this topic by [[Peter Blau]] and [[Otis Dudley Duncan]], this model encompasses more than just educational and occupational factors and their effect on social mobility for American males.

==Prior research==
Before the framework for the Wisconsin model was constructed, Peter Blau and Otis Duncan established the first model of social mobility of its kind. However, the Blau-Duncan model was made up of only five predictors. These included father's education and occupation, the individual's education and first job, and the individual's job several years later.

==Purpose==
Sewell and his counterparts aimed to contribute to the Blau-Duncan model of status attainment by adding predictor variables. Because the results given by the Blau-Duncan model were based heavily on "structural factors as explanatory variables", the Wisconsin model was created to account for "social-psychological factors on educational and occupational attainment", which in turn, provided more accurate prediction. These variables, in turn, came from analyses done by Sewell and Haller in the 1950s and published (with Sewell's agreement) by Haller and Miller (1963, 1971). The latter work includes the theory on which the psychosociological variables of the WM are based.&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter B., and Otis Dudley Duncan, 1967 THE AMERICAN OCCUPATIONAL STRUCTURE. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter B., and Otis Dudley Duncan, 1963 THE OCCUPATIONAL ASPIRATION SCALE: THEORY, STRUCTURE AND CORRELATES. East Lansing: Michigan State University Agricultural Experiment Station Technical Bulletin 288. 1971, 2nd Edition—Schenkman: Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model variables==
The model consisted of eight characteristics that most effectively linked socio-economic background and status attainment. These included occupational attainment, educational attainment, level of occupational aspiration, level of educational aspiration, the influence of significant others, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and mental ability.

===Occupational attainment===
Measured by Otis Dudley Duncan's socio-economic index of occupational status.

===Educational attainment===
Achieved by assigning a point value to certain levels of education that a subject has reached. In more recent studies using this model, educational attainment was classified into four levels: no post high school education, vocational school, college attendance, and a college degree. Earlier studies only classified subjects into those who went to college and those who did not.

===Level of occupational aspiration===
The subject's level is calculated by again categorizing Duncan's socioeconomic index scores in association with the occupation that the subject hope to hold in the future.

===Level of educational aspiration===
This is classified by the education level that each subject originally indicates that they hope to secure. Once again, some recent studies have assigned point values for three levels of desired education level: not continuing education after high school, vocational school, or college. Previous studies only categorized students based on which type institution they planned on attending prior to high school graduation.

===Significant others' influence===
This variable can be determined by evaluating three perceptions of the subject including: parental and teacher encouragement to attend college, as well as friends' college plans. Additional work regarding the influence of significant others on occupational aspirations was subsequently done by Haller and is students [[Joseph Woelfel]] and Ed L. Fink.&lt;ref&gt;Haller, Archibald O., [[Joseph Woelfel|Woelfel, J.]], and Fink, E. L. (1968). The Wisconsin Significant Other Battery: Construction, Validation, and Reliability Tests of Questionnaire Instruments to Identify 'Significant Others' and Measure Their Educational and Occupational Expectations for High School Youth. Final Report. http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED035990.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Sewell, Haller and Portes article Sewell which first reported the broad outlines of the Wisconsin model relied on data from a statewide survey of all Wisconsin high school seniors that included information about whether students perceived their parents, teachers and friends as expecting them to go to college.&lt;ref&gt;Sewell, W., &amp; Haller, A., &amp; Portes, A. (1969). The educational and early occupational attainment process. In American sociological review (34) 1, 82-92. American Sociological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Later work initiated by Archie O. Haller and implemented by [[Joseph Woelfel]] and Edward L. Fink was able to survey adolescent students and identify the specific persons who communicated most with them about education and occupation, and who served as examples for their own educational and occupational futures. The "Significant Other Project" also produced survey instruments which identified the specific [[significant other]]s for educational and occupational aspirations and measured their educational and occupational aspirations for the students&lt;ref&gt;Haller, A., &amp; Woelfel, J. (1972). Significant others and their expectations: Concepts and instruments to measure interpersonal influence on status aspirations. Rural Sociology, 37(4), 591-622&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic performance===
This value is calculated by the subject's high school class rank.

===Socioeconomic status===
In the original study, socio-economic status was determined by a weighted combination of mother's and father's education, father's occupation, and average annual income from 1957-1960.

===Mental ability===
This variable is determined by the analysis of standardized testing. In previous studies, statewide test results for high school juniors and seniors are compared with state intelligence norms.

==Effects of social psychology and stratification research on the process of status attainment==

===Interpersonal influence===
Primarily, the significant others' direct influence on the subject specifically relates to one's educational and occupational aspirations and also educational attainment. Basically, this implies that those who are constantly involved with a subject (mother, father, friend) will have a direct outcome on what type of education the subject receives.

===Self-reflexive action===
Essentially, this implies that a person's status attainment can only be limited by one's own "perceived ability". Social structural factors, however, determine the expectations of an individual's significant others—which then influence the person's attitudes. These attitudes  themselves then exert directive forces over both academic performance and later educational and occupational attainments.&lt;ref&gt;Woelfel, J., &amp; Haller, A. (1971). Significant others: The self-reflexive act and the attitude formation process. American Sociological Review, 36(1), 74-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status aspirations===
One's desire to attain status is an obligation for educational and occupational attainment.

==Resulting hypotheses==
Because this model organizes how status aspirations are formed and the way in which they influence "attainment-oriented behavior" the following conclusions can be drawn from the model:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Status aspirations are complex forms of attitudes whose translation into attainment levels is affected by the context in which individuals attempt to enact them."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Attitudes - including levels of aspiration - are formed and altered through two basic mechanisms; interpersonal influence, including reflexive adjustment of others' expectations, and including self-reflexion."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Youth is an experience that may shape an individual's level of dependency, which can be marked in various ways according to different cultural perspectives. Personal experience is marked by an individual's cultural norms or traditions, while a youth's level of dependency means the extent to which he still relies on his family emotionally and economically.&lt;ref name=Furlong1/&gt;

=== General ===
Around the world, the [[English language|English]] terms ''youth'', ''[[Adolescence|adolescent]]'', ''teenager'', ''kid'', and ''young person'' are interchanged, often meaning the same thing,&lt;ref&gt;Konopka, Gisela. (1973) [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ087128 "Requirements for Healthy Development of Adolescent Youth"], ''Adolescence''. '''8''' (31), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; but they are occasionally differentiated. ''Youth'' can be referred to as the time of life when one is young. This involves childhood, and the time of life which is neither childhood nor adulthood, but rather somewhere in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/youth|title=Youth dictionary definition – youth defined|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Youth'' also identifies a particular mindset of attitude, as in "He is very ''youth''ful". For certain uses, such as employment statistics, the term also sometimes refers to individuals from the ages of 14 to 21.&lt;ref&gt;Altschuler, D.; Strangler, G.; Berkley, K.; Burton, L. (2009); [http://cjjr.georgetown.edu/pdfs/TransitionPaperFinal.pdf "Supporting Youth in Transition to Adulthood: Lessons Learned from Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916235341/http://cjjr.georgetown.edu/pdfs/TransitionPaperFinal.pdf |date=September 16, 2012 }}. Center for Juvenile Justice Reform.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term ''adolescence'' refers to a specific age range during a specific developmental period in a person's life, unlike youth which is a socially constructed category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Youth Studies, An Introduction|last = Furlong|first = Andy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Milton Park, Abingdon|pages = 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] defines ''youth'' as persons between the ages of 15 and 24 with all UN statistics based on this range, the UN states education as a source for these statistics. The [[UN]] also recognizes that this varies without prejudice to other age groups listed by member states such as 18–30. A useful distinction within the UN itself can be made between teenagers (i.e. those between the ages of 13 and 19) and young adults (those between the ages of 18 and 32). While seeking to impose some uniformity on statistical approaches, the UN itself is aware of contradictions between approaches in its own statutes. Hence under the 15–24 definition (introduced in 1981) children are defined as those under the age of 14 while under the 1979 Convention on the [[Rights of the Child]], those under the age of 18 are regarded as children.&lt;ref name=Furlong2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=USA|isbn=978-0-415-56476-2|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN also states they are aware that several definitions exist for [https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/documents/youth/fact-sheets/youth-definition.pdf youth within UN entities] such as [http://unhabitat.org/ Youth Habitat 15–32] and African Youth Charter 15–35.

Although linked to biological processes of development and aging, ''youth'' is also defined as a [[social position]] that reflects the meanings different cultures and societies give to individuals between childhood and adulthood. The term in itself when referred to in a manner of social position, can be ambiguous when applied to someone of an older age with very low social position; potentially when still dependent on their guardians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Youth Studies: An Introduction|last = Furlong|first = Andy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0415564793|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars argue that age-based definitions have not been consistent across cultures or times and that thus it is more accurate to focus on social processes in the transition to adult independence for defining youth.&lt;ref name="Tyyska"&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary Youth Research: Local Expressions and Global Connections|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXuqQ_hueXQC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;ots=17-MF_s9yw&amp;dq=Conceptualizing%20and%20theorizing%20youth%3A%20Global%20perspectives&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=0-7546-4161-9|publisher=Ashgate Books|location=London|year=2005|author=Tyyskä, Vappu|chapter=Conceptualizing and Theorizing Youth: Global Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"This world demands the qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the life of ease." – Robert Kennedy&lt;ref&gt;[http://rfkcenter.org/lifevision/dayofaffirmation/ "Day of Affirmation, University of Cape Town, South Africa. June 6, 1966"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227110620/http://rfkcenter.org/lifevision/dayofaffirmation/ |date=February 27, 2011 }}, Robert F. Kennedy Memorial. Retrieved 11/9/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth is the stage of constructing the [[self-concept]]. The self-concept of youth is influenced by variables such as peers, lifestyle, gender, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, A. (2003) "Psychology of Adolescents", ''Self-Concept, Weight Issues and Body Image in Children and Adolescents'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a time of a person's life when their choices are most likely to affect their future.&lt;ref&gt;Wing, John, Jr. "Youth."

=== Other definitions ===

In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the term "youth" is associated with young men from 15 to 30 or 35 years of age. [[Youth in Nigeria]] includes all members of the Federal Republic of Nigeria aged 18–35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigeria 2009 National Youth Policy|url=https://www.k4health.org/toolkits/youthpolicy/nigeria-national-youth-policy-and-strategic-plan-action}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many African girls experience youth as a brief interlude between the onset of [[puberty]] and [[marriage]] and [[motherhood]]. But in urban settings, poor women are often considered youth much longer, even if they bear children outside of marriage. Varying culturally, the gender constructions of youth in Latin America and Southeast Asia differ from those of sub-Saharan Africa. In Vietnam, widespread notions of youth are sociopolitical constructions for both sexes between the ages of 15 and 35.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dalsgaard, Anne Line Hansen, Karen Tranberg. "Youth and the City in the Global South" In Tracking Globalization. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. 2008: 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], the term ''youth'' refers to people of both sexes from 15 to 29 years old. This age bracket reflects the influence on Brazilian law of international organizations like the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). It is also shaped by the notion of adolescence that has entered everyday life in Brazil through a discourse on children's rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The intergovernmental organization [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] defines ''youth'' as "those between 15 and 29 years of age".&lt;ref&gt;.OECD.org.[http://www.oecd.org/youth.htm ''OECD work on Youth''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.OECD Family Database [https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/CO_3_5_Young_people_not_in_education_or_employment.pdf ''Young people not in education or employment''].&lt;/ref&gt;

August 12 was declared [[International Youth Day]] by the United Nations.

==Youth rights==
{{Main article|Youth rights}}
{{Youth rights sidebar}}
[[Children's rights]] cover all the rights that belong to children. When they grow up they are granted with new rights (like voting, consent, driving, etc.) and duties (criminal response, etc.). There are different [[minimum]] limits of age at which youth are not free, independent or legally competent to take some decisions or actions. Some of these limits are [[voting age]], [[age of candidacy]], [[age of consent]], [[age of majority]], [[age of criminal responsibility]], [[drinking age]], [[driving age]], etc. After youth reach these limits they are free to vote, have sexual intercourse, buy or consume alcohol beverages or drive [[cars]], etc.

===Voting age===
{{Main article|Voting age}}
[[Voting age]] is the [[minimum age]] established by law that a person must attain to be eligible to [[Suffrage|vote in a public election]]. Typically, the age is set at 18 years; however, ages as low as 16 and as high as 21 exist (see list below). Studies show that 21% of all 18 year olds have experience with voting. This is an important right since, by voting they can support politics selected by themselves and not only by people of older generations.

===Age of candidacy===
{{Main article|Age of candidacy}}
'''Age of candidacy''' is the minimum age at which a person can legally qualify to hold certain elected government offices. In many cases, it also determines the age at which a person may be [[nomination rules|eligible to stand]] for an election or be granted [[ballot access]].

===Age of consent===
{{Main article|Age of consent}}
The [[age of consent]] is the age at which a person is considered [[legally competent]] to consent to [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]], and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity. The distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim, and their sex partner as the offender.

=== Defense of infancy ===
{{Main article|Defense of infancy}}
The [[defense of infancy]] is a form of [[defense (legal)|defense]] known as an [[excuse]] so that [[defendant]]s falling within the definition of an "[[infant]]" are excluded from [[crime|criminal]] [[legal liability|liability]] for their [[action (philosophy)|action]]s, if at the relevant time, they had not reached an '''age of criminal responsibility'''. This implies that children lack the judgment that comes with age and experience to be held criminally responsible. After reaching the initial age, there may be levels of responsibility dictated by age and the type of offense committed.

=== Drinking age ===
{{Main article|Drinking age}}
The [[Drinking age|legal drinking age]] is the age at which a person can consume or purchase [[alcoholic beverage]]s. These laws cover a wide range of issues and behaviors, addressing when and where alcohol can be consumed. The minimum age alcohol can be legally consumed can be different from the age when it can be purchased in some countries. These laws vary among different countries and many laws have exemptions or special circumstances. Most laws apply only to drinking alcohol in public places, with alcohol consumption in the home being mostly unregulated (an exception being the UK, which has a minimum legal age of five for supervised consumption in private places).  Some countries also have different age limits for different types of alcoholic drinks.&lt;ref name="Icap Reports 4"&gt;[http://www.icap.org/portals/0/download/all_pdfs/icap_reports_english/report4.pdf Drinking Age Limits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120062253/http://www.icap.org/portals/0/download/all_pdfs/icap_reports_english/report4.pdf |date=2013-01-20 }} – International Center for Alcohol Policies&lt;/ref&gt;

===Driving age===
{{Main article|Driving age}}
[[Driving age]] is the age at which a person can apply for a [[driver's license]]. Countries with the lowest driving ages (below 17) are Australia, Canada, El Salvador, Iceland, Israel, Estonia, Macedonia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Sweden, the United Kingdom (Mainland) and United States. The Canadian province of Alberta and several U.S. states permit youth driving as low as 14. [[Niger]] has the highest minimum driving age in the world at 23. In India, driving is legal after getting a license at the age of 18.

===Legal working age===
{{Main article|Legal working age}}
{{See also|Right to work}}
The '''legal working age''' is the minimum age required by [[law]] for a person to work, in each [[country]] or [[jurisdiction]]. The threshold of adulthood, or  "the [[age of majority]]" as recognized or declared in law in most countries has been set at age 18.  Some types of labor are commonly prohibited even for those above the working age, if they have not reached yet the [[age of majority]]. Activities that are dangerous, [[harmful]] to the [[health]] or that may affect the [[morals]] of [[Minor (law)|minors]] fall into this category.

===Student rights in higher education===
{{Main article|Student rights in higher education}}
[[Student rights]] are those [[rights]], such as civil, constitutional, contractual and consumer rights, which regulate student rights and freedoms and allow [[student]]s to make use of their educational investment. These include such things as the right to free speech and association, to due process, equality, autonomy, safety and privacy, and accountability in contracts and advertising, which regulate the treatment of students by teachers and administrators.

=== Smoking age ===
{{Main article|Smoking age}}
The smoking age is the minimum age a person can buy tobacco, and/or smoke in public. Most countries regulate this law at the national level while at some it is done by the state or province.

==Socioeconomic issues==
The growth of [[youth unemployment]], which reached new heights of 22.5% across the European Union, as well as the precarisation of labor market conditions reveals that the gap between labor market 'outsiders' and 'insiders' is widening. One of the most dramatic possible consequences of this growing divergence could arguably be the disenfranchisement of labour market outsiders, especially young people, from social and political participation (Ferragina et al. 2016).&lt;ref&gt; Emanuele Ferragina et al.(2016). ''Outsiderness and participation in liberal market economies.'' PACO The Open Journal of Sociopolitical Studies, 9, 986–1014  https://scholar.google.fr/scholar_url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsiba-ese.unisalento.it%2Findex.php%2Fpaco%2Farticle%2Fdownload%2F16664%2F14327&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=T&amp;ei=AN-iWPD-EIupmAHrx5vACw&amp;scisig=AAGBfm3_dOCLibWFNHNtG62FKywcq7PxNA&amp;nossl=1&amp;ws=1920x909&lt;/ref&gt; If the objective of policymakers is to revive social and political participation in a period of great disenchantment and declining legitimacy for our democracies, there is definitely scope for further enquiry and action into the effects of youth outsiderness on social and political participation.

== School and education ==
{{Main article|Schooling}}

Young people spend much of their lives in educational settings, and their experiences in schools, colleges and universities can shape much of their subsequent lives.&lt;ref name=Furlong3&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=USA|isbn=978-0-415-56476-2|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that poverty and income affect the likelihood for the incompletion of high school. These factors also increase the likelihood for the youth to not go to a college or university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Njapa-Minyard|first=Pamela|title=After-school Programs: Attracting and Sustaining Youth Participation|journal=International Journal of Learning|year=2010|volume=17|issue=9|pages=177–182|url=http://ijl.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.30/prod.2958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, 12.3 percent of young people ages 16 to 24 are disconnected, meaning they are neither in school nor working.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Burd-Sharps and Kristen Lewis.

===Health and mortality===
The leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults are due to certain health-risk behaviors. These behaviors are often established during youth and extend into adulthood. Since the risk behaviors in adulthood and youth are interrelated, problems in adulthood are preventable by influencing youth behavior.

A 2004 [[Death|mortality]] study of youth (defined in this study as ages 10–24) mortality worldwide found that 97% of deaths occurred in low to middle-income countries, with the majority in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Maternal conditions accounted for 15% of female deaths, while [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[tuberculosis]] were responsible for 11% of [[death]]s; 14% of male and 5% of female deaths were attributed to traffic accidents, the largest cause overall. Violence accounted for 12% of male deaths. [[Suicide]] was the cause of 6% of all deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global patterns of mortality in young people: a systematic analysis of population health data|journal=The Lancet|date=September 2009|volume=374|issue=9693|pages=881–892|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60741-8|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2809%2960741-8/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] developed its Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) in 2003 to help assess risk behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/brief.htm|title=This page has been redirected|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; YRBSS monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults. These are behaviors that contribute to unintentional [[injuries]] and [[violence]];
* [[Youth smoking|tobacco]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and other [[Substance abuse|drug use]];
* [[sexual behaviors]] that contribute to [[unintended pregnancy]] and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]) infection;
* unhealthy dietary behaviors;
* [[physical inactivity]]—plus [[overweight]].

YRBSS includes a national school-based survey conducted by CDC as well as state and local school-based surveys conducted by education and health agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Grunbaum, J.A., Kann, L., Kinchen, S., Ross, J., Hawkins, J., Lowry, R., Harris, W.A., McManus, T., Chyen, D., Collins, J. (2004) Youth risk behavior surveillance—United States, 2003. ''Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Surveillance Summaries'', 53(2), 1–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obesity===
{{main article|Childhood obesity}}
[[Obesity]] now affects one in five children in the United States, and is the most prevalent nutritional disease of children and adolescents in the United States. Although obesity-associated morbidities occur more frequently in adults, significant consequences of obesity as well as the antecedents of adult disease occur in obese children and adolescents.

Discrimination against overweight children begins early in childhood and becomes progressively institutionalized. Obese children may be taller than their non-overweight peers, in which case they are apt to be viewed as more mature. The inappropriate expectations that result may have an adverse effect on their socialization.

Many of the cardiovascular consequences that characterize adult-onset obesity are preceded by abnormalities that begin in childhood. [[Hyperlipidemia]], [[hypertension]], and abnormal [[glucose tolerance]] occur with increased frequency in obese children and adolescents. The relationship of cardiovascular risk factors to visceral fat independent of total body fat remains unclear. [[Sleep apnea]], [[pseudotumor cerebri]], and [[Blount's disease]] represent major sources of morbidity for which rapid and sustained weight reduction is essential. Although several periods of increased risk appear in childhood, it is not clear whether obesity with onset early in childhood carries a greater risk of adult morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;William, H. (1998) Health Consequences of Obesity in Youth: Childhood Predictors of Adult Disease, ''Pediatrics'', 101(2), 518–525.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bullying===
[[Bullying]] among school-aged youth is increasingly being recognized as an important problem affecting well-being and social functioning. While a certain amount of conflict and harassment is typical of youth peer relations, bullying presents a potentially more serious threat to healthy youth development. The definition of bullying is widely agreed on in literature on bullying.&lt;ref&gt;Boulton MJ, Underwood K. Bully/victim problems among middle school children. Br J Educ Psychol.1992;62:73–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olweus D. Aggression in the Schools: Bullies and Whipping Boys.

Bullying in the playground: the impact of inter-personal violence on Australian children's perceptions of their play environment.  Child Environ.1995;12:320–327.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of research on bullying has been conducted in Europe and Australia.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Considerable variability among countries in the prevalence of bullying has been reported. In an international survey of adolescent health-related behaviors, the percentage of students who reported being bullied at least once during the current term ranged from a low of 15% to 20% in some countries to a high of 70% in others.&lt;ref&gt;King A, Wold B, Tudor-Smith C, Harel Y.

Washington, DC: US Dept of Education; 1999:1–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular concern is frequent bullying, typically defined as bullying that occurs once a week or more. The prevalence of frequent bullying reported internationally ranges from a low of 1.9% among one Irish sample to a high of 19% in a Malta study.&lt;ref&gt;Borg MG.

Research examining characteristics of youth involved in bullying has consistently found that both bullies and those bullied demonstrate poorer [[psychosocial]] functioning than their non-involved peers. Youth who bully others tend to demonstrate higher levels of conduct problems and dislike of school, whereas youth who are bullied generally show higher levels of [[Emotional insecurity|insecurity]], [[anxiety]], [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]], [[loneliness]], [[unhappiness]], physical and mental symptoms, and low [[self-esteem]]. Males who are bullied also tend to be physically weaker than males in general. The few studies that have examined the characteristics of youth who both bully and are bullied found that these individuals exhibit the poorest psychosocial functioning overall.&lt;ref&gt;Austin S, Joseph S.

===Sexual health and politics===

====General====

[[Globalization]] and transnational flows have had tangible effects on sexual relations, identities, and subjectivities. In the wake of an increasingly globalized world order under waning Western dominance, within ideologies of modernity, civilization, and programs for social improvement, discourses on [[Human population control|population control]], '[[safe sex]]', and '[[Sexual and reproductive health and rights|sexual rights]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Petchesky, R. (2000) 'Sexual rights: inventing a concept, mapping an international practice,' in R. Parker, R.M. Barbosa and P. Aggleton (eds), ''Framing the sexual subject: The politics of Gender, Sexuality and Power'', Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 81–103&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sex education]] programmes grounded in evidence-based approaches are a cornerstone in reducing adolescent sexual risk behaviours and promoting sexual health. In addition to providing accurate information about consequences of [[Sexually transmitted disease]] or STIs and early pregnancy, such programmes build life skills for interpersonal communication and decision making. Such programmes are most commonly implemented in schools, which reach large numbers of teenagers in areas where school enrollment rates are high. However, since not all young people are in school, sex education programmes have also been implemented in clinics, juvenile detention centers and youth-oriented community agencies. Notably, some programmes have been found to reduce risky sexual behaviours when implemented in both school and community settings with only minor modifications to the curricula.&lt;ref&gt;Bearinger, Linda H., et al. 2007. "Global perspectives on the sexual and reproductive health of adelescents: patterns, prevention, and potential." ''The Lancet 369.9568: 1226''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Philippines ====
The [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] ("Youth Council" in [[English language|English]]), commonly known as SK, was a youth council in each [[barangay]] (village or district) in the [[Philippines]], before being put "on hold", but not quite abolished, prior to the [[Philippine barangay elections, 2013|2013 barangay elections]].&lt;ref name=SunStarMar14&gt;{{cite news|last=Catajan|first=Maria Elena|title=NYC: Use SK funds right|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/baguio/local-news/2014/03/24/nyc-use-sk-funds-right-334774|accessdate=26 March 2014|newspaper=SunStar Baguio|date=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The council represented teenagers from 15 to 17 years old who have resided in their barangay for at least six months and registered to vote. It was the local youth legislature in the village and therefore led the local youth program and projects of the government. The Sangguniang Kabataan was an offshoot of the KB or the ''Kabataang Barangay'' (Village Youth) which was abolished when the [[Local Government Code]] of 1991 was enacted.

==In the Global South==

The vast majority of young people live in [[Developing country|developing countries]]: according to the UN, globally around 85 per cent of 15- to 25-year-olds live in developing countries, a figure projected to grow 89.5 per cent by 2025. Moreover, this majority are extremely diverse: some live in rural areas but many inhabit the overcrowded metropolises of [[India]], [[Youth in Mongolia|Mongolia]] and other parts of Asia and in South America, some live traditional lives in [[tribal societies]], while others participate in global youth culture in [[ghetto]] contexts.&lt;ref name=Furlong4&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=USA|isbn=978-0-415-56476-2|pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many young lives in developing countries are defined by poverty, some suffer from famine and a lack of clean water, while involvement in armed conflict is all common. Health problems are rife, especially due to the prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS]] in certain regions. The [[United Nations]] estimates that 200 million young people live in poverty, 130 million are illiterate and 10 million live with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Furlong4/&gt;
