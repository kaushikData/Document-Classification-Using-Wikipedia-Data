      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3136">The '''1992 Colombian energy crisis''' was a crisis of the Colombian energy sector during the presidency of [[César Gaviria]], from May 2, 1992, to February 7, 1993, caused by [[El Niño]]. El Niño caused droughts across much of the country, which lowered reservoir levels at many of its principal hydroelectric dams and a further crisis within the state public services company, Interconexión Eléctrica, S.A. (ISA).

==Causes==
El Niño occurs when warm waters originating off the coast of Australia reach South American shores. This causes significant variation in marine climates and droughts and floods. The 1992 El Niño, which produced droughts in Colombia, coincided with infrastructure problems within the nation's hydroelectric power facilities.&lt;ref name="ElTiempo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-104700|title=A adelantar los relojes!|newspaper=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]|date=May 1, 1992|accessdate=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationing==
The government under president [[César Gaviria]] opted to take action, introducing a rationing program. On March 2, 1992, the government announced scheduled power cuts, of up to nine hours in cities such as [[Bogotá]] and up to 18 hours on the islands of [[San Andrés y Providencia]]. Public awareness campaigns were launched under the name ''"Cierre la llave"'' ("Turn Off the Tap"), hoping to measure how much water was being wasted. In the city of [[Cali]], a decree was passed setting six days in prison as a penalty for heavy water users.

==="Hora Gaviria"===
As a further measure, Gaviria changed Colombia's time zone from [[UTC-5]] to [[UTC-4]], which was then the time zone of neighboring [[Venezuela]], beginning on Saturday, May 2, 1992, at 1:00 am.&lt;ref name="ElTiempo"/&gt; The measure came to be known as ''"Hora Gaviria"'' ("Gaviria Time"). Of Colombia's 1,024 municipalities, 1,000 declined to change time zones and took months to come into effect. The time zone change was ended on February 7, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-32922|title=La hora se pone al día|newspaper=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]|date=February 4, 1993|accessdate=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impacts==
One of two most popular [[telenovela]]s of 1992 in Colombia, ''[[En cuerpo ajeno]]'', was moved from 8pm to 10pm on [[Canal Uno (Colombia)|Cadena Uno]], then a highly unusual timeslot for flagship novelas on Colombian television, so that more viewers could see it when they were not impacted by energy rationing (the blackouts in Bogotá ended at 9 pm). The other popular telenovela, ''[[Sangre de Lobos]]'', was already being broadcast at 10pm on [[Canal A]]. [[Caracol Radio]] created a program, ''La Luciérnaga'' ("The Firefly"), for the early evening hours when power cuts were in effect in many areas; as of 2015, the program remains on the air.

In [[ecology]], the theory of '''alternative stable states''' (sometimes termed '''alternate stable states''' or '''alternative stable equilibria''') predicts that [[ecosystems]] can exist under multiple "states" (sets of unique biotic and abiotic conditions). These alternative states are non-transitory and therefore considered stable over ecologically-relevant timescales. Ecosystems may transition from one stable state to another, in what is known as a state shift (sometimes termed a [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]] or [[regime shift]]), when [[Disturbance (ecology)|perturbed]]. Due to ecological feedbacks, ecosystems display resistance to state shifts and therefore tend to remain in one state unless perturbations are large enough. Multiple states may persist under equal environmental conditions, a phenomenon known as [[hysteresis]]. '''Alternative stable state''' theory suggests that discrete states are separated by [[ecological threshold]]s, in contrast to ecosystems which change smoothly and continuously along an [[environmental gradient]].

== Theory ==

Alternative stable state theory was first proposed by [[Richard Lewontin]] (1969), but other early key authors include [[C. S. Holling|Holling]] (1973), Sutherland (1974), [[R. M. May|May]] (1977), and [[Marten Scheffer|Scheffer]] et al. (2001). In the broadest sense, alternative stable state theory proposes that a change in ecosystem conditions can result in an abrupt shift in the state of the ecosystem, such as a change in population (Barange, M. et al. 2008) or community composition. Ecosystems can persist in states that are considered stable (i.e., can exist for relatively long periods of time). Intermediate states are considered unstable and are, therefore, transitory. Because ecosystems are resistant to state shifts, significant perturbations are usually required to overcome ecological thresholds and cause shifts from one stable state to another. The resistance to state shifts is known as "[[ecological resilience|resilience]]" (Holling 1973).

State shifts are often illustrated heuristically by the ball-in-cup model (Holling, C.S. et al., 1995) Biodiversity in the functioning of ecosystems: an ecological synthesis. In Biodiversity Loss, Ecological and Economical Issues (Perrings, C.A. et al., eds), pp.&amp;nbsp;44–83, Cambridge University Press). A ball, representing the ecosystem, exists on a surface where any point along the surface represents a possible state. In the simplest model, the landscape consists of two valleys separated by a hill. When the ball is in a valley, or a "domain of attraction", it exists in a stable state and must be perturbed to move from this state. In the absence of perturbations, the ball will always roll downhill and therefore will tend to stay in the valley (or stable state). State shifts can be viewed from two different viewpoints, the "community perspective" and the "ecosystem perspective". The ball can only move between stable states in two ways: (1) moving the ball or (2) altering the landscape. The community perspective is analogous to moving the ball, while the ecosystem perspective is analogous to altering the landscape.

These two viewpoints consider the same phenomenon with different mechanisms. The community perspective considers ecosystem variables (which change relatively quickly and are subject to feedbacks from the system), whereas the ecosystem perspective considers ecosystem parameters (which change relatively slowly and operate independently of the system). The community context considers a relatively constant environment in which multiple stable states are accessible to populations or communities. This definition is an extension of stability analysis of populations (e.g., Lewontin 1969; Sutherland 1973) and communities (e.g., Drake 1991; Law and Morton 1993). The ecosystem context focuses on the effect of exogenic "drivers" on communities or ecosystems (e.g., May 1977; Scheffer et al. 2001; Dent et al. 2002). Both definitions are explored within this article.

== Ecological community ==

Ecosystems can shift from one state to another via a significant perturbation directly to [[state variable]]s. State variables are quantities that change quickly (in ecologically-relevant time scales) in response to feedbacks from the system (i.e., they are dependent on system feedbacks), such as [[Population density|population densities]]. This perspective requires that different states can exist simultaneously under equal environmental conditions, since the ball moves only in response to a state variable change.

For example, consider a very simple system with three microbial species. It may be possible for the system to exist under different community structure regimes depending on [[Initial value problem|initial conditions]] (e.g., population densities or spatial arrangement of individuals) (Kerr et al. 2002). Perhaps under certain initial densities or spatial configurations, one species dominates over all others, while under different initial conditions all species can mutually coexist. Because the different species interact, changes in populations affect one another synergistically to determine community structure. Under both states the environmental conditions are identical. Because the states have resilience, following small perturbations (e.g., changes to [[population size]]) the community returns to the same configuration while large perturbations may induce a shift to another configuration.

The community perspective requires the existence of alternative stable states (i.e., more than one valley) before the perturbation, since the landscape is not changing. Because communities have some level of [[Change management|resistance to change]], they will stay in their domain of attraction (or stable state) until the perturbation is large enough to force the system into another state. In the ball-and-cup model, this would be the energy required to push the ball up and over a hill, where it would fall downhill into a different valley.

== Ecosystem ==

It is also possible to cause state shifts in another context, by indirectly affecting [[state variable]]s. This is known as the ecosystem perspective. This perspective requires a change in environmental parameters that affect the behavior of state variables. For example, [[birth rate]], [[Mortality rate|death rate]], migration, and density-dependent predation indirectly alter the ecosystem state by changing population density (a state variable). Ecosystem parameters are quantities that are unresponsive (or respond very slowly) to feedbacks from the system (i.e., they are independent of system feedbacks). The stable state landscape is changed by environmental drivers, which may result in a change in the quantity of stable states and the relationship between states.

By the ecosystem perspective, the landscape of the ecological states is changed, which forces a change in the ecosystem state. Changing the landscape can modify the number, location, and resilience of stable states, as well as the unstable intermediate states. By this view, the topography in the ball-and-cup model is not static, as it is in the community perspective. This is a fundamental difference between the two perspectives.

Although the mechanisms of community and ecosystem perspectives are different, the [[Empirical research|empirical evidence]] required for documentation of alternative stable states is the same. In addition, state shifts are often a combination of internal processes and external forces (Scheffer et al. 2001). For example, consider a stream-fed lake in which the pristine state is dominated by benthic vegetation. When upstream construction releases soils into the stream, the system becomes turbid. As a result, benthic vegetation cannot receive light and decline, increasing nutrient availability and allowing [[phytoplankton]] to dominate. In this state shift scenario the state variables changing are the populations of benthic vegetation and phytoplankton, and the ecosystem parameters are turbidity and nutrient levels. So, whether identifying mechanisms of variables or parameters is a matter of formulation (Beisner et al. 2003).

== Hysteresis effects ==

[[Hysteresis]] is an important concept in alternative stable state theory. In this ecological context, hysteresis refers to the existence of different stable states under the same variables or parameters. Hysteresis can be explained by "path-dependency", in which the [[equilibrium point]] for the trajectory of "A → B" is different from for "B → A". In other words, it matters which way the ball is moving across the landscape. Some ecologists (e.g., Scheffer et al. 2001) argue that hysteresis is a prerequisite for the existence of alternative stable states. Others (e.g., Beisner et al. 2003) claim that this is not so; although shifts often involve hysteresis, a system can show alternative stable states yet have equal paths for "A → B" and "B → A".

Hysteresis can occur via changes to variables or parameters. When variables are changed the ball is pushed from one domain of attraction to another, yet the same push from the other direction cannot return the ball to the original domain of attraction. When parameters are changed a modification to the landscape results in a state shift, but reversing the modification does not result in a reciprocal shift.

A real-world example of hysteresis is helpful to illustrate the concept. [[Coral reef]] systems can dramatically shift from pristine coral-dominated systems to degraded [[algae]]-dominated systems when populations grazing on algae decline. The 1983 crash of [[sea urchin]] populations in [[Caribbean]] reef systems released algae from top-down ([[herbivory]]) control, allowing them to overgrow corals and resulting in a shift to a [[environmental degradation|degraded]] state. When urchins rebounded, the high (pre-crash) coral cover levels did not return, indicating hysteresis (Mumby et al. 2007).

In some cases, state shifts under hysteresis may be irreversible. For example, tropical [[cloud forest]]s require high moisture levels, provided by clouds that are intercepted by the canopy (via condensation). When [[deforested]], moisture delivery ceases. Therefore, reforestation is often unsuccessful because conditions are too dry to allow the trees to grow (Wilson and Agnew 1992). Even in cases where there is no obvious barrier to recovery, alternative states can be remarkably persistent: an experimental grassland heavily fertilized for 10 years lost much of its biodiversity, and was still in this state 20 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Isbell|first1=Forest|last2=Tilman|first2=David|last3=Polasky|first3=Stephen|last4=Binder|first4=Seth|last5=Hawthorne|first5=Peter|last6=Rejmanek|first6=Marcel|title=Low biodiversity state persists two decades after cessation of nutrient enrichment|journal=Ecology Letters|date=April 2013|volume=16|issue=4|pages=454–460|doi=10.1111/ele.12066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resilience ==

By their very nature, basins of attraction display [[ecological resilience|resilience]]. Ecosystems are resistant to state shifts – they will only undergo shifts under substantial perturbations – but some states are more resilient than others. In the ball-and-cup model, a valley with steep sides has greater resilience than a shallow valley, since it would take more force to push the ball up the hill and out of the valley.

Resilience can change in stable states when environmental parameters are shifted. Often, humans influence stable states by reducing the resilience of basins of attraction. There are at least three ways in which anthropogenic forces reduce resilience (Folke et al. 2004): (1) Decreasing diversity and [[functional group]]s, often by top-down effects (e.g., overfishing); (2) altering the physico-chemical environment (e.g., [[climate change]], [[pollution]], [[fertilizer|fertilization]]); or (3) modifying disturbance regimes to which organisms are adapted (e.g., [[bottom trawling]], [[coral mining]], etc.). When the resilience is decreased, ecosystems can be pushed into alternative, and often less-desirable, stable states with only minor perturbations. When hysteresis effects are present, the return to a more-desirable state is sometimes impossible or impractical (given management constraints). Shifts to less-desirable states often entail a loss of ecosystem service and function, and have been documented in an array of terrestrial, marine, and freshwater environments (reviewed in Folke et al. 2004).

== Evidence ==

Most work on alternative stable states has been theoretical, using [[mathematical model]]s and simulations to test ecological hypotheses. Other work has been conducted using empirical evidence from surveying, [[History|historical records]], or comparisons across [[spatial scale]]s. There has been a lack of direct, manipulative experimental tests for alternative stable states. This is especially true for studies outside of controlled laboratory conditions, where state shifts have been documented for cultures of [[microorganism]]s.

Verifying the existence of alternative stable states carries profound implications for [[ecosystem management]]. If stable states exist, gradual changes in [[environmental factor]]s may have little effect on a system until a threshold is reached, at which point a catastrophic state shift may occur. Understanding the nature of these thresholds will help inform the design of monitoring programs, ecosystem restoration, and other management decisions. Managers are particularly interested in the potential of hysteresis, since it may be difficult to recover from a state shift (Beisner et al. 2003). The mechanisms of [[Feedback|feedback loops]] that maintain stable states are important to understand if we hope to effectively manage an ecosystem with alternative stable states.

=== Empirical evidence ===

Empirical evidence for the existence of alternative stable states is vital to advancing the idea beyond theory. Schröder et al. (2005) reviewed the current ecological literature for alternative stable states and found 35 direct experiments, of which only 21 were deemed valid. Of these, 62% (14) showed evidence for and 38% (8) showed no evidence for alternative stable states. However, the Schröder et al. (2005) analysis required evidence of hysteresis, which is not necessarily a prerequisite for alternative stable states. Other authors (e.g., Scheffer et al. 2001; Folke et al. 2004) have had less-stringent requirements for the documentation of alternative stable states.

State shifts via the community perspective have been induced experimentally by the addition or removal of predators, such as in Paine's (1966) work on [[keystone predator]]s (i.e., predators with disproportionate influence on community structure) in the [[intertidal zone]] (although this claim is refuted by Schröder et al. 2005). Also, Beisner et al. (2003) suggest that commercially exploited fish populations can be forced between alternative stable states by [[fishing pressure]] due to [[Allee effect]] that work at very low population sizes. Once a fish population falls below a certain threshold, it will inevitably go extinct when low population densities make replacement of adults impossible due to, for example, the inability to find mates or density-dependent [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. Since populations cannot return from extinction, this is an example of an irreversible state shift.

Although alternative stable state theory is still in its infancy, empirical evidence has been collected from a variety of [[biome]]s:

* [[Sahara|The Sahara]] region, once vegetated, suddenly collapsed into a desert about 5,000 to [[4th millennium BC|6,000 years ago]] due to climate change (Scheffer and Carpenter 2003). Recent alteration of disturbance states via [[Fire fighting|fire suppression]] has caused state shifts in fire-adapted ecosystems of the [[southeastern United States]] (Peterson 2002).
* In the [[northeastern United States]] alternative stable states have been experimentally documented in [[Temperate hardwood forest|hardwood forest]] [[Food chain|food webs]] (Schmitz 2004). Spiders exhibit top-down control on generalist herbivore grasshoppers, causing them to hide in and forage on a competitively dominant plant species. Herbivory on the superior plant competitor reduces dominance, thereby increasing plant diversity. Under experimental removal of spiders, grasshoppers were released from predation and consumed plants without preference for the competitively-superior species. This top competitor outcompeted other species, resulting in lower overall plant diversity. Furthermore, reintroductions of spiders failed to return the system to high plant diversity, indicating ecological thresholds.
* Ponds, lakes, and other small [[Body of water|bodies of water]] are ideal for studying alternative stable states because they are relatively self-contained (Holling 1973). There has been great interest in state shifts in shallow temperate lakes between clear-water and turbid-water states. Nutrient loading can shift clear lakes to turbid systems by causing phytoplankton blooms (Scheffer 1997). Feedbacks maintaining the turbid state include shading out benthic macrophytes, which otherwise stabilize sediments and reduce rapid nutrient cycling. Hysteresis may occur if reductions in nutrient input do not return the clear-water state.
* Alternative stable states have also been shown for freshwater faunal communities. Initial conditions, such as densities of snails, can influence the movement of an ecosystem into one of several alternative stable equilibria (Chase 2003).
* Additionally, alternative stable states have been documented experimentally in coastal [[marine ecosystem]]s. Arctic [[salt marshes]] of [[Hudson Bay]], Manitoba have been shown to shift from a vegetated state to an unvegetated state due to overgrazing by [[snow goose|snow geese]] (Handa et al. 2002). When geese were experimentally removed, recovery of the system only occurred under ideal soil conditions, indicating hysteresis.

The '''American Gas Association''' ('''AGA'''), founded in 1918, is an American [[trade organization]] representing over 200&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/uncategorized/2453-new-american-gas-association-chair-sets-priorities-growing-natural-gas-industry/|title=New American Gas Association chair sets priorities for growing natural gas industry|last=|first=|date=2016-12-06|work=|newspaper=Daily Energy Insider|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-07|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[natural gas]] supply companies and others with an interest in the manufacturing of gas appliances as well as the production of gas. About 92% of the 70 million natural gas customers in the US receive their gas from AGA members.

The association contains two divisions, [[Business operations|operations]] and [[engineering]], and [[public relations|public affairs.]] These two divisions work together to handle [[finance]], corporate affairs, communications, and membership departments to deliver timely and relevant information to association members. The AGA also works with [[lawmaker]]s, regulatory bodies, environmental and [[consumer affairs]] organizations, and the public at large, informing them of the natural gas utility industry in the United States.

==History==
The American Gas Association formed in June 1918 after the merger of the American Gas Institute and the National Commercial Gas Association.  Those organizations served the interests of companies that dealt in manufactured, as opposed to natural, gas.  [[Coal gas|Manufactured gas]] was the dominant fuel in the early United States, but during the 19th century, natural gas supplanted it.

In January 1919, the AGA launched a publication for the natural gas industry providing information on trends, activities, and strategies on how to improve gas companies.

In 1925, the association formed laboratories in [[Cleveland]], and five years later expanded to Los Angeles. These labs developed technology to improve gas appliances and equipment, making them more energy efficient and consumer friendly.  The labs also did testing to ensure gas equipment conformed to national standards for safety, durability, and performance. The AGA ended its laboratory activities in 1997 and the new [[CSA International]] took its place.  CSA today still runs a U.S. certification-type program from the AGA's original Cleveland laboratory.

In 1927, the AGA merged with the National Gas Association to help the AGA's member companies which depended on manufactured gas to make a smooth transition to natural gas.

In 1935, Congress passed the [[Public Utility Act]] and broke up the [[holding company]] that dominated much of the country's utility industry; this law continued to be enforced until 2005.

During the 1930s, the AGA formed the National Advertising Committee to oversee a nationwide advertising program promoting gas for cooking, water heating, refrigeration, and house heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AGA Celebrates its 90th|last=Ryan|first=Karen|year=2008|publisher=Environment Complete|issn=1043-0652|pages=21–26| url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.www.consuls.org/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=007af59e-15ca-4a35-9584-409c00ab90a3%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the AGA installed a new chairman of the board, Pierce Norton.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Collective action==
"The American Gas Association has worked with the (FERC) [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] to improve [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] reporting. In 2004, the FERC issued a policy statement on price reporting and [[price index]] publishing.  The following year, the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] included market behavior and provisions and penalties, and FERC issued a rule prohibiting market manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Clear Buy|publisher=American Gas|last=Edmond|first=Jessica|year=2008|issn=1043-0652|pages=20–21|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.www.consuls.org/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5402f260-90e9-4c0e-90fd-fa4fbb67255f%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
According to Jay Copan, AGA's senior vice president of corporate affairs, AGA members deliver [[natural gas]] to 52 million homes, businesses and industrial facilities. Membership also features the unique profile of the millions of individuals who own stock in energy utilities. According to Copan, AGA's research shows that individuals, rather than institutions, own more than 50 percent of utility shares. 70 percent of utility [[stockholder]]s are the age of 65 and older, according to data provided by [[Edward Jones Investments|Edward Jones]] a leading brokerage firm, and by AGA member companies.&lt;ref name=kaffman&gt;{{cite news|title=No(Double)Taxation|last=Kaffmann|first=Bruce G|year=2003|publisher=American Gas|issn=1043-0652|pages=20, 3p| url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.www.consuls.org/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=ca9a5c19-108f-490e-827d-53a2b211040c%40sessionmgr110&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
The American Gas Association has faced financial issues regarding the taxation of [[dividend]]s. In 2002, The American Gas Association's main priority was to eliminate [[double taxation]] on dividends. AGA analyst Charlie Fritts voiced his opinions about the opposition of double taxation due to the possible effects it can have on gas companies. The United States tax code has also been seen as problematic by the American Gas Association, mostly because it creates an uneven playing field for companies that pay dividends and gas companies that maintain most of their earnings. Fritts had also viewed double taxation as problematic because the gas utility industry is expected to raise approximately $100 billion in capital in the following 20 years after 2002, which can be hampered if profits (dividends) from investments are highly taxed. The main goal was to develop a natural gas infrastructure in the United States.&lt;ref name=kaffman /&gt; Fritts also stated that "natural gas demand is expected to grow 50 percent between 2003 until 2020; utilities must raise substantial capital to build 255,000 miles of natural gas distribution pipe to meet that demand."&lt;ref name=kaffman /&gt;

The United States has enough domestic natural gas to meet demands for several industries for several decades into the future, according to the Potential Gas Committee (PGC). The committee is a nonprofit industry-funded organization. "Specifically, the United States possesses a technically recoverable natural gas resource base of 2,817 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) yet to be discovered, said Alexei V. Milkov, a professor and director of the PGC at the [[Colorado School of Mines]], which provides guidance and technical assistance to the PGC." Milkov Later clarified that "that’s jargon for 'the U.S. has abundant resources of natural gas.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/industry/6654-u-s-natural-gas-supply-hits-52-year-high-shale-accounting-64-pct-total-resources/|title=U.S. natural gas supply hits 52-year high with shale accounting for 64 pct of total resources|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2017-07-21|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-08-03|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current events==
In September 2011, Dave McCurdy the President and CEO of the American Gas Association has expressed optimism towards the growth of energy sources in the near future.   AGA's President argues how the United States current energy policy is divorced from the economic reality that natural gas has a good chance of competing in the marketplace if the United States is willing  to navigate away from dependence on foreign oil.  McCurdy has remained optimistic by speculating that consumer demand will increase during the next few years.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

McCurdy suggests that one of the main economic issues in the United States concerns its addiction to foreign oil.  The President of the American Gas Association has developed a few proposals to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming.  McCurdy mentions how the discovery of natural gas in the Marcellus State region  from upstate New York to Kentucky can transform into a future foundation site for American energy. The AGA President presented the idea that switching millions of tractor trailers  to natural gas would have played a substantial role not only in reducing the amount of foreign oil consumed by America but would ultimately reduce the production carbon emissions which contributes to global warming.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

McCurdy also argues drilling in some Marcellus states have had revitalized dying towns while keeping the unemployment rate below the national average.  McCurdy has been criticized for his proposal requiring the acquisition of natural gas because of the possibility of [[hydraulic fracturing]] leading to polluted water supplies.  Despite, the long-term issues of McCurdy's proposals, at the state level the short-term benefits are replaced by the realization that natural gas is not only an alternative solution to foreign oil but can also contribute to the creation of thousands of jobs.  The AGA President also explains methods on how to meet the Obama administration's goal of the development electric vehicles by 2025 by suggesting that the U.S. capital on natural gas and the development of infrastructure investments.While the American Gas Association believes that natural gas is considered a necessity in the United States they also believe that the fuel-economy requirements of the country cannot be meet without the production of natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Using natural gas the only good news story |last=Wolfgang |first=Ben |year=2011 |work=The Washington Times |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/sep/20/using-natural-gas-the-only-good-news-story/page=all }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amory Bloch Lovins''' (born November 13, 1947)&lt;ref name=who /&gt; is an American physicist, environmental scientist, writer, and Chairman/Chief Scientist of the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]]. He has worked in the field of [[energy policy]] and related areas for four decades. He was named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine one of the World's 100 most influential people in 2009.

Lovins worked professionally as an [[environmentalist]] in the 1970s and since then as an analyst of a "[[soft energy path]]" for the [[United States]] and other nations. He has promoted [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], the use of [[renewable energy]] sources, and the generation of energy at or near the site where the energy is actually used. Lovins has also advocated a "[[negawatt]] revolution" arguing that utility customers don't want [[kilowatt-hours]] of electricity; they want energy services. In the 1990s, his work with Rocky Mountain Institute included the design of an ultra-efficient automobile, the [[Hypercar (concept car)|Hypercar]].

Lovins does not see his energy ideas as green or left-wing, and he is an advocate of [[private enterprise]] and [[free market economics]]. He notes that [[Rupert Murdoch]] has made News Corporation [[carbon-neutral]], with savings of millions of dollars. But, says Lovins, large institutions are becoming more "gridlocked and moribund", and he supports the rise of "citizen organizations" around the world.

Lovins has received ten honorary doctorates and won many awards. He has provided expert testimony in eight countries, briefed 19 heads of state, and published 31 books. These books include ''[[Reinventing Fire]]'', ''[[Winning the Oil Endgame]]'', ''[[Small is Profitable]]'', ''[[Brittle Power]]'', and ''[[Natural Capitalism]]''.

== Early life ==
Born in [[Washington, DC]], Lovins spent much of his youth in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], and in [[Montclair, New Jersey]]. In 1964, Lovins entered [[Harvard College]]. After two years there, he transferred in 1967 to [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]],  where he studied physics and other subjects. In 1969 he became a Junior Research Fellow at [[Merton College, Oxford]], where he had a temporary [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)|Oxford master of arts]] status as a result of becoming a [[university don]]. He did not graduate, because the University would not allow him to pursue a doctorate in energy, as it was two years before the 1973 oil embargo and energy was not yet considered an academic subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2011/09/wonder-in-the-bewilderness |title=Wonder in the Bewilderness |author=Amory Lovins |date=Sep–Oct 2011 |work=Harvard Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovins resigned his Fellowship and moved to London to pursue his energy work. He moved back to the U.S. in 1981 and settled in western Colorado in 1982.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://rmi.org/Content/Files/Acorpbio_16i10.pdf Lovins Bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222141503/http://rmi.org/Content/Files/Acorpbio_16i10.pdf |date=2010-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Friends of the Earth===
Each summer from about 1965 to 1981, Lovins guided mountaineering trips and photographed the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of [[New Hampshire]], contributing photographs to ''At Home in the Wild: New England's White Mountains''.  In 1971 he wrote about the endangered [[Snowdonia National Park]] in the book, ''Eryri, the Mountains of Longing'', commissioned by [[David Brower]], president of [[Friends of the Earth]].&lt;ref name=profile&gt;[http://www.af-info.or.jp/eng/honor/hot/enr-lovins.html Profile of the 2007 Blue Planet Prize Recipient] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020005656/http://www.af-info.or.jp/eng/honor/hot/enr-lovins.html |date=October 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovins spent about a decade as British Representative for Friends of the Earth.

During the early seventies, Lovins became interested in the area of resource policy, especially [[energy policy]].  The [[1973 energy crisis]] helped create an audience for his writing and an essay originally penned as a U.N. paper grew into his first book concerned with energy, ''World Energy Strategies'' (1973).  His next book was ''[[Non-Nuclear Futures: The Case for an Ethical Energy Strategy]]'' (1975), co-authored with John H. Price. Lovins published a 10,000-word essay "Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken?" in ''Foreign Affairs'', in October 1976. Its contents were the subject of many seminars at government departments, universities, energy agencies, and nuclear energy research centers, during 1975–1977.&lt;ref&gt;Amory Lovins (1977). ''Soft Energy Paths'', p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The article was expanded and republished as ''Soft Energy Paths: Toward a Durable Peace'' in 1977.

===Rocky Mountain Institute===
By 1978 Lovins had published six books, consulted widely, and was active in energy affairs in some 15 countries.  In 1982, he and [[Hunter Lovins]] founded [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], based in [[Snowmass, Colorado]].  Together with a group of colleagues, the Lovinses fostered efficient resource use and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=profile /&gt;

Lovins has briefed 19 heads of state, provided expert testimony in eight countries, and published 29 books and several hundred papers.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;  His clients have included many [[Fortune 500]] companies, major real-estate developers, and utilities.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; Public-sector clients have included the [[OECD]], [[UN]], Resources for the Future, many national governments, and 13 US states.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; Lovins served in 1980–81 on the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Research Advisory Board, and in 1999–2001 and 2006–08 on Defense Science Board task forces on military energy efficiency and strategy. His visiting academic chairs most recently included a visiting professorship in Stanford University's School of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmi.org/stanford Stanford Energy Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117095814/http://www.rmi.org/stanford |date=2012-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1982, RMI has grown into a broad-based "think-and-do tank" with more than 85 staff and an annual budget of some $13 million.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; RMI has spun off five for-profit companies.&lt;ref&gt;Most recently www.esource.com, www.fiberforge.com, and www.brightautomotive.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==

===Soft energy paths===
[[File:Solar heater dsc00632.jpg|thumb|Solar energy technologies, such as [[solar water heater]]s, located on or near the buildings which they supply with energy, are a prime example of a soft energy technology.]]

Amory Lovins came to prominence in 1976 when he published an article in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' called "Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken?" Lovins argued that the United States had arrived at an important crossroads and could take one of two paths.&lt;ref name=joshua2011 /&gt; The first, supported by U.S. policy, promised a future of steadily increasing reliance on [[fossil fuel]]s and [[nuclear fission]], and had serious environmental risks. The alternative, which Lovins called "the soft path," favored "benign" sources of renewable energy like [[wind power]] and [[solar power]], along with a heightened commitment to energy conservation and energy efficiency. In October 1977, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' ran a cover story on Lovins' ideas.&lt;ref name=joshua2011&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/07/the-elusive-green-economy/7554/ |title=The Elusive Green Economy |author=Green, Joshua |date=July–August 2009 |work=The Atlantic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amory Lovins advocates "[[soft energy path]]s" involving [[efficient energy use]], diverse and [[renewable energy]] sources, and special reliance on "[[soft energy technologies]]". Soft energy technologies are those based on [[solar power|solar]], [[wind power|wind]], [[biofuel]]s, [[geothermal electricity|geothermal]], etc. which are matched in scale and quality to their task.  Residential solar energy technologies are prime examples of soft energy technologies and rapid deployment of simple, energy conserving, residential solar energy technologies is fundamental to a soft energy strategy.&lt;ref name=soft /&gt;

Lovins has described the "hard energy path" as involving inefficient energy use and centralized, non-renewable energy sources such as [[fossil fuels]]. He believes soft path impacts are more "gentle, pleasant and manageable" than hard path impacts.  These impacts range from the individual and household level to those affecting the very fabric of society at the national and international level.&lt;ref name=soft&gt;Amory Lovins (1977). ''Soft Energy Paths: Towards a Durable Peace'' {{ISBN|0-06-090653-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lovins on the Soft Path'' is an award-winning [[documentary film]] made by Amory and Hunter Lovins. It received many prizes: "Best Science and Technology Film, [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], 1983; Blue Ribbon, [[American Film Festival]], 1982; Best of the Festival, Environmental Education Film Festival, 1982; Best Energy Film, International Environmental Film Festival, 1982; and Chris Bronze Plaque, Columbus International Film Festival, 1982."&lt;ref&gt;''Lovins on the Soft Path: A Guide to the Film'', [[Rocky Mountain Institute|RMI]], 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear power limitations===
Lovins says that nuclear power plants are [[intermittent power source|intermittent]] in that they will sometimes fail unexpectedly, often for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=al2009&gt;{{cite web|first=Amory |last=Lovins |author2=Imran Sheikh |author3=Alex Markevich |date=2009 |url=http://www.rmi.org/rmi/Library/E09-01_NuclearPowerClimateFixOrFolly |title=Nuclear Power:Climate Fix or Folly |publisher=[[Rocky Mountain Institute]] |page=10 |quote=All sources of electricity sometimes fail, differing only in how predictably, why, how often, how much, and for how long. Even the most reliable giant power plants are intermittent: they fail un-expectedly in billion-watt chunks, often for long periods. |accessdate=20 Oct 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927101054/http://www.rmi.org/rmi/Library/E09-01_NuclearPowerClimateFixOrFolly |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the United States, 132 nuclear plants were built, and 21% were permanently and prematurely closed due to reliability or cost problems, while another 27% have at least once completely failed for a year or more. The remaining U.S. nuclear plants produce approximately 90% of their full-time full-load potential, but even they must shut down (on average) for 39 days every 17 months for scheduled refueling and maintenance.&lt;ref name=al2009 /&gt; To cope with such intermittence by nuclear (and centralized fossil-fuelled) power plants, utilities install a "reserve margin" of roughly 15% extra capacity spinning ready for instant use.&lt;ref name=al2009 /&gt;

Nuclear plants have an additional disadvantage; for safety, they must instantly shut down in a power failure, but for nuclear-physics reasons, they can't be restarted quickly. For example, during the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], nine operating U.S. nuclear units had to shut down and were later restarted.  During the first three days, while they were most needed, their output was less than 3% of normal.  After twelve days of restart, their average capacity loss had exceeded 50 percent.&lt;ref name=al2009 /&gt;

Lovins general assessment of nuclear power is that "Nuclear power is the only energy source where mishap or malice can kill so many people so far away; the only one whose ingredients can help make and hide nuclear bombs; the only climate solution that substitutes proliferation, accident, and high-level radioactive waste dangers. Indeed, nuclear plants are so slow and costly to build that they reduce and retard climate protection". With respect to the [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents]], Lovins has said: "An earthquake-and-tsunami zone crowded with 127 million people is an unwise place for 54 reactors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amory-lovins/nuclear-power-fukushima-_b_837643.html |title=With Nuclear Power, "No Acts of God Can Be Permitted" |author=Amory Lovins |date=March 18, 2011 |work=Huffington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the UK, Amory Lovins commented in 2014 that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Britain's plan for a fleet of new nuclear power stations is … unbelievable … It is economically daft. The guaranteed price [being offered to French state company EDF] is over seven times the unsubsidised price of new wind in the US, four or five times the unsubsidised price of new solar power in the US. Nuclear prices only go up. Renewable energy prices come down. There is absolutely no business case for nuclear. The British policy has nothing to do with economic or any other rational base for decision making.&lt;ref name="John Vidal"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/17/amory-lovins-renewable-energy |title= Amory Lovins: energy visionary sees renewables revolution in full swing |author=John Vidal |date=18 February 2014  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Negawatt revolution===
[[File:Energiesparlampe 01 retouched.jpg|thumb|A "negawatt revolution" would involve the rapid deployment of electricity-saving technologies, such as [[compact fluorescent lamps]].]]

A [[negawatt]] is a unit in watts of energy saved. It is basically the opposite of a [[watt]]. Amory Lovins has advocated a "negawatt revolution", arguing that utility customers don't want [[kilowatt-hours]] of electricity; they want energy services such as hot showers, cold beer, lit rooms, and spinning shafts, which can come more cheaply if electricity is used more efficiently.&lt;ref name=abl /&gt;

According to Lovins, [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] represents a profitable global market and American companies have at their disposal the technical innovations to lead the way. Not only should they "upgrade their plants and office buildings, but they should encourage the formation of negawatt markets".&lt;ref name=lov /&gt; Lovins sees negawatt markets as a win-win solution to many environmental problems. Because it is "now generally cheaper to save fuel than to burn it, global warming, acid rain, and urban smog can be reduced not at a cost but at a profit".&lt;ref name=lov&gt;Amory B. Lovins. [http://www.rmi.org/images/other/Energy/E90-20_NegawattRevolution.pdf The Negawatt Revolution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222042330/http://www.rmi.org/images/other/Energy/E90-20_NegawattRevolution.pdf |date=February 22, 2012 }} ''Across the Board'', Vol. XXVII No. 9, September 1990, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovins explains that many companies are already enjoying the financial and other rewards that come from saving electricity. Yet progress in converting to electricity saving technologies has been slowed by the indifference or outright opposition of some utilities.&lt;ref name=abl /&gt; A second obstacle to efficiency is that many electricity-using devices are purchased by people who won't be paying their running costs and thus have little incentive to consider efficiency.  Lovins also believes that many customers "don't know what the best efficiency buys are, where to get them, or how to shop for them".&lt;ref name=abl&gt;Amory B. Lovins. [http://www.rmi.org/images/other/Energy/E90-20_NegawattRevolution.pdf The Negawatt Revolution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222042330/http://www.rmi.org/images/other/Energy/E90-20_NegawattRevolution.pdf |date=February 22, 2012 }} ''Across the Board'', Vol. XXVII No. 9, September 1990, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypercar===
In 1994, Amory Lovins developed the design concept of the [[Hypercar (concept car)|Hypercar]].  This vehicle would have ultra-light construction with an [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] body using advanced [[composite material]]s, low-[[drag (physics)|drag]] design, and [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid drive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmi.org/images/PDFs/Transportation/T04-01_HypercarH2AutoTrans.pdf Hypercars, hydrogen, and the automotive transition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704183949/http://www.rmi.org/images/PDFs/Transportation/T04-01_HypercarH2AutoTrans.pdf |date=2013-07-04 }} ''International Journal of Vehicle Design'', Vol. 35, Nos. 1/2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Designers of the Hypercar claim that it would achieve a three- to fivefold improvement in [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], equal or better performance, safety, amenity, and affordability, compared with today's [[automobile|cars]].&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', [[UNSW Press]], pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, RMI took this process a step further by launching a for-profit venture, Hypercar Inc. This independent company, in which RMI has a minority interest, is now taking the lead in advancing key areas of Hypercar research and development.&lt;ref name=hyper&gt;[http://www.hypercar.com/ What is a Hypercar Vehicle?] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021129183918/http%3A//www.hypercar.com/ |date=2002-11-29 }} from Hypercar.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Hypercar Inc. changed its name to [[Fiberforge]] to better reflect the company's new goal of lowering the cost of high-volume advanced-composite structures by leveraging the patents of David F. Taggart, one of the founders of Hypercar, Inc.&lt;ref name=hyper /&gt;

Lovins says the commercialisation of the Hypercar began in 2014, with the production of the all-carbon electric [[BMW i3]] family and the 313 miles per gallon [[Volkswagen 1-litre car#2011 model|Volkswagen XL1]].&lt;ref name="John Vidal" /&gt;

===Citizen participation===
Lovins does not see his energy ideas as green or left-wing, and he is an advocate of [[private enterprise]] and [[free market economics]]. He notes that [[Rupert Murdoch]] has made News Corporation carbon-neutral, with savings of millions of dollars. But, says Lovins, large institutions are becoming more "gridlocked and moribund", and he supports the rise of "citizen organizations" around the world.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Paul Hawken]]'s ''[[Blessed Unrest]]'' chronicles the rise of millions of non-profit citizen organizations around the world — the greatest [[social movement]] in history. As central institutions become more gridlocked and moribund, a new vitality is beginning to spread renewal through the stem to the flower.&lt;ref&gt;Amory Lovins, ''[[Reinventing Fire: Bold Business Solutions for the New Energy Era]]'' (2011) p. 251 {{ISBN|978-1-60358-371-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
{{blp-refimprove|section|date=November 2018}}
Institutions and energy specialists have criticized various positions taken by Amory Lovins. One of the main points of contention is the assumption by the RMI of a linear relation between improvements in energy efficiency and reductions in aggregate energy consumption. The Jevons Paradox{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Jevons paradox]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} suggests that improvements in energy efficiency actually lead to an increase in energy use, as a result of decreasing cost. This "rebound effect" is downplayed in the analyses performed by Lovins.&lt;ref&gt;https://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/programs/energy-and-climate/reinventing-fire-and-the-dream-of-efficiency&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other assumptions made by Lovins have also received criticism. For example, in Lovins' book, Reinventing Fire, it is assumed that 50% of all electricity in the US could come from wind in 2050. Other authors find that this is capped probably around 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Lenzen, M., (2009), Current state of development of electricity-generating technologies – A literature review. Integrated Life Cycle Analysis, Dept. of Physics, University of Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar overestimated are identified in PV (solar), where estimates are made for about 30%; this is seen as implausible. Moreover, according to the authors, no analyses are given about the need for huge volumes of electricity storage, which would be needed when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. 
But these are always deliberate deceptions by those who don't want the fact know that the same powerlines dispatching/distributing electricity can shunt the same from interment areas it is being produced in surplus to those areas It isn't being produced in at any given time. For instance-Solar being shifted across time zones- primary East to West,and wind power from turbines in windy areas to those who have idle wind turbines at that time.
Thus does Distributed generation tend too win out,once minimum feeder areas are given surplus generation capacity-Particularly from diverse renewable  generating sources.
This was modelled in the case of Wind Power by Buckminister Fuller in the early 1970's. See:His intro to- Earth Energy and Everyone  M. Gabel editor.
Other essential loads that need to be "stored' can be dealt with inherently and passively such as heat(and cooling) loads by Passive Annual Heat Storage(see-J. Hait) or not so passively by distributed facilities over a large scale range. Not requiring massive capital expenditure and monstrous monopolies with public charter and subsidy. These also will Not be brought up by proliferationphile Perception Management Popes.

'''''Awful Splendour: A Fire History of Canada''''' is a 2007 non-fiction book by American environmental historian [[Stephen J. Pyne]]. It examines the natural, social and political history of [[forest fires]] in Canada.

==Background==
Author Pyne has a long relationship with forest fires; the [[Arizona State University]] professor was a wildland firefighter on the North Rim of the [[Grand Canyon]] for fifteen years, as well as a member of the [[United Nations]] Wildfire Advisory Group.&lt;ref name="BCStudies"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Huizen|first=Philip|date=Winter 2008–09|title=Awful Splendour: A Fire History of Canada by Stephen J. Pyne|url=http://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/bcstudies/article/view/571/615|journal=BC Studies|volume=160|issue=The Middle Fraser|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is part of a series on forest fires by Pyne.&lt;ref name=Canlit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brownstein |first=David |title=Book Review: Canadian Forests |journal=Canadian Literature |date=Summer 2009 |volume=#209 |url=http://canlit.ca/reviews/canadian_forests |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322053010/http://canlit.ca/reviews/canadian_forests |archivedate=2015-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''Circle of Fire'' series, he has covered forest fires in the U.S., Australia and on a global scale. The [[Canadian Forest Service]] encouraged Pyne to tackle the topic of Canadian forest fires. The phrase "awful splendour" was taken from a quote from early Canadian naturalist [[Henry Youle Hind]], referring to the destructive beauty of prairie fires.&lt;ref name=BCStudies /&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is divided into three sections, titled "Torch", "Axe", and "Engine", roughly corresponding to the pre-contact, exploration, and industrial periods of Canadian history.&lt;ref name=Canlit /&gt;  In its frequent mentions of American experiences with fire, the book engages in some [[comparative history]].&lt;ref name=Canlit /&gt;  Pyne defines several geographical "rings" of fire in Canada, including the boreal forests, the coastal forests of the Pacific and Atlantic, the mountain forests of British Columbia and Alberta, and the mixed wood forests of the Prairies, Ontario, and Quebec.&lt;ref name=Tyee&gt;{{cite news|last=Kilian|first=Crawford|title=Canada's Fires|url=https://thetyee.ca/Books/2009/06/10/CanadaFire/|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=The Tyee|date=10 Jun 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Canadian Literature'' noted that the book "filled a gaping hole" in Canadian scholarly writing on forest fires, and credited Pyne for accessing "[[grey literature]]" in hard to find locations. Reviewer David Brownstein called the book a "marvellously encyclopedic synthesis of a vast secondary literature on a complex topic."&lt;ref name=Canlit /&gt;  Reviewed in ''BC Studies'', Philip Van Huizen praised the "elegant and evocative" writing of the author, as well as his use of narrative. The reviewer critiqued some of Pyne's organisational choices; by looking at fire management province-by-province, the third section of the book has some redundancies and can be "a chore to read (at least in places)."  In all, Van Huizen called the work a "formidable and impressive book".&lt;ref name=BCStudies /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8636">Baseflow is the portion of the [[streamflow]] that is sustained between precipitation events, fed to streams by delayed pathways. '''Baseflow''' (also called '''drought flow''', '''groundwater recession flow''', '''low flow''', '''low-water flow''', '''low-water discharge''' and '''sustained''' or '''fair-weather runoff''') is the portion of [[streamflow]] delayed shallow subsurface flow". It should not be confused with [[groundwater flow]]. Fair weather flow is called as Base flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kendall and McDonnell

|publisher= Elsevier 
|accessdate= July 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==
Baseflow is important for sustaining human [[Center of population|centers of population]] and [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Katie|date=2011|title=Effects of watershed topography, soils, land use, and climate on baseflow hydrology in humid regions: A review|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0309133311402714|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|volume=35|pages=465–492|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true for [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] that do not rely on [[snowmelt]].  Different ecological processes will occur at different parts of the [[hydrograph]]. During the baseflow ascending limb there is frequently more [[stream]] area and [[habitat]] available for water dependent species, spawning [[salmon]] for example. During the recession limb which in California is from May to October there is increasingly less stream area, [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] species are more adapt at surviving in low flow conditions than [[introduced species]].

== Geology ==
Baseflow is derived from [[bedrock]] [[water storage]] near surface [[valley]] [[soil]]s and [[riparian zone]]s. Water [[Percolation|percolates]] to [[groundwater]] and then flows to a [[body of water]]&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; Baseflow depletion curve is the declining of baseflow/groundwater and soil reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Hydrology, Second Edition|last=Ward, Andy and Trimble, Stanley|first=|publisher=CRC Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1-4200-5661-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume and rate of water moving as baseflow can be affected by [[macropore]]s, [[micropores]], and other fractured conditions in the soil and shallow [[Geomorphology|geomorphic]] features. Infiltration to recharge subsurface storage increases baseflow. Evapotranspiration reduces baseflow because trees absorb water from the ground. In the fall baseflow can increase before it starts to rain because the trees drop their leaves and stop drinking as much water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868029499|title=Key concepts in geomorphology|last=R.,|first=Bierman, Paul|others=Montgomery, David R., 1961-, University of Vermont., University of Washington.|isbn=9781429238601|location=New York, NY|oclc=868029499}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[River incision]] can decrease the baseflow by lowering the [[water table]] and [[aquifer]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42330977|title=California rivers and streams : the conflict between fluvial process and land use|last=1954-|first=Mount, Jeffrey F.,|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520916937|location=Berkeley|oclc=42330977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good baseflow is connected to surface water that is located in permeable, soluble, or highly fractured bedrock. Bad baseflow is in [[crystal]]line or massive bedrock with minor fracturing and doesn’t store water.  Losing reaches is when the water flow decreases as it travels downstream and is  fracturing deeper than surface water or in karst geology because limestone and dolomite high storage. Gaining reaches is when flow increases as it travels downstream. Gaining reaches are common in humid mountainous regions where the water table is above the surface water and the water flows from high head to low head following [[Darcy's law|Darcy’s Law]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Measuring Baseflow ==
Methods for identifying baseflow sources and residence/transit time include using [[Solution|solutes]] and [[Flow tracer|tracer]]s. Solutes that originate in distinct areas of the watershed can be used to source baseflow-geochemical signatures. Tracers may be inserted into different parts of the watershed to identify flow paths and transit times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glynn|first=Pierre D.|last2=Plummer|first2=L. Niel|date=2005-03-01|title=Geochemistry and the understanding of ground-water systems|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10040-004-0429-y|journal=Hydrogeology Journal|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=263–287|doi=10.1007/s10040-004-0429-y|issn=1431-2174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods for summarizing baseflow from an existing streamflow record include event based low flow statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Keeffe|first=Jay|date=2009|title=Sustaining river ecosystems: balancing use and protection|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0309133309342645|journal=Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment|volume=33|pages=339–357|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; flow duration curve,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Hydrology|last=Stedinger, JR, Vogel, RM, and Foufoula-Georgiou, E|first=|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; metrics that explain proportioning of baseflow to total flow,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-06-30|title=Examining geological controls on baseflow index (BFI) using regression analysis: An illustration from the Thames Basin, UK|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169409002522|journal=Journal of Hydrology|language=en|volume=373|issue=1-2|pages=164–176|doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.04.025|issn=0022-1694}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the baseflow recession curve which can be used on ungauged streams based on empirical relationship between watershed characteristics and baseflow at gauged sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Posavec|first=Kristijan|last2=Bacani|first2=Andrea|last3=Nakic|first3=Zoran|date=2006-05-26|title=A Visual Basic Spreadsheet Macro for Recession Curve Analysis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2006.00226.x|journal=Ground Water|language=en|volume=0|issue=0|pages=060526082055001–???|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6584.2006.00226.x|issn=0017-467X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain parameters of baseflow, such as the [[Mean baseflow residence time|mean residence time]] and the baseflow recession curve, can be useful in describing the mixing of waters (such as from precipitation and groundwater) and the level of groundwater contribution to streamflow in catchments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vitvar|display-authors=etal|year=2002|title=Estimation of baseflow residence times in watersheds from the runoff hydrograph recession: method and application in the Neversink watershed, Catskill Mountains, New York|url=http://www.cof.orst.edu/cof/fe/watershd/pdf/2002/Vitvar_et_al_2002.pdf|journal=Hydrol. Processes|volume=16|pages=1871–1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseflow separation is often used to determine what portion of a streamflow [[hydrograph]] occurs from baseflow, and what portion occurs from [[overland flow]]. Common methods include using [[Isotope hydrology|isotope tracing]] and the software program [https://water.usgs.gov/software/HYSEP/ HYSEP], among others.

== Anthropogenic effects ==
[[Human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] effects to baseflow include [[forestry]], [[urbanization]], and [[agriculture]]. Forest cover has high infiltration and recharge because of tree roots. Removal of forest cover can have short term increase in mean flow and baseflow because less interception and [[evapotranspiration]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Urbanization includes a re-organization of surface and subsurface pathways so that water is flushed through catchments because of reduced hydraulic resistance, [[Manning's n|Manning’s n]], channels and impervious surfaces which decreases infiltration. In urban areas water is often imported from outside the watershed from deep wells and [[reservoir]]s. The pipes that transport the water often leak 20-25% to the subsurface which can actually increase baseflow. Agriculture c≈an lower baseflow if water diverted from stream for irrigation, or can raise baseflow if water is used from a different watershed.  Pastures can increase compaction and reduce organic matter with reduces infiltration and baseflow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another type of cryoseism is a [[Plate tectonics|non-tectonic]] [[seismology|seismic event]] caused by sudden [[glacial motion|glacial movements]]. This movement has been attributed to a [[wiktionary:veneer|veneer]] of water which may pool underneath a [[glacier]] sourced from surface ice melt.

The requirements for a cryoseism to occur are numerous;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fqclimate"/&gt; therefore, accurate predictions are not entirely possible and may constitute a factor in [[structural design]] and [[engineering]] when constructing in an area historically known for such events.&lt;ref name="shortnote"/&gt; Speculation has been made between [[global warming]] and the frequency of cryoseisms.&lt;ref name="fqclimate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pdf"/&gt;

== Effects ==
Cryoseisms are often mistaken for minor [[intraplate earthquake|intraplate]] [[earthquake]]s.&lt;ref name="shortnote"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VGS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anr.state.vt.us/dec/geo/EBEL.htm|title=A Report on the Seismic Vulnerability of the State of Vermont|accessdate=2006-10-22|author1=John E. Ebel |author2=Richard Bedell |author3=Alfredo Urzua |date=July 1995|work=Geology of Mineral Resources|publisher=[[Vermont]] Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial indications may appear similar to those of an earthquake with [[tremor]]s, vibrations, ground cracking and related noises,&lt;ref name="MGS"/&gt; such as thundering or booming sounds.&lt;ref name="wnb"/&gt; Cryoseisms can, however, be distinguished from earthquakes through [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[geology|geological]] conditions.&lt;ref name="shortnote"/&gt; Cryoseisms can have an intensity of up to VI on the [[Mercalli intensity scale|Modified Mercalli Scale]].&lt;ref name="shortnote"/&gt; Furthermore, cryoseisms often exhibit high intensity in a very localized area,&lt;ref name="MGS"/&gt; in the immediate proximity of the [[epicenter]],&lt;ref name="VGS"/&gt; as compared to the widespread effects of an earthquake.&lt;ref name="shortnote"/&gt; Due to lower-[[frequency]] vibrations of cryoseisms,&lt;ref name="moment"/&gt; some seismic monitoring stations may not record their occurrence.&lt;ref name="VGS"/&gt; Although cryoseisms release less [[energy]] than most tectonic events,&lt;ref name="erebus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ees.nmt.edu/Geop/mevo/seismic/icequakes.html |title=Erebus Icequakes |accessdate=2006-11-16 |publisher=[[Mount Erebus]] Volcano Observatory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831112521/http://www.ees.nmt.edu/Geop/mevo/seismic/icequakes.html |archivedate=2006-08-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; they can still cause damage or significant changes to an affected area.&lt;ref name="MGS"/&gt;

Some reports have indicated the presence of "distant flashing lights" before or during a cryoseism, possibly because of [[electricity|electrical]] changes when rocks are compressed.&lt;ref name="wnb"/&gt; Cracks and [[fissure]]s may also appear as surface areas contract and split apart from the cold.&lt;ref name="MGS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VGS"/&gt; The sometime superficial to moderate occurrences may range from a few centimeters to several kilometers long, with either singular or multiple linear fracturing and vertical or lateral [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] possible.&lt;ref name="shortnote"/&gt;

=== Precursors ===
There are four main precursors for a frost quake cryoseism event to occur:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fqclimate"/&gt; (1) a region must be susceptible to cold air masses, (2) the ground must undergo saturation from thaw or liquid precipitation prior to an intruding cold air mass, (3) most frost quakes are associated with minor snow cover on the ground without a significant amount of snow to insulate the ground (i.e., less than 6 inches), and (4) a rapid temperature drop from approximately freezing to near or below zero degrees Fahrenheit, which ordinarily occurred on a timescale of 16 to 48 hours.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cryoseisms typically occur when temperatures rapidly decrease from above freezing to [[Temperature|subzero]],&lt;ref name="MGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VGS" /&gt; and are more than likely  to occur between midnight and dawn (during the coldest parts of night).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shortnote" /&gt; [However, due to the permanent nature of glacial ice, glacier-related cryoseisms may also occur in the warmer months of summer.]&lt;ref name="moment" /&gt; In general, cryoseisms may occur 3 to 4 hours after significant changes in [[temperature]].&lt;ref name="precursor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/Geosciences/qketour/frostqke/willis2.html|title=Icequake Precursors|author1=D.E. Willis |author2=R.W. Taylor |author3=M. LeNoble |author4=S. Yellin |date=October 1979|work=51st Annual Meeting of the Eastern Section of the Seismological Society of America|publisher=Dept of Geological Sciences, [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]|accessdate=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perennial or seasonal [[frost]] conditions involved with cryoseisms limit these events to [[temperate]] climates that experience seasonal variation with subzero winters. Additionally, the ground must be saturated with water, which can be caused by snowmelt, rain, sleet or flooding.&lt;ref name="shortnote" /&gt;  Geologically, areas of [[permeability (fluid)|permeable]] materials like [[sand]] or [[gravel]], which are susceptible to frost action, are likelier candidates for cryoseisms.&lt;ref name="shortnote" /&gt; Following large cryoseisms, little to no seismic activity will be detected for several hours, indicating that accumulated stress has been relieved.&lt;ref name="precursor" /&gt;

'''Debris flows''' are geological phenomena in which water-laden masses of [[soil]] and fragmented [[Rock (geology)|rock]] rush down mountainsides, funnel into [[stream]] channels, entrain objects in their paths, and form thick, muddy deposits on valley floors. They generally have [[bulk density|bulk densities]] comparable to those of [[rock avalanche]]s and other types of [[landslide classification|landslides]] (roughly 2000 kilograms per cubic meter), but owing to widespread sediment [[liquefaction]] caused by high [[pore pressure|pore-fluid pressures]], they can flow almost as fluidly as water.&lt;ref name="geo.mtu.edu"&gt;[https://profile.usgs.gov/myscience/upload_folder/ci2013Mar07174849246641997.Iverson.PhysicsDebrisFlows.Rev.Geophys.pdf Iverson, R.M., 1997, The physics of debris flows, Reviews of Geophysics, 35(3): 245–296.]&lt;/ref&gt; Debris flows descending steep channels commonly attain speeds that surpass 10 m/s (36 km/h), although some large flows can reach speeds that are much greater. Debris flows with volumes ranging up to about 100,000 cubic meters occur frequently in mountainous regions worldwide. The largest prehistoric flows have had volumes exceeding 1 billion cubic meters (i.e., 1 cubic kilometer). As a result of their high sediment concentrations and mobility, debris flows can be very destructive.

Notable debris-flow disasters of the twentieth century involved more than 20,000 fatalities in [[Armero tragedy|Armero]], [[Colombia]] in 1985 and tens of thousands in [[Vargas tragedy|Vargas State]], [[Venezuela]] in 1999.

==Features and behavior==
Debris flows have volumetric [[sediment]] concentrations exceeding about 40 to 50%, and the remainder of a flow's volume consists of water.  By definition, “debris” includes sediment grains with diverse shapes and sizes, commonly ranging from microscopic [[Clay#Definition|clay]] particles to great [[boulder]]s. Media reports often use the term [[mudflow]] to describe debris flows, but true mudflows are composed mostly of grains smaller than [[sand]].  On Earth's land surface, mudflows are far less common than debris flows. However, underwater mudflows are prevalent on submarine [[continental margin]]s, where they may spawn [[turbidity current]]s. Debris flows in forested regions can contain large quantities of [[Large woody debris|woody debris]] such as logs and tree stumps. Sediment-rich water floods with solid concentrations ranging from about 10 to 40% behave somewhat differently from debris flows and are known as [[Hyperconcentrated flow|hyperconcentrated]] floods.&lt;ref name="USGSguide"&gt;Pierson, Thomas C. [http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/infobank/programs/html/factsheets/pdfs/2004_3142.pdf Distinguishing between debris flows and floods from field evidence in small watersheds]. US Department of the Interior, US Geological Survey, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Normal stream flows contain even lower concentrations of sediment.

Debris flows can be triggered by intense rainfall or snowmelt, by dam-break or glacial outburst floods, or by landsliding that may or may not be associated with intense rain.  In all cases the chief conditions required for debris flow initiation include the presence of slopes steeper than about 25 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, the availability of abundant loose sediment, soil, or weathered rock, and sufficient water to bring this loose material to a state of almost complete [[saturation (chemistry)|saturation]]. Debris flows can be more frequent following forest and brush fires, as experience in southern California demonstrates. They pose a significant hazard in many steep, mountainous areas, and have received particular attention in Japan, China, Taiwan, USA, Canada, New Zealand, the Philippines, the European Alps, Russia, and Kazakhstan.  In Japan a large debris flow or [[landslide]] is called [[:wikt:yamatsunami|''yamatsunami'']] ([[:ja:山津波|山津波]]), literally ''mountain [[tsunami]]''.

[[File:DebrisFlowDepositRestingSpringsPass.JPG|thumb|Ancient debris flow deposit, Resting Springs Pass, California.]]
Debris flows are accelerated downhill by gravity and tend to follow steep mountain channels that debouche onto [[alluvial fan]]s or [[floodplain]]s.  The front, or 'head' of a debris-flow surge often contains an abundance of coarse material such as boulders and logs that impart a great deal of [[friction]]. Trailing behind the high-friction flow head is a lower-friction, mostly liquefied flow body that contains a higher percentage of [[sand]], [[silt]] and clay. These fine sediments help retain high pore-fluid pressures that enhance debris-flow mobility. In some cases the flow body is followed by a more watery tail that transitions into a hyperconcentrated stream flow.  Debris flows tend to move in a series of pulses, or discrete surges, wherein each pulse or surge has a distinctive head, body and tail.  [[File:Debris flow deposit, Ladakh, NW Indian Himalaya (2).JPG|thumb|Another debris flow in Ladakh, triggered by storms in 2010. Note poor sorting and levees. Steep source catchment is visible in background.]]

Debris-flow deposits are readily recognizable in the field.  They make up significant percentages of many alluvial fans and [[debris cone]]s along steep mountain fronts.  Fully exposed deposits commonly have lobate forms with boulder-rich snouts, and the lateral margins of debris-flow deposits and paths are commonly marked by the presence of boulder-rich lateral [[levees]].  These natural levees form when relatively mobile, liquefied, fine-grained debris in the body of debris flows shoulders aside coarse, high-friction debris that collects in debris-flow heads as a consequence of grain-size segregation (a familiar phenomenon in [[granular material|granular mechanics]]). Lateral levees can confine the paths of ensuing debris flows, and the presence of older levees provides some idea of the magnitudes of previous debris flows in a particular area.  Through dating of trees growing on such deposits, the approximate frequency of destructive debris flows can be estimated. This is important information for land development in areas where debris flows are common. Ancient debris-flow deposits that are exposed only in [[outcrop]]s are more difficult to recognize, but are commonly typified by juxtaposition of grains with greatly differing shapes and sizes. This poor [[sorting (sediment)|sorting]] of sediment grains distinguishes debris-flow deposits from most water-laid sediments.

==Types==

Other [[geology|geological]] flows that can be described as debris flows are typically given more specific names. These include:

===Lahar===
{{main article|lahar}}
A [[lahar]] is a debris flow related in some way to [[volcanic activity]], either directly as a result of an eruption, or indirectly by the collapse of loose material on the flanks of a volcano.  A variety of phenomena may trigger a lahar, including melting of glacial ice, intense rainfall on loose [[pyroclastic]] material, or the outburst of a lake that was previously dammed by pyroclastic or glacial sediments.  The word lahar is of Indonesian origin, but is now routinely used by geologists worldwide to describe volcanogenic debris flows.  Nearly all of Earth's largest, most destructive debris flows are lahars that originate on volcanoes. An example is the lahar that inundated the city of [[Armero tragedy|Armero]], Colombia.

===Jökulhlaup===
{{main article|Jökulhlaup}}
A [[jökulhlaup]] is a glacial outburst flood. Jökulhlaup is an Icelandic word, and in Iceland many glacial outburst floods are triggered by sub-glacial volcanic eruptions.  (Iceland sits atop the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is formed by a chain of mostly submarine volcanoes).  Elsewhere, a more common cause of jökulhlaups is the breaching of ice-dammed or [[moraine]]-dammed lakes.  Such breaching events are often caused by the sudden calving of glacier ice into a lake, which then causes a displacement wave to breach a moraine or ice dam. Downvalley of the breach point, a jökulhlaup may increase greatly in size through [[Entrainment (physical geography)|entrainment]] of loose sediment from the valley through which it travels. Ample entrainment can enable the flood to transform to a debris flow. Travel distances may exceed 100&amp;nbsp;km.

==Theories and models of debris flows==
Numerous different approaches have been used to model debris-flow properties, [[kinematics]], and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]].  Some are listed here.

*Rheologically based models that apply to mud flows treat debris flows as single-phase homogeneous materials (Examples include: [[Bingham fluid|Bingham]], [[viscoplastic]], Bagnold-type [[Power-law fluid#Dilatant fluids|dilatant fluid]], [[thixotropic]], etc.)

===Two-phase===
The [[mixture theory]], originally proposed by Iverson&lt;ref name="geo.mtu.edu"/&gt; and later adopted and modified by others, treats debris flows as two-phase solid-fluid mixtures.

In real two-phase (debris) mass flows there exists a strong coupling between the [[solid]] and the [[fluid]] [[momentum transfer]], where the solid's normal [[stress (physics)|stress]] is reduced by [[buoyancy]], which in turn diminishes the [[friction]]al resistance, enhances the [[pressure gradient]], and reduces the [[drag (physics)|drag]] on the solid component. Buoyancy is an important aspect of two-phase debris flow, because it enhances flow mobility (longer travel distances) by reducing the frictional resistance in the [[mixture]]. Buoyancy is present as long as there is fluid in the mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=E. B., Pitman  |author2=L. Le |title= A two-fluid model for avalanche and debris flows |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A |volume= 363 |year =2005|pages =1573–1602 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2005.1596|bibcode=2005RSPTA.363.1573P}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reduces the solid normal stress, solid lateral normal stresses, and the basal [[shear stress]] (thus, frictional resistance) by a factor (&lt;math&gt; 1-\gamma &lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt; is the density [[ratio]] between the fluid and the solid phases. The effect is substantial when the density ratio (&lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt;) is large (e.g., in the natural debris flow).

If the flow is neutrally buoyant, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 1&lt;/math&gt;, (see, e.g., Bagnold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= R. A. Bagnold |title=  Experiments on a gravity-free dispersion of large solid spheres in a Newtonian fluid under shear  |journal= [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=  225| year = 1954|pages = 49–63 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1954.0186|bibcode=1954RSPSA.225...49B}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1954) the debris mass is fluidized and moves longer travel distances. This can happen in highly [[viscosity|viscous]] natural debris flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=B. W., McArdell |author2=P. Bartelt, J. Kowalski  |last-author-amp=yes |title= Field observations of basal forces and fluid pore pressure in a debris flow |journal= Geophys. Res. Lett. |volume=  34 |year =2007 |doi=10.1029/2006GL029183 |bibcode=2007GeoRL..34.7406M}}&lt;/ref&gt; For neutrally buoyant flows, [[Coulomb friction]] disappears, the lateral solid pressure gradient vanishes, the [[drag coefficient]] is zero, and the basal slope effect on the solid phase also vanishes. In this [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]], the only remaining solid force is due to [[gravity]], and thus the force associated with buoyancy.
Under these conditions of [[hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] support of the [[particle]]s by the fluid, the debris mass is fully fluidized (or [[lubrication|lubricated]]) and moves very economically, promoting long travel distances. Compared to buoyant flow, the neutrally buoyant flow shows completely different behaviour. For the latter case, the solid and fluid phases move together, the debris bulk mass is fluidized, the front moves substantially farther, the tail lags behind, and the overall flow height is also reduced. When &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the flow does not experience any buoyancy effect. Then the effective frictional shear stress for the solid phase is that of pure [[granular]] flow. In this case the force due to the pressure gradient is altered, the drag is high and the effect of the virtual mass disappears in the solid momentum. All this leads to slowing down the [[Motion (physics)|motion]].

==Damage prevention==

In order to prevent debris flows reaching property and people, a debris basin may be constructed. Debris basins are designed to protect soil and water resources or to prevent downstream damage. Such constructions are considered to be a last resort because they are expensive to construct and require commitment to annual maintenance.&lt;ref name="fws"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fws.gov/fire/ifcc/esr/Treatments/debris-basin.htm |title=Debris Basins |publisher=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desizing''' is the process of removing the [[Textile sizing|size]] material from [[warp (weaving)|warp]] [[yarn]]s after a [[textile]] fabric is [[weaving|woven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Desize |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/desize |website=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sizing agents==
Sizing agents are selected on the basis of type of fabric, environmental friendliness, ease of removal, cost considerations, [[effluent]] treatment, etc.

===Natural sizing agents===
Natural sizing agents are based on natural substances and their derivatives:

* [[Starch]] and [[modified starch|starch derivatives]]: native starch, degradation starch, chemically [[modified starch]] products
* [[cellulose|Cellulosic]] derivatives: [[carboxymethylcellulose]] (CMC), [[methylcellulose]], [[oxyethylcellulose]]
* [[Protein]]-based starches: [[glue]], [[gelatin]], [[albumen]]

===Synthetic sizing agents===
* [[Polyacrylate]]s
* Modified [[polyester]]s
* [[Polyvinyl alcohol]]s (PVA)
* [[Styrene]]/[[maleic acid]] [[copolymer]]s

==Desizing processes==
Desizing, irrespective of what the desizing agent is, involves impregnation of the fabric with the desizing agent, allowing the desizing agent to degrade or solubilise the size material, and finally to wash out the degradation products. The major desizing processes are:

* Enzymatic desizing of starches on cotton fabrics
* Oxidative desizing
* Acid desizing
* Removal of water-soluble sizes
* Fermentative desizing

===Enzymatic desizing===
Enzymatic desizing is the classical desizing process of degrading starch size on cotton fabrics using enzymes. [[Enzyme]]s are complex organic, soluble bio-catalysts, formed by living organisms, that catalyze chemical reaction in biological processes. Enzymes are quite specific in their action on a particular substance. A small quantity of enzyme is able to decompose a large quantity of the substance it acts upon. Enzymes are usually named by the kind of substance degraded in the reaction it catalyzes.

[[Amylase]]s are the enzymes that [[hydrolysis|hydrolyses]] and reduce the molecular weight of [[amylose]] and [[amylopectin]] molecules in starch, rendering it water-soluble enough to be washed off the fabric.

Effective enzymatic desizing require strict control of [[pH]], [[temperature]], [[water hardness]], [[electrolyte]] addition and choice of [[surfactant]].

===Oxidative desizing===
In oxidative desizing, the risk of damage to the cellulose fiber is very high, and its use for desizing is increasingly rare. Oxidative desizing uses potassium or [[sodium persulfate]] or [[sodium bromite]] as an [[oxidizing]] agent.

===Acid desizing===
Cold solutions of dilute [[sulfuric acid|sulphuric]] or [[hydrochloric acid]]s are used to hydrolyze the starch, however, this has the disadvantage of also affecting the cellulose fiber in [[cotton]] fabrics.

===Removal of water-soluble sizes===
Fabrics containing water-soluble sizes can be desized by washing using hot water, perhaps containing wetting agents (surfactants) and a mild alkali. The water replaces the size on the outer surface of the fiber, and absorbs within the fiber to remove any fabric residue.

===Fermentative desizing===
Fermentative desizing is defined as a fermentation process and involves the Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) microorganisms that have a high potential to produce enzymes; it is carried out via impregnation/padding methods, which provide online monitoring and accurate control. The method allows an economical process with low resource consumption and emission compared to the enzymatic method, it is considerably cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chand|first1=Nima|title=Fermentative desizing of cotton fabric using an α-amylase-producing Bacillus strain: optimization of simultaneous enzyme production and desizing|journal=Process  Biochemistry|volume=49|doi=10.1016/j.procbio.2014.07.007|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359511314003936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desizing 2000===
Desizing 2000 is a reliable and simple combined process of desizing and demineralization for cotton. Desizing 2000 is a novel desizing technique.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5196">'''ECHAM''' is a [[general circulation model]] (GCM) developed by the [[Max Planck Institute for Meteorology]], one of the research organisations of the [[Max Planck Society]]. It was created by modifying global forecast models developed by [[ECMWF]] to be used for climate research. The model was given its name as a combination of its origin (the 'EC' being short for '[[ECMWF]]') and the place of development of its parameterisation package, [[Hamburg]]. The default configuration of the model resolves the atmosphere up to 10 hPa (primarily used to study the lower atmosphere), but it can be reconfigured to 0.01 hPa for use in studying the [[stratosphere]] and lower [[mesosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MPI: ECHAM Page|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Meteorology|url=http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/wissenschaft/modelle/echam/|accessdate=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different versions of ECHAM, primarily different configurations of ECHAM5, have been the basis of many publications, listed on the ECHAM5 website [http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/wissenschaft/modelle/echam/echam5/reviewed.html].

==ECHAM5==
Compared to its predecessor, ECHAM4, it is more portable and flexible (it is now written in the programming language [[Fortran 95]]), and because of both major and minor changes to the different parts of code that it uses, it produces a significantly different simulated climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM 5.

MPI-ECHAM5 was recently used in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]], alongside many other GCMs from different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC-DDC: SRES-AR4 GCM data|author=IPCC Data Distribution Centre|url=http://www.mad.zmaw.de/IPCC_DDC/html/SRES_AR4/index.html|accessdate=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the data of this report, it is referred to with the abbreviation MPEH5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modelle &amp; Daten model abbreviations |author=Max Planck Institute for Meteorology|url=http://www.mad.zmaw.de/projects-at-md/ipcc-data/order-data-on-dvd/information/models/|accessdate=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears to be one of the more accurate [[General Circulation Model|GCMs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Antarctic assessment of IPCC AR4 coupled models|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306102758/http://scienceblogs.com/stoat/connolley_bracegirdle_07_AR4_Ant_assess.pdf|archive-date=2012-03-06|access-date=2017-01-13|dead-url=yes|url=http://scienceblogs.com/stoat/connolley_bracegirdle_07_AR4_Ant_assess.pdf|doi=10.1029/2007GL031648|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=34|last1=Connolley|first1=William M.|pages=L22505|authorlink1=William Connolley|last2=Bracegirdle|first2=Thomas J.|date=29 November 2007|format=PDF|bibcode=2007GeoRL..3422505C|issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ECHAM6==
ECHAM6 is currently the most advanced version of the ECHAM models. ECHAM6 is an atmospheric general circulation model, and as such focuses on the coupling between diabatic processes and large-scale circulations, both of which are ultimately driven by radiative forcing. It consists of a dry spectral-transform dynamical core, a transport model for scalar quantities other than temperature and surface pressure, a suite of physical parameterizations for the representation of diabatic processes, as well as boundary data sets for externalized parameters, such as trace gas and [[aerosol]] distributions, tabulations of gas absorption optical properties, temporal variations in spectral solar irradiance, land-surface properties, etc.

The major changes relative to ECHAM5 include: An improved representation of radiative transfer in the shortwave (or solar) part of the spectrum; a completely new description of aerosols; an improved representation of surface albedo, including the treatment of melt-ponds on [[sea ice]]; and a greatly improved representation of the middle-atmosphere as part of the standard model. In addition, minor changes have been made in the representation of convective processes, and through the choice of a slightly different vertical discretization within the troposphere, as well as changed model parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Atmospheric component of the MPI-M Earth System Model: ECHAM6|url = http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/fileadmin/models/MPIESM/pdfs/StevensEtAl2012.pdf|journal = Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems|date = 2013-06-01|issn = 1942-2466|pages = 146-172|volume = 5|issue = 2|doi = 10.1002/jame.20015|language = en|first = Bjorn|last = Stevens|first2 = Marco|last2 = Giorgetta|first3 = Monika|last3 = Esch|first4 = Thorsten|last4 = Mauritsen|first5 = Traute|last5 = Crueger|first6 = Sebastian|last6 = Rast|first7 = Marc|last7 = Salzmann|first8 = Hauke|last8 = Schmidt|first9 = Jürgen|last9 = Bader|accessdate=August 2015|bibcode = 2013JAMES...5..146S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2003, the '''Energy and Environmental Security Initiative (EESI)''' is an interdisciplinary [[Think Tank|Research &amp; Policy Institute]] located at the [[University of Colorado School of Law|University of Colorado Law School]]. The fundamental mission of EESI is to serve as an interdisciplinary research and policy center concerning the development and crafting of State policies, [[Energy policy of the United States|U.S. energy policies]], and global responses to the world's energy crisis; and to facilitate the attainment of a global [[sustainable energy]] future through the innovative use of laws, policies and technology solutions. In pursuit of this mission, EESI's primary operational function is that of an enabling environment for teaching, research and policy analysis vis-à-vis the impact of laws and policies on the scientific, technological, sociopolitical, commercial, and environmental dimensions of sustainable energy.

==Select energy and climate database projects==
===International Sustainable Energy Assessment (ISEA)===
ISEA is a comprehensive global database of international treaties dealing with, or relevant to, the following energy categories, ''inter alia'': conventional sources of energy such as oil, natural gas, and coal; renewable energy, such as wind, biomass, solar, geothermal, and hydro; energy efficiency and energy conservation; nuclear power; carbon capture and sequestration; and transportation. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070626070214/http://lawweb.colorado.edu/eesi/ ISEA]

===International Project on Energy Commitments and Compliance (IPECC)===
IPECC is designed to improve and enhance the efforts of governments, non-governmental actors—such as corporations, [[non-governmental organization]]s, trade unions, churches—and key decision-makers throughout the world in two ways: First by evaluating the extent to which their existing commitments and pledges are actually working; and second, by facilitating new and better clean and affordable energy solutions. IPECC will provide the information needed to improve the effectiveness of existing commitments and encourage new commitments where necessary. It is designed to track and monitor the implementation of sustainable energy commitments undertaken by governments, corporations and other entities, and to provide detailed information on the extent to which they are being complied with. In doing so it will serve as a watchdog over what is and should be happening with respect to these instruments and the commitments they embody. [http://www.colorado.edu/law/eesi/ipecc.htm IPECC]

===The EESI Climate Action Database (CAD)===
CAD contains U.S. policy proposals directed at [[climate change]]. [http://lawweb.colorado.edu/eesi/dms/ CAD] Primary document types contained in CAD include:
* Proposed Federal Legislation. Federal Legislative proposals (i.e., bills actually introduced) for climate stabilization and related energy security and national security actions to be undertaken by the U.S. President, executive administrative entities, or the U.S Congress.
* Proposals. Non-legislative proposals for climate stabilization and related energy security and national security actions to be undertaken by the U.S. President, executive administrative entities, or the U.S Congress.
* Impact Analyses. Documents that seek to ascertain the environmental, fiscal and/or carbon impacts of proposed actions.
* California and the [[RGGI|Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)]]. With respect to California, CAD contains select documents potentially applicable to the federal context. Additionally, CAD contains documents related to RGGI to that may be applicable the federal context.

Excluded from CAD proposals are documents that: (1) are older than two years old (defined as generated prior to January 1, 2005), with certain exceptions; (2) are directed at international activities or policies, unless such activities or policies are to be implemented by the President or executive administrative entities; (3) are directed at a U.S. state other than California, or a regional collaboration other than RGGI; (4) that deal with management of the federal transportation fleet or federal buildings. CAD is not, at present, a living database—meaning that it is not intended to offer an up-to-the moment repository for U.S. federal climate proposals. The material contained in CAD is generally current through February 2007.

'''Energy in Belize''' is based on four main sources: imported [[fossil fuel]]s, biomass, hydro, and imported [[electricity]].

== Energy sources ==
[[Belize]] currently imports 100% of its fossil fuel use (Launchpad Consulting, 2003).  Under the [[San Jose Pact]], which Belize signed onto in 1988, [[Mexico]] and [[Venezuela]] signed a treaty obligating them to offer a concessionary credit from 20-25% of the purchase price of their [[petroleum|oil]] exports.  In 1991, both countries increased the oil supply offered under this agreement (Belize – Mining and Energy Industry, 1992).  However, fuel prices had jumped to a record high in 2008, over $10 per gallon (Armageddon, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.onlineenergievergelijker.nl/faq/| title=energy faq }} Wednesday, 18 January 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;  

Since 1981, extensive drilling has occurred throughout Belize to find oil deposits.  Near [[Spanish Lookout]] and northwest of [[Belmopan]], two oil fields were located.  Drilling in these two fields began in 2005 and was predicted to reach a peak by 2010 (Belize, 2010). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.onlineenergievergelijker.nl/faq/| title=energy faq }} Wednesday, 18 January 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainable energy ==
Sustainable energy is the main goal for Belize.  In 2003, the Public Utilities Commission implemented a one-year project entitled Formulation for a National Energy Plan for Belize.  The project, funded by the [[United Nations Development Fund]], developed a comprehensive National Energy Policy to promote environmentally sound, safe, reliable, affordable energy (National Energy Plan, 2001).  
In 2011 this plan was updated with the Framework for the National Energy Policy. &lt;ref&gt;http://estpu.gov.bz/images/media/Energy%20Policy%20Framework.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry_of_Energy,_Science_&amp;_Technology_and_Public_Utilities|Ministry of Energy, Science &amp; Technology, and Public Utilities]] was founded following recommendations from the framework. 

Belize has also taken a role in reducing [[greenhouse gas emissions]].  The Belize and [[Nicaragua]] [[Logs Recovery project]] aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent [[deforestation]] by salvaging [[mahogany]] and other logs in the Belize and Nicaragua Rivers (Legace and Legault International Inc., 2007).  

Also, in compliance with the United Nations’ program REDD, Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, a national workshop performing with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and the Forest Department of Belize are coordinating efforts to forest management and reduction of deforestation (Protecting Belize and other Central American Countries – Reducing Emissions:  REDD, 2010).  Along with signing the San Jose Pact, Belize has also been a participant to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7330">'''Energy planning''' has a number of different meanings.  However, one common meaning of the term is the process of developing long-range policies to help guide the future of a local, national, regional or even the global energy system.  Energy planning is often conducted within Governmental organizations but may also be carried out by large energy companies such as [[Electrical utility|electric utilities]] or oil and gas producers.  Energy planning may be carried out with input from different stakeholders drawn from government agencies, local utilities, academia and other [[interest group]]s.

Energy planning is often conducted using integrated approaches that consider both the provision of energy supplies and the role of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in reducing demands ('''[[Integrated Resource Planning]]''').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synapse-energy.com/project/best-practices-electric-utility-integrated-resource-planning Best Practices in Electric Utility Integrated Resource Planning, Synapse Energy Economics, June 2013], retrieved 2015-01-09&lt;/ref&gt; Energy planning should always reflect the outcomes of population growth and economic development.

==Planning and market concepts==

Energy planning has traditionally played a strong role in setting the framework for regulations in the energy sector (for example, influencing what type of [[Power station|power plants]] might be built or what prices were charged for fuels). But in the past two decades many countries have deregulated their energy systems so that the role of energy planning has been reduced, and decisions have increasingly been left to the market. This has arguably led to increased competition in the energy sector, although there is little evidence that this has translated into lower energy prices for consumers.  Indeed, in some cases, deregulation has led to significant concentrations of "market power" with large very profitable companies having a large influence as price setters.

==Integrated Resource Planning==
Approaches to energy planning depends on the planning agent and the scope of the exercise. Several catch-phrases are associated with energy planning. Basic to all is resource planning, i.e. a view of the possible sources of energy in the future. A forking in methods is whether the planner considers the possibility of influencing the consumption (demand) for energy. [[1970s energy crisis|The 1970s energy crisis]] ended a period of relatively stable energy prices and stable supply-demand relation. Concepts of '''[[Demand Side Management]]''', '''[[Least Cost Planning]]''' and '''Integrated Resource Planning''' (IRP) emerged with new emphasis on the need to reduce energy demand by new technologies or simple energy saving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usea.org/sites/default/files/event-file/497/6_IRP_Prindle.pdf Bill Prindle: Integrated Resource Planning: Delivering Energy Services at the Lowest Total Cost, ICF International, December 12, 2011], retrieved 2015-01-09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ww2.wapa.gov/sites/Western/powerm/pmirp/Pages/pmirphistory.aspx History of Integrated Resource Planning and EPAMP, Western Area Power Administration], retrieved 2015-01-09&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act]] of 1978 [[PURPA]] and more comprehensively the [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]] introduced these concepts into the legal system, to be further detailed by individual states.
 
==Sustainable Energy Planning==
Further global integration of energy supply systems and local and global environmental limits amplifies the scope of planning both in subject and time perspective. Sustainable Energy Planning should consider [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impacts]] of energy consumption and production, particularly in light of the threat of [[Climate change|global climate change]], which is caused largely by emissions of [[greenhouse gas]]es from the world's energy systems, which is a long-term process.

Many [[OECD]] countries and some U.S. states are now moving to more closely regulate their energy systems.  For example, many countries and states have been adopting targets for emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases.  In light of these developments, broad scope integrated energy planning could become increasingly important &lt;ref&gt;Martire, S., Tuomasjukka, D., Lindner, M., Fitzgerald, J., &amp; Castellani, V. (2015). [http://authors.elsevier.com/a/1Rh813QkGxd0Si Sustainability Impact Assessment for local energy supplies' development. Biomass and Bioenergy 83].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable Energy Planning takes a more holistic approach to the problem of planning for future energy needs. It is based on a structured decision making process based on six key steps, namely:

1. Exploration of the context of the current and future situation

2. Formulation of particular problems and opportunities which need to be addressed as part of the Sustainable Energy Planning process. This could include such issues as "Peak Oil" or "Economic Recession/Depression", as well as the development of energy demand technologies.

3. Create a range of models to predict the likely impact of different scenarios. This traditionally would consist of mathematical modelling but is evolving to include "[[Soft systems methodology|Soft System Methodologies]]" such as focus groups, peer ethnographic research, "what if" logical scenarios etc.

4. Based on the output from a wide range of modelling exercises and literature reviews, open forum discussion etc., the results are analysed and structured in an easily interpreted format.

5. The results are then interpreted in order to determine the scope, scale and likely implementation methodologies which would be required to ensure successful implementation.

6. This stage is a quality assurance process which actively interrogates each stage of the Sustainable Energy Planning process and checks if it has been carried out rigorously, without any bias and that it furthers the aims of sustainable development and does not act against them.

7. The last stage of the process is to take action. This may consist of the development, publication and implementation of a range of policies, regulations, procedures or tasks which together will help to achieve the goals of the Sustainable Energy Plan.

Designing for implementation is often carried out using "Logical Framework Analysis" which interrogates a proposed project and checks that it is completely logical, that it has no fatal errors and that appropriate contingency arrangements have been put in place to ensure that the complete project will not fail if a particular strand of the project fails.

Sustainable energy planning is particularly appropriate for communities who want to develop their own energy security, while employing best available practice in their planning processes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[File:Pruszkowski Fern flower.jpg|thumb|200px|''Fern flower'' (1875) by [[Witold Pruszkowski]], [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]]]

The '''fern flower''' is a [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] flower in [[Baltic mythology]] ({{lang-lt|paparčio žiedas}}, {{lang-lv|papardes zieds}}), in [[Estonian mythology]] ({{lang-et|sõnajalaõis}}) and in [[Slavic mythology]] ({{lang-be|папараць-кветка}}, {{lang-pl|kwiat paproci}}, {{lang-ru|цветок папоротника}}, {{lang-uk|цвіт папороті}}).

== Tradition ==
According to the myth, this flower blooms for a very short time on the eve of the [[summer solstice]] (celebrated on June 21 or sometimes July 7) The flower brings fortune to the person who finds it. In various versions of the tale, the fern flower brings luck, wealth, or the ability to understand [[animal speech]]. However, the flower is closely guarded by [[evil spirits]] and anyone who finds the flower will have access to [[Christian views on poverty and wealth|earthly riches]], which have never benefited anyone, so the decision to pick the flower or leave it alone is left up to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paparčio žiedo legenda - būdas kiekvienam pasijusti herojumi |url=https://www.delfi.lt/grynas/gyvenimas/paparcio-ziedo-legenda-budas-kiekvienam-pasijusti-herojumi.d?id=46907109 |website=DELFI.lt |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditions in the Baltic and Nordic countries ==

===Baltic and Estonian-Finnish tradition===
In the Estonian, Lithuanian and [[Latvian culture|Latvian tradition]], the fern flower is supposed to appear only on the night of 23 to 24 June during the celebration of the [[summer solstice]] which is called [[Jāņi]] in Latvia, [[Saint Jonas' Festival|Joninės]] or [[Saint Jonas' Festival|Rasos]] in Lithuania, [[Jaaniõhtu]] or Jaaniöö in Estonia and [[Midsummer#Finland|juhannus]] in Finland. The celebration has pre-Christian origins. In addition to the idea that the finder of the fern flower will become rich or happy, here, the fern flower is sometimes perceived a symbol of [[fertility]]. During this supposedly magical night, young couples go into the woods "seeking the fern flower", which is most commonly read as a euphemism for [[Human sexual activity|sex]].{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Sex can lead to pregnancy; the child could be thought of as the fern flower.

Referring to this tradition, [http://www.papardeszieds.lv Papardes zieds] ("fern flower" in Latvian) is  the name of an [[NGO]] in Latvia that promotes education about matters pertaining to [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], fertility, and relationships.

=== Swedish tradition ===
Similar beliefs are attested in [[Sweden]], where the fern flower was said to be found only at midnight on [[Midsummer's Eve]], and even then was protected by magic and thus hard to obtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ericsson |first1=Gustaf |url=http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/download/18.5850f85e15732ead0b31ec/1474033342450/Folklivet+i+%C3%85kers+och+Rekarne+h%C3%A4rader_3_Tro+-+vantro+-+%C3%B6vertro.pdf |format=PDF |title=Folklivet i Åkers och Rekarne härader |trans-title=Everyday Life in the Districts of Åker and Rekarne |language=Swedish |volume=3 |editor-last=Hellquist |editor-first=Magdalena |location=Uppsala |publisher=The Institute of Dialect and Folklore Research |year=1992 ||orig-year=First published 1877-78 |pages=88, 176, 190 |isbn=978-91-85540-57-0 |accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also applied to [[Equisetum|horsetail]] and [[Daphne mezereum|daphne]] flowers; of daphne, a flowering plant, it was said: "The flowers are a rarity if picked on nights when they are ''believed'' to bloom. The naturally occurring flowers no one believes to be daphne flowers."&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Blommor äro en raritet om de tagas de nätter de ''tros'' blomma. De blommor som äro naturliga tror ingen vara tibastblommor." Ericsson, ''Folklivet i Åkers och Rekarne härader'', p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Slavic tradition ==

===Ukrainian, Belarus and Polish tradition===
In [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and [[Poland]], the holiday is practiced on the eve of [[Ivan Kupala Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ua-traveling.com/en/article/ivan-kupala Midsummer celebration (Celebration of Ivan Kupala Day)]&lt;/ref&gt; Young girls wear wreaths in their hair and couples go into the woods searching for the fern flower. When they come out of the woods, if the male is wearing the girl's wreath, it means the couple is engaged to be married.

According to folklore, the flower is [[Chervona Ruta]]. The flower is yellow, but according to legend, it turns red on the eve of Ivan Kupala Day.

== Blooming ferns ==

A '''heat recovery steam generator''' ('''HRSG''') is an [[energy recovery]] [[heat exchanger]] that recovers heat from a hot gas stream. It produces [[steam]] that can be used in a process ([[cogeneration]]) or used to drive a [[steam turbine]] ([[combined cycle]]).

==HRSGs==
[[Image:HRSGPoster.jpg|thumb|Modular HRSG GA]]
HRSGs consist of four major components: the [[economizer]], [[evaporator]], [[superheater]] and water preheater {{what||December 2016 an economizer is used to preheat, what is the second preheater?|date=December 2016}}.  The different components are put together to meet the operating requirements of the unit. See the attached illustration of a Modular HRSG General Arrangement.

Modular HRSGs can be categorized by a number of ways such as direction of [[exhaust gas]]es flow or number of pressure levels. Based on the flow of exhaust gases, HRSGs are categorized into vertical and horizontal types. In horizontal type HRSGs, exhaust gas flows horizontally over vertical tubes whereas in vertical type HRSGs, exhaust gas flow vertically over horizontal tubes. Based on pressure levels, HRSGs can be categorized into single pressure and multi pressure. Single pressure HRSGs have only one [[steam drum]] and steam is generated at single pressure level whereas multi pressure HRSGs employ two (double pressure) or three (triple pressure) steam drums. As such triple pressure HRSGs consist of three sections: an LP (low pressure) section, a reheat/IP (intermediate pressure) section, and an HP (high pressure) section. Each section has a steam drum and an [[evaporator]] section where water is converted to steam. This steam then passes through superheaters to raise the temperature beyond the [[humidity|saturation]] point.

==Packaged HRSGs==
Packaged HRSGs are designed to be shipped as a fully assembled unit from the factory. They can be used in [[waste heat]] or turbine (usually under 20 MW) applications. The packaged HRSG can have a water-cooled furnace, which allows for higher supplemental firing and better overall efficiency.

==Variations==
Some HRSGs include supplemental, or duct firing. These additional burners provide additional energy to the HRSG, which produces more steam and hence increases the output of the [[steam turbine]]. Generally, duct firing provides electrical output at lower capital cost. It is therefore often utilized for peaking operations.

HRSGs can also have diverter valves to regulate the inlet flow into the HRSG. This allows the gas turbine to continue to operate when there is no steam demand or if the HRSG needs to be taken offline.

Emissions controls may also be located in the HRSG. Some may contain a [[Selective Catalytic Reduction]] system to reduce [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]] (a large contributor to the formation of smog and acid rain) and/or a catalyst to remove [[carbon monoxide]]. The inclusion of an SCR dramatically affects the layout of the HRSG.  NOx catalyst performs best in temperatures between 650&amp;nbsp;°F (340&amp;nbsp;°C) and 750&amp;nbsp;°F (400&amp;nbsp;°C). This usually means that the evaporator section of the HRSG will have to be split and the SCR placed in between the two sections. Some low temperature NOx catalysts have recently come to market that allows for the SCR to be placed between the Evaporator and Economizer sections (350&amp;nbsp;°F - 500&amp;nbsp;°F (175&amp;nbsp;°C - 260&amp;nbsp;°C)).
[[Image:PackagedHRSG.jpg|thumb|Packaged HRSG]]

==Once-through steam generator (OTSG)==
{{anchor|Once-through steam generator}}
A specialized type of HRSG without boiler drums is the once-through steam generator.  In this design, the inlet feedwater follows a continuous path without segmented sections for economizers, evaporators, and superheaters.  This provides a high degree of flexibility as the sections are allowed to grow or contract based on the [[heat load]] being received from the gas turbine.  The absence of drums allows for quick changes in steam production and fewer variables to control, and is ideal for cycling and base load operation.  With proper material selection, an OTSG can be run dry, meaning the hot exhaust gases can pass over the tubes with no water flowing inside the tubes. This eliminates the need for a bypass stack and exhaust gas diverter system which is required to operate a combustion turbine with a drum-type HRSG out of service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otsg.com www.otsg.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
* Heat recovery can be used extensively in energy projects.
* In the energy-rich [[Persian Gulf]] region, the steam from the HRSG is used for [[desalination]] plants.
* Universities are ideal candidates for HRSG applications.  They can use a gas turbine to produce high reliability electricity for campus use.  The HRSG can recover the heat from the gas turbine to produce steam/hot water for [[district heating]] or cooling.
* Large ocean vessels (e.g. [[Emma Maersk]]) make use of heat recovery so that their oil-fired boilers can be shut down while underway.

== Introduction ==
{{Standard model of particle physics}}

=== The Standard Model ===
Physicists explain the properties of and forces between [[elementary particle]]s in terms of the [[Standard Model]] &amp;ndash; a widely accepted framework for understanding almost everything in the known universe, other than [[gravity]]. (A separate theory, [[General Relativity]], is used for gravity.) In this model, the [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] in nature arise from properties of our universe called [[Introduction to gauge theory|gauge invariance]] and [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]]. The forces are [[force carrier|transmitted by particles]] known as [[gauge boson]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|2008|pp=49–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tipler|Llewellyn|2003|pp=603–604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Standard Model, the Higgs particle is a [[boson]] with [[spin (physics)|spin]] zero, no [[electric charge]] and no [[color charge|colour charge]]. It is also very unstable, [[particle decay|decaying]] into other particles almost immediately. The Higgs field is a [[scalar field|scalar]] [[field (physics)|field]], with two neutral and two electrically charged components that form a complex [[doublet (physics)|doublet]] of the [[weak isospin]] [[SU(2)]] symmetry. The Higgs field has a "[[Spontaneous symmetry breaking#Mexican hat potential|Mexican hat-shaped]]" potential. In its [[vacuum state|ground state]], this causes the field to have a nonzero value everywhere (including otherwise empty space), and as a result, below a very high energy it breaks the [[weak isospin]] symmetry of the [[electroweak interaction]]. (Technically the non-zero expectation value converts the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]'s Yukawa coupling terms into mass terms.) When this happens, three components of the Higgs field are "absorbed" by the SU(2) and U(1) [[gauge boson]]s (the "[[Higgs mechanism]]") to become the longitudinal components of the [[mass generation|now-massive]] [[W and Z bosons]] of the [[weak force]]. The remaining electrically neutral component either manifests as a Higgs particle, or may couple separately to other particles known as [[fermion]]s (via [[Yukawa coupling]]s), causing these to [[mass generation|acquire mass]] as well.

=== The problem of gauge boson mass ===
Field theories had been used with great success in understanding the [[electromagnetic field]] and the [[strong force]], but by around 1960 all attempts to create a ''gauge invariant'' theory for the [[weak force]] (and its combination with [[fundamental interaction|fundamental force]] [[electromagnetism]], the [[electroweak interaction]]) had consistently failed, with gauge theories thereby starting to fall into disrepute as a result. The problem was that the symmetry requirements in [[gauge theory]] predicted that both electromagnetism's gauge boson (the [[photon]]) and the weak force's gauge bosons ([[W and Z bosons|W and Z]]) should have zero mass. Although the photon is indeed massless, experiments show that the weak force's bosons have mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|2008|pp=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that either gauge invariance was an incorrect approach, or something else &amp;ndash; unknown &amp;ndash; was giving these particles their mass, but all attempts to suggest a theory able to solve this problem just seemed to create new theoretical issues.

In the late 1950s, physicists had "no idea" how to resolve these issues, which were significant obstacles to developing a full-fledged theory for particle physics.

==== Symmetry breaking ====
By the early 1960s, physicists had realised that [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|a given symmetry law might not always be followed]] under certain conditions, at least in some areas of physics.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;It is quite common for a law of physics to hold true only if certain assumptions held true or only under certain conditions. For example, [[Newton's laws of motion]] apply only at speeds where [[Special relativity|relativistic effects]] are negligible; and laws related to conductivity, gases, and classical physics (as opposed to quantum mechanics) may apply only within certain ranges of size, temperature, pressure, or other conditions.&lt;/ref&gt; This is called [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry breaking]] and was recognised in the late 1950s by [[Yoichiro Nambu]]. Symmetry breaking can lead to surprising and unexpected results. In 1962 physicist [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]] &amp;ndash; an expert in [[superconductivity]] &amp;ndash; wrote a paper that considered symmetry breaking in particle physics, and suggested that perhaps symmetry breaking might be the missing piece needed to solve the problems of gauge invariance in particle physics. If electroweak symmetry was somehow being broken, it might explain why electromagnetism's boson is massless, yet the weak force bosons have mass, and solve the problems. Shortly afterwards, in 1963, this was shown to be theoretically possible, at least for some limited cases.

===Higgs mechanism===
{{Main|Higgs mechanism}}
Following the 1962 and 1963 papers, three groups of researchers independently published the [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers]] with similar conclusions: that the conditions for electroweak symmetry would be "broken" if an unusual type of [[field (physics)|field]] existed throughout the universe, and indeed, some fundamental particles would [[mass generation|acquire mass]]. The field required for this to happen (which was purely hypothetical at the time) became known as the ''Higgs field'' (after [[Peter Higgs]], one of the researchers) and the mechanism by which it led to symmetry breaking, known as the ''[[Higgs mechanism]]''. A key feature of the necessary field is that it would take ''less'' energy for the field to have a non-zero value than a zero value, unlike all other known fields, therefore, the Higgs field has a non-zero value (or ''vacuum expectation'') ''everywhere''. It was the first proposal capable of showing how the weak force gauge bosons could have mass despite their governing symmetry, within a gauge invariant theory.

Although these ideas did not gain much initial support or attention, by 1972 they had been developed into a comprehensive theory and proved capable of giving [[renormalization|"sensible" results]] that accurately described particles known at the time, and which, with exceptional accuracy, [[Standard Model#Tests and predictions|predicted several other particles discovered during the following years]].&lt;ref name="predictions" group=lower-alpha&gt;The success of the Higgs-based electroweak theory and Standard Model is illustrated by their [[Standard Model#Tests and predictions|predictions]] of the mass of two particles later detected: the W boson (predicted mass: {{nowrap|80.390 ± 0.018 GeV}}, experimental measurement: {{nowrap|80.387 ± 0.019 GeV}}), and the Z boson (predicted mass: {{nowrap|91.1874 ± 0.0021}}, experimental measurement: {{nowrap|91.1876 ± 0.0021 GeV}}). The existence of the Z boson was another prediction. Other accurate predictions included the [[weak neutral current]], the [[gluon]], and the [[top quark|top]] and [[charm quark]]s, all later proven to exist as the theory said.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s these theories rapidly became the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics. There was not yet any direct evidence that the Higgs field existed, but even without proof of the field, the accuracy of its predictions led scientists to believe the theory might be true. By the 1980s the question of whether or not the Higgs field existed, and therefore whether or not the entire Standard Model was correct, had come to be regarded as one of the most important [[Unanswered questions in physics|unanswered questions in particle physics]].

====Higgs field====
According to the Standard Model, a [[field (physics)|field]] of the necessary kind (the ''Higgs field'') exists throughout space and breaks certain symmetry laws of the [[electroweak interaction]].&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Electroweak symmetry is broken by the Higgs field in its lowest energy state, called its ''[[ground state]]''. At high energy levels this does not happen, and the gauge bosons of the weak force would therefore be expected to be massless.&lt;/ref&gt; Via the Higgs mechanism, this field causes the gauge bosons of the weak force to be massive at all temperatures below an extreme high value. When the weak force bosons acquire mass, this affects their range, which  becomes very small.{{#tag:ref |The range of a force is inversely proportional to the mass of the particles transmitting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Standard Model, forces are carried by [[virtual particles]]. The movement and interactions of these particles with each other are limited by the energy–time [[uncertainty principle]]. As a result, the more massive a single virtual particle is, the greater its energy, and therefore the shorter the distance it can travel. A particle's mass therefore, determines the maximum distance at which it can interact with other particles and on any force it mediates. By the same token, the reverse is also true: massless and near-massless particles can carry long distance forces. ''(See also: [[Compton wavelength]] and [[static forces and virtual-particle exchange]])'' Since experiments have shown that the weak force acts over only a very short range, this implies that massive gauge bosons must exist, and indeed, their masses have since been confirmed by measurement.|group=lower-alpha |name="massvsrange"}} Furthermore, it was later realised that the same field would also explain, in a different way, why other fundamental constituents of matter (including [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s) have mass.

For many decades, scientists had no way to determine whether or not the Higgs field existed, because the technology needed for its detection did not exist at that time. If the Higgs field did exist, then it would be unlike any other known fundamental field, but it also was possible that these key ideas, or even the entire Standard Model, were somehow incorrect.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;By the 1960s, many had already started to see gauge theories as failing to explain particle physics, because theorists had been unable to solve the mass problem or even explain how gauge theory could provide a solution. So the idea that the Standard Model – which relied on a Higgs field, not yet proved to exist – could be fundamentally incorrect, was not unreasonable. Against this, once the model was developed around 1972, no better theory existed, and its predictions and solutions were so accurate, that it became the preferred theory anyway. It then became crucial to science, to know whether or not it was ''correct''.&lt;/ref&gt; Only discovering that the Higgs boson and therefore the Higgs field existed solved the problem.

Unlike other known fields such as the [[electromagnetic field]], the Higgs field is [[scalar field|scalar]] and has a non-zero constant value in [[Vacuum state|vacuum]]. The existence of the Higgs field became the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics, and for several decades, was considered "the central problem in particle physics".&lt;ref name="Proceedings_1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Higgs_Hunters_Guide" /&gt;

The presence of the field, now confirmed by experimental investigation, explains [[mass generation|why some fundamental particles have mass]], despite the [[symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] controlling their interactions implying that they should be massless. It also resolves several other long-standing puzzles, such as the reason for the extremely short range of the [[weak interaction|weak force]].

Although the Higgs field is non-zero everywhere and its effects are ubiquitous, proving its existence was far from easy. In principle, it can be proved to exist by detecting its [[excited state|excitations]], which manifest as Higgs particles (the ''Higgs boson''), but these are extremely difficult to produce and detect. The importance of this [[Unanswered questions in physics|fundamental question]] led to a [[Search for the Higgs boson|40-year search]], and the construction of one of the world's most [[List of megaprojects#Science projects|expensive and complex experimental facilities]] to date, [[European Organisation for Nuclear Research|CERN]]'s [[Large Hadron Collider]],&lt;ref name="Strassler article"&gt;{{cite web

====Higgs boson====
The hypothesised Higgs mechanism made several accurate predictions,&lt;ref name="predictions" group=lower-alpha /&gt;&lt;ref name="L&amp;T" /&gt;{{rp|22}} however to confirm its existence there was an extensive [[Search for the Higgs boson|search for]] a matching [[subatomic particle|particle]] associated with it — the "Higgs boson".&lt;ref name="OnyisiFAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="strasslerFAQ2" /&gt; Detecting Higgs bosons was difficult due to the energy required to produce them and their very rare production even if the energy is sufficient. It was therefore several decades before the first evidence of the Higgs boson was found. [[Particle collider]]s, detectors, and computers capable of looking for Higgs bosons took more than 30 years {{nowrap|(c. 1980–2010)}} to develop.

By March 2013, the existence of the Higgs boson was confirmed, and therefore, the concept of some type of Higgs field throughout space is strongly supported.&lt;ref name="dieter July 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CERN Nov 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CERN March 2013"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature and properties of this field are now being investigated further, using more data collected at the LHC.&lt;ref name="CERN_EPS2017" /&gt;

==== Interpretation ====
[[#Media explanations and analogies|Various analogies]] have been used to describe the Higgs field and boson, including analogies with well-known symmetry-breaking effects such as the [[rainbow]] and [[dispersive prism|prism]], [[electric field]]s, ripples, and resistance of macro objects moving through media (such as people moving through crowds or some objects moving through [[syrup]] or [[molasses]]). However, analogies based on simple resistance to motion are inaccurate, as the Higgs field does not work by resisting motion.

== Significance ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
{{originalresearch-section|date=January 2015}}
Evidence of the Higgs field and its properties has been extremely significant for many reasons. The importance of the Higgs boson is largely that it is able to be examined using existing knowledge and experimental technology, as a way to confirm and study the entire Higgs field theory.&lt;ref name="OnyisiFAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="strasslerFAQ2" /&gt; Conversely, proof that the Higgs field and boson do ''not'' exist would have also been significant.

=== Particle physics ===
==== Validation of the Standard Model ====
The Higgs boson validates the [[Standard Model]] through the mechanism of [[mass generation]]. As more precise measurements of its properties are made, more advanced extensions may be suggested or excluded. As experimental means to measure the field's behaviours and interactions are developed, this fundamental field may be better understood. If the Higgs field had not been discovered, the Standard Model would have needed to be modified or superseded.

Related to this, a belief generally exists among physicists that there is likely to be "new" [[physics beyond the Standard Model]], and the Standard Model will at some point be extended or superseded. The Higgs discovery, as well as the many measured collisions occurring at the LHC, provide physicists a sensitive tool to parse data for where the Standard Model fails, and could provide considerable evidence guiding researchers into future theoretical developments.

==== Symmetry breaking of the electroweak interaction ====
Below an extremely high temperature, [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] causes the [[electroweak interaction]] to manifest in part as the short-ranged [[weak force]], which is carried by massive [[gauge boson]]s. This symmetry breaking is required for [[atom]]s and other structures to form, as well as for nuclear reactions in stars, such as our [[Sun]]. The Higgs field is responsible for this symmetry breaking.

==== Particle mass acquisition ====
The Higgs field is pivotal in [[Mass generation|generating the masses]] of [[quark]]s and charged [[leptons]] (through Yukawa coupling) and the [[W and Z bosons|W and Z]] [[gauge boson]]s (through the Higgs mechanism).

It is worth noting that the Higgs field does not "create" mass [[creatio ex nihilo|out of nothing]] (which would violate the [[law of conservation of energy]]), nor is the Higgs field responsible for the mass of all particles. For example, approximately 99% of the mass of [[baryon]]s ([[composite particle]]s such as the [[proton]] and [[neutron]]), is due instead to [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy]], which is the sum of the [[kinetic energy|kinetic energies]] of quarks and the [[gluon energy|energies]] of the massless [[gluon]]s mediating the [[strong interaction]] inside the baryons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/why-would-i-care-about-higgs-boson|title=Why would I care about the Higgs boson?|last=Rao|first=Achintya|date=2 July 2012|publisher=CERN|website=CMS Public Website|accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Higgs-based theories, the property of "mass" is a manifestation of [[potential energy]] transferred to fundamental particles when they interact ("couple") with the Higgs field, which had contained that mass [[mass–energy equivalence|in the form of energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Jammer, ''Concepts of Mass in Contemporary Physics and Philosophy'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000) pp.162–163, who provides many references in support of this statement.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Scalar fields and extension of the Standard Model ====
The Higgs field is the only scalar (spin&amp;nbsp;0) field to be detected; all the other fields in the Standard Model are spin&amp;nbsp;½ [[fermions]] or spin&amp;nbsp;1 bosons. According to [[Rolf-Dieter Heuer]], director general of CERN when the Higgs boson was discovered, this existence proof of a scalar field is almost as important as the Higgs's role in determining the mass of other particles. It suggests that other hypothetical scalar fields suggested by other theories, from the [[inflaton]] to [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], could perhaps exist as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dvorsky|first1=George|title=Is there a link between the Higgs boson and dark energy?|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/is-there-a-link-between-the-higgs-boson-and-dark-energy-1109308709|accessdate=1 March 2018|work=io9|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What Universe Is This, Anyway?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/04/02/297853038/what-universe-is-this-anyway|accessdate=1 March 2018|work=NPR.org|date=2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmology ===
==== Inflaton====
There has been considerable scientific research on possible links between the Higgs field and the [[inflaton]] – a hypothetical field suggested as the explanation for the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] during [[Chronology of the universe|the first fraction of a second]] of the [[universe]] (known as the "[[inflationary epoch]]"). Some theories suggest that a fundamental scalar field might be responsible for this phenomenon; the Higgs field is such a field, and its existence has led to papers analysing whether it could also be the ''inflaton'' responsible for this [[exponential growth|exponential]] expansion of the universe during the [[Big Bang]]. Such theories are highly tentative and face significant problems related to [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity]], but may be viable if combined with additional features such as large non-minimal coupling, a [[Brans–Dicke theory|Brans–Dicke]] scalar, or other "new" physics, and they have received treatments suggesting that Higgs inflation models are still of interest theoretically.

Quantum fields can have states of differing stability, including 'stable', 'unstable' and '[[Metastability|metastable]]' states (the latter remain stable unless sufficiently [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbed]]). If a more stable vacuum state were able to arise, then existing particles and forces would no longer arise as they presently do. Different particles or forces would arise from (and be shaped by) whatever new quantum states arose. The world we know depends upon these particles and forces, so if this happened, everything around us, from [[subatomic particle]]s to [[Galaxy|galaxies]], and all [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]], would be reconstituted into new fundamental particles and forces and structures. The universe would potentially lose all of its present structures and become inhabited by new ones (depending upon the exact states involved) based upon the same quantum fields.&lt;/ref&gt; It also suggests that the Higgs [[self-coupling]] ''λ'' and its ''β''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; function could be very close to zero at the Planck scale, with "intriguing" implications, including theories of gravity and Higgs-based inflation.&lt;ref name="Alekhin 2012" /&gt;{{rp|218}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bezrukov |first1=F. |last2=Shaposhnikov |first2=M. |date=2008-01-24 |title=The Standard Model Higgs boson as the inflaton |journal=Physics Letters B |volume=659 |issue=3 |pages=703–706 |arxiv=0710.3755 |bibcode=2008PhLB..659..703B |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2007.11.072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salvio |first=Alberto |date=2013-08-09 |title=Higgs Inflation at NNLO after the Boson Discovery |url=http://inspirehep.net/record/1247471 |journal=Physics Letters B |volume=727 |issue=1–3 |pages=234–239 |arxiv=1308.2244 |bibcode=2013PhLB..727..234S |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2013.10.042 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A future electron–positron collider would be able to provide the precise measurements of the top quark needed for such calculations.&lt;ref name="Alekhin 2012" /&gt;

==== Vacuum energy and the cosmological constant ====
{{further|Zero-point energy|Vacuum state}}More speculatively, the Higgs field has also been proposed as the [[Vacuum energy|energy of the vacuum]], which at the extreme energies of the first moments of the [[Big Bang]] caused the universe to be a kind of featureless symmetry of undifferentiated, extremely high energy. In this kind of speculation, the single unified field of a [[Grand Unified Theory]] is identified as (or modelled upon) the Higgs field, and it is through successive symmetry breakings of the Higgs field, or some similar field, at [[phase transition]]s that the presently known forces and fields of the universe arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/14/local/me-65457 |title=One Thing Is Perfectly Clear: Nothingness Is Perfect |last=Cole |first=K.C. |date=2000-12-14 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |quote=[T]he Higgs' influence (or the influence of something like it) could reach much further. For example, something like the Higgs—if not exactly the Higgs itself—may be behind many other unexplained "broken symmetries" in the universe as well ... In fact, something very much like the Higgs may have been behind the collapse of the symmetry that led to the Big Bang, which created the universe. When the forces first began to separate from their primordial sameness—taking on the distinct characters they have today—they released energy in the same way as water releases energy when it turns to ice. Except in this case, the freezing packed enough energy to blow up the universe. ... However it happened, the moral is clear: Only when the perfection shatters can everything else be born.|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship (if any) between the Higgs field and the presently observed [[Vacuum energy|vacuum energy density]] of the universe has also come under scientific study. As observed, the present vacuum energy density is extremely close to zero, but the energy density expected from the Higgs field, supersymmetry, and other current theories are typically many orders of magnitude larger. It is unclear how these should be reconciled. This [[cosmological constant]] problem remains a further major [[Unanswered questions in physics|unanswered problem]] in physics.

=== Practical and technological impact ===
As yet, there are no known immediate technological benefits of finding the Higgs particle. However, a common pattern for fundamental discoveries is for practical applications to follow later, and once the discovery has been explored further, perhaps becoming the basis for new technologies of importance to society.&lt;ref name="NYT practical"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/opinion/global/kathy-sykes-higgs-matters.html Higgs Matters] – Kathy Sykes, 30 Nove 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APS practical"&gt;[http://www.aps.org/publications/capitolhillquarterly/201207/higgsbosom.cfm Why the public should care about the Higgs Boson] – Jodi Lieberman, [[American Physical Society]] (APS)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strassler practical"&gt;[http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters Matt Strassler's blog – Why the Higgs particle matters] 2 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenges in particle physics have furthered major technological progress of widespread importance. For example, the [[World Wide Web]] began as a project to improve CERN's communication system. CERN's requirement to process massive amounts of data produced by the Large Hadron Collider also led to contributions to the fields of [[distributed computing|distributed]] and [[cloud computing]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}.

Particle physicists study [[matter]] made from [[fundamental particle]]s whose interactions are mediated by exchange particles – [[gauge boson]]s – acting as [[force carrier]]s. At the beginning of the 1960s a number of these particles had been discovered or proposed, along with theories suggesting how they relate to each other, some of which had already been reformulated as [[quantum field theory|field theories]] in which the objects of study are not particles and forces, but [[quantum field]]s and their [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]].&lt;ref name="Carroll2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Carroll|title=The Particle at the End of the Universe: How the Hunt for the Higgs Boson Leads Us to the Edge of a New World|date=13 November 2012|publisher=Penguin Group US|isbn=978-1-101-60970-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|150}} However, attempts to produce quantum field models for two of the four known [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] – the [[electromagnetic force]] and the [[weak nuclear force]] – and then to [[Unified field theory|unify these interactions]], were still unsuccessful.

One known problem was that [[gauge invariance|gauge invariant]] approaches, including [[non-abelian gauge theory|non-abelian]] models such as [[Yang–Mills theory]] (1954), which held great promise for unified theories, also seemed to predict known massive particles as massless.&lt;ref name=woit&gt;{{cite web|last=Woit|first=Peter|title=The Anderson–Higgs Mechanism|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=3282|publisher=Dr. Peter Woit (Senior Lecturer in Mathematics [[Columbia University]] and Ph.D. particle physics)|accessdate=12 November 2012|date=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goldstone's theorem]], relating to [[continuous symmetry|continuous symmetries]] within some theories, also appeared to rule out many obvious solutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Goldstone |first =J |year= 1962 |title= Broken Symmetries |journal= Physical Review |volume= 127 |pages= 965–970 |doi =10.1103/PhysRev.127.965 |last2 =Salam |first2 =Abdus |last3 =Weinberg |first3 =Steven |bibcode= 1962PhRv..127..965G |issue =3 |ref =harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; since it appeared to show that zero-mass particles also would have to exist that simply were "not seen".&lt;ref name="Guralnik 2011"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Guralnik |first=G.

Particle physicist and mathematician Peter Woit summarised the state of research at the time:

{{quote|Yang and Mills work on [[non-abelian gauge theory]] had one huge problem: in [[perturbation theory]] it has massless particles which don’t correspond to anything we see. One way of getting rid of this problem is now fairly well understood, the phenomenon of [[color confinement|confinement]] realized in [[quantum chromodynamics|QCD]], where the strong interactions get rid of the massless “gluon” states at long distances. By the very early sixties, people had begun to understand another source of massless particles: spontaneous symmetry breaking of a continuous symmetry. What [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]] realized and worked out in the summer of 1962 was that, when you have ''both'' gauge symmetry ''and'' spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Nambu–Goldstone massless mode can combine with the massless gauge field modes to produce a physical massive vector field. This is what happens in [[superconductivity]], a subject about which Anderson was (and is) one of the leading experts.&lt;ref name="woit" /&gt; ''[text condensed]''}}

The Higgs mechanism is a process by which [[vector boson]]s can acquire [[rest mass]] ''without'' [[explicit symmetry breaking|explicitly breaking]] [[gauge invariance]], as a byproduct of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]].&lt;ref name="scholarpedia"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kibble |first=T.

=== Experimental search ===
{{Main|Search for the Higgs boson}}
To [[#Production|produce Higgs bosons]], two beams of particles are accelerated to very high energies and allowed to collide within a [[particle detector]]. Occasionally, although rarely, a Higgs boson will be created fleetingly as part of the collision byproducts. Because the Higgs boson [[#Decay|decays]] very quickly, particle detectors cannot detect it directly. Instead the detectors register all the decay products (the ''decay signature'') and from the data the decay process is reconstructed. If the observed decay products match a possible decay process (known as a ''decay channel'') of a Higgs boson, this indicates that a Higgs boson may have been created. In practice, many processes may produce similar decay signatures. Fortunately, the Standard Model precisely predicts the likelihood of each of these, and each known process, occurring. So, if the detector detects more decay signatures consistently matching a Higgs boson than would otherwise be expected if Higgs bosons did not exist, then this would be strong evidence that the Higgs boson exists.

Because Higgs boson production in a particle collision is likely to be very rare (1 in 10 billion at the LHC),{{#tag:ref|The example is based on the production rate at the LHC operating at 7 TeV. The total cross-section for producing a Higgs boson at the LHC is about 10 [[picobarn]],&lt;ref name="HprodLHC" /&gt; while the total cross-section for a proton–proton collision is 110 [[millibarn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name="production_rate"|group=lower-alpha}} and many other possible collision events can have similar decay signatures, the data of hundreds of trillions of collisions needs to be analysed and must "show the same picture" before a conclusion about the existence of the Higgs boson can be reached. To conclude that a new particle has been found, [[particle physicist]]s require that the [[statistical analysis]] of two independent particle detectors each indicate that there is lesser than a one-in-a-million chance that the observed decay signatures are due to just background random Standard Model events—i.e., that the observed number of events is more than 5 [[standard deviation]]s (sigma) different from that expected if there was no new particle. More collision data allows better confirmation of the physical properties of any new particle observed, and allows physicists to decide whether it is indeed a Higgs boson as described by the Standard Model or some other hypothetical new particle.

To find the Higgs boson, a powerful [[particle accelerator]] was needed, because Higgs bosons might not be seen in lower-energy experiments. The collider needed to have a high [[Luminosity (scattering theory)|luminosity]] in order to ensure enough collisions were seen for conclusions to be drawn. Finally, advanced computing facilities were needed to process the vast amount of data (25 [[petabyte]]s per year as of 2012) produced by the collisions.&lt;ref name="msnbc-discovery" /&gt; For the announcement of 4 July 2012, a new collider known as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] was constructed at [[CERN]] with a planned eventual collision energy of 14 [[TeV]]—over seven times any previous collider—and over 300 trillion (3×10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;) LHC proton–proton collisions were analysed by the [[LHC Computing Grid]], the world's largest [[computing grid]] (as of 2012), comprising over 170 computing facilities in a [[distributed computing|worldwide network]] across 36 countries.&lt;ref name="msnbc-discovery" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wlcg.web.cern.ch/ |title=Welcome to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |website=WLCG – Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |publisher=CERN |access-date=14 November 2012 |quote=[A] global collaboration of more than 170 computing centres in 36 countries … to store, distribute and analyse the ~25 Petabytes (25 million Gigabytes) of data annually generated by the Large Hadron Collider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://home.cern/about/computing/worldwide-lhc-computing-grid |title=The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |website=The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |publisher=CERN |date=November 2017 |quote=It now links thousands of computers and storage systems in over 170 centres across 41 countries. … The WLCG is the world's largest computing grid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Search before 4 July 2012 ====
The first extensive search for the Higgs boson was conducted at the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]] (LEP) at CERN in the 1990s. At the end of its service in 2000, LEP had found no conclusive evidence for the Higgs.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Just before LEP's shut down, some events that hinted at a Higgs were observed, but it was not judged significant enough to extend its run and delay construction of the LHC.&lt;/ref&gt; This implied that if the Higgs boson were to exist it would have to be heavier than {{val|114.4|u=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="Yao 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author=W.-M. Yao|year=2006|title=Review of Particle Physics|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2006/reviews/higgs_s055.pdf |journal=[[Journal of Physics G]] |volume=33 |issue= 1|pages=1–1232 |arxiv = astro-ph/0601168 |bibcode = 2006JPhG...33....1Y |doi=10.1088/0954-3899/33/1/001|display-authors=et al|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search continued at [[Fermilab]] in the United States, where the [[Tevatron]]—the collider that discovered the [[top quark]] in 1995—had been upgraded for this purpose. There was no guarantee that the Tevatron would be able to find the Higgs, but it was the only supercollider that was operational since the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) was still under construction and the planned [[Superconducting Super Collider]] had been cancelled in 1993 and never completed. The Tevatron was only able to exclude further ranges for the Higgs mass, and was shut down on 30 September 2011 because it no longer could keep up with the LHC. The final analysis of the data excluded the possibility of a Higgs boson with a mass between {{val|147|u=GeV/c2}} and {{val|180|u=GeV/c2}}. In addition, there was a small (but not significant) excess of events possibly indicating a Higgs boson with a mass between {{val|115|u=GeV/c2}} and {{val|140|u=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title=Updated Combination of CDF and D0 Searches for Standard Model Higgs Boson Production with up to {{val|10.0|u=fb-1}} of Data|author1=The CDF Collaboration |author2=The D0 Collaboration |author3=The Tevatron New Physics, Higgs Working Group |eprint=1207.0449 |class=hep-ex |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] in [[Switzerland]], was designed specifically to be able to either confirm or exclude the existence of the Higgs boson. Built in a 27&amp;nbsp;km tunnel under the ground near [[Geneva]] originally inhabited by LEP, it was designed to collide two beams of protons, initially at energies of {{val|3.5|u=TeV}} per beam (7&amp;nbsp;TeV total), or almost 3.6 times that of the Tevatron, and upgradeable to {{nowrap|2 × 7 TeV}} (14&amp;nbsp;TeV total) in future. Theory suggested if the Higgs boson existed, collisions at these energy levels should be able to reveal it. As one of the [[List of megaprojects#Science projects|most complicated scientific instruments]] ever built, its operational readiness was delayed for 14 months by a [[Magnet quench|magnet quench event]] nine days after its inaugural tests, caused by a faulty electrical connection that damaged over 50 superconducting magnets and contaminated the vacuum system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=15 October 2008|title=Interim Summary Report on the Analysis of the 19 September 2008 Incident at the LHC|url= https://edms.cern.ch/file/973073/1/Report_on_080919_incident_at_LHC__2_.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=CERN |id=EDMS&amp;nbsp;973073|accessdate=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=16 October 2008|title=CERN releases analysis of LHC incident|url=http://press.cern/press-releases/2008/10/cern-releases-analysis-lhc-incident |website=Media and Press relations |publisher=CERN |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CERNsummer"&gt;{{cite press release |date=5 December 2008|title=LHC to restart in 2009|url=http://press.cern/press-releases/2008/12/lhc-restart-2009 |website=Media and Press relations |publisher=CERN |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The new particle tested as a possible Higgs boson ====
Following the 2012 discovery, it was still unconfirmed whether or not the 125 GeV/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; particle was a Higgs boson. On one hand, observations remained consistent with the observed particle being the Standard Model Higgs boson, and the particle decayed into at least some of the predicted channels. Moreover, the production rates and branching ratios for the observed channels broadly matched the predictions by the Standard Model within the experimental uncertainties. However, the experimental uncertainties currently still left room for alternative explanations, meaning an announcement of the discovery of a Higgs boson would have been premature.&lt;ref name="PDGreview2012" /&gt; To allow more opportunity for data collection, the LHC's proposed 2012 shutdown and 2013–14 upgrade were postponed by 7 weeks into 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=LHC 2012 proton run extended by seven weeks |url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2012/30/News%20Articles/1462536?ln=en |first=James|last=Gillies|website=CERN Bulletin |issue=30 |date=23 July 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, in a conference in Kyoto researchers said evidence gathered since July was falling into line with the basic Standard Model more than its alternatives, with a range of results for several interactions matching that theory's predictions.&lt;ref name="BBC Nov 2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Higgs-boson-behaving-as-expected/tabid/1160/articleID/276802/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ| title= Higgs boson behaving as expected| date=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist Matt Strassler highlighted "considerable" evidence that the new particle is not a [[pseudoscalar]] [[Parity (physics)|negative parity]] particle (consistent with this required finding for a Higgs boson), "evaporation" or lack of increased significance for previous hints of non-Standard Model findings, expected Standard Model interactions with [[W and Z bosons]], absence of "significant new implications" for or against [[supersymmetry]], and in general no significant deviations to date from the results expected of a Standard Model Higgs boson.&lt;ref name="strassler nov 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Strassler|first=Matt|title=Higgs Results at Kyoto|url=http://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/14/higgs-results-at-kyoto/|website=Of Particular Significance: Conversations About Science with Theoretical Physicist Matt Strassler|publisher=Prof. Matt Strassler's personal particle physics website|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=2012-11-14|quote=ATLAS and CMS only just co-discovered this particle in July ...

These findings meant that as of January 2013, scientists were very sure they had found an unknown particle of mass ~ 125&amp;nbsp;GeV/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and had not been misled by experimental error or a chance result. They were also sure, from initial observations, that the new particle was some kind of boson. The behaviours and properties of the particle, so far as examined since July 2012, also seemed quite close to the behaviours expected of a Higgs boson. Even so, it could still have been a Higgs boson or some other unknown boson, since future tests could show behaviours that do not match a Higgs boson, so as of December 2012 CERN still only stated that the new particle was "consistent with" the Higgs boson,&lt;ref name="dieter July 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CERN Nov 2012" /&gt; and scientists did not yet positively say it was the Higgs boson.&lt;ref name=cern1207&gt;{{cite press release |website=Media and Press relations |url=http://press.cern/press-releases/2012/07/cern-experiments-observe-particle-consistent-long-sought-higgs-boson |title=CERN experiments observe particle consistent with long-sought Higgs boson |publisher=CERN |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, in late 2012, widespread media reports announced (incorrectly) that a Higgs boson had been confirmed during the year.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=Announced in articles in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://poy.time.com/2012/12/19/the-higgs-boson-particle-of-the-year/ | work=Time | title=Person Of The Year 2012 | date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forbes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/09/12/higgs-boson-discovery-has-been-confirmed/ |title=Higgs Boson Discovery Has Been Confirmed |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Slate Video Staff |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/trending/2012/09/11/higgs_boson_confirmed_cern_discovery_passes_test.html |title=Higgs Boson Confirmed; CERN Discovery Passes Test |publisher=Slate.com |date=2012-09-11 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[NPR]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/01/168208273/the-year-of-the-higgs-and-other-tiny-advances-in-science |title=The Year Of The Higgs, And Other Tiny Advances In Science |publisher=NPR |date=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/science/confirmed-the-higgs-boson-does-exist-20120704-21hac.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Confirmed: the Higgs boson does exist | date=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Confirmation of existence and current status ====

On 14 March 2013 CERN confirmed that:
:  "CMS and ATLAS have compared a number of options for the spin-parity of this particle, and these all prefer no spin and even parity [two fundamental criteria of a Higgs boson consistent with the Standard Model]. This, coupled with the measured interactions of the new particle with other particles, strongly indicates that it is a Higgs boson."&lt;ref name="CERN March 2013" /&gt;
This also makes the particle the first elementary [[scalar boson|scalar particle]] to be discovered in nature.&lt;ref name="WSJ 14 March 2013" /&gt;

==== Findings since 2013 ====
In July 2017, CERN confirmed that all measurements still agree with the predictions of the Standard Model, and called the discovered particle simply "the Higgs boson".&lt;ref name="CERN_EPS2017" /&gt; As of April 2018, the [[Large Hadron Collider]] has continued to produce findings that confirm the 2013 understanding of the Higgs field and particle.
 
The LHC's experimental work since restarting in 2015 has included probing the Higgs field and boson to a greater level of detail, and confirming whether or not less common predictions were correct. In particular, exploration since 2015 has provided strong evidence of the predicted direct decay into [[fermion]]s such as pairs of [[bottom quark]]s (3.6&amp;nbsp;σ)—described as an "important milestone" in understanding its short lifetime and other rare decays—and also to confirm decay into pairs of [[tau lepton]]s (5.9&amp;nbsp;σ). This was described  by CERN as being ''"of paramount importance to establishing the coupling of the Higgs boson to leptons and represents an important step towards measuring its couplings to third generation fermions, the very heavy copies of the electrons and quarks, whose role in nature is a profound mystery"''.&lt;ref name="CERN_EPS2017" /&gt;  Published results as of 19 Mar 2018 at 13&amp;nbsp;TeV for ATLAS and CMS had their measurements of the Higgs mass at {{val|124.98|0.28|u=GeV}} and {{val|125.26|0.21|u=GeV}} respectively.

In July 2018, the ATLAS and CMS experiments reported observing the Higgs boson decay into a pair of bottom quarks, which makes up approximately 60% of all of its decays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Long-sought decay of Higgs boson observed |date=28 Aug 2018 |url=https://home.cern/news/press-release/physics/long-sought-decay-higgs-boson-observed |website=Media and Press relations |publisher=CERN |access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ATLAS-20180828"&gt;{{cite press release |author=Atlas Collaboration |title=ATLAS observes elusive Higgs boson decay to a pair of bottom quarks |url=https://atlas.cern/updates/press-statement/observation-higgs-boson-decay-pair-bottom-quarks |date=August 28, 2018 |website=Atlas |publisher=CERN |accessdate=August 28, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CMS Collaboration |date=August 2018 |url=http://cms.cern/higgs-observed-decaying-b-quarks |title=Observation of Higgs boson decay to bottom quarks |website=CMS |access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |author=CMS Collaboration |date=24 Aug 2018 |url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/2636067 |title=Observation of Higgs boson decay to bottom quarks |website=CERN Document Server |publisher=CERN |access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Cite journal |author=CMS Collaboration |date=24 Aug 2018 |title=Observation of Higgs boson decay to bottom quarks |journal= Physical Review Letters|volume=121 |issue=12 |pages=121801 |arxiv=1808.08242 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.121801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spontaneous symmetry breaking (explanatory diagram).png|thumb|upright=1.25|"[[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|Symmetry breaking]] illustrated": – At high energy levels ''(left)'' the ball settles in the centre, and the result is symmetrical. At lower energy levels ''(right)'', the overall "rules" remain symmetrical, but the "Mexican hat" potential comes into effect: [[local property|"local" symmetry]] inevitably becomes broken since eventually the ball must at random roll one way or another.]]
[[Gauge invariance]] is an important property of modern particle theories such as the [[Standard Model]], partly due to its success in other areas of fundamental physics such as [[electromagnetism]] and the [[strong interaction]] ([[quantum chromodynamics]]). However, there were{{when|date=August 2016}} great difficulties in developing gauge theories for the [[weak nuclear force]] or a possible unified [[electroweak interaction]]. [[Fermion]]s with a mass term would violate gauge symmetry and therefore cannot be gauge invariant. (This can be seen by examining the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Dirac Lagrangian]] for a fermion in terms of left and right handed components; we find none of the spin-half particles could ever flip [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] as required for mass, so they must be massless.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In the Standard Model, the mass term arising from the Dirac Lagrangian for any fermion &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-m\bar{\psi}\psi&lt;/math&gt;. This is ''not'' invariant under the electroweak symmetry, as can be seen by writing &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; in terms of left and right handed components:
:&lt;math&gt;-m\bar{\psi}\psi\;=\;-m(\bar{\psi}_L\psi_R+\bar{\psi}_R\psi_L)&lt;/math&gt;
i.e., contributions from &lt;math&gt;\bar{\psi}_L\psi_L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\psi}_R\psi_R&lt;/math&gt; terms do not appear. We see that the mass-generating interaction is achieved by constant flipping of particle [[chirality]]. Since the spin-half particles have no right/left helicity pair with the same [[SU(2)]] and [[SU(3)]] representation and the same weak hypercharge, then assuming these gauge charges are conserved in the vacuum, none of the spin-half particles could ever swap helicity. Therefore, in the absence of some other cause, all fermions must be massless.&lt;/ref&gt;) [[W and Z bosons]] are observed to have mass, but a boson mass term contains terms which clearly depend on the choice of gauge, and therefore these masses too cannot be gauge invariant. Therefore, it seems that ''none'' of the standard model fermions ''or'' bosons could "begin" with mass as an inbuilt property except by abandoning gauge invariance. If gauge invariance were to be retained, then these particles had to be acquiring their mass by some other mechanism or interaction. Additionally, whatever was giving these particles their mass had to not "break" gauge invariance as the basis for other parts of the theories where it worked well, ''and'' had to not require or predict unexpected massless particles or long-range forces (seemingly an inevitable consequence of [[Goldstone's theorem]]) which did not actually seem to exist in nature.

A solution to all of these overlapping problems came from the discovery of a previously unnoticed borderline case hidden in the mathematics of Goldstone's theorem,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="GoldstoneNote"&gt;[[Goldstone's theorem]] only applies to gauges having [[Lorentz covariance|manifest Lorentz covariance]], a condition that took time to become questioned. But the process of [[quantization (physics)|quantisation]]&lt;!--BRITISH ENGLISH SPELLING--&gt; requires a [[gauge fixing|gauge to be fixed]] and at this point it becomes possible to choose a gauge such as the 'radiation' gauge which is not invariant over time, so that these problems can be avoided. According to {{harvp|Bernstein |1974|p=8}}:
: "the "radiation gauge" condition {{nowrap|1=∇⋅A(''x'') = 0}} is clearly noncovariant, which means that if we wish to maintain transversality of the photon in all [[Lorentz frame]]s, the [[photon field]] A&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') cannot transform like a [[four-vector]]. This is no catastrophe, since the photon ''field'' is not an [[observable]], and one can readily show that the S-matrix elements, which ''are'' observable have covariant structures .... in gauge theories one might arrange things so that one had a symmetry breakdown because of the noninvariance of the vacuum; but, because the Goldstone ''et al.'' proof breaks down, the zero mass Goldstone mesons need not appear." [Emphasis in original]
{{harvp|Bernstein |1974}} contains an accessible and comprehensive background and review of this area, see [[#external links|external links]]&lt;/ref&gt; that under certain conditions it ''might'' theoretically be possible for a symmetry to be broken ''without'' disrupting gauge invariance and ''without'' any new massless particles or forces, and having "sensible" ([[renormalization|renormalisable]]) results mathematically. This became known as the [[Higgs mechanism]].

[[File:Elementary particle interactions.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|Summary of interactions between certain [[elementary particle|particles]] described by the [[Standard Model]].]]
The Standard Model hypothesises a [[Quantum field theory|field]] which is responsible for this effect, called the Higgs field (symbol: &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), which has the unusual property of a non-zero amplitude in its [[ground state]]; i.e., a non-zero [[vacuum expectation value]]. It can have this effect because of its unusual "Mexican hat" shaped potential whose lowest "point" is not at its "centre". In simple terms, unlike all other known fields, the Higgs field requires ''less'' energy to have a non-zero value than a zero value, so it ends up having a non-zero value ''everywhere''. Below a certain extremely high energy level the existence of this non-zero vacuum expectation [[symmetry breaking|spontaneously breaks]] [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] [[Introduction to gauge theory|gauge symmetry]] which in turn gives rise to the Higgs mechanism and triggers the acquisition of mass by those particles interacting with the field. This effect occurs because [[scalar field]] components of the Higgs field are "absorbed" by the massive bosons as [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], and couple to the fermions via [[Yukawa coupling]], thereby producing the expected mass terms. When symmetry breaks under these conditions, the [[Goldstone boson]]s that arise ''interact'' with the Higgs field (and with other particles capable of interacting with the Higgs field) instead of becoming new massless particles. The intractable problems of both underlying theories "neutralise" each other, and the residual outcome is that elementary particles acquire a consistent mass based on how strongly they interact with the Higgs field. It is the simplest known process capable of giving mass to the [[gauge boson]]s while remaining compatible with [[gauge theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peskin|Schroeder|1995|pp=717–719, 787–791}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its [[quantum]] would be a [[scalar boson|scalar]] [[boson]], known as the Higgs boson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peskin|Schroeder|1995|pp=715–716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Properties of the Higgs field ===
In the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a [[scalar field|scalar]] [[tachyonic field|tachyonic]] field – ''scalar'' meaning it does not transform under [[Lorentz transformation]]s, and ''tachyonic'' meaning the field (but '''not''' the particle) has [[imaginary mass]], and in certain configurations must undergo [[symmetry breaking]]. It consists of four components: two neutral ones and two charged component [[field (physics)|fields]]. Both of the charged components and one of the neutral fields are [[Goldstone boson]]s, which act as the longitudinal third-polarisation components of the massive [[W and Z bosons|W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, W&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and Z bosons]]. The quantum of the remaining neutral component corresponds to (and is theoretically realised as) the massive Higgs boson,&lt;ref name=Gunion1&gt;{{cite book

It is also possible, although experimentally difficult, to estimate the mass of the Higgs boson indirectly. In the Standard Model, the Higgs boson has a number of indirect effects; most notably, Higgs loops result in tiny corrections to masses of W and Z bosons. Precision measurements of electroweak parameters, such as the [[Fermi's interaction|Fermi constant]] and masses of W/Z bosons, can be used to calculate constraints on the mass of the Higgs. As of July 2011, the precision electroweak measurements tell us that the mass of the Higgs boson is likely to be less than about {{val|161|u=GeV/c2}} at 95% [[confidence level]] (this upper limit would increase to {{val|185|u=GeV/c2}} if the lower bound of {{val|114.4|u=GeV/c2}} from the LEP-2 direct search is allowed for&lt;ref name="EWWG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lepewwg.web.cern.ch/LEPEWWG/ |title=LEP Electroweak Working Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;). These indirect constraints rely on the assumption that the Standard Model is correct. It may still be possible to discover a Higgs boson above these masses if it is accompanied by other particles beyond those predicted by the Standard Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

If Higgs particle theories are valid, then a Higgs particle can be produced much like other particles that are studied, in a [[particle collider]]. This involves accelerating a large number of particles to extremely high energies and extremely close to the [[speed of light]], then allowing them to smash together. [[Proton]]s and [[lead]] [[ion]]s (the bare [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of lead [[atom]]s) are used at the LHC. In the extreme energies of these collisions, the desired esoteric particles will occasionally be produced and this can be detected and studied; any absence or difference from theoretical expectations can also be used to improve the theory. The relevant particle theory (in this case the Standard Model) will determine the necessary kinds of collisions and detectors. The Standard Model predicts that Higgs bosons could be formed in a number of ways,&lt;ref name="HprodLHC"&gt;{{cite journal

|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the probability of producing a Higgs boson in any collision is always expected to be very small—for example, only 1 Higgs boson per 10 billion collisions in the Large Hadron Collider.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name="production_rate"}} The most common expected processes for Higgs boson production are:
* ''Gluon fusion''. If the collided particles are [[hadron]]s such as the [[proton]] or [[antiproton]]—as is the case in the LHC and Tevatron—then it is most likely that two of the [[gluon]]s binding the hadron together collide. The easiest way to produce a Higgs particle is if the two gluons combine to form a loop of [[virtual particle|virtual]] quarks. Since the coupling of particles to the Higgs boson is proportional to their mass, this process is more likely for heavy particles. In practice it is enough to consider the contributions of virtual [[top quark|top]] and [[bottom quark|bottom]] quarks (the heaviest quarks). This process is the dominant contribution at the LHC and Tevatron being about ten times more likely than any of the other processes.&lt;ref name="HprodLHC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HprodTeva" /&gt;
* ''Higgs Strahlung''. If an elementary [[fermion]] collides with an anti-fermion—e.g., a quark with an anti-quark or an [[electron]] with a [[positron]]—the two can merge to form a virtual W or Z boson which, if it carries sufficient energy, can then emit a Higgs boson. This process was the dominant production mode at the LEP, where an electron and a positron collided to form a virtual Z boson, and it was the second largest contribution for Higgs production at the Tevatron. At the LHC this process is only the third largest, because the LHC collides protons with protons, making a quark-antiquark collision less likely than at the Tevatron. Higgs Strahlung is also known as ''associated production''.&lt;ref name="HprodLHC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HprodTeva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HprodLEP" /&gt;
* ''Weak boson fusion''. Another possibility when two (anti-)fermions collide is that the two exchange a virtual W or Z boson, which emits a Higgs boson. The colliding fermions do not need to be the same type. So, for example, an [[up quark]] may exchange a Z boson with an anti-down quark. This process is the second most important for the production of Higgs particle at the LHC and LEP.&lt;ref name="HprodLHC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HprodLEP" /&gt;
* ''Top fusion''. The final process that is commonly considered is by far the least likely (by two orders of magnitude). This process involves two colliding gluons, which each decay into a heavy quark–antiquark pair. A quark and antiquark from each pair can then combine to form a Higgs particle.&lt;ref name="HprodLHC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HprodTeva" /&gt;

=== Decay ===
[[File:Higgsdecaywidth.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Standard Model prediction for the [[decay width]] of the Higgs particle depends on the value of its mass.]]
Quantum mechanics predicts that if it is possible for a particle to decay into a set of lighter particles, then it will eventually do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2012/jun/22/higgs-boson-particlephysics |title=Why does the Higgs decay? |first=Lily |last=Asquith |work=Life and Physics |publisher=The Guardian |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true for the Higgs boson. The likelihood with which this happens depends on a variety of factors including: the difference in mass, the strength of the interactions, etc. Most of these factors are fixed by the Standard Model, except for the mass of the Higgs boson itself. For a Higgs boson with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}} the SM predicts a mean life time of about {{val|1.6|e=-22|u=s}}.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name="meanlife"}}

[[File:HiggsBR.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Standard Model prediction for the [[branching ratio]]s of the different decay modes of the Higgs particle depends on the value of its mass.]]
Since it interacts with all the massive elementary particles of the SM, the Higgs boson has many different processes through which it can decay. Each of these possible processes has its own probability, expressed as the ''branching ratio''; the fraction of the total number decays that follows that process. The SM predicts these branching ratios as a function of the Higgs mass (see plot).

One way that the Higgs can decay is by splitting into a fermion–antifermion pair. As general rule, the Higgs is more likely to decay into heavy fermions than light fermions, because the mass of a fermion is proportional to the strength of its interaction with the Higgs.&lt;ref name="PDGreview2012"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this logic the most common decay should be into a [[top quark|top]]–antitop quark pair. However, such a decay would only be possible if the Higgs were heavier than ~{{val|346|u=GeV/c2}}, twice the mass of the top quark. For a Higgs mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}} the SM predicts that the most common decay is into a [[bottom quark|bottom]]–antibottom quark pair, which happens 57.7% of the time.&lt;ref name="LHCcrosssections" /&gt; The second most common fermion decay at that mass is a [[tau particle|tau]]–antitau pair, which happens only about 6.3% of the time.&lt;ref name="LHCcrosssections" /&gt;

Another possibility is for the Higgs to split into a pair of massive gauge bosons. The most likely possibility is for the Higgs to decay into a pair of W bosons (the light blue line in the plot), which happens about 21.5% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="LHCcrosssections" /&gt; The W bosons can subsequently decay either into a quark and an antiquark or into a charged lepton and a neutrino. The decays of W bosons into quarks are difficult to distinguish from the background, and the decays into leptons cannot be fully reconstructed (because neutrinos are impossible to detect in particle collision experiments). A cleaner signal is given by decay into a pair of Z-bosons (which happens about 2.6% of the time for a Higgs with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}),&lt;ref name="LHCcrosssections" /&gt; if each of the bosons subsequently decays into a pair of easy-to-detect charged leptons ([[electron]]s or [[muon]]s).

Decay into massless gauge bosons (i.e., [[gluon]]s or [[photon]]s) is also possible, but requires intermediate loop of virtual heavy quarks (top or bottom) or massive gauge bosons.&lt;ref name="PDGreview2012" /&gt; The most common such process is the decay into a pair of gluons through a loop of virtual heavy quarks. This process, which is the reverse of the gluon fusion process mentioned above, happens approximately 8.6% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="LHCcrosssections" /&gt; Much rarer is the decay into a pair of photons mediated by a loop of W bosons or heavy quarks, which happens only twice for every thousand decays.&lt;ref name="LHCcrosssections" /&gt; However, this process is very relevant for experimental searches for the Higgs boson, because the energy and momentum of the photons can be measured very precisely, giving an accurate reconstruction of the mass of the decaying particle.&lt;ref name="PDGreview2012" /&gt;

=== Alternative models ===
{{Main|Alternatives to the Standard Model Higgs}}

The Minimal Standard Model as described above is the simplest known model for the Higgs mechanism with just one Higgs field. However, an extended Higgs sector with additional Higgs particle doublets or triplets is also possible, and many extensions of the Standard Model have this feature. The non-minimal Higgs sector favoured by theory are the [[Two-Higgs-Doublet Model|two-Higgs-doublet models]] (2HDM), which predict the existence of a [[quintet]] of scalar particles: two [[CP violation|CP-even]] neutral Higgs bosons h&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, a CP-odd neutral Higgs boson A&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, and two charged Higgs particles H&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Supersymmetry]] ("SUSY") also predicts relations between the Higgs-boson masses and the masses of the gauge bosons, and could accommodate a {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}} neutral Higgs boson.

The key method to distinguish between these different models involves study of the particles' interactions ("coupling") and exact decay processes ("branching ratios"), which can be measured and tested experimentally in particle collisions. In the Type-I 2HDM model one Higgs doublet couples to up and down quarks, while the second doublet does not couple to quarks. This model has two interesting limits, in which the lightest Higgs couples to just fermions ("gauge-[[phobia|phobic]]") or just gauge bosons ("fermiophobic"), but not both. In the Type-II 2HDM model, one Higgs doublet only couples to up-type quarks, the other only couples to down-type quarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In other models the Higgs scalar is a composite particle. For example, in [[Technicolor (physics)|technicolor]] the role of the Higgs field is played by strongly bound pairs of fermions called [[techniquark]]s.

=== Further theoretical issues and hierarchy problem ===
{{Main|Hierarchy problem|Hierarchy problem#The Higgs mass}}
[[File:One-loop-diagram.svg|thumb|A one-loop [[Feynman diagram]] of the first-order correction to the Higgs mass. In the Standard Model the effects of these corrections are potentially enormous, giving rise to the so-called [[hierarchy problem]].]]
The Standard Model leaves the mass of the Higgs boson as a [[parameter]] to be measured, rather than a value to be calculated. This is seen as theoretically unsatisfactory, particularly as quantum corrections (related to interactions with [[virtual particle]]s) should apparently cause the Higgs particle to have a mass immensely higher than that observed, but at the same time the Standard Model requires a mass [[order of magnitude|of the order of]] 100 to 1000 GeV to ensure [[unitarity]] (in this case, to unitarise longitudinal vector boson scattering).&lt;ref name="Hierarchy problem Quantum Diaries"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hierarchy Problem: why the Higgs has a snowball's chance in hell|url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2012/07/01/the-hierarchy-problem-why-the-higgs-has-a-snowballs-chance-in-hell/|publisher=Quantum Diaries|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reconciling these points appears to require explaining why there is an almost-perfect cancellation resulting in the visible mass of ~ 125 GeV, and it is not clear how to do this. Because the weak force is about 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; times stronger than gravity, and (linked to this) the Higgs boson's mass is so much less than the [[Planck mass]] or the [[grand unification energy]], it appears that either there is some underlying connection or reason for these observations which is unknown and not described by the Standard Model, or some unexplained and extremely precise [[fine-tuning]] of parameters – however at present neither of these explanations is proven. This is known as a [[hierarchy problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/ |title=The Hierarchy Problem &amp;#124; Of Particular Significance |publisher=Profmattstrassler.com |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, the hierarchy problem amounts to the worry that [[physics beyond the standard model|a future theory of fundamental particles and interactions]] should not have excessive fine-tunings or unduly delicate cancellations, and should allow masses of particles such as the Higgs boson to be calculable. The problem is in some ways unique to spin-0 particles (such as the Higgs boson), which can give rise to issues related to quantum corrections that do not affect particles with spin.&lt;ref name="Hierarchy problem Quantum Diaries" /&gt; A [[Hierarchy problem#Theoretical solutions|number of solutions have been proposed]], including [[supersymmetry]], conformal solutions and solutions via extra dimensions such as [[braneworld]] models.

There are also issues of [[quantum triviality]], which suggests that it may not be possible to create a consistent quantum field theory involving elementary scalar particles.&lt;ref name="TrivPurs"&gt;

A considerable amount has been written on how Higgs' name came to be exclusively used. Two main explanations are offered.  The first is that Higgs undertook a step which was either unique, clearer or more explicit in his paper in formally predicting and examining the particle.  Of the PRL papers' authors, only the paper by Higgs ''explicitly'' offered as a prediction that a massive particle would exist and calculated some of its properties;&lt;ref name="frank_close_infinity_puzzle" /&gt;{{rp|167}}&lt;ref name="CERNHiggsFAQ"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2012/28/News%20Articles/1459456?ln=en|title=Frequently Asked Questions: The Higgs!|website=CERN Bulletin |issue=28 |accessdate= 18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was therefore "the first to postulate the existence of a massive particle" according to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref name="Nature-Higgs name" /&gt; Physicist and author [[Frank Close]] and physicist-blogger [[Peter Woit]] both comment that the paper by GHK was also completed after Higgs and Brout–Englert were submitted to [[Physical Review Letters]].&lt;ref name="frank_close_infinity_puzzle" /&gt;{{rp|167}}&lt;ref name="woit2013"&gt;[http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=5753 Woit's physics blog ''"Not Even Wrong"'': Anderson on Anderson-Higgs] 2013-04-13&lt;/ref&gt; and that Higgs alone had drawn attention to a predicted massive ''scalar'' boson, while all others had focused on the massive ''vector'' bosons;&lt;ref name="frank_close_infinity_puzzle" /&gt;{{rp|154, 166, 175}}&lt;ref name="woit2013" /&gt; In this way, Higgs' contribution also provided experimentalists with a crucial "concrete target" needed to test the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sample|first=Ian|title=Higgs boson's many great minds cause a Nobel prize headache|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-nobel-prize-headache|accessdate=23 July 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2012-07-04|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Higgs' view, Brout and Englert did not explicitly mention the boson since its existence is plainly obvious in their work,&lt;ref name="MyLifeAsABoson" /&gt;{{rp|6}} while according to Guralnik the GHK paper was a complete analysis of the entire symmetry breaking mechanism whose [[mathematical rigour]] is absent from the other two papers, and a massive particle may exist in some solutions.&lt;ref name="Guralnik 2009" /&gt;{{rp|9}} Higgs' paper also provided an "especially sharp" statement of the challenge and its solution according to [[history of science|science historian]] David Kaiser.&lt;ref name="Nova" /&gt;

The alternative explanation is that the name was popularised in the 1970s due to its use as a convenient shorthand or because of a mistake in citing.  Many accounts (including Higgs' own&lt;ref name="MyLifeAsABoson" /&gt;{{rp|7}}) credit the "Higgs" name to physicist [[Benjamin W. Lee|Benjamin Lee]] (in {{lang-ko|Lee Whi-soh}}).

|quote=Consider the early universe–a state of pure, perfect nothingness; a formless fog of undifferentiated stuff ... 'perfect symmetry' ... What shattered this primordial perfection? One likely culprit is the so-called Higgs field ... Physicist Leon Lederman compares the way the Higgs operates to the biblical story of Babel [whose citizens] all spoke the same language ... Like God, says Lederman, the Higgs differentiated the perfect sameness, confusing everyone (physicists included) ... [Nobel Prizewinner Richard] [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] wondered why the universe we live in was so obviously askew ... Perhaps, he speculated, total perfection would have been unacceptable to God. And so, just as God shattered the perfection of Babel, 'God made the laws only nearly symmetrical'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Today ... we have the standard model, which reduces all of reality to a dozen or so particles and four forces. ... It's a hard-won simplicity [...and...] remarkably accurate. But it is also incomplete and, in fact, internally inconsistent... This boson is so central to the state of physics today, so crucial to our final understanding of the structure of matter, yet so elusive, that I have given it a nickname: the God Particle. Why God Particle? Two reasons. One, the publisher wouldn't let us call it the Goddamn Particle, though that might be a more appropriate title, given its villainous nature and the expense it is causing. And two, there is a connection, of sorts, to [[Book of Genesis|another book]], a ''much'' older one...|Leon M. Lederman and Dick Teresi|''The God Particle: If the Universe is the Answer, What is the Question''&lt;ref name="L&amp;T" /&gt; p. 22}}

Lederman asks whether the Higgs boson was added just to perplex and confound those seeking knowledge of the universe, and whether physicists will be confounded by it as recounted in that story, or ultimately surmount the challenge and understand "how beautiful is the universe [God has] made".&lt;ref&gt;Lederman, p.&amp;nbsp;22 ''et seq'':
: "Something we cannot yet detect and which, one might say, has been put there to test and confuse us ... The issue is whether physicists will be confounded by this puzzle or whether, in contrast to the unhappy Babylonians, we will continue to build the tower and, as Einstein put it, 'know the mind of God'."
: "And the Lord said, Behold the people are un-confounding my confounding. And the Lord sighed and said, Go to, let us go down, and there give them the God Particle so that they may see how beautiful is the universe I have made".&lt;/ref&gt;

An educational collaboration involving an LHC physicist and a [http://teachers.web.cern.ch/teachers/ High School Teachers at CERN] educator suggests that [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion of light]] – responsible for the [[rainbow]] and [[dispersive prism]] – is a useful analogy for the Higgs field's symmetry breaking and mass-causing effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Higgs particle: an analogy for Physics classroom (section)|url=http://www.lhc-closer.es/php/index.php?i=1&amp;s=6&amp;p=5&amp;e=0|publisher=www.lhc-closer.es (a collaboration website of LHCb physicist Xabier Vidal and High School Teachers at CERN educator Ramon Manzano)|accessdate=2013-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Strassler uses electric fields as an analogy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flam|first=Faye|authorlink=Faye Flam|title=Finally – A Higgs Boson Story Anyone Can Understand|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/Finally---A-Higgs-Boson-Story-Anyone-Can-Understand.html|accessdate=21 January 2013|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] (philly.com)|date=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Some particles interact with the Higgs field while others don’t. Those particles that feel the Higgs field act as if they have mass. Something similar happens in an [[electric field]] – charged objects are pulled around and neutral objects can sail through unaffected. So you can think of the Higgs search as an attempt to make waves in the Higgs field [''create Higgs bosons''] to prove it’s really there.}}

A similar explanation was offered by ''[[The Guardian]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sample|first=Ian|title=How will we know when the Higgs particle has been detected?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/apr/28/higgs-boson-rumour-cern-lhc|accessdate=21 January 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2011-04-28|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Higgs boson is essentially a ripple in a field said to have emerged at the birth of the universe and to span the cosmos to this day ... The particle is crucial however: It is the [[smoking gun]], the evidence required to show the theory is right.}}

The Higgs field's effect on particles was famously described by physicist David Miller as akin to a room full of political party workers spread evenly throughout a room: the crowd gravitates to and slows down famous people but does not slow down others.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=In Miller's analogy, the Higgs field is compared to political party workers spread evenly throughout a room. There will be some people (in Miller's example an anonymous person) who pass through the crowd with ease, paralleling the interaction between the field and particles that do not interact with it, such as massless photons. There will be other people (in Miller's example the British prime minister) who would find their progress being continually slowed by the swarm of admirers crowding around, paralleling the interaction for particles that do interact with the field and by doing so, acquire a finite mass.&lt;ref name="Miller analogy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kathryn Jepsen |date=2012-03-01 |title=Ten things you may not know about the Higgs boson |url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000921 |website = Symmetry Magazine |accessdate = 10 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He also drew attention to well-known effects in [[solid state physics]] where an electron's effective mass can be much greater than usual in the presence of a crystal lattice.&lt;ref name="Miller analogy"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/~djm/higgsa.html | title = A quasi-political Explanation of the Higgs Boson; for Mr Waldegrave, UK Science Minister 1993 | first = David | last = Miller | accessdate = 10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analogies based on [[Drag (physics)|drag]] effects, including analogies of "[[syrup]]" or "[[molasses]]" are also well known, but can be somewhat misleading since they may be understood (incorrectly) as saying that the Higgs field simply resists some particles' motion but not others' – a simple resistive effect could also conflict with [[Newton's third law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldberg |first=David |title=What's the Matter with the Higgs Boson?|url=http://io9.com/5690248/whats-the-matter-with-the-higgs-boson |website=io9 |accessdate=21 January 2013 |date=2010-11-17 |dead-url=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121045610/http://io9.com/5690248/whats-the-matter-with-the-higgs-boson |archive-date=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recognition and awards ===
There was considerable discussion prior to late 2013 of how to allocate the credit if the Higgs boson is proven, made more pointed as a [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel prize]] had been expected, and the very wide basis of people entitled to consideration. These include a range of theoreticians who made the Higgs mechanism theory possible, the theoreticians of the 1964 PRL papers (including Higgs himself), the theoreticians who derived from these a working electroweak theory and the Standard Model itself, and also the experimentalists at CERN and other institutions who made possible the proof of the Higgs field and boson in reality. The Nobel prize has a limit of 3 persons to share an award, and some possible winners are already prize holders for other work, or are deceased (the prize is only awarded to persons in their lifetime). Existing prizes for works relating to the Higgs field, boson, or mechanism include:
* Nobel Prize in Physics (1979) – [[Sheldon Lee Glashow|Glashow]], [[Abdus Salam|Salam]], and [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg]], ''for contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979 The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979] – official Nobel Prize website.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nobel Prize in Physics (1999) – [[Gerard 't Hooft|'t Hooft]] and [[Tini Veltman|Veltman]], ''for elucidating the quantum structure of electroweak interactions in physics''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1999 The Nobel Prize in Physics 1999] – official Nobel Prize website.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sakurai Prize|J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics]] (2010) – Hagen, Englert, Guralnik, Higgs, Brout, and Kibble, ''for elucidation of the properties of spontaneous symmetry breaking in four-dimensional relativistic gauge theory and of the mechanism for the consistent generation of vector boson masses''&lt;ref name="sakuraiprize" /&gt; (for the 1964 papers described [[#History|above]])
* [[Wolf Prize]] (2004) – Englert, Brout, and Higgs
* Nobel Prize in Physics (2013) – [[Peter Higgs]] and [[François Englert]], ''for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2013/ 2013 Physics] – official Nobel Prize website.&lt;/ref&gt; Englert's co-researcher [[Robert Brout]] had died in 2011 and the Nobel Prize is [[Nobel Prize#Posthumous nominations|not ordinarily given posthumously]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Additionally [[Physical Review Letters]]' 50-year review (2008) recognised the [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers]] and Weinberg's 1967 paper ''A model of Leptons'' (the most cited paper in particle physics, as of 2012) "milestone Letters".&lt;ref name="PRL_50years" /&gt;

Following reported observation of the Higgs-like particle in July 2012, several [[Indian media]] outlets reported on the supposed neglect of credit to [[Indian people|Indian]] physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] after whose work in the 1920s the class of particles "[[bosons]]" is named&lt;ref name="AP-20120710"&gt;{{cite news |last=Daigle |first=Katy |title=India: Enough about Higgs, let's discuss the boson |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20120710/D9VU1DRG0.html |date=10 July 2012 |newspaper=[[AP News]] |accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20120919"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bal |first=Hartosh Singh |title=The Bose in the Boson |url=http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/indians-clamor-for-credit-for-the-bose-in-boson/ |date=19 September 2012 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=21 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (although physicists have described Bose's connection to the discovery as tenuous).&lt;ref name="outlook-in-bose"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alikhan|first=Anvar|title=The Spark In A Crowded Field|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?281539|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper=Outlook India|date=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical aspects and mathematical formulation ==
{{See also|Standard Model (mathematical formulation)}}
In the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a four-component scalar field that forms a complex [[doublet (physics)|doublet]] of the [[weak isospin]] [[SU(2)]] symmetry:
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\phi=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\phi^1 + i\phi^2 \\ \phi^0+i\phi^3
\end{array}
\right)\;,
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
while the field has charge +½ under the [[weak hypercharge]] [[U(1)]] symmetry.&lt;ref name="PeskinSchroederHiggs" /&gt;

The Higgs part of the Lagrangian is&lt;ref name="PeskinSchroederHiggs" /&gt;
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_H = \left|\left(\partial_\mu -i g W_\mu^a \tau^a -i\frac{1}{2} g' B_\mu\right)\phi\right|^2 + \mu^2 \phi^\dagger\phi-\lambda (\phi^\dagger\phi)^2,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;W_\mu^a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_\mu&lt;/math&gt; are the [[gauge boson]]s of the SU(2) and U(1) symmetries, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g'&lt;/math&gt; their respective [[coupling constant]]s, &lt;math&gt;\tau^a=\frac{1}{2}\sigma^a&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\sigma^a&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Pauli matrices]]) a complete set generators of the SU(2) symmetry, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu^{2}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, so that the [[ground state]] breaks the SU(2) symmetry (see figure). The ground state of the Higgs field (the bottom of the potential) is degenerate with different ground states related to each other by a SU(2) gauge transformation. It is always possible to [[unitarity gauge|pick a gauge]] such that in the ground state &lt;math&gt;\phi^1=\phi^2=\phi^3=0&lt;/math&gt;. The expectation value of &lt;math&gt;\phi^0&lt;/math&gt; in the ground state (the [[vacuum expectation value]] or VEV) is then &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi^0\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt 2\ }v&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;v = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt \lambda \ } \left|\mu\right|&lt;/math&gt;. The measured value of this parameter is ~{{val|246|u=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="PDGreview2012" /&gt; It has units of mass, and is the only free parameter of the Standard Model that is not a dimensionless number. Quadratic terms in &lt;math&gt;W_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; arise, which give masses to the ''W'' and ''Z'' bosons:&lt;ref name="PeskinSchroederHiggs"&gt;{{harvnb|Peskin|Schroeder|1995|loc=Chapter 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;m_W = \tfrac{1}{2}v \left| g \right|,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;m_Z=\tfrac{1}{2}v\sqrt{ g^2 + {g'}^2 },&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
with their ratio determining the [[Weinberg angle]], &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta_W = \frac{m_W}{m_Z} = \frac{|g|}{\sqrt{g^2+{g'}^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, and leave a massless U(1) [[photon]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. The mass of the Higgs boson itself is given by
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;m_H= \sqrt{2 \mu^2 } \equiv \sqrt{ 2 \lambda v^2 }.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

The quarks and the leptons interact with the Higgs field through [[Yukawa interaction]] terms:
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\mathcal{L}_{Y} =
&amp;-\lambda_u^{ij}\frac{\phi^0-i\phi^3}{\sqrt{2}}\overline u_L^i  u_R^j
+\lambda_u^{ij}\frac{\phi^1-i\phi^2}{\sqrt{2}}\overline d_L^i  u_R^j\\
&amp;-\lambda_d^{ij}\frac{\phi^0+i\phi^3}{\sqrt{2}}\overline d_L^i  d_R^j
-\lambda_d^{ij}\frac{\phi^1+i\phi^2}{\sqrt{2}}\overline u_L^i  d_R^j\\
&amp;-\lambda_e^{ij}\frac{\phi^0+i\phi^3}{\sqrt{2}}\overline e_L^i  e_R^j
-\lambda_e^{ij}\frac{\phi^1+i\phi^2}{\sqrt{2}}\overline \nu_L^i  e_R^j
+ \textrm{h.c.},\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;(d,u,e,\nu)_{L,R}^i&lt;/math&gt; are left-handed and right-handed quarks and leptons of the ''i''th [[generation (physics)|generation]], &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{u,d,e}^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are matrices of Yukawa couplings where [[+ h.c.|h.c.]] denotes the hermitian conjugate of all the preceding terms. In the symmetry breaking ground state, only the terms containing &lt;math&gt;\phi^0&lt;/math&gt; remain, giving rise to mass terms for the fermions. Rotating the quark and lepton fields to the basis where the matrices of Yukawa couplings are diagonal, one gets
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{m} = -m_u^i \overline u_L^i  u_R^i -m_d^i\overline d_L^i  d_R^i -m_e^i\overline e_L^i  e_R^i+ \textrm{h.c.},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}
where the masses of the fermions are &lt;math&gt; m_{u,d,e}^i = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt 2\ }\lambda_{u,d,e}^i v&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \lambda_{u,d,e}^i &lt;/math&gt; denote the eigenvalues of the Yukawa matrices.&lt;ref name="PeskinSchroederHiggs" /&gt;

[[File:High Pressure.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Satellite image of an unusual high-pressure area south of Australia, evidenced by the clearing in the clouds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=78208|title=An Australian "Anti-storm"|date=2012-06-08|accessdate=2013-02-12|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''high-pressure area''', '''high''' or '''anticyclone''' is a region where the [[atmospheric pressure]] at the surface of the planet is greater than its surrounding environment.

Winds within high-pressure areas flow outward from the higher pressure areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers. Gravity adds to the forces causing this general movement, because the higher pressure compresses the column of air near the center of the area into greater density – and so greater weight compared to lower pressure, lower density, and lower weight of the air outside the center.

However, because the planet is rotating underneath the atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the [[Coriolis effect]], or the merely apparent [[force]] that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference. Viewed from above this twist in wind direction is in the same direction as the rotation of the planet.

The strongest high-pressure areas are associated with cold air masses which push away out of polar regions during the winter when there is less sun to warm neighboring regions. These Highs change character and weaken once they move further over relatively warmer water bodies.

Somewhat weaker but more common are high-pressure areas caused by atmospheric subsidence, that is, areas where large masses of cooler drier air descend from an elevation of 8 to 15&amp;nbsp;km after the lower temperatures have precipitated out the water vapor.

Many of the features of Highs may be understood in context of middle- or [[Mesoscale meteorology|meso-scale]] and relatively enduring dynamics of a planet's [[atmospheric circulation]]. For example, massive atmospheric subsidences occur as part of the descending branches of [[Ferrel cell]]s and [[Hadley cell]]s. Hadley cells help form the [[subtropical ridge]], steer [[tropical wave]]s and [[tropical cyclone]]s across the ocean and is strongest during the summer.  The subtropical ridge also helps form most of the world's [[desert]]s.

On [[English language|English-language]] [[weather map]]s, high-pressure centers are identified by the letter H.  Weather maps in other languages may use different letters or symbols.

==Wind circulation in the northern and southern hemispheres==
The direction of wind flow around an atmospheric high-pressure area and a [[low-pressure area]], as seen from above,  depends on the hemisphere. High-pressure systems rotate clockwise in the northern Hemisphere; low-pressure systems rotate clockwise in the southern hemisphere.

The scientific terms in English used to describe the weather systems generated by highs and lows were introduced in the mid-1800s, mostly by the British. The scientific theories which explain the general phenomena originated about two centuries earlier.

The term [[cyclone]] was coined by [[Henry Piddington]] of the British East India Company to describe the devastating storm of December 1789 in Coringa, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyclone|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cyclone|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cyclone forms around a low-pressure area. [[Anticyclone]], the term for the kind of weather around a high-pressure area, was coined in 1877 by [[Francis Galton]]&lt;ref&gt;| "Word Origin &amp; History" [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anticyclone]|accessed 2013-01-24&lt;/ref&gt; to indicate an area whose winds revolved in the opposite direction of a [[cyclone]]. In British English, the opposite direction of clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise, making the label ''anticyclones'' a logical extension.

A simple rule is that for high-pressure areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the [[coriolis force]] given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs in the case of a high. These results derive from the [[Coriolis effect]]; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.

High-pressure areas form due to downward motion through the [[troposphere]], the [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] layer where [[weather]] occurs.  Preferred areas within a [[synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic]] flow pattern in higher levels of the troposphere are beneath the western side of troughs.

On weather maps, these areas show converging winds ([[Contour line#Wind|isotachs]]), also known as [[Convergence (meteorology)|convergence]], near or above the level of non-divergence, which is near the 500 [[wikt:hectopascal|hPa]] pressure surface about midway up through the troposphere, and about half the atmospheric pressure at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology (2009).

==Connection to wind==
{{Main|Geostrophic wind}}
[[Wind]] flows from areas of high pressure to areas of [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;BWEA (2007). [http://www.bwea.com/edu/wind.html Education and Careers: What is wind?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304181329/http://www.bwea.com/edu/wind.html |date=2011-03-04 }} British Wind Energy Association. Retrieved on 2009-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is due to [[density]] differences between the two [[air mass]]es.  Since stronger high-pressure systems contain cooler or drier air, the air mass is more dense and flows towards areas that are warm or moist, which are in the vicinity of low pressure areas in advance of their associated [[cold front]]s.  The stronger the pressure difference, or pressure gradient, between a high-pressure system and a low-pressure system, the stronger the wind. The [[coriolis force]] caused by the [[Earth]]'s rotation is what gives winds within high-pressure systems their clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure) and counterclockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure).  Friction with land slows down the wind flowing out of high-pressure systems and causes wind to flow more outward than would be the case in the absence of friction. This is known as a [[geostrophic wind]].&lt;ref&gt;JetStream (2008). [http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream//synoptic/wind.htm Origin of Wind.] [[National Weather Service]] Southern Region Headquarters.

'''Isobel Ida Bennett''' [[Order of Australia|AO 1984]] (9 July 1909 &amp;ndash; 12 January 2008) was one of Australia's best-known marine biologists. She (with Elizabeth Pope) assisted [[William John Dakin]] with research for his final book, ''Australian Seashores'', regarded by many as "the definitive guide on the intertidal zone, and a recommended source of information to divers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classicdivebooks.customer.netspace.net.au/oeclassics-marinesciences-australia.html|title=CLASSIC DIVING BOOKS - Marine sciences - Australian authors|website=netspace.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Dakin's death in 1950, she saw the book through to publication in 1952, and she continued to revise and reprint it with a complete revision in 1980 until 1992. In later editions, she was listed as a co-author, then first author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms9348|title=Papers of Isobel Bennett|website=nla.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also wrote nine other books, and was one of the first women (along with Susan Ingham, [[Mary Gillham]] &amp; [[Hope Black|Hope Macpherson]]) to go south with the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE).&lt;ref&gt;. She had one genus and five species of marine organisms (three being from the Great Barrier Reef)[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/01/13/2137327.htm Marine scientist Bennett dies, aged 98 - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Isobel Ida Bennett was born in [[Brisbane]] in 1909 and educated at [[Somerville House]] leaving at the age of 16 when her family moved to Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science.org.au/scientists/ib.htm|title=Interviews with Australian scientists|website=science.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She attended business college and gained employment in a patent office and for four years at the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]] in Sydney, she joined the Zoology Department of the [[University of Sydney]] in 1933. From that time until 1948, she worked as secretary, librarian, demonstrator and research assistant to Professor W.J. Dakin, and then as research assistant to Professor P.D.F. Murray.

From 1950 she regularly led students to the [[Heron Island, Australia|Heron Island]] and [[Lizard Island]] Research Stations on the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and did field work on the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] and [[Tasmania]]n coasts. In 1959 she made her first visit to [[Macquarie Island]] with the [[Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions|ANARE]] relief ship, returning in 1960, 1965 and 1968. From 1959 to 1971, she was a Professional Officer at the University of Sydney, and received the first Honorary Master of Science from the University of Sydney in 1962. She was a temporary Associate Professor at [[Stanford University]] in 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/biogs/P002262b.htm|title=Bennett, Isobel Ida - Biographical entry - Encyclopedia of Australian Science|first=The University of Melbourne eScholarship Research|last=Centre|website=www.asap.unimelb.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a delegate to the 11th Pacific Science Congress in Tokyo in 1966.

She retired in 1971, but remained an active author and researcher. From 1974 to 1979 she worked with the New South Wales Fisheries Department, and during that time, carried out fieldwork and surveys at the coastal rock platforms at [[Jervis Bay]] and [[Ulladulla]], and on the coasts of [[Lord Howe Island]], [[Norfolk Island]]  and [[Flinders Island]].

Bennett died in [[Sydney]] at the age of 98. Her papers and a collection of around 500 colour slides covering the last edition of Australian Seashores  have been donated to the [[National Library of Australia]] and around 400 remaining slides.

== Publications ==
In addition to the editions of ''Australian Seashore'', Bennett wrote the following books;
* ''On the Seashore''  (1969) 21 
* ''Shores of Macquarie Island'' (1971)
* ''The Great Barrier Reef''  (1971)
* ''A Coral Reef Handbook'' (1978)
* ''Discovering Lord Howe Island'' (1979)
* ''Discovering Norfolk Island'' (1983)
* ''Australia's Great Barrier Reef'' (1987)
* ''Australia's deepest blue mystery'' (1932)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3350">'''Joseph Allen''' [[Doctor of Medicine#United Kingdom, Ireland and Commonwealth countries (excluding Canada)|M.D.]] (ca. 1714 – 10 January 1796) was a prominent eighteenth century physician, surgeon on Lord Anson's circumnavigation of the world, and Master of the College of God's Gift in Dulwich (then colloquially called [[Dulwich College]]).&lt;ref name="Roll"&gt;[[William Munk]], (1861), ''The Roll of the Royal College of Physicians of London'', page 228 (Royal College of Physicians of London)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lord Anson's circumnavigation==
Joseph Allen was born in Ireland in around 1714.&lt;ref name="Roll"/&gt; He was bred a surgeon and in this capacity accompanied [[Commodore (RN)|Commodore]] [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|George Anson]] on his celebrated [[George Anson's voyage around the world|circumnavigation of the globe]] from 1740 to 1743.

==Dulwich College==
On his return from his voyage with Lord Anson, Joseph was elected as Warden of the '''College of God's Gift in Dulwich''' on 25 February 1744.&lt;ref name="DCRoll"&gt;Ormiston, T. L., (1926), ''Dulwich College Register'',page 10, (J J Keliher &amp; Co Ltd: London)&lt;/ref&gt; He was not in the post for much beyond two years before the Master of the College, [[James Allen (formerly Alleyn)|James Allen]] died on the 28 October 1746. Joseph, by virtue of his position as Warden, immediately became Master.&lt;ref name="DCRoll"/&gt;

During his time as Master Joseph continued to pursue a medical career and obtained the degree of doctor of medicine from the [[University of St. Andrew's]] on 23 April 1754.&lt;ref name="Roll"/&gt; He was admitted a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] of the [[College of Physicians]] on 30 September 1765.&lt;ref name="Roll"/&gt;

In his capacity as Master of the College, he did little to further [[Edward Alleyn]]'s (the founder) directions to provide every poor scholar with adequate preparation for the world.&lt;ref name="GG17"&gt;Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 17, (Heinemann: London)&lt;/ref&gt;

He vacated the office of Master on 21 June 1775 in order to marry&lt;ref name="Roll"/&gt; a widow, Elizabeth Plaw&lt;ref name="DCRoll"/&gt; (marriage at that time being prohibited for the Master of the College, in adherence with Alleyn's statutes).

==Later life==
On his retirement, his portrait was painted by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]], and this is still in the possession of [[Dulwich College]]. After his wife's death in 1781 he lived a further 15 years, dying on 10 January 1796 following a few days' illness. He was 82 and was the last known survivor of those who had accompanied Lord Anson. In his will he left £500 to the Asylum, £500 to the [[Lying-In Hospital]] and £200 to the [[Parish of Camberwell]] to provide coals for the poor in the Hamlet of [[Dulwich]].&lt;ref name="DCRoll"/&gt;

[[Local Nature Reserve]]s are designated by local authorities under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]]. The local authority must have a legal control over the site, by owning or leasing it or having an agreement with the owner. Local Nature Reserves are sites which have a special local interest either biologically or geologically. Local authorities have a duty to care for them, and can apply local [[Byelaws in the United Kingdom|bye-laws]] to manage and protect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/protected-or-designated-areas|title=Protected or Designated Areas|date=9 April 2013|publisher=Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs and Natural England|accessdate=29 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504145328/https://www.gov.uk/protected-or-designated-areas|archivedate=4 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/create-and-manage-local-nature-reserves|title=Local Nature Reserves: Setting up and Management|date=2 October 2014|publisher=Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs and Natural England|accessdate=29 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704111109/https://www.gov.uk/create-and-manage-local-nature-reserves|archivedate=4 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extremely critical fire weather event is the greatest threat level issued by the [[National Weather Service|NWS]] [[Storm Prediction Center]] (SPC) for [[wildfire]] events in the [[United States]]. Extremely critical areas are issued only several times a year when forecasters at the SPC are confident of extremely dangerous wildfire conditions on a given day. These are typically reserved for the most extreme events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) Fire Weather Outlook Elements NWS Product Description Document (PDD) |work = SPC and its Products |publisher = Storm Prediction Center |date = 2012-03-26 |url = http://products.weather.gov/PDD/ndfdSPCfire.pdf |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[mountain]]s of [[Switzerland]] above {{convert|3000|m|ft|0}}. This height, in the [[Alps]], approximately corresponds to the level of the climatic [[snow line]]. For a list of mountains (major summits only) including lower summits, see [[List of mountains of Switzerland]]. 

This list only includes significant summits with a [[topographic prominence]] of at least {{convert|150|m|ft|0}}. There are 437 such summits exceeding 3,000 m in Switzerland. They are found in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Valais]], [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Graubünden]], [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Ticino]], [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]], [[Obwalden]] and [[Vaud]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Thöni, [http://www.gipfelverzeichnis.ch Directory of the mountains of Switzerland]&lt;/ref&gt; All mountain heights and prominences on the list are from the largest-[[scale (map)|scale]] maps available.&lt;ref name=maps&gt;All mountain heights and prominences are from the 1:25,000 [[Swisstopo]] topographic maps.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases local people or surveyors made earlier ascents. In particular, chamois and ibex hunters are expected to have reached many summits. Years in italics indicate that it is known that an earlier ascent was made, for example by the presence of artifacts on top or the summit's prior use as a triangulation point.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;ascent

[[File:Continental-continental conservative plate boundary opposite directions.svg|thumb|Transform boundary]]
[[File:Continental-continental constructive plate boundary.svg|thumb|Divergent boundary]]
[[File:Continental-continental destructive plate boundary.svg|thumb|Convergent boundary]]

[[Tectonic plate]] interactions are of three different basic types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tectonic Plates and Plate Boundaries|url=http://www.gns.cri.nz/Home/Learning/Science-Topics/Earthquakes/Earthquakes-at-a-Plate-Boundary/Tectonic-Plates-and-Plate-Boundaries|website=[[GNS Science]]|accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Divergent boundary|Divergent boundaries]]''' are areas where plates move away from each other, forming either [[mid-oceanic ridge]]s or [[rift valley]]s. These are also known as constructive boundaries.
* '''[[Convergent boundary|Convergent boundaries]]''' are areas where plates move toward each other and collide. These are also known as compressional or destructive boundaries.
** '''[[Subduction]] zones''' occur where an ''oceanic'' plate meets a ''continental'' plate and is pushed underneath it.  Subduction zones are marked by [[oceanic trench]]es.  The descending end of the oceanic plate melts and creates pressure in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], causing [[volcano]]es to form.
** '''[[Obduction]]''' occurs when the ''continental'' plate is pushed under the ''oceanic'' plate, but this is unusual as the relative densities of the tectonic plates favours subduction of the ''oceanic'' plate. This causes the oceanic plate to buckle and usually results in a new mid ocean ridge forming and turning the obduction into subduction {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
** '''[[Orogeny|Orogenic belts]]''' occur where two continental plates collide and push upwards to form large [[mountain range]]s. These are also known as collision boundaries.
* '''[[Transform boundary|Transform boundaries]]''' occur when two plates grind past each other with only limited convergent or divergent activity.

==Divergent boundaries==
[[File:Plate tectonics map.gif|thumb|upright=1.4|right|Plate tectonics map]]

* The [[East African Rift]] (Great Rift Valley) in eastern Africa
* The [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] system separates the [[North American Plate]] and [[South American Plate]] in the west from the [[Eurasian Plate]] and [[African Plate]] in the east
* The [[Gakkel Ridge]] is a slow spreading ridge located in the [[Arctic Ocean]]

*The [[South American Plate]] is subducting under the [[South Sandwich Plate]], forming the [[South Sandwich Trench]].

==Orogenic belts==
{{Main|List of orogenies}}
* The most dramatic orogenic belt on the planet is the one between the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and [[African Plate]] on one side (to the South) and the [[Eurasian Plate]] on the other side (to the North). This belt runs from New Zealand in the East-SouthEast, through [[Indonesia]], along the [[Himalayas]], through the Middle East up to the Mediterranean in the West-Northwest. It is also called the "Tethyan" Zone, as it constitutes the zone along which the ancient Tethys Ocean was deformed and disappeared. The following mountain belts can be distinguished:
** The European [[Alps]]
** The [[Carpathians]]
** The [[Pyrenees]]
** The [[Apennines]]
** The [[Dinarides]]
** The North African mountain belts such as the [[Atlas Mountains]]
** The [[Kras Plateau|Karst Plateau]] of the Balkan Peninsula
** The [[Caucasus]]
** The [[Zagros]]
** The [[Himalayas]]
** The [[Geography of Indonesia|Indonesian Archipelago]]
** The [[Southern Alps of New Zealand]]
*The [[Andes]] orogenic belt is the latest of a series of [[orogeny|orogenies]] along the western margin of the [[South American Plate]].

==Transform boundaries==
* The [[San Andreas Fault]] in [[California]] is an active transform boundary.  The Pacific Plate (carrying the city of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]) is moving northwards with respect to the North American Plate.
* The [[Queen Charlotte Fault]] on the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast of North America
* The [[Motagua Fault]], which crosses through [[Guatemala]], is a transform boundary between the southern edge of the [[North American Plate]] and the northern edge of the [[Caribbean Plate]].
* New Zealand's [[Alpine Fault]] is another active transform boundary.
* The [[Dead Sea Transform]] (DST) fault which runs through the [[Jordan River]] Valley in the Middle East.
* The [[Owen Fracture Zone]] along the southeastern boundary of the [[Arabian Plate]].

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="469012">This is a '''list of [[vacuum tube]]s''' or ''thermionic valves'', and low-pressure [[gas-filled tube]]s, or ''discharge tubes''. Before the advent of [[semiconductor]] devices, thousands of tube types were used in consumer electronics. Many industrial, military or otherwise professional tubes were also produced. Only a few types are still used today, mainly in high-power, high-frequency applications.

==Heater or filament ratings==
{{main|Hot cathode}}

Receiving tubes have heaters or filaments intended for direct battery operation, parallel operation off a dedicated winding on a supply transformer, or series string operation on transformer-less sets. High-power [[Valve RF amplifier|RF power tubes]] are directly heated; the heater voltage must be much smaller than the signal voltage on the grid and is therefore in the 5...25&amp;nbsp;V range, drawing up to hundreds of amperes from a suitable heater transformer. In some valve part number series, the voltage class of the heater is given in the part number, and a similar valve might be available with several different heater voltage ratings.

==Tube bases and envelopes==
{{main|Tube socket}}

===Abbreviations used in this list===
*'''ST''' – Shouldered tube
*'''GT''' – Glass tube
*'''MT''' – Miniature tube, such as [[Tube socket#Noval base|Noval B9A]] or [[Tube socket#Miniature 7-pin base|Miniature 7-pin B7G]]
*'''FL''' – Subminiature all-glass elliptical body and flat bases with long, inline "flying leads" (pigtails) that are soldered into the circuit
*'''SL''' – Subminiature all-glass elliptical body and flat bases with short inline leads that can be soldered or can be mated with a special socket. (Flying leads can be cut short to fit into inline sockets.)
*'''R8''' – Subminiature all-glass round body and base with 8 flying leads or stiff pins arranged in a circle

==Numbering systems==

===North American systems===

====RMA system (1942)====

{{main|RMA tube designation}}
The system assigned numbers with the base form "1A21", and is therefore also referred to as the "1A21 system".&lt;ref name="DecoderLinks"&gt;[[#General literature and data sheets|See "Decoding type numbers" ff.]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The first numeric character indicated the filament/heater power rating, the second alphabetic character was a code for the function, and the last 2 digits were sequentially assigned, beginning with 21

* Lastly, manufacturers may decide to combine two type numbers into a single name, which their one device can replace, such as: 6DX8/ECL84 (6DX8 and ECL84 being identical devices under different naming schemes) or 6BC5/6CE5 (sufficiently identical devices within the RETMA naming system) and even 3A3/3B2, or 6AC5-GT/6AC5-G (where the single type number, 6AC5-GT/6AC5-G, supersedes both the 6AC5-G and the 6AC5-GT).

Often designations that differed only in their initial numerals would be identical except for heater characteristics.

====Mullard–Philips system====
{{main|Mullard–Philips tube designation}}
This system is very descriptive of what type of device (triode, diode, pentode etc.) it is applied to, as well as the heater/filament type and the base type (octal, noval, etc.).&lt;ref name="DecoderLinks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TypeDesignationCode1967"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tubedata.info/other/TypeDesignationCode1967.pdf |title= Preferred Types of Electron Tubes 1967|format=PDF |accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adhering manufacturers include [[AEG]]&amp;nbsp;(de), [[Amperex Electronic|Amperex]]&amp;nbsp;(us), [[La Compagnie des Lampes#Compagnie des Lampes (1921)|CdL]]&amp;nbsp;(1921,&amp;nbsp;''[[#FrenchMazda|French&amp;nbsp;Mazda]]''&amp;nbsp;brand), [[Compagnie Industrielle Française des Tubes Electroniques|CIFTE]]&amp;nbsp;(fr,&amp;nbsp;''[[#FrenchMazda|Mazda-Belvu]]''&amp;nbsp;brand), [[Edison and Swan Electric Light Company|EdiSwan]]&amp;nbsp;(uk,&amp;nbsp;''[[#BritishMazda|British&amp;nbsp;Mazda]]''&amp;nbsp;brand), [[Radiotechnique]]&amp;nbsp;(fr,&amp;nbsp;''Coprim'',&amp;nbsp;''Miniwatt-Dario''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''RTC''&amp;nbsp;brands), [[C.

=====Standard tubes=====
This part dates back to the joint valve code key ({{lang-de|[[Wiktionary:Röhre|Röhren]]-[[Wiktionary:Gemeinschaft|Gemeinschaft]]s[[Wiktionary:Schlüssel|schlüssel]]}}) negotiated between Philips and Telefunken in 1933–34. Like the North American system the first symbol describes the heater voltage, in this case, a Roman letter rather than a number. Further Roman letters, up to three, describe the device followed by one to four numerals assigned in a semi-chronological order of type development within number ranges assigned to different base types.

If two devices share the same type designation other than the first letter (e.g. ECL82, PCL82, UCL82) they will usually be identical except for heater specifications; however there are exceptions, particularly with output types (for example, both the PL84 and UL84 differ significantly from the EL84 in certain major characteristics, although they have the same pinout and similar power rating). However, device numbers do not reveal any similarity between different type families; e.g. the triode section of an ECL82 is not related to either triode of an ECC82, whereas the triode section of an ECL86 does happen to be similar to those of an ECC83.

''[[Pro Electron]]'' maintained a [[subset]] of the M-P system after their establishment in 1966, with only the first letters '''E''', '''P''' for the heater, only the second letters '''A''', '''B''', '''C''', '''D''', '''E''', '''F''', '''H''', '''K''', '''L''', '''M''', '''Y''', '''Z''' for the type, and issuing only three-digit numbers starting with [[#SQ0000|'''1''', '''2''', '''3''', '''5''', '''8''', '''9''']] for the base.&lt;ref name="PE-D15-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://material.htlwien10.at/wissensspeicher/Halbleiterkennzeichnungen/European_Type_Designation_Code-Sstem_for_Electronic_Components_PE-D15-2008_Pro-Electron.pdf |publisher=[[Pro Electron|Pro-Electron]], Brussels, Belgium |date=June 2008 |title=European Type Designation Code System for Electronic Components |edition=15 |format=PDF |accessdate=25 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229131903/http://material.htlwien10.at/wissensspeicher/Halbleiterkennzeichnungen/European_Type_Designation_Code-Sstem_for_Electronic_Components_PE-D15-2008_Pro-Electron.pdf |archivedate=29 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes:''' [[Tungsram]] preceded the M-P designation with the letter '''T''', as in TAD1 for AD1; ''[[:File:VateaGyar Bp13 Vaci169.jpg|VATEA Rádiótechnikai és Villamossági Rt.-t.]]'' (VATEA Radio Technology and Electric Co.

====={{anchor|MP_SQ}}Special quality tubes=====
Vacuum tubes which had special qualities ({{lang-fr|[[Wiktionary:sécurité|Securité]] - [[Wiktionary:qualité|Qualité]]}}) of some sort, very often long-life designs, particularly for [[computer]] and [[telecommunication]]s use, had the numeric part of the designation placed immediately after the first letter. They were usually special-quality versions of standard types. Thus the E82CC was a long-life version of the ECC82 intended for computer and general signal use, and the E88CC a high quality version of the ECC88/6DJ8. While the E80F pentode was a high quality development of the EF80, they were not pin-compatible and could not be interchanged without rewiring the socket (the E80F is commonly sought after as a high quality replacement for the similar EF86 type in guitar amplifiers). The letters "CC" indicated the two triodes and the "F", the single pentode inside these types.

A few special-quality tubes did not have a standard equivalent, e.g. the E55L, a broadband power pentode used as the output stage of [[oscilloscope]] amplifiers and the E90CC, a double triode with a common cathode connection and seven pin base for use in cathode-coupled [[Flip-flop (electronics)|Flip-flops]] in early computers. The E91H is a special heptode with a passivated third grid designed to reduce secondary emission; this device was used as a "gate", allowing or blocking pulses applied to the first, ([[Control grid|control]]) grid by changing the voltage on the third grid, in early computer circuits (similar in function to the U.S. 6AS6).

Many of these types had gold-plated base pins and special heater configurations inside the nickel cathode tube designed to reduce hum pickup from the A.C. heater supply, and also had improved oxide insulation between the heater and cathode so the cathode could be elevated to a greater voltage above the heater supply. (Note that ''elevating'' the cathode voltage ''above'' the average heater voltage, which in well-designed equipment was supplied from a transformer with an earthed center-tapped secondary, was less detrimental to the oxide insulation between heater and cathode than ''lowering'' the cathode voltage ''below'' the heater voltage, helping to prevent pyrometallurgical electrolytic chemical reactions where the oxide touched the nickel cathode that could form conductive aluminium tungstate and which could ultimately develop into a heater-cathode short-circuit.)

Better, often dual, [[getter]]s were implemented to maintain a better vacuum, and more-rigid electrode supports introduced to reduce [[microphonics]] and improve vibration and shock resistance. The mica spacers used in "SQ" and "PQ" types did not possess sharp protrusions which could flake off and become loose inside the bulb, possibly lodging between the grids and thus changing the characteristics of the device. Some types, particularly the E80F, E88CC and E90CC, had a constricted section of bulb to firmly hold specially shaped flakeless mica spacers.&lt;ref&gt;"Miniwatt" Premium Quality and Special Purpose Tubes, Philips Electrical Industries Pty. Ltd., Australia, November 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military naming systems===

====British CV naming system====

This system prefixes a three- or four-digit number with the letters "CV", meaning "civilian valve" i.e. common to all three armed services. It was introduced during the Second World War to rationalise the previous nomenclatures maintained separately by the War Office/Ministry of Supply, Admiralty and Air Ministry/Ministry of Aircraft Production on behalf of the three armed services (e.g. "ACR~", "AR~", "AT~", etc. for [[Cathode ray tube|CRTs]], receiving and transmitting valves used in army equipments, "NC~", "NR~" and "NT~" similarly for navy equipments and "VCR~", "VR~" and "VT~" etc. for air force equipments), in which three separate designations could in principle apply to the same valve (which often had at least one prototype commercial designation as well). These numbers generally have '''identical equivalents''' in both the North American, RETMA, and West European, Mullard–Philips, systems but they bear no resemblance to the assigned "CV" number.

'''Examples:'''
*CV1988 = [[6SN7]]GT = ECC32 (not a direct equivalent as heater current is different and bulb is larger)
*CV2729 = E80F – An SQ version of EF80 but with revised pin-out and a base screen substituted for the RF screen
*CV4007 = E91AA – SQ version of 6AL5
*CV4010 = E95F – SQ version of [[6AK5]] or EF95
*CV4014 = M8083 – SQ version of EF91 or 6AM6 (The 'M' in the part number denotes that it was developed by the military)

'''Note:''' The 4000 numbers identify special-quality valves though SQ valves CV numbered before that rule came in retain their original CV number.

The principle behind the CV numbering scheme was also adopted by the US Joint Army-Navy JAN numbering scheme which was later considerably expanded into the US Federal and then [[NATO Stock Number]] system used by all NATO countries. This part-identification system ensures that every particular spare part (not merely thermionic valves) receives a unique stock number across the whole of NATO irrespective of the source, and hence is not held inefficiently as separate stores. In the case of CV valves, the stock number is always of the format 5960-99-000-XXXX where XXXX is the CV number (with a leading 0 if the CV number only has 3 digits).

====U.S. naming systems====

One system prefixes a three-digit number with the letters "VT", presumably meaning "Vacuum Tube". Other systems prefix the number with the letters "JHS" or "JAN". The numbers following these prefixes can be "special" four-digit numbers, or domestic two- or three-digit numbers or simply the domestic North American "RETMA" numbering system. Like the British military system, these have many direct equivalents in the civilian types.
Confusingly, the British also had two entirely different "VT" nomenclatures, one used by the Royal Air Force (see the preceding section) and the other used by the [[General Post Office]], responsible for post and telecommunications at the time, where it may have stood for "valve, telephone"; none of these schemes corresponded in any way with each other.

'''Examples:'''
*"VT" numbering systems
:*North American '''VT90''' = '''6H6'''
:*British (RAF) '''VT90''' – [[Very high frequency|VHF]] Transmitting triode
:*British (GPO) '''VT90''' = '''ML4''' = '''CV1732''' – Power triode
:*'''VT104''' – RF pentode
:*'''VT105''' – RF triode

===Other numeral-only systems===

Various numeral-only systems exist. These tend to be used for devices used in commercial or industrial equipment. The oldest numbering systems date back to the early 1920s, such as a two-digit numbering system, starting with the ''UV-201A'', which was considered as "type 01", and extended almost continuously up into the 1980s. Three- and four-digit numeral-only systems were maintained by [[RCA|R.C.A.]], but also adopted by many other manufacturers, and typically encompassed rectifiers and radio transmitter output devices. Devices in the low 800s tend to be transmitter output types, those in the higher 800s are not vacuum tubes, but gas-filled rectifiers and [[thyratron]]s, and those in the 900s tend to be special-purpose and high-frequency devices. Use was not rigorously systematic: the [[807 (vacuum tube)|807]] had variants 1624, 1625, and 807W.

===Other letter followed by numerals===

There are quite a number of these systems from different geographical realms, such as those used on devices from contemporary Russian and Chinese production. Other compound numbering systems were used to mark higher-reliability types used in industrial or commercial applications. Computers and telecommunication equipment also required tubes of greater quality and reliability than for domestic and consumer equipment.

The diode anodes are most commonly used as (second) detectors and AVC rectification in superheterodyne receivers. Because their control grids have both sharp-cutoff and remote-cutoff characteristics, these types were used as I.F. amplifiers with AVC bias to the control grid, and as A.F. amplifiers. These types were also used in [[reflectional receiver|reflex radios]]. In a typical 2B7/6B7/6B8 reflex circuit, the I.F. signal from the converter is injected into the pentode and is amplified. The diodes then act as detectors, separating the A.F. signal from the R.F. signal. The A.F. signal is then re-injected into the pentode, amplified, and sent to the audio output tube.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nostalgiaair.org/PagesByModel/791/M0007791.pdf Schematic for General Electric model F-40], a 1938 reflex radio using a 6B7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of European ''Mullard–Philips'' tubes, with American equivalents==
Most post-war European thermionic valve (vacuum tube) manufacturers have used the ''[[Mullard–Philips tube designation]]'' naming scheme.

Special quality variants may have the letters "SQ" appended, or the device description letters may be swapped with the numerals (e.g. an E82CC is a special quality version of an ECC82)

'''Note:''' Typecode explained [[#Mullard–Philips system|above]]. The part behind a slash ("/") is the [[#RMA system (1942)|RMA]]/[[#RETMA receiving tubes system (1953)|RETMA]]/[[#EIA professional tubes system|EIA]] equivalent.

*'''{{Visible anchor|ES111}}''' – ''TV sync oscillator'' ({{lang-de|[[Wiktionary:kippen#German|Kipp]]-Pentode}}), a special power [[relaxation oscillator]] pentode, an attempt to cut costs on [[Einheitsempfänger|TV receiver]] production; one ES111 each were needed for vertical and horizontal deflection; the output power for the deflection yoke was extracted not from the anode, but from the screen grid, the sync pulses were applied to the suppressor grid via a separate pin. The anode acted only as a small-signal amplified/gated-sync output which was added to the feedback from an auxiliary winding on the deflection yoke, and fed to the [[control grid]]. As there was no vertical deflection output transformer, a secondary, magnetically decoupled vertical deflection yoke received a variable, smoothed-out part of the screen grid current to compensate for its DC component in the primary vertical deflection yoke; it was variable to adjust the vertical picture position on the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] screen. The screen grid delivered enough power even for an EHT winding on the horizontal deflection output transformer and for the 6.3V/0.2A heater of an RFG5 16-kV EHT rectifier.&lt;ref name="FoFu1940"&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[:de:Hanns Günther|Günther, Hanns]] |author2=[[:de:Heinz Richter (Ingenieur)|Richter, Ing.

TM's production volume in France alone is estimated at 1.1 million units; in addition, the production of TM and/or improved versions was started in the UK ([[Marconi-Osram Valve|Marconi–Osram]] '''R''' tube), the Netherlands ([[Philips]] '''E''' tube), the United States and the Soviet Union ('''R-5''', Russian: '''Р-5''').&lt;sup&gt;([[:ru:TM (триод)|ru]])&lt;/sup&gt;
:The TM was developed in 1914–15 by the French military telecommunications service ''Télégraphie Militaire'' on the initiative of their technical director [[Gustave-Auguste Ferrié]]. He and his assistant, physicist [[Henri Abraham]], visited the American laboratories on a number of occasions and were aware of the works of [[Lee de Forest]], [[Reginald A. Fessenden]] and [[Irving Langmuir]]. They knew that de Forest's Audion and [[H. J. Round|Henry Round's]] British tube were unreliable and imperfect, and Langmuir's ''Pliotron'' was too complex for mass production. They also knew about the latest German developments: Soon after the outbreak of the war, Ferrié received extensive information from a former [[Telefunken]] employee, the Frenchman Paul Pichon, who, upon return from a mission from his German employer to gather samples of the latest triodes from the USA, had to surrender himself and the samples to the French. The samples Pichon brought performed poorly due to insufficient vacuum. Following the ideas of Langmuir, Ferrié required the industry to guarantee a high vacuum in series production.
:In October 1914, Ferrié, Abraham and François Péri from the radiotelegraph centre in [[Lyon]]/La-Doua&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:La Doua|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt; went to the [[Incandescent light bulb|light bulb]] department of ''Société des Téléphones E.C.&amp;Alexandre Grammont'' in Lyon to develop with them a triode suitable for mass production. The first prototypes, mere copies of de Forest's ''Audion'', proved to be unreliable and unstable; the next ones were rejected for being too complex. Only the fourth prototype developed in December 1914, with a vertical coaxial system, an [[Edison screw]] lamp base for the filament and additional side terminals for anode and grid, was deemed suitable for series production, which started in February 1915 and stopped in October 1915 when it became clear that the vertical structure of "Abraham's Lamp" was too fragile and too many tubes were damaged during transport. Ferrié asked Péri to resolve the problem, and two days later Péri and Jacques Biguet came up with a horizontal coaxial system on the latest four-pin type "A" base. The series production of the Péri/Biguet tubes, named '''TM''' after Ferrié's service unit, began in November 1915 under Grammont's ''Radio Fotos'' brand; this variant became highly successful, and when demand started to exceed Grammont's production capacity, Compagnie des Lampes (1888) in [[Ivry-sur-Seine]] also started production under their ''Métal'' brand. Ferrié and Abraham were nominated for the 1916 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their work in the field of radio communications.
:The TM is a cylindrical/coaxial triode; the directly-heated cathode is a filament made of pure [[tungsten]] with a diameter of 60&amp;nbsp;μm, the anode is a [[nickel]] cylinder with a diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;mm and a length of 15&amp;nbsp;mm. The dimensions and material of the grid depend on the place of production – the Grammont plant in Lyon used [[molybdenum]] wire, the CdL plant in Ivry-sur-Seine used nickel. The diameter of the grid spiral is 4 resp. 4.5&amp;nbsp;mm. The filament required 4&amp;nbsp;V and 700&amp;nbsp;mA to bring it up to white heat; the bright glow prompted Grammont in 1923 to start producing TM tubes with dark blue glass envelopes to protect the eyes of radio operators from the blinding glare, and hide the harmless, but unsightly plaque of metal particles inevitably deposited on the inner wall of the bulb while evacuating during production – but also prevented the triodes' previous, secondary use as light sources, which had earned them their nickname ''[[wiktionary:fr:loupiote|Loupiote]]'' ("little lamp").
:The TM could be used for their intended purpose, amplifying and detecting signals in radio receivers, or as power oscillators in low-power radio transmitters, and also, by paralleling of several tubes, as AF power amplifiers. The Soviet analogue of the TM, the triode R-5, could withstand anode voltages of up to 500...800&amp;nbsp;V, and was able to deliver a power of up to 1&amp;nbsp;W in [[Amplifier#Class C|Class-C mode]], but only 40&amp;nbsp;mW in [[Amplifier#Class A|Class-A mode]]. A typical single-TM radio receiver of World War I ran at U&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=40&amp;nbsp;V, U&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;=0&amp;nbsp;V, I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;≈2&amp;nbsp;mA, [[Transconductance|g&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;]]=400&amp;nbsp;[[Siemens (unit)|μS]], [[Internal resistance|R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]]=25&amp;nbsp;kΩ, [[Gain (electronics)|μ]]=10. With an anode voltage of 160&amp;nbsp;V and a grid bias of -2&amp;nbsp;V, the anode current was 3...6&amp;nbsp;mA, while the reverse grid current reached 1&amp;nbsp;μA.&lt;ref&gt;[[:c:File:TM triode curves.svg|Grid-anode curves for the Soviet R-5 triode]], a licensed clone of the French TM triode made by La Compagnie des Lampes (1888)&lt;/ref&gt;
:The problem of TM tubes was their short service life of 100&amp;nbsp;hours maximum – if the tube was manufactured in strict accordance with the specifications. In wartime, this was not always possible; due to raw materials supply problems, plants sometimes had to use substandard materials. Such tubes were marked with a cross; they differed from the standard by a higher [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] level and were prone to catastrophic failures due to cracks in the glass envelope.

===Shielded tubes for Majestic radios===
In the early 1930s, the Grigsby-Grunow Company – makers of Majestic brand radios – introduced the first American-made tubes to incorporate metal shields. These tubes had metal particles sprayed onto the glass envelope, copying a design common to European tubes of the time. Early types were shielded versions of tube types already in use. (The shield was connected to the cathode.) The Majestic numbers of these tube types, which are usually etched on the tube's base, have a "G" prefix (for '''G'''rigsby-'''G'''runow) and an "S" suffix (for '''s'''hielded). Later types incorporated an extra pin in the base so that the shield could be connected directly to the chassis.

Replacement versions from other manufacturers, such as [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] or [[General Electric]], tend to incorporate the less expensive, form-fitting Goat brand shields that are cemented to the glass envelope.

Grigsby-Grunow did not shield rectifier tubes (except for type '''6Y5''' listed below) or power output tubes.

*'''Early types based on existing tubes.''' (Non-shielded versions may be used, but add-on shielding is recommended.)

Not to be confused with Compagnie des Lampes (1888, see [[#Compagnie des Lampes (1888, "Métal") system|above]]) nor with British Mazda (see [[#BritishMazda|above]]).

The 1921 incarnation of ''[[La Compagnie des Lampes]]'' (since 1953 as ''Lampe Mazda'') made light bulbs and electronic tubes under the French ''[[Mazda (light bulb)|Mazda]]'' brand. Many of their tubes were also available from ''[[Compagnie Industrielle Française des Tubes Electroniques]]'' (CIFTE)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiomuseum.org/dsp_hersteller_detail.cfm?company_id=9235 La Compagnie des Lampes on radiomuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; under their ''Mazda-Belvu'' brand, which otherwise used mostly [[#EIA professional tubes system|EIA]], [[#RETMA receiving tubes system (1953)|RETMA]] and [[#Mullard–Philips system|Mullard–Philips]] tube designations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12327">When a [[World War I]] medal was issued to a member of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces, it was issued with a Service Number, Rank, Name and Regiment.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} This information should be on every medal that was issued during the First World War.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

During [[World War I]], there were four main medals issued: the [[1914 Star]], [[1914-15 Star]], [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]], and the [[British War Medal]]. 
[[File:1914-15 Star, Victory Medal, British War Medal.jpg|frame|Center|From Left 1914-15 Star, Victory Medal, British War Medal]]

==Service Number==
From a service number it is sometimes possible to determine in which part of the army a medal holder served.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} However, this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;This does '''not''' apply to the [[Silver War Badge (SWB)]], which has its own code.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbreviations for Rank and Unit==
There are many abbreviations for the rank and unit. The British National archive gives full listings of both Ranks and Units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/help/abbreviations-rank.asp Rank abbreviations] British National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/help/abbreviations-unit.asp Unit abbreviations] British National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gospel of Matthew Chapters}}
'''Matthew 3''' is the third chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]]. It is the first chapter dealing with the [[ministry of Jesus]] with events taking place some three decades after the close of the infancy narrative related in the previous two chapters. The focus of this chapter is on the preaching of [[John the Baptist]] and the [[Baptism of Jesus]].

For the first time since [[Matthew 1:1]] there are clear links with the [[Gospel of Mark]]. Many scholars are certain a good portion of this chapter is a reworking of [[Mark 1]]. The chapter also parallels [[Luke 3]], also believed to be based on Mark 1. A number of passages shared by Luke and Matthew, but not found in Mark, are commonly ascribed to the hypothetical source [[Q source|'Q']].

==Structure==
The [[New King James Version]] organises this chapter as follows:
*{{bibleverse||Matthew|3:1-12|NKJV}} - John the Baptist Prepares the Way
*{{bibleverse||Matthew|3:13-17|NKJV}} - John Baptizes Jesus

The chapter opens with a portrait of John the Baptist. It describes his preaching, clothing, and diet, presenting him as a preacher in the wilderness prophesizing about the "wrath to come". The chapter then moves to a tirade, ascribed to John, against the [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]] in which he warns them to repent. This includes the famous "generation of vipers" line at [[Matthew 3:7]]. Jesus then arrives from [[Galilee]] to be baptized. The chapter closes with the Baptism of Jesus, the [[Vox dei|voice]] of the [[God the Father|Father]], and the appearance of the [[Holy Spirit]] in the form of a [[Columbidae|dove]].

In the [[King James Version]] this chapter reads:

{{small|[[Matthew 3:1|1]]}}In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:2|2]]}}And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:3|3]]}}this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:4|4]]}}And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:5|5]]}}Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:6|6]]}}And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:7|7]]}}But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:8|8]]}}Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:9|9]]}}And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:10|10]]}}And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:11|11]]}}I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:12|12]]}}Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:13|13]]}}Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:14|14]]}}But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:15|15]]}}And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:16|16]]}}And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:&lt;br&gt;
{{small|[[Matthew 3:17|17]]}}And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

'''Mount Parnassus''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɑr|ˈ|n|æ|s|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Παρνασσός}}, ''Parnassos'') is a mountain of [[limestone]] in central [[Greece]] that towers above [[Delphi]], north of the [[Gulf of Corinth]], and offers scenic views of the surrounding [[olive]] groves and countryside. According to [[Greek mythology]], this mountain was sacred to [[Dionysus]] and the [[Dionysian mysteries]]; it was also sacred to [[Apollo]] and the [[Corycian]] [[nymph]]s, and it was the home of the [[Muse]]s.  The mountain was also favored by the [[Dorians]]. It is suggested that the name derives from ''parnassas'', the possessive adjective of the [[Luwian language|Luwian]] word ''parna'' meaning ''house'', or specifically ''temple'', so the name effectively means the ''mountain of the house of the god''.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;Palmer, Leonard R., 1961, "Mycenaeans and Minoans", pp.241-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology and geography==
Parnassus is one of the largest mountainous regions of Mainland Greece and one of the highest Greek mountains. It spreads  over three municipalities, namely of [[Boeotia]], [[Phthiotis]] and [[Phocis]], where its largest part lies. Its altitude is 2,457 meters and its highest peak is Liakouras. To the Northeast it is connected to [[Mount Giona|Giona]] and to the south with Kirphe. Its name is due to the homonymous hero of the Greek mythology, son of Cleopompus (or [[Poseidon]]) and Cleodora, who had built on the mountain a city which was destroyed in the [[Flood myth|Deluge]] of [[Deukalion]]. Etymological analysis, however, shows a prehellenic origin of the name, relating it to the [[Pelasgians]], and it appears to be from the Anatolian language [[Luwian]].&lt;ref name="Palmer" /&gt; 
The mountain is delimited to the east by the valley of the Boeotian Kephissus and to the West by the valley of [[Amfissa]]. The geological particularity of Parnassus is its rich deposits of [[bauxite]], which has led to their systematic mining since the end of the 1930s, resulting in ecological damage to part of the mountain.&lt;ref name="racot"&gt;Racot, A., 1967,"Les Parnassiens, introduction and commentaries by M. Pakenham", presented by Louis Forestier, ''Aux Lettres modernes: collection avant-siècle''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
[[File:Life_of_Orpheus_Greek_Mythology_(Extra_Details).svg|thumb|Orpheus, life and events in Parnassus.]]

Mount Parnassus is named after Parnassos, the son of the [[nymph]] [[Kleodora]] and the man Kleopompus. A city, of which Parnassos was leader, was flooded by torrential rains. The citizens ran from the flood, following wolves' howling, up the mountain slope. There the survivors built another city, and called it Lykoreia, which in [[Greek language|Greek]] means "the howling of the wolves." While [[Orpheus]] was living&lt;ref&gt;The Greek Gods by Hoopes And Evslin , {{ISBN|0-590-44110-8}}, {{ISBN|0-590-44110-8}}, 1995, page 77
His father was a Thracian king; His mother the muse Calliope. For a while he lived on Parnassus with his mother and his eight beautiful aunts, and there met Apollo who was courting the laughing muse Thalia. Apollo was taken with Orpheus, gave him his little golden lyre, and taught him to play.  His mother taught him to make verses for singing.
&lt;/ref&gt; with his mother and his eight beautiful aunts on Parnassus, he met [[Apollo]] who was courting the laughing muse [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]]. Apollo became fond of [[Orpheus]] and gave him a little golden lyre, and taught him to play it. Orpheus's mother taught him to make verses for singing. As the [[Oracle of Delphi]] was sacred to the god [[Apollo]], so did the mountain itself become associated with [[Apollo]]. According to some traditions, Parnassus was the site of the fountain [[Castalia]] and the home of the Muses; according to other traditions, that honor fell to [[Mount Helicon]], another mountain in the same range. As the home of the Muses, Parnassus became known as the home of poetry, music, and learning.

Parnassus was also the site of several unrelated minor events in Greek mythology.
*In some versions of the Greek [[Deluge (mythology)|flood myth]], the ark of [[Deucalion]] comes to rest on the slopes of Parnassus. This is the version of the myth recounted in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.
*[[Orestes]] spent his time in hiding on Mount Parnassus.
*Parnassus was sacred to the god [[Dionysus]].
*The [[Corycian Cave]], located on the slopes of Parnassus, was sacred to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and to the Muses.
*In Book 19 of [[The Odyssey]], Odysseus recounts a story of how he was gored in the thigh during a boar hunt on Mount Parnassus in his youth.

Parnassus was also the home of [[Pegasus]], the [[hippogryph|winged horse]] of [[Bellerophon]].

==As metaphor==
[[File:Parnassos05.jpg|thumb|Mount Parnassus.]]

This relation of the mountain to the [[Muses]] offered an instigation to its more  recent "mystification", with the poetic-artistic trend of the 19th century called "[[Parnassism]]". The Parnassic movement was established in France in the decade 1866–1876 as a reaction to Romanticism with a return to some classicistic elements and belief in the doctrine "Art for the Art", first expressed by [[Theophile Gautier]]. The periodical ''Modern Parnassus'' issued for the first time by Catul Mendes and Xavier Ricard contained direct references to Mt. Parnassus and its mythological feature as habitation of the Muses. The Parnassists, who did not exceed a group of twenty poets, exercised a relatively strong influence on the cultural life of Paris, particularly due to their tenacity on perfection of rhyme and vocabulary.  Parnassism influenced several French poets, but it also exercised an influence on Modern Greek poets, particularly [[Kostis Palamas]] and Gryparis.
The name of the mountain (Mont Parnasse) was also given to a quarter of [[Paris]] on the left bank of the Seine, where artists and  poets used to  gather and recite their poems in public.  [[Montparnasse]] is nowadays one of the most renowned quarters of the city and in its cemetery many personalities of the arts and culture are buried.&lt;ref name="racot"/&gt;

Parnassus figures earlier in Jonathan Swift's ''[[The Battle of the Books]]'' (1697) as the site of an ideological war between the ancients and the moderns.

==The National Park==
The significant biodiversity, both in flora and in fauna, led the authorities to the establishment of the National Park of Parnassus in 1938, the year when the systematic mining of bauxite started. The Park comprises a landscape of {{convert|36,000|acres|order=flip}} spreading on the mountainous region between Delphi, [[Arachova]] and Agoriani. Among the endemic flora species under protection are the [[Abies cephalonica|Cephalonian fir]] tree and the Parnassian [[peony]] (''Paeonia parnassica''). In the Park sojourn prey birds and wolves, boars, badgers and weasels.

==Parnassos Ski Resort==
The slopes of Mount Parnassus are composed of two [[skiing|ski]] sections, Kellaria and Fterolakka, which together make up the largest ski center in Greece. A smaller ski center (only two drag lifts) called Gerontovrahos is across a ridge from Kellaria. Parnassus is mined for its abundant supply of bauxite which is converted to [[aluminium oxide]] and then to [[aluminium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parnassos-ski.gr/index_eng.htm The Parnassos Ski Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822070652/http://www.parnassos-ski.gr/index_eng.htm |date=2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the ski resort started in 1975 and was completed in 1976, when the first two drag lifts operated in Fterolaka. In 1981 the construction of a new ski area was completed in Kelaria, while in winter season 1987–1988 the chair lift Hermes started operating and connected the two ski areas. Both ski resorts continued expanding and in 1993 the first high-speed quad in Greece was installed, named Hercules. In 2014–2015 two new hybrid lifts were installed along with a new eight-seater, replacing the old infrastructure.

Today the Ski Center operates with 16 lifts, two hybrid ski lifts which combine an eight-seater Cabin and a six-seater chair, an eight-seater Cabin, a 4-seater chair lift, a 2-seater chair lift, 6 drag lifts and four baby lifts. The ski center boasts 25 marked ski runs and about 15 ski routes of {{convert|36|km|0|abbr=on}} total length while the longest run is {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}}.

The [[EIA standards|EIA]] type '''4307A''' is a power output [[pentode]] possessing a similar power rating, but significantly different characteristics to the far more common type [[807 (vacuum tube)|807]] thermionic valve/vacuum tube. The "SY" prefix denotes the site of manufacture as being Sydney. The plant, operated by Standard Telephones and Cables Pty. Ltd. was located on Mandible Street&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=5062416 N.S.W. Office of Environment and Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; in the suburb of Alexandria and existed under that corporate entity from 1937 to 1970&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoas.info/biogs/A001445b.htm Encyclopedia of Australian Science]&lt;/ref&gt;.. Although the remaining structure postdates the depicted device, this device was likely assembled on an adjoining property upon which the structures have been demolished and site re-purposed.

Electrically equivalent devices marked "307A" were manufactured in North America by Western Electric and these possibly predate the Australian version.

==Uses==

Although the 807 is used for both audio amplification, (usually [[class AB]]), and radio frequency amplification in the 1-30&amp;nbsp;MHz range, (usually [[Amplifier#Class C|class C]]), this type was usually used for the latter.&lt;br /&gt;
This tube/valve is a pentode with a 'directly heated cathode', meaning that the cathode consists of an emissive oxide coated filament. These features suggest the 4307A could predate and is contemporary with, the 807 which is a beam power tetrode, a more advanced design with a more linear transfer characteristic and a more complex 'indirectly heated cathode'.

==Similarity to 807==

If the pinout of the 4307A is compared to that of the [[807 (vacuum tube)|807]] the similarity is striking. All pins are assigned equivalent electrodes with the exception of pin 4, which is the suppressor grid, g3, in this type but in the 807 pin 4 is connected to the equivalent of a suppressor grid, the 'beam plates' and also the separate indirectly heated cathode.
It is possible to interchange the two with the relatively minor alteration involving the linking of pins 4 and 5 and ensuring the heater supply is [[Floating_ground|floating]] (not connected to other heaters). If the heater is supplied from an [[Alternating current|A.C.]] source, linking pin 4 to the centre of that source and the cathode [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] minimizes hum pickup.

==Historical significance==

The STC/Brimar-made '''SY4307A''' was used extensively during World War II by the Australian armed forces and the example depicted is marked on the [[Bakelite]] collar of its base with the "D broad arrow D" commonwealth department of defense mark.

Two SY4307As were used, wired in parallel, as the output stage, or "final", in a transmitter constructed clandestinely by the Australian soldiers of Sparrow Force in Japanese occupied Portuguese Timor in 1942. This transmitter became known affectionately as "[http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/japadvance/boots.html Winnie the War Winner]", named after the British wartime Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]].

The '''Southeast Tibet shrub and meadows''' are a [[montane grassland]] [[ecoregion]] that cover the southeast and eastern parts of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] in [[China]].  The meadows in this region of [[Tibet]] are in the path of the [[monsoon]] rains and are wetter than the other upland areas of the Tibetan Plateau.  Chinese [[provinces of China|provinces]] covered by the Southeast Tibet shrub and meadows include the alpine parts of eastern [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], the alpine parts of western and northern [[Sichuan]], extreme southern and eastern [[Qinghai]], and the montane areas of southern [[Gansu]].  Many mountain ranges support the Southeast Tibet meadows, stretching from the [[Nyainqêntanglha Mountains]] in the southwest to the [[Qilian Mountains]] in the northeast.&lt;ref name="species"&gt;{{cite web|title=Southeast Tibet shrub and meadows|url=http://www.globalspecies.org/ecoregions/display/PA1017|website=Global Species|publisher=Myers Enterprises II|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by the Asian monsoon, he Southeast Tibet shrub and meadows experience seasonal climatic variation.  Dry conditions in the winter lead to primarily brown landscapes, but summer rains revitalize grasses and turn the landscapes green.  To the northwest, the meadows transition to the drier [[Tibetan Plateau alpine shrub and meadows]].

Human activity is fairly high as the Southeast Tibet shrub and meadows provide grazing areas for domestic animals such as [[yak]].  While not well suited for most agriculture, [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]] [[Tibetan people]] live across the region.&lt;ref name="species" /&gt;  The northeastern part of this ecoregion was traditionally known as [[Amdo]] to Tibetans, while the southwestern part made up the higher elevation portions of [[Kham]].

[[Image:Specular highlight.jpg|frame|Specular highlights on a pair of spheres]]

'''Specularity''' is the visual appearance of [[specular reflection]]s. 

==In [[computer graphics]]==
In computer graphics, it means the quantity used in three-dimensional (3D) [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] which represents the amount of [[Reflection coefficient|reflectivity]] a surface has. It is a key component in determining the [[brightness]] of [[specular highlights]], along with [[wikt:shininess|shininess]] to determine the size of the [[specular highlight|highlights]].

It is frequently used in [[real-time computer graphics]] and [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], where the mirror-like specular reflection of [[light]] from other surfaces is often ignored (due to the more intensive computations required to calculate it), and the specular reflection of light directly from point light sources is modelled as specular highlights.

=== Specular maps ===

A [[materials system]] may allow specularity to vary across a surface, controlled by additional layers of [[texture maps]].

===The early misinterpretation of "Specularity" in computer graphics===

Early shaders included a parameter called "Specularity". CG Artists, confused by this term discovered by experimentation that the manipulation of this parameter would cause a reflected highlight from a light source to appear and disappear and therefore misinterpreted "specularity" to mean "light highlights". In fact "Specular" is defined in optics as ''Optics. (of reflected light) directed, as from a smooth, polished surface (opposed to diffuse ).'' A specular surface is a highly smooth surface.  When the surface is very smooth, the reflected highlight is easy to see.  As the surface becomes rougher, the reflected highlights gets broader and dimmer.  This is a more "diffused" reflection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/specular.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Specular reflection]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/refln/Lesson-1/Specular-vs-Diffuse-Reflection&lt;/ref&gt;

This misinterpretation has been taught from generation to generation of CG artists creating significant cost problems in visual effects problems as artists and technicians struggle to understand how cryptically and inappropriately named shader parameters are intended to work.

==In [[seismology]]==
In the context of [[seismic migration]], specularity is defined as the cosine of the angle made by the [[surface normal]] vector and the [[angle bisector]] of the angle defined by the directions of the incident and diffracted rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Moser | first1 = T.J. | last2 = Howard | first2 = C.B. | title = Diffraction imaging in depth | journal = Geophysical Prospecting | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | year = 2008 | pages = 627–641 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2478.2007.00718.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a purely specular seismic event the value of specularity should be equal to unity, as the angle between the surface normal vector and the angle bisector should be zero, according to Snell's Law. For a diffractive seismic event, the specularity can be sub-unitary. During the seismic migration, one can filter each seismic event according to the value of specularity, in order to enhance the contribution of [[diffraction]]s in the seismic image. Alternatively, the events can be separated in different sub-images according to the value of specularity to produce a [[specularity gather]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Sturzu | first1 = I.| title = Specularity Gathers for Diffraction Imaging | journal = 75th EAGE Conference &amp; Exhibition incorporating SPE EUROPEC | year = 2013 | doi = 10.3997/2214-4609.20130700 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2206">[[Image:Pyramid Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Pyramid Mountain (Wells Gray-Clearwater)|Pyramid Mountain]], a subglacial mound in British Columbia, Canada]]
A '''subglacial mound''' (SUGM) is a type of [[subglacial volcano]]. This type of volcano forms when [[lava]] erupts beneath a thick [[glacier]] or [[ice sheet]]. The magma forming these volcanoes was not hot enough to melt a vertical pipe right through the overlying glacial ice, instead forming [[hyaloclastite]] and [[pillow lava]] deep beneath the glacial ice field. Once the glaciers had retreated, the subglacial volcano would be revealed, with a unique shape as a result of their confinement within glacial ice.&lt;ref name="ZLD"&gt;{{cite web | title = Types of volcanoes | work = Volcanoes of Canada | publisher = [[Geological Survey of Canada]] | date = 2008-02-25 | url = http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/type_e.php | accessdate = 2008-09-24 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090202064852/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/type_e.php | archivedate = 2009-02-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are somewhat rare worldwide, being confined to regions which were formerly covered by continental ice sheets and also had active volcanism during the same period. They are found throughout [[Iceland]], [[Antarctica]] and the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]].

Subglacial mounds can be mistaken for [[cinder cone]]s because they may have a similar shape. An example of this confusion is [[Pyramid Mountain (Wells Gray-Clearwater)|Pyramid Mountain]] in the [[Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field]] of east-central British Columbia, Canada.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite web | title = Pyramid Mountain | work = Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes | publisher = [[Geological Survey of Canada]] | date = 2005-08-19 | url = http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=wcb_pmt_023 | accessdate = 2008-09-24 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080424054225/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=wcb_pmt_023 | archivedate = 2008-04-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Battle of Olympus'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|''Ai no Densetsu Olympus no Tatakai''|愛の伝説 オリュンポスの戦い|lit. "Legend of Love Battle of Olympus"}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}} is a 1988 [[Action role-playing game|action rpg]] [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?a=page_h_title&amp;title_id=19703|title=愛の伝説 オリュンポスの戦い [ファミコン]|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Famitsu]]|publisher=[[Enterbrain, Inc.]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730235911/https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?a=page_h_title&amp;title_id=19703|archive-date=2018-07-30|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-07-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in North America in 1989, in Europe in 1991. A port for the [[Game Boy]] was also released.  
== Plot ==
''The Battle of Olympus'' takes place in an [[ancient Greece]] which is being terrorized by [[Hades]], the dark ruler of the [[underworld]].

Helene, the girlfriend of [[Orpheus]], is kidnapped by Hades who is holding her captive. A top-down map of Greece shows various dungeons and ancient Greek city-states for the player to visit on their journey. [[Sword]]s, [[shield]]s, and [[crystal]]s help to provide offensive power and defensive strength for the player. Three fragments of love are there to remind Orpheus of his girlfriend Helene. Hades rules his dominion in [[Tartarus]], where his strongest minions live alongside him.

During his adventure, Orpheus needs to meet the [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]] and gain their favor, starting with [[Zeus]], the leader of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]], who encourages the other gods to grant Orpheus powers. These powers are in the form of a weapon, a shield, and other special equipment, among them a harp, which summons [[Pegasus]] to carry Orpheus to far locations. As the game progresses, players are exposed to various forms of upgraded weaponry. The player starts off with a basic wooden club. The player later obtains items such as the Staff of Fennel (also known as a [[thyrsus]], which is able to project a fireball), Nymph's Sword, and the Divine Sword (able to project a lightning bolt).

The game features encounters with mythological creatures such as the [[Taurus (constellation)#Mythology|Taurus]], [[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]], [[cyclops]], [[centaur]], [[Talos]], [[Minotaur]], [[Medusa]], [[Cerberus]], [[Stymphalian birds]], [[Nemean lion]], and also a [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]. Players must fight their way deep into the [[underworld]], fight and defeat [[Hades]], and finally save Helene. Several items depicted in the Greek mythology are acquired, such as the Harp of Apollo, the Sword of [[Hephaestus]], the Staff of [[Prometheus]], and the Sandals of [[Hermes]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:The_Battle_of_Olympus.png|250px|thumb|Screenshot of the game|alt=|left]]
Primarily a sidescroller with some light platforming, the player is a hero with a sword and shield, while just a handful of secondary items come along later in the game, mostly for the purpose of advancement as the protagonist move to new areas. He can find upgrades maximum health, protection, and speed. The biggest differences in combat from Zelda II are the lack of the downward stab in midair, and the lack of the sword beam at full health. However, ''The Battle of Olympus'' does have a sword later in the game that can shoot beams, but doing so damages the [[health bar]] if a certain item is not found first.

''The Battle of Olympus'' is somewhat non-linear and there are some optional side quests that can make the game easier in the long run, leading to a secret item or power-up from one of the gods.

The final battle brings to the Temple of Hades in fight with the ruler of the underworld in a two-stage event. The first is a blind fight against a shadow reflection, and then the final form is of Hades himself.

== Development ==
It was developed by Infinity, and was the first game from the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infinity-soft.co.jp/work2.html|title=コンピュータ・ゲーム・ソフトウェアの委託開発、移植、企画、制作 ソフトウェアの制作、販売|last=|first=|date=2012-07-21|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721075450/http://www.infinity-soft.co.jp/work2.html|archive-date=2012-07-21|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dev team for the game was quite small, with only three members.

== Release ==
It was published by [[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]] and released in [[Japan]] on March 28, 1988.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In North America it was released in December 1989, and published by [[Brøderbund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212200410/http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/downloads/nes_games.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=2006-02-12|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in [[Europe]] in 1991 and published by [[Nintendo]]. 

There's also a {{vgy|1993}} [[Game Boy]] port of the same game that was published by [[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]] exclusively for the European market. Despite its strong resemblance to the NES original, Infinity had no involvement in that version and was instead ported by the [[Canadians|Canadian]] developer [[Radical Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="usgamer12" /&gt;

A '''volcanic block''' is a fragment of [[rock (geology)|rock]] that measures more than {{Convert|64|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and is erupted in a solid condition. 

Blocks are formed from material from previous eruptions or from [[Country rock (geology)|country rock]] and are therefore mostly accessory or accidental in origin. Blocks also occur due to the impact and breakage of [[volcanic bombs]] (a bomb is a block with streamlined appearance, often expelled in a molten state). Bombs can also occur due to the disruption of the crust of a lava dome that has formed up or over a vent during an eruption. 

==Features==
Blocks are nearly always angular to sub-angular and roughly equidimensional. If the parent rock is flow-foliated lava, sedimentary material or [[schistose]] metamorphic rocks, the blocks may have a plate-like or slab-like form. In other cases, blocks derived from great depths may resemble polished water-worn pebbles and are cobbled due to fluidisation and upwards transport.

Blocks can be enormous and may be transported great distances from the [[volcanic vent]]. The 1924 eruption of [[Kīlauea]], [[Hawaii]], expelled rocks weighing up to 14 tons; and Mount [[Vesuvius]] in [[Italy]] discharged blocks weighing 2-3 tons over distances of 100-200m.

The '''Vredefort crater''' is the largest verified [[impact crater]] on [[Earth]], more than {{convert|300|km}} across when it was formed.&lt;ref name=DB&gt;{{Cite Earth Impact DB | name = Vredefort | accessdate = 2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="current record"&gt;{{cite web| title = Deep Impact - The Vredefort Dome| url=http://www.hartrao.ac.za/other/vredefort/vredefort.html| publisher= [[Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory]]| accessdate = 2007-09-19| date = 2006-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; What remains of it is located in the present-day [[Free State (province)|Free State province]] of South Africa and named after the town of [[Vredefort]], which is situated near its centre. Although the crater itself has long since eroded away, the remaining geological structures at its centre are known as the '''Vredefort Dome''' or '''Vredefort impact structure'''. The crater is estimated to be 2.023 billion years old (± 4 million years), with impact being in the [[Paleoproterozoic]] Era. It is the second-oldest-known crater on Earth.

In 2005, the Vredefort Dome was added to the list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]]s for its geologic interest.

==Formation and structure==
[[File:Map of Vredefort dome.jpg|thumb|left|Map of South Africa showing the location of the Vredefort Dome, the remains of a 2.023-billion-year-old impact crater. The interrupted line circle, 300&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, marks the extent of the original crater.]]

The [[asteroid]] that hit Vredefort is estimated to have been one of the largest ever to strike Earth (at least since the [[Hadean]] Eon some four billion years ago), thought to have been approximately {{convert|10|–|15|km|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;McCarthy, T., Rubridge, B. (2005). "The Story of Earth and Life". p. 89–90, 102–107, 134–136. Struik Publishers, Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bolide]] that created the [[Sudbury Basin]] could have been even larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The original crater was estimated to have a diameter of roughly {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="current record"/&gt; although this has been eroded away. It would have been larger than the {{convert|250|km|abbr=on}} Sudbury Basin and the {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} [[Chicxulub crater]]. The remaining structure, the "Vredefort Dome", consists of a partial ring of hills 70&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, and are the remains of a dome created by the [[Isostatic rebound|rebound]] of rock below the impact site after the collision.

The crater's age is estimated to be 2.023&amp;nbsp;billion years (± 4 million years),&lt;ref name=DB/&gt; which places it in the [[Paleoproterozoic]] Era. It is the second-oldest-known crater on Earth, a little less than 300 million years younger than the [[Suavjärvi crater]] in Russia. In comparison, it is about 10% older than the Sudbury Basin impact (at 1.849 billion years).
[[File:Earth's geolological timeline.svg|thumb|500x500px|A timeline of the Earth's history indicating when the Vredefort crater was formed in relation to some of the other important [[South Africa#Geography|South African]] geological events. '''W''' indicates when the [[Witwatersrand Basin|Witwatersrand Supergroup]] was laid down, '''C''' the [[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Supergroup]], and '''K''' the [[Karoo Supergroup]]. The graph also indicates the period during which [[Banded iron formation|banded ironstone formations]] were formed on earth, indicative of an [[Great Oxygenation Event|oxygen-free atmosphere]]. The Earth's crust was wholly or partially molten during the [[Hadean]] Eon. One of the first microcontinents to form was the [[Kaapvaal Craton]], which is exposed at the centre of the Vredefort Dome, and again north of [[Johannesburg]].]]

The [[dome (geology)|dome]] in the centre of the crater was originally thought to have been formed by a [[volcano|volcanic]] explosion, but in the mid-1990s, evidence revealed it was the site of a huge bolide impact, as telltale [[shatter cone]]s were discovered in the [[stream bed|bed]] of the nearby [[Vaal River]].

The crater site is one of the few multiple-ringed [[impact crater]]s on Earth, although they are more common elsewhere in the [[Solar System]]. Perhaps the best-known example is [[Valhalla (crater)|Valhalla crater]] on [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], although Earth's [[Moon]] has a number, as well. Geological processes, such as [[erosion]] and [[plate tectonics]], have destroyed most multiple-ring craters on Earth.

The present erosion level is shown. [[Johannesburg]] is located where the [[Witwatersrand Basin]] (the yellow layer) is exposed at the "present surface" line, just inside the crater rim, on the left. Not to scale.]] 
The impact distorted the [[Witwatersrand Basin]] which was laid down over a period of 250&amp;nbsp;million years between 950 and 700&amp;nbsp;million years before the Vredefort impact. The overlying Ventersdorp lavas and the [[Transvaal Basin|Transvaal Supergroup]] which were laid down between 700 and 80&amp;nbsp;million years before the meteorite strike, were similarly distorted by the formation of the {{convert|300|km|mi|adj=mid|-wide}} crater.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Norman &gt;Norman, N., Whitfield, G. (2006) ‘’Geological Journeys’’. p. 38-49, 60-61. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.&lt;/ref&gt; These rocks form partial concentric rings round the crater centre today, with the oldest, the [[Witwatersrand]] rocks, forming a semicircle 25&amp;nbsp;km from the centre. Since the Witwatersrand rocks consist of several layers of very hard, erosion resistant sediments (e.g. [[quartzite]]s and [[Banded iron formations|banded ironstones]]),&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truswell, J.F. (1977). ''The Geological Evolution of South Africa''. pp. 23-38. Purnell, Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt; they form the prominent arc of hills that can be seen to the NW of the crater centre in the satellite picture above. The Witwatersrand rocks are followed, in succession, by the Ventersdorp lavas at a distance of about 35&amp;nbsp;km from the centre, and the [[Transvaal Basin|Transvaal Supergroup]], consisting of a narrow band of the Ghaap [[Dolomite]] rocks and the [[Transvaal Basin|Pretoria Subgroup]] of rocks, which together form a 25- to 30-kilometre-wide band beyond that.&lt;ref name="geological map"&gt;Geological map of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (1970). Council for Geoscience, Geological Survey of South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; 
From about halfway through the Pretoria Subgroup of rocks around the crater centre, the order of the rocks is reversed. Moving outwards towards where the crater rim used to be, the Ghaap [[Dolomite]] group resurfaces at 60&amp;nbsp;km from the centre, followed by an arc of Ventersdorp lavas, beyond which, at between 80 and 120&amp;nbsp;km from the centre, the Witwatersrand rocks re-emerge to form an interrupted arc of outcrops today, of which the [[Johannesburg]] group is the most famous, because it was here that gold was discovered in 1886.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt;&lt;ref name="geological map" /&gt; It is thus possible that if it had not been for the Vredefort impact this gold would never have been discovered.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt;

The {{convert|40|km|mi|adj=mid|-diameter}} centre of the Vredefort crater consists of a granite dome (where it is not covered by much younger rocks belonging to the [[Karoo Supergroup]]) which is an exposed part of the [[Kaapvaal craton]], one of the oldest microcontinents which formed on Earth 3,900&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; This central [[Peak ring (crater)|peak]] uplift, or dome, is typical of a complex [[impact crater]], where the liquefied rocks splashed up in the wake of the meteor as it penetrated the surface.

==Conservation==
[[Image:Vredefort crater.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Monochrome satellite view of the crater]]
The Vredefort Dome World Heritage Site is currently subject to property development, and local owners have expressed concern regarding sewage dumping into the Vaal River and the crater site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The granting of prospecting rights around the edges of the crater has led environmental interests to express fear of destructive mining.

==Community==

The Vredefort Dome in the centre of the crater is home to four towns, namely [[Parys]], [[Vredefort]], [[Koppies]] and [[Venterskroon]]. Parys is the largest and a tourist hub; both Vredefort and Koppies mainly depend on an agricultural economy.

On 19 December 2011, a broadcasting license was granted by ICASA to a community radio station to broadcast for the Afrikaans- and English-speaking members of the communities within the crater. The Afrikaans name ''Koepel'' Stereo (Dome Stereo) refers to the dome and announces its broadcast as KSFM. The station broadcasts on 94.9&amp;nbsp;MHz FM.
