[[File:Ablation of quartz glass in a flashtube.jpg|thumb|200px|Ablation near the electrode in a [[flashtube]]. The high-energy electrical arc slowly erodes the glass, leaving a frosted appearance.]]
'''Ablation''' is removal of material from the surface of an object by [[vaporization]], chipping, or other [[erosion|erosive]] processes. Examples of ablative materials are described below, and include [[spacecraft]] material for ascent and [[atmospheric reentry]], ice and snow in [[glaciology]], biological tissues in [[medicine]] and [[passive fire protection]] materials.

==Biology==

'''Biological ablation''' is the removal of a biological structure or functionality.

Genetic ablation is another term for [[gene silencing]], in which [[gene expression]] is abolished through the alteration or deletion of [[genetic sequence]] information. In cell ablation, individual cells in a population or culture are destroyed or removed. Both can be used as experimental tools, as in [[loss-of-function]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changbioscience.com/res/res/rCellsAblation.htm Cell Ablation definition], Change Bioscience.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glaciology==
{{further|Ablation zone}}
In glaciology and [[meteorology]], ablation—the opposite of accumulation—refers to all processes that remove snow, ice, or water from a glacier or snowfield.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, W. S. B. 1999. ''The Physics of Glaciers''. Tarrytown, N.Y., Pergamon.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}} Ablation refers to the melting of snow or ice that runs off the glacier, [[evaporation]], [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], [[Ice calving|calving]], or erosive removal of snow by wind.  Air temperature is typically the dominant control of ablation, with precipitation exercising secondary control. In a temperate climate during ablation season, ablation rates typically average around 2&amp;nbsp;mm/h.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=ablation&amp;submit=Search |title=''Glossary of Meteorology'' |access-date=2010-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917232831/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=ablation&amp;submit=Search |archive-date=2011-09-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where solar radiation is the dominant cause of snow ablation (e.g., if air temperatures are low under clear skies), characteristic ablation textures such as [[Suncup (snow)|suncups]] and [[Penitente (snow formation)|penitentes]] may develop on the snow surface.&lt;ref name=Betterton&gt;Betterton, M. D. "Theory of structure formation in snowfields motivated by penitentes, suncups, and dirt cones". ''Physical Review E'' 63.5 (2001): 056129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ablation can refer either to the processes removing ice and snow or to the quantity of ice and snow removed.

Debris-covered glaciers have also been shown to greatly impact the ablation process. There is a thin debris layer that can be located on the top of glaciers that intensifies the ablation process below the ice. The debris-covered parts of a glacier that is experiencing ablation are sectioned into three categories which include ice cliffs, ponds, and debris. These three sections allow scientists to measure the heat digested by the debris-covered area and is calculated. The calculations are dependent on the area and net absorbed heat amounts in regards to the entire debris-covered zones. These types of calculations are done to various glaciers to understand and analyze future patterns of melting.&lt;ref&gt;Sakai, Akiko, et al. "Role of supraglacial ponds in the ablation process of a debris-covered glacier in the Nepal Himalayas." IAHS PUBLICATION (2000): 119-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moraine]] (glacial debris) is moved by natural processes that allow for down-slope movement of materials on the glacier body. It is noted that if the slope of a glacier is too high then the debris will continue to move along the glacier to a further location. The sizes and locations of glaciers vary around the world, so depending on the climate and physical geography the varieties of debris can differ. The size and magnitude of the debris is dependent on the area of glacier and can vary from dust-size fragments to blocks as large as a house.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Frank, Christian Huggel, and Andreas Kääb. "Combining satellite multispectral image data and a digital elevation model for mapping debris-covered glaciers." Remote sensing of Environment 89.4 (2004): 510-518.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been many experiments done to demonstrate the effect of debris on the surface of glaciers. Yoshiyuki Fujii, a professor at the [[National Institute of Polar Research]] designed an experiment that showed ablation rate was accelerated under a thin debris layer and was retarded under a thick one as compared with that of a natural snow surface.&lt;ref&gt;Fujii, Yoshiyuki. "Field experiment on glacier ablation under a layer of debris cover." Journal of the Japanese Society of Snow and Ice 39.Special (1977): 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; This science is significant due to the importance of long-term availability of water resources and assess glacier response to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Kayastha, Rijan Bhakta, et al. "Practical prediction of ice melting beneath various thickness of debris cover on Khumbu Glacier, Nepal, using a positive degree-day factor." IAHS PUBLICATION 7182 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Natural resource availability is a major drive behind research conducted in regards to the ablation process and overall study of glaciers.

==Laser ablation==
{{main article|laser ablation}}
[[Image:SSY1 Military Surplus Nd-YAG Laser Firing.JPG|thumb|250px|An [[Nd:YAG]] laser drills a hole through a block of [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile]]. The intense burst of infrared radiation ablates the highly absorbing rubber, releasing an eruption of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].]][[Laser ablation]] is greatly affected by the nature of the material and its ability to absorb energy, therefore the wavelength of the ablation laser should have a minimum absorption depth.  While these lasers can average a low power, they can offer peak intensity and fluence given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       \text{Intensity } (\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{cm}^2) &amp;= \frac{\text{average power } (\mathrm{W})}{\text{focal spot area } (\mathrm{cm}^2)} \\[5pt]
  \text{Peak intensity } (\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{cm}^2) &amp;= \frac{\text{peak power } (\mathrm{W})}{\text{focal spot area } (\mathrm{cm}^2)} \\[5pt]
         \text{Fluence } (\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{cm}^2) &amp;= \frac{\text{laser pulse energy } (\mathrm{J})}{\text{focal spot area } (\mathrm{cm}^2)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

while the peak power is

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Peak power } (\mathrm{W}) = \frac{\text{pulse energy } (\mathrm{J})}{\text{pulse duration } (\mathrm{s})}&lt;/math&gt;

Surface ablation of the [[cornea]] for several types of eye [[refractive surgery]] is now common, using an [[excimer laser]] system ([[LASIK]] and [[LASEK]]). Since the cornea does not grow back, laser is used to remodel the cornea [[refraction|refractive]] properties to correct [[refraction error]]s, such as [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]], [[myopia]], and [[hyperopia]]. Laser ablation is also used to remove part of the [[uterus|uterine]] wall in women with [[menstruation]] and [[adenomyosis]] problems in a process called [[endometrial ablation]].

Recently, researchers have demonstrated a successful technique for ablating subsurface tumors with minimal thermal damage to surrounding healthy tissue, by using a focused laser beam from an ultra-short pulse diode laser source.&lt;ref&gt;Amir Yousef Sajjadi, Kunal Mitra, Michael Grace, "Ablation of subsurface tumors using an ultra-short pulse laser", ''Optics and Lasers in Engineering'', Volume 49, Issue 3, March 2011, Pages 451–456, ISSN 0143-8166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine surface coatings==
[[Biofouling#Anti-fouling|Antifouling]] paints and other related coatings are routinely used to prevent the buildup of [[microorganisms]] and other animals, such as [[barnacle]]s for the bottom hull surfaces of recreational, commercial and military sea vessels. Ablative paints are often utilized for this purpose to prevent the dilution or deactivation of the antifouling agent.  Over time, the paint will slowly decompose in the water, exposing fresh antifouling compounds on the surface. Engineering the antifouling agents and the ablation rate can produce long-lived protection from the deleterious effects of biofouling.

==Medicine==

In medicine, ablation is the same as removal of a part of [[biological tissue]], usually by [[surgery]]. Surface ablation of the [[skin]] ([[dermabrasion]], also called resurfacing because it induces [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]]) can be carried out by chemicals (chemoablation), by lasers ([[laser ablation]]), by freezing ([[cryoablation]]), or by electricity ([[fulguration]]). Its purpose is to remove skin spots, [[aging|aged skin]], [[wrinkles]], thus [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenating]] it. Surface ablation is also employed in [[otolaryngology]] for several kinds of surgery, such as for [[snoring]]. Ablation therapy using radio frequency waves on the heart is used to cure a variety of cardiac arrhythmiae such as [[supraventricular tachycardia]], [[Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome]] (WPW), ventricular tachycardia, and more recently as [[management of atrial fibrillation]]. The term is often used in the context of [[laser ablation]], a process in which a [[laser]] dissolves a material's [[covalent bond|molecular bonds]].  For a laser to ablate tissues, the power density or [[fluence]] must be high, otherwise thermocoagulation occurs, which is simply thermal vaporization of the tissues.

Rotoablation is a type of arterial cleansing that consists of inserting a tiny, diamond-tipped, drill-like device into the affected artery to remove fatty deposits or plaque. The procedure is used in the treatment of [[coronary heart disease]] to restore blood flow.

[[Radiofrequency ablation]] (RFA) is a method of removing aberrant tissue from within the body via minimally invasive procedures.

[[Microwave ablation]] (MWA) is similar to RFA but at higher frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.

[[Bone marrow]] ablation is a process whereby the human bone marrow cells are eliminated in preparation for a [[bone marrow transplant]]. This is performed using high-intensity [[chemotherapy]] and [[total body irradiation]]. As such, it has nothing to do with the vaporization techniques described in the rest of this article.

[[Ablative brain surgery|Ablation of brain tissue]] is used for treating certain [[neurological disorder]]s, particularly [[Parkinson's disease]], and sometimes for [[psychiatric disorder]]s as well.

Recently, some researchers reported successful results with genetic ablation. In particular, genetic ablation is potentially a much more efficient method of removing unwanted cells, such as [[tumor]] cells, because large numbers of animals lacking specific cells could be generated. Genetically ablated lines can be maintained for a prolonged period of time and shared within the research community. Researchers at Columbia University report of reconstituted [[caspases]] combined from ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' and humans, which maintain a high degree of target specificity. The genetic ablation techniques described could prove useful in battling cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Targeted cell killing by reconstituted caspases |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |first1=Dattananda S. |last1=Chelur |author2=Chalfie, Martin |volume=104 |issue=7 |pages=2283–8 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/104/7/2283 |accessdate=2007-03-08 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0610877104 |pmid=17283333 |pmc=1892955 |bibcode=2007PNAS..104.2283C |date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passive fire protection==
[[Firestop]]ping and [[fireproofing]] products can be ablative in nature. This can mean [[endothermic]] materials, or merely materials that are sacrificial and become "spent" over time while exposed to [[fire]], such as [[silicone]] firestop products.
Given sufficient time under fire or heat conditions, these products char away, crumble, and disappear. The idea is to put enough of this material in the way of the fire that a level of [[fire-resistance rating]] can be maintained, as demonstrated in a [[fire test]]. Ablative materials usually have a large concentration of organic matter{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} that is reduced by fire to ashes. In the case of silicone, organic [[rubber]] surrounds very finely divided [[silica]] [[dust]] (up to 380 m² of combined surface area of all the dust particles per gram of this dust{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}). When the organic rubber is exposed to fire, it burns to ash and leaves behind the silica dust with which the product started.

==Spaceflight==
{{main article|atmospheric reentry#Ablative}}
In [[spacecraft]] design, ablation is used to both cool and protect mechanical parts and/or payloads that would otherwise be damaged by extremely high temperatures.  Two principal applications are [[heat shield]]s for spacecraft entering a [[Atmosphere|planetary atmosphere]] from space and cooling of [[rocket engine nozzle]]s.   Examples include the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo Command Module]] that protected astronauts from the [[heat]] of [[atmospheric reentry]] and the [[Kestrel (rocket engine)|Kestrel]] [[multistage rocket|second stage]] [[rocket engine]] designed for exclusive use in an environment of [[Outer space#Environment|space vacuum]] since no [[Convection|heat convection]] is possible.

In a basic sense, ablative material is designed to slowly burn away in a controlled manner, so that heat can be carried away from the spacecraft by the gases generated by the ablative process while the remaining solid material insulates the craft from superheated gases. There is an entire branch of [[spaceflight]] research involving the search for new [[fireproofing]] materials to achieve the best ablative performance;  this function is critical to protect the spacecraft occupants and payload from otherwise excessive heat loading.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Parker (scientist)|Parker, John]] and C. Michael Hogan, "Techniques for Wind Tunnel assessment of Ablative Materials", NASA Ames Research Center, Technical Publication, August 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same technology is used in some [[passive fire protection]] applications, in some cases by the same vendors, who offer different versions of these [[fireproofing]] products, some for aerospace and some for structural [[fire protection]].

An '''adduct''' (from the Latin ''adductus'', "drawn toward" alternatively, a contraction of "addition product") is a product of a [[Addition reaction|direct addition]] of two or more distinct molecules, resulting in a single reaction product containing all atoms of all components.&lt;ref&gt;{{ GoldBookRef | file = A00138 | title = adduct }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant is considered a distinct molecular species. Examples include the addition of [[sodium bisulfite]] to an [[aldehyde]] to give a [[sulfonate]]. It can just be considered as a single product resulting from direct addition of different molecules and constitutes all the reactant molecules' atoms.

Adducts often form between [[Lewis acid]]s and [[Lewis base]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Housecroft |first1=Catherine E. |last2=Sharpe |first2=Alan G. |title=Inorganic Chemistry |page=199 |chapter=Acids, bases and ions in aqueous solution |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |location=Harlow, Essex |isbn=978-0-13-175553-6 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example is the formation of adducts between the Lewis acid [[borane]] and the oxygen atom in the Lewis bases, [[tetrahydrofuran]] (THF): BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·O(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or [[diethyl ether]]: BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·O(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Compounds or mixtures that cannot form an adduct because of [[steric hindrance]] are called [[frustrated Lewis pair]]s.

Adducts are not necessarily molecular in nature. A good example from [[solid-state chemistry]] is&lt;!--Predicate agrees with its subject!--&gt; the adducts of ethylene or carbon monoxide of CuAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The latter is a solid with an extended lattice structure. Upon formation of the adduct, a new extended phase is formed in which the gas molecules are incorporated (inserted) as [[ligand]]s of the copper atoms within the structure. This reaction can also be considered a reaction between a base and a Lewis acid with the copper atom in the electron-receiving role and the [[pi electron]]s of the gas molecule in the electron-donating role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Capracotta, M.

==Adduct ions==
An adduct ion is formed from a precursor ion and contains all of the constituent atoms of that ion as well as additional atoms or molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | file = A00139 | title = adduct ion (in mass spectrometry)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adduct ions are often formed in a [[mass spectrometer]] ion source.

[[File:Airport Carbon Accreditation logo.svg|thumb|Logo of the programme]]
''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' is a global carbon management programme for airports that independently assesses and recognises airports’ efforts to manage and reduce their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. There are 4 different levels of accreditation: Mapping, Reduction, Optimisation and Neutrality;

The programme was launched by European airports' trade body [[Airports Council International Europe|ACI EUROPE]] at their Annual Congress in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airportcarbonaccreditation.org/component/downloads/downloads/27.html|title=Europe’s airports announce bold ambitions towards carbon neutrality|last=ACI EUROPE|first=|date=16 June 2009|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is independently administered by [[WSP Global|WSP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wsp-pb.com/|title=We are WSP|work=WSP Group|access-date=2017-05-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; an international consultancy firm. The programme provides airports with a common framework for active carbon management with measurable goal-posts. Individual airport carbon footprints are independently verified in accordance with [[ISO 14064]] (Greenhouse Gas Accounting) on the basis of supporting evidence. Claims regarding airports' carbon management processes are also independently verified by a group of 117 independent verifiers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airportcarbonaccreditation.org/airport/verification.html|title=Airport Carbon Accreditation - Independent Third Party Verification|last=Rebelo|first=Ines|website=www.airportcarbonaccreditation.org|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in 36 countries.

== 4 Levels of the programme ==

•	The 'Mapping' level of ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' (Level 1) requires carbon footprint measurement.

•	The 'Reduction' level of ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' (Level 2) requires carbon management and progress towards a reduced carbon footprint.

•	The 'Optimisation' level of ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' (Level 3) requires third party engagement in carbon footprint reduction. Third parties include [[airline]]s and various service providers, for example, independent [[Aircraft ground handling|ground handlers]], catering companies, [[air traffic control]] and others working on the airport site. It also involves engagement on surface access modes (road, rail) with authorities and users.

•	The 'Neutrality' level of ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' (Level 3+) requires neutralising remaining direct carbon emissions by [[Carbon offset|offsetting]]. The first airport to ever achieve carbon neutrality was the [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport|Stockholm-Arlanda Airport]] in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.airport-business.com/2012/11/swedavia-becomes-worlds-first-carbon-neutral-national-airport-group/|title=Swedavia becomes world’s first carbon neutral national airport group {{!}} Airport Business|date=2012-11-23|work=Airport Business|access-date=2017-05-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Official endorsements ==

The initiative is a direct consequence of the resolution on Climate Change adopted in June 2008 by the ACI EUROPE annual assembly,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aci-europe.org/component/downloads/downloads/345.html|title=European airports actively engaging on reducing CO2, despite the crisis|last=ACI EUROPE|first=|date=19 June 2008|website=|access-date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been endorsed by both the [[European Civil Aviation Conference]] and [[Eurocontrol|EUROCONTROL]]. The administration of ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' is overseen by an independent Advisory Board, members of which include representatives of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), [[European Civil Aviation Conference]] (ECAC), the [[European Commission]], [[Eurocontrol|EUROCONTROL]], [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) and [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]. On 30 November 2011 it was announced that the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) was also formally supporting the programme, and taking a seat on the independent advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aci-europe.org/component/downloads/downloads/3088.html|title=ICAO supports European airport CO2 programme as it extends to Asia-Pacific|last=ACI EUROPE|first=|date=30 November 2011|website=|access-date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to European Commission participation on the Advisory Board, the then European Commission Vice President responsible for Transport [[Siim Kallas]] has strongly supported the scheme, participating in the presentation of accreditation certificates at several European Airports, including [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Charles de Gaulle]], [[Orly Airport|Orly]], [[Brussels Airport|Brussels]] and [[Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport|Budapest]] Airports. He has also stated that he believes the initiative ''is playing a crucial role in helping move European aviation onto a more sustainable footing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aci-europe.org/component/downloads/downloads/2764.html|title=Paris airports’ CO2 achievements newly Airport Carbon Accredited|last=ACI EUROPE|first=|date=6 December 2010|website=|access-date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carbon standard ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' going global ==

The programme has expanded beyond Europe on 30 November 2011, having been formally extended to the Asia-Pacific region at ACI Airport Exchange conference in Abu Dhabi, organised by ACI ASIA-PACIFIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airport-business.com/2012/03/momentum-carries-airport-carbon-accreditation-beyond-europe/|title=Momentum carries Airport Carbon Accreditation beyond Europe|last=ACI EUROPE|first=|date=30 March 2012|website=|access-date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first airport to become accredited within this region was [[Abu Dhabi International Airport]] which achieved 'Mapping' level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabianaerospace.aero/aci-abu-dhabi-first-in-region-to-receive-airport-carbon-accreditation.html|title=Arabian Aerospace - ACI: Abu Dhabi first in region to receive Airport Carbon Accreditation|website=www.arabianaerospace.aero|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, 38 airports from the region joined the community of accredited airports. 
The programme was further extended with the African region of ACI joining the community in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.airport-world.com/news/general-news/2762-carbon-neutral-airports-scheme-to-be-rolled-out-in-africa|title=Carbon neutral airports scheme to be rolled out in Africa - Airport World Magazine|last=Thompson|first=Steven|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch of ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' in Africa was coupled with the official certification of the first African airport to the programme, [[Enfidha–Hammamet International Airport|Enfidha-Hammamet International Airport]] in Tunisia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airportcarbonaccreditation.org/component/downloads/downloads/33.html|title=Airport Carbon Accreditation – active in 3 continents|last=ACI EUROPE|first=|date=12 June 2013|website=|access-date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was certified at the 'Mapping' level. 
In June 2014, at ACI EUROPE’s Annual Congress in Frankfurt the ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' programme celebrated two important milestones in its story:  its 5th anniversary together with crossing the threshold of 100 airports participating in the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenaironline.com/news.php?viewStory=1939|title=With 102 airports on four continents, airport carbon programme looks to expand geographical reach on GreenAir Online|website=www.greenaironline.com|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, in fall 2014, the programme became global,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airportcarbonaccredited.org/component/downloads/downloads/66.html|title=Carbon standard for the airport industry goes global|last=ACI EUROPE|first=|date=14 November 2014|website=|access-date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its official launch in North America, followed by its introduction in the region of Latin America and the Caribbean. Having already achieved significant results in 5 continents, the launch of ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' in this region, in partnership with ACI Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, marked the decisive moment when the programme became the global standard for carbon management at airports.

In 2015, a new interactive website – [http://www.airportco2.org/ www.airportco2.org] – was launched at the end of Year 6 of ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' – the year of the global expansion of the programme. This microsite was created to promote the programme in more accessible language and to communicate the annual results achieved by participating airports. It continues to present key figures from the programme, both globally and per region, in a more visual and engaging way.

== Airport Carbon Accreditation at Paris Sustainable Innovation Forum (COP21) ==

The [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21]] Conference in Paris in December 2015 was an important milestone for the ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' programme. On the occasion of its presentation at the Conference, the European airport industry committed to increasing the number of carbon neutral airports to 50 by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airportcarbonaccreditation.org/component/downloads/downloads/88.html.html|title=European airport industry pledges 50 carbon neutral airports by 2030|last=ACI EUROPE|first=|date=2 December 2015|website=|access-date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement of this commitment, ACI EUROPE and the carbon standard ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' signed a partnership with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), at a special side event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airportcarbonaccreditation.org/component/downloads/downloads/87.html.html|title=UNFCCC and ACI join forces to promote carbon neutral and sustainable airports|last=ACI EUROPE|first=|date=8 December 2015|website=|access-date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership agreement committed ACI to supporting the UNFCCC’s ‘[http://climateneutralnow.org/Pages/Home.aspx Climate Neutral Now]’  campaign, while the UNFCCC would support airport climate action at airports, with a particular focus on carbon management by airports through ''Airport Carbon Accreditation''. The organisations agreed also to develop a common work programme and communications plan promoting carbon neutrality at airports.

== European airports commit to 100 carbon neutral airports by 2030 ==
In June 2017, at ACI EUROPE's 27th Annual Congress, European airports made a new pledge, doubling the one made during COP21.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aci-europe.org/component/downloads/downloads/5105.html|title=European airports double their pledge: 100 carbon neutral airports by 2030|last=ACI EUROPE|first=|date=13 June 2017|work=|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They committed to 100 carbon neutral airports by 2030. Over 20 airport operator companies signed the new commitment, among which: Groupe ADP, AENA, [[Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport|Aeroporto di Bologna]], Aeroport Brest Bretagne, Aeroports de la Côte d'Azur, [[Bristol Airport]], [[Brussels Airport]], [[Finavia]], [[Heathrow Airport]], [[London City Airport]], [[Geneva Airport]], [[Munich Airport]], Aeroporto Internazionale di Napoli, Aeroport Quimper Bretagne, [[Schiphol Group]] and [[Zürich Airport|Zurich Airport]].

== Awards and recognition ==

The ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' programme has gathered a number of notable climate-action awards. In 2013, the programme reached Top 3 in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130912141437/http://world-you-like.europa.eu/en/ World You Like] competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airportcarbonaccreditation.org/component/downloads/downloads/45.html|title=Airport industry’s carbon reduction programme named among top 3 low carbon projects in Europe|last=ACI EUROPE|first=|date=8 November 2014|website=|access-date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a contest in which businesses, NGOs and local authorities can participate by showcasing their climate-friendly solutions, run by the European Commission's [[Directorate-General for Climate Action]]. The ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' programme was chosen out of 269 low carbon projects in Europe – and the only transport project in the Top 3. It was recognised as an efficient and innovative climate solution that is making a real difference in helping airports address their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. 
In May 2014, the airport industry’s efforts to address its carbon emissions received the Highly Commended prize at the annual global [[International Transport Forum]] (ITF) Awards issued by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airportcarbonaccreditation.org/component/downloads/downloads/116.html|title=Airport industry’s carbon reduction programme commended by OECD’s International Transport Forum contest|last=ACI EUROPE|first=|date=14 May 2014|website=|access-date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voluntary climate change initiative ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' was named as one of two runners-up for the ITF’s Transport Achievement Award.

Only a month later, in June 2015, the animation [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJWDJx-aaFE “Life is about Movement”], created to highlight the essence of the programme, was awarded the Gold Totem prize in the “Businesses &amp; Eco-Performances” category at the 4th Deauville Green Awards 2015.

In 2016, ''Airport Carbon Accreditation'' was featured in the first ever [https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/european-aviation-environmental-report-2016-72dpi.pdf European Aviation Environmental Report], published by the European Commission, in very positive terms as one of the innovative initiatives of the airport industry to tackle environmental challenges.

== Current state of play ==

As of 2017, 192 airports across the world are certified at one of the 4 levels of Airport Carbon Accreditation. These airports handle 2.7 billion passengers a year, 38.4% of global air passenger traffic. 35 airports are carbon neutral – the latest to reach this level was [[Helsinki Airport]]. There are now 28 carbon neutral airports in Europe, 5 in Asia, 1 in North America and 1 in Africa.

=== Europe ===

In Europe, there are now 116 airports participating in the programme, 51 of which are at the top 2 levels of the programme. [[Helsinki Airport]] was the latest airports to reach carbon neutrality in the region. The other recent movers within the programme are Düsseldorf and Naples airports – each of which successfully make the jump from Level 2 Reduction, to Level 3 Optimisation. [[Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport|Madeira]], [[Marseille Provence Airport|Marseille]] and [[Porto Santo Airport|Porto Santo]] airports have moved up to Level 2 Reduction while Switzerland’s [[Bern Airport]] became the latest newcomer in Europe, entering the programme at Level 1 Mapping.

=== Asia-pacific  ===

There are now 38 airports certified in Asia-Pacific with recent entrants including [[Gold Coast Airport]] and [[Hobart International Airport|Hobart International]] (both in Australia) as well as [[Muscat International Airport]] and [[Nadi International Airport]] (Fiji) – which have all started their journey to active carbon management, becoming accredited at Level 1 Mapping. [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport|Mumbai International Airport]] and [[Kempegowda International Airport|Bangalore International Airport]] are the latest airports to become carbon neutral in the region.

=== Africa===

Recent months have seen several new airports come on board, nearly doubling the participation on the African continent. [[Cape Town International Airport|Cape Town International]], [[King Shaka International Airport|King Shaka International]] (Durban), Port Elizabeth International and [[O. R. Tambo International Airport|O.R. Tambo International]] (Johannesburg) – 4 airports in South Africa have all successfully entered the programme at Level 1 Mapping. This brings the total number of African airports in the programme up to 9.

Another key development was the successful upgrade of Felix Houphouet Boigny International Airport (Abidjan) to Level 3+ Carbon Neutrality. This is the first African airport to ever scale this high in the Airport Carbon Accreditation scheme.

=== North America ===

It’s been two and a half years since the programme was launched in North America, and 23 airports have become certified in this region. The latest entry was made by [[Van Nuys Airport]]. In all, the 23 certified airports in the North America region currently account for 32.6% of air passenger traffic in North America.

=== Latin America &amp; caribbean ===

There are currently 6 certified airports in the region of Latin American and Caribbean. The latest entrants are [[José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport|Guayaquil Airport]] in Ecuador and [[El Dorado International Airport|El Dorado Airport]] in Columbia. 4 of them at Level 1 Mapping, and the other 2 actively reducing their emissions, certified at Level 2 Reduction.

== Counting the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction ==
Airport emissions have been reduced by 55,633 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in Year 1 of the programme and 55,501 tonnes in Year 2, and 77,782 tonnes in Year 3 as a result. Year 4 of the programme had a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction of 110,003 tonnes - enough to power 45,949 households for a year.

If 31,894 cars were removed from the roads for one year, it would enable a reduction close to the one achieved by ''Airport Carbon Accreditation''’s participants in Year 5.

From July 2014 to June 2015, the programme has allowed a reduction comparable to the annual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestered by 1,496 acres of forest. We could have powered almost twice as many households as compared to the year 4 result in the sixth consecutive year of the programme. Following years are bound to beat these figures, with a number of accredited airports at high levels rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airportco2.org/equivalents.html|title=Counting the CO2 reduction|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129104400/http://airportco2.org/equivalents.html|archivedate=2016-01-29|dead-url=yes|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and [[Mediterranean climate]]s throughout the world.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; They have a green-skinned, fleshy body that may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped, or spherical. Commercially, they ripen after harvesting. Avocado trees are partially [[Self-pollination|self-pollinating]] and are often [[Plant propagation|propagated]] through [[grafting]] to maintain a predictable quality and quantity of the fruit.

The plant was introduced to Spain in 1601, Indonesia around 1750, Mauritius in 1780, Brazil in 1809, the United States mainland in 1825, South Africa and Australia in the late 19th century, and Israel in 1908.&lt;ref name="Schaffer 2013"/&gt; In the United States, the avocado was introduced to Florida and Hawaii in 1833 and in California in 1856.&lt;ref name="Schaffer 2013"/&gt;

Before 1915, the avocado was commonly referred to in California as ''ahuacate'' and in Florida as ''alligator pear''. In 1915, the [[California Avocado Society|California Avocado Association]] introduced the then-innovative term ''avocado'' to refer to the plant.&lt;ref name="Schaffer 2013"/&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word "avocado" comes from the Spanish ''aguacate'', which in turn comes from the [[Nahuatl]] word ''āhuacatl'' {{IPA-nah|aːˈwakat͡ɬ|}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://whp.uoregon.edu/dictionaries/nahuatl/index.lasso Nahuatl Dictionary/Diccionario del náhuatl]. Whp.uoregon.edu. Retrieved on 2013-07-25.&lt;/ref&gt; which goes back to the proto-Aztecan ''*pa:wa'' which also meant "avocado".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dakin, Karen |year=1982 |title=La evolución fonológica del Protonáhuatl |publisher=[[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]], Instituto de Investigaciones Filológicas |location=México D.F. |isbn=968-5802-92-0 |oclc=10216962|page=210|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the Nahuatl word was used with the meaning "testicle", probably because of the likeness between the fruit and the body part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=avocado&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern English name comes from an English rendering of the Spanish ''aguacate'' as ''avogato''. The earliest known written use in English is attested from 1697 as "avogato pear", a term which was later corrupted as "alligator pear".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', second edition (1989), articles "avocado", "alligator, n.2"&lt;/ref&gt; Because the word ''avogato'' sounded like "advocate", several languages reinterpreted it to have that meaning. French uses ''avocat'', which also means ''lawyer'', and "advocate"-forms of the word appear in several Germanic languages, such as the (now obsolete) German ''Advogato-Birne'', the old Danish ''advokat-pære'' (today it is called "avocado") and the Dutch ''advocaatpeer''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Svenska Akademiens ordbok]]'', "[http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=1/2/5.html#ADVOKAT-P%C3%84RON advokat]"; ''[[Ordbog over det danske Sprog]]'', "[http://ordnet.dk/ods/ordbog?query=Avocado avocado]"; ''[[Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal]]'', "[http://gtb.inl.nl/iWDB/search?actie=article&amp;wdb=WNT&amp;id=A000250&amp;lemmodern=avocado avocado]", all meaning "advocate pear".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional names ===
In other Central American and Caribbean Spanish-speaking countries, it is known by the Mexican name, while South American Spanish-speaking countries use a [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]-derived word, ''palta''. In Portuguese, it is ''abacate''. The fruit is sometimes called an avocado pear or alligator pear (due to its shape and the rough green skin of some [[cultivar]]s).&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; The Nahuatl ''ahuacatl'' can be compounded with other words, as in ''ahuacamolli'', meaning avocado soup or sauce, from which the Spanish word ''[[guacamole]]'' derives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefloweringgarden.com/avocado.htm |title=Avocado |publisher=Thefloweringgarden.com |date=2007-08-08 |accessdate=2010-05-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100510170336/http://www.thefloweringgarden.com/avocado.htm| archivedate= 10 May 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the term "avocado pear" is still sometimes misused as applied when avocados first became commonly available in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=scotsman&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/twiggy-squares-up-to-sainsbury-s-in-the-avocado-wars-1-1352962 |title=Twiggy squares up to Sainsbury's in the avocado wars |date=23 May 2009 |work=[[The Scotsman]] |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originating as a [[diminutive in Australian English]], a [[clipping (morphology)|clipped]] form, "avo", has since become a common colloquialism in South Africa and the United Kingdom.

It is known as "butter fruit" in parts of India and goes by the name "bơ" [ɓɘː] in Vietnamese, which is the same word that is used for butter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.hindu.com/2010/04/16/stories/2010041656650300.htm |title=Avocado holds promise for Wayanad farmers|date=2010-04-16|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In eastern China, it is known as ''è lí'' ("alligator pear") or ''niú yóu guǒ'' ("butter fruit"). In Taiwan, it is known as ''luò lí'' or "cheese pear".

==Botany==
[[File:Avocado Seedling.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Persea americana'', young avocado plant (seedling), complete with parted pit and roots]]

The tree grows to {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with alternately arranged [[leaf|leaves]] {{convert|12|-|25|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long. The [[flower]]s are inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, {{convert|5|-|10|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide.

== Cultivation ==

The [[subtropical]] species needs a climate without frost and with little wind. High winds reduce the humidity, dehydrate the flowers, and affect pollination. When even a mild frost occurs, premature fruit drop may occur, although the '[[Hass avocado|Hass]]' [[cultivar]] can tolerate temperatures down to −1&amp;nbsp;°C. Several cold-hardy varieties are planted in the region of [[Gainesville, Florida]], which survive temperatures as low as {{convert|−6.5|C|0}} with only minor leaf damage. The trees also need well-aerated soils, ideally more than 1 m deep. Yield is reduced when the irrigation water is highly [[salinity|saline]]. These soil and climate conditions are available in southern and eastern [[Spain]], Morocco, the Levant, South Africa, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, parts of central and northern Chile, Vietnam, Indonesia, parts of southern India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Central America, the Caribbean, Mexico, southern [[California]], [[Arizona]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Texas]], [[Florida]], [[Hawaii]], Ecuador, and Rwanda. Each region has different cultivars.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

=== Harvest and postharvest ===
Commercial orchards produce an average of seven tonnes per hectare each year, with some orchards achieving 20 tonnes per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6902e/x6902e04.htm |title = Avocado Production in Australia |last = Whiley|first = A|publisher = [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]]|date = 2000-09-01|accessdate = 2007-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080112135727/http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6902e/x6902e04.htm| archivedate= 12 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biennial bearing]] can be a problem, with heavy crops in one year being followed by poor yields the next.

Like the [[banana]], the avocado is a [[climacteric (botany)|climacteric]] fruit, which matures on the tree, but ripens off the tree. Avocados used in commerce are picked hard and green and kept in coolers at {{convert|3.3|to|5.6|C|F}} until they reach their final destination. Avocados must be mature to ripen properly. Avocados that fall off the tree ripen on the ground. Generally, the fruit is picked once it reaches maturity; Mexican growers pick 'Hass' avocados when they have more than 23% dry matter, and other producing countries have similar standards. Once picked, avocados ripen in one to two weeks (depending on the cultivar) at [[room temperature]] (faster if stored with other fruits such as apples or bananas, because of the influence of [[ethylene]] gas). Some [[supermarkets]] sell ripened avocados which have been treated with synthetic ethylene to hasten ripening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Ethylene-Gas.htm |title=Ethylene gas and produce |publisher=Mindfully.org |date=1976-06-01 |accessdate=2010-05-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100526120225/http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Ethylene-Gas.htm| archivedate= 26 May 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of an ethylene gas "ripening room", which is now an industry standard, was pioneered in the 1980s by farmer Gil Henry of [[Escondido, California]], in response to footage from a hidden supermarket camera which showed shoppers repeatedly squeezing hard, unripe avocados, putting them "back in the bin," and moving on without making a purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, avocados can be left on the tree for several months, which is an advantage to commercial growers who seek the greatest return for their crop, but if the fruit remains unpicked for too long, it falls to the ground.

=== Breeding ===
[[File:Seedless Avocado in Mexico.jpg|thumb|upright|A seedless avocado, or cuke, growing next to two regular avocados]]

The species is only partially able to [[self-pollination|self-pollinate]] because of [[dichogamy]] in its flowering. This limitation, added to the long juvenile period, makes the species difficult to breed. Most cultivars are propagated by [[grafting]], having originated from random seedling plants or minor [[mutation]]s derived from cultivars. Modern breeding programs tend to use isolation plots where the chances of cross-[[pollination]] are reduced. That is the case for programs at the [[University of California, Riverside]], as well as the [[Agricultural research In Israel#Agricultural Research Organization (ARO)|Volcani Centre]] and the Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias in [[Chile]].

The avocado is unusual in that the timing of the male and female flower phases differs among cultivars. The two flowering types are A and B. A-cultivar flowers open as female on the morning of the first day and close in late morning or early afternoon. Then they open as male in the afternoon of the second day. B varieties open as female on the afternoon of the first day, close in late afternoon and reopen as male the following morning.

Certain cultivars, such as the 'Hass', have a tendency to bear well only in alternate years. After a season with a low yield, due to factors such as cold (which the avocado does not tolerate well), the trees tend to produce abundantly the next season. In addition, due to environmental circumstances during some years, seedless avocados may appear on the trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soilzone.com/Library/Crops/Avocado/Phenology/Avocado%20fruit%20growth.pdf|title=Development of Seeded and Seedless Avocado Fruit|work=Agricultural Research Organization, Volcani Center, Bet-Dagan, Israel|author1=Blumenfeld, Amos|author2=Gazit, Shmuel|accessdate=2010-09-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125180713/http://soilzone.com/Library/Crops/Avocado/Phenology/Avocado%20fruit%20growth.pdf|archive-date=2014-01-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known in the avocado industry as "cukes", they are usually discarded commercially due to their small size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.avocadosource.com/CAS_Yearbooks/CAS_33_1948/CAS_1948_PG_113-116.pdf|journal=California Avocado Society 1948 Yearbook|author1=Stewart, W.S. |author2=Smoyer, K.M. |author3=Puffer, R.E. |title=Progress Report on Effects of Plant Growth Regulator Sprays on Avocados|accessdate=2010-09-21|volume=33|pages=113–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Propagation and rootstocks ===
[[File:GrowingAvocadoFromSeed.JPG|thumb|Avocado is usually [[sowing|treated]] with a special technique to assist its sprouting process]]
[[File:Persea americana (Avocado) Sprout 08May2010.JPG|thumb|upright|A young avocado sprout]]

Avocados can be propagated by seed, taking roughly four to six years to bear fruit, although in some cases seedlings can take 10 years to come into bearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boning|first=Charles|title=Florida's Best Fruiting Plants: Native and Exotic Trees, Shrubs, and Vines|year=2006|publisher=Pineapple Press, Inc.|location=Sarasota, Florida|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offspring is unlikely to be identical to the parent cultivar in fruit quality. Prime quality varieties are therefore propagated by grafting to [[rootstock]]s that are propagated by seed (seedling rootstocks) or by [[layering]] (clonal rootstocks). After about a year of growing in a greenhouse, the young rootstocks are ready to be grafted. Terminal and lateral grafting is normally used. The scion cultivar grows for another 6–12 months before the tree is ready to be sold. Clonal rootstocks are selected for tolerance of specific soil and disease conditions, such as poor soil aeration or resistance to the soil-borne disease (root rot) caused by ''[[Phytophthora]]''.

Commercial avocado production is limited to a small fraction of the vast genetic diversity in the species. Conservation of this genetic diversity has relied largely on field collection, as avocado seeds often do not survive storage in seed banks. This is problematic, as field preservation of living cultivars is expensive, and habitat loss threatens wild cultivars. More recently, an alternate method of conservation has been developed based on cryopreservation of avocado somatic embryos with reliable methods for somatic embryogenesis and reconstitution into living trees.&lt;ref&gt;O’Brien, Christopher, Jayeni CA Hiti-Bandaralage, Alice Hayward, and Neena Mitter. "Avocado (Persea americana Mill.)." In Step Wise Protocols for Somatic Embryogenesis of Important Woody Plants, pp. 305-328. Springer, Cham, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growing indoors ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Indoors, an avocado tree is usually grown from the [[Endocarp|pit]] of an avocado fruit. This is often done by removing the pit from a ripe, unrefrigerated avocado fruit. The pit is then stabbed with three or four toothpicks, about one-third of the way up from the flat end. The pit is placed in a jar or vase containing tepid water. It should split in four to six weeks and yield roots and a sprout. If there is no change by this time, the avocado pit is discarded. Once the stem has grown a few inches, it is placed in a pot with soil. It should be watered every few days. Avocados have been known to grow large, so owners must be ready to re-pot the plant several times.

=== Diseases ===
{{main article|List of avocado diseases}}

In Michoacán, the cultivation is complicated by the existence of [[drug cartel]]s that extort protection fees from cultivators. They are reported to exact 2000 Mexican pesos per hectare from avocado farmers and 1 to 3 pesos/kg of harvested fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aristeguinoticias.com/3010/mexico/templarios-ganan-2000-mdp-al-ano-extorsionando-a-aguacateros-en-michoacan/ |title=Templarios ganan 2,000 mdp al año extorsionando a aguacateros en Michoacán |trans-title=Templars earn 2,000 pesos a year extorting avocado in Michoacan |language=Spanish |publisher=Aristegui Noticias |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultivation in Peru ===
Hass avocado production in Peru encompasses thousands of hectares in central and western Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshplaza.com/article/129650/Peru-Record-avocado-production-saturated-the-markets-in-2014|title=Peru: Record avocado production saturated the markets in 2014|work=freshplaza.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peru has now become the largest supplier of avocados imported to the European Union and, more recently, has begun to export avocados in significant quantities to North America.

Peru's location near the equator and along the Pacific Ocean creates consistently mild temperatures year round. The soil is rich and sandy and the towering Andes mountains provide a constant flow of pure water for irrigation. Naturally sheltered as it is from heavy rain or freezing temperatures, Peru is an almost perfect climate for the cultivation of avocados.

Hass avocados from Peru are seasonally available to consumers from May through September and are promoted under the auspices of the Peruvian Avocado Commission, headquartered in Washington, D.C.

;[[Lula (avocado)|'Lula']]: A seedling reportedly grown from a 'Taft' avocado planted in Miami on the property of George Cellon, it is named after Cellon's wife, Lula. It was likely a cross between Mexican and Guatemalan types. 'Lula' was recognized for its flavor and high oil content and propagated commercially in Florida. It is also very commonly used as a rootstock for nursery production, and is hardy to {{convert|-4|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.
;[[Maluma (avocado)|'Maluma']]: A relatively new cultivar, it was discovered in South Africa in the early 1990s by Mr. A.G. (Dries) Joubert. It is a chance seedling of unknown parentage.
; 'Pinkerton': First grown on the Pinkerton Ranch in [[Saticoy, California]], in the early 1970s, 'Pinkerton' is a seedling of 'Hass' x 'Rincon'. The large fruit has a small seed, and its green skin deepens in color as it ripens. The thick flesh has a smooth, creamy texture, pale green color, good flavor, and high oil content. It shows some cold tolerance, to {{convert|-1|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and bears consistently heavy crops. A hybrid Guatemalan type, it has excellent peeling characteristics.
; 'Reed': Developed from a chance seedling found in 1948 by James S. Reed in California, this cultivar has large, round, green fruit with a smooth texture and dark, thick, glossy skin. Smooth and delicate, the flesh has a slightly nutty flavor. The skin ripens green. A Guatemalan type, it is hardy to {{convert|-1|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Tree size is about {{convert|5|by|4|m|1|abbr=on}}.

=== B cultivars ===
; 'Bacon': Developed by a farmer, James Bacon, in 1954, Bacon has medium-sized fruit with smooth, green skin with yellow-green, light-tasting flesh. When ripe, the skin remains green, but darkens slightly, and fruit yields to gentle pressure. It is cold-hardy down to {{convert|-5|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.
; [[Brogden (avocado)|'Brogden']]: Possibly a cross between Mexican and West Indian types, 'Brogden' originated as a seedling grown in Winter Haven, Florida, on the property of Tom W. Brogden. The variety was recognized for its cold-hardiness to {{convert|-5|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and became commercially propagated as nursery stock for home growing.

;[[Monroe (avocado)|'Monroe']]: A Guatemalan/West Indian cross that originated from a seedling grown in Homestead, Florida, on the property of J.J.L. Phillips, it was patented in 1937 and became a major commercial cultivar due to its cold hardiness and production qualities. The fruit is large, averaging over {{convert|2|lb|kg|abbr=on}} in weight, has an elliptical shape, and green, glossy skin. Hardy to {{convert|-3|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.
; 'Sharwil': Predominantly Guatemalan, with some Mexican race genes, 'Sharwil' was developed in 1951 by Sir Frank Sharpe at [[Redland Bay, Queensland|Redland Bay]], southern [[Queensland]]. The name "Sharwil" is an amalgamation of Sharpe and Wilson (J.C. Wilson being the first propagator). Scions were sent from Australia to Hawaii in 1966. A medium-sized fruit with rough green skin, it closely resembles the 'Fuerte', but is slightly more oval in shape. The fruit has greenish-yellow flesh with a rich, nutty flavor and high oil content (20–24%), and a small seed. The skin is green when ripe. It represents more than 57% of the commercial farming in Hawaii, and represents up to 20% of all avocados grown in [[New South Wales]], Australia. It is a regular and moderate bearer with excellent quality fruit, but is sensitive to frost. Disease and pest resistance are superior to 'Fuerte'.
; 'Zutano': Originated by R.L. Ruitt in Fallbrook in 1926, this Mexican variety is hardy to {{convert|-4|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The large, pear-shaped fruit has a shiny, thin, yellow-green skin that peels moderately easily. The flesh is pale green with fibers and has a light flavor.

=== Other cultivars ===

==== Stoneless avocado ====

A stoneless avocado, marketed as a "cocktail avocado," which does not contain a pit, is available on a limited basis.

In 2016, world production of avocados was 5.6 million [[tonnes]], led by [[Mexico]] alone with 34% (1.89 million tonnes) of the total (table). Other major producers were [[Dominican Republic]], [[Peru]], [[Colombia]], and [[Indonesia]], together producing 30% of the world total (table).&lt;ref name=faostat/&gt;

== Avocado-related international trade issues ==
[[File:Avocado firstInternationalShipment.jpg|thumb|left|First international air shipment of avocados from [[Los Angeles]], California, to [[Toronto]], Ontario, for the [[Canadian National Exhibition]]]]

After the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) went into effect in 1994, Mexico tried exporting avocados to the US. The US government resisted, claiming the trade would introduce [[Tephritidae]] fruit flies that would destroy California's crops. The Mexican government responded by inviting [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] inspectors to Mexico, but the US government declined, claiming fruit fly inspection was not feasible. The Mexican government then proposed to sell avocados only to the northeastern US in the winter (fruit flies cannot withstand extreme cold). The US government balked, but gave in when the Mexican government started erecting barriers to US [[Maize|corn]].

In 2009, Peru joined Chile and Mexico as an exporter of avocados to the US.&lt;ref name="COPLA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08b58ed915d3cfd000c8a/Productivity-and-opennes_Moron.pdf |title = The productivity connection behind openness|accessdate = 2017-02-14|date = 2009-05-05|publisher = Trade and Poverty in Latin America (COPLA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, avocados are grown in California and Florida, where land, labor, and water are expensive. Avocado trees require frequent, deep watering to bear optimally, particularly in spring, summer, and fall. Due to increased Southern California water costs, they are now costly to grow. California produces 90% of the United States' avocados.&lt;ref name="CACFF" /&gt;

As of 2013, Mexico leads international exports, with other significant production in California, New Zealand, Peru, and South Africa.

{{see also|List of avocado dishes}}
[[File:2014 avocado salad tomato salsa toasted baguette.jpg|thumb|upright|Avocado salad, and a tomato and black olive salsa, on a toasted [[baguette]]]]
The fruit of horticultural cultivars has a markedly higher [[fat]] content than most other fruit, mostly [[monounsaturated fat]], and as such serves as an important staple in the diet of consumers who have limited access to other fatty foods (high-fat meats and fish, dairy products). Having a high [[smoke point]], [[avocado oil]] is expensive compared to common [[salad oil|salad]] and [[cooking oil]]s, and mostly used for salads or [[dip (food)|dips]].

A ripe avocado yields to gentle pressure when held in the palm of the hand and squeezed. The flesh is prone to [[enzymatic browning]], quickly turning brown after exposure to air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Fruit &amp; Nuts|year=2008|publisher=CABI|location=Oxforshire, England|isbn=978-0-85199-638-7|page=440|editor=Jules Janick}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent this, [[lime (fruit)|lime]] or [[lemon]] juice can be added to avocados after peeling.

[[File:IndonesianFood JusAlpokat.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian-style]] avocado milkshake with chocolate syrup]]

The fruit is not sweet, but distinctly and subtly flavored, with smooth texture.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; It is used in both savory and sweet dishes, though in many countries not for both. The avocado is popular in [[vegetarian cuisine]] as a substitute for meats in sandwiches and salads because of its high [[fat]] content.

Generally, avocado is served raw, though some cultivars, including the common 'Hass', can be cooked for a short time without becoming bitter. The flesh of some avocados may be rendered inedible by heat. Prolonged cooking induces this chemical reaction in all cultivars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1970.tb00962.x |title=Heat-Induced Off-Flavor in Avocado Flesh |journal=Journal of Food Science |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=478–82 |year=1970 |last1=Bates |first1=Robert P }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Guacomole.jpg|thumb|A [[guacamole]] mix (right) used as a dip for [[tortilla chip]]s (left).]]
It is used as the base for the Mexican dip known as [[guacamole]],&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; as well as a spread on [[corn tortillas]] or toast, served with spices.

In the [[Philippines]], Brazil, [[Indonesia]], [[Vietnam]], and southern India (especially the coastal [[Kerala]], Tamil Nadu and [[Karnataka]] region), avocados are frequently used for milkshakes and occasionally added to [[ice cream]] and other desserts. In Brazil, Vietnam, the Philippines&lt;ref name="zeldes"&gt;{{cite web|last = Zeldes|first = Leah A.|title = Eat this!

[[Chocolate syrup]] is sometimes added. In [[Morocco]], a similar chilled avocado and milk drink is sweetened with [[confectioner's sugar]] and flavored with a touch of [[orange flower water]].

In [[Ethiopia]], avocados are made into juice by mixing them with sugar and milk or water, usually served with [[Vimto]] and a slice of lemon. It is also common to serve layered multiple fruit juices in a glass (locally called ''Spris'') made of avocados, mangoes, bananas, guavas, and papayas. Avocados are also used to make salads.

Avocados in savory dishes, often seen as exotic, are a relative novelty in Portuguese-speaking countries, such as Brazil, where the traditional preparation is mashed with sugar and lime, and eaten as a dessert or snack. This contrasts with Spanish-speaking countries such as Chile, Mexico, or [[Argentina]], where the opposite is true and sweet preparations are rare.

[[File:Sliced avocado.jpg|thumb|Sliced avocado]]

In Australia and New Zealand, it is commonly served in sandwiches, sushi, on toast, or with chicken. In [[Ghana]], it is often eaten alone in sliced bread as a sandwich. In [[Sri Lanka]], well-ripened flesh, thoroughly mashed with sugar and milk, or treacle (a syrup made from the nectar of a particular palm flower) is a popular dessert. In [[Haiti]], it is often consumed with [[cassava]] or regular bread for breakfast.

In Mexico and Central America, avocados are served mixed with white rice, in soups, salads, or on the side of chicken and meat. In Peru, they are consumed with ''[[tequeño]]s'' as mayonnaise, served as a side dish with ''[[Asado|parrillas]]'', used in salads and sandwiches, or as a whole dish when filled with tuna, shrimp, or chicken. In [[Chile]], it is used as a puree-like sauce with chicken, [[hamburger]]s, and [[hot dog]]s; and in slices for [[celery]] or [[lettuce]] salads. The Chilean version of [[Caesar salad]] contains large slices of mature avocado. In [[Kenya]] and Nigeria, the avocado is often eaten as a fruit eaten alone or mixed with other fruits in a fruit salad, or as part of a vegetable salad.

Avocado is a primary ingredient in [[avocado soup]]. Avocado slices are frequently added to hamburgers, ''[[tortas]]'', [[hot dogs]], and ''[[carne asada]]''. Avocado can be combined with eggs (in scrambled eggs, tortillas, or omelettes), and is a key ingredient in [[California roll]]s and other ''[[makizushi]]'' ("maki", or rolled [[sushi]]).

In the United Kingdom, the avocado became available during the 1960s when introduced by [[Sainsbury's]] under the name 'avocado pear'.&lt;ref name=scotsman /&gt;

=== Leaves ===

In addition to the fruit, the leaves of Mexican avocados (''Persea americana'' var. ''drymifolia'') are used in some cuisines as a [[spice]], with a flavor somewhat reminiscent of [[anise]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} They are sold both dried and fresh, toasted before use, and either crumbled or used whole, commonly in bean dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Diana Kennedy|title=Oaxaca Al Gusto: An Infinite Gastronomy|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2010|page=426|isbn=0-292-72266-4|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=vY4j3OIDMeoC&amp;pg=PA426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaves of ''P. americana'', [[Guatemala|Guatemalan]] variety, are [[toxicity|toxic]] to goats, sheep, and horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Livestock - Poisoning Plants of California, Publication 8398|url=http://alfalfa.ucdavis.edu/-files/pdf/LivestockPoisoningPlantsNov2010.pdf|publisher=Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of California|accessdate=26 February 2018|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nutrients and fat composition ===
A typical serving of avocado (100 g) is moderate to rich in several [[B vitamins]] and [[vitamin K]], with good content of [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin E]] and [[potassium]] (right table, USDA nutrient data). Avocados also contain [[phytosterols]] and [[carotenoids]], such as [[lutein]] and [[zeaxanthin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |year=2013|volume=53|issue=7|pages=738–50 |doi=10.1080/10408398.2011.556759|pmid=23638933|title=Hass avocado composition and potential health effects|vauthors=Dreher ML, Davenport AJ |pmc=3664913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avocados have diverse fats.&lt;ref name=ND&gt;{{cite web|url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1843/2|title = Avocados, raw, all commercial varieties, per 100 grams|publisher = NutritionData.com|accessdate = 2013-04-17|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a typical avocado:
* About 75% of an avocado's energy comes from fat, most of which (67% of total fat) is [[monounsaturated fat]] as [[oleic acid]].&lt;ref name=ND/&gt;
* Other predominant fats include [[palmitic acid]] and [[linoleic acid]].&lt;ref name=ND/&gt;
* The [[saturated fat]] content amounts to 14% of the total fat.&lt;ref name=ND/&gt;
* Typical total fat composition is roughly: 1%&amp;nbsp;[[omega-3 fatty acid|ω-3]], 14%&amp;nbsp;[[omega-6 fatty acid|ω-6]], 71%&amp;nbsp;[[omega-9 fatty acid|ω-9]] (65% oleic and 6% palmitoleic), and 14% [[saturated fat]] (palmitic acid).&lt;ref name=ND/&gt;

Although costly to produce, nutrient-rich avocado oil has diverse uses for salads or cooking and in [[cosmetics]] and soap products.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt;

== As a houseplant ==
[[File:20cm avocado leaf.JPG|thumb|Avocado houseplant leaf with ruler to indicate size]]

The avocado tree can be grown domestically and used as a (decorative) [[houseplant]]. The pit germinates in normal soil conditions or partially submerged in a small glass (or container) of water. In the latter method, the pit sprouts in four to six weeks, at which time it is planted in standard houseplant potting soil. The plant normally grows large enough to be prunable; it does not bear fruit unless it has ample sunlight. Home gardeners can [[Grafting|graft]] a branch from a fruit-bearing plant to speed maturity, which typically takes four to six years to bear fruit.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

== Allergies ==
Some people have [[allergic]] reactions to avocado. There are two main forms of allergy: those with a tree-pollen allergy develop local symptoms in the mouth and throat shortly after eating avocado; the second, known as latex-fruit syndrome,&lt;ref name="pmid9188921"&gt;{{cite journal

Avocado leaves, [[Bark (botany)|bark]], skin, or [[Endocarp|pit]] are documented to be harmful to animals; cats, dogs, cattle, goats, rabbits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Appleman, D. |url=http://www.avocadosource.com/CAS_Yearbooks/CAS_29_1944/CAS_1944_PG_037.pdf |title=Preliminary Report on Toxicity of Avocado Leaves |year=1944 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; rats, guinea pigs, birds, fish, and horses&lt;ref name="kgkat.tripod.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cbif.gc.ca/pls/pp/ppack.info?p_psn=238&amp;p_type=all&amp;p_sci=comm&amp;p_x=px|title = Notes on poisoning: avocado|publisher = Canadian Biodiversity Information Facility|accessdate = 2007-12-29|date = 2006-06-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080114023756/http://www.cbif.gc.ca/pls/pp/ppack.info?p_psn=238&amp;p_type=all&amp;p_sci=comm&amp;p_x=px| archivedate= 14 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be severely harmed or even killed when they consume them. The avocado fruit is poisonous to some birds, and the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA) lists it as toxic to horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/poison-control/plants/avocado.html |title=Avocado|work=ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avocado leaves contain a toxic fatty acid derivative, [[persin]], which in sufficient quantity can cause [[colic in horses]] and without veterinary treatment, death.&lt;ref name="pmid8581318"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/nt.2620030504 |pmid=8581318 |title=Isolation and identification of a compound from avocado (Persea americana) leaves which causes necrosis of the acinar epithelium of the lactating mammary gland and the myocardium |journal=Natural Toxins |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=344–9 |year=1995 |last1=Oelrichs |first1=Peter B |last2=Ng |first2=Jack C |last3=Seawright |first3=Alan A |last4=Ward |first4=Annemarie |last5=Schäffeler |first5=Lothar |last6=MacLeod |first6=John K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms include gastrointestinal irritation, vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory distress, congestion, fluid accumulation around the tissues of the heart, and even death.

== Coevolution ==
In 1982, evolutionary biologist [[Daniel H. Janzen]] concluded that the avocado is an example of an '[[evolutionary anachronism]]', a fruit adapted for [[ecology|ecological]] relationship with now-[[extinction|extinct]] large mammals (such as giant [[ground sloth]]s or [[gomphothere]]s). Most large fleshy fruits serve the function of [[seed|seed dispersal]], accomplished by their consumption by large animals. There are some reasons to think that the fruit, with its mildly toxic pit, may have [[coevolved]] with [[Pleistocene megafauna]] to be swallowed whole and excreted in their dung, ready to sprout. No extant native animal is large enough to effectively disperse avocado seeds in this fashion.&lt;ref name="isbn0-465-00551-9"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cited in Barlow |author2=Connie C. |title=The ghosts of evolution: nonsensical fruit, missing partners, and other ecological anachronisms |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-465-00551-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.chapingo.mx/revistas/horticultura/contenido.php?id_articulo=735&amp;id_revistas=1&amp;id_revista_numero=70 |doi=10.5154/r.rchsh.1999.06.043 |year=1999 |journal=Revista Chapingo Serie Horticultura |volume=5 |issue= |pages=77–88 |title=Ecophysiology of the avocado (''Persea americana'' Mill.) tree as a basis for pre-harvest management |last1=Nigel-Wolstenholme |first1=B. |last2=Whiley |first2=A.W. |doi-broken-date=2018-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bananavarieties.jpg|thumb|Fruits of four different [[List of banana cultivars|banana cultivars]]]]
A '''banana''' is an edible [[fruit]] – botanically a [[berry (botany)|berry]]&lt;ref name=purdue1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Armstrong/&gt; – produced by several kinds of large [[herbaceous]] [[flowering plant]]s in the [[genus]] ''[[Musa (genus)|Musa]]''.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; In some countries, [[Cooking banana|bananas used for cooking]] may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from '''dessert bananas'''. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in [[starch]] covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless ([[Parthenocarpy|parthenocarp]]) bananas come from two wild species&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]''. The [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] of most cultivated bananas are ''Musa acuminata'', ''Musa balbisiana'', and ''Musa'' × ''paradisiaca'' for the hybrid ''Musa acuminata'' × ''M.&amp;nbsp;balbisiana'', depending on their [[genome|genomic]] constitution. The old scientific name ''Musa sapientum'' is no longer used.

''Musa'' species are native to tropical [[Indomalaya]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], and are likely to have been first domesticated in [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=apscience/&gt;{{sfn|Nelson|Ploetz|Kepler|2006}} They are grown in 135 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.promusa.org/Banana-producing+countries+portal | title=Where bananas are grown | publisher=ProMusa | date=2013 | accessdate=October 24, 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111611/http://www.promusa.org/Banana-producing+countries+portal | archivedate=October 25, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make [[fiber]], [[banana wine]], and [[banana beer]] and as [[ornamental plant]]s. The world's largest producers of bananas in 2016 were India and China, which together accounted for 28% of total production.

Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between "bananas" and "plantains". Especially in the Americas and Europe, "banana" usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the [[#Cavendish|Cavendish group]], which are the main exports from banana-growing countries. By contrast, [[List of banana cultivars|''Musa'' cultivars]] with firmer, starchier fruit are called "plantains". In other regions, such as [[Southeast Asia]], many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the binary distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.

The term "banana" is also used as the common name for the plants that produce the fruit.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; This can extend to other members of the genus ''Musa'', such as the [[Musa coccinea|scarlet banana]] (''Musa coccinea''), the [[Musa velutina|pink banana]] (''Musa velutina''), and the [[Fe'i banana]]s. It can also refer to members of the genus ''[[Ensete]]'', such as the [[Ensete glaucum|snow banana]] (''Ensete glaucum'') and the economically important [[Ensete ventricosum|false banana]] (''Ensete ventricosum''). Both genera are in the banana family, [[Musaceae]].

[[File:Baby Banana Plant.jpg|thumb|upright|Young banana plant]]
The banana plant is the largest [[herbaceous]] flowering plant.&lt;ref name=PicqINIB00/&gt; All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a "[[corm]]".{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=5–9}} Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy, and are often mistaken for [[tree]]s, but what appears to be a trunk is actually a "false stem" or [[pseudostem]]. Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60&amp;nbsp;cm deep, has good drainage and is not compacted.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|p=212}} The leaves of banana plants are composed of a "stalk" ([[petiole (botany)|petiole]]) and a blade ([[Leaf#General characteristics of leaves|lamina]]). The base of the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make up the pseudostem, which is all that supports the plant. The edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced, making it tubular. As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are forced apart.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=13–17}} Cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety and growing conditions. Most are around {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} tall, with a range from 'Dwarf Cavendish' plants at around {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} to 'Gros Michel' at {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} or more.{{sfn|Nelson|Ploetz|Kepler|2006|p=26}}{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} Leaves are spirally arranged and may grow {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} long and {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name="purdue1"/&gt; They are easily torn by the wind, resulting in the familiar frond look.&lt;ref name=Greenearth/&gt;

When a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or [[inflorescence]]. A stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem, carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it emerges at the top.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=9–13}} Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence, also known as the "banana heart". (More are sometimes produced; an exceptional plant in the [[Philippines]] produced five.&lt;ref name=ABS_CBN/&gt;) After fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots will normally have developed from the base, so that the plant as a whole is [[perennial]]. In the plantation system of cultivation, only one of the offshoots will be allowed to develop in order to maintain spacing.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=244–247}} The inflorescence contains many [[bract]]s (sometimes incorrectly referred to as petals) between rows of flowers. The female flowers (which can develop into fruit) appear in rows further up the stem (closer to the leaves) from the rows of male flowers. The ovary is [[ovary (plants)|inferior]], meaning that the tiny petals and other flower parts appear at the tip of the ovary.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008}}

The banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of tiers (called "hands"), with up to 20 fruit to a tier. The hanging cluster is known as a bunch, comprising 3–20 [[wikt:tier#noun 2|tiers]], or commercially as a "banana stem", and can weigh {{convert|30|–|50|kg|lb}}. Individual banana fruits (commonly known as a banana or "finger") average {{convert|125|g|lb}}, of which approximately 75% is [[water]] and 25% dry matter (nutrient table, lower right).

The fruit has been described as a "leathery berry".&lt;ref name=Smit77/&gt; There is a protective outer layer (a [[Peel (fruit)|peel]] or skin) with numerous long, thin strings (the [[phloem]] [[Vascular bundle|bundles]]), which run lengthwise between the skin and the [[Eating|edible]] inner portion. The inner part of the common yellow dessert variety can be split lengthwise into three sections that correspond to the inner portions of the three [[carpel]]s by manually deforming the unopened fruit.&lt;ref name=Wark04/&gt; In cultivated varieties, the seeds are diminished nearly to non-existence; their remnants are tiny black specks in the interior of the fruit.&lt;ref name=Simm62/&gt;

Bananas are naturally slightly [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]],&lt;ref name=Brod78/&gt; more so than most other fruits, because of their potassium content and the small amounts of the isotope [[potassium-40]] found in naturally occurring potassium.&lt;ref name=CassWu07/&gt; The [[banana equivalent dose]] of radiation is sometimes used in nuclear communication to compare radiation levels and exposures.&lt;ref name=ETR/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word banana is thought to be of West African origin, possibly from the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] word ''[[wikt:banaana|banaana]]'', and passed into English via Spanish or Portuguese.&lt;ref name=OEtymD/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Nedravazhakola.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Musa'' 'Nendran' [[cultivar]] grown widely in the [[India]]n state of [[Kerala]] is a member of the [[List of banana cultivars#AAB Group|AAB cultivar group]]]]
[[File:Banana trees, Mahamaya Lake (01).jpg|thumb|Banana plants, [[Mahamaya Lake]], Chittagong, Bangladesh]]
The genus ''[[Musa (genus)|Musa]]'' was created by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753.&lt;ref name=WCSP_Musa/&gt; The name may be derived from [[Antonius Musa]], physician to the Emperor [[Augustus]], or Linnaeus may have adapted the [[Arabic]] word for banana, ''[[wikt:موز|mauz]]''.&lt;ref name=HyamPank95/&gt; The old biological name ''[[Musa sapientum]]'' = "Muse of the wise" arose because of homophony in Latin with the classical [[Muses]].

''Musa'' is in the family [[Musaceae]]. The [[APG III system]] assigns Musaceae to the order [[Zingiberales]], part of the [[commelinid]] clade of the [[monocotyledon]]ous flowering plants. Some 70 species of ''Musa'' were recognized by the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] {{asof|2013|January|lc=yes}};&lt;ref name=WCSP_Musa/&gt; several produce edible fruit, while others are cultivated as ornamentals.&lt;ref name=Bail16/&gt;

The classification of cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists. Linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: ''Musa sapientum'' for dessert bananas and ''Musa paradisiaca'' for [[Plantain (true)|plantains]]. More species names were added, but this approach proved to be inadequate for the number of [[cultivar]]s in the primary center of diversity of the genus, [[Southeast Asia]]. Many of these cultivars were given names that were later discovered to be [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}}

In a series of papers published from 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus's ''Musa sapientum'' and ''Musa paradisiaca'' were cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]'', both first described by [[Luigi Aloysius Colla]].&lt;ref name=DRC/&gt; Cheesman recommended the abolition of Linnaeus's species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars – those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa balbisiana'', those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa acuminata'', and those with characteristics of both.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}} Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955. This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties. Despite this, the original names are still recognized by some authorities today, leading to confusion.&lt;ref name=DRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Porc02/&gt;

The accepted [[Botanical name|scientific names]] for most groups of cultivated bananas are '''''Musa acuminata''''' &lt;small&gt;Colla&lt;/small&gt; and '''''Musa balbisiana''''' &lt;small&gt;Colla&lt;/small&gt; for the ancestral species, and '''''Musa'' × ''paradisiaca''''' &lt;small&gt;L.&lt;/small&gt; for the hybrid ''M. acuminata'' × ''M. balbisiana''.&lt;ref name=WCSP_Mp/&gt;

[[Synonym (taxonomy)|Synonyms]] of ''M.'' × ''paradisica'' include
* a large number of subspecific and varietial names of ''M.'' × ''paradisiaca'', including ''M. p.'' subsp. ''sapientum'' &lt;small&gt;(L.) Kuntze&lt;/small&gt;
* ''Musa'' × ''dacca'' &lt;small&gt;Horan.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''Musa'' × ''sapidisiaca'' &lt;small&gt;K.C.Jacob, nom. superfl.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''Musa'' × ''sapientum'' &lt;small&gt;L.&lt;/small&gt;, and a large number of its varietal names, including ''M.'' × ''sapientum'' var. ''paradisiaca'' &lt;small&gt;(L.) Baker, nom. illeg.&lt;/small&gt;

Generally, modern classifications of banana cultivars follow Simmonds and Shepherd's system. Cultivars are placed in groups based on the number of chromosomes they have and which species they are derived from. Thus the [[Latundan banana]] is placed in the AAB Group, showing that it is a triploid derived from both ''M. acuminata'' (A) and ''M. balbisiana'' (B). For a list of the cultivars classified under this system, ''see'' "[[List of banana cultivars]]".

In 2012, a team of scientists announced they had achieved a draft sequence of the genome of ''[[Musa acuminata]]''.&lt;ref name=dHon12/&gt;

==Bananas and plantains==
In regions such as North America and Europe, ''Musa'' fruits offered for sale can be divided into "bananas" and "[[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]]", based on their intended use as food. Thus the banana producer and distributor [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]] produces publicity material for the American market which says that "a plantain is not a banana". The stated differences are that plantains are more [[starch]]y and less sweet; they are eaten cooked rather than raw; they have thicker skin, which may be green, yellow or black; and they can be used at any stage of ripeness.&lt;ref name=Chiquita/&gt; Linnaeus made the same distinction between plantains and bananas when first naming two "species" of ''Musa''.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Members of the "[[Plantain (true)|plantain subgroup]]" of banana cultivars, most important as food in West Africa and Latin America, correspond to the Chiquita description, having long pointed fruit. They are described by Ploetz et al. as "true" plantains, distinct from other cooking bananas.{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|pp=18–19}} The cooking bananas of East Africa belong to a different group, the [[East African Highland banana]]s,{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} so would not qualify as "true" plantains on this definition.
[[File:Bananas white background DS.jpg|thumb|[[Cavendish bananas]] are the most common dessert bananas sold]]
An alternative approach divides bananas into dessert bananas and cooking bananas, with plantains being one of the subgroups of cooking bananas.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008|p=1}} [[Polyploid|Triploid]] cultivars derived solely from ''M.&amp;nbsp;acuminata'' are examples of "dessert bananas", whereas triploid cultivars derived from the hybrid between ''M.&amp;nbsp;acuminata'' and ''M.&amp;nbsp;balbinosa'' (in particular the plantain subgroup of the [[List of banana cultivars#AAB Group|AAB Group]]) are "plantains".&lt;ref name=StovSimm87p183/&gt;&lt;ref name=QiMoorOrch00/&gt; Small farmers in [[Colombia]] grow a much wider range of cultivars than large commercial plantations. A study of these cultivars showed that they could be placed into at least three groups based on their characteristics: dessert bananas, non-plantain cooking bananas, and plantains, although there were overlaps between dessert and cooking bananas.&lt;ref name=GibeDufoGiraSanc09/&gt;

In Southeast Asia – the center of diversity for bananas, both wild and cultivated – the distinction between "bananas" and "plantains" does not work, according to Valmayor et al. Many bananas are used both raw and cooked. There are starchy cooking bananas which are smaller than those eaten raw. The range of colors, sizes and shapes is far wider than in those grown or sold in Africa, Europe or the Americas.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Southeast Asian languages do not make the distinction between "bananas" and "plantains" that is made in English (and Spanish). Thus both [[#Cavendish|Cavendish cultivars]], the classic yellow dessert bananas, and [[Saba banana|Saba cultivars]], used mainly for cooking, are called ''pisang'' in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], ''kluai'' in [[Thailand]] and ''chuoi'' in [[Vietnam]].{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|pp=8–12}} [[Fe'i banana]]s, grown and eaten in the islands of the Pacific, are derived from entirely different wild species than traditional bananas and plantains. Most Fe'i bananas are cooked, but [[Karat banana]]s, which are short and squat with bright red skins, very different from the usual yellow dessert bananas, are eaten raw.&lt;ref name=Engl03/&gt;

In summary, in commerce in Europe and the Americas (although not in small-scale cultivation), it is possible to distinguish between "bananas", which are eaten raw, and "plantains", which are cooked. In other regions of the world, particularly India, Southeast Asia and the islands of the Pacific, there are many more kinds of banana and the two-fold distinction is not useful and not made in local languages. Plantains are one of many kinds of cooking bananas, which are not always distinct from dessert bananas.

Farmers in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Papua New Guinea]] first [[domestication|domesticated]] bananas. Recent [[archaeology|archaeological]] and palaeoenvironmental evidence at [[Kuk Swamp]] in the [[Western Highlands Province]] of Papua New Guinea suggests that banana cultivation there goes back to at least 5000 [[Common Era|BCE]], and possibly to 8000 BCE.&lt;ref name=apscience/&gt;&lt;ref name=Denh03/&gt; It is likely that other species were later and independently domesticated elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is the region of [[Center of diversity|primary diversity]] of the banana.

[[Phytolith]] discoveries in [[Cameroon]] dating to the first millennium BCE&lt;ref name=Mbid00/&gt; triggered an as yet unresolved debate about the date of first cultivation in Africa. There is linguistic evidence that bananas were known in [[Madagascar]] around that time.&lt;ref name=Zell05/&gt; The earliest prior evidence indicates that cultivation dates to no earlier than late 6th century CE.&lt;ref name=Lejj05/&gt; It is likely, however, that bananas were brought at least to Madagascar if not to the East African coast during the phase of [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] colonization of the island from South East Asia c. 400 CE.&lt;ref name=Rand09/&gt;

The banana may also have been present in isolated locations elsewhere in the [[Middle East]] on the eve of [[Islam]]. The [[spread of Islam]] was followed by far-reaching diffusion. There are numerous references to it in Islamic texts (such as poems and [[hadith]]s) beginning in the 9th century. By the 10th century the banana appears in texts from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]]. From there it diffused into North Africa and [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Iberia]]. During the medieval ages, bananas from [[Granada]] were considered among the best in the Arab world.&lt;ref name=Wats83/&gt; In 650, Islamic conquerors brought the banana to Palestine. Today, banana consumption increases significantly in Islamic countries during [[Ramadan]], the month of daylight fasting.&lt;ref name="thefinancialexpress-bd"/&gt;

Bananas were certainly grown in the Christian [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] by the late medieval period. Writing in 1458, the Italian traveller and writer {{ILL|Gabriele Capodilista|it}} wrote favourably of the extensive farm produce of the estates at Episkopi, near modern-day [[Limassol]], including the region's banana plantations.&lt;ref name=Jenn92/&gt;

Bananas were introduced to the [[Americas]] by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sailors who brought the fruits from [[West Africa]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Botgard/&gt;

Many [[Musa (genus)#Species|wild banana species]] as well as cultivars exist in extraordinary diversity in [[India]], [[China]], and [[Southeast Asia]].

===Plantation cultivation in the Caribbean, Central and South America===
{{Main|History of modern banana plantations in the Americas}}
[[File:Inside a wild-type banana.jpg|thumb|Fruits of [[Wild type|wild-type]] bananas have numerous large, hard seeds.|alt=Photo of two cross-sectional halves of seed-filled fruit.]]

In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portuguese colonists started banana plantations in the Atlantic Islands, [[Brazil]], and western Africa.&lt;ref name=Phora/&gt; North Americans began consuming bananas on a small scale at very high prices shortly after the Civil War, though it was only in the 1880s that the food became more widespread.&lt;ref name=Koep08/&gt; As late as the [[Victorian Era]], bananas were not widely known in Europe, although they were available.&lt;ref name=Phora/&gt; [[Jules Verne]] introduces bananas to his readers with detailed descriptions in ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' (1872).

The earliest modern plantations originated in [[Jamaica]] and the related [[Western Caribbean Zone]], including most of [[Central America]]. It involved the combination of modern transportation networks of steamships and railroads with the development of refrigeration that allowed  more time between harvesting and ripening. North American shippers like [[Lorenzo Dow Baker]] and [[Andrew Preston]], the founders of the [[Boston Fruit Company]] started this process in the 1870s, but railroad builders like [[Minor C. Keith]] also participated, eventually culminating in the multi-national giant corporations like today's [[Chiquita Brands International]] and [[Dole Food Company|Dole]].&lt;ref name=Koep08/&gt; These companies were [[monopoly|monopolistic]], [[vertically integrated]] (meaning they controlled growing, processing, shipping and marketing) and usually used political manipulation to build [[enclave economy|enclave economies]] (economies that were internally self-sufficient, virtually tax exempt, and export-oriented that contribute very little to the host economy). Their political maneuvers, which gave rise to the term [[Banana republic]] for states like Honduras and Guatemala, included working with local elites and their rivalries to influence politics or playing the international interests of the United States, especially during the [[Cold War]], to keep the political climate favorable to their interests.&lt;ref name=NZH/&gt;

===Peasant cultivation for export in the Caribbean===
{{Main|History of peasant banana production in the Americas}}

The vast majority of the world's bananas today are cultivated for family consumption or for sale on local markets. India is the world leader in this sort of production, but many other Asian and African countries where climate and soil conditions allow cultivation also host large populations of banana growers who sell at least some of their crop.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008|pp=7–8}}

Peasant sector banana growers produce for the world market in the Caribbean, however. The [[Windward Islands]] are notable for the growing, largely of Cavendish bananas, for an international market, generally in Europe but also in North America. In the Caribbean, and especially in Dominica where this sort of cultivation is widespread, holdings are in the 1–2 acre range. In many cases the farmer earns additional money from other crops, from engaging in labor outside the farm, and from a share of the earnings of relatives living overseas.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Banana crops are vulnerable to destruction by high winds, such as tropical storms or [[cyclone]]s.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=206–207}}

==Modern cultivation==
All widely cultivated bananas today descend from the two wild bananas ''Musa acuminata'' and ''Musa balbisiana''. While the original wild bananas contained large seeds, [[diploid]] or [[polyploid]] cultivars (some being [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]) with tiny seeds are preferred for human raw fruit consumption.&lt;ref name=Cast09/&gt; These are propagated [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] from offshoots. The plant is allowed to produce two shoots at a time; a larger one for immediate fruiting and a smaller "sucker" or "follower" to produce fruit in 6–8 months.

As a non-seasonal crop, bananas are available fresh year-round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How bananas are grown|url=http://www.bananalink.org.uk/how-bananas-are-grown|website=Banana Link|accessdate=September 2, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906115526/http://www.bananalink.org.uk/how-bananas-are-grown|archivedate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cavendish===
{{main|Cavendish bananas}}
[[File:Bananas.jpg|thumb|alt=Grocery store photo of several bunches of bananas|[[Cavendish bananas]] are the main commercial banana cultivars sold in the world market.]]

In global commerce in 2009, by far the most important cultivars belonged to the triploid [[List of banana cultivars#AAA Group|AAA]] [[cultivar group|group]] of ''Musa acuminata'', commonly referred to as Cavendish group bananas. They accounted for the majority of banana exports,&lt;ref name=Cast09/&gt; despite only coming into existence in 1836.&lt;ref name=Homecooking/&gt; The cultivars [[Dwarf Cavendish]] and [[Grand Nain]] (Chiquita Banana) gained popularity in the 1950s after the previous mass-produced cultivar, [[Gros Michel banana|Gros Michel]] (also an AAA group cultivar), became commercially unviable due to [[Panama disease]], caused by the fungus ''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]'' which attacks the roots of the banana plant.&lt;ref name=Cast09/&gt; Cavendish cultivars are resistant to the Panama Disease, but in 2013 there were fears that the [[Black Sigatoka]] fungus would in turn make Cavendish bananas unviable.&lt;ref name=Holmes/&gt;

Even though it is no longer viable for large scale cultivation, Gros Michel is not extinct and is still grown in areas where Panama disease is not found.&lt;ref name=straightdope/&gt; Likewise, Dwarf Cavendish and Grand Nain are in no danger of extinction, but they may leave supermarket shelves if disease makes it impossible to supply the global market. It is unclear if any existing cultivar can replace Cavendish bananas, so various [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] and [[genetic engineering]] programs are attempting to create a disease-resistant, mass-market banana.&lt;ref name=Cast09/&gt;  One such strain that has emerged is the Taiwanese Cavendish, also known as the Formosana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gittleson|first1=Kim|title=Battling to save the world's bananas|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42777803|accessdate=April 18, 2018|agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ripening===
Export bananas are picked green, and ripen in special rooms upon arrival in the destination country. These rooms are air-tight and filled with [[Ethylene|ethylene gas]] to induce ripening. The vivid yellow color consumers normally associate with supermarket bananas is, in fact, caused by the artificial ripening process.&lt;ref name=Ding07/&gt; Flavor and texture are also affected by ripening temperature. Bananas are refrigerated to between {{convert|13.5|and|15|C|F}} during transport. At lower temperatures, ripening permanently stalls, and the bananas turn gray as cell walls break down. The skin of ripe bananas quickly blackens in the {{convert|4|C}} environment of a domestic [[refrigerator]], although the fruit inside remains unaffected.
[[File:Banana-fluorescence-081108.jpg|thumb|left|Ripened bananas (left, under [[sunlight]]) fluoresce in blue when exposed to [[UV light]].|alt=Two adjacent photos of bananas. The left is in sunlight; the right is under ultraviolet light.]]

Bananas can be ordered by the retailer "ungassed" (''i.e.'' not treated with ethylene), and may show up at the supermarket fully green. {{lang|es|[[Guineos verdes]]}} (green bananas) that have not been gassed will never fully ripen before becoming rotten. Instead of fresh eating, these bananas can be used for cooking, as seen in Jamaican cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/4-ways-use-green-bananas-wont-ripen|title=4 ways to use green bananas that won't ripen|last=Kirschner|first=Chanie|date=January 21, 2016|website=[[Mother Nature Network]]|access-date=April 30, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428035449/http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/4-ways-use-green-bananas-wont-ripen|archivedate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study reported that ripe bananas [[fluoresce]] when exposed to [[ultraviolet]] light. This property is attributed to the degradation of [[chlorophyll]] leading to the accumulation of a fluorescent product in the skin of the fruit. The chlorophyll [[breakdown product]] is stabilized by a [[propionate]] [[ester]] group. Banana-plant leaves also fluoresce in the same way. Green bananas do not fluoresce. The study suggested that this allows animals which can see light in the ultraviolet spectrum ([[tetrachromat]]s and [[pentachromat]]s) to more easily detect ripened bananas.&lt;ref name=Mose08/&gt;
{{clear}}

===Storage and transport===
Bananas must be transported over long distances from the tropics to world markets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=biUhdI19b18C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Bananas+transported+over+long+distances+from+the+tropics+to+world+markets.#v=onepage&amp;q=Bananas%20transported%20over%20long%20distances%20from%20the%20tropics%20to%20world%20markets.|title=The World Banana Economy, 1985-2002|last=FAO)|first=Pedro Arias (Asesor da|date=2003|publisher=Food &amp; Agriculture Org.|isbn=9789251050576|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain maximum shelf life, harvest comes before the fruit is mature. The fruit requires careful handling, rapid transport to ports, cooling, and refrigerated shipping. The goal is to prevent the bananas from producing their natural ripening agent, ethylene. This technology allows storage and transport for 3–4 weeks at {{convert|13|C}}. On arrival, bananas are held at about {{convert|17|C}} and treated with a low concentration of ethylene. After a few days, the fruit begins to ripen and is distributed for final sale. Ripe bananas can be held for a few days at home. If bananas are too green, they can be put in a brown paper bag with an apple or tomato overnight to speed up the ripening process.&lt;ref name=ChiquitaRipen/&gt;

Carbon dioxide (which bananas produce) and ethylene absorbents extend fruit life even at high temperatures. This effect can be exploited by packing banana in a [[polyethylene]] bag and including an ethylene absorbent, e.g., [[potassium permanganate]], on an inert carrier. The bag is then sealed with a band or string. This treatment has been shown to more than double lifespans up to 3–4 weeks without the need for refrigeration.&lt;ref name=Scot70/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scot71/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scot74/&gt;

In 2016, world production of bananas and plantains was 148 million tonnes, led by [[Indian banana trade|India]] and [[China]] with a combined total (only for bananas) of 28% of global production (table). Other major producers were the [[Philippines]], [[Ecuador]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Brazil]], together accounting for 20% of the world total of bananas and plantains (table).

===Developing countries===

Bananas and plantains constitute a major staple [[agriculture|food crop]] for millions of people in [[developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In most tropical countries, green (unripe) bananas used for [[cooking]] represent the main cultivars. Most producers are small-scale [[farmer]]s either for home consumption or local markets. Because bananas and plantains produce fruit year-round, they provide a valuable food source during the ''hunger season'' (when the food from one annual/semi-annual harvest has been consumed, and the next is still to come). Bananas and plantains are important for global [[food security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22801500|year=2012|author1=d'Hont|first1=A|title=The banana (Musa acuminata) genome and the evolution of monocotyledonous plants|journal=Nature|volume=488|issue=7410|pages=213–7|last2=Denoeud|first2=F|last3=Aury|first3=J.

==Pests, diseases, and natural disasters==
{{Main|List of banana and plantain diseases}}
[[File:BananasBlueBagStLucia.jpg|thumb|upright|Banana bunches are sometimes encased in plastic bags for protection. The bags may be coated with [[pesticide]]s.|alt=Photo of bananas in blue plastic bag]]

While in no danger of outright extinction, the most common edible banana cultivar Cavendish (extremely popular in Europe and the Americas) could become unviable for large-scale cultivation in the next 10–20 years. Its predecessor '[[Gros Michel]]', discovered in the 1820s, suffered this fate. Like almost all bananas, Cavendish lacks genetic diversity, which makes it vulnerable to diseases, threatening both commercial cultivation and small-scale subsistence farming.&lt;ref name=NS060613/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mont03/&gt; Some commentators remarked that those variants which could replace what much of the world considers a "typical banana" are so different that most people would not consider them the same fruit, and blame the decline of the banana on [[mendelian inheritance|monogenetic]] cultivation driven by short-term commercial motives.&lt;ref name=NZH/&gt;

===Panama disease===
[[Panama disease]] is caused by a [[fusarium]] soil [[fungus]] (Race 1), which enters the plants through the roots and travels with water into the trunk and leaves, producing [[gel]]s and gums that cut off the flow of water and nutrients, causing the plant to [[wilting|wilt]], and exposing the rest of the plant to lethal amounts of sunlight. Prior to 1960, almost all commercial banana production centered on "Gros Michel", which was highly susceptible.&lt;ref name=Bark08/&gt; Cavendish was chosen as the replacement for Gros Michel because, among resistant cultivars, it produces the highest quality [[fruit]]. However, more care is required for shipping the Cavendish,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} and its quality compared to Gros Michel is debated.&lt;ref name="Lessard"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Complete Book of Bananas |last=Lessard |first=William |year=1992 |isbn=978-0963316103 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to current sources, a deadly form of Panama disease is infecting Cavendish. All plants are genetically identical, which prevents evolution of disease resistance. Researchers are examining hundreds of wild varieties for resistance.&lt;ref name=Bark08/&gt;

====Tropical race 4====
[[Tropical Race 4|Tropical race 4]] (TR4), a reinvigorated strain of Panama disease, was first discovered in 1993. This virulent form of fusarium wilt has wiped out Cavendish in several southeast Asian countries and has recently spread to Australia, India and Mozambique.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}{{Clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} It has yet to reach the Americas; however, the soil-based fungi can easily be carried on boots, clothing, or tools. This is how TR4 travels and will be its most likely route into Latin America. Cavendish is highly susceptible to TR4, and over time Cavendish will almost certainly be eliminated from commercial production by this disease.&lt;ref name=IBS/&gt; The only known defense to TR4 is genetic resistance. This is conferred either by RGA2, a gene isolated from a TR4-resistant diploid banana, or by the nematode-derived Ced9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dale|first1=James|last2=James|first2=Anthony|last3=Paul|first3=Jean-Yves|last4=Khanna|first4=Harjeet|last5=Smith|first5=Mark|last6=Peraza-Echeverria|first6=Santy|last7=Garcia-Bastidas|first7=Fernando|last8=Kema|first8=Gert|last9=Waterhouse|first9=Peter|last10=Mengersen|first10=Kerrie|last11=Harding|first11=Robert|title=Transgenic Cavendish bananas with resistance to Fusarium wilt tropical race 4|journal=Nature Communications|date=November 14, 2017|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1496|doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01670-6|pmid=29133817|pmc=5684404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black sigatoka===
[[Black sigatoka]] is a fungal leaf spot disease first observed in [[Fiji]] in 1963 or 1964. Black Sigatoka (also known as black leaf streak) has spread to banana plantations throughout the tropics from infected banana leaves that were used as packing material. It affects all main cultivars of bananas and plantains (including the Cavendish cultivars&lt;ref name =Holmes/&gt;), impeding [[photosynthesis]] by blackening parts of the leaves, eventually killing the entire leaf. Starved for energy, fruit production falls by 50% or more, and the bananas that do grow [[ripening|ripen]] prematurely, making them unsuitable for export. The fungus has shown ever-increasing resistance to treatment, with the current expense for treating {{convert|1|ha}} exceeding [[United States dollar|$]]1,000 per year. In addition to the expense, there is the question of how long intensive spraying can be environmentally justified.

===Banana bunchy top virus===
[[Banana bunchy top virus]] (BBTV) is a plant virus of the genus ''Babuvirus'', family ''Nanonviridae'' affecting ''Musa spp.'' (including banana, abaca, plantain and ornamental bananas) and ''Ensete spp.'' in the family ''Musaceae''.&lt;ref&gt;National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) &amp; IUCN/SSC Invasive Species Specialist Group. "Banana Bunchy Top Virus." Global Invasive Species Database. N.p., 6 July 2005. &lt;http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=141&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Banana Bunchy Top Disease (BBTD) symptoms include dark green streaks of variable length in leaf veins, midribs and petioles. Leaves become short and stunted as the disease progresses, becoming 'bunched' at the apex of the plant. Infected plants may produce no fruit or the bunch may not emerge from the pseudostem.

Bioversity International, Rome&lt;/ref&gt; The virus is transmitted by the banana aphid ''[[Pentalonia nigronervosa]]'' and is widespread in SE Asia, Asia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Oceania and parts of Africa. There is no cure for BBTD, but it can be effectively controlled by the eradication of diseased plants and the use of virus-free planting material.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Thomas, M-L. Iskra-Caruana and D.R.

The commercially important Cavendish subgroup is severely affected.&lt;ref name ="techguide"/&gt;

===Banana bacterial wilt===

[[Banana Xanthomonas wilt|Banana bacterial wilt]] (BBW) is a bacterial disease caused by ''[[Xanthomonas campestris]]'' pv. ''musacearum''.&lt;ref name=Tush04/&gt; After being originally identified on a close relative of bananas, ''[[Ensete ventricosum]]'', in [[Ethiopia]] in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=Brad68/&gt; BBW occurred in Uganda in 2001 affecting all banana cultivars. Since then BBW has been diagnosed in Central and East Africa including the banana growing regions of [[Rwanda]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Burundi]], and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name=Mwan07/&gt;

Given the narrow range of [[genetic diversity]] present in bananas and the many threats via [[Biotic component|biotic]] (pests and diseases) and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] (such as [[drought]]) stress, [[Conservation biology|conservation]] of the full spectrum of banana [[plant genetic resources|genetic resources]] is ongoing.&lt;ref name="genebank"&gt;{{cite web |title=Banana |url=https://www.genebanks.org/resources/crops/banana/ |publisher=Genebank Platform |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banana [[germplasm]] is conserved in many national and regional [[gene banks]], and at the world's largest banana collection, the International ''Musa'' Germplasm Transit Centre (ITC), managed by [[Bioversity International]] and hosted at [[KU Leuven]] in Belgium.&lt;ref name="musagermplasm"&gt;{{cite web |title=International Musa Germplasm Transit Centre |url=https://www.bioversityinternational.org/banana-genebank/ |publisher=BioDiversity International |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Musa'' cultivars are usually seedless, and options for their long-term conservation are constrained by the vegetative nature of the plant's reproductive system. Consequently, they are conserved by three main methods: ''[[in vivo]]'' (planted in field collections), ''[[in vitro]]'' (as plantlets in test tubes within a controlled environment), and by [[cryopreservation]] ([[meristem]]s conserved in [[liquid nitrogen]] at -196&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=genebank/&gt; Genes from wild banana species are conserved as [[DNA]] and as cryopreserved [[pollen]] &lt;ref name=genebank/&gt; and banana seeds from wild species are also conserved, although less commonly, as they are difficult to regenerate. In addition, bananas and their [[crop wild relatives]] are conserved ''[[in situ]]'' (in wild natural habitats where they evolved and continue to do so). Diversity is also conserved in farmers' fields where continuous cultivation, adaptation and improvement of cultivars is often carried out by small-scale farmers growing traditional local cultivars (including home gardens).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musalit.org/seeMore.php?id=1756/MusaNet 2016.

Raw bananas (not including the peel) are 75% water, 23% [[carbohydrates]], 1% [[protein]], and contain negligible [[fat]]. A 100-gram serving supplies 89 [[Calories]], 31% of the US recommended [[Daily Value]] of [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], and moderate amounts of [[vitamin C]], [[manganese]] and [[dietary fiber]] (see table).

===Food and cooking===
{{See also|Cooking plantain|List of banana dishes}}

====Fruit====
Bananas are a staple [[starch]] for many tropical populations. Depending upon cultivar and ripeness, the flesh can vary in taste from starchy to sweet, and texture from firm to mushy. Both the skin and inner part can be eaten raw or cooked. The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is [[isoamyl acetate]] (also known as ''banana oil''), which, along with several other compounds such as [[butyl acetate]] and [[isobutyl acetate]], is a significant contributor to banana flavor.&lt;ref name=Fahl00/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mui02/&gt;&lt;ref name=Salm96/&gt;

During the ripening process, bananas produce the gas [[ethylene]], which acts as a [[plant hormone]] and indirectly affects the flavor. Among other things, ethylene stimulates the formation of [[amylase]], an [[enzyme]] that breaks down starch into sugar, influencing the taste of bananas. The greener, less ripe bananas contain higher levels of starch and, consequently, have a "starchier" taste. On the other hand, yellow bananas taste sweeter due to higher sugar concentrations. Furthermore, ethylene signals the production of [[pectinase]], an enzyme which breaks down the [[pectin]] between the cells of the banana, causing the banana to soften as it ripens.&lt;ref name=plantphys/&gt;&lt;ref name=newton/&gt;

Bananas are eaten deep fried, baked in their skin in a split [[bamboo]], or steamed in [[glutinous rice]] wrapped in a banana leaf. Bananas can be made into [[fruit preserves|jam]]. Banana [[pancake]]s are popular amongst [[Backpacking (travel)|backpackers]] and other travelers in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. This has elicited the expression ''[[Banana Pancake Trail]]'' for those places in [[Asia]] that cater to this group of travelers. [[Banana chips]] are a snack produced from sliced dehydrated or fried banana or plantain, which have a dark brown color and an intense banana taste. Dried bananas are also ground to make [[banana flour]]. Extracting juice is difficult, because when a banana is compressed, it simply turns to pulp. Bananas feature prominently in [[Philippine cuisine]], being part of traditional dishes and desserts like ''[[Maruya (Filipino cuisine)|maruya]]'', ''[[Turón (food)|turón]]'', and ''[[halo-halo]]'' or ''saba con yelo''. Most of these dishes use the [[Saba Banana|Saba]] or Cardaba banana cultivar. Bananas are also commonly used in cuisine in the South-Indian state of [[Kerala]], where they are steamed (''puzhungiyathu''), made into curries,&lt;ref name=pazhampachadi/&gt; fried into chips, (''upperi'')&lt;ref name=Hindu130413/&gt; or fried in batter (''pazhampori'').&lt;ref name=Hindu110228/&gt; [[Pisang goreng]], bananas fried with batter similar to the Filipino ''maruya'' or Kerala ''pazhampori'', is a popular dessert in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. A similar dish is known in the United Kingdom and United States as banana [[fritter]]s.

Plantains are used in various stews and curries or cooked, baked or mashed in much the same way as [[potatoes]], such as the [[pazham pachadi]] dish prepared in [[Kerala]].&lt;ref name=pazhampachadi/&gt;

====Leaves====
{{main|Banana leaf}}
Banana leaves are large, flexible, and waterproof. They are often used as ecologically friendly disposable food containers or as "plates" in [[South Asia]] and several [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. In [[Indonesian cuisine]], banana leaf is employed in cooking methods like [[pepes]] and [[botok]]; banana leaf packages containing food ingredients and spices are cooked in steam or in boiled water, or are grilled on charcoal. When used so for steaming or grilling, the banana leaves protect the food ingredients from burning and add a subtle sweet flavor.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; In [[South India]], it is customary to serve traditional food on a banana leaf. In Tamil Nadu (India), dried banana leaves are used as to pack food and to make cups to hold liquid food items.

====Trunk====
The tender core of the banana plant's trunk is also used in [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] and [[Southeast Asian cuisine]], and notably in the [[Burma|Burmese]] dish [[mohinga]].

===Fiber===

====Textiles====
Banana fiber harvested from the pseudostems and leaves of the plant has been used for [[textile]]s in Asia since at least the 13th century. Both fruit-bearing and fibrous varieties of the banana plant have been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hendrickx|first1=Katrien|title=The Origins of Banana-fibre Cloth in the Ryukyus, Japan|publisher=Leuven University Press|isbn=9789058676146|page=188|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULyu8dNqS1sC&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=banana%20textile&amp;pg=PA188#v=onepage&amp;q=banana%20textile|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327155254/https://books.google.com/books?id=ULyu8dNqS1sC&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=banana%20textile&amp;pg=PA188#v=onepage&amp;q=banana%20textile|archivedate=March 27, 2018|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Japanese system [[Kijōka-bashōfu]], leaves and shoots are cut from the plant periodically to ensure softness. Harvested shoots are first boiled in [[lye]] to prepare fibers for [[yarn]]-making. These banana shoots produce fibers of varying degrees of softness, yielding yarns and textiles with differing qualities for specific uses. For example, the outermost fibers of the shoots are the coarsest, and are suitable for [[tablecloth]]s, while the softest innermost fibers are desirable for [[kimono]] and [[hakama|kamishimo]]. This traditional Japanese cloth-making process requires many steps, all performed by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =Traditional Crafts of Japan – Kijoka Banana Fiber Cloth |publisher=Association for the Promotion of Traditional Craft Industries |url=http://www.kougei.or.jp/english/crafts/0130/f0130.html |accessdate=December 11, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061104231743/http://www.kougei.or.jp/english/crafts/0130/f0130.html|archivedate= November 4, 2006 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, a banana fiber separator machine has been developed, which takes the agricultural waste of local banana harvests and extracts strands of the fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Entrepreneur Story – Turning Waste from Banana Harvests into Silk Fiber for the Textile Industry|url=http://www.infodev.org/highlights/entrepreneur-story-turning-waste-banana-harvests-silk-fiber-textile-industry|publisher=InfoDev|date=January 5, 2009|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503061310/http://www.infodev.org/highlights/entrepreneur-story-turning-waste-banana-harvests-silk-fiber-textile-industry|archivedate=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religion and popular beliefs====
[[File:XRF-Tani-.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Nang Tani]]'', the female [[ghost]] of Thai folklore that haunts banana plants]]
In all the important festivals and occasions of [[Hindu]]s, the serving of bananas plays a prominent part.

In [[Thailand]], it is believed that [[Musa balbisiana|a certain type]] of banana plants may be inhabited by a [[spirit]], [[Nang Tani]], a type of ghost related to trees and similar plants that manifests itself as a young woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thailand-amulets.net/?p=3485 |title=Banana Tree Prai Lady Ghost |publisher=Thailand-amulets.net |date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108095417/http://thailand-amulets.net/?p=3485 |archivedate=November 8, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often people tie a length of colored satin cloth around the pseudostem of the banana plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thaiworldview.com/bouddha/animism5.htm |title=Spirits |publisher=Thaiworldview.com |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630004429/http://thaiworldview.com/bouddha/animism5.htm |archivedate=June 30, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22638">'''Brake-specific fuel consumption''' ('''BSFC''') is a measure of the [[fuel efficiency]] of any prime mover that burns fuel and produces rotational, or shaft power. It is typically used for comparing the efficiency of [[internal combustion engines]] with a shaft output.

It is the rate of [[fuel]] consumption divided by the [[power (physics)|power]] produced. It may also be thought of as power-[[wiktionary:Specific|specific]] fuel consumption, for this reason. BSFC allows the fuel efficiency of different engines to be directly compared.

==The BSFC calculation (in metric units)==&lt;!--hours are not SI--&gt;

To calculate BSFC, use the formula
:&lt;math&gt; BSFC = \frac{r}{P} &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:''&lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;'' is the fuel consumption rate in grams per second (g/s)
:''&lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt;'' is the power produced in watts where &lt;math&gt;P = \tau \omega&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the engine speed in [[radians per second]] (rad/s)
::&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the engine torque in [[newton meter]]s (N⋅m)

The above values of ''r'', &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; may be readily measured by instrumentation with an engine mounted in a test stand and a load applied to the running engine.  The resulting units of BSFC are [[gram]]s per [[joule]] (g/J)

Commonly BSFC is expressed in units of grams per [[kilowatt-hour]] (g/(kW⋅h)). The conversion factor is as follows:
:BSFC [g/(kW⋅h)] = BSFC [g/J] × (3.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)

The conversion between metric and imperial units is:
:BSFC [g/(kW⋅h)] = BSFC [lb/(hp⋅h)] × 608.277
:BSFC [lb/(hp⋅h)] = BSFC [g/(kW⋅h)] × 0.001644

==The relationship between BSFC numbers and efficiency==
To calculate the actual efficiency of an engine requires the energy density of the fuel being used.

Different fuels have different energy densities defined by the fuel's heating value. The [[lower heating value]] (LHV) is used for internal-combustion-engine-efficiency calculations because the heat at temperatures below {{convert|150|°C|-1|abbr=on}} cannot be put to use.

Some examples of lower heating values for vehicle fuels are:
::Certification [[gasoline]] = 18,640 [[British Thermal Unit|BTU]]/lb (0.01204 kW⋅h/g)
::Regular gasoline   = 18,917 BTU/lb (0.0122222 kW⋅h/g)
::Diesel fuel        = 18,500 BTU/lb (0.0119531 kW⋅h/g)

Thus a diesel engine's efficiency = 1/(BSFC × 0.0119531) and a gasoline engine's efficiency = 1/(BSFC × 0.0122225)

==The use of BSFC numbers as operating values and as a cycle average statistic==
[[File:Brake specific fuel consumption.svg|thumb|290px|right|BSFC [g/(kW⋅h)] map]]
{{main article|Consumption map}}
Any engine will have different BSFC values at different speeds and loads. For example, a reciprocating engine achieves maximum efficiency when the intake air is unthrottled and the engine is running near its peak torque. The efficiency often reported for a particular engine, however, is not its maximum efficiency but a [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] cycle statistical average. For example, the cycle average value of BSFC for a gasoline engine is 322&amp;nbsp;g/(kW⋅h), translating to an efficiency of 25% (1/(322 × 0.0122225) = 0.2540). Actual efficiency can be lower or higher than the engine’s average due to varying operating conditions. In the case of a production gasoline engine, the most efficient BSFC is approximately 225&amp;nbsp;g/(kW⋅h), which is equivalent to a thermodynamic efficiency of 36%&lt;!--correct to 2 sf for premium or regular gasoline--&gt;.

An iso-BSFC map (fuel island plot) of a diesel engine is shown. The sweet spot at 206 BSFC has 40.6% efficiency. The x-axis is rpm; y-axis is [[BMEP]] in [[bar (unit)|bar]] (bmep is proportional to [[torque]])

==The significance of BSFC numbers for engine design and class==

BSFC numbers change a lot for different engine designs, and compression ratio and power rating.  Engines of different classes like diesels and gasoline engines will have very different BSFC numbers, ranging from less than 200&amp;nbsp;g/(kW⋅h) (diesel at low speed and high torque) to more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;g/(kW⋅h) (turboprop at low power level).

==Examples of values of BSFC for shaft engines==
The following table takes values as an example for the specific fuel consumption of several types of engines. For specific engines values can and often do differ from the table values shown below. [[Energy conversion efficiency|Energy efficiency]] is based on a [[lower heating value]] of 42.7 MJ/kg ({{#expr:3600/42.7round1}} g/(kW⋅h)) for [[diesel fuel]] and [[jet fuel]], 43.9 MJ/kg ({{#expr:3600/43.9round1}} g/(kW⋅h)) for gasoline.

The aim is to prevent the release of large quantities of {{co2}} into the atmosphere (from fossil fuel use in power generation and other industries). It is a potential means of [[mitigation of global warming|mitigating]] the contribution of [[fossil fuel emissions]] to [[global warming]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_summaryforpolicymakers.pdf|title=IPCC Special Report Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Summary for Policymakers|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ocean acidification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/introduction-carbon-capture-and-storage/online/43531|title=Introduction to Carbon Capture and Storage - Carbon storage and ocean acidification activity|publisher=Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Global CCS Institute|accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although {{co2}} has been injected into geological formations for several decades for various purposes, including [[enhanced oil recovery]], the long term storage of {{co2}} is a relatively new concept. The first commercial example was the [[Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/JF08/indepth/weyburn.asp Burying the problem.], ''Canadian Geographic Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[SaskPower|SaskPower's]] [[Boundary Dam Power Station|Boundary Dam]]. 'CCS' can also be used to describe the [[Carbon dioxide scrubber|scrubbing]] of {{co2}} from ambient air as a [[climate engineering]] technique.

An integrated pilot-scale CCS power plant was to begin operating in September 2008 in the eastern German power plant [[Schwarze Pumpe power station|Schwarze Pumpe]] run by utility [[Vattenfall]], to test the technological feasibility and economic efficiency. CCS applied to a modern conventional power plant could reduce {{co2}} emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80–90% compared to a plant without CCS.&lt;ref name='IPCC_CC'&gt;[IPCC, 2005] ''IPCC special report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage''. Prepared by working group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Metz, B., O. Davidson, H. C. de Coninck, M. Loos, and L.A. Meyer (eds.). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, 442 pp. Available in full at [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_wholereport.pdf www.ipcc.ch] (PDF - 22.8MB)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] estimates that the economic potential of CCS could be between 10% and 55% of the total carbon mitigation effort until year 2100.&lt;ref name='IPCC_CC'/&gt;

Carbon dioxide can be captured out of air or fossil fuel power plant [[flue gas]] using [[adsorption]] (or [[carbon dioxide scrubber|carbon scrubbing]]), membrane gas separation, or adsorption technologies. Amines are the leading carbon scrubbing technology.
Capturing and compressing {{co2}} may increase the energy needs of a coal-fired CCS plant by 25–40%.&lt;ref name='IPCC_CC'/&gt; These and other system costs are estimated to increase the cost per watt-hour energy produced by 21–91% for fossil fuel power plants.&lt;ref name='IPCC_CC'/&gt; Applying the technology to existing plants would be more expensive, especially if they are far from a sequestration site. A 2005 industry report suggests that with successful research, development and deployment (RD&amp;D), sequestered coal-based electricity generation in 2025 may cost less than unsequestered coal-based electricity generation today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coal.org/roadmap/index.asp Coal Utilization Research Council (CURC) Technology Roadmap], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Storage of the {{co2}} is envisaged either in deep geological formations, or in the form of [[mineral]] [[carbonate]]s. Deep ocean storage is not currently considered feasible due to the associated effect of [[ocean acidification]].&lt;ref name="greenfacts.org"&gt;[http://www.greenfacts.org/en/co2-capture-storage/ Scientific Facts on {{co2}} Capture and Storage], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Geological formations are currently considered the most promising sequestration sites. The [[National Energy Technology Laboratory]] (NETL) reported that North America has enough storage capacity for more than 900 years worth of carbon dioxide at current production rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/carbon_seq/refshelf/atlas/index.html NETL 2007 Carbon Sequestration Atlas], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A general problem is that long term predictions about submarine or underground storage security are very difficult and uncertain, and there is still the risk that {{co2}} might leak into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Phelps | first1=J | last2=Blackford | first2=J | last3=Holt | first3=J | last4=Polton | first4=J | year=2015 | title=Modelling Large-Scale CO2 Leakages in the North Sea | journal=International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control | doi=10.1016/j.ijggc.2014.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capturing {{co2}} is most effective at point sources, such as large fossil fuel or biomass energy facilities, industries with major {{co2}} emissions, [[natural gas processing]], synthetic fuel plants and fossil fuel-based [[hydrogen production]] plants. Extracting {{co2}} from air is also possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/01/carbon_seq/7b1.pdf |title=Capturing Carbon Dioxide From Air |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the far lower concentration of {{co2}} in air compared to combustion sources presents significant engineering challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= May 2018 |url= http://www.geoengineeringmonitor.org/2018/05/direct-air-capture/ |title= Direct Air Capture Technology (Technology Fact Sheet), Geoengineering Monitor |accessdate= 2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisms that produce [[ethanol]] by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] generate cool, essentially pure {{co2}} that can be pumped underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.energycurrent.com/index.php?id=2&amp;storyid=7910 |title= News for the Business of Energy |publisher= Energy Current |accessdate= 2010-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208031230/http://www.energycurrent.com/index.php?id=2&amp;storyid=7910 |archivedate= 2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermentation produces slightly less {{co2}} than ethanol by weight.

Flue gas from the combustion of coal in oxygen has a large concentration of CO2, about 10-15% {{co2}}  whereas natural gas power plant [[flue gas]] is about 5–10% {{co2}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McDonald | first1 = Thomas M. | last2 = Mason | first2 = Jarad A. | last3 = Kong | first3 = Xueqian | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2015| title = Cooperative insertion of {{co2}} in diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 519 | issue = | pages = 303–308 | doi = 10.1038/nature14327 | bibcode = 2015Natur.519..303M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is more energy and cost efficient to capture CO2 from coal-fired power plants.
Impurities in {{co2}} streams, like sulfurs and water, could have a significant effect on their phase behaviour and could pose a significant threat of increased corrosion of pipeline and well materials. In instances where {{co2}} impurities exist, especially with air capture, a scrubbing separation process would be needed to initially clean the flue gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pip-24#carbon-dioxide-purification|title=Good plant design and operation for onshore carbon capture installations and onshore pipelines - 5 Carbon dioxide plant design |publisher=Energy Institute |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Wallula Energy Resource Center in Washington state, by gasifying coal, it is possible to capture approximately 65% of carbon dioxide embedded in it and sequester it in a solid form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wallulaenergy.com/index.tpl?dsp=what |title=Wallula Energy Resource Center |publisher=Wallulaenergy.com |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2010-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715164250/http://www.wallulaenergy.com/index.tpl?dsp=what |archivedate=2010-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, three different configurations of technologies for capture exist: post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxyfuel combustion:

*In ''[[post combustion capture]]'', the {{co2}} is removed after combustion of the fossil fuel&amp;nbsp;— this is the scheme that would be applied to fossil-fuel burning power plants. Here, carbon dioxide is captured from [[flue gas]]es at [[Fossil fuel power plant|power station]]s or other large point sources. The technology is well understood and is currently used in other industrial applications, although not at the same scale as might be required in a commercial scale power station. Post combustion capture is most popular in research because existing fossil fuel power plants can be retrofitted to include CCS technology in this configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sumida | first1 = Kenji | last2 = Rogow | first2 = David L. | last3 = Mason | first3 = Jarad A. | last4 = McDonald | first4 = Thomas M. | last5 = Bloch | first5 = Eric D. | last6 = Herm | first6 = Zoey R. | last7 = Bae | first7 = Tae-Hyun | last8 = Long | first8 = Jeffrey R. | year = 2012 | title = Carbon Dioxide Capture in Metal–Organic Frameworks | url = | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 112 | issue = 2| pages = 724–781 | doi = 10.1021/cr2003272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The technology for ''pre-combustion'' is widely applied in fertilizer, chemical, gaseous fuel (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and power production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/brochures/pdfs/Gasification_Brochure.pdf |title=Gasification Body |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, the fossil fuel is partially oxidized, for instance in a [[gasification|gasifier]]. The resulting [[syngas]] (CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is [[Water gas shift reaction|shifted]] into {{co2}} and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The resulting {{co2}} can be captured from a relatively pure exhaust stream. The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can now be used as fuel; the carbon dioxide is removed before combustion takes place. There are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon dioxide capture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/integrated-gasification-combined-cycle-for-carbon-capture-storage.html integrated gasification combined cycle for carbon capture storage] Claverton Energy Group conference 24th October Bath.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/carboncaptureandstorage|title=Carbon Capture and Storage at Imperial College London|website=Imperial College London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{co2}} is removed after combustion of fossil fuels, but before the flue gas is expanded to atmospheric pressure. This scheme is applied to new fossil fuel burning power plants, or to existing plants where re-powering is an option. The capture before expansion, i.e. from pressurized gas, is standard in almost all industrial {{co2}} capture processes, at the same scale as will be required for utility power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Bryngelsson |first1=Mårten |last2=Westermark |first2=Mats |title=Feasibility study of {{CO2}} removal from pressurized flue gas in a fully fired combined cycle: the Sargas project |conference=Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems |pages=703–10 |year=2005 |url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-10976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2009.01.184 |title={{CO2}} capture pilot test at a pressurized coal fired CHP plant |year=2009 |last1=Bryngelsson |first1=Mårten |last2=Westermark |first2=Mats |journal=Energy Procedia |volume=1 |pages=1403–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[oxy-fuel combustion]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2008.4428318 |title=Winner: Clean Coal - Restoring Coal's Sheen |year=2008 |last1=Sweet |first1=William |journal=IEEE Spectrum |volume=45 |pages=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fuel is burned in oxygen instead of air. To limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion, cooled flue gas is recirculated and injected into the combustion chamber. The flue gas consists of mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour, the latter of which is condensed through cooling. The result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site and stored. Power plant processes based on oxyfuel combustion are sometimes referred to as "zero emission" cycles, because the {{co2}} stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas stream (as in the cases of pre- and post-combustion capture) but the flue gas stream itself. A certain fraction of the {{co2}} generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed water. To warrant the label "zero emission" the water would thus have to be treated or disposed of appropriately. The technique is promising, but the initial air separation step demands a lot of energy.

=== {{co2}} separation technologies ===

Carbon dioxide can be separated out of air or flue gas with [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]], [[adsorption]], or [[membrane gas separation]] technologies. Absorption, or [[carbon dioxide scrubber|carbon scrubbing]], with [[amines]] is currently the dominant capture technology. Membrane and adsorption technologies are still in the developmental research stages, initiating primary pilot plants in the near future. [[Metal-Organic Framework]]s (MOFs) are a novel class of materials that offer promise for carbon capture using adsorption technologies.

Carbon dioxide adsorbs to a MOF through [[physisorption]] or [[chemisorption]] based on the porosity and [[Sensitivity and specificity|selectivity]] of the MOF leaving behind a [[Greenhouse gas]] poor gas stream that is more environmentally friendly. The carbon dioxide is then stripped off the MOF using temperature swing adsorption (TSA) or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) so the MOF can be reused. Adsorbents and absorbents require regeneration steps where the {{co2}} is removed from the sorbent or solution that collected it out of the flue gas in order for the sorbent or solution to be reused. Monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, the leading amine for capturing {{co2}}, have a heat capacity between 3-4 J/g K since they are mostly water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herm | first1 = Zoey R. | last2 = Swisher | first2 = Joseph A. | last3 = Smit | first3 = Berend | last4 = Krishna | first4 = Rajamani | last5 = Long | first5 = Jeffrey R. | year = 2011 | title = Metal−Organic Frameworks as Adsorbents for Hydrogen Purification and Precombustion Carbon Dioxide Capture | url = | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 133 | issue = 15| pages = 5664–5667 | doi = 10.1021/ja111411q }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kulkarni | first1 = Ambarish R. | last2 = Sholl | first2 = David S. | year = 2012 | title = Analysis of Equilibrium-Based TSA Processes for Direct Capture of CO2 from Air | url = | journal = Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research | volume = 51 | issue = 25| pages = 8631–8645 | doi = 10.1021/ie300691c }}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher heat capacities add to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step. Thus, to optimize a MOF for carbon capture, low heat capacities and heats of adsorption are desired. Additionally, high working capacity and high selectivity are desirable in order to capture as much {{co2}} as possible from the flue gas. However, there is an energy trade off with selectivity and energy expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Millward | first1 = Andrew R. | last2 = Yaghi | first2 = Omar M. | year = 2005 | title = Metal−Organic Frameworks with Exceptionally High Capacity for Storage of Carbon Dioxide at Room Temperature | url = | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 127 | issue = 51| pages = 17998–17999 | doi = 10.1021/ja0570032 | pmid=16366539}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the amount of {{co2}} captured increases, the energy, and therefore cost, required to regenerate increases.

Metal reservoirs are also a limiting factor to the potential success of MOFs.&lt;ref&gt;Smit, Berend; Reimer, Jeffrey R.; Oldenburg, Curtis M.; Bourg, Ian C. (2014).

Capture is attributed to about two thirds of the total cost of CCS, making it limit the wide-scale deployment of CCS technologies. To optimize a {{co2}} capture process would significantly increase the feasibility of CCS since the transport and storage steps of CCS are rather mature technologies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

An alternate method under development is [[chemical looping combustion]] (CLC). Chemical looping uses a metal oxide as a solid oxygen carrier. Metal oxide particles react with a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel in a [[fluidization|fluidized bed]] combustor, producing solid metal particles and a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor.  The water vapor is condensed, leaving pure carbon dioxide, which can then be sequestered.  The solid metal particles are circulated to another fluidized bed where they react with air, producing heat and regenerating metal oxide particles that are recirculated to the fluidized bed combustor. A variant of chemical looping is [[calcium looping]], which uses the alternating carbonation and then calcination of a [[calcium oxide]] based carrier as a means of capturing {{co2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-ccs-2011/online/26886#non-power-pcc-applications|title=The Global Status of CCS: 2011 - Capture|publisher=The Global CCS Institute |accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct air capture ===

Direct air capture refers to the process of removing {{co2}} directly from the ambient air (as opposed to from point sources). Combining direct air capture with carbon storage could act as a [[carbon dioxide removal]] technology and as such would constitute a form of [[climate engineering]] if deployed at large scale.

A few engineering proposals have been made for such [[direct air capture]], but work in this area is still in its infancy.&lt;ref name="ReviewDAC2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanz-Pérez|first1=E.

An economic study of this plant in 2018 estimated the cost at US$94-$232 per tonne of atmospheric CO2 removed.

Among the specific chemical processes that are being explored, three stand out: causticization with alkali and alkali-earth hydroxides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Lackner|first1=K. S.|last2=Ziock|first2=H.|last3=Grimes|first3=P.|title=Carbon Dioxide Extraction from Air: Is It an Option?|conference=Proceedings of the 24th Annual Technical Conference on Coal Utilization &amp; Fuel Systems|year=1999|pages=885–896}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[carbonation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nikulshina|first1=V.|last2=Ayesa|first2=N.|last3=Gálvez|first3=M.

and organic−inorganic hybrid sorbents consisting of amines supported in porous [[adsorbents]].

Given that {{co2}} in the atmosphere is highly diluted compared to point-source {{co2}} capture, capture costs are estimated to be higher. Once costs and incentives for [[climate change mitigation]] rise higher later this century, however, they might become attractive for dealing with emissions from diffuse sources such as automobiles and aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://wpweb2.tepper.cmu.edu/ceic/theses/Joshuah_Stolaroff_PhD_Thesis_2006.pdf |title=Capturing {{co2}} from ambient air: a feasibility assessment |type=PhD thesis |first=Joshuah K. |last=Stolaroff |date=August 17, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{Page needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Research Technologies demonstrated a pre-prototype of air capture technology in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/news/2007/story04-24-07.php |title=First Successful Demonstration of Carbon Dioxide Air Capture Technology Achieved by Columbia University Scientist and Private Company |publisher=Earth.columbia.edu |accessdate=2010-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622200945/http://www.earth.columbia.edu/news/2007/story04-24-07.php |archivedate=2010-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport ==
After capture, the {{co2}} would have to be transported to suitable storage sites. This would most likely be done by pipeline, which is generally the cheapest form of transport for large volume of CO2. In 2008, there were approximately 5,800&amp;nbsp;km of {{co2}} pipelines in the United States, used to transport {{co2}} to oil production fields where it is then injected into older fields to extract oil. The injection of {{co2}} to produce oil is generally called ''[[enhanced oil recovery]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In addition, there are several pilot programs in various stages to test the long-term storage of {{co2}} in non-oil producing geologic formations.

According to the Congressional Research Service, "There are important unanswered questions about pipeline network requirements, economic regulation, utility cost recovery, regulatory classification of {{co2}} itself, and pipeline safety. Furthermore, because {{co2}} pipelines for enhanced oil recovery are already in use today, policy decisions affecting {{co2}} pipelines take on an urgency that is unrecognized by many. Federal classification of {{co2}} as both a commodity (by the [[Bureau of Land Management]]) and as a pollutant (by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]) could potentially create an immediate conflict which may need to be addressed not only for the sake of future CCS implementation, but also to ensure consistency of future CCS with {{co2}} pipeline operations today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Paul W. |last1=Parfomak |first2=Peter |last2=Folger |title=CRS Report for Congress: Carbon Dioxide ({{co2}}) Pipelines for Carbon Sequestration: Emerging Policy Issues", Updated January 17, 2008 (Order Code RL33971) |format=PDF |url=http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL33971_20080117.pdf |publisher=Assets.opencrs.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911225918/http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL33971_20080117.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Adam |last1=Vann |first2=Paul W. |last2=Parfomak |title=CRS Report for Congress: Regulation of Carbon Dioxide ({{co2}}) Sequestration Pipelines: Jurisdictional Issues", Updated April 15, 2008 (Order Code RL34307) |format=PDF |url=http://ncseonline.org/nle/crs/abstract.cfm?NLEid=2051 |publisher=Ncseonline.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208194215/http://ncseonline.org/NLE/CRs/abstract.cfm?NLEid=2051 |archivedate=February 8, 2010 |df= }} (reviewing federal jurisdictional issues related to {{co2}} pipelines and reviewing agency jurisdictional determinations under the Interstate Commerce Act and the Natural Gas Act)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ships could also be utilized for transport where pipelines are not feasible. These methods are currently used for transporting {{co2}} for other applications.

== Sequestration ==
{{Main|Carbon sequestration}}

Various forms have been conceived for permanent storage of {{co2}}. These forms include gaseous storage in various deep geological formations (including saline formations and exhausted gas fields), and solid storage by reaction of {{co2}} with metal [[oxide]]s to produce stable [[carbonate]]s.

=== Geological storage ===

Also known as ''geo-sequestration'', this method involves injecting carbon dioxide, generally in [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] form, directly into underground geological formations. [[Oil field]]s, [[gas field]]s, saline formations, unmineable [[coal seam]]s, and saline-filled basalt formations have been suggested as storage sites. Various physical (e.g., highly impermeable [[caprock]]) and geochemical trapping mechanisms would prevent the {{co2}} from escaping to the surface.&lt;ref name="Energy Institute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pip-13|title=Good plant design and operation for onshore carbon capture installations and onshore pipelines - Storage|publisher=Energy Institute|accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{co2}} is sometimes injected into declining oil fields to [[enhanced oil recovery|increase oil recovery]]. Approximately 30 to 50 million metric tonnes of {{co2}} are injected annually in the United States into declining oil fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_chapter5.pdf |title=IPCC "Special Report on Carbon Capture and Storage, pp. 181 and 203 (Chapter 5, "Underground Geological Storage") |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This option is attractive because the geology of hydrocarbon reservoirs is generally well understood and storage costs may be partly offset by the sale of additional oil that is recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pip-20#co2-storage-associated-with-eor|title=Good plant design and operation for onshore carbon capture installations and onshore pipelines - Carbon dioxide storage|publisher=Energy Institute|accessdate=2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disadvantages of old oil fields are their geographic distribution and their limited capacity, as well as the fact that subsequent burning of the additional oil recovered will offset much or all of the reduction in {{co2}} emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/lowcarbon/ccs/index_en.htm |title=Carbon Capture and Geological Storage - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unmineable coal seams can be used to store {{co2}} because the {{co2}} molecules attach to the surface of coal. The technical feasibility, however, depends on the permeability of the coal bed. In the process of absorption the coal releases previously absorbed [[methane]], and the methane can be recovered ([[enhanced coal bed methane recovery]]). The sale of the methane can be used to offset a portion of the cost of the {{co2}} storage. Burning the resultant methane, however, would negate some of the benefit of sequestering the original {{co2}}.

Saline formations contain highly mineralized brines, and have so far been considered of no benefit to humans. Saline aquifers have been used for storage of chemical waste in a few cases. The main advantage of saline aquifers is their large potential storage volume and their common occurrence. The major disadvantage of saline aquifers is that relatively little is known about them, especially compared to oil fields. To keep the cost of storage acceptable, the geophysical exploration may be limited, resulting in larger uncertainty about the aquifer structure. Unlike storage in oil fields or coal beds, no side product will offset the storage cost. Leakage of {{co2}} back into the atmosphere may be a problem in saline aquifer storage. Current research shows, however, that ''trapping mechanisms'' such as structural trapping, residual trapping, solubility trapping and mineral trapping could immobilize the {{co2}} underground and reduce the risk of leakage.&lt;ref name="Energy Institute"/&gt;


===== Carbon Dioxide Storage with Carbon Dioxide Degrading Bacterium =====
An alternative to geochemical injection would instead be to physically store carbon dioxide in containers with a bacteria that could degrade the carbon dioxide. It would ultimately be ideal to exploit the carbon dioxide metabolizing bacterium ''Clostridium thermocellum'' in such theoretical CO2 storage containers.  &lt;ref&gt;"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/10/27/1605482113.full
&lt;/ref&gt; Using this bacteria would prevent overpressurization of such theoretical carbon dioxide storage containers. 

==== Enhanced oil recovery ====
[[Enhanced oil recovery]] (EOR) is a generic term for techniques used to increase the amount of [[crude oil]] that can be extracted from an [[oil field]]. In carbon capture and sequestration enhanced oil recovery (CCS EOR), carbon dioxide is injected into an oil field to recover oil that is often never recovered using more traditional methods.

[[Crude oil]] development and production in U.S. oil reservoirs can include up to three distinct phases: primary, secondary, and tertiary (or enhanced) recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Phases Of Oil Recovery|url=http://www.chinaoilfieldtech.com/oilrecovery.html|website=chinaoilfieldtech.com|publisher=China Oilfield Technology|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201359/http://www.chinaoilfieldtech.com/oilrecovery.html|archivedate=2014-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During primary recovery only about 10 percent of a [[Oil reservoir|reservoir's]] original oil in place is typically produced. Secondary recovery techniques extend a field's productive life generally by injecting water or gas to displace oil and drive it to a production [[wellbore]], resulting in the recovery of 20 to 40 percent of the original oil in place. However, with much of the easy-to-produce oil already recovered from U.S. oil fields, producers have attempted several tertiary, or enhanced oil recovery, techniques that offer prospects for ultimately producing 30 to 60 percent, or more, of the reservoir's original oil in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enhanced Oil Recovery|url=http://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/oil-gas-research/enhanced-oil-recovery|website=energy.gov|publisher=US DOE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a project that will use CCS EOR is the [[Kemper Project]] in [[Mississippi]]. Due to the Kemper Project's close proximity to oil fields, the [[carbon dioxide]] [[byproduct]] from producing [[electricity]] will be transported to the neighboring [[oil fields]] for enhanced oil recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Carbon Captures Perfect Storm|url=http://kemperproject.org/blog/2014/08/18/carbon-captures-perfect-storm/|publisher=Kemper Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ocean storage ===

==== Framework Convention On Climate Change ====

Held in 1992, the results from this climate convention are the most widely agreed upon for addressing the problem of climate change and the use of sinks of greenhouse gases. Ocean storage of {{co2}} has been pointed out a viable option of mitigating the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, the convention also states that there should be precautionary measures taken to mitigate any detriments to the environment. Therefore, with this convention, ocean storage may prove to be a way to store carbon dioxide efficiently, especially in places where it is cost effective such as Norway.&lt;ref name="mit.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sequestration.mit.edu/pdf/Legal_Implications_Ocean_Storage.pdf |title=Legal Implications of CO2 Ocean Storage |first=Jason |last=Heinrich |date=July 2002 |access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== London Convention ====
Taken place in 1972 with more than 70 members, the result of the London Convention is that it prohibits all ocean dumping without the direct approval of a national authority. In 1991, an addendum also prohibited the dumping of all radioactive and industrial waste, making it unclear and debated to today whether or not carbon dioxide falls under industrial waste. The London Convention also applies to sea-faring vessels such as ships, planes, and offshore drilling platforms. If these types of vessels want to dump carbon dioxide into the ocean, they must get permission from their respective national authority.&lt;ref name="mit.edu"/&gt;

The 1996 Protocol to the London Convention went even further by prohibiting carbon dioxide storage that comes from sea-based storage. In 1997, the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine environmental Protection stated that until there was 2/3 majority vote, any dumping of carbon dioxide from ships was in direct violation of the London Convention.&lt;ref name="mit.edu"/&gt;

==== OSPAR Convention ====

Also occurring in 1992, this convention was set up to protect the North East Atlantic Ocean. The convention was more certain in its results from the meeting. The first is that it prohibited carbon dioxide from going to a storage site through a petroleum platform and also prohibited transport by ship. It did however, allow transport of carbon dioxide through a pipeline from land to a site that did not require the use of a platform used for gas exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 2009|title=International marine regulation of CO2 geological storage.

In the past, it was suggested that {{co2}} could be stored in the oceans, but this would only exacerbate [[ocean acidification]] and has been made illegal under specific regulations. Ocean storage is no longer considered feasible.&lt;ref name="greenfacts.org"/&gt;

=== Mineral storage ===
In this process, {{co2}} is [[exothermic]]ally reacted with available metal oxides, which in turn produces stable carbonates (e.g. [[calcite]], [[magnesite]]). This process occurs naturally over many years and is responsible for a great amount of surface [[limestone]].  The idea of using [[olivine]] has been promoted by the geochemist Prof. Schuiling.&lt;ref name="Olivine weathering"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schuiling|first=Olaf|title=Olaf Schuiling proposes olivine rock grinding|url=http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474979949059|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411003510/http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474979949059|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-04-11|accessdate=2011-12-23}}{{self-published inline|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction rate can be made faster, for example, with a [[catalyst]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bhaduri |first= Gaurav A. |last2= Šiller |first2= Lidija |date= 17 January 2013 |title= Nickel nanoparticles catalyse reversible hydration of carbon dioxide for mineralization carbon capture and storage |url= http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/cy/c3cy20791a |journal= [[Catalysis Science &amp; Technology]] |publisher= [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |volume= 3 |issue= 5 |pages= 1234–1239 |doi= 10.1039/C3CY20791A |access-date= 13 February 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by reacting at higher temperatures and/or pressures, or by pre-treatment of the minerals, although this method can require additional energy. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] estimates that a power plant equipped with CCS using mineral storage will need 60–180% more energy than a power plant without CCS.&lt;ref name='IPCC_CC'/&gt;

The economics of mineral carbonation at scale are now being tested in a world-first pilot plant project based in Newcastle, Australia. New techniques for mineral activation and reaction have been developed the GreenMag Group and the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] and funded by the [[New South Wales]] and Australian Governments to be operational by 2013.&lt;ref name="www.dpi.nsw.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/minerals/resources/low-emissions-coal/nsw-clean-coal-fund-research-projects#Storage-of-Captured-Carbon-Dioxide-(CO-sub-2--sub-) |title=GreenMag-Newcastle Mineral Carbonation Pilot Plant|publisher=www.dpi.nsw.gov.au |date=2010-06-06 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 it was reported that scientists had mapped {{convert|6000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of rock formations in the U.S. that could be used to store 500 years' worth of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/environment/090309-co2-rock-map.html Rocks Found That Could Store Greenhouse Gas], Live Science, March 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A study on mineral sequestration in the US states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Carbon sequestration by reacting naturally occurring Mg and Ca containing minerals with {{co2}} to form carbonates has many unique advantages. Most notabl[e] is the fact that carbonates have a lower energy state than {{co2}}, which is why mineral carbonation is thermodynamically favorable and occurs naturally (e.g., the weathering of rock over geologic time periods). Secondly, the raw materials such as magnesium based minerals are abundant. Finally, the produced carbonates are unarguably stable and thus re-release of {{co2}} into the atmosphere is not an issue. However, conventional carbonation pathways are slow under ambient temperatures and pressures. The significant challenge being addressed by this effort is to identify an industrially and environmentally viable carbonation route that will allow mineral sequestration to be implemented with acceptable economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Goldberg, Chen, O'Connor, Walters, and Ziock |year=1998 |title= {{co2}} Mineral Sequestration Studies in US |publisher= National Energy Technology Laboratory |accessdate=June 7, 2007 |url=

== Leakage ==
[[File:Tml15-16 Nc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Lake Nyos]] as it appeared fewer than two weeks after the eruption; August 29, 1986.]]

A major concern with CCS is whether leakage of stored {{co2}} will compromise CCS as a climate change mitigation option. For well-selected, designed and managed geological storage sites, IPCC estimates that risks are comparable to those associated with current hydrocarbon activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_technicalsummary.pdf |title=IPCC Special Report: Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Technical Summary |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this finding is contested due to a lack of experience in such long term storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/tt/en/Portaldata/41/Resources/dokumente/institut/system/publications/JGGC_CCS_Paper_Viebahn_etal.pdf|title=Comparison of carbon capture and storage with renewable energy technologies regarding structural, economic, and ecological aspects in Germany|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Sydney: Global warming effect of leakage from CO2 storage|url=http://www.isa.org.usyd.edu.au/publications/ISA_CCSleakage.pdf|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{co2}} could be trapped for millions of years, and although some leakage occurs upwards through the soil, well selected storage sites are likely to retain over 99% of the injected {{co2}} over 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-beccs-projects-2010/online/27051#storage-security|title=Global Status of BECCS Projects 2010 - Storage Security|accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leakage through the injection pipe is a greater risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plein66.nl/documents/1024/artikel_CO2-opslag.pdf Natuurwetenschap &amp; Techniek; April 2009; CCS leakage risks] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the injection pipe is usually protected with [[non-return valve]]s to prevent release on a power outage, there is still a risk that the pipe itself could tear and leak due to the pressure. The [[Berkel en Rodenrijs]] incident in December 2008 was an example, where a modest release of {{CO2}} from a pipeline under a bridge resulted in the deaths of some ducks sheltering there.&lt;ref name=eenden&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkelenrodenrijs.net/main.php?lees=3329|title=Eendensterfte door lek in CO2-leiding (Duck deaths from leaking CO2 pipeline)|date=March 2013}} (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; In order to measure accidental carbon releases more accurately and decrease the risk of fatalities through this type of leakage, the implementation of {{co2}} alert meters around the project perimeter has been proposed. Malfunction of a carbon dioxide industrial fire suppression system in a large warehouse released {{CO2}} and 14 citizens collapsed on the nearby public road. A release of {{CO2}} from a salt mine killed a person at distance of 300 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ssci.2011.10.004 |title=The extreme carbon dioxide outburst at the Menzengraben potash mine 7 July 1953 |year=2012 |last1=Hedlund |first1=Frank Huess |journal=Safety Science |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=537–53 | url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/7931421/Menzen_53_submit_to_Orbit_.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 a large leakage of naturally sequestered {{co2}} rose from [[Lake Nyos]] in [[Cameroon]] and asphyxiated 1,700 people. While the carbon had been sequestered naturally, some point to the event as evidence for the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestering carbon artificially.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pentland |first=William |title=The Carbon Conundrum |work=Forbes |date=6 October 2008 |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/06/carbon-sequestration-biz-energy-cx_wp_1007capture.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lake Nyos]] disaster resulted from a volcanic event, which very suddenly released as much as a cubic kilometre of {{CO2}} gas from a pool of naturally occurring {{CO2}} under the lake in a deep narrow valley. The location of this pool of {{CO2}} is not a place where man can inject or store {{CO2}}, and this pool was not known about nor monitored until after the occurrence of the natural disaster.

For ocean storage, the retention of {{co2}} would depend on the depth. The IPCC estimates 30–85% of the sequestered carbon dioxide would be retained after 500 years for depths 1000–3000 m. Mineral storage is not regarded as having any risks of leakage. The IPCC recommends that limits be set to the amount of leakage that can take place. This might rule out deep ocean storage as an option.

At the conditions of the deeper oceans, (about 400 bar or 40 MPa, 280 K) water–{{co2}}(l) mixing is ''very'' low (where carbonate formation/acidification is the rate limiting step), but the formation of water-{{co2}} hydrates, a kind of solid water cage that surrounds the {{co2}}, is favorable.

To further investigate the safety of {{co2}} sequestration, Norway's [[Sleipner gas field]] can be studied, as it is the oldest plant that stores {{co2}} on an industrial scale. According to an environmental assessment of the gas field which was conducted after ten years of operation, the author affirmed that geosequestration of {{co2}} was the most definite form of permanent ''geological'' storage of {{co2}}:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Available geological information shows absence of major tectonic events after the deposition of the Utsira formation [saline reservoir]. This implies that the geological environment is tectonically stable and a site suitable for carbon dioxide storage. The solubility trapping [is] the most permanent and secure form of geological storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wagner |first=Leonard |title=Carbon Capture and Storage |publisher=Moraassociates.com |year=2007 |url=http://www.moraassociates.com/publications/0701%20Carbon%20capture%20and%20storage.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321214944/http://www.moraassociates.com/publications/0701%20Carbon%20capture%20and%20storage.pdf |archivedate=March 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Phase I of the [[Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project]] in [[Weyburn, Saskatchewan]], Canada has determined that the likelihood of stored {{co2}} release is less than one percent in 5,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Casey, ''Carbon Cemetery'', Canadian Geographic Magazine, Jan/Feb 2008, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; A January 2011 report, however, claimed [[Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project#Claims of leaking|evidence of leakage]] in land above that project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The liability of potential leak(s) is one of the largest barriers to large-scale CCS. To assess and reduce such liability, the leakage of stored gasses, particularly [[carbon dioxide]], into the atmosphere may be detected via atmospheric gas monitoring, and can be quantified directly via the [[eddy covariance]] flux measurements,&lt;ref&gt;US DOE, 2012.

== Monitoring geological sequestration sites ==

In order to detect carbon dioxide leaks and the effectiveness of geological sequestration sites, different monitoring techniques can be employed to verify that the sequestered carbon stays trapped below the surface in the intended reservoir. Leakage due to injection at improper locations or conditions could result in carbon dioxide being released back into the atmosphere. It is important to be able to detect leaks with enough warning to put a stop to it, and to be able to quantify the amount of carbon that has leaked for purposes such as [[cap and trade]] policies, evaluation of environmental impact of leaked carbon, as well as accounting for the total loss and cost of the process. To quantify the amount of carbon dioxide released, should a leak occur, or to closely watch stored {{co2}}, there are several monitoring methods that can be done at both the surface and subsurface levels.&lt;ref name=main&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smit|first1=Berend|last2=Reimer|first2=Jeffery A.|last3=Oldenburg|first3=Curtis M.|last4=Bourg|first4=Ian C.|title=Introduction to Carbon Capture and Sequestration|publisher=Imperial College Press|edition=The Berkeley Lectures on Energy - Vol. 1|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsurface monitoring ===
In subsurface monitoring, there are direct and indirect methods to determine the amount of {{co2}} in the reservoir. A direct method would be drilling deep enough to collect a fluid sample. This drilling can be difficult and expensive due to the physical properties of the rock. It also only provides data at a specific location. Indirect methods would be to send sound or electromagnetic waves down to the reservoir where it is then reflected back up to be interpreted. This approach is also expensive but it provides data over a much larger region; it does however lack precision. Both direct and indirect monitoring can be done intermittently or continuously.&lt;ref name="main" /&gt;

=== Seismic monitoring ===
[[Seismometer|Seismic monitoring]] is a type of indirect subsurface monitoring. It is done by creating vibrational waves either at the surface using a [[Seismic vibrator|vibroseis truck]], or inside a well using [[Rotating unbalance|spinning eccentric mass]].  These vibrational waves then propagate through the geological layers and reflect back creating patterns that are read and interpreted by seismometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biondi|first1=Biondo|last2=de Ridder|first2=Sjoerd|last3=Chang|first3=Jason|title=Continuous passive - seismic monitoring of CO2 geologic sequestration projects|date=2013|url=https://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/TechReports2013/5.2_Biondi_Public_Version_2013.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can identify migration pathways of the {{co2}} plume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Offshore Monitoring for CCS Projects|url=http://ieaghg.org/member/49-publications/technical-reports/590-2015-02-review-of-offshore-monitoring-for-ccs-projects|website=IEAGHG|publisher=IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of monitoring geological sequestration sites using seismic monitoring are the [[Sleipner gas field|Sleipner sequestration project]] and the Frio {{co2}} Injection test. Although this method can confirm the presence of {{co2}} in a given region, it cannot determine the specifics of the environment or concentration of {{co2}}.

=== Surface monitoring ===

[[Eddy covariance]] is a surface monitoring technique that measures the flux of {{co2}} from the ground's surface. It involves measuring {{co2}} concentrations as well as vertical wind velocities using an anemometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madsen|first1=Rod|last2=Xu|first2=Liukang|last3=Claassen|first3=Brent|last4=McDermitt|first4=Dayle|title=Surface Monitoring Method for Carbon Capture and Storage Projects|journal=Energy Procedia|date=February 2009|volume=1|issue=1|pages=2161–2168|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610209002823|accessdate=7 May 2016|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2009.01.281}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides a measure of the total vertical flux of CO2. Eddy covariance towers could potentially detect leaks, however, the natural carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and the respiration of plants, would have to be accounted for and a baseline {{co2}} cycle would have to be developed for the location of monitoring. An example of Eddy covariance techniques used to monitor carbon sequestration sites is the [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/397007sh Shallow Release test]. Another similar approach is utilizing accumulation chambers. These chambers are sealed to the ground with an inlet and outlet flow stream connected to a gas analyzer.&lt;ref name="main" /&gt; This also measures the vertical flux of {{co2}}. The disadvantage of accumulation chambers is its inability to monitor a large region which is necessary in detecting {{co2}} leaks over the entire sequestration site.

=== InSAR monitoring ===
[[InSAR]] monitoring is another type of surface monitoring. It involves a satellite sending signals down to the Earth's surface where it is reflected back to the satellite's receiver. From this, the satellite is able to measure the distance to that point.&lt;ref name=insar&gt;{{cite web|title=InSAR—Satellite-based technique captures overall deformation "picture"|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vhp/insar.html|website=USGS Science for a Changing World|publisher=US Geological Survey|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In CCS, the injection of {{co2}} in deep sublayers of geological sites creates high pressures. These high pressured, fluid filled layers affect those above and below it resulting in a change of the surface landscape. In areas of stored {{co2}}, the ground's surface often rises due to the high pressures originating in the deep subsurface layers. These changes in elevation of the Earth's surface corresponds to a change in the distance from the inSAR satellite which is then detectable and measurable.&lt;ref name="insar" /&gt;

== Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) ==
{{Main|Carbon neutral fuel}}

Carbon capture and use may offer a response to the global challenge of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major stationary (industrial) emitters in the near to medium term,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Given that it does not result in geological storage of carbon dioxide, it represents a different technological category from CCS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mineral carbonation and industrial uses of carbon dioxide|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_chapter7.pdf|accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies under development, such as Bio CCS Algal Synthesis,&lt;ref name="globalccsinstitute.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/accelerating-uptake-ccs-industrial-use-captured-carbon-dioxide/online/28516|title=Accelerating the uptake of CCS: Industrial use of captured carbon dioxide - Appendix E: CO2 for use in algae cultivation|publisher=Global CCS Institute and Parsons Brinckerhoff|accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; utilises pre-smokestack {{CO2}} (such as from a coal-fired power station) as a useful feedstock input to the production of oil-rich algae in solar membranes to produce oil for plastics and transport fuel (including aviation fuel), and nutritious stock-feed for farm animal production.&lt;ref name="globalccsinstitute.com"/&gt; The {{CO2}} and other captured greenhouse gases are injected into the membranes containing waste water and select strains of algae causing, together with sunlight or UV light, an oil rich biomass that doubles in mass every 24 hours{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}.

The Bio CCS Algal Synthesis process is based on earth science photosynthesis: the technology is entirely retrofittable and collocated with the emitter, and the capital outlays may offer a return upon investment due to the high value commodities produced (oil for plastics, fuel and feed).

Bio CCS Algal Synthesis test facilities were being trialed at Australia's three largest coal-fired power stations (Tarong, Queensland; Eraring, NSW; Loy Yang, Victoria) using piped pre-emission smokestack {{CO2}} (and other greenhouse gases) as feedstock to grow oil-rich algal biomass in enclosed membranes for the production of plastics, transport fuel and nutritious animal feed.

Another potentially useful way of dealing with industrial sources of {{co2}} is to convert it into hydrocarbons where it can be stored or reused as fuel or to make plastics. There are a number of projects investigating this possibility.&lt;ref name='newsci2645'&gt;New Scientist No2645, 1 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon dioxide scrubber|Carbon dioxide scrubbing]] variants exist based on [[potassium carbonate]] which can be used to create liquid fuels, though this process requires a great deal of energy input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/science/19carb.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Scientists Would Turn Greenhouse Gas Into Gasoline | first=Kenneth | last=Chang | date=2008-02-19 | accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the creation of fuel from atmospheric {{co2}} does not result in [[carbon dioxide removal]] as carbon dioxide is re-released when the fuel is burned. Therefore, synfuels do not represent a [[climate engineering]] technique. Nevertheless, they are potentially useful as net-zero-carbon fuel.

Other uses are the production of stable carbonates from silicates (e.g. [[olivine]] produces [[magnesium carbonate]]). These processes are still under research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Capture and Utilization Using CO2 to manufacture fuel, chemicals, and materials|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/policy_library/data/01612|accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Single step methods: methanol ===
A proven process to produce a hydrocarbon is to make [[methanol]].  Methanol is easily synthesized from {{co2}} and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Based on this fact the idea of a [[methanol economy]] was born.

=== Single step methods: hydrocarbons ===
At the department of Industrial Chemistry and Engineering of Materials at the University of Messina, Italy, there is a project to develop a system which works like a fuel-cell in reverse, whereby a catalyst is used that enables sunlight to split water into hydrogen ions and oxygen gas. The ions cross a membrane where they react with the {{co2}} to create hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;David Biello:[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chemical-process-makes-fu Chemical Process Makes Fuel from Carbon Dioxide] Scientific American September 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Two step methods ===
If {{co2}} is heated to 2400&amp;nbsp;°C, it splits into carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen. The [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] can then be used to convert the CO into hydrocarbons. The required temperature can be achieved by using a chamber containing a mirror to focus sunlight on the gas. Rival teams are developing such chambers, at Solarec and at [[Sandia National Laboratories]], both based in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/new-machine-turns-co2-into-fuel/ |title=Researchers Build Machine That Turns CO2 Into Fuel &amp;#124; Inhabitat - Sustainable Design Innovation, Eco Architecture, Green Building |publisher=Inhabitat |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sandia these chambers could provide enough fuel to power 100% of domestic vehicles using 5800&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; unlike biofuels this would not take fertile land away from crops but would be land that is not being used for anything else. [[James May]], the British TV presenter, visited a demonstration plant in a programme in his [[James May's Big Ideas|Big Ideas]] series.

== Example CCS projects ==

=== Industrial-scale projects ===
As of September 2012, the Global CCS Institute identified 75 large-scale integrated projects in its 2012 Global Status of CCS report&lt;ref name="The Global CCS Institute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-ccs-2012/online/47976|title=The Global Status of CCS: 2012 - Projects|publisher=The Global CCS Institute |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a net increase of one project since its 2011 Global Status of CCS report. 16 of these projects are in operation or in construction capturing around 36 million tonnes of {{CO2}} per annum.&lt;ref name="The Global CCS Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdn.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-ccs-2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310000154/http://cdn.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-ccs-2011 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-10 |title=The Global Status of CCS: 2011 &amp;#124; Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute |publisher=Cdn.globalccsinstitute.com |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2013-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For more information see Integrated CCS Projects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/projects/browse |title=Large-scale |publisher=Globalccsinstitute.com |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Global CCS Institute's website.

The eight large-scale integrated CCS projects currently in operation are:

==== In Salah {{CO2}} Injection — [[Algeria]] ====
[[In Salah]] is a fully operational onshore gas field with {{CO2}} injection. {{CO2}} is separated from produced gas and reinjected in the producing hydrocarbon reservoir zones. Since 2004, about 1 Mt/a of {{CO2}} has been captured during [[natural gas]] extraction and injected into the Krechba geologic formation at a depth of 1,800m. The Krechba formation is expected to store 17Mt {{CO2}} over the life of the project.

Injection suspended in 2011 due to concerns about the integrity of the seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/in_salah.html|title=Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies @ MIT|website=sequestration.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sleipner {{CO2}} Injection — Norway ====
{{Main|Sleipner gas field}}
Sleipner&lt;ref name="Energy-pedia"/&gt; is a fully operational offshore gas field with {{CO2}} injection initiated in 1996. {{CO2}} is separated from produced gas and reinjected in the Utsira saline aquifer (800–1000&amp;nbsp;m below ocean floor) above the hydrocarbon reservoir zones. This aquifer extends much further north from the Sleipner facility at its southern extreme. The large size of the reservoir accounts for why 600 billion tonnes of {{CO2}} are expected to be stored, long after the Sleipner natural gas project has ended.

==== Snøhvit {{CO2}} Injection — Norway ====
Snøhvit is a fully operational offshore gas field with {{CO2}} injection. The LNG plant is located onshore. {{CO2}} is necessarily separated to produce [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) and then {{CO2}} is injected in a saline aquifer below the hydrocarbon reservoir zones offshore at a rate of 700,000 t/a into the Tubåen [[sandstone]] formation 2,600 m under the seabed for storage. This formation was closed April 2011, and injection started in the Stø-formation where produced gas is taken. Produced {{CO2}} is increasing, therefore separation capacity may limit production before end 2015 when a new formation will be drilled for {{CO2}}-injection only. (Teknisk Ukeblad nr. 30, 2013, tu.no)

==== Great Plains Synfuel Plant and Weyburn-Midale Project — Canada ====
Weyburn-Midale is a [[coal gasification]] operation that produces synthetic natural gas and various petrochemicals from coal. This project captures about 2.8 Mt/a of {{CO2}} from its coal gasification plant located in [[North Dakota]], US, transported by pipeline 320&amp;nbsp;km across the Canada–US border and injects it into depleting oil fields in Saskatchewan where it is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

==== Shute Creek Gas Processing Facility — US ====
Around 7 million tonnes per annum of carbon dioxide are recovered from [[ExxonMobil]]'s Shute Creek gas processing plant in [[Wyoming]], and transported by pipeline to various oil fields for enhanced oil recovery. This project has been operational since 1986.

==== Enid Fertilizer — US ====
The Enid Fertilizer plant sends 675,000 tonnes of {{CO2}} to be used for EOR. The pipeline and wells are operated separately by Anadarko Petroleum.

==== Val Verde Natural Gas Plants — US ====
{{CO2}} from Mitchell, Gray Ranch, Puckett, and Turrell gas processing plants is transported via the Val Verde and CRC pipelines{{where|date=March 2014}} for EOR (incl. Sharon Ridge{{clarify|date=March 2014}} EOR field).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==== Century Plant — US ====
[[Occidental Petroleum]], along with [[Sandridge Energy]], is operating a West Texas hydrocarbon gas processing plant and related pipeline infrastructure that provides {{co2}} for use in [[Enhanced oil recovery|EOR]]. With a total {{co2}} capture capacity of 8.5 Mt/a expected in 2012, the Century plant would be the largest single industrial source {{co2}} capture facility in North America.

==== Duke Energy East Bend Station  — US ====
Researchers at the Center for Applied Energy Research of the [[University of Kentucky]] are currently developing the algae-mediated conversion of coal-fired power plant flue gas to drop-in hydrocarbon fuels. Through their work, these researchers have proven that the carbon dioxide within [[flue gas]] from [[coal-fired power plants]] can be captured using algae, which can be subsequently harvested and utilized, e.g. as a feedstock for the production of drop-in hydrocarbon fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Catalytic deoxygenation of triglycerides and fatty acids to hydrocarbons over Ni–Al layered double hydroxide|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259517260_Catalytic_deoxygenation_of_triglycerides_and_fatty_acids_to_hydrocarbons_over_NiAl_layered_double_hydroxide|website = ResearchGate|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Algae CO2 Capture Part 1: How it Works {{!}} reveal.uky.edu|url = http://reveal.uky.edu/algae_part1_howitworks|website = reveal.uky.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-08|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150603030404/http://reveal.uky.edu/algae_part1_howitworks#|archive-date = 2015-06-03|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Petra Nova  — US ====
The [[Petra Nova]] project is a billion dollar endeavour taken upon by NRG Energy and JP Nippon to retrofit their jointly owned W.A Parish coal-fired power plant with post-combustion carbon capture. The plant, which is located in Thompsons, Texas (just outside of Houston), entered commercial service in 1977, and carbon capture began operation on January 10, 2017. The plant generates 240 MW and 90% of the CO2 (or 1.4 million tonnes) is captured per year. The carbon dioxide captured (99% purity) from the power plant is compressed and piped about 82 miles to West Ranch Oil Field, Texas, where it will be used for enhanced oil recovery. The field has a capacity of 60 million barrels of oil and is expected to increase oil production by a factor of 506. This project is expected to run for at least another 20 years.

=== Canada ===
The federal government in the 2008 and 2009 budgets has invested approximately $1.4 billion in Carbon Capture and Storage development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_CA/ca/industries/energyandresources/1f769be5d3752210VgnVCM100000ba42f00aRCRD.htm |title=Carbon Capture and Storage in Canada |publisher=Deloitte |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709011856/http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_CA/ca/industries/energyandresources/1f769be5d3752210VgnVCM100000ba42f00aRCRD.htm |archivedate=2011-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alberta ====
Alberta has committed $170 million in 2013/2014 – and a total of $1.3 billion over 15 years – to fund two large-scale CCS projects that will help reduce {{CO2}} emissions from tar sands refining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/Initiatives/1438.asp |title=Alberta Energy: Carbon Capture and Storage |publisher=Energy.alberta.ca |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a grant agreement was signed with the [[Alberta Carbon Trunk Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enhanceenergy.com/ |title=Enhance Energy Inc. &amp;#124; Enhanced Oil Recovery, Carbon Capture and Storage|publisher=Enhanceenergy.com |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is the Quest Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shell.ca/en/aboutshell/our-business-tpkg/business-in-canada/upstream/oil-sands/quest.html |title=Quest project Canada |publisher=Shell.ca |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2010-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231155052/http://www.shell.ca/en/aboutshell/our-business-tpkg/business-in-canada/upstream/oil-sands/quest.html |archivedate=2012-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quest project uses amine absorption to capture {{co2}} from the Scotford Steam Methane Reformer units.

===== Quest Carbon Capture and Storage Project =====
[[Quest Carbon Capture and Storage Project]] captures and stores underground one million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year. The capture unit is located at the Scotford Upgrader in Alberta, Canada, where hydrogen is produced to&amp;nbsp;[[Upgrader|upgrade]]&amp;nbsp;bitumen from&amp;nbsp;[[oil sands]]&amp;nbsp;into synthetic crude oil.

===== Weyburn Project =====
The objective of the [[Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project]] is to increase oil production and extend the oil field's lifetime through Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) by injecting the captured CO2 from the Dakota Gasification Company's Great Plains Synfuels Plant in North Dakota and SaskPower's coal-fired Boundary Dam Power Station in Saskatchewan, Canada into the Weyburn oilfields.

==== Saskatchewan ====
Led by the provincially owned utility, SaskPower, one of the world's first and largest full production carbon capture facilities is operating at the coal fired [[Boundary Dam Power Station]]. With an initial investment of $1.5 to $1.6 billion. Of the 90% of CO2 emissions captured, about a half of this will be sold and permanently sequestered in enhanced oil recovery. The remainder is released into the atmosphere during capturing, and processing in the oil field.&lt;ref&gt;http://grist.org/climate-energy/turns-out-the-worlds-first-clean-coal-plant-is-a-backdoor-subsidy-to-oil-producers/&lt;/ref&gt; The project started in May 2011 and became operational in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SaskPower launches world's first commercial CCS process |url=http://www.saskpower.com/about-us/media-information/news-releases/saskpower-launches-worlds-first-commercial-ccs-process/ |work=SaskPower  |date=2 October 2014 |accessdate=10 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The post-combustion full flue gas capture process was to capture 1 million tonnes of {{CO2}} a year.&lt;ref name="Canadian CCS Projects"/&gt; Since opening serious design issues were found in the carbon capture system, resulting in maintenance problems that led to operating only 40% of the time. In 2016 the contracts to sell CO2 were renegotiated to reflect the reduced sales.

=== Norway ===
In Norway, the {{CO2}} Technology Centre (TCM) at [[Mongstad]] began construction in 2009, and completed in 2012. It includes two capture technology plants (one advanced amine and one chilled ammonia), both capturing fluegas from two sources. This includes a gas-fired power plant and refinery cracker fluegas (similar to coal-fired power plant fluegas).

In addition to this, the Mongstad site was also planned to have a full-scale CCS demonstration plant. The project was delayed to 2014, 2018, and then indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Webmaster Gassnova |url=http://www.tcmda.com |title=TCM homepage |publisher=Tcmda.com |accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project cost rose to US$985 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Norway Boosts Mongstad Carbon-Storage Site Cost to $985 Million | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/norway-boosts-mongstad-carbon-storage-site-cost-to-985-million.html |author = Marianne Stigset | date = 2011-11-06 | publisher = Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, four different [[synthetic fuel]] projects are moving forward, which have publicly announced plans to incorporate carbon capture and storage:

# American Clean Coal Fuels, in their Illinois Clean Fuels (ICF) project, is developing a {{convert|30000|oilbbl|m3|adj=on}} per day biomass and [[coal to liquids]] project in [[Oakland, Illinois]], which will market the {{co2}} created at the plant for enhanced oil recovery applications. By combining sequestration and [[biomass]] feedstocks, the ICF project will achieve dramatic reductions in the life-cycle carbon footprint of the fuels they produce. If sufficient biomass is used, the plant should have the capability to go life-cycle carbon negative, meaning that effectively, for each gallon of their fuel that is used, carbon is pulled out of the air, and put into the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleancoalfuels.com/cleancoalfuels_projects.html |title=American Clean Coal Fuels |publisher=Cleancoalfuels.com |accessdate=2010-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409023541/http://cleancoalfuels.com/cleancoalfuels_projects.html |archivedate=2010-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded grants to twelve Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage (ICCS) projects to conduct a Phase 1 feasibility study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fossil.energy.gov/recovery/projects/industrial_ccs.html |title=DOE&amp;nbsp;— Fossil Energy: Industrial CCS projects from Recovery Act |publisher=Fossil.energy.gov |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DOE plans to select 3 to 4 of those projects to proceed into Phase 2, design and construction, with operational startup to occur by 2015. [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], Pacific Northwest Division, Boise, Inc., and [[Fluor Corporation]] are studying a CCS system for capture and storage of {{co2}} emissions associated with the pulp and paper production industry. The site of the study is the Boise White Paper L.L.C. paper mill located near the township of Wallula in Southeastern Washington State. The plant generates approximately 1.2 MMT of {{co2}} annually from a set of three recovery boilers that are mainly fired with black liquor, a recycled byproduct formed during the pulping of wood for paper-making. Fluor Corporation will design a customized version of their Econamine Plus carbon capture technology. The Fluor system also will be designed to remove residual quantities of remnant air pollutants from stack gases as part of the {{co2}} capture process. Battelle is leading preparation of an Environmental Information Volume (EIV) for the entire project, including geologic storage of the captured {{co2}} in deep flood basalt formations that exist in the greater region. The EIV will describe the necessary site characterization work, sequestration system infrastructure, and monitoring program to support permanent sequestration of the {{co2}} captured at the plant.{{update inline|date=February 2018}}

In addition to individual carbon capture and sequestration projects, there are a number of U.S. programs designed to research, develop, and deploy CCS technologies on a broad scale. These include the National Energy Technology Laboratory's (NETL) Carbon Sequestration Program, regional carbon sequestration partnerships and the [[Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum]] (CSLF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/carbon_seq/index.html NETL Carbon Sequestration] NETL Web site.

==== SECARB ====
In October 2007, the Bureau of Economic Geology at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] received a 10-year, $38 million subcontract to conduct the first intensively monitored long-term project in the United States studying the feasibility of injecting a large volume of {{co2}} for underground storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/102407.html |title=Bureau of Economic Geology Receives $38 Million for First Large-Scale U.S. Test Storing Carbon Dioxide Underground |publisher=Jsg.utexas.edu |date=2007-10-24 |accessdate=2010-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182402/http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/102407.html |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is a research program of the Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (SECARB), funded by the [[National Energy Technology Laboratory]] of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE).

The SECARB partnership will demonstrate {{co2}} injection rate and storage capacity in the Tuscaloosa-Woodbine geologic system that stretches from Texas to Florida. The region has the potential to store more than 200 billion tons{{Vague|date=September 2008}} of {{co2}} from major point sources in the region, equal to about 33 years of overall U.S. emissions at present rates. Beginning in fall 2007, the project will inject {{co2}} at the rate of one million tons{{Vague|date=September 2008}} per year, for up to 1.5 years, into brine up to 10,000 feet (3,000 m) below the land surface near the Cranfield oil field, which lays about {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[Natchez, Mississippi]]. Experimental equipment will measure the ability of the subsurface to accept and retain {{co2}}.

The $1.4 billion [[FutureGen]] power generation and carbon sequestration demonstration project, announced in 2003 by President [[George W. Bush]], was cancelled in 2015, due to delays and inability to raise required private funding.

==== Gorgon Carbon Dioxide Injection Project ====
The [[Gorgon Carbon Dioxide Injection Project]] is part of the Gorgon Project, the world's largest natural gas project. The Gorgon Project, located on Barrow Island in Western Australia, includes a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, a domestic gas plant, and a Carbon Dioxide Injection Project.

The initial carbon dioxide injections were planned to take place by the end of 2017. Once launched, the Gorgon Carbon Dioxide Injection Project will be the world's largest {{CO2}} injection plant, with an ability to store up to 4 million tons of {{CO2}} per year – approximately 120 million tons over the project's lifetime, and 40 percent of total Gorgon Project emissions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The project started extracting gas in February 2017, but carbon capture and storage is now not expected to begin until the first half of 2019, requiring a further five million tonnes of {{CO2}} to be released, because:

=== The Planet Venus ===

[[Terraforming]] the planet [[Venus]] by removing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere was first scholarly proposed by the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] in 1961,&lt;ref name="The Planet Venus"&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Science| date=1961| title=The Planet Venus| first=Carl| last=Sagan| doi=10.1126/science.133.3456.849| bibcode=1961Sci...133..849S |pmid=17789744| volume=133|issue=3456| pages=849–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Venus in fiction|fictional treatments]], such as ''The Big Rain'' of [[The Psychotechnic League]] by novelist [[Poul Anderson]], preceded it. Adjustments to the existing environment of Venus to support human life would require at least three major changes to the planet's atmosphere:&lt;ref name="Landis2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landis|first1=Geoffrey|title=Terraforming Venus: A Challenging Project for Future Colonization|year=2011|url= https://info.aiaa.org/tac/SMG/SCTC/Shared%20Documents/Terraforming-Venus_AIAA_Space2011.pdf|doi=10.2514/6.2011-7215}} Paper AIAA-2011-7215, AIAA Space 2011 Conference &amp; Exposition, Long Beach CA, Sept. 26–29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing Venus's surface temperature of {{convert|462|C|F}}, eliminating most of the planet's dense {{convert|9.2|MPa|atm|abbr=on}} [[carbon dioxide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] [[Atmosphere of Venus|atmosphere]] via removal or conversion to some other form, and the addition of breathable [[oxygen]] to the atmosphere. These three changes are closely interrelated, because Venus's extreme temperature is due to the high pressure of its dense atmosphere, and the [[greenhouse effect]].

== Limitations of CCS for power stations ==
Critics say large-scale CCS deployment is unproven and decades away from being commercialized. They say that it is risky and expensive and that a better option is [[renewable energy]]. Some environmental groups point out that CCS technology leaves behind dangerous waste material that has to be stored, just like nuclear power stations.&lt;ref name = ti12&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1954176_1954175_1955868,00.html |title=Cutting Carbon: Should We Capture and Store It? |author=Simon Robinson |date=22 January 2012 |work=TIME }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another limitation of CCS is its energy penalty - the reduction in overall plant efficiency due to the carbon capturing process. It has been estimated that about 60% of the energy penalty originates from the capture process itself, 30% comes from compression of {{CO2}}, while the remaining 10% comes from electricity requirements for necessary pumps and fans.&lt;ref name="Rubin2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=E.S.|last2=Mantripragada|first2=H.|last3=Marks|first3=A.|last4=Versteeg|first4=P.|last5=Kitchin|first5=J.|title=The outlook for improved carbon capture technology|journal=Progress in Energy and Combustion Science|date=2012|volume=38|issue=5|pages=630–671|doi=10.1016/j.pecs.2012.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCS technology is expected to use between 10 and 40 percent of the energy produced by a power station.&lt;ref name="falsehope"&gt;Rochon, Emily et al.

Wide-scale adoption of CCS may erase efficiency gains in coal power plants of the last 50 years, and increase [[resource consumption]] by one third. Even taking the fuel penalty into account, however, overall levels of {{co2}} abatement would remain high at approximately 80–90%, compared to a plant without CCS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_wholereport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for CCS, when combined with biomass, to result in net negative emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rhodes | first1 = J.

The use of CCS can reduce {{CO2}} emissions from the stacks of coal power plants by 85–90% or more, but it has no effect on {{CO2}} emissions due to the mining and transport of coal. It will actually "increase such emissions and of air pollutants per unit of net delivered power and will increase all ecological, land-use, air-pollution, and water-pollution impacts from coal mining, transport, and processing, because the CCS system requires 25% more energy, thus 25% more coal combustion, than does a system without CCS".&lt;ref name=WWS2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtI.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z. |author2=Delucchi, Mark A. |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy |page=4 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern regards the permanence of storage schemes. Opponents to CCS claim that safe and permanent storage of {{co2}} cannot be guaranteed and that even very low leakage rates could undermine any climate mitigation effect.&lt;ref name="falsehope"/&gt; In 1986 a large leakage of naturally sequestered {{co2}} rose from [[Lake Nyos]] in [[Cameroon]] and asphyxiated 1,700 people. While the carbon had been sequestered naturally, some point to the event as evidence for the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestering carbon artificially.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name = ti12/&gt;

On one hand, [[Greenpeace]] claims that CCS could lead to a doubling of coal plant costs.&lt;ref name="falsehope"/&gt; It is also claimed by opponents to CCS that money spent on CCS will divert investments away from other solutions to climate change. On the other hand, CCS is pointed out as economically attractive in comparison to other forms of low carbon electricity generation and seen by the [[IPCC]] and others as a critical component for meeting [[Climate change mitigation scenarios|mitigation targets]] such as 450 ppm and 350 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file32014.pdf |title=20244 DTI Energy Review_AW |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415132136/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file32014.pdf |archivedate=2010-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A POLICY STRATEGY FOR CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE|url=http://www.iea.org/papers/2012/policy_strategy_for_ccs.pdf|publisher=[[International Energy Agency]]|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyer|first=Leo|title=CCS in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|url=http://www.ieaghg.org/docs/CCS%20financing%20pdfs/C%20-%20Meyer%20-%20IPCC.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost ==

Although the processes involved in CCS have been demonstrated in other industrial applications, no commercial scale projects which integrate these processes exist; the costs therefore are somewhat uncertain. Some recent credible estimates indicate that the cost of capturing and storing carbon dioxide is US$60 per ton,&lt;ref name="Science323"&gt;Science, 27 February 2009, Vol 323, p. 1158, "Stimulus Gives DOE Billions for Carbon-Capture Project"&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to an increase in electricity prices of about US 6c per kWh (based on typical coal-fired power plant emissions of {{convert|2.13|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} {{co2}} per kWh). This would double the typical US industrial electricity price (now at around 6c per kWh) and increase the typical retail residential electricity price by about 50% (assuming 100% of power is from coal, which may not necessarily be the case, as this varies from state to state). Similar (approximate) price increases would likely be expected in coal dependent countries such as Australia, because the capture technology and chemistry, as well as the transport and injection costs from such power plants would not, in an overall sense, vary significantly from country to country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The reasons that CCS is expected to cause such power price increases are several. Firstly, the increased energy requirements of capturing and compressing {{co2}} significantly raises the operating costs of CCS-equipped power plants. In addition, there are added investment and capital costs. The process would increase the fuel requirement of a plant with CCS by about 25% for a coal-fired plant, and about 15% for a gas-fired plant.&lt;ref name='IPCC_CC'/&gt; The cost of this extra fuel, as well as storage and other system costs, are estimated to increase the costs of energy from a power plant with CCS by 30–60%, depending on the specific circumstances. Pre-commercial CCS demonstration projects are likely to be more expensive than mature CCS technology; the total additional costs of an early large-scale CCS demonstration project are estimated to be €0.5-1.1 billion per project over the project lifetime. Other applications are possible. In the belief that use of sequestered carbon could be harnessed to offset the cost of capture and storage, Walker Architects published the first {{co2}} gas [[Compressed air energy storage|CAES]] application, proposing the use of sequestered {{co2}} for Energy Storage on October 24, 2008. To date the feasibility of such potential offsets to the cost have not been examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= CCS&amp;nbsp;— Assessing the Economics |publisher= Mckinsey.com |year= 2008 |url= http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/ccsi/pdf/CCS_Assessing_the_Economics.pdf |format= PDF |access-date= 2008-11-15 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081120124311/http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/ccsi/pdf/CCS_Assessing_the_Economics.pdf# |archive-date= 2008-11-20 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of CCS depends on the cost of capture and storage, which varies according to the method used. Geological storage in saline formations or depleted oil or gas fields typically cost US$0.50–8.00 per tonne of {{co2}} injected, plus an additional US$0.10–0.30 for monitoring costs. When storage is combined with [[enhanced oil recovery]] to extract extra oil from an oil field, however, the storage could yield net benefits of US$10–16 per tonne of {{co2}} injected (based on 2003 oil prices). This would likely negate some of the effect of the carbon capture when the oil was burnt as fuel. Even taking this into account, as the table above shows, the benefits do not outweigh the extra costs of capture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Governments around the world have provided a range of different types of funding support to CCS demonstration projects, including tax credits, allocations and grants. The funding is associated with both a desire to accelerate innovation activities for CCS as a low-carbon technology and the need for economic stimulus activities. As of 2011, approximately US$23.5bn has been made available to support large-scale CCS demonstration projects around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-ccs-2011/online/26916|title=Global Status of CCS Report:2011|publisher=Global CCS Institute|accessdate=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carbon capture and storage and the Kyoto Protocol ===
One way to finance future CCS projects could be through the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. At [[COP16]] in 2010, The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, at its thirty-third session, issued a draft document recommending the inclusion of Carbon dioxide capture and storage in geological formations in Clean Development Mechanism project activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abclive.in/news/environment/clean-engergy/490-sbsta-global-carbon-dioxide-capture-and-storage-data-cop16.html SBSTA Presents Global Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage Data at COP16] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728190701/http://abclive.in/news/environment/clean-engergy/490-sbsta-global-carbon-dioxide-capture-and-storage-data-cop16.html |date=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[COP17]] in [[Durban]], a final agreement was reached enabling CCS projects to receive support through the Clean Development Mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonner|first=Mark|title=CCS enters the CDM at CMP 7|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/community/blogs/authors/markbonner/2011/12/10/ccs-enters-cdm-cmp-7|publisher=Global CCS Institute|accessdate=7 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124063149/http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/community/blogs/authors/markbonner/2011/12/10/ccs-enters-cdm-cmp-7|archivedate=24 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental effects ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2009}}

The theoretical merit of CCS systems is the reduction of {{co2}} emissions by up to 90%, depending on plant type. Generally, environmental effects from use of CCS arise during power production, {{co2}} capture, transport, and storage. Issues relating to storage are discussed in those sections.

Additional energy is required for {{co2}} capture, and this means that substantially more fuel has to be used to produce the same amount of power, depending on the plant type. For new super-critical pulverized coal (PC) plants using current technology, the extra energy requirements range from 24 to 40%, while for natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants the range is 11–22% and for coal-based gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems it is 14–25% [IPCC, 2005].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_technicalsummary.pdf |title=IPCC Special Report: Carbon Capture and Storage Technical Summary. IPCC. p. 27 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously, fuel use and environmental problems arising from mining and extraction of coal or gas increase accordingly. Plants equipped with [[flue-gas desulfurization]] (FGD) systems for [[sulfur dioxide]] control require proportionally greater amounts of [[limestone]], and systems equipped with [[selective catalytic reduction]] systems for [[NOx|nitrogen oxides produced during combustion]] require proportionally greater amounts of [[ammonia]].

IPCC has provided estimates of air emissions from various CCS plant designs (see table below). While {{co2}} is drastically reduced though never completely captured, emissions of air pollutants increase significantly, generally due to the energy penalty of capture. Hence, the use of CCS entails a reduction in air quality. Type and amount of air pollutants still depends on technology. {{CO2}} is captured with alkaline solvents catching the acidic {{CO2}} at low temperatures in the absorber and releasing {{CO2}} at higher temperatures in a desorber. Chilled Ammonia CCS Plants have inevitable ammonia emissions to air. "Functionalized Ammonia" emit less ammonia, but amines may form secondary amines and these will emit volatile nitrosamines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekopolitan.com/news/ccs-norway-amines-nitrosamines-and-nitramines-released-carbon-capture-proce|title=CCS - Norway: Amines, nitrosamines and nitramines released in Carbon Capture Processes should not exceed 0.3 ng/m3 air  (The Norwegian Institute of Public Health) - ekopolitan|website=www.ekopolitan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a side reaction with nitrogendioxide, which is present in any flue gas even after DeNOx. Nevertheless, there are advanced amines in testing with little to no vapor pressure to avoid these amine- and consecutive nitrosamine emissions. Nevertheless, all the capture plants amines have in common, that practically 100% of remaining sulfur dioxide from the plant is washed out of the flue gas, the same applies to dust/ash.

'''Charles Greeley Abbot''' (May 31, 1872 – December 17, 1973) was an [[United States|American]] [[astrophysicist]] and the fifth secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], serving from 1928 until 1944.&lt;ref name=SIAMain&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Greely Abbott, 1872-1973|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/charles-greely-abbot|work=Smithsonian History|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Archives]]|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roberts, Walter Orr|authorlink=Walter Orr Roberts|title=Charles Greeley Abbot|journal=Physics Today|date=May 1974|volume=27|issue=5|pages=65–67|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v27/i5/p65_s1?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.3128601|bibcode=1974PhT....27e..65R|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927175148/http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v27/i5/p65_s1?bypassSSO=1|archivedate=2013-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbot went from being director of the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]], to becoming Assistant Secretary, and then Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution over the course of his career. As an astrophysicist, he researched the [[solar constant]], research that led him to invent the [[solar cooker]], [[solar boiler]], [[solar still]], and other patented [[solar energy]] inventions.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Charles Greeley Abbot at Age Eleven.jpg|thumb|left|Abbot, at age eleven, with the [[water wheel]] he invented.]]
Charles Greeley Abbot was born in [[Wilton, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name=SIAMain/&gt;&lt;ref name=Devorkin /&gt; His parents were farmers and he was the youngest of four children.&lt;ref name=Devorkin /&gt; As a youth he built and invented numerous things, such as a [[forge]] to fix tools, a [[water wheel]] to power a [[saw]], and a [[bicycle]]. He dropped out of school when he was 13 to become a [[carpenter]]. Two years later he went back to [[high school]].&lt;ref name=ObitA /&gt; He attended [[Phillips Andover Academy]].&lt;ref name=SIAMain /&gt;&lt;ref name=ObitA /&gt; 
When a friend of his went to [[Boston]] to take the entrance exam to get into the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Abbot went for the chance to visit Boston. However, upon arrival, he was uncomfortable visiting Boston alone and chose to take the exam instead. He passed and his family gathered the funds to send him to MIT for one year. He started out studying [[chemical engineering]], but eventually moved on to [[physics]].&lt;ref name=ObitA /&gt;

He would graduate in 1894 with a [[Master of Science]] in [[physics]].&lt;ref name=SIAMain/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Abbey, C.G. |edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;{{cite web|last=Warner|first=Deborah Jean|title=Biographical Memoirs: Charles Greeley Abbot|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_3703|work=The American Philosophical Society Year Book 1975|publisher=The American Philosophical Society|accessdate=11 April 2012|pages=111–116|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbot would meet [[Samuel P. Langley]] on MIT campus when Langley visited seeking an assistant.&lt;ref name=ObitA /&gt; In 1895, he would start working as an aid at the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]].&lt;ref name=SIAMain/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref name=SOA1&gt;{{cite web|title=Abbot Becomes Director of SAO|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_2375|work=Institutional History Division|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory==
[[File:Identified! (21899747561) (LOC).jpg|thumb|Charles Greeley Abbot, between 1913 and 1917]]
While at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), Abbot would work under [[Samuel P. Langley]]. Langley would go on to change his focus from [[solar radiation]] to [[aeronautics]], with Abbot taking over solar radiation research. Abbot would participate in many [[expeditions]]. In 1900 he, along with Langley, would travel to [[Wadesboro, North Carolina]] to observe a [[solar eclipse]],&lt;ref name=NC&gt;{{cite web|title=North Carolina Eclipse Expedition of 1900|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_12981|work=Institutional History Division|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by another eclipse expedition to [[Sumatra]] in 1901. During his expedition experiences he would also travel to [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], and other countries, often in partnership with the [[National Geographic Society]]. Abbot would become acting director of SAO in 1906&lt;ref name=SOA1 /&gt; and in 1907, Abbot became the Director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, following the death of Samuel P. Langley.&lt;ref name=SIAMain/&gt; While Langley was still Director, he had visited [[Mount Whitney]], and decided it would be a great place for an observatory. Abbot secured funding for the observatory and it was built in 1909.&lt;ref name=WhitneyA&gt;{{cite web|title=SAO Mount Whitney Shelter Erected|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_11842|work=Institutional History Division|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Director, a position he would hold until his retirement, Abbot would open the Radiation Biology Laboratory in 1929, to study radiation effects on plants, and other organisms.&lt;ref name=SIAMain/&gt;&lt;ref name=radiation&gt;{{cite web|title=Div. of Radiation and Organisms Established|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_704|work=Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution for the year 1953|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This helped to develop the first wave of [[biophysics]] researchers in the United States.&lt;ref name=SIAMain/&gt;

==Life and work as Smithsonian Secretary==
[[File:Secretary Abbot with Printouts.jpg|thumb|Abbot with a container full of printouts of solar observations, 1968]]
Abbot would become the Assistant Secretary at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1918,&lt;ref name=SIAMain/&gt; upon the death of [[Frederick W. True]].&lt;ref name=AssSec&gt;{{cite web|title=C. G. Abbot Named Assistant Secretary|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_218?back=%2Fsearch%2Fsia_search_collections%2FC.%2520G.%2520Abbot%2520Named%2520Assistant%2520Secretary|work=Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution for the year|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives|accessdate=11 April 2012|page=3|year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his role as Assistant Secretary he would oversee the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]], the [[International Exchange Service]], and the SAO.&lt;ref name=AssSec /&gt; He also co-created the ''Smithsonian Scientific Series'' books, which helped raise funds for the Smithsonian.&lt;ref name=Devorkin /&gt;

Ten years later, on January 10, 1928, he became the fifth Secretary of the Smithsonian after the death of [[Charles Doolittle Walcott]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Abbot would also maintain his position as Director of the Astrophysical Observatory. In 1927, Walcott had finalized the Smithsonian's [[strategic plan]], which Abbot took on responsibility for upon his election as Secretary. The Smithsonian began a [[capital campaign]] in 1929, coinciding with the start of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. During this tenure, Abbot oversaw the Smithsonian's participation in [[Works Progress Administration]] projects, including the [[Federal Art Project]]. Projects included new buildings and artwork at the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]], and the start of the Smithsonian's first media project, a [[radio show]] called ''The World is Yours''.&lt;ref name=SIAMain/&gt; The program would be ceased in 1942 due to [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=WorldIsYours&gt;{{cite web|title=World Is Yours is Suspended|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_1013|work=Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution for the year 1942|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1930s an expansion was approved for the [[National Museum of Natural History]] building, which would not begin until the 1960s. The [[Institute for Social Anthropology]] was also transferred to the Smithsonian during this time.&lt;ref name=SIAMain/&gt; While Secretary, Abbot would fail to acquire the [[National Gallery of Art]] for the Smithsonian. Abbot's role in the [[United States National Museum]] was also minimal, and was under the primary care of Assistant Secretary [[Alexander Wetmore]].&lt;ref name=Devorkin /&gt;

He was the first Smithsonian Secretary to retire, ending his tenure on July 1, 1944. Following retirement, he was awarded Secretary Emeritus status&lt;ref name=SIAMain/&gt; and proceeded to continue his research work.&lt;ref name=Retire1&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles G. Abbot Retires as Secretary|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_733|work=Annual Report for the Smithsonian Institution for the year 1945.|publisher=Government Printing Office|accessdate=11 April 2012|location=Washington, DC|page=7|year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Smithsonian holiday party would be held during his tenure. At the party, Abbot sang and played the [[cello]] for the partygoers. While in Washington, he was a [[deacon]] at the First Congregational Church. He also played [[tennis]] frequently at the former tennis courts at the Smithsonian Castle.&lt;ref name=SIAMain/&gt;

==Later life and legacy==
On May 31, 1955, the Smithsonian held a [[birthday party]] for Abbot, marking his 83rd birthday and his 60th year of association with the Smithsonian. The event was held at the [[Smithsonian Castle]] and a bronze [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Abbot, by [[Alicia Neatherly]], was presented, and donated to the [[National Gallery of Art]].&lt;ref name=Birthday&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebration of Abbot's 83rd Birthday|url=http://siris-sihistory.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=133411X7GS015.1017&amp;profile=sicall&amp;source=~!sichronology&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!779~!18&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=power&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=Abbot&amp;index=.GW&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=power&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1&amp;limitbox_1=LO01+=+sch|work=Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution for the year 1955|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=11 April 2012|page=10|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Greeley Abbot died, at age 101 in [[Maryland]], on December 17, 1973.&lt;ref name=SIAMain/&gt;&lt;ref name=Death&gt;{{cite web|title=Secretary Emeritus Abbot Dies|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_1212|work=Torch|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives|accessdate=11 April 2012|page=1|date=1 January 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Solar Energy Society]] has an award named in Abbot's honor, which is awarded for contributions to [[solar energy]] research.&lt;ref name=ASES&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Greeley Abbot Award|url=http://www.asesdev.org/about/charles-greeley-abbot-award|publisher=American Solar Energy Society|accessdate=11 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126131449/http://www.asesdev.org/about/charles-greeley-abbot-award|archivedate=26 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abbot (crater)|Abbot]] crater on the [[Moon]] has been named after him.

==Research work==
[[File:Secretary Charles G. Abbot's Solar Cooker at Mt. Wilson, CA.jpg|thumb|right|Abbot's [[solar cooker]] at Mount Wilson Observatory.]]
Abbot began his [[astrophysics]] research focusing on solar radiation before proceeding to chart cyclic patterns found in [[solar variation]]s. With this research he hoped to track [[solar constant]] in order to make weather pattern predictions.&lt;ref name=SIAMain/&gt; He believed that the sun was a [[variable star]] which effected the weather on Earth, which was criticized by many contemporaries. In 1953, he discovered a connection between solar variations and planetary climate. This discovery allowed general climate patterns to be predicted 50 years in advance.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; He did field work at the [[Smithsonian Institution Shelter]], which was built during his tenure as director at SAO, [[Lick Observatory]], and [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. At Lick, he worked with [[W.W. Campbell]]. To fight critics, Abbot would utilize [[balloons]] with [[pyrheliometer]]s installed on them for measurements. He was the first scientist in America to do so, with the balloons reaching upwards of 25 kilometers. One balloon returned data that allowed Abbot to determine the solar constant at the highest point of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Later in his research career, he turned his focus on [[solar energy]] use.&lt;ref name=Devorkin /&gt;

The '''Chrysler Sebring''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|b|r|ɪ|ŋ}} {{respell|SEE|bring}}) is a line of [[mid-size car|mid-size]] [[luxury car|luxury automobiles]] that was sold from 1995 through 2010 by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]]. Three generations of convertibles, two generations of sedans, and two generations of coupes were produced. Although the coupe shared the same name and some styling cues, it was mechanically unrelated to the other Sebring models.

The Sebring line was introduced in 1995 with the Chrysler Sebring coupe. It was the replacement for the [[Chrysler Lebaron#1987.E2.80.931995 coup.C3.A9.2Fconvertible|Chrysler LeBaron coupe]]. In 1996 the convertible was introduced, replacing its [[Chrysler Lebaron#1987.E2.80.931995 coup.C3.A9.2Fconvertible|LeBaron counterpart]] as well. For 2001, both body styles were redesigned and a sedan version was offered, replacing the [[Chrysler Cirrus]]. The coupe was discontinued after 2005 with no replacement model planned.

The redesigned sedan was introduced for 2007, and a convertible the following year. New options included all-wheel drive on sedans and a hardtop for the convertible. All Sebring models were replaced by the [[Chrysler 200]] for the 2011 model year.

The Chrysler Sebring was introduced as a [[coupe]] for 1995, and as a convertible in 1996, both models replacing the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] convertible and coupe. The convertible was built off the [[Chrysler JA platform]] also used for the [[Chrysler Cirrus|Cirrus]] sedan, while the coupe was based on the [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]]. The Chrysler Sebring was named after [[Sebring, Florida]], the site of the renowned endurance car race called the ''[[12 Hours of Sebring]]''. The name was first used by Chrysler Corporation's [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] division trim line of the [[Plymouth Satellite|Satellite]] [[mid-size]] [[coupe]] of the 1970s.

===Coupe (1995–2000)===

[[File:1995-1996 Chrysler Sebring LX coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1997–2000 Chrysler Sebring coupe]]

The 1995 through 2000 '''Chrysler Sebring''' [[coupe]] was the successor to the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] coupe.

The first generation Sebring coupe was introduced in April 1995, several months after the related [[Dodge Avenger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/model/sebring.html "The First Generation Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Avenger coupes" Information courtesy of Chrysler, allpar], retrieved on 2012–07–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its similarities to the Avenger, the Chrysler's suspension was tuned slightly on the softer side compared to Dodge's stiff suspension. Although the Sebring did not really offer true "off-the-line" muscle, it did handle well over long, curvy roads, offering minimal body roll. LXi models further benefited from rear sway bars, a slightly different tuned fully independent suspension, along with 17-inch wheels wrapped with Goodyear Eagle performance tires. Recorded slalom speeds proved to be impressive for a car of its class, and were a result of Sebring's 4-wheel double wishbone suspension and variable speed rack and pinion steering; both of which were key contributors to the car's road manners.

The coupe version of the Sebring had seating for five and was considered to be one of the larger, more roomy coupes on the market. Trunk capacity was similar to that of many mid-size cars, capable of handling more than one  set of golf clubs. At the time of its introduction, the Sebring sported a crosshair grille, reminiscent of the original [[Chrysler 300 letter series]]. The grille was non-functional, with the lower half under the bumper used for air flow intake in a "[[bottom breather]]" function.

Although said to be built on a stretched [[Eagle Talon]] platform (which is not entirely untrue), it is more accurate to say that their platform was based on the four-door [[Mitsubishi Galant]] platform.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} However, these cars do share a great deal with their Talon sibling, including much of their dash and instrument panel along with select suspension and steering components.

[[File:1997-2000 Chrysler Sebring LXi coupe -- 03-21-2012 2.JPG|thumb|left|1997–2000 Chrysler Sebring coupe]]

The Sebring underwent a minor facelift for 1997. Its grille was replaced with a slightly larger black grid. The facelift also made the Sebring the first car to use Chrysler's "wings" logo. The 1997 restyle also saw the addition of ribbed lower body cladding and new wheel styles.

Features offered on Sebring coupes included 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS, adaptive automatic transmissions and fully independent suspensions, along with a host of power operated features. Sebring also offered variable speed rack and pinion steering, 17&amp;nbsp;inch aluminum wheels with GoodYear Eagle tires, 4-wheel double wishbone suspension, one-touch power windows, one-touch moonroof, electrochromic mirror with compass, power accessory delay ignition (which allowed occupants to operate power window switches when ignition is turned off), and Homelink universal transmitter, among other options.

Sebring coupe received a 5-star frontal safety rating, the highest rating possible.

First generation bodystyle coupes continued to be sold past the 2000 model year to select export models

[[File:Chrysler Sebring Convertible rear 20081218.jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler Sebring convertible]]

The Sebring convertible was launched in 1996 alongside the Sebring coupe, replacing the LeBaron convertible. The convertible didn't share any sheetmetal with the coupe and was instead based on the [[Chrysler Cirrus]] sedan. Consequently, both the Cirrus and Sebring convertible were sold in Europe as the Stratus. All Stratus convertibles were sourced from Mexico. The Chrysler Stratus convertible was actually available in Mexico, but the sedan version was not. The Sebring convertible was sold alongside with the Chrysler Stratus convertible in Mexico. In Mexico, a rare turbocharged 2.4 L DOHC I4 engine was optional.

The Sebring name was then used on three different cars for 2001: the coupe was based on the [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]], while the [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and [[convertible (car)|convertible]] were [[Chrysler JR platform]] successors to the [[Chrysler Cirrus]]. The 2004 Chrysler Sebring had received minor tweaks to its front-end: a redesigned grille, re-worked headlights, and a Chrysler winged emblem placed in the center on the rear deck; furthermore, after the 2004 Chrysler Sebring sedan had seen a mild cycle refresh, the company discontinued the Chrysler Sebring coupe after model year 2005. And outside of the United States, and Canada, over into Mexico, the Sebring was sold as the '''Chrysler Cirrus'''. Exclusive for the Cirrus was the availability of Chrysler's turbocharged 2.4 L DOHC engine. The Cirrus available as a sedan, and convertible body-styles.  Models with this engine are identified with a "High Output" badge on the back of the vehicle. Also unique to the Cirrus was the number of trim levels; the sedan was offered in two while the convertible was only offered in one.  All were equipped with an automatic transmission.

The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] gives the 2001–2006 Sebring an ''Acceptable'' overall rating in frontal crash tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=30 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Dodge Stratus |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2006-03-29 |accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the side impact test, a ''Poor'' overall rating was given to models without side airbags.  The IIHS did not test the Sebring with side airbags since Chrysler declined another test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=281 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Dodge Stratus |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2006-03-03 |accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convertible===

[[File:Chrysler Sebring Cabriolet Limited rear.jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler Sebring Limited cabriolet (Europe)]]
For 2001, the Sebring Convertible was redesigned. It now closely resembled the [[sedan (car)|sedan]], though it still differed greatly from it and the coupe. The front fascia and most of the interior were the only features that these cars had in common. Many interior and exterior components were carried over from the first-generation car, though the body shell underneath is significantly different. The Sebring received minor styling revisions (mostly the appearance of the nose) for the 2004 [[model year]].

===Coupe===
[[File:04-05 Chrysler Sebring coupe.jpg|thumb|left|2003–2005 Chrysler Sebring coupe]]
A redesigned Sebring Coupe was introduced for the 2001 model year, based on the third generation Mitsubishi Eclipse. Like the previous generation, the coupe shared very little in common with the sedan or the convertible, other than the name and a few exterior styling cues to help market all three vehicles together as one model.

The Sebring Coupe received a minor facelift for 2003, and was discontinued after the 2005 model-year-year. The redesigned 2008 Chrysler Sebring convertible was considered the replacement for the Sebring coupe.

===European versions===
[[File:Chrysler Sebring LX (JR) – Frontansicht, 12. Juli 2014, Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler Sebring 2.7 LX sedan (European model)]]
[[File:Chrysler Sebring LX (JR) – Heckansicht, 12. Juli 2014, Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler Sebring 2.7 LX sedan (European model)]]

Chrysler also manufactured export versions of the 2001-2006 Sebring sedan and convertible for the mainland European market. Front and rear lights are to European standards, different from the USA &amp; Canada in that turn-signal indicators are orange, with additional side-turn repeaters on the front fenders. The rear bumper has a larger recess for the longer European-size license plates, and two rear fog-lamps are fitted; one on each side of the license plate. The LHD headlamps incorporate Euro-type H4 bulbs, together with three-way up and down beam-level adjustment via a dash-mounted switch to the left of the steering wheel. Emissions controls are to the EURO 3 standard; later versions are compliant with EURO 4. Engine ranges offered were the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L DOHC 16V inline 4-cylinder (later replaced by the 2.4L unit in some countries), and the 2.7&amp;nbsp;L DOHC 24V 6-cylinder unit. The 2.0 and 2.4L engines are available with the 5-speed manual or four-speed 41TE auto transmission (depending on country); the six-cylinder engine is automatic only.

The Canadian-market 240&amp;nbsp;km/h-160&amp;nbsp;mph speedometer (with km/h predominant) is fitted to the European models. Odometer and tripmeter are in kilometres. As the 2001-2006 Sebring sedan and convertible were made in left-hand drive only, they were not sold in the UK and Ireland. Chrysler UK did however, import 50 convertibles with the 2.7L engine in 2001/2002, and these were sold though selected dealers. Being non-standard in Chrysler's UK range at the time though, no more were imported.

Trim levels offered in Europe were LE (equivalent to North American market LX) and LX (equivalent to North American market LXi). From 2004, ''Touring'' and ''Limited'' versions started to replace the LE and LX designations respectively.

Lack of a diesel engine and right-hand drive availability prevented this Sebring from being a true pan-European model unlike other Chryslers such as the PT Cruiser and Voyager. In addition, the model was dropped from Chrysler's lineup in some countries, notably France, before production ended in 2006. In France, the three domestic car-makers PSA-Peugeot, Citroen and Renault dominate the new car market, which meant very low sales of the Sebring there. As a result, the sedan was only imported by Chrysler France in 2001 and 2002. The 2003 and facelifted 2004–2006 year models were not. The convertible was only sold until 2004. The 2005 and 2006 models were likewise not imported.

Despite not being available in the UK and Ireland, some Sebring convertibles have been bought in from the U.S. as grey-imports. Some Euro-spec models have also been privately imported, mostly from Germany. The European versions are easier to re-register in the UK as they have EU-type approval. The dual km/h-mph speedo-display and twin rear foglights mean only headlamp beam-aim adjustment for left-hand traffic is necessary. The sedan is much rarer in the UK though; a few EU models have been imported, but most are likely to be North American 'grey-imports'.

In 2006, the license, tooling and assembly line for the second-generation Chrysler Sebring/Dodge Stratus sedan was sold to Russian firm [[GAZ]] for about [[USD|US$]]151 million (€ 124 million). After some minor modifications the vehicle was renamed the [[Volga Siber]]. It went into production in March 2008 at the [[Gorky Automobile Plant]] in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:В названии новой модели "ГАЗа" сохранится слово "Волга" |language=Russian |publisher=[[Lenta.Ru|auto.lenta.ru]] |date=2008-05-15 |url=http://auto.lenta.ru/news/2008/05/15/volga |accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the [[Great Recession]] sales were not as expected and production ended in 2010 after 9,000 examples were built.

The Sebring was replaced with a new model based on the [[Mitsubishi GS platform|JS platform]] for the 2007 model year. The third-generation Sebring was assembled in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]], containing over 82% of parts sourced in North America.

Because no 2007 convertible was offered, the 2006 Sebring convertible was left to fill the void, remaining in showrooms and on the company's website until the 2008 model's release.

[[File:07-Chrysler-Sebring-sedan-rear.jpg|thumb|left|2007 Chrysler Sebring sedan]]

The third-generation Sebring borrowed many styling cues from the 2003 [[Chrysler Airflite]] [[concept car|concept]]. It also has several Chrysler-signature styling cues, several of which were borrowed from the [[Chrysler Crossfire]]. The Sebring sedan and convertible were also sold in right-hand drive through Chrysler's UK and Ireland dealer network.

In 2008, the optional ''MyGIG Multimedia Infotainment System'' became available. In addition, the Limited got the 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine and was priced at the same level as the 2008 Touring model. Also for 2009, the Sebring got rear badge placements modified slightly. For model year 2010, the hood was redesigned, eliminating the longitudinal grooves.

The IIHS gave the 2010 Models a G for good in the frontal crash test, the side impact test, and the roof strength test, giving the 2010 Sebring a ''Top Safety Pick''.

===Convertible===
[[File:Chrysler Sebring convertible (third generation - JS) top down white 2of3.jpg|thumb|left|2008-2010 Chrysler Sebring]]

For the 2008 model year, the Sebring convertible was redesigned with hood strakes recalling the [[Chrysler Crossfire]]. The new convertible body style debuted at the 2007 [[Los Angeles International Auto Show]] as an early-2008 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061129/FREE/61127022/1064/cara_submit|title=Threefold Drop-Top|work=AutoWeek |accessdate=November 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the bestselling four-place open-top cars in the United States, trailing only the Ford Mustang convertible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2008-chrysler-sebring-sebring-convertible-review |title=2008 Chrysler Sebring / Sebring Convertible What’s new, trim levels, optional equipment, and safety info for the 2008 Chrysler Sebring |date=May 2008 |publisher=Car and Driver |accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new convertible offered both a [[retractable hardtop]] and soft tops, with the Sebring's roofs manufactured by [[Karmann]]. A vinyl top came on the base LX model, a cloth roof on the Touring and Limited models with the option of a retractable metal hardtop. The convertible top retracts into the trunk with a power [[Convertible#Tonneau covers|tonneau cover]] and a luggage protector for the top. The top can also be retracted with the remote keyless entry, meaning the top can be stowed without being inside the car or starting the engine.

The LX model included a new 2.4 L I4 engine, the Touring version came with a retuned version of the 2.7 L V6, while the Limited featured a new 3.5 L V6. Unlike the Sebring sedan, the convertible was not available in [[all-wheel drive]].

===Chinese versions===
[[File:Chrysler Sebring JS China 2016-04-08.jpg|left|thumb|Chrysler Sebring JS]]
Production of the Chrysler Sebring sedan for the China market began in 2007 at the  Beijing-Benz DaimlerChrysler Automotive Co. (BBDC) in Beijing. BBDC is a joint venture between the [[Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Corporation|Beijing Automotive Industry Holding]] and Chrysler.

Production of the Sebring leveraged assembly capacity for the new BBDC plant which also built the Chrysler 300C, the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class]] and Mitsubishi Outlander.
Four-cylinder World Engines for the Sebring were built at the [[Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance]] (GEMA) plant in Dundee, Michigan for export to China. GEMA began as a joint venture of Chrysler, [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]], and [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]]. Since 2009, GEMA is wholly owned by Chrysler.

===European version===
Chrysler introduced this generation Sebring to Europe (including right-hand drive markets) as their first competitor in the [[D-segment]].  It received a generally unfavorable reception from European motoring journalists.

===Mid-cycle refresh and replacement===
{{main|Chrysler 200#First generation (2011–2014)}}
The Chrysler Sebring was extensively refreshed in 2010, but was [[badge engineering|rebadged]] as the [[Chrysler 200]]. The [[Mitsubishi GS platform|JS platform]] and bodyshell had been retained, but there were extensive cosmetic and powertrain changes to the vehicle. The name change helped distance the vehicle from the Sebring's reputation for quality issues and fleet pervasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/autos/1111/gallery.chrysler_fiat_success.fortune/4.html |title=How Chrysler keeps killing it - Chrysler 200 (4) |publisher=Money.cnn |date=10 November 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111112185012/http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/autos/1111/gallery.chrysler_fiat_success.fortune/4.html |archivedate=12 November 2011 |accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Colocasia esculenta''''' is a tropical plant grown primarily for its edible [[corm]]s, the [[root vegetable]]s most commonly known as '''''taro''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɑː|r|oʊ|,_|ˈ|t|æ|r|oʊ}}). It is the most widely cultivated species of several plants in the [[Araceae]] family which are used as vegetables for their [[corm]]s, leaves, and [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]. Taro corms are a food staple in [[Culture of Africa|African]], [[Oceania|Oceanic]] and [[South Asia|South Asian]] cultures, and taro is believed to have been one of the earliest cultivated plants.

{{TOC limit|4}}

== Names and Etymology ==
This plant and its root is generally called taro, but it has different names in different countries like for instance [[eddoe]], or {{linktext|malanga}}. The plant is called ''tales'' in [[Java|Java,]] ''taro'' in [[Tahiti]], ''ndalo'' in [[Fiji]], ''talo'' in [[Samoa]], ''colcas'' ({{linktext|قلقاس|lang=ar}}) in [[Arabic]], ''kolokasi'' or ''kolokas'' in [[Cyprus]], ''kalo'' in [[Hawaii]] and ''amateke'' in [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2009-12-394/GHOSH-DASTIDAR-MASTERS-REPORT.pdf?sequence=2|title=COLOCASIA ESCULENTA: AN ACCOUNT OF ITS ETHNOBOTANY AND POTENTIALS|last1=Dastidar|first1=Sayantani Ghosh|date=December 2009|publisher=The [[University of Texas at Austin]]|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} Taro is often referred to as "elephant ears" when grown as an [[ornamental plant]].

== Taxonomy and Ecology ==

=== Nomenclature and related plants ===
[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] originally described two species, ''Colocasia esculenta'' and ''[[Colocasia antiquorum]]'' but many later botanists consider them both to be members of a single, very variable species, the correct name for which is ''Colocasia esculenta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Albert F. Hill|title=The Nomenclature of the Taro and its Varieties|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/31894#page/134/mode/1up|journal=Botanical Museum Leaflets, Harvard University|volume=7|issue=7|pages=113–118|year=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GRIN|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[botanical name|specific epithet]], ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:esculentus|esculenta]]}}'', means "edible" in Latin.

Taro is related to ''[[Xanthosoma]]'' and ''[[Caladium]]'', plants commonly grown [[ornamental plant|ornamentally]], and like them it is sometimes loosely called elephant ear. Similar taro varieties include giant taro (''[[Alocasia macrorrhizos]]''), swamp taro (''[[Cyrtosperma merkusii]]''), and arrowleaf elephant's ear (''[[Xanthosoma sagittifolium]]'').

===Description===
''Colocasia esculenta'' is a [[perennial plant|perennial]], tropical plant primarily grown as a [[root vegetable]] for its edible, starchy [[corm]]. The plant has [[rhizome]]s of different shapes and sizes. Leaves are up to {{cvt|40|×|24.8|cm|in}} and sprout from the rhizome. They are dark green above and light green beneath. They are triangular-ovate, sub-rounded and mucronate at the apex, with the tip of the basal lobes rounded or sub-rounded. The [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] is {{cvt|0.8|-|1.2|m|ft}} high. The path can be up to {{cvt|25|cm}} long. The [[Spadix (botany)|spadix]] is about three fifths as long as the [[spathe]], with flowering parts up to {{cvt|8|mm}} in diameter. The female portion is at the fertile ovaries intermixed with sterile white ones. Neuters grow above the females, and are rhomboid or irregular orium lobed, with six or eight cells. The appendage is shorter than the male portion.&lt;gallery&gt;

=== Distribution and habitat ===
''Colocasia esculenta'' is thought to be native to [[Southern India]] and [[Southeast Asia]], but is widely [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolchaar, K. 2006 Economic Botany in the Tropics, Macmillan India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRIN"&gt;{{GRIN|''Colocasia esculenta''|11177|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Colocasia'' is thought to have originated in the [[Indomalaya ecozone]], perhaps in [[East India]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bangladesh]]. It spread by cultivation eastward into [[Southeast Asia]], [[East Asia]] and the [[Pacific Islands]]; westward to [[Egypt]] and the eastern [[Mediterranean Basin]]; and then southward and westward from there into [[East Africa]] and [[West Africa]], where it spread to the [[Caribbean]] and [[Americas]]. 

Taro was probably first native to the lowland [[wetland]]s of [[Malaysia]], where it is called ''taloes''.

In Australia, [[Colocasia esculenta var. aquatilis|''Colocasia esculenta'' var. ''aquatilis'']] is native to the [[Kimberley region]] of [[Western Australia]]; variety ''esculenta'' is naturalised in Western Australia, the [[Northern Territory]], [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]].

In Turkey, ''Colocasia esculenta'' is locally known as ''gölevez'' and mainly grown on the Mediterranean coast, such as the [[Alanya]] and [[Anamur]] districts of [[Antalya]].

In the [[Southeastern United States|southeastern US]], this plant is recognized as an [[invasive species]].&lt;ref name="Georgia Invasive Species"&gt;{{cite web|title=Invasive Plants to Watch for in Georgia|url=http://bugwoodcloud.org/mura/gist/assets/File/handbook/EDRRplants.pdf|website=Georgia Invasive Species Task Force|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texasinvasives.org/plant_database/detail.php?symbol=COES Colocasia esculenta]. Texasinvasives.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantatlas.usf.edu/flip/plant.aspx?id=19 Colocasia esculenta], Florida Invasive Plants&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/node/108 Colocasia esculenta], University of Florida&lt;/ref&gt; Many populations can be commonly found growing near drain ditches and [[bayous]] in [[Houston]], Texas.

== Cultivation ==
[[File:Taro fields.JPG|thumb|One of the largest taro growing areas in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] is on Kauaʻi, in the [[Hanalei, Hawaii|Lower Hanalei Valley]]]]
[[File:Tarooutput.png|thumb|Geographic distribution of taro production]]
[[File:Taro2009.png|thumb|Taro output in 2009]]
Taro is believed to have been one of the earliest cultivated plants.&lt;ref name="new-agri.co"&gt;Country profile: Samoa, New Agriculturist Online [http://www.new-agri.co.uk/06-1/countryp.html new-agri.co], accessed June 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates are that taro was in cultivation in wet tropical [[India]] before 5000 BC, presumably coming from Malaysia, and from India further transported westward to ancient [[Egypt]], where it was described by [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historians as an important crop.

At around 3.3 million metric tons per year, [[Nigeria]] is the largest producer of taro in the world.

Taro can be grown in [[Paddy field|paddy fields]] where water is abundant or in upland situations where water is supplied by rainfall or supplemental irrigation. Taro is one of the few crops (along with [[rice]] and [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]]) that can be grown under flooded conditions. This is due to air spaces in the [[petiole (botany)|petiole]], which permit underwater gaseous exchange with the atmosphere. For a maximum dissolved [[oxygen]] supply, the water should be cool and flowing. Warm, stagnant water causes basal rotting. For maximum yields, the water level should be controlled so that the base of the plant is always under water.

Flooded cultivation has some advantages over dry-land cultivation: higher yields (about double), out-of-season production (which may result in higher prices), and weed control (which flooding facilitates). On the other hand, in flooded production systems taro requires a longer maturation period, investment in infrastructure, and higher operational costs, and [[monoculture]] is likely.

Like most [[List of root vegetables|root crops]], taro and [[eddoe]]s do well in deep, moist or even swampy soils where the annual rainfall exceeds {{cvt|2,500|mm}}. Eddoes are more resistant to drought and cold. The crop attains maturity within six to twelve months after planting in dry-land cultivation and after twelve to fifteen months in wetland cultivation. The crop is harvested when the plant height decreases and the leaves turn yellow. These signals are usually less distinct in flooded taro cultivation.

Harvesting is usually done by hand tools, even in mechanized production systems. First, the soil around the corm is loosened, and then, the corm is pulled up by grabbing the base of the petioles. The global average yield is 6.2 tonnes/hectare but varies according to the region. In Asia, average yields reach 12.6 tonnes/hectare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tistr.or.th/rap/publication/1999/1999_16_high.pdf FAO: Taro cultivation in Asia and the Pacific, 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807122927/http://www.tistr.or.th/rap/publication/1999/1999_16_high.pdf |date=2011-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People usually consume its edible corm and leaves. The corms, which have a light purple color due to [[phenol]]ic pigments,&lt;ref&gt;McGee, Harold. On Food and cooking. 2004. Scribner, {{ISBN|978-0-684-80001-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; are roasted, baked or boiled. The natural sugars give a sweet, nutty flavor. The starch is easily digestible, and since the grains are fine and small it is often used for baby food. Young taro leaves and stems can be eaten after boiling twice to remove the acrid flavor. The leaves are a good source of [[Vitamin A|vitamins A]] and [[Vitamin C|C]] and contain more [[protein]] than the corms.

In its raw form, the plant is toxic due to the presence of [[calcium oxalate]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weird-food.com/weird-food-vegetable.html Weird Foods from around the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411160105/http://www.weird-food.com/weird-food-vegetable.html|date=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pro_apcc_toxic_tarovine|title=ASPCA|website=ASPCA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the presence of needle-shaped [[raphide]]s in the plant cells.

====Oceania====

=====Cook Islands=====
Taro is the pre-eminent crop of the [[Cook Islands]] and surpasses all other crops in terms of land area devoted to production. The prominence of the crop there has led it to be a staple of the population′s diet. Taro is grown across the country, but the method of cultivation depends on the nature of the island it is grown on. Taro also plays an important role in the country's export trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac450e/ac450e08.htm|title=Taro Cultivation in Asia and the Pacific|last1=FAO|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root is eaten boiled, as is standard across [[Polynesia]]. Taro leaves are also eaten as a delicacy, cooked with coconut milk, onion, and meat or fish.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=====Fiji=====
[[File:Lovo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fijian lovo]] of cooked staples: taro and [[cassava]] (white)]]
Taro (''dalo'' in [[Fijian language|Fijian]]) has been a staple of the Fijian diet for centuries, and its cultural importance is celebrated on [[Taro Day]]. Its growth as an export crop began in 1993 when [[taro leaf blight]]&lt;ref name="TaroLeafBlight"&gt;[http://www2.ctahr.hawaii.edu/adap2/ascc_landgrant/Dr_Brooks/ColorPlates.pdf Taro leaf blight caused by ''Phytophthora colocasiae''], College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR), [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawai'i at Mānoa]], Honolulu, Hawai'i, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; decimated the taro industry in neighboring [[Samoa]]. Fiji filled the void and was soon supplying taro internationally. Almost 80% of Fiji's exported taro comes from the island of [[Taveuni]] where the taro beetle species ''Papuana uninodis'' is absent. The Fijian taro industry on the main islands of [[Viti Levu]] and [[Vanua Levu]] faces constant damage from the beetles. The Fiji Ministry of Agriculture and the Land Resources Division of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) are researching pest control and instigating quarantine restrictions to prevent the spread of the pest. Taveuni now exports pest damage-free crops.

=====Hawaii=====
''Kalo'' is the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] name for the Taro plant. The local crop plays an important role in Hawaiian culture, [[Hawaiian religion|mythology]], and cuisine. Kalo is a traditional [[staple food|staple]] of the [[native cuisine of Hawaii]]. Some of the uses for taro include [[poi (food)|poi]], table taro (steamed and served like a potato), taro chips, and [[luau]] leaf (to make [[laulau]])). In Hawaii, kalo is farmed under either dryland or wetland conditions. Taro farming in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] is challenging because of the difficulties of accessing fresh water. Kalo is usually grown in "pond fields" known as ''loʻi''. Typical dryland or "upland" varieties (varieties grown in watered but not flooded fields) in Hawaii are ''lehua maoli'' and ''bun long'', the latter widely known as "Chinese taro". ''Bun long'' is used for making taro chips. ''Dasheen'' (also called "eddo") is another dryland variety of ''C. esculenta'' grown for its edible corms or as an ornamental plant. A contemporary Hawaiian diet consists of many tuberous plants, particularly [[sweet potato]] and kalo.

The Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service determined the 10-year median production of kalo in Hawaii to be about 6.1 million pounds (2,800 t).&lt;ref name="Viotti"&gt;Viotti, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, 2003 taro production in Hawaii was only 5 million pounds (2,300 t), an all-time low since record-keeping began in 1946. The previous low of 1997 was 5.5 million pounds (2,500 t). Despite generally growing demand, production was even lower in 2005—only 4 million pounds, with ''kalo'' for processing into ''poi'' accounting for 97.5%.&lt;ref name="Hao"&gt;Hao, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Urbanization is one cause driving down harvests from the high of 14.1 million pounds (6,400 t) in 1948, but more recently, the decline has resulted from pests and diseases. A non-native [[Ampullariidae|apple snail]] (''Pomacea canaliculata'') is a major culprit along with a plant rot disease traced to a newly identified species of [[fungus]] in the genus ''[[Phytophthora]]'' that now affects kalo crops throughout Hawaii. Although [[pesticides]] could control both problems to some extent, pesticide use in the ''loʻi'' is banned because of the opportunity for chemicals to migrate quickly into streams, and then eventually the sea.&lt;ref name="Viotti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hao" /&gt;

; Social Roles
[[File:Cleaning the kalo, Sandwich Islands, 1852, watercolour by James Gay Sawkins.jpg|thumb|Cleaning the ''kalo'', Sandwich Islands, 1852, watercolour by James Gay Sawkins]]
Important aspects of [[Hawaiian culture]] revolve around ''kalo'' cultivation and consumption. For example, the newer name for a traditional Hawaiian feast ([[luau]]) comes from the ''kalo''. Young ''kalo'' tops baked with [[coconut milk]] and chicken meat or [[octopus]] arms are frequently served at ''luaus''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

By ancient Hawaiian custom, fighting is not allowed when a bowl of ''poi'' is "open". Similarly, it is also considered disrespectful to fight in front of an elder and one should not raise their voice, speak angrily, or make rude comments/gestures.

;''Loʻi''
[[File:Kalo Loi Harvest.jpg|thumb|left|Several small ''loʻi'' (pondfields) in which ''kalo'' (taro) is being grown in the [[Maunawili, Hawaii|Maunawili Valley]] on [[Oahu|Oʻahu]], Hawaiʻi. The ditch on the left in the picture is called an ''ʻauwai'' and supplies diverted stream water to the ''loʻi''.]]
A ''loʻi'' is a patch of wetland dedicated to growing ''kalo'' (taro).  Hawaiians have traditionally used water [[irrigation]] systems to produce kalo. Wetland fields produce ten to fifteen times more kalo per acre than dry fields.&lt;ref&gt;Lilikala Kameʻeleihiwa, ''Hawaii: Center of the Pacific'' (Acton, MA: Copley Custom Textbooks, 2008), 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wetland-grown kalo need a constant flow of water, and to get this water, fields are usually positioned between the ''mauka'' (mountains) and ''makai'' (sea). A ''lo'i'' specifically denotes wetland kalo growing, not dry land.

The ''loʻi'' is part of an ''ahupuaʻa'', a division of land from the mountain to the sea. Ahupuaʻa means "pig altar," and was named for stone altars with pig head carvings that marked the boundaries of each Hawaiian land division. Ideally, an ahupuaʻa has all the necessities within its borders. From the mountains, materials such as wood are provided for thatching roofs and twining rope. The uplands produce crops like sugar cane and sweet potatoes, while the lowlands provide taro and fish. This system typically satisfies the large populations in each ''ahupuaʻa''.&lt;ref&gt;Lilikala Kameʻeleihiwa, ''Hawaii: Center of the Pacific'' (Acton, MA: Copley Custom Textbooks, 2008), 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

When kalo was brought to Hawaiʻi, there were about 300 varieties (about 100 remain). The kalo plant takes seven months to grow until harvest, so ''lo`i'' fields are used in rotation and the soil can be replenished while the ''loʻi'' in use has sufficient water. The stems are typically replanted in the ''lo`i'' for future kalo harvests. Once harvested, kalo is incorporated into many foods. The leaves are used to make [[laulau]], from the corm poi or ''paʻiʻai''.

; History

One mythological version of Hawaiian ancestry cites the taro plant as an ancestor to Hawaiians. Legend joins the two siblings of high and divine rank: [[Papahānaumoku]] ("Papa from whom lands are born", or Earth mother) and [[Wākea]] (Sky father). Together they create the islands of Hawaii and a beautiful woman, Hoʻohokukalani (The Heavenly one who made the stars).&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Martha Warren. "Papa and Wakea." ''Hawaiian Mythology''. (Honolulu: University of Hawaii, 1976). 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of kalo begins when Wakea and Papa conceived their daughter, Hoʻohokukalani. Daughter and father then conceived a child together named Hāloanakalaukapalili (Long stalk trembling), but it was [[stillborn]]. After the father and daughter buried the child near their house, a kalo plant grew over the grave:&lt;ref&gt;"A Brief History of Taro in Hawai`i ." Hawaiian kalo. Bishop Museum, n.d. Web. 18 Apr.2013. &lt;http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/botany/taro/key/HawaiianKalo/Media/Html/history.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The stems were slender and when the wind blew they swayed and bent as though paying homage, their heart-shaped leaves shivering gracefully as in hula.  And in the center of each leaf water gathered, like a mother’s teardrop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lomilomi-massage.org/Haloa.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804111903/http://www.lomilomi-massage.org/Haloa.html |archivedate=2012-08-04 |df= }}, Heard, Barbara H.

The second child born of Wakea and Hoʻohokukalani was named Hāloa after his older brother. The kalo of the earth was the sustenance for the young brother and became the principal food for successive generations.  Now, as man continues to work the wetlands for this sacred crop, he remembers Haloanaka, the ancestor that nourishes him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiiseed.org/issues/taro/taro-creation-story|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425154750/http://www.hawaiiseed.org/issues/taro/taro-creation-story|archivedate=2012-04-25|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-02-07|df=}}, "Taro Creation Story ?

===== Papua New Guinea =====
The Taro corm is a traditional [[staple food|staple]] crop for large parts of Papua New Guinea, with a domestic trade extending its consumption to areas where it is not traditionally grown. Taro from some regions has developed particularly good reputations with (for instance) Lae taro being highly prized.

Among the [[Urapmin people]] of Papua New Guinea, taro (known in [[Urap language|Urap]] as ''ima'') is the main source of sustenance along with the [[sweet potato]] (Urap: ''wan''). In fact, the word for "food" in Urap is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of these two words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Joel|year=1995|title=Dispossessing the Spirits: Christian Transformations of Desire and Ecology among the Urapmin of Papua New Guinea quick view|journal=Ethnology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=212–213|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Polynesia =====
Considered the staple starch of traditional [[Polynesia]]n cuisine, taro is both a common and prestigious food item that was first introduced to the Polynesian islands by prehistoric seafarers of Southeast Asian derivation. The tuber itself is prepared in various ways, including baking, steaming in [[earth oven]]s (''umu'' or ''imu''), boiling, and frying. The famous Hawaiian staple [[poi (food)|poi]] is made by mashing steamed taro roots with water. Taro also features in traditional desserts such as Samoan ''fa'ausi'', which consists of grated, cooked taro mixed with coconut milk and brown sugar. The leaves of the taro plant also feature prominently in Polynesian cooking, especially as edible wrappings for dishes such as Hawaiian ''[[laulau]]'', Fijian and Samoan ''palusami'' (wrapped around onions and coconut milk), and Tongan ''lupulu'' (wrapped corned beef). Ceremonial presentations on occasion of chiefly rites or communal events (weddings, funerals, etc.) traditionally included the ritual presentation of raw and cooked taro roots/plants.

The Hawaiian ''laulau'' traditionally contains pork, fish, and ''lu'au'' (cooked taro leaf). The wrapping is inedible ''ti'' leaves (Hawaiian: ''lau ki'').  Cooked taro leaf has the consistency of cooked spinach and is therefore unsuitable for use as a wrapping.

===== Samoa =====
[[File:Pig on the Samoan Umu.jpg|thumb|Taro corms cooked with pig on the Samoan [[Earth oven|umu]]]]
In Samoa, the baby talo leaves and coconut milk are wrapped into parcels and cooked, along with other food, in an earth oven . The parcels are called ''palusami'' or ''lu'au''. The resulting taste is smoky, sweet, savory and has a unique creamy texture. The root is also baked (''Talo tao'') in the [[Earth oven|''umu'']] or boiled with coconut cream (''Faálifu Talo''). It has a slightly bland and starchy flavor. It is sometimes called the Polynesian potato.

===== Tonga =====
''Lū'' is lea faka-Tonga for the edible leaves of the talo/taro plant, as well as the traditional dish made using them. This meal is still prepared for special occasions and especially on ''Sāpate'' (Sunday). The dish consists of chopped meat and onions with coconut milk wrapped in a number of ''lū talo''/taro leaves. This is then wrapped traditionally in a ''lū siaine''/banana leaf (nowadays, aluminum foil is often used) and put in the ''ʻumu'' to cook. It has a number of named varieties, dependent on the filling:

*''Lū pulu'' – ''lū'' with beef, commonly using imported ''kapapulu'' ([[corned beef]])
*''Lū sipi'' –  ''lū'' with lamb
*''Lū moa'' – ''lū'' with chicken
*''Lū hoosi'' – ''lū'' with horse meat

====East and Southeast Asia====

=====China=====
Taro ({{zh|t=芋頭|s=芋头|p=yùtou|cy=wuhtáu}}), is commonly used as a main course as steamed taro with or without [[sugar]], as a substitute for other [[cereal]]s, in [[Chinese cuisine]] in a variety of styles and provinces steamed, boiled or stir-fried as a main dish and as a flavor-enhancing ingredient. In Northern China, it is often boiled or steamed then peeled and eaten with or without sugar much like a potato. It is commonly braised with [[pork]] or [[beef]]. It is used in the [[dim sum]] cuisine of southern China to make a small plated dish called [[taro dumpling]] as well as a pan-fried dish called [[taro cake]]. It can also be shredded into long strips which are woven together to form a [[seafood birdsnest]].

Taro cake is a delicacy traditionally eaten during [[Chinese New Year]] celebrations. As a dessert, it can be mashed into a [[Taro purée|purée]] or used as a flavoring in ''[[tong sui]]'', [[bubble tea]], [[ice cream]], and other desserts such as Sweet Taro Pie. McDonald's sells taro-flavored [[pie]]s in China.

Taro is mashed in the dessert known as [[taro purée]].

=====Japan=====
[[File:Excavated satoimo (1)-(5).jpg|thumb|Excavated Japanese ''satoimo'' root (stems are cut before the plant is dug up): (1) Remaining stem from parent or seed satoimo, (2) Parent or seed satoimo, (3) Remaining stem from child satoimo, (4) Child satoimo, (5) Grandchild satoimo]]
A similar plant in Japan is called {{nihongo||里芋、[[:ja:サトイモ|サトイモ]]|satoimo|literally "village potato"}}. The "child" and "grandchild" corms (cormels, cormlets) which bud from the parent ''satoimo'', are called {{nihongo||子芋|koimo}} and {{nihongo||孫芋|magoimo}}, respectively, or more generally {{nihongo||芋の子|imonoko}}. ''Satoimo'' has been propagated in [[Southeast Asia]] since the late [[Jōmon period]].  It was a regional staple before [[rice]] became predominant. The tuber, ''satoimo'', is often prepared through simmering in fish stock (''[[dashi]]'') and soy sauce.  The stalk, {{ill|zuiki|lt=''zuiki''|ja|芋茎}}, can also be prepared a number of ways, depending on the variety.&lt;ref&gt;The Japan Times Online&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Korea=====
[[File:Toran-guk.jpg|thumb|left|''Toran-[[guk]]'' (taro soup)]]
In Korea, taro is called ''toran'' ({{lang-ko|토란}}: "earth egg"), and the corm is stewed and the leaf stem is stir-fried. Taro roots can be used for medicinal purposes, particularly for treating insect bites. It is made into the Korean traditional soup ''toranguk'' (토란국). Taro stems are often used as an ingredient in [[yukgaejang]] (육개장).

=====Philippines=====
[[File:Laingjf1762.JPG|thumb|Laing]]
In the [[Philippines]] taro is usually called ''gabi'', ''abi'' or ''avi'' and is widely available throughout the archipelago. Its adaptability to marshland and swamps make it one of the most common vegetables in the Philippines. The leaves, stems, and corms are all consumed and form part of the local cuisine. A popular recipe for taro is ''laing''; the dish's main ingredients are taro leaves (at times including stems) cooked in coconut milk, and salted with fermented shrimp or fish ''[[bagoong]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/dpinpin/2303024507/in/set-72157604019353752/|title=Laing, gabi|work=Flickr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes heavily spiced with red hot chilies called ''[[siling labuyo]]''. Another dish in which taro is commonly used is the Philippine national stew, ''[[sinigang]]'', although radish can be used if taro is not available. This stew is made with pork and beef, shrimp, or fish, a souring agent (tamarind fruit, [[Averrhoa bilimbi|''kamias'']], etc.) with the addition of peeled and diced corms as thickener. The corm is also prepared as a basic ingredient for ''[[ginataan]]'', a coconut milk and taro dessert.

=====Taiwan=====
[[File:芋泥 à Taipei.jpg|thumb|left|Small ball of mashed taro paste served on a banana leaf in a restaurant of the Daan district (Taipei)]]
In [[Taiwan]], taro— ''yùtóu'' ({{lang|zh|芋頭}}) in Mandarin, and ''ō͘-á'' ({{lang|zh|芋仔}}) in [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]]—is well-adapted to Taiwanese climate and can grow almost anywhere with minimal maintenance. Before the [[Taiwan Miracle]] made rice affordable to everyone, taro was one of the main staples in Taiwan. Nowadays taro is used more often in desserts. [[supermarket]] varieties range from about the size and shape of a [[brussels sprout]] to longer, larger varieties the size of a [[football]]. Taro chips are often used as a potato-chip-like snack. Compared to [[potato chips]], taro chips are harder and have a [[nut (fruit)|nuttier]] flavor. Another popular traditional Taiwanese snack is [[taro ball]], served on ice or deep-fried.

=====Thailand=====
In [[Thai cuisine]], taro {{lang-th|เผือก}} (''pheuak'') is used in a variety of ways depending on the region. Boiled taro is readily available in the market packaged in small cellophane bags, already peeled and diced, and eaten as a snack. Pieces of boiled taro with coconut milk are a traditional Thai dessert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaifoodplus.com/Thai/Recipes/Dessert/Taro_in_Coconut_Milk.php|title=Real Estate Guide Plano – Hottest Deals On Market|work=Real Estate Guide Plano|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913015658/http://www.thaifoodplus.com/Thai/Recipes/Dessert/Taro_in_Coconut_Milk.php|archivedate=2011-09-13|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raw taro is also often sliced and deep fried and sold in bags as chips (เผือกทอด). As in other Asian countries, taro is a popular flavor for ice cream in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/186266134560600956/|title=How to Make Coconut and Taro Ice Cream – A Thai Classic Dessert|date=18 March 2013|work=Pinterest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Vietnam=====
[[File:Seaweed taro dessert.jpg|thumb|[[Chè]] khoai môn]]
In Vietnam, there is a large variety of taro plants. One is called ''khoai môn,'' which is used as a filling in [[spring roll]]s, cakes, puddings and [[Chè|sweet soup desserts]], smoothies and other desserts. Taro is used in the [[Tết]] dessert ''chè khoai môn'', which is sticky rice pudding with taro roots. The stems are also used in soups such as ''[[canh chua]]''. One is called ''khoai sọ'', which is smaller in size and more delicious than ''Khoai môn'', and of course, more expensive than ''khoai môn''. Another common taro plant grows roots in shallow waters and grows stems and leaves above the surface of the water. This taro plant has [[saponin]]-like substances that cause a hot, itchy feeling in the mouth and throat. Northern farmers used to plant them to cook the stems and leaves to feed their hogs. They re-grew quickly from their roots. After cooking, the [[saponin]] in the soup of taro stems and leaves is reduced to a level the hogs can eat. Today this practice is no longer popular in Vietnam agriculture. These taro plants are commonly called ''khoai ngứa'', which literally means "itchy potato".

====South Asia====

=====Bangladesh=====
[[File:Food-Kochu-Bata.jpg|thumb|left|Kochu bata]]
In [[Bangladesh]] taro is a very popular vegetable known as ''kochu'' (কচু) or ''mukhi'' (মুখি). Within the [[Sylheti]] dialect of the Bangla language, it is called ''mukhi''. It is usually cooked with small [[prawn]]s or the [[ilish]] fish into a [[curry]], but some dishes are cooked with [[dried fish]]. Its green leaves, ''kochu pata'' (কচু পাতা), and stem, ''kochu'' (কচু), are also eaten as a favorite dish and usually ground to a paste or finely chopped to make ''shak'' — but it must be boiled well beforehand. Taro stolons or stems, ''kochur loti'' (কচুর লতি), are also favored by Bangladeshis and cooked with [[shrimp]], dried fish or the head of the ilish fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/lifestyle/deshi-mix/kochu-you-can-say-again-1259194|title=Kochu! (You can say that again...)|date=2016-07-26|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taro is available, either fresh or frozen, in the UK and US in most Asian stores and supermarkets specialising in [[Bangladeshi cuisine|Bangladeshi]] or [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] food. Also, another variety called ''maan kochu'' is consumed and is a rich source of vitamins and nutrients. ''Maan Kochu'' is made into a paste and fried to prepare a delicious food known as ''Kochu Bata''.

=====India=====
[[File:Saru bhoja.jpg|thumb|Saru bhoja]]
[[File:Patra (Gujarati snack).jpg|thumb|[[Patrode]]]]
In India, taro or [[eddoe]] is a common dish served in many ways. It is called ''Arvi'' in Urdu/Hindi in Central and North India, which is often mispronounced as ''Arbi''. It is called कचु(''kachu'') in Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;The Cross Name Index to Medicinal Plants, Four-Volume Set By Anthony R. Torkelson. Page Number 1694.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mizoram]], it is called ''bäl''; the leaves, stalks and tubers are eaten as ''dawl bai''. The leaves and stalks are often traditionally preserved to be eaten in dry season as "''dawl rëp bai''".&lt;ref name="dawlbai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.misual.com/2008/11/09/ei-leh-in-lam-bawk-aw/|title=Ei leh in lam bawk aw! - mi(sual).com|website=www.misual.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ndtv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/humayunpur-a-mini-north-eastern-food-hub-in-safdarjung-1724305|title=Humayunpur:  A Mini North-Eastern Food Hub In Safdarjung|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Assam]], a north-eastern state of India, taro is known as "kosu" (কচু). Various parts of different types of such plants are eaten by making different dishes. The leaf buds called "Kosu loti" (কচু লতি) are cooked with sour dried fruits called ''Thekera'' (থেকেৰা) or sometimes with Tamarind or Elephant apple alone or with a small amount of pulses and sometimes, fish. Similar dishes are prepared from the long root-like structures called ''Kosu thuri''. A fried dish with sour objects is also made from its flower (''Kosu kala''). Soupy dishes are made from solid roots which are sometimes also boiled and eaten sometimes with salt as snacks or home-made fast food.

In [[Manipur]], another north-eastern Indian state, taro is known as ''pan''. The kuki tribes called it ''bal''. Boiled ''bal'' is a snack at lunch along with chutney or hot chili-flakes besides being cooked as a main dish along with smoked or dried meat, beans, and mustard leaves. They also sun dry the leaves and keep them for future use as broth and hodge-podge. It is widely available and is eaten in many forms, either baked, boiled, or cooked into a curry with Hilsa fish or with fermented soybeans called ''Hawai-zaar''. The leaves are also used in a special traditional dish called ''utti'', cooked with peas.

In [[Himachal Pradesh]], a northern state in India, the tarp root is known as ''ghandyali'', and the plant is known as ''Kachalu'' in [[Kangra &amp; Mandi district]]. The dish called ''patrodu'' is made using taro leaves rolled with corn/gram flour and boiled in water. Another dish, ''pujji'' is made with mashed leaves and the trunk of the plant and ''ghandyali'' or taro roots are prepared as a separate dish. Also in the capital [[Shimla]], a pancake-style dish, called ''[[Patra (dish)|patra]]'' or ''patid'', is made using gram flour.

A tall-growing variety of taro is extensively used on the western coast of India to make ''[[patrode]]'', ''patrade'', or ''patrada'', literally a "leaf-pancake". In the [[Dakshin Kannada]] district in the state of [[Karnataka]], it is used as a morning breakfast dish, either made like fritters or steamed. In the state of [[Maharashtra]], the leaves, called ''alu che paana'', are de-veined, rolled with a paste of gram flour, tamarind paste, red chili powder, turmeric, coriander, [[asafoetida]], and salt, and then steamed. These can be eaten whole or cut into pieces, or shallow fried and eaten as a snack known as ''alu chi wadi''. ''Alu chya panan chi patal bhaji'' a lentil and colocasia leaves curry, is also popular. In [[Goan cuisine]] as well as the [[Konkani cuisine]] Taro leaves are very popular.

In the Indian states of [[Gujarat|Gujarat]] and [[Maharashtra]], the leaves of the plant are used to make [[Patra (dish)|''patra'']] a dish with gram flour, tamarind and other spices.

Sindhis call it ''kachaloo''; they fry it, compress it, and re-fry it to make a dish called ''tuk'' which complements [[Sindhi cuisine|Sindhi curry]].

In [[Kerala]], a state in southern [[India]], taro corms are known as ചേമ്പ് കിഴങ്ങ് ''chembu-kizhangu''. Taro is used as a [[staple food]], as a side dish, or as an ingredient in various side dishes like [[Sambar (dish)|''sambar'']]. As a staple food, it is steamed and eaten with a spicy [[chutney]] of green chilies, tamarind, and shallots. The leaves and stems of certain varieties of taro are used as a vegetable in Kerala.

In other Indian states, [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]], taro corms are known as ''sivapan-kizhangu'' (''seppankilangu'' or ''cheppankilangu''), ''chamagadda'', or in coastal Andhra districts as ''chaama dumpa'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. It can be cooked in many ways, such as deep-fried in oil for a side item with rice, or cooked in a tangy tamarind sauce with spices, onion, and tomato.

In the East Indian state of [[West Bengal]], taro roots are thinly sliced and fried to make chips called ''kochu bhaja''. The stem is used to cook a very tasty ''Kochur saag'' with fried hilsha fish head or boiled chhola (chickpea), often eaten as a starter with hot rice. The roots are also made into a paste with spices and eaten with rice. The most popular dish is a spicy [[curry]] made with prawn and taro roots.

In the [[Mithilanchal]] region of [[Bihar]], taro root is known as  अडुआ and its leaves are called अड़िकंच के पात.  A curry of taro leaves is made with mustard paste and आमिल (sun-dried mango pulp used for a sour taste in daal, curry and sour gravy).

In the eastern Indian state of [[Odisha]], taro root is known as ''saru''. Dishes made of taro include ''saru besara'' (taro in mustard and garlic paste). It is also an indispensable ingredient in preparing the heart of [[Odia people|Odia]] cuisine, the ''dalma'', where vegetables are cooked with [[dal]]. Sliced taro roots, deep fried in oil and mixed with red chili powder and salt, are known as ''saru chips''.

In the north Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]] and neighboring [[Nepal]], taro is considered a healthy food cooked in a variety of ways. The delicate''Gaderi'' taro of Kumaun, especially from the Lobanj region is much sought after. Most commonly it is boiled in tamarind water until tender, then it is diced into cubes which are stir-fried in mustard oil with methi (fenugreek) leaves. Boiling it in salty water in iron cooking pots until it becomes like porridge, is another technique. The young leaves called ''gaaba'', are steamed, then sun-dried and stored for later use. For another use, the taro leaves and stems are used raw as an ingredient for pickles. Crushed leaves and stems are mixed with de-husked urad dal – black lentils&lt;!--black lentils or urad dal?--&gt; and then dried as small balls called ''badi''. The stems may also be sun-dried and stored for later use. On one special day, women worship ''saptarshi'' ("seven sages") and eat only rice with taro leaf vegetable.

=====Maldives=====
''Ala'' was widely grown in the southern atolls of [[Addu Atoll]], [[Fuvahmulah]], [[Huvadhu Atoll]], and [[Laamu Atoll]] and is considered a [[staple food|staple]] even after rice was introduced. ''Ala'' and ''olhu ala'' are still widely eaten all over the Maldives, cooked or steamed with salt to taste, and eaten with grated coconut along with chili paste and fish soup. It is also prepared  as a curry. The roots are sliced and fried to make chips and are also used to prepare varieties of sweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero-Frias|first=Xavier|title=Eating on the Islands|journal=[[Himal Southasian|HIMĀL Southasian]]|volume=26|pages=69–91|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Nepal=====
[[File:Arikanchan.jpg|thumb|Arikanchan is prepared from taro leaves, black lentils paste and spices in mostely in Eastern Terai of Nepal, is traditional and indigenous food.]]
Taro is grown in the [[Terai]] and the [[Geography of nepal#The Hill Region|hilly regions]] of [[Nepal]]. The root (corm) of taro is known as ''pindalu'' (पिँडालु) and petioles with leaves are known as ''karkalo'' (कर्कलो) and also as ''Gava'' (गाभा). Almost all parts are eaten in different dishes.  Boiled corm of Taro is commonly served with salt, spices, and chilies. Taro is a popular dish in the hilly region. Chopped leaves and petioles are mixed with ''Urad'' bean flour to make dried balls called ''maseura'' (मस्यौरा). Large taro leaves are used as an alternative to an umbrella when unexpected rain occurs. Popular attachment to taro since ancient times is reflected in popular culture, such as in songs and textbooks. ''Jivan hamro karkala ko pani jastai ho'' (जिवन हाम्रो कर्कलाको पानी जस्तै हो) means, "Our life is as vulnerable as water stuck in the leaf of taro".

Taro is cultivated and eaten by the [[Tharu people]] in the [[Inner Terai Valleys of Nepal|Inner Terai]] as well.  Roots are mixed with dried fish and turmeric, then dried in cakes called ''sidhara'' which are curried with radish, chili, garlic and other spices to accompany rice.  The Tharu prepare the leaves in a fried vegetable side-dish that also shows up in [[Maithil]]i cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mithilacuisine.blogspot.com/|title=Mithila Cuisine|work=mithilacuisine.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pakistan=====
[[File:Arvi Gosht.jpg|thumb|left|Arvi gosht]]
In Pakistan, taro or ''eddoe'' or ''arvi'' is a very common dish served with or without gravy; a popular dish is ''arvi gosht'', which includes beef, lamb or mutton. The leaves are rolled along with gram flour batter and then fried or steamed to make a dish called ''Pakora'', which is finished by tempering with red chilies and carrom ([[ajwain]]) seeds. Taro or ''arvi'' is also cooked with chopped spinach. The dish called ''Arvi Palak'' is the second most renowned dish made of Taro.

=====Sri Lanka=====
Many varieties are recorded in Sri Lanka, several being edible, others being toxic to humans and therefore not cultivated. Edible varieties (''kiri ala'', ''kolakana ala'', ''gahala'', and ''sevel ala'') are cultivated for their corms and leaves. Sri Lankans eat corms after boiling them or making them into a curry with coconut milk. The leaves of only one variety, ''kolakana ala,'' are eaten.

====Middle East and Europe====
Taro was consumed by the early Romans in much the same way the potato is today. They called this root vegetable ''colocasia''. The Roman cookbook ''[[Apicius]]'' mentions several methods for preparing taro, including boiling, preparing with sauces, and cooking with meat or fowl. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the use of taro dwindled in Europe. This was largely due to the decline of trade and commerce with Egypt, previously controlled by Rome. It is important to note when the Spanish and Portuguese sailed to the new world, they brought taro along with them. Recently{{When|date=April 2011}} there has been renewed interest in exotic foods and consumption is increasing.

=====Cyprus=====
In [[Cyprus]], taro has been in use since the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. Today it is known as ''kolokas'' in Turkish or ''kolokasi'' (κολοκάσι) in Greek, which comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] name κολοκάσιον (''kolokasion'') for [[lotus root]]. It is usually sauteed with [[celery]] and [[onion]] with pork or [[chicken]], in a [[tomato sauce]] – a vegetarian version is also available. The cormlets are called ''poulles'' (sing. ''poulla''), and they are prepared by first being sauteed, followed by decaramelising the vessel with [[dry wine|dry]] [[red wine]] and [[coriander seed]]s, and finally served with freshly squeezed [[lemon]].

=====Egypt=====
In Egypt, taro is known as ''qolqas'' ({{lang-arz|قلقاس}}, {{IPA-arz|ʔolˈʔæːs|IPA}}). The corms are larger than what would be found in [[North America]]n supermarkets. After being peeled completely, it is cooked in one of two ways. It is cut into small cubes and cooked in broth with fresh [[coriander]] and [[chard]] and served as an accompaniment to meat [[stew]], or it may be sliced and cooked with [[Ground meat|minced meat]] and tomato sauce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egyptian-cuisine-recipes.com/vegetables/colcasia-%D9%82%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B3.html|title=Colcasia قلقاس|website=egyptian-cuisine-recipes.com|accessdate=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the army, the "black dish" ({{lang|arz|الطبخة السودا}} ''al-ṭabkha al-sawda'') is a combination of [[eggplant]]s and unpeeled taro halves.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=====Greece=====
In Greece, taro grows on [[Icaria]]. Icarians credit taro for saving them from famine during [[World War II]]. They boil it until tender and serve it as a [[salad]].

=====Lebanon=====
In Lebanon, taro is known as ''kilkass'' and is grown mainly along the Mediterranean coast. The leaves and stems are not consumed in Lebanon and the variety grown produces round to slightly oblong tubers that vary in size from a tennis ball to a small cantaloupe. ''Kilkass'' is a very popular winter dish in Lebanon and is prepared in two ways: ''kilkass'' with lentils is a stew flavored with crushed garlic and lemon juice and ''’il’as'' ([[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese pronunciation]] of {{linktext|قلقاس|lang=ar}}) ''bi-[[tahini]]''. Another common method of preparing taro is to boil, peel then slice it into {{cvt|1|cm}} thick slices, before frying and marinating in edible "red" [[sumac]].
In northern Lebanon, it is known as a potato with the name ''borshoushi'' (''el-orse borshushi''). It is also prepared as part of a lentil soup with crushed garlic and lemon juice. Also in the north, it is known by the name ''bouzmet'', mainly around [[Miniyeh|Menieh]], where it is first peeled, and left to dry in the sun for a couple of days. After that, it is stir-fried in lots of vegetable oil in a casserole until golden brown, then a large amount of wedged, melted onions are added, in addition to water, chickpeas and some seasoning. These are all left to simmer for a few hours, and the result is a stew-like dish. It is considered a hard-to-make delicacy, not only because of the tedious preparation but the consistency and flavour that the taro must reach. The smaller variety of taro is more popular in the north due to its tenderness.
=====Portugal=====
In the [[Azores]] taro is known as ''inhame'' or ''inhame-coco'' and is commonly steamed with potatoes, [[vegetable]]s and [[meat]]s or [[fish]]. It is also consumed as a [[dessert]] after first being steamed and peeled, then fried in [[vegetable oil]] or [[lard]], and finally sprinkled with [[sugar]]. Taro grows in the fertile land of the Azores, as well as in creeks that are fed by mineral springs. Through migration to other countries, the ''inhame'' is found in the Azorean diaspora.

=====Spain=====
Taro root is consumed in the south of Spain. Taro has remained popular in the [[Canary Islands]]. In the Canary Islands it is known as ''ñame'' and is often used in thick vegetable stews, like ''potaje de berros'' (cress [[potage]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.culturatradicionalgc.org/Gastronomia-Tradicional/Primer-Plato/Potaje-de-Berros.html |title=Potaje de Berros  |website=culturatradicionalgc.org |access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taro is called ''ñame'' (which normally designates [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]]) in [[Spanish language|Canarian Spanish]] and is a common crop in the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands (Canary Islands, Spain).

=====Turkey=====
Taro ({{lang-tr|gölevez}}) is grown in the south coast of [[Turkey]], especially in [[Mersin]], [[Bozyazı]], [[Anamur]] and [[Antalya]]. It is boiled in a [[tomato sauce]] or cooked with meat, beans and [[chickpea]]s. It is often used as a substitute for [[potato]].

====Africa====

=====East Africa=====
[[File:Njahi, Nduma, Chapati, Kachumbari, chicken - an average Kikuyu party mix.JPG|thumb|Njahi, Nduma, Chapati, Kachumbari, chicken - an average Kikuyu party mix]]
In [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]], taro is commonly known as ''arrow root'', ''ggobe'', or ''nduma'' and ''madhumbe'' in some local [[Bantu languages]]. It is usually boiled and eaten with [[tea]] or other beverages, or as the main [[starch]] of a meal. It is also cultivated in [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Zimbabwe]].

=====South Africa=====
It is known as ''amadumbe'' (plural) or ''idumbe'' (singular) in the Zulu language of Southern Africa.

=====West Africa=====
[[File:Pileuse de taro.jpg|thumb|left|Preparing taro in Cameroon]]
Taro is consumed as a [[staple crop]] in [[West Africa]], particularly in [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]].  It is called ''cocoyam'' in Nigeria, Ghana and Anglophone Cameroon, ''[[macabo]]'' in [[Francophone Cameroon]], and ''ede'' in [[Igbo language]]. ''Cocoyam'' is often boiled, fried, or roasted and eaten with a sauce. In Ghana, it substitutes for [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] in making ''[[fufu]]'' when plantains are out of season. It is also cut into small pieces to make a soupy baby food and appetizer called ''mpotompoto''. It is also common in Ghana to find ''cocoyam chips'' (deep-fried slices, about {{cvt|1|mm}} thick). ''Cocoyam'' leaves, locally called ''kontomire'' in Ghana, are a popular vegetable for local sauces such as [[palaver sauce]] and [[egusi]]/agushi stew.&lt;ref&gt;ghanaian cuisine&lt;/ref&gt; It is also commonly consumed in Guinea and parts of Senegal, as a leaf sauce or as a vegetable side, and is referred to as ''jaabere'' in the local [[Pulaar]] dialect.

====Americas====

=====Brazil=====
In [[List of territorial entities where Portuguese is an official language|Lusophone countries]], ''inhame'' (pronounced {{IPA-pt|ĩ&amp;thinsp;ˈ&amp;thinsp;ȷ̃ɐ̃mi|}}, {{IPA-pt|ˈ&amp;thinsp;ȷ̃ɐ̃mi|}} or {{IPA-pt|ĩˑˈɲɐ̃mi|}}, literally "[[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]") and ''cará'' are the common names for various plants with edible parts of the genera ''[[Alocasia]]'', ''[[Colocasia]]'' (family [[Araceae]]) and ''[[Dioscorea]]'' (family [[Dioscoreaceae]]), and its respective starchy edible parts, generally [[tuber]]s, with the exception of ''[[Dioscorea bulbifera]]'', called ''cará-moela'' (pronounced {{IPA-pt|kɐˈɾa muˈɛlɐ|}}, literally, "[[gizzard]] yam"), in Brazil and never deemed to be an ''inhame''. Definitions of what constitutes an ''inhame'' and a ''cará'' vary regionally, but the common understanding in [[Brazil]] is that ''carás'' are potato-like in shape, while ''inhames'' are more oblong.

In the "broad" lower class [[Brazilian Portuguese]] of the hotter and drier [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern region]], both ''inhames'' and ''carás'' are called ''batata'' (literally, "potato"). For differentiation, potatoes are called ''batata-inglesa'' (literally, "English potato"), a name used in other regions and [[sociolect]]s to differentiate it from the ''batata-doce'', "[[sweet potato]]", ironic names since both were first cultivated by the indigenous peoples of [[South America]], their native continent, and only later [[Columbian Exchange|introduced in Europe]] by the colonizers.

Taros are often prepared like potatoes, eaten boiled, stewed or mashed, generally with salt and sometimes [[garlic]] as a condiment, as part of a meal (most often lunch or dinner).

=====Central America=====
In [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Panama]], taro is eaten in [[soup]]s, as a replacement for potatoes, and as chips. It is known locally as ''malanga'' (also ''malanga coco'') in Costa Rica, ''quiquizque'' in Nicaragua, and as ''otoe'' in Panama.

=====Haiti=====
In [[Haiti]], it is usually called ''malanga'', or ''taro''. The corm is grated into a paste and deep-fried to make a fritter called ''Acra''. ''Acra'' is a very popular street food in Haiti.

=====Jamaica=====
In [[Jamaica]], taro is known as ''coco'', ''[[cocoyam]]'' and ''dasheen''. Corms with flesh which is white throughout are referred to as ''minty-coco''. The leaves are also used to make [[callaloo]].

=====Suriname=====
In [[Suriname]] it is called ''tayer'', ''taya'', ''pomtayer'' or ''pongtaya''. The taro root is called ''aroei'' by the native Indians and is commonly known as "Chinese ''tayer''". The variety known as ''eddoe'' is also called Chinese ''tayer''. It is a popular cultivar among the maroon population in the interior, also because it is not adversely affected by high water levels. The ''dasheen'' variety, commonly planted in swamps, is rare, although appreciated for its taste. The closely related ''Xanthosoma'' species is the base for the popular Surinamese dish, [[Pom (dish)|pom]].

=====Trinidad &amp; Tobago=====
In [[Trinidad and Tobago]], it is called ''dasheen''. The leaves of the taro plant are used to make the Trinidadian variant of the Caribbean dish known as [[callaloo]] (which is made with okra, ''dasheen''/taro leaves, coconut milk or creme and aromatic herbs) and it is also prepared similarly to steamed spinach. The root of the taro plant is often served boiled, accompanied by stewed fish or meat, curried, often with peas and eaten with roti, or in soups.

=====United States=====
[[File:Taro sticks for sale.jpg|thumb|Taro leaf-stems ([[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]s) for sale at a market in California, 2009]]
In American [[Chinatown]]s, people often use taro in [[Chinese cuisine]], though it is not as popular as in [[Asia]]n and [[Oceania|Pacific nations]]. Since the late 20th century, taro chips have been available in many supermarkets and natural food stores. In the 1920s, ''dasheen''{{refn|group=nb|The word ''dasheen'' originated in [[Trinidad]] and is said to be a corruption of ''de la Chine'' or ''da Chine'', i.e. ''taro de la Chine''.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;Robert A. Young. [https://books.google.com/books?id=g31NAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA11-PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Dasheen: A Root Crop for the Southern States."] Circular 127-C. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Plant Industry, 17 May 1913. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}, as it was known, was highly touted by the Secretary of the Florida Department of Agriculture as a valuable crop for growth in [[muck (soil)|muck]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112019277166;view=2up;seq=10|title=The dasheen: a tropical root crop for the South / [by W.H. Hodge].|website=HathiTrust Digital Library|publisher=Washington, D.C. : U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, 1954.|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fellsmere, Florida]], near the east coast, was a farming area deemed perfect for growing ''dasheen''. It was used in place of potatoes and dried to make flour. ''Dasheen'' flour was said to make excellent pancakes when mixed with wheat flour.

=====Venezuela=====
[[File:Sopa de Gallina.JPG|thumb|left|Chopped taro for preparing [[sopa de gallina]]]]
In Venezuela, taro is called ''ocumo chino'' or ''chino'' and used in soups and ''[[sancocho]]s''. Soups contain large chunks of several kinds of tubers, including ''ocumo chino'', especially in the eastern part of the country, where West Indian influence is present. It is also used to accompany meats in ''parrillas'' (barbecue) or fried cured fish where [[Cassava|yuca]] is not available. ''Ocumo'' is an indigenous name; ''chino'' means "Chinese", an adjective for produce that is considered exotic. ''Ocumo'' without the Chinese denomination is a tuber from the same family, but without taro's inside purplish color. ''Ocumo'' is the Venezuelan name for [[Xanthosoma|malanga]], so ''ocumo chino'' means "Chinese malanga". Taro is always prepared boiled. No porridge form is known in the local cuisine.

=====West Indies=====
Taro is called ''dasheen'',&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt; in contrast to the smaller variety of corms called ''[[Eddoe|eddo]]'', or ''tanya'' in the English speaking countries of the [[West Indies]], and is cultivated and consumed as a staple crop in the region. There are differences among the roots mentioned above: taro or ''dasheen'' is mostly blue when cooked, ''tanya'' is white and very dry, and ''eddoes'' are small and very slimy.

In the Spanish speaking countries of the [[Spanish West Indies]] taro is called ''ñame'', the Portuguese variant of which (''inhame'') is used in former Portuguese colonies where taro is still cultivated, including the [[Azores]] and [[Brazil]].  In [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Cuba]], and the Dominican Republic it is sometimes called ''malanga'' or ''yautia''.  In some countries, such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], and [[Dominica]], the leaves and stem of the ''dasheen'', or taro, are most often cooked and pureed into a thick liquid called [[callaloo]], which is served as a side dish similar to creamed spinach. ''Callaloo'' is sometimes prepared with [[crab]] legs, coconut milk, pumpkin, and okra. It is usually served alongside rice or made into a soup along with various other roots.

=== Ornamental ===
It is also sold as an ornamental [[aquatic plant]].

=== Laboratory ===
It is also used for [[anthocyanin]] study experiments especially with reference to abaxial and adaxial anthocyanic concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Nicole M|last2=Carpenter|first2=Kaylyn L|last3=Keidel|first3=Timothy S|last4=Miller|first4=Charlene N|last5=Waters|first5=Matthew N|last6=Smith|first6=William K|year=2014|title=Photosynthetic costs and benefits of abaxial versus adaxial anthocyanins in Colocasia esculenta 'Mojito'|journal=Planta|volume=240|issue=5|pages=971–981|doi=10.1007/s00425-014-2090-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Du Noüy–Padday method''' is a minimized version of the [[Du Noüy ring method]] replacing the large platinum ring with a thin rod that is used to measure equilibrium surface tension or dynamic surface tension at an air–liquid interface. In this method, the rod is oriented perpendicular to the interface, and the force exerted on it is measured. Based on the work of Padday,&lt;ref name="Padday"&gt;Padday, J. F., Pitt, A. R., Pashley, R. M.,1974, "Menisci at a free liquid surface: surface tension from the maximum pull on a rod",J. Chem. Soc., Far. Trans. I, 71(10), 1919–1931 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; this method finds wide use in the preparation and monitoring of [[Langmuir–Blodgett film]]s, ink &amp; coating development, pharmaceutical screening, and academic research.

==Detailed description==
The Du Noüy Padday rod consists of a rod usually on the order of a few millimeters square making a small ring. The rod is often made from a composite metal material that may be roughened to ensure complete [[wetting]] at the interface. The rod is cleaned with water, alcohol and a flame or with strong acid to ensure complete removal of surfactants.  The rod is attached to a scale or balance via a thin metal hook. The Padday method uses the maximum pull force method, i.e. the maximum force due to the surface tension is recorded as the probe is first immersed ca. one mm into the solution and then slowly withdrawn from the interface. The main forces acting on a probe are the buoyancy (due to the volume of liquid displaced by the probe) and the mass of the meniscus adhering to the probe. This is an old, reliable, and well-documented technique.&lt;ref name="Padday" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, H., Gottschlich, R., Seelig, A., "Blood-Brain Barrier Permeation: Molecular Parameters Governing Passive Diffusion" J.Membrane Biol. 165, 201–211 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian, S. D., Slage, A. R., Tucker, E. E., and Scamehorn, J. F., "Inverted Vertical Pull Surface Tension Method", Langmuir, 14(X), 3126–3128 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harkins, W. D., and Jordan H. F., "A method for the determination of surface and interfacial tension from the maximum pull on a ring", J. Am. Chem. Soc., 52(5), 1751–1772 (1930)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freud, B. B., and Freud H. Z., "A theory of the ring method for the determination of surface tension", J. Am. Chem. Soc., 52(5), 1772–1782 (1930)&lt;/ref&gt;

An important advantage of the maximum pull force technique is that the receding contact angle on the probe is effectively zero. The maximum pull force is obtained when the buoyancy force reaches its minimum,

The surface tension measurement used in the Padday devices based on the Du Noüy ring/maximum pull force method is explained further here:

The force acting on the probe can be divided into two components: 
: i) Buoyancy stemming from the volume displaced by the probe, and
: ii) the mass of the meniscus of the liquid adhering to the probe.
The latter is in equilibrium with the surface tension force, i.e.

::&lt;math&gt;\tau_p \gamma \cos \theta = m_m g&lt;/math&gt;

where
:* &lt;math&gt;\tau_p&lt;/math&gt; is the perimeter of the probe,
:* &lt;math&gt;m_m&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension and the weight of the meniscus under the probe. In the situation considered here the volume displaced by the probe is included in the meniscus.
:* &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the contact angle between the probe and the solution that is measured, and is negligible for the majority of solutions with Kibron’s probes.

Thus, the force measured by the balance is given by

::&lt;math&gt;F_p = m_m g + F_{buoayancy} = \tau_p\gamma\ + F_{buoyancy}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:* &lt;math&gt;F_p&lt;/math&gt; is the force acting on the probe and
:* &lt;math&gt;F_{buoyancy}&lt;/math&gt; is the force due to buoyancy.

At the point of detachment the volume of the probe immersed in the solution vanishes, and thus, also the buoyancy term. This is observed as a maximum in the force curve, which relates to the surface tension through

::&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{F_{max}}{\tau_p}&lt;/math&gt;

The above derivation holds for ideal conditions. Non-idealities, e.g. from defect probe shape, are partly compensated in the calibration routine using a solution with known surface tension.

==Advantages and practice==

Unlike a Du Noüy ring, no correction factors are required when calculating surface tensions.  Due to its small size the rod can be used in high throughput instruments that use a 96-well plate to determine the surface tension.  The small diameter of the rod allows its use in a small volume of liquid with 50 &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;l samples being used in some devices.&lt;ref&gt;Suomalainen, P., Johans, C., Söderlund, T., and Kinnunen P. K.J., “Surface Activity Profiling of Drugs Applied to the Prediction of Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability,” J. Med. Chem., 47(7), 1783–1788 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the rod also allows use for the Wilhelmy method because the rod is not completely removed during measurements.  For this the dynamic surface tension can be used for accurate determination of surface kinetics on a wide range of timescales.

The Padday technique also offers low operator variance and does not need an anti-vibration table.  This advantage over other devices allows the Padday devices to be used in the field easily.  The rod when made of composite material is also less likely to bend and therefore cheaper than the more costly platinum rod offered in the Du Noüy method.

In a typical experiment, the rod is lowered using a manual or automatic device to the surface being analyzed until a meniscus is formed, and then raised so that the bottom edge of the rod lies on the plane of the undisturbed surface.  One disadvantage of this technique is that it can not bury the rod into the surface to measure interfacial tension between two liquids.

==Practical uses==

The practical uses of an instrument that uses a single probe are that it allows for the developing of a high throughput device.  A high throughput surface tension device can be used for formulation in real time for understanding the penetration of drugs in the [[Blood brain barrier|blood–brain barrier (BBB)]], understanding the solubility of drugs, development of a screen to test a drugs toxicity, determining the physicochemical properties of oxidized phospholipids, and development of new surfactant/polymers.

=== Penetration of drugs in the BBB ===
The physicochemical profiling of poorly soluble drug candidates performed using a [[High-throughput screening|HTS]] surface tension device.  Allowed prediction of penetration through the [[Blood brain barrier|blood–brain barrier]].

=== Development of a screen to test a drugs toxicity ===
A correlation with drug-lipid-complexes were correlated with high-throughput surface tension device to predict [[phospholipidosis]] in particular cationic drugs.

=== Understanding the solubility of drugs ===
Drug solubility has previously been done by the shaker method.  A 96-well high throughput device has allowed development of a new method to test drugs.

=== Oxidized Phospholipids ===
The physicochemical properties of oxidized lipids were characterized using a high throughput device.  Since these oxidized lipids are expensive and only available in small quantities a surface tension device requiring only a small amount of volume is better.

=== Development of new surfactant/polymers ===
The surface tension profiles of the branched copolymers solutions were
performed using a [[High-throughput screening|HTS]] surface tensiometer as a function polymer concentration to produce pH-triggered aggregation emulsion droplets.

Launched at the beginning of 2005 with support from the Intelligent Energy Europe programme. the '''ECOHEATCOOL''' project carried out by [[Euroheat &amp; Power]], in cooperation with 13 partners across Europe was concluded at the end of December 2006. 

The project assessed the [[heating]] and [[Air conditioning|cooling]] markets, looked for possibilities for more [[district heating]] and [[district cooling]] in [[Europe]], provided recommendations for [[policy makers]] and developed a tool for assessing the efficiency of district heating and cooling systems.  The project showed that district heating and cooling grids make it possible to optimally use and combine a large spectrum of "free" energy inputs: surplus heat from [[electricity]] production based on conventional or [[renewable fuels]], from [[waste incineration]] and/or from industrial processes as well as different forms of renewable heat (i.e. geothermal, heat/cold from deep-sea or lake water).

The Ecoheatcool project became a reference for [[district heating]] and cooling sector, its findings being used in the arguments provided to [[European Union]] and national policy makers. It enabled the development of a vision, quantification of the benefits which the district heating and cooling sector can bring to achieving the EU policy objectives: [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], environmental protection, [[security of supply]], use of [[renewable energy sources]], avoided investments in peak electricity capacities, and evaluation of the costs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3699">{{Renewable energy sources}}'''Energy supply''' is the delivery of fuels or transformed fuels to point of consumption. It potentially encompasses the [[Resource extraction|extraction]], [[energy transmission|transmission]], [[Power station|generation]], [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[energy storage|storage of fuel]]s.  It is also sometimes called '''energy flow'''.

This supply of energy can be disrupted by several factors, including imposition of higher energy prices due to action by [[OPEC]] or other [[cartel]], war, political disputes, economic disputes, or physical damage to the energy infrastructure due to [[terrorism]].  The [[Energy security|security of the energy supply]] is a major concern of [[national security]] and [[energy law]].

== Other uses ==
Some sources refer to "energy supply" when actually referring to the [[oil reserves]] or other potential sources of energy.

[[New York Statutes]] includes a statutory code called "[[New York energy law|Energy Law]]".&lt;ref name=NYLaw&gt;N.Y. Energy Law § 1-101, found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS New York State Legislature official web site], go to "ENG", then "Article 1", finally "1–101 – Short title". Accessed January 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 21 of this code is called "Energy Supply and Production", but rather than a comprehensive code, only consists of one section dealing with renewable energy.&lt;ref name=NYLaw /&gt;

'''Exxon donor solvent process''' (EDS) is a [[coal liquefaction process]] developed by [[Exxon Corporation|Exxon Research and Engineering Company]], starting in 1966.  The process converts solid coal directly to liquid [[synthetic fuel]]s which could be used as a substitute for [[petroleum products]]. The process does not involve an intermediate step of [[coal gasification]].  Exxon operated a pilot plant in Texas from 1980 until 1982.

==History==
Exxon started to develop this process in 1966 and the development process continued until 1976.&lt;ref name=mcguckin&gt;

== Process ==
The Exxon donor solvent process is a non-catalytic processing of [[Coal slurry|solvent-slurried]] coal in a high-pressure [[liquefaction]] reactor. Coal is cleaned, crushed and fed to the slurry dryer, where water is removed. The dry crushed coal is slurried with the hydrogen donor recycle solvent. The coal slurry is treated with hydrogen and heated in a liquefaction slurry furnace. The liquefaction occurs at {{convert|840|°F|°C}} and {{convert|2000|psi}}. The process produces gas and liquids. After separation of gas from liquids and remaining solids, the gas is cooled to separate vaporized [[naptha]], and scrubbed to remove [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen gas]], and [[carbon monoxide]]. The remaining gas is treated with hydrogen, and reused in the liquefaction reactor. Liquids, remaining solids, and condensate from the process gas are treated in [[fractionator]]s for separating naptha, a spent solvent, and [[vacuum gas oil]]. Naptha is processed into different hydrocarbon products while spent solvent hydrogenated before reusing in the slurry drier.&lt;ref name=mcguckin/&gt;

By this process from {{convert|1|ST|spell=in|3}} of dry, high volatile coal can be produced more than {{convert|2.6|oilbbl}} of a synthetic fuel.&lt;ref name="neavel"&gt;

[[File:FDG tomato paste.jpg|thumb|Fluid dynamic gauging of a soft deposit layer (tomato paste)]]
A '''fluid dynamic gauge''' (FDG) is a measurement technique used to study the behaviour of soft deposit layers in a liquid environment. It employs [[fluid mechanics]] to determine the thickness of the layer, and can also be used to obtain a measure of its strength. It was inspired by the technique of [[pneumatic]] gauging, which relies on a flow of air rather than the process liquid. Fluid dynamic gauging can be conducted as an in-line measuring technique, but is more commonly used as a research tool. 

The technique was originally developed to measure the buildup or removal of the fouling layers commonly encountered in the process industry (such as in the heat treatment of [[dairy products]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Key features of the technique are that it can study soft deposit layers without touching them, relies on relatively simple operating principles, can be used in a completely opaque liquid, and does not rely on knowledge of the fluid or deposit properties.

'''GEO-2000''' is the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) Global Environment Outlook 2000.

The UNEP launched the [[Global Environment Outlook]] in 1995 to assess environmental issues and to have them published. The first report was published in 1999.

As well as some of the more well known issues the report identified new threats such as:
* [[nitrogen]]'s harmful impact on ecosystems
* increased severity of natural disasters
* species invasion as a result of globalization
* increased environmental pressures caused by urbanization
* decline in the quality of governance in some countries
* new wars which impact on both the immediate environment and neighbouring states
* the impact of refugees on the natural environment

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3115">'''Havar''', or '''UNS R30005''', is an [[alloy]] of [[cobalt]], possessing very high mechanical strength. It can be [[heat treating|heat-treated]]. It is highly resistant to [[corrosion]] and is non-[[magnetic]]. It is [[biocompatible]]. It has high [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] resistance. It is a [[precipitation hardening]] [[superalloy]].

Havar is composed of 42.0% (41-44%) of cobalt, 19.5% (19-21%) of [[chromium]], 12.7% (12-14%) of [[nickel]], 2.7% (2.3-3.3%) of [[tungsten]], 2.2% (2-2.8%) of [[molybdenum]], 1.6% (1.35-1.8%) of [[manganese]], 0.2% (0.17-0.23%) of [[carbon]], 0.02-0.08% of [[beryllium]], and balance of [[iron]]. Its melting point is about 1480&amp;nbsp;°C. It will retain three quarters of its room temperature strengths up to 510&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpmetals.com/download/Havar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=7658&lt;/ref&gt; Its density is 8.3 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Its [[thermal conductivity]] is 13.0 W/m·K. Its [[tensile strength]] is 960-970 MPa and its [[modulus of elasticity]] is 200-210 GPa. It can be joined by [[welding]] ([[GMAW]] and [[resistance welding]], [[soldering]] and [[brazing]].

Havar foils of various thickness are used as diaphragms for pressure sensing in [[process control]] equipment, biocompatible [[medical implant]]s, as [[particle beam]] windows in nuclear physics, and various other high temperature applications.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americanelements.com/havar-alloy-foil&lt;/ref&gt;

Havar foils are frequently used as window material for high-energy [[proton beam]]s used in production of [[fluorine-18]] from [[oxygen-18]] enriched water.

Havar was originally developed in the late 1940s by [[Hamilton Watch Company]] as an alloy for the [[mainspring]]s used in [[watch]]es, and named Dynavar. Later it was used as sensing diaphragms and other uses, under its current name Havar. Its corrosion resistance allows use in [[stress corrosion]] resistant springs and diaphragms in oilfield equipment handling [[sour crude oil]]. Havar outperforms [[316L]] stainless steel in resistance to [[pitting corrosion]] and [[crevice corrosion]] in medical implant environment.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=Jv1Wysf1jv8C&amp;pg=PA324-IA1&amp;dq=havar+alloy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=havar%20alloy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In cold-rolled and aged form, its yield and tensile strength are higher than of other cobalt-based implant alloys.

In [[Green death]], the Havar alloy does not corrode at all at [[room temperature]], starts corroding rapidly (15&amp;nbsp;mm/year) at 70&amp;nbsp;°C, and reaches rate of 56&amp;nbsp;mm/year at boiling point.

Havar is difficult to machine, as it undergoes rapid [[work hardening]] under the cutting tool. The tool should be as sharp as possible and the machine should be rigid, with minimal backlash. Higher power is required than to machine ordinary steels of similar hardness.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=IePhmnbmRWkC&amp;pg=PA397&amp;dq=havar+alloy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=havar%20alloy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermann Scheer''' (29 April 1944 – 14 October 2010) was a [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] member of the [[German Bundestag]] (parliament), President of [[Eurosolar]] (European Association for Renewable Energy) and General Chairman of the [[World Council for Renewable Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dea.org.au/node/144 Book Review: Energy Autonomy. The economic, social and technological case for renewable energy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829042357/http://dea.org.au/node/144 |date=29 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Scheer was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]] for his "indefatigable work for the promotion of [[solar energy]] worldwide".&lt;ref name=RLA&gt;[http://www.rightlivelihood.org/scheer.html Right Livelihood Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040022/http://www.rightlivelihood.org/scheer.html |date=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheer believed that the continuation of current patterns of energy supply and use would be environmentally, socially, economically, and politically damaging, with [[renewable energy]] being the only realistic alternative. Scheer had concluded that it is technically and environmentally feasible to harness enough solar radiation to achieve a total replacement of the foclear (fossil/nuclear) energy system by a global [[renewable energy economy]]. The main obstacle to such a change is seen to be political, not technical or economic.&lt;ref name=RLA /&gt; In 1999 he was one of the initiators of the [[Feed-in tariffs in Germany|German feed-in tariffs]] that were the major source of the rise of [[Renewable energy in Germany|renewable energies in Germany]] during the following years.

==Life==
Scheer was born in [[Wehrheim]], and became a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] in 1965 during his military service as an officer in the Bundeswehr. He [[wikt:majoring|majored]] in [[economics]] and [[law]] and was active in student politics at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. 1979 he graduated  from the [[Free University of Berlin]] as a doctor of [[political science]]. He worked as postgrade scientist at [[Universität Stuttgart]] and as a scientist (1976 till 1980) at [[Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe]] (a large nuclear and basic research center). Scheer was member of the German [[Modern pentathlon]] national team in his youth. He became a member of the [[Bundestag]] in 1980, representing [[Baden-Württemberg]]; in 1993, he also became a member of the federal steering committee (''Bundesvorstand'') of the Social Democratic Party. Scheer had a solid track record as an anti-establishment figure within his own party. He however never gained a direct majority based mandate in any political election and never held any executive post in government.

In the preelection shadow cabinet of [[Andrea Ypsilanti]], candidate for prime minister of [[Hesse]] in 2008, Scheer was pegged unsuccessfully as minister for development, environment and economics. The final list long after the election mentioned him as secretary of a downsized ministry of economics{{Clarify|date=April 2012}}&lt;ref name ="wind"&gt;[[Spiegel Online]] 03. November 2008, 09:25, Hermann Scheer Ypsilantis Windmacher (Scheer- Ypsilantis Windmaker). Carsten Volkery&lt;/ref&gt; Scheer announced ambitious energy policy plans, which failed to gain applause with his own party and possible coalition partners.&lt;ref name ="wind"/&gt; Leading SPD figures as [[Jürgen Walter (SPD)|Jürgen Walter]] and [[Wolfgang Clement]], a former Ministerpräsident which later left the party were rather critical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Die Welt]]: ''[https://www.welt.de/politik/article1571459/Clement_warnt_vor_Wahl_von_Andrea_Ypsilanti.html Clement warnt vor Wahl von Andrea Ypsilanti],'' 19. Januar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Scheer however believed Ypsilanti's strategies would result in a big triumph of his party at the federal elections 2009. However Ypsilanti's post election 'read my lips' attempt to partner with ex-communist [[Linkspartei]] and the Greens led to a complete failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/bundestagswahl-2009-scheer-prophezeit-spd-triumph_aid_344358.html] 29.10.2008 [[Focus (German magazine)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

His book [[Energy Autonomy]] was instrumental in the making of the film [[Die 4. Revolution – Energy Autonomy]]. Scheer advocated for the municipal ownership of utility companies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/kino/0,1518,684054,00.html Der Spiegel] (german) "2006 Idea"&lt;/ref&gt;, and was a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/?mapcountry=allhea&amp;mapgroup=hea|title=Supporters|last=|first=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|date=|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He suddenly died in a hospital in Berlin from heart failure&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,723373,00.html Der Spiegel]&lt;/ref&gt; after an unspecified short and severe illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stern.de/politik/spd-umweltexperte-hermann-scheer-gestorben-1614032.html Der Stern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018054010/http://www.stern.de/politik/spd-umweltexperte-hermann-scheer-gestorben-1614032.html |date=18 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife (since 1970), Irm Pontenagel, managed the solar lobby association [[Eurosolar]] for decades.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1323">[[Image:Wechselstromerzeuger.jpg|right|thumb|An early form of an alternating current electrical generator built by Pixii]]
'''Hippolyte Pixii''' (1808–1835) was an instrument maker from Paris, France. In 1832 he built an early form of [[alternating current]] electrical generator, based on the principle of [[electromagnetic induction]] discovered by [[Michael Faraday]]. Pixii's device was a spinning magnet, operated by a hand crank, where the north and south [[Magnet|pole]]s passed over a coil with an iron core. A current pulse was experienced each time a pole passed over the coil. He also found that the current direction changed when the north pole passed over the coil after the south pole. Later, acting on a suggestion by [[André-Marie Ampère]], other results were obtained by introducing a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] which produced a pulsating [[direct current]]. At that time direct current was preferable to alternating current. Although Pixii did not fully understand electromagnetic induction, his device led to more sophisticated devices being constructed.

The '''International POPs Elimination Network''' ('''IPEN''') is a global network of [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s dedicated to the common aim of eliminating [[persistent organic pollutants]].

IPEN is composed of public interest non-governmental organizations who support a common platform for the global elimination of POPs. The Participating Organizations (POs) of IPEN are those NGOs which have endorsed the POPs Elimination Platform and/or the Stockholm Declaration. Because the network is primarily engaged in facilitating information exchange and in supporting activities of its constituents, and because the purpose of the network does not include developing network-wide-policy statements, strategies, or action plans, a formal decision-making process for the network can be simple, flexible, and largely administrative in nature. (IPEN 2005)

The International POPs Elimination Network (IPEN) is a global network of more than 600 public interest non-governmental organizations working together for the elimination of persistent organic pollutants, on an expedited yet socially equitable basis. This mission includes achieving a world in which all chemicals are produced and used in ways that eliminate significant adverse effects on human health and the environment, and where persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and chemicals of equivalent concern no longer pollute our local and global environments, and no longer contaminate our communities, our food, our bodies, or the bodies of our children and future generations.

[[File:NEXIS thruster working.jpg|thumb|right|200px|NEXIS ion engine test (2005)]]
An '''ion thruster''' or '''ion drive''' is a form of [[electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] used for [[spacecraft propulsion]]. It creates [[thrust]] by accelerating positive [[ion]]s with [[electricity]]. The term refers strictly to gridded [[electrostatic ion thruster]]s, and is often incorrectly loosely applied to all electric propulsion systems including [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion#Electromagnetic|electromagnetic plasma thrusters]].{{cn|date=June 2018|reason=Since this article on ion thrusters includes plasma propulsion, who says this is 'incorrect'?}}

An ion thruster ionizes a neutral gas by extracting some [[electron]]s out of [[atom]]s, creating a cloud of positive ions. These thrusters rely mainly on [[electrostatics]] as ions are accelerated by the [[Coulomb force]] along an [[electric field]]. Temporarily stored electrons are finally reinjected by a ''neutralizer'' in the cloud of ions after it has passed through the electrostatic grid, so the gas becomes neutral again and can freely disperse in space without any further electrical interaction with the thruster. Electromagnetic thrusters on the contrary use the [[Lorentz force]] to accelerate all species (free electrons as well as positive and negative ions) in the same direction whatever their [[electric charge]], and are specifically referred as [[plasma propulsion engine]]s, where the electric field is not in the direction of the acceleration.&lt;ref name="Jahn 1968"&gt;{{cite book

The [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'']] spacecraft broke the record, with a [[Delta-v|velocity change]] of {{formatnum:10}}&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Choueiri" /&gt;

Applications include control of the orientation and position of orbiting [[satellite]]s (some satellites have dozens of low-power ion thrusters) and use as a main propulsion engine for low-mass robotic space vehicles (such as ''Deep Space&amp;nbsp;1'' and ''Dawn'').&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Choueiri" /&gt;

Ion thrust engines are practical only in the vacuum of space and cannot take vehicles through the atmosphere because ion engines do not work in the presence of ions outside the engine. Additionally, the engine's minuscule thrust cannot overcome any significant air resistance. Spacecraft rely on conventional chemical rockets to initially reach [[orbit]].

The first person to mention the idea publicly was [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] in 1911.&lt;ref name=choueiri /&gt; However, the first document to consider electric propulsion is [[Robert H.

A working ion thruster was built by [[Harold R. Kaufman]] in 1959 at the NASA [[Glenn Research Center]] facilities. It was similar to a gridded electrostatic ion thruster and used [[mercury (element)|mercury]] for propellant. Suborbital tests were conducted during the 1960s and in 1964, the engine was sent into a suborbital flight aboard the [[SERT-1 (spaceship)|Space Electric Rocket Test 1]] (SERT 1).&lt;ref name='Ion 1964'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/ds1.html|title=Contributions to Deep Space 1|work=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cybulski"&gt;Ronald J.

An alternate form of electric propulsion, the [[Hall effect thruster]], was studied independently in the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Hall effect thrusters operated on Soviet satellites from 1972 until the late 1990s, mainly used for satellite stabilization in North-South and in East-West directions. Some 100–200 engines completed missions on Soviet and [[Russia]]n satellites.&lt;ref name="NK"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/198/35.shtml|title=Native Electric Propulsion Engines Today|publisher=Novosti Kosmonavtiki| date= 1999| issue=7|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606033558/http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/198/35.shtml| archivedate=6 June 2011|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet thruster design was introduced to the West in 1992 after a team of electric propulsion specialists, under the support of the [[Ballistic Missile Defense Organization]], visited Soviet laboratories.

==General working principle==
Ion thrusters use beams of [[ion]]s (electrically charged atoms or molecules) to create [[thrust]] in accordance with [[momentum conservation]]. The method of accelerating the ions varies, but all designs take advantage of the [[electric charge|charge]]/[[mass]] ratio of the ions. This ratio means that relatively small potential differences can create high exhaust velocities. This reduces the amount of [[reaction mass]] or propellant required, but increases the amount of specific [[power (physics)|power]] required compared to [[chemical rocket]]s. Ion thrusters are therefore able to achieve high [[specific impulse]]s. The drawback of the low thrust is low acceleration because the mass of the electric power unit directly correlates with the amount of power. This low thrust makes ion thrusters unsuited for launching spacecraft into orbit, but effective for in-space propulsion.

Ion thrusters are categorized as either [[electrostatics|electrostatic]] or [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]]. The main difference is the method for accelerating the ions.
*Electrostatic ion thrusters use the [[Coulomb force]] and accelerate the ions in the direction of the electric field.
*Electromagnetic ion thrusters use the [[Lorentz force]] to move the ions.

Power supplies for ion thrusters are usually electric [[solar panel|solar panels,]] but at sufficiently large distances from the Sun, nuclear power is used. In each case, the power supply mass is proportional to the peak power that can be supplied, and both provide, for this application, almost no limit to the energy.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Electric thrusters tend to produce low thrust, which results in low acceleration. Defining &lt;math&gt;1g=9.81\; \mathrm{m/s^2}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Gravity of Earth|standard gravitational acceleration of Earth]], and noting that &lt;math&gt;F = ma \implies a = F/m&lt;/math&gt;, this can be analyzed. A [[NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness|NSTAR]] thruster producing a thrust force of 92&amp;nbsp;mN&lt;ref name=ns20070928/&gt; will accelerate a satellite with a mass of 1{{nbsp}}[[metric ton|Mg]] by 0.092{{nbsp}}N / 1000&amp;nbsp;kg = 9.2{{e|−5}}&amp;nbsp;m/s{{sup|2}} (or 9.38{{e|−6}}&amp;nbsp;g). However, this acceleration can be sustained for months or years at a time, in contrast to the very short burns of chemical rockets.
:&lt;math&gt;F = 2 \frac{\eta P}{g I_\text{sp}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
: ''F'' is the thrust force in N,
: ''η'' is the [[efficiency]]
: ''P'' is the electrical power used by the thruster in W, and
: ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[specific impulse]] in seconds.

The ion thruster is not the most promising type of [[electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]], but it is the most successful in practice to date.&lt;ref name="Choueiri"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Choueiri |first1= Edgar Y |year= 2009 |title= New dawn of electric rocket |url= http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v300/n2/full/scientificamerican0209-58.html |journal= [[Scientific American]] |volume= 300 |issue= |pages= 58–65 |doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican0209-58 |subscription= yes|bibcode= 2009SciAm.300b..58C }}&lt;/ref&gt; An ion drive would require two days to accelerate a car to highway speed. The technical characteristics, especially [[thrust]], are considerably inferior to the prototypes described in literature,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Choueiri" /&gt; technical capabilities are limited by the [[space charge]] created by ions. This limits the thrust density ([[force]] per cross-sectional [[area]] of the engine).&lt;ref name="Choueiri" /&gt; Ion thrusters create small thrust levels (the thrust of Deep Space 1 is approximately equal to the weight of one sheet of paper&lt;ref name="Choueiri" /&gt;) compared to conventional [[chemical rocket]]s, but achieve high [[specific impulse]], or propellant mass efficiency, by accelerating the exhaust to high speed. The [[power (physics)|power]] imparted to the exhaust increases with the square of exhaust velocity while thrust increase is linear. Conversely, chemical rockets provide high thrust, but are limited in total [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] by the small amount of [[energy]] that can be stored chemically in the propellants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=34201&amp;fbodylongid=1535 Electric Spacecraft Propulsion, Electric versus Chemical Propulsion], ESA Science &amp; Technology&lt;/ref&gt; Given the practical weight of suitable power sources, the acceleration from an ion thruster is frequently less than one thousandth of [[standard gravity]]. However, since they operate as electric (or electrostatic) motors, they convert a greater fraction of input power into kinetic exhaust power. Chemical rockets operate as [[heat engine]]s, and [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]] limits the exhaust velocity.

==Electrostatic ion thrusters==

===Gridded electrostatic ion thrusters===
{{main|Gridded ion thruster}}

[[File:Ion engine.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Figure 2: A diagram of how a gridded electrostatic ion engine (multipole magnetic cusp type) works]]
'''[[Gridded ion thruster|Gridded electrostatic ion thrusters]]''' commonly utilize [[xenon]] gas. The gaseous propellant begins with no charge; it is [[ionization|ionized]] by bombarding it with energetic electrons, as the energy transferred ejects valence electrons from the propellant gas's atoms. These electrons can be provided by a hot [[cathode]] [[electrical filament|filament]] and accelerated through the potential difference towards an anode. Alternatively, the electrons can be accelerated by an oscillating induced electric field created by an alternating electromagnet, which results in a self-sustaining discharge without a cathode (radio frequency ion thruster).

The positively charged ions are extracted by a system consisting of 2 or 3 multi-aperture grids. After entering the grid system near the plasma sheath, the ions are accelerated by the potential difference between the first grid and second grid (called the screen grid and the accelerator grid, respectively) to the final ion energy of (typically) 1–2 keV, which generates thrust.

Ion thrusters emit a beam of positively charged xenon ions. To keep the spacecraft from accumulating a charge, another [[cathode]] is placed near the engine to emit electrons into the ion beam, leaving the propellant electrically neutral. This prevents the beam of ions from being attracted (and returning) to the spacecraft, which would cancel the thrust.&lt;ref name="Glenn" /&gt;

===Hall effect thrusters===
{{main|Hall effect thruster}}

[[File:Wfm hall thruster.svg|upright=1.3|thumb|Schematic of a Hall effect thruster]]
'''[[Hall effect thruster]]s''' accelerate ions by means of an electric potential between a cylindrical anode and a negatively charged plasma that forms the cathode. The bulk of the propellant (typically xenon) is introduced near the anode, where it ionizes and flows toward the cathode; ions accelerate towards and through it, picking up electrons as they leave to neutralize the beam and leave the thruster at high velocity.

The anode is at one end of a cylindrical tube. In the center is a spike that is wound to produce a radial magnetic field between it and the surrounding tube. The ions are largely unaffected by the magnetic field, since they are too massive. However, the electrons produced near the end of the spike to create the cathode are trapped by the magnetic field and held in place by their attraction to the anode. Some of the electrons spiral down towards the anode, circulating around the spike in a Hall current. When they reach the anode they impact the uncharged propellant and cause it to be ionized, before finally reaching the anode and closing the circuit.&lt;ref name="Oleson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2001/TM-2001-210676.pdf|title=Advanced Hall Electric Propulsion for Future In-Space Transportation|accessdate=2007-11-21|last1=Oleson|first1=S.

===Field-emission electric propulsion===
{{main|Field-emission electric propulsion}}
'''[[Field-emission electric propulsion]]''' (FEEP) thrusters use either [[caesium]] or [[indium]] as the propellant. The design comprises a small propellant reservoir that stores the liquid metal, a narrow tube or a system of parallel plates that the liquid flows through and an accelerator (a ring or an elongated aperture in a metallic plate) about a millimeter past the tube end. Caesium and indium are used due to their high atomic weights, low ionization potentials and low melting points. Once the liquid metal reaches the end of the tube, an electric field applied between the emitter and the accelerator causes the liquid surface to deform into a series of protruding cusps, or ''[[Taylor cone]]s''. At a sufficiently high applied voltage, positive ions are extracted from the tips of the cones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alta-space.com/index.php?page=feep |title=FEEP - Field-Emission Electric Propulsion |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118051025/http://www.alta-space.com/index.php?page=feep |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPP98"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alta-space.com/uploads/file/publications/feep/Marcuccio-JPP14_5_1998.pdf|title=Experimental Performance of Field Emission Microthrusters|author=Marcuccio, S.|display-authors=etal|accessdate=2012-04-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520151812/http://www.alta-space.com/uploads/file/publications/feep/Marcuccio-JPP14_5_1998.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nasa"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/11649/1/02-0194.pdf |title= In-FEEP Thruster Ion Beam Neutralization with Thermionic and Field Emission Cathodes |quote= liquid state and wicked up the needle shank to the tip where high electric fields deform the liquid and extract ions and accelerate them up to 130 km/s through 10 kV. |accessdate= 2007-11-21 |first1= Colleen |last1= Marrese-Reading |first2= Jay |last2= Polk |first3= Juergen |last3= Mueller |first4= Al |last4= Owens |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061013162109/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/11649/1/02-0194.pdf |archivedate= 2006-10-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The electric field created by the emitter and the accelerator then accelerates the ions.

{{main|Plasma propulsion engine}}

===Pulsed inductive thrusters===
{{main|Pulsed inductive thruster}}
[[Pulsed inductive thruster]]s (PIT) use pulses instead of continuous thrust and have the ability to run on power levels on the order of megawatts (MW). PITs consist of a large [[electromagnetic coil|coil]] encircling a cone shaped tube that emits the propellant gas. [[Ammonia]] is the gas commonly used. For each pulse, a large charge builds up in a group of capacitors behind the coil and is then released. This creates a current that moves circularly in the direction of jθ. The current then creates a magnetic field in the outward radial direction (Br), which then creates a current in the gas that has just been released in the opposite direction of the original current. This opposite current ionizes the ammonia. The positively charged ions are accelerated away from the engine due to the electric field jθ crossing the magnetic field Br, due to the Lorentz Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2003/CR-2003-212714.pdf|title=Pulsed Inductive Thruster (PIT): Modeling and Validation Using the MACH2 Code|accessdate=2007-11-21|first=Pavlos G.|last=Mikellides|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010033732/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2003/CR-2003-212714.pdf|archivedate=2006-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster===
{{main|Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster}}
[[Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster|Magnetoplasmadynamic]] (MPD) thrusters and lithium Lorentz force accelerator (LiLFA) thrusters use roughly the same idea. The LiLFA thruster builds off of the MPD thruster. [[Hydrogen]], [[argon]], [[ammonia]] and [[nitrogen]] can be used as propellant. In a certain configuration, the ambient gas in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) can be used as a propellant. The gas enters the main chamber where it is ionized into [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] by the electric field between the [[anode]] and the [[cathode]]. This plasma then conducts electricity between the anode and the cathode, closing the circuit. This new current creates a magnetic field around the cathode, which crosses with the electric field, thereby accelerating the plasma due to the Lorentz force.

The LiLFA thruster uses the same general idea as the MPD thruster, with two main differences. First, the LiLFA uses lithium vapor, which can be stored as a solid. The other difference is that the single cathode is replaced by multiple, smaller cathode rods packed into a [[Hollow cathode effect|hollow cathode]] tube. MPD cathodes are easily corroded due to constant contact with the plasma. In the LiLFA thruster the lithium vapor is injected into the hollow cathode and is not ionized to its plasma form/corrode the cathode rods until it exits the tube. The plasma is then accelerated using the same Lorentz Force.&lt;ref name="Sankaran"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alfven.princeton.edu/publications/sankaran-icnta-2003|title=A Survey of Propulsion Options for Cargo and Piloted Missions to Mars|accessdate=2016-10-18|first1=K. |last1=Sankaran |first2= L. |last2= Cassady |first3= A.D. |last3= Kodys |first4= E.Y. |last4= Choueiri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2001/CR-2001-211114.pdf |title=High Power MPD Thruster Development at the NASA Glenn Research Center |accessdate=2007-11-21 |first1=Michael R. |last1=LaPointe |first2=Pavlos G. |last2=Mikellides |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011063710/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2001/CR-2001-211114.pdf |archivedate=October 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/31061/33887503.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Utilization of Ambient Gas as a Propellant for Low Earth Orbit Electric Propulsion |date=May 22, 1999 |first=Buford Ray |last=Conley |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174257/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/31061/33887503.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrodeless plasma thrusters===
{{main|Electrodeless plasma thruster}}
[[Electrodeless plasma thruster]]s have two unique features: the removal of the anode and cathode electrodes and the ability to throttle the engine. The removal of the electrodes eliminates erosion, which limits lifetime on other ion engines. Neutral gas is first ionized by [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] and then transferred to another chamber where it is accelerated by an oscillating electric and magnetic field, also known as the [[ponderomotive force]]. This separation of the ionization and acceleration stages allows throttling of propellant flow, which then changes the thrust magnitude and specific impulse values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elwingcorp.com/files/IEPC05-article.pdf| title= Development of a High Power Electrodeless Thruster|accessdate=2007-11-21|first= Gregory D. |last= Emsellem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helicon double layer thrusters===
{{main|Helicon double-layer thruster}}
A helicon double layer thruster is a type of plasma thruster that ejects high velocity [[ionized]] gas to provide [[thrust]]. In this design, gas is injected into a tubular chamber (the ''source tube'') with one open end. [[Radio frequency]] AC power (at [[ISM band|13.56&amp;nbsp;MHz]] in the prototype design) is coupled into a specially shaped [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] wrapped around the chamber. The [[electromagnetic wave]] emitted by the antenna causes the gas to break down and form a plasma. The antenna then excites a [[helicon (physics)|helicon wave]] in the plasma, which further heats it. The device has a roughly constant [[magnetic field]] in the source tube (supplied by [[solenoids]] in the prototype), but the magnetic field diverges and rapidly decreases in magnitude away from the source region and might be thought of as a kind of magnetic [[nozzle]]. In operation, a sharp boundary separates the high density plasma inside the source region and the low density plasma in the exhaust, which is associated with a sharp change in electrical potential. Plasma properties change rapidly across this boundary, which is known as a ''current-free electric [[double layer (plasma)|double layer]]''. The electrical potential is much higher inside the source region than in the exhaust and this serves both to confine most of the electrons and to accelerate the ions away from the source region. Enough electrons escape the source region to ensure that the plasma in the exhaust is neutral overall.

=== VASIMR ===
{{main|Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket}}

VASIMR, or Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, works by using [[radio waves]] to ionize a [[propellant]] into a plasma and then a [[magnetic field]] to accelerate the plasma out of the back of the [[rocket engine]] to generate thrust. The VASIMR is currently being developed by the private company [[Ad Astra Rocket Company]], headquartered in Houston, TX with of help from Canada-based [[Nautel]], producing the 200&amp;nbsp;kW RF generators for ionizing propellant. Some of the components and "plasma shoots" experiments are tested in a laboratory settled in [[Liberia, Costa Rica]]. This project is led by former NASA astronaut Dr. [[Franklin Chang-Díaz]] (CRC-USA). An 200 kW VASIMR test engine was in discussion to be fitted in the exterior of the [[International Space Station]], as part of the plan to test the VASIMR in space - however plans for this test onboard ISS were canceled in 2015 by NASA, with a free flying VASIMR test being discussed by Ad Astra instead.&lt;ref name="VASiMRscrapped" /&gt; An envisioned 200 megawatt engine could reduce the duration of flight from Earth to Jupiter or Saturn from six years to fourteen months, and Mars from 6 months to 39 days.&lt;ref&gt;Zyga, Lisa (2009).

Under a research grant from the [[Glenn Research Center|NASA Lewis Research Center]] during the 1980s and 1990s, Martin C. Hawley and Jes Asmussen led a team of engineers in developing a Microwave Electrothermal Thruster (MET).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Less Fuel, More Thrust: New Engines are Being Designed for Deep Space| newspaper = The Arugus-Press| location = Owosso, Michigan| pages = 10 | volume= 128 | number= 48 | date = 26 February 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the discharge chamber, [[microwave]] (MW) energy flows into the center containing a high level of [[ion]]s (I), causing neutral species in the gaseous [[Rocket propellant|propellant]] to ionize. Excited species flow out (FES) through the low ion region (II) to a neutral region (III) where the ions complete their [[Plasma recombination|recombination]], replaced with the flow of neutral species (FNS) towards the center.  Meanwhile, energy is lost to the chamber walls through heat [[Thermal conduction|conduction]] and [[Convective heat transfer|convection]] (HCC), along with [[radiation]] (Rad). The remaining energy absorbed into the gaseous propellant is converted into [[thrust]].

==Lifetime==
Ion thrusters' low thrust requires continuous operation for a long time to achieve the necessary change in velocity ([[delta-v]]) for a particular mission. Ion thrusters are designed to provide continuous operation for intervals of weeks to years.

The lifetime of electrostatic ion thrusters is limited by several processes. In electrostatic gridded designs, charge-exchange ions produced by the beam ions with the neutral gas flow can be accelerated towards the negatively biased accelerator grid and cause grid erosion. End-of-life is reached when either the grid structure fails or the holes in the grid become large enough that ion extraction is substantially affected; e.g., by the occurrence of electron backstreaming. Grid erosion cannot be avoided and is the major lifetime-limiting factor. Thorough grid design and material selection enable lifetimes of 20,000 hours or more.

A test of the [[NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness]] (NSTAR) electrostatic ion thruster resulted in 30,472 hours (roughly 3.5 years) of continuous thrust at maximum power. Post-test examination indicated the engine was not approaching failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39521/1/05-2793.pdf|title=Destructive Physical Analysis of Hollow Cathodes from the Deep Space 1 Flight Spare Ion Engine 30,000 Hr Life Test|accessdate=2007-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227050954/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39521/1/05-2793.pdf|archivedate=2009-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Choueiri"/&gt;

The NASA Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) project operated continuously for more than 48,000 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacefellowship.com/news/art34276/nasa-thruster-achieves-world-record-5-years-of-operation.html|title=NASA Thruster Achieves World-Record 5+ Years of Operation|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test was conducted in a high vacuum test chamber. Over the course of the 5 1/2 + year test, the engine consumed approximately 870 kilograms of xenon propellant. The total impulse generated would require over 10,000 kilograms of conventional rocket propellant for a similar application.

The [[Advanced Electric Propulsion System]] (AEPS) is expected to accumulate about 5,000 hr and the design aims to achieve a flight model that offers a half-life of at least 23,000 hours&lt;ref name='AEPS 2017'/&gt; and a full life of about 50,000 hours.&lt;ref name='Rocketdyne 2016'&gt;[http://rocket.com/article/aerojet-rocketdyne-signs-contract-develop-advanced-electric-propulsion-system-nasa Aerojet Rocketdyne Signs Contract to Develop Advanced Electric Propulsion System for NASA]. Aerojet Rocketdyne. Press release, 28 April 2016. Accessed: 27 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 


Hall thrusters suffer from strong erosion of the ceramic discharge chamber by impact of energetic ions: a test reported in 2010&lt;ref name="leipzig"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~iom/muehlleithen/2010/Bundesmann_2010.pdf |title=A closer look at a stationary plasma thruster}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed erosion of around 1&amp;nbsp;mm per hundred hours of operation, though this is inconsistent with observed on-orbit lifetimes of a few thousand hours.

==Propellants==
[[Ionization]] energy represents a large percentage of the energy needed to run ion drives. The ideal propellant is thus easy to ionize and has a high mass/ionization energy ratio. In addition, the propellant should not erode the thruster to any great degree to permit long life; and should not contaminate the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Rocket Propulsion Elements&amp;nbsp;— Sutton &amp; Biblarz 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Many current designs use [[xenon]] gas, as it is easy to ionize, has a reasonably high atomic number, is inert and causes low erosion. However, xenon is globally in short supply and expensive.

Older designs used [[mercury (element)|mercury]], but this is toxic and expensive, tended to contaminate the vehicle with the metal and was difficult to feed accurately. A modern commercial prototype may be using mercury successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Elgin |first1=Ben |title=This Silicon Valley Space Startup Could Lace the Atmosphere With Mercury |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-19/this-space-startup-could-lace-the-atmosphere-with-toxic-mercury |accessdate=19 November 2018 |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other propellants, such as [[bismuth]] and [[iodine]], show promise, particularly for gridless designs, such as Hall effect thrusters.&lt;ref name=Bi-Szabo/&gt;&lt;ref name=I2-Szabo/&gt;&lt;ref name=I2_hp-Szabo/&gt;

[[VASIMR]] design (and other plasma-based engines) are theoretically able to use practically any material for propellant. However, in current tests the most practical propellant is [[argon]], which is relatively abundant and inexpensive.

The CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster (CAT) used on the Mars Array of Ionospheric Research Satellites Using the CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster (MARS-CAT) mission proposes to use solid [[iodine]] as the propellant to minimize storage volume.&lt;ref name="MARS-CAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P4_RF_Thruster"/&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
[[File:Average propulsive efficiency of rockets.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Plot of {{colorbox|#4a86e8}} instantaneous propulsive efficiency and {{colorbox|red}} overall efficiency for a vehicle accelerating from rest as percentages of the engine efficiency. Note that peak vehicle efficiency occurs at about 1.6 times exhaust velocity.]]
Ion thruster efficiency is the kinetic energy of the exhaust jet emitted per second divided by the electrical power into the device.

Overall system energy efficiency is determined by the [[propulsive efficiency]], which depends on vehicle speed and exhaust speed. Some thrusters can vary exhaust speed in operation, but all can be designed with different exhaust speeds. At the lower end of specific impulse, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;, the overall efficiency drops, because ionization takes up a larger percentage energy and at the high end propulsive efficiency is reduced.

Optimal efficiencies and exhaust velocities for any given mission can be calculated to give minimum overall cost.

==Missions==
Ion thrusters have many in-space propulsion applications. The best applications make use of the long mission interval when significant [[thrust]] is not needed. Examples of this include orbit transfers, [[attitude dynamics and control|attitude]] adjustments, [[drag (physics)|drag]] compensation for [[low Earth orbit]]s, fine adjustments for scientific missions and cargo transport between [[propellant depot]]s, e.g., for chemical fuels. Ion thrusters can also be used for interplanetary and deep-space missions where acceleration rates are not crucial. Continuous thrust over a long interval can reach high velocities while consuming far less fuel than traditional chemical rockets.

Among electric thrusters, ion thrusters have received the most serious commercial and academic consideration. Ion thrusters are seen as the best solution for these missions, as they require high change in velocity but do not require rapid acceleration.

===Demonstration vehicles===

====SERT====
Ion propulsion systems were first demonstrated in space by the [[NASA Glenn Research Center|NASA Lewis]] (now Glenn Research Center) missions "[[SERT-1|Space Electric Rocket Test" (SERT)]] I and II.&lt;ref name="Sovey"&gt;{{cite journal| first1= J.

These were [[electrostatic ion thruster]]s using mercury and cesium as the reaction mass. SERT-II, launched on February 3, 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/ion/past/70s/sert2.htm SPACE ELECTRIC ROCKET TEST II (SERT II)], NASA Glenn Research Center.

===Operational missions===
Ion thrusters are routinely used for station-keeping on commercial and military communication satellites in geosynchronous orbit. The Soviet Union pioneered this field, using [[Hall-effect thruster|Stationary Plasma Thruster (SPT)]] thrusters on satellites starting in the early 1970s.

Two geostationary satellites (ESA's [[Artemis (satellite)|Artemis]] in 2001–03&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/esaTE/SEM1LT0P4HD_index_0.html |title=Artemis team receives award for space rescue |accessdate=2006-11-16 |author=ESA |authorlink=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the US military's [[AEHF-1]] in 2010–12&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2012/January%202012/0112space.aspx |title=Rescue in Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;) used the ion thruster to change orbit after the chemical-propellant engine failed. Boeing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1203/19boeing702sp/ |title=Electric propulsion could launch new commercial trend |author=Spaceflight Now}}&lt;/ref&gt; began using ion thrusters for station-keeping in 1997 and planned in 2013–14 to offer a variant on their 702 platform, with no chemical engine and ion thrusters for orbit raising; this permits a significantly lower launch mass for a given satellite capability. [[AEHF-2]] used a chemical engine to raise perigee to 10,150 miles and proceeded to [[geosynchronous orbit]] using electric propulsion.&lt;ref name=aehf2-sfn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/atlas/av031/lae/ |title=AEHF 2 communications satellite keeps on climbing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Earth orbit====

===== GOCE =====

[[ESA]]'s [[Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer]] (GOCE) was launched on March 16, 2009. It used ion propulsion throughout its twenty-month mission to combat the air-drag it experienced in its low orbit (altitude of 255 kilometres) before intentionally deorbiting on November 11, 2013.

====In deep space====

=====''Deep Space 1''=====
[[NASA]] developed the [[NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness|NSTAR]] ion engine for use in interplanetary science missions beginning in the late-1990s. It was space-tested in the highly successful space probe ''[[Deep Space 1]]'', launched in 1998. This was the first use of electric propulsion as the interplanetary propulsion system on a science mission.&lt;ref name="Sovey" /&gt; Based on the NASA design criteria, [[HRL Laboratories|Hughes Research Labs]], developed the Xenon Ion Propulsion System (XIPS) for performing [[orbital station-keeping|station keeping]] on [[geosynchronous satellite]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} [[Hughes Electron Dynamics Division (EDD)|Hughes (EDD)]] manufactured the NSTAR thruster used on the spacecraft.

=====''Hayabusa''=====
The Japanese space agency's [[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|''Hayabusa'']] launched in 2003 and successfully rendezvoused with the asteroid [[25143 Itokawa]] and remained in close proximity for months to collect samples and information. It was powered by four xenon ion engines. Its xenon ions were generated by microwave [[electron cyclotron resonance]] and an erosion-resistant carbon/carbon-composite material for its acceleration grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ep.isas.ac.jp/muses-c/ |title=小惑星探査機はやぶさ搭載イオンエンジン (Ion Engines used on Asteroid Probe Hayabusa) |accessdate=2006-10-13 |author=ISAS |authorlink=Institute of Space and Astronautical Science |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819093452/http://www.ep.isas.ac.jp/muses-c/ |archivedate=2006-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ion engines on ''Hayabusa'' had technical difficulties, in-flight reconfiguration allowed one of the four engines to be repaired and allowed the mission to successfully return to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= Hiroko |last= Tabuchi |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/business/global/02space.html |title= Faulty Space Probe Seen as Test of Japan’s Expertise |newspaper= The New York Times| date= 1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Smart 1''=====
The [[European Space Agency]]'s satellite ''[[SMART-1]]'' launched in 2003 using a Snecma [[PPS-1350]]-G Hall thruster to get from [[geostationary transfer orbit|GTO]] to lunar orbit. This satellite completed its mission on September 3, 2006, in a controlled collision on the [[Moon]]'s surface, after a trajectory deviation so scientists could see the 3 meter crater the impact created on the visible side of the Moon.

===== ''Dawn'' =====
[[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'']] launched on September 27, 2007, to explore the asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] and the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. It used three ''[[Deep Space 1]]'' heritage xenon ion thrusters (firing one at a time). ''Dawn''{{'s}} ion drive is capable of accelerating from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 4 days of continuous firing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features.cfm?feature=1468 The Prius of Space], September 13, 2007, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt; The mission ended on November 1, 2018, when the spacecraft ran out of propellant.&lt;ref name="DawnEOM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-dawn-mission-to-asteroid-belt-comes-to-end|title=NASA's Dawn Mission to Asteroid Belt Comes to End|date=1 November 2018|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== LISA Pathfinder ====

[[LISA Pathfinder]] is an [[ESA]] spacecraft launched in 2015. It does not use ion thrusters as its primary propulsion system, but uses both [[colloid thruster]]s and [[FEEP]] for precise [[attitude control]] — the low thrusts of these propulsion devices make it possible to move the spacecraft incremental distances accurately. It is a test for the possible LISA mission. The mission ended on December 30, 2017.

====BepiColombo====

[[ESA]]'s [[BepiColombo]] mission was launched to [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] on October 20, 2018.&lt;ref name="BepiLaunch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/BepiColombo_s_beginning_ends|title=BepiColombo's beginning ends|date=22 October 2018|access-date=1 November 2018|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses ion thrusters in combination with swing-bys to get to Mercury, where a chemical rocket will complete orbit insertion.

===Planned missions===

====Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway====
The [[Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway]] is proposed to have a module called 'Power and Propulsion Element' (PPE) that will be used to generate electricity for the space station and its ion thruster. It is targeting launch on a commercial vehicle in 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_fy_2019_budget_overview.pdf|title=NASA FY 2019 Budget Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}} Quote: "Supports launch of the Power and PropulsionElement on a commercial launch vehicle as the first component of the LOP - Gateway, (page 14)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spacenews.com/nasa-considers-acquiring-more-than-one-gateway-propulsion-module/ NASA considers acquiring more than one gateway propulsion module].

===Proposed missions===
==== International Space Station ====

{{as of|2011|March}}, a future launch of an Ad Astra VF-200 {{nowrap|200 kW}} [[VASIMR]] electromagnetic thruster was under consideration for testing on the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name="aaESummary20100124"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/EXECUTIVE%20SUMMARY240110.pdf |title=Executive summary |date=January 24, 2010 |publisher=Ad Astra Rocket Company |accessdate=2010-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331171616/http://www.adastrarocket.com/EXECUTIVE%20SUMMARY240110.pdf |archivedate=March 31, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dn20080807"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/08/07/plasma-rocket.html |title=Plasma Rocket May Be Tested at Space Station |date=7 August 2008 |first= Irene |last= Klotz |publisher=Discovery News |accessdate=2010-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2015 NASA ended plans for flying the VF-200 to the ISS. A NASA spokesperson stated that the ISS "was not an ideal demonstration platform for the desired performance level of the engines". Ad Astra stated that tests of a VASIMR thruster on the ISS would remain an option after a future in-space demonstration.&lt;ref name="VASiMRscrapped"&gt;[http://sen.com/blogs/irene-klotz/nasa-nixes-ad-astra-rocket-test-on-the-space-station NASA nixes Ad Astra rocket test on the space station]. ''SEN News'', Irene Klotz. 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The VF-200 would have been a flight version of the [[VX-200]].&lt;ref name="Yahoo News"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/nasa-test-vf-200-vasimr-plasma-rocket-iss-20110310-155100-110.html |title=NASA to Test VF-200 VASIMR Plasma Rocket at the ISS |date=March 10, 2011 |first= Mark |last= Whittington |publisher=Yahoo |accessdate=2012-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytech.com/Commercially+Developed+Plasma+Engine+Soon+To+Be+Tested+In+Space/article12612.htm |title=Commercially Developed Plasma Engine Soon to be Tested in Space |date=August 11, 2008 |first= Jason |last= Mick |publisher=DailyTech |accessdate=2010-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the available power from the ISS is less than 200&amp;nbsp;kW, the ISS VASIMR would have included a trickle-charged battery system allowing for 15 min pulses of thrust. The ISS orbits at a relatively [[low Earth orbit|low altitude]] and experiences fairly high levels of [[atmospheric drag]], requiring [[orbital station-keeping|periodic altitude boosts]] - a high efficiency engine (high specific impulse) for station-keeping would be valuable, theoretically VASIMR reboosting could cut fuel cost from the current $210 million annually to one-twentieth.&lt;ref name="aaESummary20100124" /&gt; VASIMR could in theory use as little as 300&amp;nbsp;kg of argon gas for ISS station-keeping instead of 7.5 tonnes of chemical fuel - the high exhaust velocity (high [[specific impulse]]) would achieve the same acceleration with a smaller amount of propellant, compared to chemical propulsion with its lower exhaust velocity needing more fuel.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17918-rocket-company-tests-worlds-most-powerful-ion-engine/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydrogen]] is generated by the ISS as a by-product and is vented into space.

NASA previously worked on a 50&amp;nbsp;kW ion hall thruster for ISS, but work was stopped in 2005.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

====MARS-CAT ====

The MARS-CAT (Mars Array of ionospheric Research Satellites using the CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster) mission is a two 6U [[CubeSat]] concept mission to study Mars' ionosphere. The mission would investigate its plasma and magnetic structure, including transient plasma structures, magnetic field structure, magnetic activity and correlation with solar wind drivers.&lt;ref name="MARS-CAT" /&gt; The CAT thruster is now called the RF thruster and manufactured by Phase Four.&lt;ref name="P4_RF_Thruster"/&gt;

====Interstellar probe====
[[Geoffrey A. Landis]] proposed to use a space laser source and ion thruster to propel an interstellar probe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13405813666529688188&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5|title=- Google Scholar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geoffreylandis.com/laser_ion.htp Geoffrey A.

== Popular culture ==
The idea of an ion engine first appeared in Donald W Horner's ''By Aeroplane to the Sun: Being the Adventures of a Daring Aviator and his Friends'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ion_drive|title=Themes : Ion Drive : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ion propulsion is the main thrust source of the spaceship ''Kosmokrator'' in the Eastern German/Polish science fiction movie ''[[First Spaceship on Venus|Der Schweigende Stern]]'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kruschel |first1=Karsten |title=Leim für die Venus. Der Science-Fiction-Film in der DDR. |date=2007 |publisher=Heyne Verlag |isbn=3-453-52261-3 |pages=803–888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minute 28:10.

In the 1968 episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', "[[Spock's Brain]]", [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Scotty]] is repeatedly impressed by a civilization's use of ion power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chakoteya.net/StarTrek/61.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tor.com/2016/06/07/star-trek-the-original-series-rewatch-spocks-brain/&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Star Wars]]'' films and literature refer to [[TIE fighter|twin ion engines (TIE) starfighters]].

Ion thrusters appear as the primary form of propulsion in vacuum for the spacecraft in the game ''[[Space Engineers]]''.

They are attested from the [[Medieval Japan|medieval period]], claiming descent from the oldest son of [[Emperor Montoku]], Prince Koretage (844–897), whom they credit with the invention of the wood lathe (rokuro).&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; Originally the ''kijiya'' occupied the more populous parts of central and southern Japan and are said to originate from a single village, Higashi-Ogura, in [[Kanzaki District, Shiga|Kanzaki District]], [[Shiga Prefecture]], leading them to take on the surname, "Ogura". As migrant minority group they moved about in groups of a few families, collecting wood in the mountains. Contact between these groups was achieved through two [[Shinto shrine|shrines]], enshrining the legendary princely ancestor. Shrine officials traveled through the country, collecting contributions and handing out licenses for collecting wood and for pursuing their profession. In 1872, 1536 families were managed by one of these shrines.&lt;ref name="wagatsuma"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wagatsuma|first=Hiroshi|year= 1972|title=Japan's Invisible Race: Caste in Culture and Personality|volume=2|edition=revised|series=Campus (Berkeley, Calif.)

[[File:Phospholipids aqueous solution structures.svg|thumb|right|300px|The three main structures phospholipids form in solution; the [[liposome]] (a closed bilayer), the micelle and the bilayer.]]

The '''lipid bilayer''' (or '''phospholipid bilayer''') is a thin [[polar membrane]] made of two layers of [[lipid]] [[molecule]]s. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all [[cell (biology)|cells]]. The [[cell membrane]]s of almost all [[organisms]] and many [[virus]]es are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the [[nuclear envelope|nuclear membrane]] surrounding the [[cell nucleus]], and other [[biological membrane |membranes]] surrounding  sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps [[ion]]s, [[protein]]s and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role, even though they are only a few [[nanometer]]s in width,&lt;ref name=andersen2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=Olaf S.|last2=Koeppe, II|first2=Roger E.|title=Bilayer Thickness and Membrane Protein Function: An Energetic Perspective|journal=Annual Review of Biophysics and Biomolecular Structure|date=June 2007|volume=36|issue=1|pages=107–130|doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.36.040306.132643|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.biophys.36.040306.132643|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are impermeable to most water-soluble ([[hydrophilic]]) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and [[pH]] by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called [[Ion transporter|ion pumps]].

Biological bilayers are usually composed of [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] [[phospholipid]]s that have a hydrophilic phosphate head and a [[hydrophobic]] tail consisting of two fatty acid chains. Phospholipids with certain head groups can alter the surface chemistry of a bilayer and can, for example, serve as signals as well as "anchors" for other molecules in the membranes of cells.&lt;ref name=Divecha1995&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like the heads, the tails of lipids can also affect membrane properties, for instance by determining the [[Phase (matter)|phase]] of the bilayer. The bilayer can adopt a solid [[gel]] phase state at lower temperatures but undergo [[phase transition]] to a [[Fluids|fluid state]] at higher temperatures, and the chemical properties of the lipids' tails influence at which temperature this happens. The packing of lipids within the bilayer also affects its mechanical properties, including its resistance to stretching and bending. Many of these properties have been studied with the use of artificial "model" bilayers produced in a lab. [[Vesicle (biology)|Vesicles]] made by model bilayers have also been used clinically to deliver drugs.

[[Biological membrane]]s typically include several types of molecules other than phospholipids. A particularly important example in animal cells is [[cholesterol]], which helps strengthen the bilayer and decrease its permeability. Cholesterol also helps regulate the activity of certain [[integral membrane protein]]s. Integral membrane proteins function when incorporated into a lipid bilayer, and they are held tightly to lipid bilayer with the help of an [[annular lipid shell]]. Because bilayers define the boundaries of the cell and its compartments, these membrane proteins are involved in many intra- and inter-cellular signaling processes. Certain kinds of membrane proteins are involved in the process of fusing two bilayers together. This fusion allows the joining of two distinct structures as in the [[fertilization]] of an [[egg (biology)|egg]] by [[sperm]] or the entry of a [[virus]] into a cell.  Because lipid bilayers are quite fragile and invisible in a traditional microscope, they are a challenge to study. Experiments on bilayers often require advanced techniques like [[electron microscopy]] and [[atomic force microscopy]].

==Structure and organization==
When phospholipids are exposed to water, they self-assemble into a two-layered sheet with the hydrophobic tails pointing toward the center of the sheet. This arrangement results in two “leaflets” that are each a single molecular layer.  The center of this bilayer contains almost no water and excludes molecules like [[sugar]]s or salts that dissolve in water. The assembly process is driven by interactions between hydrophobic molecules (also called the [[hydrophobic effect]]).  An increase in interactions between hydrophobic molecules (causing clustering of hydrophobic regions) allows water molecules to bond more freely with each other, increasing the entropy of the system. This complex process includes [[non-covalent interactions]] such as [[van der Waals force]]s, [[electrostatic]] and [[hydrogen bonds]].
[[File:Bilayer hydration profile.svg|left|thumb|310px| Schematic cross sectional profile of a typical lipid bilayer. There are three distinct regions: the fully hydrated headgroups, the fully dehydrated alkane core and a short intermediate region with partial hydration.

===Cross section analysis===
The lipid bilayer is very thin compared to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified to the size of a watermelon (~1&amp;nbsp;ft/30&amp;nbsp;cm), the lipid bilayer making up the [[plasma membrane]] would be about as thick as a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with [[x-ray reflectometry]],&lt;ref name=Lewis1983&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lewis BA, Engelman DM |title=Lipid bilayer thickness varies linearly with acyl chain length in fluid phosphatidylcholine vesicles |journal=J.

The first region on either side of the bilayer is the hydrophilic headgroup. This portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9&amp;nbsp;nm thick. In [[phospholipid]] bilayers the [[phosphate]] group is located within this hydrated region, approximately 0.5&amp;nbsp;nm outside the hydrophobic core.&lt;ref name=Nagle2000&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagle JF, Tristram-Nagle S |title=Structure of lipid bilayers |journal=Biochim.

===Asymmetry===
In many naturally occurring bilayers, the compositions of the inner and outer membrane leaflets are different. In human [[erythrocyte|red blood cells]], the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet is composed mostly of [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylserine]] and [[phosphatidylinositol]] and its phosphorylated derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) leaflet is based on [[phosphatidylcholine]], [[sphingomyelin]] and a variety of glycolipids,&lt;ref name=Bretscher1972&gt;{{cite journal|title=Asymmetrical Lipid Bilayer Structure for Biological Membranes|journal=Nature New Biology|date=1 March 1972|volume=236|issue=61|pages=11–12|doi=10.1038/newbio236011a0|pmid=4502419 |author=Bretscher MS }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Verkleij1973&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Verkleij AJ, Zwaal RF, Roelofsen B, Comfurius P, Kastelijn D, van Deenen LL |title=The asymmetric distribution of phospholipids in the human red cell membrane.

For example, when a cell undergoes [[apoptosis]], the phosphatidylserine&amp;nbsp;— normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet&amp;nbsp;— is transferred to the outer surface: There, it is recognised by a [[macrophage]] that then actively scavenges the dying cell.

Lipid asymmetry arises, at least in part, from the fact that most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called [[flippase]]s.&lt;ref name=Bretscher1973&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.181.4100.622 |author=Bretscher MS |title=Membrane structure: some general principles |journal=Science |volume=181 |issue=4100 |pages=622–629 |date=August 1973 |pmid=4724478 |bibcode = 1973Sci...181..622B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rothman1977&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rothman JE, Kennedy EP |title=Rapid transmembrane movement of newly synthesized phospholipids during membrane assembly |journal=Proc.

Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once lipid asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.&lt;ref name=Kornberg1971&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kornberg RD, McConnell HM |title=Inside-outside transitions of phospholipids in vesicle membranes |journal=Biochemistry |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=1111–20 |date=March 1971 |pmid=4324203 |doi=10.1021/bi00783a003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems.

===Phases and phase transitions===
[[File:Lipid unsaturation effect.svg|right|thumb|350px|Diagram showing the effect of unsaturated lipids on a bilayer. The lipids with an unsaturated tail (blue) disrupt the packing of those with only saturated tails (black). The resulting bilayer has more free space and is, as a consequence, more permeable to water and other small molecules.]]
{{further|Lipid bilayer phase behavior}}

At a given temperature a lipid bilayer can exist in either a liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This [[random walk]] exchange allows lipid to [[diffusion|diffuse]] and thus wander across the surface of the membrane.&lt;ref name=Berg1993&gt;{{cite book |author=Berg, Howard C. |title=Random walks in biology |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=1993 |isbn=0-691-00064-6 |edition=Extended Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility.

The phase behavior of lipid bilayers is determined largely by the strength of the attractive [[van der Waals force|Van der Waals]] interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid.&lt;ref name=Rawicz2000/&gt; Transition temperature can also be affected by the [[degree of unsaturation]] of the lipid tails. An unsaturated [[double bond]] can produce a kink in the [[alkane]] chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains.&lt;ref name=Rawicz2000/&gt; An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.

Most natural membranes are a complex mixture of different lipid molecules. If some of the components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays a critical role in biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase&lt;ref name=Dietrich2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dietrich C, Volovyk ZN, Levi M, Thompson NL, Jacobson K |title=Partitioning of Thy-1, GM1, and cross-linked phospholipid analogs into lipid rafts reconstituted in supported model membrane monolayers |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=98 |issue=19 |pages=10642–7 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11535814 |pmc=58519 |doi=10.1073/pnas.191168698 |bibcode = 2001PNAS...9810642D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is [[cholesterol]], which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.

===Surface chemistry===
While lipid tails primarily modulate bilayer phase behavior, it is the headgroup that determines the bilayer surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of [[phospholipid]]s, but [[sphingolipids]] and [[sterol]]s such as [[cholesterol]] are also important components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|date=2017|publisher=Garland Science|isbn=9781317563747|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIwDwAAQBAJ|language=en|chapter=Chapter 10: Membrane Structures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is [[phosphatidylcholine]] (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells.&lt;ref name=Yeagle1993/&gt; PC is a [[zwitterion]]ic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.

Other headgroups are also present to varying degrees and can include [[phosphatidylserine]] (PS) [[phosphatidylethanolamine]] (PE) and [[phosphatidylglycerol]] (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of [[erythrocyte]]s is a marker of cell [[apoptosis]],&lt;ref name=Fadoka1998&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fadok VA, Bratton DL, Frasch SC, Warner ML, Henson PM |title=The role of phosphatidylserine in recognition of apoptotic cells by phagocytes |journal=Cell Death Differ. |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=551–62 |date=July 1998 |pmid=10200509 |doi=10.1038/sj.cdd.4400404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas PS in [[growth plate]] vesicles is necessary for the [[nucleation]] of [[hydroxyapatite]] crystals and subsequent bone mineralization.&lt;ref name=Anderson2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson HC, Garimella R, Tague SE |title=The role of matrix vesicles in growth plate development and biomineralization |journal=Front.

==Biological roles==
===Containment and separation===
The primary role of the lipid bilayer in biology is to separate [[Aqueous solution|aqueous]] compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier delineating “self” from “non-self,” it is difficult to even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier takes the form of a lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of [[archaea]] that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer.&lt;ref name=Brock2003/&gt; It has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple [[lipid vesicle]] with virtually its sole [[Biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] capability being the production of more [[phospholipid]]s.&lt;ref name=Koch1985&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koch AL |title=Primeval cells: possible energy-generating and cell-division mechanisms |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=270–7 |year=1984 |pmid=6242168 |doi=10.1007/BF02102359 |bibcode=1985JMolE..21..270K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that [[hydrophilic]] molecules cannot easily cross the [[hydrophobic]] bilayer core, as discussed in Transport across the bilayer below. The nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers, while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes). See [[Organelle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://csls-text.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/active/05_01.html 5.1 Cell Membrane Structure | Life Science | University of Tokyo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prokaryote]]s have only one lipid bilayer- the [[cell membrane]] (also known as the plasma membrane). Many prokaryotes also have a [[cell wall]], but the cell wall is composed of [[protein]]s or long chain [[carbohydrate]]s, not lipids. In contrast, [[eukaryote]]s have a range of [[organelle]]s including the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[mitochondria]], [[lysosome]]s and [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. All of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and, together, typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell. In liver [[hepatocyte]]s for example, the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent.&lt;ref name=Alberts2002/&gt;
[[File:7TM4 (GPCR).png|thumb|260px|Illustration of a GPCR signaling protein. In response to a molecule such as a [[hormone]] binding to the exterior domain (blue) the GPCR changes shape and [[catalyzes]] a chemical reaction on the interior domain (red). The gray feature is the surrounding bilayer.]]

===Signaling===
{{see also|Neurotransmission|Lipid raft}}
Probably the most familiar form of cellular signaling is [[synaptic transmission]], whereby a nerve impulse that has reached the end of one [[neuron]] is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of [[neurotransmitter]]s. This transmission is made possible by the action of [[synaptic vesicle]]s loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles [[Lipid bilayer fusion|fuse]] with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.

Lipid bilayers are also involved in signal transduction through their role as the home of [[integral membrane protein]]s. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up to a third of the human [[proteome]] may be membrane proteins.&lt;ref name=Martelli2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martelli PL, Fariselli P, Casadio R |title=An ENSEMBLE machine learning approach for the prediction of all-alpha membrane proteins |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=19 |issue=Suppl 1|pages=i205–11 |year=2003 |pmid=12855459 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12855459 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the [[CD59]] protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The [[HIV]] virus evades the [[immune system]] in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface.&lt;ref name=Alberts2002&gt;{{cite book |author=Alberts, Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York |year=2002 |edition=4th |isbn=0-8153-4072-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate all the way through the bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the [[G protein-coupled receptor]] (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings and, because of this important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.&lt;ref name=Filmore2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Filmore D |title=It's A GPCR World |journal=Modern Drug Discovery |volume=11 |pages=24–9 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to protein- and solution-mediated processes, it is also possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling. A classic example of this is [[phosphatidylserine]]-triggered [[phagocytosis]]. Normally, phosphatidylserine is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only on the interior side. During programmed cell death a protein called a [[scramblase]] equilibrates this distribution, displaying phosphatidylserine on the extracellular bilayer face. The presence of phosphatidylserine then triggers phagocytosis to remove the dead or dying cell.

The lipid bilayer is a very difficult structure to study because it is so thin and fragile. In spite of these limitations dozens of techniques have been developed over the last seventy years to allow investigations of its structure and function.

Electrical measurements are a straightforward way to characterize an important function of a bilayer: its ability to segregate and prevent the flow of ions in solution. By applying a voltage across the bilayer and measuring the resulting current, the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the bilayer is determined. This resistance is typically quite high (10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Ohm-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or more) &lt;ref name=Montal1972&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montal M, Mueller P |title=Formation of bimolecular membranes from lipid monolayers and a study of their electrical properties |journal=Proc.

Electrical measurements do not provide an actual picture like imaging with a microscope can. Lipid bilayers cannot be seen in a traditional microscope because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use [[fluorescence microscopy]]. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength, so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer.

[[Electron microscopy]] offers a higher resolution image. In an [[electron microscope]], a beam of focused [[electron]]s interacts with the sample rather than a beam of light as in traditional microscopy. In conjunction with rapid freezing techniques, electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport, for instance in demonstrating that [[Exocytosis|exocytotic]] vesicles are the means of chemical release at [[synapse]]s.&lt;ref name=Heuser1979&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heuser JE, Reese TS, Dennis MJ, Jan Y, Jan L, Evans L |title=Synaptic vesicle exocytosis captured by quick freezing and correlated with quantal transmitter release |journal=J.

&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-NMR(nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy is widely used for studies of phospholipid bilayers and biological membranes in native conditions. The analysis&lt;ref name=Dubinnyi&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dubinnyi MA, Lesovoy DM, Dubovskii PV, Chupin VV, Arseniev AS |title=Modeling of &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-NMR spectra of magnetically oriented phospholipid liposomes: A new analytical solution |journal=Solid State Nucl Magn Reson. |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=305–311 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16298110 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6THK-4HKCYVB-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F2006&amp;_rdoc=9&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_origin=browse&amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235285%232006%23999709995%23614865%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=5285&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=15&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=5d39b757c9976ffdf5d9318ae4e5f217&amp;searchtype=a |doi=10.1016/j.ssnmr.2005.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-NMR spectra of lipids could provide a wide range of information about lipid bilayer packing, phase transitions (gel phase, physiological liquid crystal phase, ripple phases, non bilayer phases), lipid head group orientation/dynamics, and elastic properties of pure lipid bilayer and as a result of binding of proteins and other biomolecules.

A new method to study lipid bilayers is [[Atomic force microscopy]] (AFM). Rather than using a beam of light or particles, a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because it has the potential to image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes)&lt;ref name=Lipid_and_nanoparticles&gt;Y. Roiter, M.

Lipid bilayers exhibit high levels of [[birefringence]] where the refractive index in the plane of the bilayer differs from that perpendicular by as much as 0.1 [[refractive index]] units. This has been used to characterise the degree of order and disruption in bilayers using [[dual polarisation interferometry]] to understand mechanisms of protein interaction.

Lipid bilayers are complicated molecular systems with many degrees of freedom. Thus atomistic simulation of membrane and in particular [[ab initio]] calculations of its properties is difficult and computationally expensive. Quantum chemical calculations has recently been successfully performed to estimate [[dipole]] and [[quadrupole]] moments of lipid membranes.&lt;ref&gt;Alireza Mashaghi et al., Hydration strongly affects the molecular and electronic structure of membrane phospholipids.

==Transport across the bilayer==
===Passive diffusion===
Most [[Chemical polarity|polar]] molecules have low solubility in the [[hydrocarbon]] core of a lipid bilayer and, as a consequence, have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer. This effect is particularly pronounced for charged species, which have even lower permeability coefficients than neutral polar molecules.&lt;ref name=Chakrabarti1994&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chakrabarti AC |title=Permeability of membranes to amino acids and modified amino acids: mechanisms involved in translocation |journal=Amino Acids |volume=6 |issue= 3|pages=213–29 |year=1994 |pmid=11543596 |doi=10.1007/BF00813743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anion]]s typically have a higher rate of diffusion through bilayers than [[cation]]s.&lt;ref name=Hauser1972&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hauser H, Phillips MC, Stubbs M |title=Ion permeability of phospholipid bilayers |journal=Nature |volume=239 |issue=5371 |pages=342–4 |date=October 1972 |pmid=12635233 |doi=10.1038/239342a0 |bibcode = 1972Natur.239..342H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Papahadjopoulos1967&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Papahadjopoulos D, Watkins JC |title=Phospholipid model membranes.

When a cell or vesicle with a high interior salt concentration is placed in a solution with a low salt concentration it will swell and eventually burst. Such a result would not be observed unless water was able to pass through the bilayer with relative ease. The anomalously large permeability of water through bilayers is still not completely understood and continues to be the subject of active debate.&lt;ref name=Paula1996&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paula S, Volkov AG, Van Hoek AN, Haines TH, Deamer DW |title=Permeation of protons, potassium ions, and small polar molecules through phospholipid bilayers as a function of membrane thickness |journal=Biophys.

===Ion pumps and channels===
Two special classes of protein deal with the ionic gradients found across cellular and sub-cellular membranes in nature- [[ion channel]]s and [[Ion transporter|ion pumps]]. Both pumps and channels are [[integral membrane protein]]s that pass through the bilayer, but their roles are quite different. Ion pumps are the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external energy source to move ions against the concentration gradient to an area of higher [[chemical potential]]. The energy source can be [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], as is the case for the [[NaKATPase|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase]]. Alternatively, the energy source can be another chemical gradient already in place, as in the [[Sodium-calcium exchanger|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporter]]. It is through the action of ion pumps that cells are able to regulate [[pH]] via the [[Proton pump|pumping of protons]].

In contrast to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate them in order to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the [[Sodium channel|voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel]], which allows conduction of an [[action potential]] along [[neuron]]s. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.&lt;ref name=Gouaux2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gouaux E, Mackinnon R |title=Principles of selective ion transport in channels and pumps |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5753 |pages=1461–5 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16322449 |doi=10.1126/science.1113666 |bibcode = 2005Sci...310.1461G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pinocytosis.svg|right|210px|thumb|Schematic illustration of pinocytosis, a type of endocytosis]]

===Endocytosis and exocytosis===
{{see also|Endocytosis|Exocytosis}}
Some molecules or particles are too large or too hydrophilic to pass through a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through [[Lipid bilayer fusion|fusion]] or budding of [[Lipid vesicle|vesicles]]. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing a portion of the extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the sheer volume of lipid material involved.&lt;ref name=Gundelfinger2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gundelfinger ED, Kessels MM, Qualmann B |title=Temporal and spatial coordination of exocytosis and endocytosis |journal=Nat.

===Electroporation===
{{further|Electroporation}}
Electroporation is the rapid increase in bilayer permeability induced by the application of a large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as [[DNA]], which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core.&lt;ref name=Neumann1982&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Neumann E, Schaefer-Ridder M, Wang Y, Hofschneider PH |title=Gene transfer into mouse lyoma cells by electroporation in high electric fields |journal=EMBO J. |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=841–5 |year=1982 |pmid=6329708 |pmc=553119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, electroporation is one of the key methods of [[transfection]] as well as bacterial [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]]. It has even been proposed that electroporation resulting from [[lightning]] strikes could be a mechanism of natural [[horizontal gene transfer]].&lt;ref name="Demanèche2001"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Demanèche S, Bertolla F, Buret F, etal |title=Laboratory-scale evidence for lightning-mediated gene transfer in soil |journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol. |volume=67 |issue=8 |pages=3440–4 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11472916 |pmc=93040 |doi=10.1128/AEM.67.8.3440-3444.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This increase in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species, indicating that the mechanism is the creation of nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although electroporation and [[dielectric breakdown]] both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.

Lipid bilayers are large enough structures to have some of the mechanical properties of liquids or solids. The area compression modulus K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, bending modulus K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, and edge energy &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;, can be used to describe them. Solid lipid bilayers also have a [[shear modulus]], but like any liquid, the shear modulus is zero for fluid bilayers. These mechanical properties affect how the membrane functions. K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer,&lt;ref name=Garcia2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garcia ML |title=Ion channels: gate expectations |journal=Nature |volume=430 |issue=6996 |pages=153–5 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15241399 |doi=10.1038/430153a |bibcode = 2004Natur.430..153G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McIntosh2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McIntosh TJ, Simon SA |title=Roles of Bilayer Material Properties in Function and Distribution of Membrane Proteins |journal=Annu.

As discussed in the Structure and organization section, the hydrophobic attraction of lipid tails in water is the primary force holding lipid bilayers together. Thus, the elastic modulus of the bilayer is primarily determined by how much extra area is exposed to water when the lipid molecules are stretched apart.&lt;ref name=Boal2002&gt;{{cite book |author=Boal, David H. |title=Mechanics of the cell |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-521-79681-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not surprising given this understanding of the forces involved that studies have shown that K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; varies strongly with [[osmotic pressure]]&lt;ref name=Rutkowski1991&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rutkowski CA, Williams LM, Haines TH, Cummins HZ |title=The elasticity of synthetic phospholipid vesicles obtained by photon correlation spectroscopy |journal=Biochemistry |volume=30 |issue=23 |pages=5688–96 |date=June 1991 |pmid=2043611 |doi=10.1021/bi00237a008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  but only weakly with tail length and unsaturation.&lt;ref name="Rawicz2000"/&gt; Because the forces involved are so small, it is difficult to experimentally determine K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.

In contrast to K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is a measure of how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as [[micelle]]s or inverted micelles. Addition of ''small hydrophilic molecules'' like ''sucrose'' into mixed lipid ''lamellar liposomes'' made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into '''micellar''' phase.&lt;ref&gt;YashRoy R.C. (1994) Destabilisation of lamellar dispersion of ''thylakoid'' membrane lipids by sucrose.

&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of how much energy it takes to expose a bilayer edge to water by tearing the bilayer or creating a hole in it. The origin of this energy is the fact that creating such an interface exposes some of the lipid tails to water, but the exact orientation of these border lipids is unknown. There is some evidence that both hydrophobic (tails straight) and hydrophilic (heads curved around) pores can coexist.&lt;ref name=Weaver1996&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weaver JC, Chizmadzhev YA |title=Theory of electroporation: A review |journal=Biochemistry and Bioenergetics |volume=41 |issue= 2|pages=135–60 |year=1996 |doi=10.1016/S0302-4598(96)05062-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fusion==
{{see also|Lipid bilayer fusion|Interbilayer forces in membrane fusion}}
[[File:Lipid bilayer fusion.svg|right|thumb|280px| Illustration of lipid vesicles fusing showing two possible outcomes: hemifusion and full fusion. In hemifusion, only the outer bilayer leaflets mix. In full fusion both leaflets as well as the internal contents mix.]]
[[Lipid bilayer fusion|Fusion]] is the process by which two lipid bilayers merge, resulting in one connected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, a water-filled bridge is formed and the solutions contained by the bilayers can mix. Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, in particular in [[eukaryote]]s, since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. [[Exocytosis]], [[fertilization]] of an [[egg (biology)|egg]] by [[sperm]] and transport of waste products to the [[lysozome]] are a few of the many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated [[virus]]es have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.

There are four fundamental steps in the fusion process.&lt;ref name=Yeagle1993/&gt; First, the involved membranes must aggregate, approaching each other to within several nanometers. Second, the two bilayers must come into very close contact (within a few angstroms). To achieve this close contact, the two surfaces must become at least partially dehydrated, as the bound surface water normally present causes bilayers to strongly repel. The presence of ions, in particular divalent cations like magnesium and calcium, strongly affects this step.&lt;ref name=Papahadjopoulos1990&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Papahadjopoulos D, Nir S, Düzgünes N |title=Molecular mechanisms of calcium-induced membrane fusion |journal=J.

Third, a destabilization must form at one point between the two bilayers, locally distorting their structures. The exact nature of this distortion is not known. One theory is that a highly curved "stalk" must form between the two bilayers.&lt;ref name=Markin1984&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Markin VS, Kozlov MM, Borovjagin VL |title=On the theory of membrane fusion.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The situation is further complicated when considering fusion ''in vivo'' since biological fusion is almost always regulated by the action of [[Membrane protein|membrane-associated proteins]]. The first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins, which allow an enveloped [[virus]] to insert its genetic material into the host cell (enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer; some others have only a protein coat). [[Eukaryotic]] cells also use fusion proteins, the best-studied of which are the [[SNARE (protein)|SNAREs]]. SNARE proteins are used to direct all [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicular]] intracellular trafficking. Despite years of study, much is still unknown about the function of this protein class. In fact, there is still an active debate regarding whether SNAREs are linked to early docking or participate later in the fusion process by facilitating hemifusion.&lt;ref name=Chen2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen YA, Scheller RH |title=SNARE-mediated membrane fusion |journal=Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=98–106 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11252968 |doi=10.1038/35052017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studies of molecular and cellular biology it is often desirable to artificially induce fusion. The addition of [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption. This procedure is now used extensively, for example by fusing [[B-cell]]s with [[myeloma]] cells.&lt;ref name=Kohler1975&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Köhler G, Milstein C |title=Continuous cultures of fused cells secreting antibody of predefined specificity |journal=Nature |volume=256 |issue=5517 |pages=495–7 |date=August 1975 |pmid=1172191 |doi=10.1038/256495a0 |bibcode=1975Natur.256..495K}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting “[[hybridoma]]” from this combination expresses a desired [[antibody]] as determined by the B-cell involved, but is immortalized due to the melanoma component. Fusion can also be artificially induced through [[electroporation]] in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the [[Lipid bilayer mechanics|energetically active edges]] formed during electroporation, which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers.&lt;ref name=Jordan1989&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jordan, Carol A. |author2=Neumann, Eberhard |author3=Sowershi mason, Arthur E. |title=Electroporation and electrofusion in cell biology |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |year=1989 |isbn=0-306-43043-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model systems==
{{further|Model lipid bilayers}}
Lipid bilayers can be created artificially in the lab to allow researchers to perform experiments that cannot be done with natural bilayers. They can also be used in the field of [[Synthetic biology|Synthetic Biology]], to define the boundaries of [[artificial cell]]s. These synthetic systems are called model lipid bilayers. There are many different types of model bilayers, each having experimental advantages and disadvantages. They can be made with either synthetic or natural lipids. Among the most common model systems are:

* [[Model lipid bilayers#Black lipid membranes (BLM)|Black lipid membranes (BLM)]]
* [[Model lipid bilayers#Supported lipid bilayers (SLB)|Supported lipid bilayers (SLB)]]
* [[Model lipid bilayers#Tethered Bilayer Lipid Membranes (t-BLM)|Tethered Bilayer Lipid Membranes (t-BLM)]]
* [[Model lipid bilayers#Vesicles|Vesicles]]
* [[Model lipid bilayer|Droplet Interface Bilayers (DIBs)]]

==Commercial applications==
To date, the most successful commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of [[liposome]]s for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “[[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the target site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for [[Metabolize|degrading]] lipids.&lt;ref name=Immordino2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Immordino ML, Dosio F, Cattel L |title=Stealth liposomes: review of the basic science, rationale, and clinical applications, existing and potential |journal=Int J Nanomed |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=297–315 |year=2006 |pmid=17717971 |pmc=2426795 |doi=10.2217/17435889.1.3.297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both [[renal]] clearing and [[phagocytosis]]. Refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity, surface charge density, and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from [[blood serum|serum]] and thus are less readily recognized by the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=Chonn1992&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chonn A, Semple SC, Cullis PR |title=Association of blood proteins with large unilamellar liposomes in vivo. Relation to circulation lifetimes |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=267 |issue=26 |pages=18759–65 |date=15 September 1992|pmid=1527006 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1527006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) onto the liposome surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.&lt;ref name=Boris1997&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boris EH, Winterhalter M, Frederik PM, Vallner JJ, Lasic DD |title=Stealth liposomes: from theory to product |journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews |volume=24 |issue= 2–3|pages=165–77 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0169-409X(96)00456-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stealth liposomes were passively targeted at [[tumor]] tissues. Because tumors induce rapid and uncontrolled [[angiogenesis]] they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes to exit the bloodstream at a much higher rate than normal tissue would.&lt;ref name=Maeda2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maeda H, Sawa T, Konno T |title=Mechanism of tumor-targeted delivery of macromolecular drugs, including the EPR effect in solid tumor and clinical overview of the prototype polymeric drug SMANCS |journal=J Control Release |volume=74 |issue=1–3 |pages=47–61 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11489482 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168365901003091 |doi=10.1016/S0168-3659(01)00309-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently{{when|date=January 2011}} work has been undertaken to graft [[antibodies]] or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type.&lt;ref name=Lopes1999&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lopes DE, Menezes DE, Kirchmeier MJ, Gagne JF |title=Cellular trafficking and cytotoxicity of anti-CD19-targeted liposomal doxorubicin in B lymphoma cells |journal=Journal of Liposome Research |volume=9 |issue= 2|pages=199–228 |year=1999 |doi=10.3109/08982109909024786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of this approach are already in clinical trials.&lt;ref name=Matsumura2004&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Matsumura Y, Gotoh M, Muro K, etal |title=Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of MCC-465, a doxorubicin (DXR) encapsulated in PEG immunoliposome, in patients with metastatic stomach cancer |journal=Ann.

Another potential application of lipid bilayers is the field of [[biosensor]]s. Since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, it is also the site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics&lt;ref name="Biacore"&gt;[http://www.gelifesciences.com/biacore]. Biacore Inc. Retrieved Feb 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and Nanion Inc., which has developed an [[Planar patch clamp|automated patch clamping]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanion.de/pdf/PlanarPatchClamping.pdf Nanion Technologies. Automated Patch Clamp]. Retrieved Feb 28, 2010. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued such as the use of lipid bilayer membrane pores for [[DNA sequencing]] by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.

A supported lipid bilayer (SLB) as described above has achieved commercial success as a screening technique to measure the permeability of drugs. This '''p'''arallel '''a'''rtificial '''m'''embrane '''p'''ermeability '''a'''ssay [[PAMPA]] technique measures the permeability across specifically formulated lipid cocktail(s) found to be highly correlated with [[Caco-2]] cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Bermejo, M. et al.

==History==
{{further|History of cell membrane theory}}
By the early twentieth century scientists had come to believe that cells are surrounded by a thin oil-like barrier,&lt;ref name=Loeb1904&gt;{{cite journal |author=Loeb J |title=The recent development of Biology |journal=Science |volume=20 |issue=519 |pages=777–786 |date=December 1904 |pmid=17730464 |doi=10.1126/science.20.519.777 |bibcode = 1904Sci....20..777L }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the structural nature of this membrane was not known. Two experiments in 1925 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the [[capacitance]] of [[erythrocyte]] solutions, Hugo Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3&amp;nbsp;nm thick.&lt;ref name=Fricke1925&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fricke H |title=The electrical capacity of suspensions with special reference to blood |journal=Journal of General Physiology |volume=9 |issue= 2|pages=137–52 |year=1925 |pmid=19872238 |pmc=2140799 |doi=10.1085/jgp.9.2.137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the results of this experiment were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter&lt;ref name=Gorterbio&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dooren LJ, Wiedemann LR |title=On bimolecular layers of lipids on the chromocytes of the blood |journal=Journal of European Journal of Pediatrics |volume=145 |issue=5 |page=329 |year=1986 |doi=10.1007/BF00439232}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a [[Langmuir-Blodgett trough]]. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one.&lt;ref name=Gorter1925&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gorter E, Grendel F |title=On bimolecular layers of lipids on the chromocytes of the blood |journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=41 |issue= 4|pages=439–43 |year=1925 |pmid=19868999 |pmc=2130960 |doi=10.1084/jem.41.4.439}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.&lt;ref name=Yeagle1993&gt;{{cite book |author=Yeagle, Philip |title=The membranes of cells |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1993 |edition=2nd |isbn=0-12-769041-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory was confirmed through the use of [[electron microscopy]] in the late 1950s. Although he did not publish the first electron microscopy study of lipid bilayers&lt;ref name="Sjöstrand1958"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sjöstrand FS, Andersson-Cedergren E, Dewey MM |title=The ultrastructure of the intercalated discs of frog, mouse and guinea pig cardiac muscle |journal=J. Ultrastruct. Res. |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=271–87 |date=April 1958 |pmid=13550367 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5320(58)80008-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; J. David Robertson was the first to assert that the two dark electron-dense bands were the headgroups and associated proteins of two apposed lipid monolayers.&lt;ref name=Robertson1960&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robertson JD |title=The molecular structure and contact relationships of cell membranes |journal=Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. |volume=10 |issue= |pages=343–418 |year=1960 |pmid=13742209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robertson1959&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robertson JD |title=The ultrastructure of cell membranes and their derivatives |journal=Biochem. Soc. Symp. |volume=16 |issue= |pages=3–43 |year=1959 |pmid=13651159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this body of work, Robertson put forward the concept of the “unit membrane.” This was the first time the bilayer structure had been universally assigned to all cell membranes as well as [[organelle]] membranes.

Around the same time, the development of model membranes confirmed that the lipid bilayer is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins. By “painting” a solution of lipid in organic solvent across an aperture, Mueller and Rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity, high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture,&lt;ref name=Mueller1962&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mueller P, Rudin DO, Tien HT, Wescott WC |title=Reconstitution of cell membrane structure in vitro and its transformation into an excitable system |journal=Nature |volume=194 |issue= 4832|pages=979–80 |date=June 1962 |pmid=14476933 |doi=10.1038/194979a0 |bibcode = 1962Natur.194..979M }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane. A few years later, [[Alec Douglas Bangham|Alec Bangham]] showed that bilayers, in the form of lipid vesicles, could also be formed simply by exposing a dried lipid sample to water.&lt;ref name=Bangham1964&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an important advance, since it demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via [[self assembly]] and do not require a patterned support structure.

In 1977, a totally synthetic bilayer membrane was prepared by Kunitake and Okahata, from a single organic compound, didodecyldimethylammonium bromide.&lt;ref name=Kunitake1977&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kunitake T |title=A totally synthetic bilayer membrane |journal=J.

'''''Lloyd in Space''''' is an American [[animated television series]], created by [[Joe Ansolabehere]] and [[Paul Germain]] (previous creators of ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]''), and premiered in 2001 on ABC-TV on Saturday mornings.&lt;ref name=bcdb&gt;"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Walt_Disney_Studios/Television/Disney_s_Lloyd_In_Space/ Lloyd In Space]". ''www.bcdb.com'', May 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot was written by Ansolabehere, Germain and Mark Drop. The characters were designed by Eric Keyes. Reruns have aired on ''[[Toon Disney]]'' until 2006, when it was replaced by ''[[The Emperor's New School]]''.

==Premise==
Living far in the future, shortly after the end of World War IX, Lloyd Nebulon is a green-skinned alien (of the Verdigrean race) with pointy ears and a single [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] sticking from his head. Lloyd lives in the Intrepidville Space Station along with his [[telekinetic]] and [[telepathic]] little sister Francine and his mother, Commander Norah Li Nebulon, the Head of Intrepidville. Lloyd's friends are Eddie R. Horton (a red-haired teenage human), Kurt Blobberts (an enormous purple blob with a single eyeball and simple intelligence, of a species known as the Blobullons), and Douglas McNoggin (a giant brain with limbs and a face, of a species known as the Cerebellians).

==Production==

===Early success===
''Lloyd in Space'' was first introduced in early 2001 during Disney's One Saturday Morning on ABC. The show received higher ratings than initially expected, prompting Disney to quickly order additional episodes (some of which would air in the second season).

===Cancellation===
''Lloyd in Space'' finished production in 2003, after the ''One Saturday Morning'' block was removed. The final episodes aired in February 2004.

== Episodes ==
{{Main article|List of Lloyd in Space episodes}}

== Characters ==
=== Main characters ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[David Kaufman]] --&gt;
* '''Lloyd P. Nebulon''' (voiced by [[Courtland Mead]]) is an average 13-year-old boy of the Verdigrean species. Despite being a friendly, well-meaning character and his mother's leadership over Intrepidville, he and his group are considered the "dorks" of their class at Luna Vista Middle School and, in many of the school-related episodes, are often subjected to embarrassing circumstances against their will or intention. Such instances involve or result in teasing and disrespect at the hands of their shallow classmates of the more socially-powerful circle. Lloyd has a crush on his classmate Brittany Boviak, the popular yet conceited head cheerleader who (despite often verbally and emotionally abusing Lloyd) secretly reciprocates his feelings.
* '''Commander Nora Li Nebulon''' (voiced by [[April Winchell]]) is the commander of Intrepidville and Lloyd's single mother. She is strict, loving, kind and caring. Lloyd's father never appeared in the series.
* '''Francine Nebulon''' (voiced by Nicolette Little) is Lloyd's younger sister. She loves her doll Rosie, and loves to use her telekinesis and telepathy, especially to tease her big brother Lloyd. Her favorite TV show is The Daisy Droid Girls (a parody of [[The Powerpuff Girls]]).
* '''Station''' (voiced by [[Brian George]]) is the space station's computer. When activated, he assumes the form of an eyeball attached to a long wire leading from any computer terminal. Station has a tendency to be fairly anxious and distant to those around him.
* '''Edward R. "Eddie" Horton''' (voiced by [[Justin Shenkarow]]) is Lloyd's human best friend. He has wavy orange hair and tries to act in a "cool" manner. His father is a police officer.  
* '''Douglas McNoggin''' (voiced by [[Pamela Hayden]]) is a member of the Cerebellian species who resembles a brain with glasses, arms, and legs and one of Lloyd's friends. While he is the most intelligent character in the show, he is also the least athletic.
* '''Kurt Blobberts''' (voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]]) is Lloyd's large, one-eyed friend of the Blobullon species. While sometimes dim-witted, Kurt is a caring and generous boy, but is usually treated the same as the rest of his group of friends. His head can be removed from his body and still function.

=== Villains ===
* '''The Zeptar's Bandit''' (voiced by [[Danny Cooksey]]) is a lowly criminal. He robs Zeptar's (a local eatery) before he is caught by the police.
* '''Frontok''' (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is a space-pirate who holds Lloyd and his friends hostage. He is eventually thwarted by Commander Nebulon, Lloyd's mother.
* '''The Pick-pocket''' is a criminal that appears in Eddie's memory in the final episode of the show. He is caught by Eddie's dad.
* '''Kurtlas''' is the fusion between Douglas and Kurt due to Lloyd's suggestion. At first Kurtlas defends the weaker and smaller kids at school from Rodney and the other bullies but all this fame goes to his head and becomes the school bully himself. He is stopped by Lloyd in the end.
* '''The Preditalien''' is a monster which attacks and infects Intrepidville from the year X27 to X37. If one scratched or bit another life form they too would become monsters. In the episode the preditalien appears, it is merely an illusion created by Francine to scare Lloyd and his friends, provided by Boomer's comics.

=== Supporting characters ===
* '''Dunkirque''' (voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]) is second-in-command of the space station. He is a tough and obedient prominent aide to Commander Nebulon.
* '''Larry''' (voiced by [[Eddie Deezen]]) is the other one of Commander Nebulon's prominent aides. He is a purple humanoid who frequently acts childishly.
* '''Boomer''' (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]) is the mechanic who repairs all the spacecrafts on Intrepidville. He is fairly simple-minded. It is revealed in "Boomer's Secret Life" that he is the heir to his race's throne, but he turned his title over to his brother Sleeveknot.
* '''Lou 2000''' (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) is Station's bad-mouthed backup system. When in use, he frequently picks on Larry.
* '''Brittany Boviak''' (voiced by [[Anndi McAfee]]) is a rich, six-armed Tsktskian girl who is the captain of the [[cheerleading]] squad. She is also revealed later in the series to have a secret crush on Lloyd. Although she secretly likes Lloyd, she verbally and emotionally abuses him, giving the impression that he is not worthy of her time.
* '''Megan Uno''' (voiced by Rachel Crane) is Brittany's best friend with a single eyestalk. She is usually with Brittany wherever she goes, and most of the time she is slightly more sour than Brittany herself and surprisingly more shallow in terms of boys.
* '''Cindy''' is a girl with two heads: One head is nice, polite, and charming, and the other head tends to be cruel, impolite, and abusive. Cindy is arguably one of the few recurring students to be a friend to Lloyd's group. Her good head is voiced by [[Tara Strong]], while her bad head is voiced by [[Mayim Bialik]].
* '''Eileen''' (voiced by [[Michelle Horn]]) is a girl who has three eyes and four tentacles on the lower half of her body instead of arms and legs.
* '''Rodney Glaxer''' (voiced by Warren Sroka) is the four-armed [[school bully]] who is also the captain of the Luna Vista [[football|Crush Ball]] team. He favors picking on [[nerd]]s, particularly Mendel, though he has no general qualm or limit when it comes to making trouble for those who are smaller, weaker, or even lack the confidence to stand up to him. Towards the end of the series, Rodney is revealed to be the reason for Lloyd's low standing in the popularity social scale, as he tripped Lloyd in 1st grade when he was a new student, causing him to stumble and fall on Brittany's finger-painted picture getting him laughed at by the rest of class and resulting in Brittany's typical grief of him in the future.
* '''Mendel''' (voiced by [[Blake McIver Ewing]]) is one of the nerds at Luna Vista and the main target of Rodney's bullying. He often hangs out with his nerd friends such as Lou and Benny, as well as other usually unpopular kids.
* '''Mrs. Barbara Bolt''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) is Lloyd's [[teacher]] at Luna Vista Middle School. She is a cranky robot who gets very uptight when Lloyd or any other student is messing around.
* '''Mr. Stinko''' (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is the garbage man of Intrepidville.
* '''Charmaine''' is a female Cerebellian. She is seen as a very intelligent character, and often is involved in debates against other schools, often with partner Douglas. She is friends with Douglas, Cindy and Missy.
* '''Missy''' is a Blobullon who resembles Kurt in many ways, she has one eye and purple skin. However, she is slightly smaller than Kurt. She and Kurt seem to like each other as shown in "Double Date," he compliments her saying she is "neat." She is friends with Cindy, Charmaine and Kurt.
* '''Grandpa Leo''' (voiced by [[Brian Doyle Murray]]) is the grandfather of Lloyd and Francine and the father of Nora. He is the closest thing to a father figure Lloyd has.
* '''Jake''' is one of Rodney's friends. Jake, like Rodney, is also a bully and one of the Crater Worm jocks on the school's Crush Ball team.
* '''Marcus Xenon''' is another one of Rodney's friends who is also a bully. Marcus, like Eileen, is a green, three-eyed, [[octopus]]-like alien, only without hair and having a more frequent tendency to moving bipedal.
* '''Violet''' (voiced by [[Ashley Johnson]]) is a girl who is friends with Brittany and Megan. Violet tends to be more shy than the other girls of her class and she even reveals in the season 2 finale that she has a crush on Lloyd, though this was never mentioned again afterwards. According to this same episode, she is president of the school yearbook staff.

The '''meniscus''' (plural: ''menisci'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "[[Crescent (disambiguation)|crescent]]") is the curve in the upper surface of a [[liquid]] close to the surface of the container or another object, caused by [[surface tension]]. It can be either [[convex set|concave or convex]], depending on the liquid and the surface.

A concave meniscus occurs when the particles of the liquid are more strongly attracted to the container ([[adhesion]]) than to each other ([[cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]]), causing the liquid to climb the walls of the container. This occurs between water and glass.  Water-based fluids like sap, honey, and milk also have a concave meniscus in glass or other [[wetting|wettable]] containers.

Conversely, a convex meniscus occurs when the particles in the liquid have a stronger attraction to each other than to the material of the container.&lt;ref name=moore290&gt;{{cite book | last = Moore | first = John W. | last2 = Stanitski | first2 = Conrad L. | last3 = Jurs | first3 = Peter C. | title = Chemistry: The Molecular Science | location = Belmont, CA | publisher = Brooks/Cole | year = 2005 | page = 290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convex menisci occur, for example, between [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[glass]] in barometers&lt;ref name=moore290/&gt; and thermometers.

==Contact angle and surface tension==
[[File:Dynamic contact angle Attension Sigma.png|alt=Menisci on a thin fiber.|left|thumb|Menisci on a thin fiber.]]
The formation of menisci is commonly used in surface science to measure [[Contact angle|contact angles]] and [[surface tension]]. In a contact angle measurement, the shape of the menisci is measured with a balance or optically with a digital camera. In a surface tension measurement, the measurement probe has a contact angle of zero and the surface tension can be obtained by measuring the mass of the menisci. This is typically done with a [[Wilhelmy plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content.biolinscientific.com/surface-and-interfacial-tension|title=Surface and interfacial tension {{!}} White Paper|last=Biolin Scientific|first=|date=|website=|language=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement of volumes==
[[Image:Meniscus.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.70|A '''meniscus''' as seen in a [[burette]] of colored water. '20.00 mL' is the correct depth measurement.]]
When reading a depth scale on the side of an instrument filled with liquid, such as a [[water level device]], the meniscus must be taken into account in order to obtain an accurate measurement. Depth must be measured with the meniscus at eye level (to eliminate [[parallax error]]) and at the center of the meniscus, i.e. the top of a convex meniscus or the bottom of a concave meniscus.

Manufacturers of glassware and other tools calibrate their measurement marks to account for the meniscus. This means that any instrument is calibrated for a specific liquid, usually water.

==Capillary action==
Menisci are a manifestation of [[capillary action]], by which surface adhesion pulls a liquid up to form a concave meniscus or internal cohesion pulls the liquid down to form a convex meniscus. This phenomenon is important in [[transpirational pull]] in plants. When a tube of a narrow bore, often called a capillary tube, is dipped into a liquid and the liquid [[wetting|wets]] the tube (with zero contact angle), the liquid surface inside the tube forms a concave meniscus, which is a virtually spherical surface having the same radius, ''r'', as the inside of the tube.  The tube experiences a downward force of magnitude 2πrσ, where σ is the surface tension of the liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/211272/fluid-mechanics/77482/Surface-tension-of-liquids|title=Fluid Mechanics|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mineral bonded wood wool boards''' (WW boards) are building boards made of [[wood wool]] fibres, water and the binding agents [[cement]], [[Magnesium oxide|caustic magnesia]] and [[gypsum]]. Mineral bound wood wool boards are used in a wide range of applications, e.g., [[thermal insulation]], [[Soundproofing|acoustic insulation]], indoor decoration, etc.

Historical brand names include Ceban, Erulit, Fibrolith,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/2913082/DE/ Fibrolith in the register information of the German Patent and Trademark Office]'', archivdate = 16 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Frankotekt, Hapec, Hapri,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/513368/DE/ Hapri in the register information of the German Patent and Trademark Office]'', archivdate = 16 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Heraklith,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/328605/DE/ Heraklith in the register information of the German Patent and Trademark Office]'', archivdate = 16 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Hincolith, Holwolith, Klimalit, Lenzolite, Lignolith, Lossius and Saalith.&lt;ref name="fach"&gt;F. Kollmann. Vergütete Hölzer und holzhaltige Bau- und Werkstoffe. Begriffe und Zeichen. pp. 42-45. Springer Verlag 1942 Berlin Heidelberg GmbH&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the term ''[[wool]]'', laypersons sometimes mistake wood wool boards with ''wood fibre insulating boards'', a different insulation material that does not contain mineral bindings.

In German speaking areas, because of their surface also known as ''sauerkraut plates''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[:de:Holzwolle-Leichtbauplatte/|German Wikipedia Sauerkrautplatte]]'', archivdate = 16 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Wood wool boards were standardised in 1938 according to [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] 1101 and are therefore among the oldest insulation materials made of renewable raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Fachagentur Nachwachsende Rohstoffe e. V. (Hrsg.): Dämmstoffe aus Nachwachsenden Rohstoffen. 2. Auflage. 2008, S. 24(-27).&lt;/ref&gt; This standard was replaced by European Standard [[European Committee for Standardization|EN]] 13168 in January 2002.

== Materials and production ==
Wood wool boards and wood-wool layers in composite boards are generally manufactured using coniferous wood species, mainly spruce and pine. The wood logs are processed to make wood fibres of various widths, generally between 1mm and 3mm. After drying the wood, it is planed into long fibres in a wood wool machine. The fibres are then mixed with the binding agent (caustic magnesite or cement) in a water solution, in a mixer. Wood wool boards which are bound with magnesite are easily distinguishable by their beige colour. Boards which are bound with grey cement have a greyish colour. White cement is used to maintain the natural colour of the wood. The combination of wood wool fibres and binding agent is automatically fed into a moulding line to be shaped according to the required board dimensions (length, width and thickness). After pre-compaction, the endless row of moulds filled with the mixture is separated into individual moulds with a saw. The moulds are stacked on top of each other, pressed again and weighted so that they are perfectly flush with each other. After hardening of the binder (usually between 24 and 48 hours) the moulds are removed, the semi-finished boards are dried and cut to raw size. The products are then taken to the maturation stock where they will remain for a period that depends on type of binder and thickness. The boards can be subject to further processing in the finishing department, e.g. in case a special edge profile or board shape is needed. The whole production process is carried out in such way that the product meets the requirements set in [[European Committee for Standardization|EN]] 13168.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.waermedaemmstoffe.com/htm/leichtbauplatten.htm Website of the Energy Consultant Dipl.-Ing. Lars Nierobis]'', archivdate = 16 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
Wood wool boards are rigid and very strong. Their thermal conductivity is higher than other insulation material between 0.070 and 0.100 W/mK compared with mineral wool insulation materials to approximately 0.040 W/mK. But their specific thermal capacity and therefore summer heat insulation is higher than other materials, e.g. when installed in lofts’ pitched roofs, wood wool boards offer better properties than basic dry wall systems in terms of summer heat insulation. Wood wool boards can be made to offer a high degree of sound insulation (e.g. if they are plastered) or sound absorption performance (e.g. non-plastered boards) and a good moisture-regulating capacity thanks to their open structure. In the harmonized Euroclass system of reaction to fire performance of building products, wood wool boards can be classified as A2-s1,d0 according to [[European Committee for Standardization|EN]] 13501-1 Fire classification of construction products and building elements; Part 1: Classification using data from reaction to fire tests.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/euroclass/euroclass.html Fire classification of construction products and building elements]'', archivdate = 16 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In combination with other insulation materials (e.g [[mineral wool]]), the resistance against fire can reach up to two hundred forty minutes depending on the product’s thickness and setup.

== Multi-layer lightweight building boards ==

Wood wool composite boards (WW-C boards) are a two- or three-layer combination of wood wool boards and various insulation materials (mineral fibre boards, EPS boards, XPS boards, etc…) The thickness of the wood wool layer in a composite board is at least 5&amp;nbsp;mm. Due to the higher insulation effect of the mineral or synthetic insulation layer, composite boards provide a higher level of thermal insulation relative to single wood wool boards.

'''Nirmal toys''' are traditional Indian wooden [[toy]]s made in the town of [[Nirmal]] in the [[Adilabad district]] in the newly formed state of [[Telangana]] in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/10/07/stories/2010100758170200.htm |title=News Archives |publisher=The Hindu |date=2010-10-26 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Nirmal Painting1.jpg|thumb|left|Nirmal Paintings-Village lady]]
Nirmal Art, encompassing a 400-year-old tradition of making soft wood toys and paintings, occupies a place of pride in the world of handicrafts. The finely carved figures and dainty paintings are still being used to decorate drawing rooms in thousands of homes across the country. Nirmal district in Telangana was once famous as a production centre of as diverse things as cannons and toys. While the foundry supplied heavy artillery to the army of the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Naqqash craftsmen and artists brought out exquisite wooden toys and duco paintings under the name of Nirmal Art.
The foundry was closed soon after Hyderabad's accession but the art form has survived many ups and downs, the most impacting being the loss of its patron, the Nizam. Elegant toys and paintings continue to be produced by the Naqqash artisans at this town located just 4&amp;nbsp;km off the new four lane National Highway No. 7 about 220&amp;nbsp;km from Hyderabad.
Though no records pertaining to their origins exist now, it is believed the Naqqash families were brought here from Rajasthan in the 17th century by Neema Naik (or Nimma Naidu according to another version), the local chieftain after whom the town itself is named. Many changes have since been incorporated in their art form obviously to suit the taste of the patrons of the time.

==Description==
[[File:Nirmal toys3.jpg|thumb|right|Nirmal wooden toys-tiger couple]]
Initially, the Naqqash, or Jingar artisans, had produced only toys from the locally available variety of softwood called poniki or white sander. They made wooden furniture during the last Nizam's rule.
Now, they are carved from local [[softwood]] and painted with [[Duco]] paints. 
The Jingars have discontinued making the fine Kishti (tray), Khanchibba chowki (settee) or the Palang (cot) owing to the change in customs. “These articles were used as dowry gifts in marriages and were ordered mostly by the Muslim nobility during the time of the Nizam".
[[Ganjifa]] playing cards are also traditionally made in Nirmal, but as of February 2011, only one elderly artisan was still making them. The artists shifted from natural dyes to duco paints. Due to use of the duco colours, the Nirmal paintings acquire a typical shine. The toys are also painted in enamel colours giving them the sheen they are known for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/kids/article1477067.ece |title=From the Toyland of Andhra Pradesh |publisher=The Hindu |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NASA-project-orion-artist.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An artist's conception of the [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] "basic" spacecraft, powered by nuclear pulse propulsion.]]
'''Nuclear pulse propulsion''' or '''external pulsed plasma propulsion''', is a hypothetical method of [[spacecraft propulsion]] that uses [[nuclear explosion]]s for [[thrust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20000097368_2000138015.pdf |title=External Pulsed Plasma Propulsion (EPPP) Analysis Maturation |last=Bonometti |first=Joseph A. |author2=P. Jeff Morton  |publisher=Nasa Marshall Space Flight Center |accessdate=December 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first developed as [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project ''Orion'']] by [[DARPA]], after a suggestion by [[Stanislaw Ulam]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oriondrive.com/p1_story_history.php |title=History of Project Orion |website=The Story of Orion |date=2008–2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer designs using [[inertial confinement fusion]] have been the baseline for most post-''Orion'' designs, including [[Project Daedalus|Project ''Daedalus'']] and [[Project Longshot|Project ''Longshot'']].

==Project Orion==
{{Main|Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)}}
[[File:Orion pulse unit.png|thumb| A nuclear pulse propulsion unit. The explosive charge [[radiation implosion|ablatively vaporizes]] the propellant, propelling it away from the charge, and simultaneously creating a plasma out of the propellant. The propellant then goes on to impact the pusher plate at the bottom of the Orion spacecraft, imparting a pulse of 'pushing' energy.]]

Project Orion was the first serious attempt to design a nuclear pulse rocket. The design effort was carried out at [[General Atomics]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The idea of ''Orion'' was to react small directional nuclear explosives utilizing a variant of the [[Teller-Ulam]] two-stage bomb design against a large steel pusher plate attached to the spacecraft with shock absorbers. Efficient directional explosives maximized the momentum transfer, leading to [[specific impulse]]s in the range of 6,000 seconds, or about thirteen times that of the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]. With refinements a theoretical maximum of 100,000 seconds (1 MN·s/kg) might be possible. Thrusts were in the millions of [[ton]]s, allowing spacecraft larger than 8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; tons to be built with 1958 materials.&lt;ref name="GeneralDynamics1964NuclearPulseVehicleCondensed"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760065935_1976065935.pdf| format=PDF| title=Nuclear Pulse Vehicle Study Condensed Summary Report (General Dynamics Corp.)|date=January 1964| author=[[General Dynamics]] Corp.| publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce National Technical Information Service| accessdate=December 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[reference design]] was to be constructed of steel using submarine-style construction with a crew of more than 200 and a vehicle takeoff weight of several thousand [[ton]]s.
This low-tech single-stage reference design would reach Mars and back in four weeks from the Earth's surface (compared to 12 months for NASA's current chemically powered reference mission). The same craft could visit Saturn's moons in a seven-month mission (compared to chemically powered missions of about nine years).

A number of engineering problems were found and solved over the course of the project, notably related to crew shielding and pusher-plate lifetime. The system appeared to be entirely workable when the project was shut down in 1965, the main reason being given that the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] made it illegal (however, before the treaty, the US and Soviet Union had already detonated at least nine nuclear bombs, including thermonuclear bombs, in space, i.e., at altitudes over 100&amp;nbsp;km: see [[high altitude nuclear explosion]]s). There were also [[nuclear ethics|ethical]] issues with launching such a vehicle within the Earth's [[magnetosphere]]: calculations using the now disputed [[linear no-threshold model]] of radiation damage showed that the fallout from each takeoff would kill between 1 and 10 people.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, George. Project Orion – The Atomic Spaceship 1957-1965. Penguin. {{ISBN|0-14-027732-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a threshold model, such extremely low levels of thinly distributed radiation would have no associated ill-effects, while under hormesis models, such tiny doses would be negligibly beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Heyes| display-authors = etal| title = Authors' reply| date = 1 October 2006| url = http://bjr.birjournals.org/cgi/content/citation/79/946/855| accessdate =27 March 2008| doi = 10.1259/bjr/52126615| journal = British Journal of Radiology| volume = 79| issue = 946| pages = 855–857}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Aurengo| display-authors = etal| title = Dose-effect relationships and estimation of the carcinogenic effects of low doses of ionizing radiation| publisher = Académie des Sciences &amp; Académie nationale de Médecine| date = 30 March 2005| url = http://www.radscihealth.org/rsh/Papers/FrenchAcadsFinal07_04_05.pdf| accessdate = 27 March 2008| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725061127/http://www.radscihealth.org/rsh/Papers/FrenchAcadsFinal07_04_05.pdf| archivedate = 25 July 2011| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the possible use of less efficient [[Nuclear weapon design#Clean bombs|clean nuclear bombs]] for achieving orbit and then more efficient higher yield dirty bombs for travel would bring down the amount of fallout caused from an Earth-based launch by a significant factor.

{{Anchor|deflect2016-01-30}}One useful mission for this near-term technology would be to deflect an asteroid that could collide with the Earth, depicted dramatically in the 1998 film ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'', even though it was a comet in that particular film. The extremely high performance would permit even a late launch to succeed, and the vehicle could effectively transfer a large amount of kinetic energy to the asteroid by simple impact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solem|first=J. C.|year=1994|title=Nuclear explosive propelled interceptor for deflecting objects on collision course with Earth|journal=Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets|volume=31|issue=4|pages=707–709|bibcode=1994JSpRo..31..707S|doi=10.2514/3.26501}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the event of an imminent asteroid impact a few predicted deaths from [[fallout]] would probably not be considered prohibitive. Also, an automated mission would eliminate the most problematic issues of the design: the shock absorbers.

Orion is one of very few interstellar space drives that could theoretically be constructed with available technology, as discussed in a 1968 paper, ''Interstellar Transport'' by [[Freeman Dyson]].

==Project Daedalus==
{{Main|Project Daedalus}}
Project Daedalus was a study conducted between 1973 and 1978 by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] (BIS) to design a plausible interstellar unmanned spacecraft that could reach a nearby star within one human scientist's working lifetime or about 50 years. A dozen scientists and engineers led by [[Alan Bond (engineer)|Alan Bond]] worked on the project. At the time [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] research appeared to be making great strides, and in particular, [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) appeared to be adaptable as a rocket engine.

ICF uses small pellets of fusion fuel, typically [[Lithium hydride#Lithium deuteride|lithium deuteride]] (&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H) with a small [[deuterium]]/[[tritium]] trigger at the center. The pellets are thrown into a reaction chamber where they are hit on all sides by [[laser]]s or another form of beamed energy. The heat generated by the beams explosively compresses the pellet, to the point where fusion takes place. The result is a hot [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], and a very small "explosion" compared to the minimum size bomb that would be required to instead create the necessary amount of fission.

For Daedalus, this process was run within a large [[electromagnet]] which formed the rocket engine. After the reaction, ignited by electron beams in this case, the magnet funnelled the hot gas to the rear for thrust. Some of the energy was diverted to run the ship's systems and engine. In order to make the system safe and energy efficient, Daedalus was to be powered by a [[helium-3]] fuel that would have had to be collected from [[Jupiter]].

==''Medusa''==
[[File:MedusaNuclearPropulsionConceptDrawing.png|thumb|left|300px|Conceptual diagram of a Medusa propulsion spacecraft, showing: '''(A)''' the payload capsule, '''(B)''' the winch mechanism, '''(C)''' the optional main tether cable, '''(D)''' riser tethers, and '''(E)''' the parachute mechanism.]]
[[File:MedusaNuclearPropulsionOperatingSequenceDrawing.png|thumb|right|200px|Operating sequence of the ''Medusa'' propulsion system. This diagram shows the operating sequence of a ''Medusa'' propulsion spacecraft '''(1)''' Starting at moment of explosive-pulse unit firing, '''(2)''' As the explosive pulse reaches the parachute canopy, '''(3)''' Pushes the canopy, accelerating it away from the explosion as the spacecraft plays out the main tether with the winch, generating electricity as it extends, and accelerating the spacecraft, '''(4)''' And finally winches the spacecraft forward to the canopy and uses excess electricity for other purposes.]]

The ''Medusa'' design is a type of nuclear pulse propulsion which has more in common with [[solar sail]]s than with conventional rockets. It was envisioned by [[Johndale Solem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilster|first=Paul|title=Centauri Dreams: Imagining and Planning Interstellar Exploration |publisher=Copernicus Books, Atlanta Book Company|year=2004|isbn=978-0387004365|pages=86|accessdate=2015-10-26|url=https://books.google.com/?id=57HbBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=johndale+solem+medusa#v=onepage&amp;q=johndale%20solem%20medusa&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s and published in the ''[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]]'' (JBIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solem|first=J. C.|title=Medusa: Nuclear explosive propulsion for interplanetary travel|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|volume=46|number=1|pages=21–26|date=January 1993 |bibcode=1993JBIS...46R..21S|issn=0007-084X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Medusa'' spacecraft would deploy a large “spinnaker” sail ahead of it, attached by separate independent cables, and then launch nuclear explosives forward to detonate between itself and its sail. The sail would be accelerated by the plasma and photonic impulse, running out the tethers as when a fish flees the fisherman, and generating electricity at the “reel”.  The spacecraft would then use some of the generated electricity to reel itself up towards the sail, constantly smoothly accelerating as it goes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solem|first=J. C.|title=Nuclear explosive propulsion for interplanetary travel: Extension of the ''Medusa'' concept for higher specific impulse|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=47|number=6|pages=229–238|date=June 1994|bibcode=1994JBIS...47..229S |issn=0007-084X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original design, multiple tethers connected to multiple motor generators.  The advantage over the single tether is to increase the distance between the explosion and the tethers, thus reducing damage to the tethers.

For heavy payloads, performance could be improved by taking advantage of lunar materials, for example, wrapping the explosive with lunar rock or water, likely stored previously at a stable Earth-Moon [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange point]] to be subsequently acquired by the ''Medusa'' spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solem|first=J. C.|title=The Moon and the Medusa - Use of Lunar Assets in Nuclear-Pulse-Propelled Space Travel |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|volume=53|number=1|pages=362–370|date=2000|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2000.53.362|bibcode=2000JBIS...53..362S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Medusa'' performs better than the classical Orion design because its sail intercepts more of the explosive impulse, its shock-absorber stroke is much longer, and all its major structures are in tension and hence can be quite lightweight. ''Medusa''-type ships would be capable of a [[specific impulse]] between 50,000 and 100,000 seconds (500 to 1000&amp;nbsp;kN·s/kg).

''Medusa'' is widely known to the public in the BBC documentary film [[To Mars By A-Bomb (film)|''To Mars By A-Bomb: The Secret History of Project Orion'']].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/company/co0043107/?ref_=tt_dt_co British Broadcasting Corp. (BBC).]  (2003). [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1039992/ “To Mars By A-Bomb: The Secret History of Project Orion”], a documentary film.&lt;/ref&gt;  A short film shows an artist’s conception of how the ''Medusa'' spacecraft works “by throwing bombs into a sail that's ahead of it!”&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Nick.  (2014). “[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT4ZdPRADEw The Medusa - An advanced nuclear pulse spacecraft]”, a film.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project Longshot==
{{Main|Project Longshot}}
Project Longshot was a [[NASA]]-sponsored research project carried out in conjunction with the [[US Naval Academy]] in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Beals |first=Keith A. |display-authors=etal  |title=Project Longshot An Unmanned Probe To Alpha Centauri|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19890007533_1989007533.pdf |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Longshot'' was in some ways a development of the basic Daedalus concept, in that it used magnetically funneled ICF as a rocket. The key difference was that they felt that the reaction could not power both the rocket and the systems, and instead included a 300&amp;nbsp;kW conventional [[nuclear reactor]] for running the ship. The added weight of the reactor reduced performance somewhat, but even using LiD fuel it would be able to reach [[Alpha Centauri]], the closest solar system to our own, in 100 years (approx. velocity of 13,411&amp;nbsp;km/s, at a distance of 4.5 light years - equivalent to 4.5% of light speed).

==Antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion==
{{Main|Antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion}}

In the mid-1990s research at the [[Pennsylvania State University]] led to the concept of using [[antimatter]] to catalyze nuclear reactions. In short, [[antiproton]]s would react inside the nucleus of [[uranium]], causing a release of energy that breaks the nucleus apart as in conventional nuclear reactions. Even a small number of such reactions can start the [[chain reaction]] that would otherwise require a much larger volume of fuel to sustain. Whereas the "normal" [[Critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]] for [[plutonium]] is about 11.8 kilograms (for a sphere at standard density), with antimatter catalyzed reactions this could be well under one gram.

Several rocket designs using this reaction were proposed, some which would use all-fission reactions for interplanetary missions, and others using fission-fusion (effectively a very small version of Orion's bombs) for interstellar missions.

'''Fuel''':           Deuterium-Tritium Cryogenic Pellet

'''Propellent''': Lithium or Aluminum

  }}
NASA funded [[MSNW LLC]] and the [[University of Washington]] in 2011 to study and develop a [[fusion rocket]] through the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts [[NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts|NIAC]] Program.&lt;ref&gt;2011 NIAC Phase I Selections http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/slough_nuclear_propulsion.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The rocket uses a form of [[magneto-inertial fusion]] to produce a direct thrust fusion rocket. Powerful magnetic fields cause large metal rings (likely made of lithium, where a set for one pulse has a total mass of 365 grams) to collapse around the [[deuterium]]-[[tritium]] plasma, compressing it to a fusion state. Energy from these fusion reactions heats and ionizes the shell of metal formed by the crushed rings. The hot, ionized metal is shot out of a magnetic rocket nozzle at a high speed (up to 30&amp;nbsp;km/s). Repeating this process roughly every minute would propel the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;“Nuclear Propulsion based on Inductively Driven Liner Compression of Fusion Plasmoids”.  Slough, J., Kirtley, D., AIAA Aerospace Sciences Conference, 2011.http://msnwllc.com/Papers/FDR_AIAA_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The fusion reaction is not self-sustaining and requires electrical energy to induce fusion. With electrical requirements estimated to be between 100&amp;nbsp;kW to 1,000&amp;nbsp;kW (300&amp;nbsp;kW average), spacecraft designs incorporate solar panels to produce the electrical energy needed for the fusion engine.&lt;ref name="sloughetal"/&gt; 
 
This approach uses Foil Liner Compression to create a fusion reaction of the proper energy scale to be used for space propulsion. The proof of concept experiment in Redmond, Washington, will use aluminum liners for compression. However, the actual rocket design will run with lithium liners.&lt;ref&gt;Mission Design Architecture for the Fusion Driven Rocket.  Pancotti, A., Slough, J. Kirtley, D. et al.

The performance characteristics of the engine are highly dependent on the [[fusion gain|Fusion energy gain factor]] achieved by the reactor. Gains are expected to be between a factor of 20 and 200, with an estimated average of 40. With higher fusions gains comes higher exhaust velocity, higher specific impulse and lower electrical power requirements. The table below summarizes different performance characteristics for a theoretical 90-day Mars transfer at gains of 20, 40 and 200.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6446">An '''odorizer''' is a device that adds an [[odorant]] to a gas.  The most common type is one that adds a [[gas odorant|mercaptan]] liquid into [[natural gas]] distribution systems so that leaks can be readily detected. Other types have been used for [[carbon dioxide]] [[fire extinguishers]].

==Natural gas odorizers==
Natural gas odorizers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=Winston C. "Small Station Odorizers"|title=Odorization III|year=1993|publisher=Institute of Gas Technology|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=0910091897|editor=Gerald G. Wilson &amp; Amir A Attari|pages=45–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  run the gamut from a simple wick in a container to computerized equipment, which controls the amount of odorant based on flow rate, tracks the amount of odorant in inventory, and alarms when odorant is not being injected into the gas stream.

Odorants used for natural gas vary from country to country, depending on gas distribution regulations. Some odorants contain sulfur, which is oxidized to [[sulfur dioxide]] when the gas is burned.  

Sulfur containing odorants include:
* [[tert-Butylthiol]] (TBM) the main ingredient in many gas odorant blends
* [[Tetrahydrothiophene]] (THT), used as an odorant for natural gas, usually in mixtures containing tert-butylthiol
* 2-Propanethiol, commonly known as isopropyl mercaptan (IPM) is used as an odorant for natural gas usually in mixtures containing tert-butylthiol
* [[Ethanethiol]] (EM), commonly known as ethyl [[mercaptan]] is used in [[Liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG), and resembles odor of leeks, onions, durian, or cooked cabbage
* [[Dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS), a component of the smell produced from cooking of certain vegetables, notably maize, cabbage, beetroot, and seafoods


Non-sulfur containing odorants include:
* [[Methyl acrylate]] (MA)
* [[Ethyl acrylate]] (EA)
* [[Alkylpyrazine|Methylethyl pyrazine]],&lt;ref name="TenkratHlincik2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tenkrat|first1=Daniel|last2=Hlincik|first2=Tomas|last3=Prokes|first3=Ondrej|title=Natural Gas Odorization|year=2010|doi=10.5772/9825}}&lt;/ref&gt; odor of various foods including coffee and wines

==Wick type odorizers==
Wick type odorizers can be very small, odorizing the gas for as few as one gas customer to much larger ones that can odorize the gas for a small town (10,000 MCF).  They use a [[Candle wick|wick]] which is very similar to those used in a [[kerosene lantern]].  The odorant is drawn up the wick from the container and into the gas stream.

==Absorption bypass odorizers==
Absorption bypass odorizers take a portion of the gas stream, the amount being dependent on the flow of gas in the line, and run it through a tank containing liquid odorant. The gas is passed over the top of the liquid. Variations exist where wicks are utilized to increase odorant vaporization.

==Liquid injection type odorizers==
For very high volume systems (and for some smaller volume systems), liquid injection odorizers are being manufactured.  These odorizers work by the addition of small amounts of liquid odorant to the moving gas.  A pump that can be controlled to give the range of addition rates necessary is a very important aspect of this type of odorizer.  Computer control to monitor flow rates and vary injection rate is a significant part of the more modern versions of this.  Previous versions worked off a variety of schemes to control the odorization level.

The Peerless odorizer was the first example of this type of odorizer.  The Peerless natural-gas odorizer was recognized as a Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peerless Type "M" Odorizer|url=http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5615.pdf|publisher=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This odorizer was said to have been developed in response to the New London School explosion that occurred in March 1937.  It was first shipped in July 1937, the Peerless odorizer overcame two of the major problems of previous devices:

#Peerless avoided problems with leaky shaft seals, by encapsulating the entire unit within a pressure vessel.
#Peerless added odorant in proportion to the gas flow, by using a gas meter to drive the odorant pump.

==Other odorizers==

===Carbon dioxide fire extinguishers===
Odorizers are used in carbon dioxide fire extinguisher systems, the odorizer assembly injects [[wintergreen oil]] into the [[carbon dioxide]] stream when the agent is discharged. Approximately 50 cc of wintergreen oil contained within a frangible glass cartridge is mounted within a protective housing attached to the discharge piping in such a manner as to rupture the glass container when the carbon dioxide manifold is pressurized during discharge, atomizing the oil and dispersing it.  The strong wintergreen scent effectively notifies the occupants of the presence of carbon dioxide gas after carbon dioxide has been discharged into the hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tomcosystems.com/fire-systems-products/odorizer/ |title=Odorizer |author=TomCO2 Fire Systems|accessdate=2012-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orrprotection.com/docs/ansul/Odorizer.pdf |title= Ansul Carbon Dioxide System Components to add wintergreen odor|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fire-protection.com.au/files/E.1.28.01WintergreenOdorizer.pdf|title= Fike odorizer injects a small amount of wintergreen scent into carbon dioxide flow|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mine gas warning systems===
Similar systems are used in mines, where ampoules of [[ethanethiol]] are broken in front of ventilation fans to warn of gas in the mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zacon Limited|title=Stench System|url=http://www.zacon.ca/stench-gas.asp|publisher=Zacon Limited|accessdate=2012-05-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403223737/http://zacon.ca/stench-gas.asp|archivedate=2015-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2753">[[File:Gliederpuppe.jpg|thumb|Peg wooden doll from [[Val Gardena]], 1850]]

'''Peg wooden dolls''', also known as '''Dutch dolls''', are a type of wooden doll from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]]. They originated as simple lathe-turned dolls from the [[Val Gardena]] in the [[Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lusenberg.com/chiena/toymanufacture.html Rita Stäblein, Robert Moroder: ''Toy manufacture as a cottage Industry in old Gröden.'' Museum Gherdëina, Urtijëi, 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt; These dolls were sold undressed. Children would then make their clothing from scraps of fabric.

Other similarly constructed wooden dolls, using a jointing technique where the arms and/or legs are attached to the body with pegs, are some of the oldest surviving [[doll]]s, and were made worldwide. Sometimes a peg wooden doll's arms or legs are locked together by the jointing system, so if one arm is moved the other will move. An advanced form of peg joints is where the body pegs are "split" and attached separately allowing independent movement.

''Tuck comb dolls'' are a special style of peg wooden doll, named for their carved hair [[comb]]. The head and body are turned as one piece. The hair is usually painted with curled fringes and with a painted comb. Early tuck comb dolls had elongated, graceful proportions, nicely carved details, painted slippers, and sometimes with wood pendant earrings. Some dressed as merchants were called ''pedlar dolls''.

[[Florence Kate Upton]] illustrated a children's book entitled ''The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a [[Golliwogg]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16770/16770-h/16770-h.htm The Project Gutenberg EBook of'' The Adventure of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg'', by Bertha Upton]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Museum Gherdëina]] has a collection of Dutch dolls of different sizes.

The land on Penguin Island became subject to protection after the decommissioning of the [[Penguin Island Lighthouse]] in 1960 due to recognition by the [[government of South Australia|South Australian government]] of ‘the importance of Penguin Island as a seabird haven’.  Initially, the island was resumed under the ''Crown Lands Act 1929-57'' and then it was declared as a Closed Area under the ''Animals and Birds Protection Act 1919-1953''.  In 1961, the island was established as a wildlife reserve.  On 9 November 1967, the entire island was proclaimed under the ''National Parks Act 1966'' as ''Penguin Island National Parks Reserve''.&lt;ref name="SAGG-1967"&gt;{{cite web|last1= Walsh |first1= Frank |title= NATIONAL PARKS ACT, 1966: VARIOUS NATIONAL PARKS NAMED. |url= http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/sa_gazette/1967/51/2043.pdf |website=South Australian Government Gazette|publisher=South Australian Government|accessdate=17 March 2018|page= 2043 |date=9 November 1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Land associated with Cape Martin was added to the protected area in 1970 and 1976 respectively.&lt;ref name=mp/&gt;&lt;ref name=pages314-15/&gt;

'''Semtex''' is a general-purpose [[plastic explosive]] containing [[RDX]] and [[Pentaerythritol tetranitrate|PETN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/explosives-compositions.htm|title=Explosives - Compounds|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in commercial blasting, [[demolition]], and in certain [[military]] applications. 

Semtex was developed and manufactured in [[Czechoslovakia]], originally under the name '''B 1''' and then under "Semtex" designation since 1964,{{#tag:ref|Various sources state that production started in 1964 or 1966.

==Composition==
The composition of the two most common variants differ according to their use. The '''1A''' (or '''10''') variant is used for [[Rock blasting|blasting]], and is based mostly on crystalline [[Pentaerythritol tetranitrate|PETN]]. The version '''1AP''' and '''2P''' are formed as hexagonal [[Explosive booster|booster charges]]; a special assembly of PETN and wax inside the charge assures high reliability for [[detonating cord]] or [[detonator]]. The '''H''' (or '''SE''') variant is intended for [[Shock hardening|explosion hardening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Semtex|url=http://www.mondial-defence.com/images/PDF_Data_Sheets/SEMTEX.pdf|publisher=Mondial Defence Systems|work=Explosives|accessdate=2012-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Semtex was invented in the late 1950s by [[Stanislav Brebera]] and Radim Fukátko, chemists at VCHZ Synthesia, [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Czech Republic]]). The explosive is named after Semtín, a suburb of [[Pardubice]] where the mixture was first manufactured starting in 1964.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The plant was later renamed to become [[Explosia a.s.]], a subsidiary of Synthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explosia.cz/en/?show=vdatech|title=Explosia|website=www.explosia.cz|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semtex was very similar to other plastic explosives, especially [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]], in being highly [[malleable]]; but it is usable over a greater temperature range than other plastic explosives, since it stays plastic between −40 and +60&amp;nbsp;°C. It is also waterproof. There are visual differences between Semtex and other plastic explosives, too: while C-4 is off-white in colour, Semtex is red or brick-orange.

The new explosive was widely exported, notably to the government of [[North Vietnam]], which received 14 tons during the [[Vietnam War]]. However, the main consumer was [[Libya]]; about 700 tons of Semtex were exported to Libya between 1975 and 1981 by [[Omnipol]]. It has also been used by Islamic militants in the [[Middle East]] and by  the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, G. I. (1998). ''The Big Bang: A History of Explosives''. Sutton Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7509-1878-0}}. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exports fell after the name became closely associated with terrorist attacks. Export of Semtex was progressively tightened and since 2002 all of Explosia's sales have been controlled by a government ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Arie Farnam, [http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0226/p07s02-woeu.html "Czechs try to cap plastic explosives sales"], ''Christian Science Monitor'', 26 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2001}}, only approximately 10 tons of Semtex were produced annually, almost all for domestic use.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; On December 21, 1988, 12 ounces (340g) of Semtex [[Pan Am Flight 103|brought down a Boeing 747]] over Lockerbie, Scotland killing all 259 aboard the aircraft and many on the ground, some bodies were never recovered.

Also in response to international agreements, Semtex has a [[taggant|detection taggant]] added to produce a distinctive vapor signature to aid detection. First, [[ethylene glycol dinitrate]] was used, later switched to [[DMDNB|2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane]] (3,4-dinitrohexane, DMDNB) or ''p''-[[mononitrotoluene]], which is used currently. According to the manufacturer, the taggant agent was voluntarily being added by 1991, years before the protocol signed became compulsory.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Batches of Semtex made before 1990, however, are untagged, though it is not known whether there are still major stocks of such old batches of Semtex. According to the manufacturer, even this untagged Semtex can now be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explosia.cz/en/?show=omyly|title=Explosia|website=www.explosia.cz|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[shelf life]] of Semtex was reduced from ten years before the 1990s to five years now. Explosia states that there is no compulsory tagging allowing reliable post-detonation detection of a certain plastic explosive (such as incorporating a unique metallic code into the mass of the explosive), so Semtex is not tagged in this way.&lt;ref name=explosia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explosia.cz/en/?show=omyly|title=Explosia|website=www.explosia.cz|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 1997, [[Bohumil Šole]], a scientist often said to have been involved with inventing Semtex, strapped the explosive to his body and committed [[suicide]] in the [[Vincent Priessnitz|Priessnitz]] [[destination spa|spa]] of [[Jeseník]].&lt;ref&gt;Sieveking, Paul. ''Strange Deaths: More Than 375 Freakish Fatalities'', Barnes &amp; Noble, 2000, pg. 88. {{ISBN|0-7607-1947-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Šole, 63, was being treated there for [[Clinical depression|depression]]. Twenty other people were hurt in the explosion, while six were seriously injured. According to the manufacturer, Explosia, he was not a member of the team that developed the explosive.

A '''Stobie pole''' is a power line pole made of two steel [[joists]] held apart by a slab of concrete.  It was invented by  [[Adelaide Electric Supply Company]] engineer James Cyril Stobie (1895–1953).&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Linn, [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160383b.htm 'Stobie, James Cyril (1895–1953)'], [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 16, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp 314–315.&lt;/ref&gt; Stobie used materials easily at hand due to the shortage of suitably long, strong, straight and termite-resistant timber in South Australia.

==History==
In July 1924 the patent application for the pole design was submitted in both English and French, and accepted in November 1925. Stobie described his invention as
&lt;blockquote&gt;"an improved pole adopted to be used for very many purposes, but particularly for carrying electric cables, telegraph wires... [it] consists of two flanged beams of iron or steel, preferably rolled steel joist of ''''H'''' or of channel sections, placed one beside the other with their flanges inward and preferably at a very slight angle one with the other and held together by means of tie bolts, the space between them being filled with cement concrete."&lt;ref name=Linn&gt;Rob Linn, ''ETSA – The Story of Electricity in South Australia'' (1996) pp.38–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

A second patent was granted to Stobie and Frederick William Herbert Weadon in 1946. With John Ragless Brookman&lt;!-- John Ragless Brookman (5 Jun 1885, Thebarton - 15 Sep 1971, Beulah Park)  https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/5023902 --&gt; they formed The Stobie Pole Syndicate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/48849985 |newspaper= The Advertiser |date= 16 November 1939 |page= 8 |title= Public Notices |via= trove.nla.gov.au }}&lt;br&gt;Mentions James Cyril Stobie, Frederick William Herbert Weadon and John Ragless Brookman of Adelaide ... Engineers comprising the Stobie Pole Syndicate applying to extend the terms of two patents.&lt;/ref&gt; for the purpose of patenting the design and then selling the patent or manufacturing rights. The [[Hume Pipe Company]] became their first agents and, while there were numerous international enquiries, South Australia has largely remained the only place where they are widely used.&lt;ref name=Linn/&gt;

==Installations==
Stobie poles are reasonably common in [[Broken Hill]], as well as the [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] CBD and a few thousand are installed across [[Tasmania]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} A few also exist in isolated settlements in the [[Goldfields-Esperance]] region of [[Western Australia]] such as [[Eucla]] and [[Rawlinna]].

The first poles were erected in [[South Terrace, Adelaide|South Terrace]], [[Adelaide city centre|Adelaide]] in 1924, and were then used extensively in building the electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure throughout the state. The Stobie pole was central to the speedy expansion of Adelaide Electricity Supply Company's supply. It was cheap and simple to produce, had a uniform appearance, saved an enormous amount of timber from being cut down, had a long life expectancy and, at the time, was seen as more environmentally sensitive.&lt;ref name=Linn/&gt; [[SA Power Networks]] review alternative pole designs available on the market and has yet to find one with the benefits offered by the Stobie pole.

==Design==
The poles carry supply voltages from 240&lt;!--415 is voltage between wires; each is 240V--&gt; to 275,000 volts and come in various sizes from 9 to 26 metres in length, though studies indicate heights to 36 metres are feasible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=341903057420867;res=IELENG McCormack, John ''Development of 36m Stobie Poles for 275kV Transmission Line''] accessed 22 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The expected service life of a Stobie pole is predicted to be in excess of 80 years.  It is now commonly regarded as a South Australian icon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2003/s830570.htm ''Residents powerless to stop stobie poles being turned into mobile phone towers''], Transcript of ''"Stateline"'' segment, Broadcast 11 April 2003, Reporter: Michael Smyth, abc.net.au, accessed 17 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[SA Power Networks]] manufactures Stobie poles at a plant in [[Angle Park, South Australia]].

Its modern construction is a composite of two steel beams connected intermittently by bolts to manage compressive [[buckling]], with the gap between the beams filled with concrete. The bolts transfer the [[Shear strength|shear]], with an equal number of bolts above and below ground. The poles are tapered from ground level to the top and the toe. This construction uses the [[Tensile strength|tensile]] properties of the steel, giving the poles excellent properties in bending. Stobie pole strength in the strong direction may be up to 4.5 times the weak direction strength.&lt;ref name=TS107&gt;[http://www.sapowernetworks.com.au/public/download.jsp?id=555&amp;page=/centric/industry/contractors_and_designers/technical_standards.jsp TS107 – Overhead Line Design Standard for Transmission &amp; Distribution Systems], SA Power Networks&lt;/ref&gt; Small holes through the concrete enable easy attachment of modular cross-arms, insulators and other hardware. The poles are fireproof, rotproof, and termiteproof. Stobie poles are widely regarded in Australia to be dangerous to vehicles, with collisions sometimes "almost cutting the vehicle in half."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,24565196-421,00.html|title=Driver survives after wrapping a $250,000 Ferrari around a pole in Adelaide|publisher=[[News Limited]]|date=28 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220111947/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,24565196-421,00.html|archivedate=20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/woman-seriously-hurt-in-car-crash-at-mclaren-vale/story-fndo471r-1226483941289|title=Woman seriously hurt in car crash at McLaren Vale (with photo)|date=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/doc-neeson-tells-sad-tale-of-an-angels-classic-from-his-hospital-bed/story-e6frg6n6-1226942787242&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stobie pole designs are carefully calculated to ensure the installation uses a suitably sized pole. Factors such as physical mass ([[Structural load#Dead load|static load]]) of transformers, cross beams, voltage regulators, protection devices, conductors (including tension), etc. are carefully considered, however the wind loading (dynamic load) of this equipment must also be calculated. In some cases the [[Wind engineering|wind loading]] factors far exceed the static load values.&lt;ref name=TS107/&gt;

==Artistic use==
Attempts have been made to beautify their appearance through Stobie pole gardens&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.users.on.net/~arachne/stobie.html Stobie Pole Gardens], [http://www.users.on.net/~arachne/street.html Street Gardening], Re-earthing the Cities.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stobie pole art projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospectgallery.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=37 Stobie Poles art project], City of Prospect, prospect.sa.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospect.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=762&amp;c=1428 Painted Stobie Poles], City of Prospect, prospect.sa.gov.au.&lt;/ref&gt; Renowned artist [[Clifton Pugh]] painted [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]] on a Stobie pole in 1984, but was subsequently asked to "cover up" the genitals on his painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saculture.com/entries/s.html#Stobie%20Pole Stobie Pole], Encyclopaedia of South Australian Culture, saculture.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, a number of Adelaide primary and high schools have also painted murals on Stobie poles located outside the schools.

'''Strip cropping''' is a method of [[agriculture|farming]] which involves cultivating a field partitioned into long, narrow strips which are alternated in a [[crop rotation]] system. It is used when a slope is too steep or when there is no alternative method of preventing [[soil erosion]]. The most common crop choices for strip cropping are closely sown crops such as [[hay]], [[wheat]], or other [[Fodder|forages]] which are alternated with strips of [[row crop]]s, such as [[maize|corn]], [[soybean]]s, [[cotton]], or [[sugar beet]]s.&lt;ref name="mda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mda.state.mn.us/protecting/conservation/practices/contourstrip.aspx|title=Contour Stripcropping|publisher=Minnesota Department of Agriculture|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forages serve primarily as [[cover crop]]s. In certain systems, strips in particularly eroded areas are used to grow permanent protective vegetation; in most systems, however, all strips are alternated on an annual basis.&lt;ref name="sw226"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Frederick R. Troeh, J. Arthur Hobbs &amp; Roy L. Donahue|title=Soil and Water Conservation for Productivity and Environmental Protection|publisher=Prentice Hall|edition=4th|year=2003|page=226|isbn=978-0130968074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions==
Widths of strips are determined by a number of factors, with the two most important being the average wind velocity in a specific site and the features of the slope, particularly the [[Grade (slope)|gradient]].&lt;ref name="bulletin"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd-swt-jJYEC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6|title=Farmers' Bulletin|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|issue=2169|year=1961|page=6|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each strip typically ranges from 25 feet (7.6 m) to 75 feet (23 m) in width, but certain conditions may necessitate widths outside of this range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/agr/agr98/agr98.htm|title=Strip cropping and contouring|author=K.L. Wells|publisher=University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A minimum width of 50 feet (15 m) is ideal for the use of most farm equipment.&lt;ref name="bulletin"/&gt;

==Use in conservation==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
The growing of a cultivated crop (as corn) in strips alternating with strips of a sod-forming crop (as hay) arranged to follow an approximate contour of the land and minimize erosion.

Strip cropping helps to stop soil erosion by creating natural dams for water, helping to preserve the strength of the soil. Certain layers of plants will absorb minerals and water from the soil more effectively than others. When water reaches the weaker soil that lacks the minerals  needed to make it stronger, it normally washes it away. When strips of soil are strong enough to slow down water from moving through them, the weaker soil can't wash away like it normally would. Because of this, farmland stays fertile much longer.

The term strip cropping also refers to a method of [[dry farming]] sometimes used in areas including parts of the [[Great Plains]] of the United States and the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]] of Canada.  To accumulate moisture in these dry areas, cropland is periodically left fallow.  Typically, the fallow and planted areas are organized in parallel long, narrow strips that are oriented normal to the prevailing winds, in order to minimize the erosion of soil from the bare fields.     
Strip farming helps to prevent mass erosion by having the roots of crops hold on to the soil to prevent it from being washed away.

==Types==

===Strip intercropping===
[[Intercropping]] is the practice of growing two or more crops in the same field. In strip intercropping, the field is still divided into strips, but the strips are narrower and contiguous. This helps facilitate modern farm machinery as well as allowing adjoining plants to benefit from synergistic growth effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://store.extension.iastate.edu/Product/pm1763-pdf|title=Strip Intercropping|author=M. Ghaffarzadeh|publisher=Iowa State University Extension|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contour stripcropping===
Contour stripcropping involves employing a crop rotation system down a slope in order to minimize runoff and rain velocity.&lt;ref name="mda"/&gt; It is used mainly on gentle slope gradients. The width of protective strips is often higher than that of the row crop strips so that they may effectively intercept runoff.&lt;ref name="sw226"/&gt;

The project is one of Pakistan's largest private-sector power development project,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skhydro.com/about-us/sponsors.html&lt;/ref&gt; and is being constructed as part of the [[China–Pakistan Economic Corridor]]'s "Early Harvest" projects, although the government of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] disputes this, arguing that financing for the project predates the announcement of CPEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No energy project under CPEC in KP|url=http://nation.com.pk/business/04-Jan-2016/no-energy-project-under-cpec-in-kp|accessdate=13 March 2016|agency=The Nation|date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The project was first envisaged in 1960, and feasibility studies have been carried out by German [[GTZ]], [[Quebec]] based [[Montreal Engineering Company|Montreal Engineering]] and recent detailed design and engineering study was performed by [[Mott Macdonald]] of UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suki Kinari: Landowners threaten to resist acquisition for hydropower project|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/840573/suki-kinari-landowners-threaten-to-resist-acquisition-for-hydropower-project/|accessdate=13 March 2016|publisher=The Express Tribune (Pakistan)|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Private Power and Infrastructure Board of Pakistan identified a number of sites in the country that were deemed attractive for their hydropower potential. In March, 2005, PPIB publicly advertised seven hydro power sites for implementation in the private sector pursuant to the Policy for Power Generation Projects 2002.

SK Hydro Consortium, having the requisite technical and financial strength, submitted its bid for the Suki Kinari Hydropower project. The consortium was prequalified, and a Letter of Interest (LOI) for conducting feasibility study of the project was issued to SK Hydro on 15 November 2005. The government of the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, announced on August 24, 2016 that it has signed an agreement with SK Hydro Private Ltd. and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China to develop and construct the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Background|url=http://www.skhydro.com/about-us/background.html|accessdate=13 March 2016|agency=SK Hydro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project details==
The dam will be constructed as a 54.5 meter high and 336 meter wide concrete gravity dam  with 2 gated spillways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tariff Petition|url=http://www.nepra.org.pk/Tariff/Petitions/2013/Suki%20Kinari%20Tariff%20Petition.pdf|publisher=NEPRA|accessdate=13 March 2016|page=8|date=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Components|url=http://www.skhydro.com/technical/project-components.html|publisher=SK Hydro|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four 218 MW turbines are to be installed as part of the project, and will generate approximately 870 MW of electricity in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salient Features|url=http://www.skhydro.com/technical/salient-features.html|publisher=SK Hydro|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the dam will result in the formation of a 3.1 kilometer long reservoir with a capacity of 9 million cubic meters of water. It will not cause large scale displacement of populations as no villages or towns will be inundated by the resulting dam's reservoir,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tariff Petition|url=http://www.nepra.org.pk/Tariff/Petitions/2013/Suki%20Kinari%20Tariff%20Petition.pdf|publisher=NEPRA|accessdate=13 March 2016|page=9|date=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a four kilometer section of the Kaghan-Naran highway will have to be diverted as a result of construction works and the resulting reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tariff Petition|url=http://www.nepra.org.pk/Tariff/Petitions/2013/Suki%20Kinari%20Tariff%20Petition.pdf|publisher=NEPRA|accessdate=13 March 2016|page=14|date=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying transmission lines will be constructed by Pakistan's National Transmission and Dispatch Company, and is not considered complementary to the project, but is to be constructed separately from the dam itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tariff Petition|url=http://www.nepra.org.pk/Tariff/Petitions/2013/Suki%20Kinari%20Tariff%20Petition.pdf|publisher=NEPRA|accessdate=13 March 2016|page=10|date=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expected completion date for the dam is 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suki Kinari: Landowners threaten to resist acquisition for hydropower project|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/840573/suki-kinari-landowners-threaten-to-resist-acquisition-for-hydropower-project/|accessdate=13 March 2016|publisher=The Express Tribune (Pakistan)|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing and tariff==

The project is being built on a "Build, Own, Operate and Transfer" basis in accordance with Government of Pakistan's Policy for Power Generation Projects 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Determination of the Authority in the matter of Tariff Petition filed by S.K.

'''Tael''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|eɪ|l}};&lt;ref name=OED&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50246079 "Tael" entry] at the [[OED Online]].&lt;/ref&gt; {{zh | t={{linktext|兩}}| s={{linktext|两}}| hp=liǎng| l=| links=yes}}) or '''tahil''' can refer to any one of several [[weight]] [[units of measurement|measures]] of the [[Far East]]. Most commonly, it refers to the [[China|Chinese]] tael, a part of the [[Chinese units of measurement|Chinese system]] of weights and [[currency]].

In [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Southeast Asia]] it is equivalent to 10 [[mace (unit)|mace]] ({{zh | c=錢| hp=qián| l=|links=no}}) or {{frac|16}} [[catty]],&lt;ref name = "hk_law"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "sg_law"&gt;{{cite web|title = Weights and Measures Act (CHAPTER 349) Third Schedule |work = Singapore Statutes | url = http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=1976-REVED-349&amp;doctitle=WEIGHTS%20AND%20MEASURES%20ACT%0A&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part&amp;sl=1&amp;segid=888373245-001666 }}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit with slightly different metric equivalents in these two places. These [[Chinese units of measurement]] are usually used in [[Chinese herbal medicine]] stores as well as gold and silver exchange.

==Names and etymology==
The English word ''tael'' comes through [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word {{lang|ms|tahil}}, meaning "weight". Early English forms of the name such as "tay" or "taes" derive from the Portuguese plural of tael, {{lang|pt|taeis}}.

'''Tahil''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɑː|h|ɪ|l}} in [[Singaporean English]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singlishdictionary.com/singlish_T.htm#tahil "Tahil" entry] at A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English.&lt;/ref&gt; is used in Malay ''and'' English today when referring to the weight in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Brunei]] where it is still used in some contexts especially related to the significant [[Overseas Chinese]] population.

In Chinese, tael is written {{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|兩}}}} (simplified Chinese: {{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|两}}}}) and has the [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation in {{zh | c=| hp=liǎng| l=|links=no}}. In Chinese and Vietnamese, the phrase "half a catty, eight taels" ({{zh | c=半斤八兩 | hp=| l=|links=no}}; Vietnamese:{{lang|vi|kẻ tám lạng người nửa cân}}), meaning two different presentations of the same thing (similar to the English phrase "Six of one and half-a-dozen of the other"), is still often used today.

==Historical usage==
[[File:Chinese_Silver_Liang_with_Stamps_used_in_Central_Asia_as_Silver-Hoff-Ingot.jpg|thumb|A Chinese silver liǎng (两) with stamps Used in Central Asia as a "Silver Hoof" ingot]]
[[File:後藤分銅1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Japan]]ese [[Edo period|Edo era]] tael weights for [[Weighing scale#Mechanical balances|balance scales]], made of [[bronze]]. In descending size, 30, 20, 10, 5, 4, 3, and 2 tael weights.]]
In China, there were many different weighting standards of tael depending on the region or type of trade. In general the [[silver]] tael weighed around {{convert|40|g|ozt}}. The most common government measure was the ''Kuping'' ({{zh|c=庫平|hp=kùpíng|l=treasury standard|labels=no}}) tael, weighing {{convert|37.5|g|ozt}}. A common commercial weight, the ''Caoping'' ({{zh|c=漕平| hp=cáopíng| l=canal shipping standard|labels=no}}) tael weighed {{convert|36.7|g|ozt}} of marginally less pure silver.

As in China, [[Japan]] used the {{Nihongo|tael|両|ryō|lead=yes}} as both a unit of weight and, by extension, a currency.

=== Tael currency ===
Traditional Chinese silver [[sycee]]s and other currencies of fine metals were not denominated or made by a central [[Mint (coin)|mint]] and their value was determined by their weight in taels. They were made by individual silversmiths for local exchange, and as such the shape and amount of extra detail on each ingot were highly variable; square and oval shapes were common but "boat", flower, tortoise and others are known. The local tael also took precedence over any central measure, so the [[Guangzhou|Canton]] tael weighed 37.5 grams, the Convention or [[Shanghai]] tael was 33.9&amp;nbsp;g (1.09 ozt), and the ''Haiguan'' ({{zh|c=海關|p=hǎiguān|l=customs|labels=no}}) tael {{convert|37.8|g|oz ozt|4}}. The conversion rates between various common taels were well known. The tael was still used in [[Qing dynasty coinage]] as the basis of the silver currency and sycee remained in use until the end of the dynasty in 1911. Common weights were 50, 10, 5 and one tael.

Modern studies suggest that, on [[purchasing power parity]] basis, one tael of silver was worth about 4130&amp;nbsp;[[Renminbi|RMB]] (modern Chinese yuan) in the early [[Tang Dynasty]], 2065&amp;nbsp;RMB in the late [[Tang Dynasty]], and 660.8&amp;nbsp;RMB in the mid [[Ming Dynasty]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. Today the price of silver is about 元154RMB/tael.

The [[Thailand|Thai]] equivalent of the tael is known as the ''[[Thai units of measurement|tamlueng]]'', a term derived from [[Khmer language|Khmer]]. It was used as a unit of currency equal to four [[baht]], and as a unit of weight is now standardised at 60&amp;nbsp;grams.

==Current usage==
The tael is still in use as a weight measurement in a number of countries though usually only in limited contexts.

===China===
China's standardised ''market tael'' ({{zh | c=市两| hp=shìliǎng| l=| links=no}}) of 31.25&amp;nbsp;g was modified by the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1959. The new market tael was 50&amp;nbsp;g or {{frac|10}} catty (500&amp;nbsp;g) to make it compatible with [[metric system|metric]] measures. (see [[Chinese unit]] for details.) In Shanghai, silver is still traded in taels.

Some foodstuffs in China are sold in units also called "taels", but which do not necessarily weigh one tael. For cooked rice, the weight of the tael is approximated using special tael-sized ladles. Other items sold in taels include the [[shengjian mantou]] and the [[xiaolongbao]], both small [[baozi|buns]] commonly found in Shanghai. In these cases, one tael is traditionally four and eight buns respectively.

===Hong Kong and Singapore===
The tael is a legal weight measure in [[Hong Kong]], and is still in active use.&lt;ref name = "hk_law"&gt;{{cite web|title = Weights and Measures Ordinance |work = The Law of Hong Kong | url = http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/4ed2ff0cf02f2fd9c82564760077af3c?OpenDocument }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Hong Kong, one tael is 37.799364167 g,&lt;ref name = "hk_law"/&gt; and in ordinance 22 of 1884 is {{frac|1|1|3}} [[ounce|oz. avoir.]] Similar to Hong Kong, in Singapore, one tael is defined as {{frac|1|1|3}} ounce and is approximated as 37.7994 g&lt;ref name = "sg_law"/&gt;

===Taiwan===
The Taiwan tael is 37.5&amp;nbsp;g and is still used in some contexts. The Taiwan tael is derived from the tael or {{Nihongo||両|ryō}} of the [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese system]] (equal to 10 ''momme'') which was 37.5&amp;nbsp;g. Although the [[catty]] (equal to 16&amp;nbsp;taels) is still frequently used in Taiwan, the tael is only used for precious metals and medicines.

===Vietnam===
[[File:Gold_lang_Tu_Duc_CdM.jpg|thumb|120px|Gold lạng (Tael) of [[Tự Đức]]]]
In [[French Indochina]], the colonial administration standardised the tael ''({{lang|vi|lạng}})'' as 100&amp;nbsp;g, which is commonly used at food markets where many items typically weigh in the 100–900&amp;nbsp;g range. However, a different tael (called {{lang|vi|cây}}, {{lang|vi|lạng}}, or {{lang|vi|lượng}}) unit of 37.5&amp;nbsp;g is used for domestic transactions in gold. Real estate prices are often quoted in taels of gold rather than the local currency over concerns over [[monetary inflation]].

The Timber Framers [[Guild]] (the Guild) is a [[501(c) organization|non-profit]], international, membership organization established in 1984 in the United States to improve the quality and education of people practicing the centuries-old art of [[Timber framing]] buildings with timbers joined with primarily wooden joints. Today the stated goals of the Guild are to provide "... national and regional conferences, sponsoring projects and workshops, and publishing a monthly newsletter, Scantlings, and a quarterly journal, Timber Framing "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfguild.org/about-us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107164432/http://www.tfguild.org/about-us |archivedate=2012-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guild is not like medieval guilds in that the emphasis is on education rather than control of this [[Traditional trades|traditional trade]]. Similar organizations are the Carpenters Fellowship in the U. K., [[Compagnons du Tour de France]] in France, and [[:de:Zimmerer|Zimmerman]] in Germany (a German language site). The Guild is not directly associated with the [[United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America]]. Originally the Guild was named the Timber Framers Guild of North America but the "North America" was dropped in recognition of the Guild's international presence.

==Membership==
Membership in the Guild does not necessarily reflect competency but an interest in learning and/or teaching. Membership is not required to practice timber framing. Most members build new timber frames, but many members restore, rehabilitate, preserve and/or study historic timber framed buildings. The philosophies vary widely with some members being innovative and designing buildings of the future, some use computer-controlled machinery to cut frames, some work only with traditional hand-powered tools. Some members use metal connectors rather than traditional wooden joinery.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Sub-groups within or associated with the Guild==
* Traditional Timberframe Research and Advisory Group (TTRAG): Part of the Timber Framers Guild officially formed in 1990.

The TTRAG group produced survey guidelines for recording historic timber framed buildings.

* "The Timber Frame Engineering Council (TFEC) formed in 2005 at a Guild conference in recognition of the considerable number of structural engineers among the Guild membership and in response to a felt need for systematic research, discussion and codification of timber frame joinery and structural practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfguild.org/about/timber-frame-engineering-council |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920184022/http://www.tfguild.org/about/timber-frame-engineering-council |archivedate=2013-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TFEC has developed a Standard for the Design of Timber Framed Structures as a "...supplement to provisions of the National Design Specification for
Wood Construction..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfguild.org/downloads/TFEC-1-2010-with-Commentary.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912053311/http://www.tfguild.org/downloads/TFEC-1-2010-with-Commentary.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to assist engineers in this design specialty.
* Timber Frame Business Council: A non-profit organization focused on the business of timber framing.

==Conferences==
The Guild holds an eastern conference, western conference and TTRAG conference annually. Regional meetings, workshops and projects occur irregularly. For a list of past projects since 1988 see [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402174339/http://www.tfguild.org/downloads/Guild-Project-and-Workshop-Chronology-1988-2012.pdf here.]

== Apprenticeship Program ==
The Guild has created a training program for apprentices to learn the art and science of traditional timber framing from mentors called journeyworkers. "Successful apprentices receive a nationally recognized credential registered by the United States Department of Labor under our program number NO152090893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncptt.nps.gov/timber-framers-guild-apprenticeship-program/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226224853/http://ncptt.nps.gov/timber-framers-guild-apprenticeship-program/ |archivedate=2013-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This program uses a formal curriculum which is still under development as of 2012.

==Publications==
The Guild publishes a newsletter for members, a respected journal Timber Framing, and books on the specialized topics of traditional timber framing. The Guild also lists other relevant books, software and a [https://web.archive.org/web/20121207175716/http://tfguild.businesscatalyst.com/downloads/publications/Glossary-of-Timber-Framing-Terms.pdf Glossary of timber framing terms]. An important record of historic timber frame joints found in the U.S.A. is ''Historic American Timber Joinery: A Graphic Guide'' which was partially funded by a grant from National Park Service and the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training and thus are available for free download.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tfguild.org/downloads/publications/Historic-American-Timber-Joinery.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This guide is expanding as new types of joints are found and recorded.

'''Variable Shunt Reactors''' are used in [[high voltage]] [[energy transmission]] systems to stabilize the voltage during load variations. A traditional shunt reactor has a fixed rating and is either connected to the [[power line]] all the time or switched in and out depending on the load. Recently{{cn|date=December 2011}} Variable Shunt Reactors (VSR) have been developed and introduced on the market. The rating of a VSR can be changed in steps, The maximum regulation range typically is a factor of two, e.g. from 100-200 [[Volt-ampere reactive|Mvar]]. The regulation speed is normally in the order seconds per step and around a minute from max to min rating. VSRs are today available for voltages up to 550 kV. The largest three-phase VSRs in operation have a rating of 120-200 Mvar at 420 kV and single-phase variable shunt reactors banks rated 200-285 Mvar at 420 kV have been installed in Italy.

The variability brings several benefits compared to a traditional fixed shunt reactors. The VSR can continuously compensate [[AC power#Reactive power|reactive power]] as the load varies and thereby securing voltage stability. Other important benefits are:
* reduced voltage jumps resulting from switching in and out of traditional fixed [[Inductor|reactors]]
* flexibility for future (today unknown) load and generation patterns
* improved interaction with other transmission equipment and/or systems such as coarse [[Performance tuning|tuning]] of [[Static VAR compensator|SVC]] equipment
* limiting the foot print of a substation if parallel fixed shunt reactors can be replaced with one VSR
* a VSR can be used as a flexible spare unit and be moved to other locations in the power grid if needed

VSRs are considered{{by whom|date=February 2012}} as technically advanced products and are mainly supplied by larger global manufacturers such as [[ABB Group|ABB]] and [[Siemens]].

Bavi and Pam developed simultaneously as a result of a westerly wind burst.&lt;ref name="NOAAMarch2015"/&gt;]]
A '''westerly wind burst''' is a phenomenon commonly associated with [[El Niño]] events whereby the typical east-to-west [[trade winds]] across the [[equator]]ial Pacific shift to west-to-east. A westerly wind burst is defined by Harrison and Vecchi (1997) as sustained winds of {{convert|25|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} over a period of 5–20&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name="Eisenman2005"/&gt; However, no concrete definition has been determined, with Tziperman and Yu (2007) defining them as having winds of {{convert|14|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and lasting "at least a few days".&lt;ref name="Tziperman2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Eli Tziperman  |author2=Lisan Yu |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Journal of Climate|publisher=American Meteorological Society|volume=20|issue=12|date=October 2007|accessdate=January 9, 2016|title=Quantifying the Dependence of Westerly Wind Bursts on the Large-Scale Tropical Pacific SST|format=PDF|pages=2,760–2,768|doi=10.1175/JCLI4138a.1|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI4138a.1|bibcode = 2007JCli...20.2760T }}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, three of these events take place each year, but are significantly more common during El Niño years. They have been linked to various [[Mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] phenomena, including [[tropical cyclones]], mid-latitude cold surges, and the [[Madden–Julian oscillation]]. Their connection with [[Kelvin wave]]s also indicate a connection with the onset of El Niño events, with every major occurrence since the 1950s featuring a westerly wind burst upon their onset.&lt;ref name="Eisenman2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ian Eisenman |author2=Lisan Yu |author3=Eli Tziperman  |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Journal of Climate|publisher=American Meteorological Society|date=December 2005|accessdate=January 9, 2016|title=Westerly Wind Bursts: ENSO’s Tail Rather than the Dog?|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI3588.1|format=PDF|volume=18|issue=24|doi=10.1175/JCLI3588.1|pages=5,224–5,238|bibcode = 2005JCli...18.5224E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies, including Yu et al. (2003), have indicated some correlation between westerly wind bursts and the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO). These events occur more frequently when the equatorial Pacific warm pool is extended by ENSO events. A significant relationship exists between the frequency of westerly wind bursts and the central equatorial Pacific [[sea surface temperature]]s, with events commonly taking place when {{convert|29|C|F|abbr=on}} temperatures were present. The wind bursts also traveled along with the warm pool, propagating west to east.&lt;ref name="Eisenman2005"/&gt;

A westerly wind burst event can often result in the formation of twin tropical cyclones in the Pacific, with events occurring once per year on average. These events spur counter-clockwise rotation in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and clockwise rotation in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]—a key component of [[Low-pressure area|low pressure systems]].&lt;ref name="NOAAMarch2015"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Di Liberto|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=March 25, 2015|accessdate=January 9, 2016|title=Twin tropical cyclones in western Pacific |url=https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/twin-tropical-cyclones-western-pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during July&amp;nbsp;2015 [[Typhoon Chan-hom (2015)|Typhoon Chan-hom]] and [[2014–15 South Pacific cyclone season#Tropical Cyclone Raquel|Tropical Cyclone Raquel]] developed simultaneously over the Northwestern and Southwestern Pacific, respectively, in conjunction with a westerly wind burst. This was also the only known instance of twin cyclones during July and attributed to the record strength of the [[2014–16 El Niño event]].&lt;ref name="peu"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Pacific ENSO Update|title=A Quarterly Bulletin of the Pacific El Nino-Southern Oscillation Applications Climate (PEAC) Center|date=July 30, 2015|volume=21|number=3|accessdate=January 9, 2016|url=http://www.weather.gov/media/peac/PEU/PEU_v21_n3.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another unusually strong wind burst led to the atypical formations of [[2015 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Depression Nine-C|Tropical Depression Nine-C]] and [[2016 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Pali|Tropical Storm Pali]] in late December&amp;nbsp;2015 and early January&amp;nbsp;2016, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bob Henson|publisher=Weather Underground|date=January 7, 2016|accessdate=January 9, 2016|title=Rare January Depression in Central Pacific; Atlantic Subtropical Storm Next Week?|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=3218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the formation of twin cyclones along the equatorial Pacific can spur the formation of a westerly wind burst and enhance El Niño events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrea Thompson|publisher=Climate Central|date=March 13, 2015|accessdate=January 9, 2016|title=‘Twin’ Cyclones Could Jolt Weak El Nino|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/twin-cyclones-could-jolt-weak-el-nino-18775}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2002, a strong westerly wind burst moved from west to east across the Indian Ocean, producing two separate sets of twin cyclones. It first led to the development of [[Cyclone Kesiny]] in the south-west Indian Ocean and a [[2002 Oman cyclone|storm]] that struck Oman, and later spawned [[2002 North Indian Ocean cyclone season#Deep Depression (02B)|a deep depression]] that struck Myanmar and [[2001–02 Australian region cyclone season#Tropical Cyclone Errol|Tropical Storm Errol]] to the southwest of [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="mf"&gt;{{cite report|publisher=Météo-France|pages=64–75|title=2001–2002 South-West Indian Ocean Cyclone Season|accessdate=2012-10-23|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/anglais/archives/publications/saisons_cycloniques/index20012002.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
